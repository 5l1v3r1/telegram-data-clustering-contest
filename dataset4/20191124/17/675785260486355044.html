      <h1>Raul Sanllehi's opinion on Unai Emery amid calls to sack Arsenal boss</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal fans are making their frustrations heard and a growing number want to see Unai Emery sacked, but Raul Sanllehi is confident the Spaniard can turn things around</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:12:19+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery is under increasing pressure at Arsenal after yet another result went against the Gunners boss this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> were firm favourites to beat relegation-threatened <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> at the Emirates and end their shocking run of five games without a win.</p>
      <p>But the Gunners struggled to even draw, with Alexandre Lacazette coming to the rescue with the final kick of the game to level the scores.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans made their voices heard when the final whistled sounded, and board members were later spotted leaving the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/raul-sanllehi-edu-looked-furious-20946704">Gunners dressing room 'looking furious'.</a></p>
      <p>Emery's job isn't in immediate danger, but as reported by Mirror Sports' chief football writer John Cross, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-edging-closer-arsenal-20949405">there are voices of concern among older board members.</a></p>

      <p>And if Emery fails to turn things around soon then he will almost certainly face the sack.</p>
      <p>One man currently on Emery's side - and perhaps helping to keep him employed at the moment - is Arsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi.</p>
      <p>The 53-year-old Spaniard wants the club to stick with his compatriot as he strongly believes Emery has what it takes to turn things around.</p>
      <p>Sanllehi is calling on his colleagues to give Emery a little more time to prove him right, but time is quickly running out on the Arsenal boss.</p>

      <p>Emery spoke to the press following Saturday's 2-2 draw with Southampton, and vowed to turn things around.</p>
      <p>"The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility," he said.</p>
      <p>"I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I'm going to try to do that. Now my job is to analyse, to try to move on with confidence with the players.</p>

      <p>"It's difficult but we need to move on in the next days. After analysing that match we are going to play at home again on Thursday, prepare as well as possible.</p>
      <p>"We know, and I know, that we need to connect with our supporters."</p>
