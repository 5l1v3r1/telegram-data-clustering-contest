      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:29:40+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>The I'm A Celebrity stars are in for a surprise, and it's not the gruesome bugs out in the jungle, but a smaller pay packet than what they expected when they signed up for the show.</p>
      <p>Celebrities have been paid jaw-dropping sums to enter the jungle this year, with Caitlyn jenner, 70, reportedly coming tops with £500,000, and Ian Wright, 56, said to be getting a sizeable £400,000.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle, ex-member of Girls Aloud was reportedly offered £250,000 and Corrie's Andy Whyment is said to be getting £100,000.</p>
      <p>While the financial compensation seems more than enough to withstand a few creepy crawlies and spine-tingling Bushtucker Trials, many celebrities are unaware that they will only be left with half of what they have been offered once the Australian taxman takes its huge chunk of it.</p>

      <p>Newsreader Michael Buerk, 73, who was on the show in 2014, was shocked to find that after the Australian government had helped itself to its share of his six-figure earnings, he had not much more than half left.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">Daily Star on Sunday</a> : "I was offered I'm A Celebrity a few times and I didn't want to do it.</p>
      <p>"But when the money they were offering got really high, I decided to do it."</p>

      <p>"It gets to the amount of money where you thin, 'why wouldn't I do it for that?'</p>
      <p>"But they neglect to point out that the Australian taxman takes nearly 50% of it straight off the top, which takes some of the cream off."</p>
      <p>Michael says after deciding to do the show for the money, he only ended up with half the amount he thought he'd be getting.</p>
      <p>Although ITV's top bosses are willing to put massive sums on the table to tempt the most high profile celebrities, the jungle stars may have to consider what deals they can get after their stint to really make it worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Former rugby player James Haskell, 34, already has some appearances in the pipeline, while time in the jungle will no doubt boost comedian Andrew Maxwell's Cardiff stand-up tour in April next year.</p>
      <p>* I'm A Celebrity airs nightly at 9pm on ITV</p>
