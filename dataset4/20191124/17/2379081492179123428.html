      <h1>Anna and Elsa Deliver $127 Million for Disney in 'Frozen II' Debut</h1>

      <p>(Bloomberg) — With Walt Disney Co.’s “Frozen II” certain to dominate the domestic the box office this weekend, the only real question was: How big would it be?</p>
      <p>Fans of the royal sisters Anna and Elsa from Arendelle answered that by dropping $127 million this weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters, researcher Comscore Inc. estimated Sunday. That easily eclipsed the new Sony Corp. picture about TV’s Mister Rogers starring Tom Hanks and “21 Bridges,” a police thriller from STX Entertainment.</p>
      <p>Expectations for the film — a sequel to the biggest animated movie of all time — were high. Disney was forecasting opening-weekend sales of as much as $120 million in the U.S. and Canada. Box Office Mojo estimated $120 million, and Box Office Pro projected $130 million.</p>
      <p>Key Insights</p>
      <p>The original “Frozen” is a tough act to follow. That film, featuring the voices of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell, delivered $1.27 billion in global ticket sales and stayed in the top 5 domestically for three months. While those stars have returned for the sequel, meeting that high mark will be difficult.</p>
      <p>The Mister Rogers film, “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” missed forecasts of $16 million to $17 million, coming in at $13.5 million. Hanks stars as the beloved children’s TV host in a story about Fred Rogers’s real-life friendship with a journalist assigned to write a story about him.”21 Bridges” features “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman in a story about an NYPD detective in a manhunt for two cop killers. Analysts’ forecasts ranged from $8.4 million to $9.7 million. The film came in fourth at $9.3 million.Sales for the top 10 films this weekend were expected to decline from the same weekend in 2018, because Thanksgiving came earlier last year, making comparisons tough. Box Office Pro was forecasting a 2% to 7% drop.</p>
