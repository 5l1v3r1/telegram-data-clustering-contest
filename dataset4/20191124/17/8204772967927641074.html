      <h2>Former Anglo banker and wife lodge planning application to Wicklow County Council</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:55:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/simon-carswell-7.1010742" target="_blank">Simon Carswell</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Anglo+Irish+Bank">Anglo Irish Bank</a> chairman Sean FitzPatrick is seeking permission to build a new house at the back of his <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Greystones">Greystones</a> home, five years after emerging from bankruptcy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Wicklow">Wicklow</a> County Council records show that Mr FitzPatrick and his wife Catriona want to demolish a single-storey, fire-damaged dwelling known as Meadow Garden and replace it with a two-storey, four-bedroom house with a new entrance at Farm Lane at the back of their existing home.</p>
      <p>The FitzPatricks want to build external terraces at ground and first-floor levels along with a garden. They are looking to include parking spaces for two vehicles next to the property.</p>
      <p>Mr FitzPatrick said he did not want to make any comment about his plans for the property when contacted by The Irish Times on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The couple held on to their home, Camaderry, next to Greystones Golf Club on Whitshed Road in the Co Wicklow seaside town after FitzPatrick was declared a bankrupt in 2010 with debts of €147 million and assets of just €47 million in the wake of the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
      <p>Meadow Gardens was valued at €550,000 by Mr FitzPatrick when he filed for bankruptcy in 2010, according to his statement of affairs outlining his assets and liabilities.</p>
      <p>Court records showed that Ms FitzPatrick was entitled to a share of the cash held in bank accounts jointly held with her husband. Her share amounted to more than €1.1 million in June 2010.</p>

      <p>Official assignees, the court-appointed officials who manage a bankruptcy estate, can sell the bankrupt’s interest in their home to their spouse if they are not using funds belonging to the bankrupt.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Property+Registration+Authority">Property Registration Authority</a> records show that Ms FitzPatrick bought her husband’s share in their jointly owned home from Mr FitzPatrick’s official assignee <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Chris+Lehane">Chris Lehane</a> for €430,000 in May.</p>
      <h3>Asset transfer</h3>
      <p>The property along with Meadow Garden was transferred from Mr Lehane to Ms FitzPatrick the same month, according to Registry of Deeds records filed the following month.</p>
      <p>The transfer took place after Ms FitzPatrick settled her legal action against the official assignee claiming that she was entitled to €6 million of her husband’s assets on the basis that she had a beneficial interest in some assets given that she had made payments towards loans for assets.</p>
      <p>Ms FitzPatrick had also brought a claim under family law.</p>
      <p>Mr Lehane, representing Mr FitzPatrick’s bankruptcy estate, had taken his own legal proceedings against Ms FitzPatrick and the couple’s three adult children, David, Jonathan and Sara.</p>
      <p>All the proceedings involving Ms FitzPatrick were settled in May.</p>
      <p>Details of the planning application, lodged on November 18th, were first reported by The Sunday Times. A decision is due from the council by January 21st.</p>
      <p>In May 2017 Mr FitzPatrick was acquitted on criminal counts of allegedly misleading Anglo’s auditors about tens of millions of euro in loans concealed from the public between 2002 and 2007.</p>
      <p>He resigned as chairman of the bank in December 2008, almost a month before it was nationalised, after the true extent of his loans, amounting to about €122 million, were disclosed by the bank.</p>
      <p>In an earlier trial, in April 2014, the 71-year-old former banker, who built Anglo in the country’s third largest bank, was acquitted by a jury on all charges against him relating to an unlawful share-buying scheme involving 10 wealthy customers aimed at shoring up the bank’s share price.</p>
