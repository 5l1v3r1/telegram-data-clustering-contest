      <p>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian President Iván Duque is opening a national dialogue aimed at including citizens in drafting reforms to tackle issues like corruption and inequality.</p>
      <p>Duque initiated the dialogue Sunday by gathering recently elected mayors and governors for a meeting in Bogota and announcing a plan of action.</p>
      <p>The president outlined six focal topics: bringing economic growth with equality; attacking corruption; bettering education; improving life in areas hard hit by the nation’s long civil conflict; protecting the environment; and strengthening government institutions.</p>
      <p>Duque said the talks will include all Colombians and run through March 15.</p>
      <p>Thousands took to the streets Thursday in one of the nation’s biggest protests in recent history. Organizers are seeking to keep up the momentum with a student protest Monday.</p>
