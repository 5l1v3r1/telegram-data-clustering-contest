      <h4>Team News</h4>
      <p>For PSG, Marco Verratti is doubtful for the clash against the Spanish giants while Thilo Kehrer, too, in unlikely to be fit. Meanwhile, the Galacticos have four players out injured in the form of James Rodriguez, Lucas Vazquez, Nacho and Marco Asensio.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Real Madrid: Thibaut Courtois; Dani Carvajal, Raphael Varane, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo; Casemiro, Fede Valverde, Toni Kroos; Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard, Karim Benzema</i>

      <h4>Prediction</h4>
      <p>Real Madrid need the win more than PSG, who have already qualified for the next round. However, that doesn’t mean that the French giants will take it easy in this match.</p>
      <p>They will have Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in their attack, making them a real threat to the Galacticos path to qualification. Meanwhile, the Merengues have found form after a rocky start to the reason.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of Fede Valverde the starting XI has unlocked the best version of both Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. Eden Hazard is also slowly returning to the peak of his powers, which is why we could expect this to be a great clash.</p>
