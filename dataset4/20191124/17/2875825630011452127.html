      <h1>Woeful Phil Jones hauled off at half-time as Graeme Souness slams Man Utd defender</h1>

      <p>Manchester United defender Phil Jones endured a miserable 45 minutes at Sheffield United, making a crucial mistake before being hooked off and slammed by pundit Graeme Souness.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay's injury saw Jones come in for his first Premier League start of the season for United but it was an appearance to forget for the former Blackburn ace.</p>
      <p>Jones was easily outmuscled by Lys Mousset before John Fleck ultimately handed the hosts a deserved lead at Bramall Lane on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>And to compound Jones' misery, he was hauled off at half-time and replaced by Jesse Lingard as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer opted for a chance of tactics.</p>

      <p>At half-time, Sky Sports pundit Souness laid into the defender and was baffled as to why he didn't clear the danger.</p>
      <p>He said: “Jones has done everything wrong for the goal. Protect the ball. Try and get your team a goal kick or at worse put it out for a throw in.</p>
      <p>"He just gets it all wrong. Jones isn’t a cute player – he hasn’t got a great touch, so he should just put it into row Z at worst.”</p>

      <p>Gary Neville echoed Souness' views - although he reckons that any of the 11 players who started could have been hooked off at the break.</p>
      <p>The United legend said: “I don’t think any of the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> players could have complained about being taken off at half-time – they were awful. He had to change something.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's decision to haul off Jones seemingly didn't pay off, as the Blades doubled their lead in the second half through a fine Mousset strike.</p>
      <p>A lovely through-ball from Fleck found Mousset in the middle of Manchester United's half and he marched forward before sending a low drive into the bottom corner of De Gea's net from 25 yards.</p>
