      <p><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/pixel-3-amazon-deal/">Google Pixel 3 deals deliver new Amazon all-time lows</a> while <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/pixel-3-amazon-deal/">Pixel 4 is $200 off</a>. We also spotted <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/google-pixel-slate-m3-keyboard-bundle/">Pixel Slate with a keyboard case at $449</a>, and <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/apple-airpods-black-friday-deals/">AirPods are on sale as well</a>. You’ll find all that and more in the 9to5Toys Lunch Break below.</p>
      <h3>Google Pixel 3 deals abound for Black Friday</h3>
      <p>Amazon offers <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/pixel-3-amazon-deal/">Google Pixel 3 64GB for <b>$349</b></a> in unlocked condition. As a comparison, it typically goes for $500 with today’s deal being a new Amazon all-time low. Better Black Friday deals may be on the horizon, but those prices have yet to be confirmed. This is the best price we’ve tracked to date. The <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/pixel-3-amazon-deal/">larger Pixel 3 XL is also on sale for <b>$449</b></a>, down from its regular $550 price tag. Pixel 3 sports Android 9.0 Pie, offers an OLED display with HDR, 12MP camera and more. At this price, it offers some of the best value for your money in the mid- to upper-tier of smartphones available currently. In our hands-on review, we called it the best Android device on the market and better than some of the latest generation iPhones.</p>
      <p>Looking for Pixel 4? Amazon is now offering <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/pixel-3-amazon-deal/">Black Friday pricing at <b>$200 off</b> both Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL with deals from <b>$599</b></a>. That’s the best price we’ve tracked on unlocked versions of Google’s latest device.</p>
      <h3>Google Pixel Slate bundle on sale</h3>
      <p>Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/google-pixel-slate-m3-keyboard-bundle/">Google Pixel Slate Intel Core m3 Tablet bundled with a keyboard for <b>$449</b></a>. Usually selling for $998, today’s offer is good for a 55% discount, beats our previous mention on the tablet alone by $81, and marks a new all-time low. The entire experience here is centered around a 12.3-inch touchscreen molecule display. Google has armed its Pixel Slate with 64GB of on-board storage, as well as 8GB of RAM and ten hours of battery life. Plus, throw in the keyboard and you’ll be ready to take work on-the-go. You can dive into our <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/06/15/google-pixel-slate-m3/">hands-on review</a> for a closer look. More details below.</p>
      <h3>AirPods hit Amazon all-time low</h3>
      <p>Amazon offers <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/apple-airpods-black-friday-deals/">Apple AirPods 2 with charging case for <b>$134</b></a>. As a comparison, today’s deal is $25 off the regular price and a new Amazon all-time low. We did see them hit $126 once before at Rakuten. You can grab the same <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/apple-airpods-black-friday-deals/">AirPods with the wireless charging case for <b>$165 </b>(Reg. $199)</a>. The second-generation AirPods offer support for “Hey, Siri” and include Apple’s upgraded H1 chip for fast wireless pairing.

You can still <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/apple-airpods-black-friday-deals/">pick them up at the Amazon all-time low price of <b>$235</b></a>. That’s down from the usual $249 price.
