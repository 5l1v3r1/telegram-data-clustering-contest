      <p>David Chaum, who’s widely known for inventing the world’s first digital currency, called “e-Cash,” during the early 1980s, revealed on November 22 the upcoming release of the xx network whitepaper and the Praxxis technical brief.</p>
      <p>The brief will reportedly provide details and key insights into the xx network and “xx coin,” a blockchain and cryptocurrency supported by Elixxir and Praxxis technology.</p>
      <p>According to a press release shared with <i>Crowdfund Insider</i>, Chaum has “described key features of the xx network consensus protocol, including quantum-secure trustless initialization, an unmanipulatable random seed, constant-sized endorser sampling, and compact quantum-secure group signatures which provide unprecedented efficiency.”</p>
      <p>The release mentioned that the xx network is combined or integrated with the Elixxir “metadata-shredding” technology. The xx network offers a “protected digital sphere” where people can share project ideas and concepts, sell various products and services, and securely and privately exchange value.</p>
      <p>The xx network whitepaper and the Praxxis technical brief should be available next week, the release noted.</p>
      <p>Chaum stated:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The xx network and xx coin will empower individuals to protect their privacy and choose how data is collected about their digital lives. In a world where digital privacy is threatened by large, powerful organizations, the xx network and xx coin secure parity between individuals and centralized powers.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The announcement was reportedly made in Amsterdam at the Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (“National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science”), where Chaum performed pioneering research on digital currencies and cryptography systems.</p>
      <p>The lecture is part of a two-day event which featured Chaum being honored with the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/news/2019/david-chaum-and-guido-van-rossum-awarded-dijkstra-fellowship">Dijkstra Fellowship</a>.</p>
