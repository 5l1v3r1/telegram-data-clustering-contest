      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:35:15+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Jack Grealish has sent a message to Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli after the England international helped his side to a 3-2 victory over West Ham United.</p>
      <p>In Jose Mourinho’s first match in charge as manager, Spurs took all three points against their London rivals on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Alli wasn’t on the scoresheet but played the majority of the game before being replaced by Christian Eriksen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish</a> wasn’t in action with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> having to wait until Monday night to face Newcastle United and took to social media to congratulate Alli.</p>
      <p>Replying to a post on Alli’s Instagram account, the Villa star wrote: “Man like Del” followed by several emojis.</p>

      <p>Grealish has been heavily linked with Tottenham in recent summer transfer windows but stayed put to help guide Villa to promotion back to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He’s missed the last three fixtures in all competitions with a calf injury but is expected to return against Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> said this week: "He's been OK, frustrated with the injury, has been in a rich vein of form, nominated for October player of the month and, unfortunately, picked up a dead calf at the end of the game against Manchester City. Then he ended up missing Liverpool and Wolves which he thought he'd make both games but he didn't.</p>
      <p>"The fact he hasn't got called up, we've spoken at length about that. He can't control that but what he can control is he can keep performing, making sure he keeps the pressure on the people who have to make them decisions.</p>
      <p>"He's ready (for Newcastle). He's one of the fittest lads there, always doing extras after training as well. He's fit and ready."</p>
