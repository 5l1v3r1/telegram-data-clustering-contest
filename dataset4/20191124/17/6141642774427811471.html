      <p>A pair of 22-kilowatt fast-chargers, each with capacity for two vehicles, are available for shoppers at the Channel Islands Co-operative Society’s Grand Marché store in St Peter.</p>
      <p>The Co-op has worked with Jersey Energy – a sister company of Jersey Electricity – to install the chargers, which are to be operated with a contactless card or mobile app.</p>
      <p>There are now 29 public charging points in the Island, with further chargers due to be brought in by the end of the year at En Route in St Peter and Grand Marché in St Helier.</p>
      <p>Jim Plumley, Co-op chief development officer, said: ‘We welcome the rise in electric vehicles in Jersey and want to help by offering our customers charge points. This is one of a number of steps we are making to reduce our impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>‘Most people with electric cars would probably charge them at home – but we are hoping to offer Islanders a convenient alternative when they do their weekly shop.’</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Jersey Electricity said that 30 minutes’ charging would cost £2.31 at daytime electricity rates and top up the battery of a typical electric vehicle by approximately 50%.</p>
      <p>Jersey Electricity chief executive Chris Ambler said: ‘We are delighted to work with the Co-op, which has always been a leader in sustainable business practices. This installation is another step on the road to extending our network to 75 by the end of 2020, as we seek to inspire a zero-carbon Jersey and actively support the government’s 2030 carbon neutrality ambitions.’</p>
