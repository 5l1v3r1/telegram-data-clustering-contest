      <p>According to the INA news agency, Iraq is setting up defence structures along the border in the provinces of Nineveh and Anbar.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a regional representative of Iraqi Kurdistan, which occupies a part of northern Iraq, said that up to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911151077309715-us-opposes-international-tribunal-for-daesh-fighters---senior-diplomat/">20,000 Daesh fighters still remained</a> in Iraq and Syria.</p>
      <p>In early November, the US news outlet NBC said that militants from the Daesh terrorist group, following their defeat in Syria, were <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911231077383728-around-500-us-personnel-remain-in-eastern-syria-to-counter-daesh-operations---centcom/">moving across the border into northern Iraq</a> to rebuild their forces there.</p>
      <p>The jihadists received a powerful blow last month when Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died in Idlib during a US military operation. The terrorists were also targeted by Turkish forces during Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria, which made them flee the region.</p>

      <p>Iraq announced the defeat of the organisation in late 2017, three years after it overran much of the country. By March 2019, Iraqi forces, backed by US-led coalition airstrikes, recaptured all the territories occupied by the terrorist group in Iraq.</p>
