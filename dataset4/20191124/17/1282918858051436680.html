      <p>Govinda and Jackie Shroff have been directed by a consumer court to pay a fine of Rs 26,710 after the two and a company they had promoted a product for, were pulled over the court, reports claimed. The actors and the company were reportedly accused of ‘fraud’ by a man, who claimed that the advertisements of a herbal pain relief oil, from five years ago, turned out to be misleading. The court ruled in favour of the disgruntled consumer. </p>

      <blockquote>As per a reports, a man named Abhinav Agarwal from Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, moved a consumer court in Muzaffarnagar after being dissatisfied with the results of a herbal pain relief oil named Sandhi Sudha. Agarwal, a lawyer by profession, had purchased the product in July 2012, after coming across an advertisement in a newspaper featuring Govinda, Jackie Shroff.  He said that he bought it for his father for joint pain. He also claimed that the company promised complete relief in 15 days and a full refund if their promise was not fulfilled.<br/><br/>However, Agarwal said he did not witness any visible results in the time frame and then approached a representative of the Madhya Pradesh-based company, who suggested that he contacts the company directly. He then sent the product back via courier. Agarwal claimed that the company refused to issue a refund to him and even started ‘harassing’ him. As per reports, he said that he bought the product after seeing the advertisement  featuring Govinda and Jackie Shroff. Slamming the company for its claim of providing relief in 15 days, he said that everything had turned out to be a ‘fraud.’ </blockquote>
