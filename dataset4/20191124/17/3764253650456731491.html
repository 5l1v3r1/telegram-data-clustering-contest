      <p>The APC chieftain said that the Yari “is a man of proven integrity, highly respected and responsible leader whose mission is always to improve the well-being of his people.”</p>
      <p>Ibrahim also said that the former governor would not stoop so low to encourage crime in a state he ruled for two terms.</p>
      <p><i>“So, there is no how a religious and knowledgeable person like former governor who led a state for a period of eight years would bring himself so low, so cheap, to be instigating criminals against the people,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>He went on to say that Yari only paid a visit to his hometown, Talata Mafara, and has not visited any other place in the state since he left government on May 29, adding that any meeting he held was always under the monitoring of security agencies.</p>
      <p>The spokesman in the statement said despite the window-dressing by the governor, bandit attack has been happening under his leadership.</p>

        <i>“Gentlemen of the press, let me draw your attention to contradictions by both the governor and his commissioner of police who leads the so-called peace initiative in the state.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The governor accused the former governor of breaching the security, while his commissioner of police recently summoned an emergency stakeholders meeting with leaders of abattoirs, cattle markets, and Meyetti Allah cattle breeders associations in the state where he vowed to deal decisively with any one indulging himself in nefarious business that leads to the resurfacing of banditry activities in some parts of the state,” </i>the statement partly read.</p>
