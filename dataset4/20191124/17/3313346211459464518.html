I think it’ll be fixed easily enough, possibly even today, and I’m still having fun with it as it is. But, in the game’s franchise mode at least, the promise of “build your own zoo, with whatever you like in it” has quietly been phased out for “in the grim darkness of the international animal trade, there is only warthogs”."<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9K0eJEmMEw">The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx -- Behind Closed Doors at Valve</a> <i>(Geoff Keighley / YouTube - VIDEO)</i><br/>"In 2020, Geoff Keighley (The Game Awards) returns to his landmark Final Hours series for a new chapter chronicling Valve’s surprising return to the Half-Life series.

I believe in and value these things wholeheartedly, because I’ve extensive experience with both. I also believe competition has a dark side.

But of these many unsung elements, none is so maligned or as misunderstood as the humble video game ladder. Now that the ultimate in ladder-carrying simulators has burst onto the market in the form of Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding, it’s worth examining why they’re so widely maligned."<br/><br/><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/how-modern-warfare-smooths-over-the-horrors-of-war/">How Modern Warfare smooths over the horrors of war</a> <i>(Nick Capozzoli / Ars Technica - ARTICLE)</i><br/>"It's not that “We need that truck” and “Find a gun" are unusual orders to be given in a video game.
