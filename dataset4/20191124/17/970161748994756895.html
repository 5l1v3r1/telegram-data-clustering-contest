      <p>RuPaul’s Drag Race UK has only finished this week, but already one queen has sashayed away from the group WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>The 10 queens reunited to see one of their own be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/rupauls-drag-race-uk-winner-celebrates-named-first-ever-series-champ-11203921/">crowned the UK’s first </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rupauls-drag-race/">drag race</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/rupauls-drag-race-uk-winner-celebrates-named-first-ever-series-champ-11203921/"> superstar</a> at the finale, which premiered last Thursday.</p>
      <p>Obviously, with all the drama of the series, that was going to be one active group chat – and now Divina DiCampo has revealed that one of the stars already couldn’t stand the constant notifications.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Digital Spy, Divina revealed: ‘Scaredy [Kat]’s already left the WhatsApp group.</p>
      <p>‘I keep checking in with her, it’s not that she isn’t contactable to people, but there is so many messages to trawl through.’</p>
      <p>We get it Scaredy! We love ourselves the odd mute every now and again to have a breather, especially when there’s so much going on.</p>

      <p>And let’s be honest, all the queens’ lives have well and truly exploded over the past few weeks, as UK drag cemented itself as a force to be reckoned with across the world.</p>

      <p>So how’s series runner-up Divina handling the group?</p>
      <p>‘I’m like your mum on Facebook, she doesn’t post anything but she’s always watching and doing a little like here and there,’ she laughed.</p>
      <p>Divina, Baga Chipz and The Vivienne went tooth and nail to the final, pulling out all the stops in the multi-layered challenge for the last round.</p>

      <p>The final three were put through their paces in the last mega challenge, which saw them learn dance routines from Strictly’s AJ Pritchard and Love Island brother Curtis Pritchard, as well as appear on RuPaul and Michelle Visage’s podcast, What’s The Tee?</p>
      <p>Finally they had to come up with their own lyrics to RuPaul’s Rock It [To The Moon] <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/drag-race-uk-winner-rupaul-vivienne-baga-chipz-divina-dicampo-11197257/">before The Winner was crowned.</a></p>

      <p>But Divina has admitted that she found the whole thing hard, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/rupauls-michelle-visage-almost-caused-divina-dicampo-quit-show-cried-unaired-footage-11203218/">almost quit after some harsh critique from Michelle Visage</a>.</p>
      <p>She also told how the audience didn’t see parts of the show and revealed how it made her look like a ‘crazy person’ – which made her question her position in the competition.</p>
