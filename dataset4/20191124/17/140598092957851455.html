      <h1>Whaley Bridge police chief reveals 'sexist and homophobic' abuse over hairstyle led her to quit social media</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:22:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Whaley Bridge police chief Rachel Swann has revealled that “sexist and homophobic” abuse over her hairstyle led her to quit social media. </p>
      <p>Deputy chief constable Rachel Swann appeared in front of the national media in August when a dam at Toddbrook Reservoir partially collapsed, putting the town of Whaley Bridge at risk of flooding. Roughly 1,500 residents were evacuated from the area. </p>
      <p>But the officer said attention was drawn away from the incident as people instead focused on criticising her appearance.</p>
      <p>One comment said: "Is that what a senior police officer looks like these days??"</p>
      <p>She said she was also called a “disgrace” and berated for not wearing a hat. </p>
      <p>Ms Swann said: "Yes, I am a woman. Yes, I might have a slightly different hairstyle. Yes, I am quite small. </p>
      <p>"The bit that astounded me was I could not believe that my mere existence could cause such a depth of feeling."</p>
      <p>"I can take a bit of banter but then it became sexist and homophobic, and really, really insulting.</p>
      <p>"The bit that really hurt was when people said I had no standards and I was letting policing down."</p>
      <p>She added that she had been advised not to wear a hat so the public could see her eyes and “gain trust."</p>
      <p>Councillor Barry Lewis, Lincolnshire PCC, jumped to her defence and tweeted that Ms Swann had “saved the valley” during the emergency at Whaley Bridge and “that’s what’s important.'' </p>
      <p>The Lincolnshire police and crime commissioner Marc Jones said Ms Swann was “outstanding” and that the criticism was from “largely retired, male ex-cops”.</p>
      <p>He said: "A group of largely retired, male ex cops have an issue with her 'modern' hairstyle.</p>
      <p> “She's a respected, able officer, exactly the sort of person we should encourage to rise to the top of policing.” </p>
      <p>Derbyshire Chief Constable Peter Goodman branded the remarks "unnecessary and hurtful" and said that he was “proud” to have her as his deputy chief constable in Derbyshire. </p>
      <p>Ms Swann who began her career in Leicestershire Police and joined the Derbyshire force in 2019 said the abuse has been recorded as a hate incident. </p>
