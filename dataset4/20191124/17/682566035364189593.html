      <p>Bruz - Two-time Grand Tour winner<b> Nairo Quintana</b> will target victory in all the races he takes part in with his new French outfit Arkea Samsic, the Colombian told AFP at his new team base on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was a two-time winner of the best young rider on the Tour de France, won the Giro and the Vuelta, but has left major Spanish outfit Movistar to try his luck with a team not yet in cycling's top tier.</p>
      <p>"We hope to pick up invitations to as many classics and Tours as possible," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>"France is the country where it's at in terms of cycling, there's lots of teams and lots of races," said Quintana, a huge star in his homeland who will now be based in Brittany.</p>
      <p>"I want to win every race we enter, starting with Paris-Nice," he said of the March eight-day Tour where he ended runner-up to Egan Bernal last season.</p>
      <p>"France is also where I achieved my greatest success," said Bernal, who has finished on the Tour de France podium three times.</p>
      <p>The 2020 route for the Tour de France would suit a climber of Quintana's qualities, but his team will need a wild card entry, and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic route looks good for a climber and Colombia can take five riders.</p>
      <p>"The Tour route looks good, especially with that uphill time-trial at the end, it's in a place I know well," he said of the tough and potentially decisive stage of 'Planche des Belles Filles'.</p>
      <p>"And I would love to be selected for the Olympic Games, I have missed two of them," said Quintana, who appears to take great pride in representing his nation.</p>
