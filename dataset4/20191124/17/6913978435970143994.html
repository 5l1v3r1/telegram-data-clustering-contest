      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>RIYADH —</b> The uniform worn by women organizers and receptionists at the foundation stone laying ceremony of Diriyah Gate, held last Wednesday, was the innovative work of a young Saudi fashion designer Mashael Al-Faris. The credit goes to her for accomplishing the total work of the uniform, from drawing, selecting materials and knitting in a short period of two weeks.<br/><br/>Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman inaugurated the Diriyah Gate project by laying the foundation stone to mark the launch of one of the Kingdom’s most important projects. The project is a cultural and lifestyle tourism destination for the Kingdom with a UNESCO World Heritage Site at its heart.<br/><br/>Al-Faris, who hails from Diriyah Gate, visited the historical neighborhood of Al-Turaif in Diriyah from where she imbibed the salient ancient heritage features, and designed a costume with incorporating features of modern fashion designing in a way matching fully the historical designs of Diriyah.<br/><br/>Al-Faris derived the idea of the golden belt worn by the participants at the Diriyah ceremony from the traditional Saudi dress Mishlah. Speaking to Arab.Net, Al-Fares said she was very keen to ensure that the uniforms of the participants are modest and reflect the originality and grandeur of the event. Al Faris used high quality materials to ensure the elegance of distinctive designs, making tangible efforts in selecting light and comfortable fabrics.<br/><br/>The colors of the fashion designs were different from one another in accordance with the type of jobs assigned to the women organizers. The beige color was chosen for those who were in the reception of the delegations for royal event to match the colors and designs of the reception halls and these colors are closest to the color of the old buildings, while the green color was used for the participants in the organization at the entrance of the royal amphitheater and dinner hall.<br/><br/>Al-Faris attended a fashion design school in Australia and launched her first fashion collection in 2010 in Riyadh.</p>
