      <p>Saffron Barker is fearing a surprise Strictly Come Dancing exit this week because of AJ Pritchard's 'samba curse.</p>
      <p>The YouTube sensation is concerned they will become the next pair to leave the competition due to a worrying trend - and because they were bottom of Saturday night's leaderboard.</p>
      <p>Professional dancer AJ has been kicked out of Strictly on the same dance for the last two years - so will lightening strike twice?</p>
      <p>After performing their samba to Walking On Sunshine, Saffron tweeted: "May not of got the highest scores, but the samba is tough!!! And i had THE TIME OF MY LIFE!!!"</p>
      <p>Pleading with viewers, she added: "AJ has gone home every year with the Samba.. please vote for him and us!!"</p>

      <p>AJ also admitted he was worried about the 'samba curse' on Tuesday night's It Takes Two.</p>
      <p>He told host Rylan Clark Neal: "Unfortunately the past two years I've gone out on a samba.</p>
      <p>"This is not going to happen. This is going to be the year. Samba curse gone."</p>
      <p>Fearful Saffron added: "It's like really sad. I'm praying. Every year it's happened to him. We can't let it happen again."</p>

      <p>Saffron and AJ will be hoping to be saved by the public after finishing at the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>The couple only achieved a score of 26 - with Craig Revel Horwood giving a harsh mark of 5 and slamming her "sloppy footwork".</p>
      <p>Bruno Tonioli praised her strong performance, admitting their were some mistakes, and called her "Little Miss Sunshine".</p>

      <p>Head judge Shirley Ballas said: "You certainly brought a nice bright samba today. Were there a few issues? Yes, here and there.</p>
      <p>"But generally for one of the most difficult dances you had good absorption through the body and feet and I was quite pleased with you."</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse added: "I saw energy, you giving it a go, and I didn't see you at any time looking confused. I would like a samba with more interaction in the body but it's a difficult dance and you went for it. Well done."</p>
