      <p>Barron's representatives gave away the Thanksgiving birds at Prichard City Hall and in Toulminville, <a href="https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/steelers-mark-barron-gives-away-1500-turkeys-for-thanksgiving.html">AL.com </a>reported.</p>
      <p>Barron, who starred at the University of Alabama and was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2012 NFL draft, signed with the Steelers as a free agent in 2019.</p>
      <p>Barron was unable to attend Saturday's giveaway, as he was in Cincinnati as the Steelers prepared to face the Bengals on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Michelle Barron, his mother, said it was "a great honor" to pass out turkeys again, <a href="https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/steelers-mark-barron-gives-away-1500-turkeys-for-thanksgiving.html">AL.com</a> reported.</p>
      <p>"When the kids were younger, we had to go to the Catholic Social Services or the Salvation Army," Michelle Barron told <a href="https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/steelers-mark-barron-gives-away-1500-turkeys-for-thanksgiving.html">AL.com</a>. "When we first started, I was like, 'Mark, do you think a turkey's going to be enough?' He said, 'Yeah, Mama, when I was small, I was looking for that turkey.'</p>
      <p>"I think it's a real privilege for him, and I think a lot of my son for doing this, because he don't have to, so it's a real privilege."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tapnfp.org/">Together Assisting People Inc. </a>coordinated the event and tapped into the Mobile Kappa League to do much of the heavy lifting in loading and unloading the turkeys.</p>
      <p>"We're able to be hands on the ground, boots on the ground for him," Chris Rogers, the organization's founder, told<a href="https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/steelers-mark-barron-gives-away-1500-turkeys-for-thanksgiving.html"> AL.com</a>, "and create his vision, what he wants to do for his community. And that's the biggest thing that he wanted -- to make sure his people know that he loves him. And we love doing this."</p>
