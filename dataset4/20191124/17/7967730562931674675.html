      <p>The 19-year-old was the toast of the 2019 Swimming Australia Awards in Sydney on Sunday night, cleaning up by also claiming Short Course Swimmer of the Year and sharing the Patron Award.</p>
      <p>Tasmanian-born, Brisbane-based Titmus already had plenty to celebrate in a breakout 2019 after famously dethroning American great Katie Ledecky to claim 400m freestyle gold at this year's world titles in South Korea in July.</p>
      <p>It marked the first time Ledecky – a 14-time world champion – had been beaten over 400m, 800m or 1500m freestyle at a major international meet since 2012.</p>
      <p>Titmus also became the first Australian to win the world 400m title since Tracey Wickham back in 1978.</p>

      <p>She also inspired Australia's 4x200m freestyle gold at Gwangju, claimed in a new world record as part of her four-medal haul in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Their time eclipsed China's 2009 supersuit world record mark by 0.58 of a second and also marked the first time Australia had claimed the women's 4x200m relay world title.</p>
      <p>Titmus' heroics helped Australia finish second overall on the world titles medal tally behind the all-conquering Americans.</p>

      <p>The teenager sounded her intentions for 2019 by claiming 400m freestyle gold at the world short course titles in yet another world record time and winning the 200m final.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, Titmus's mentor Dean Boxall was named Coach of the Year and Youth Coach of the Year for 2019.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kareena – the first Australian swimmer selected on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic team – was named Open Water Swimmer of the Year after her top 10 finish in the women's 10km Open event at the world titles.</p>
