      <h1>Janelle Monáe's Antebellum Looks Like the Next Big Thing in Horror — Watch the Surreal Trailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:00:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kelsey Garcia</a></address>
      <p>A mysterious new thriller will address <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Horror-Movies-Coming-Out-2019-45510404">the horror of history</a>. Though little can be gleaned from the just-released teaser, <b>Antebellum</b> seems to follow a successful present-day author who finds herself haunted by — and potentially trapped in — an antebellum era narrative. The film features a stacked cast consisting of Janelle Monáe, Marque Richardson, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Gabourey-Sidibe">Gabourey Sidibe</a>, Jena Malone, and more.</p>
      <p><b>Antebellum</b> will mark the feature debut for creative duo Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz, who previously made names for themselves in activism and advertising. <b><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Get-Out">Get Out</a></b>, <b>Us</b>, and <b>BlacKkKlansman</b> producer Sean McKittrick is also attached to the film, which is a good sign. Watch the mind-bending teaser above before <b>Antebellum</b> hits theaters on April 24, 2020.</p>
