      <h1>Woeful Phil Jones hauled off at half-time as Graeme Souness slams Man Utd defender</h1>
      <h2>Jones was easily outmuscled by Lys Mousset before John Fleck ultimately handed Sheffield United a deserved lead at Bramall Lane on Sunday afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:49:31+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United defender Phil Jones endured a miserable 45 minutes at Sheffield United, making a crucial mistake before being hooked off and slammed by pundit Graeme Souness.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay's injury saw Jones come in for his first Premier League start of the season for United but it was an appearance to forget for the former Blackburn ace.</p>
      <p>Jones was easily outmuscled by Lys Mousset before John Fleck ultimately handed the hosts a deserved lead at Bramall Lane on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>And to compound Jones' misery, he was hauled off at half-time and replaced by Jesse Lingard as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer opted for a chance of tactics.</p>

      <p>At half-time, Sky Sports pundit Souness laid into the defender and was baffled as to why he didn't clear the danger.</p>
      <p>He said: “Jones has done everything wrong for the goal. Protect the ball. Try and get your team a goal kick or at worse put it out for a throw in.</p>
      <p>"He just gets it all wrong. Jones isn’t a cute player – he hasn’t got a great touch, so he should just put it into row Z at worst.”</p>

      <p>Gary Neville echoed Souness' views - although he reckons that any of the 11 players who started could have been hooked off at the break.</p>
      <p>The United legend said: “I don’t think any of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> players could have complained about being taken off at half-time – they were awful. He had to change something.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's decision to haul off Jones seemingly didn't pay off, as the Blades doubled their lead in the second half through a fine Mousset strike.</p>
      <p>A lovely through-ball from Fleck found Mousset in the middle of Manchester United's half and he marched forward before sending a low drive into the bottom corner of De Gea's net from 25 yards.</p>

      <p>Manchester United turned the game on its head as three quickfire goals from their academy graduates put them 3-2 up.</p>
      <p>Brandon Williams scored his first goal for the club in the 72nd minute before substitute Mason Greenwood connected with a superb Marcus Rashford cross five minutes later to level things up.</p>
      <p>And Rashford put the visitors in front with a goal of his own two minutes later.</p>
      <p>But Sheffield United mounted a comeback of their own and Oli McBurnie volleyed home in stoppage time to secure a deserved point for the hosts.</p>
