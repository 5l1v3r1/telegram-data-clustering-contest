      <p>John Boyega has opened up about his sweet friendship with fellow film star Robert Downey Jr. in a new interview.</p>
      <p>In fact the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a>: Rise of Skywalker star says the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>: Endgame icon has become something of a mentor to him.</p>
      <p>John, 27, told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/john-boyega-interview-the-star-wars-actor-on-fame-family-and-lunch-with-robert-downey-jr-fs5r2q955">The Times</a>: ‘When I was starting out, I didn’t really know what to think and I wanted to get some advice.</p>
      <p>‘I was a huge fan of [Robert’s]. I think our agents spoke, and then he called me up out of nowhere and we had a good long chat.</p>
      <p>What happened next is pretty amazing.</p>
      <p>‘He was, like, “Next time you’re in LA, come to the house,”‘ John explained. ‘And I went to his frikkin’ amazing house — and Orlando Bloom was there eating pancakes. I stayed there all Sunday eating good food with nice people.’</p>

      <p>Robert’s reputation as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood continues. What we wouldn’t have given to have been a fly on the wall at that particular brunch…</p>

      <p>As well as the Star Wars films, John has appeared in movies such as Detroit, The Circle and Half of a Yellow Sun.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Robert’s film credits include Sherlock Holmes, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Zodiac.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, John, who is single, discussed whether or not thirsty fans slide into his DMs.</p>
      <p>‘My DMs are dry!’ he joked. ‘The other day, my mates were, like, “Let’s go in your DMs, let’s see what it’s like [to be famous].” My boy scrolls through, like [he grimaces], “Bruv, this person is asking you what planet Tatooine is on.”’</p>
      <p>Classic.</p>
