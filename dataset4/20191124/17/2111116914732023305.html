      <p>Walmart have unleashed their PlayStation VR Black Friday bundle upon us, and you can pick up a headset and five excellent games for under $200 right now. Included in this fantastic price are PlayStation Worlds, Skyrim, Astro Bot, Resident Evil 7, and Everybody's Golf VR, a great selection from across the broad landscape of experiences available on PSVR. </p>
      <p>The PlayStation VR is Sony's own virtual reality headset to be used alongside a PS4 system. Released back in 2016, the headset offers one of the cheapest ways to experience high-quality virtual reality gameplay for PlayStation owners. Despite being a little old on the market now, the headset still rarely falls below $200 so this $199 price tag is a must-buy deal if you've ever fancied dipping your toe in PlayStation's virtual reality. </p>
      <p>The headset itself features a resolution of 1920 x RGB x 1080 on its 5.7-inch OLED display, with a 100-degree field of view. Plus, this PlayStation VR Black Friday deal also includes the PlayStation Camera which many bundles seem to neglect. If you're a PlayStation Plus member, you'll also receive free monthly games for your new headset. PSVR has been a little left out of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/best-2019-black-friday-deals">Black Friday deals</a> so far, so this is your chance to finally grab some savings.</p>
