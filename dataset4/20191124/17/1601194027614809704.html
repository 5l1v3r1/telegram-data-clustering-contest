      <p>Matthijs de Ligt is a doubt for Juventus' clash with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League after suffering a dislocated shoulder in Saturday's 3-1 win over Atalanta.</p>
      <p>Team-mate Douglas Costa will be sidelined for the Atletico game because of a thigh strain, Juventus indicated.</p>
      <p>Victory in Bergamo was the Bianconeri's fifth in a row in all competitions and they are top of Serie A, one point clear of Inter, but the loss of De Ligt on top of Costa's absence would be a blow to head coach Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>Centre-back De Ligt has started 10 of 13 domestic league games this season, with Giorgio Chiellini's knee injury thrusting the â‚¬75million signing from Ajax into the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Sarri will also monitor the fitness of forward Federico Bernardeschi, who was replaced after 26 minutes against Atalanta having suffered a bruised chest.</p>

      <p>A statement on the official Juventus website said: "Following diagnostic tests carried out this morning ... it emerged that Matthjis de Ligt suffered a dislocated right shoulder in yesterday's match and has now began the appropriate therapies and recovery.</p>
      <p>"Therapy and recovery also for Federico Bernardeschi, who suffered a bruise to the right hemithorax.</p>
      <p>"Douglas Costa suffered a low-grade lesion of the semitendinosus muscle of the right thigh and has started rehabilitation treatment."</p>
      <p>Juventus said that in winger Costa's case, it would take around 15 days for him to fully recover.</p>
