      <h1>Israel first democracy to expel Human Rights Watch official, director says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:33:38+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author">FRENCH PRESS AGENCY - AFP</a></address>
      <p>Israel is set to become the first democracy to expel a Human Rights Watch employee, its executive director Ken Roth said Sunday, denouncing the upcoming deportation of one of his staffers.</p>
      <p>U.S. citizen Omar Shakir, the New York-based rights group's director for Israel and the Palestinian territories, is to be deported from Israel on Monday over his alleged support of a boycott of the country.</p>
      <p>The expulsion, upheld by the supreme court, would make Shakir the first person to be expelled from the country under a controversial 2017 law allowing the deportation of foreigners who support a boycott of Israel, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>HRW denies Shakir supports a boycott of the Jewish state and accuses Israel of seeking to suppress criticism of policies towards Palestinians.</p>
      <p>"I cannot think of another democracy that has barred a Human Rights Watch researcher," Roth told the AFP in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Roth said countries including North Korea, Venezuela and Iran have expelled HRW researchers but no functioning democracy had taken such action.</p>
      <p>"I think it demonstrates the increasingly constrained nature of Israeli democracy," Roth added.</p>
      <p>He said Israel, despite having elections and a free press, tries "as much as it can" to silence efforts "spotlighting the human rights violations at the heart of the oppressive, discriminatory occupation (of Palestinian land).</p>
      <p>Shakir has been fighting a lengthy legal campaign against expulsion but earlier this month Israel's supreme court upheld the government's decision to deport him.</p>
      <p>Israel accuses him of being a supporter of the banned Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a broad-ranging boycott of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>Israel sees the movement as a strategic threat and accuses it of anti-Semitism â€“ a claim activists strongly deny.</p>
      <p>Supporters compare it to the economic isolation that helped bring down apartheid South Africa.</p>
      <p>"All those who work against Israel must know that we will not let them live or work here," Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The case against Shakir was initially based on statements he made in support of a boycott before taking up his post with HRW.</p>
      <p>The government case also highlighted work he has done since joining HRW, including criticizing Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>"Neither Human Rights Watch nor I as its representative have ever called for a boycott of Israel," Shakir told AFP.</p>
      <p>But he said that the organization did not restrict free speech, including the right to call for a boycott.</p>
      <p>"It is undeniable that boycotts around the world have led to changing unjust systems but Human Rights Watch doesn't take a position on them," he added.</p>
