        <b>GARISSA, Kenya, Nov 24 – Hosts Berlin FC reigned supreme as they saw off Al Ansar 2-0 to successfully defend the North Eastern Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom title in the first of the eight regions competition played on Sunday at the Technical Training College Grounds in Garissa.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Berlin FC, who pocketed Sh200,000 for lifting the title, will now once again for the second year running represent the North Eastern region in the National Finals set for June 2020 at the Bomu Stadium in Mombasa.</p>
      <p>After a goalless first half, Berlin FC opened the scoring in the 67th minute through Noor Osman with Abdalla Marro adding a second in the 88th minute to retain the title for the Garissa–based team.</p>
      <p>Last season, the two teams met in a tightly contested final where Berlin FC narrowly won via a penalty shootout.</p>
      <p>“We have been training hard in preparation for this tournament, rectifying the past mistakes we made in the National Finals and this time we promise to put up a better performance to enable us come home with the main cup. I have also been crowned the most valuable player and I would like to thank my coach and my team as it was a collective effort that earned me this title,” Berlin FC striker Abdalla Marro, who was the Top Scorer with three goals said.</p>

      <p>To reach the finals, Berlin FC beat Al Mumtaz from Modogashe 4-0 while Al Ansar from Wajir beat Admiral from Mandera 5-4 in post-match penalties.</p>
      <p>The tournament now moves to Mombasa, where the Coast regional finals will be held on the weekend of December 7 at Bomu Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Coast regional finals will also be accompanied by coaching clinics by La Liga coaches where they will be trained on how to build their skills to international standards.</p>
      <p>Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom aims to develop grassroots football and providing a platform where gifted players will have an opportunity to be scouted and play for the National team as well as the top tier local and international teams.</p>
      <p>Once all regional finals are played, an all-Star team comprising of 16 girls and 16 boys will be selected to attend a 10-day training camp in Spain.</p>
      <p>The teams will play friendly matches against top Spanish La Liga Football Academies after which the players will rejoin their teams for the National finals where Sh1 million is at stake for the winner.</p>
