      <h1>Texas A&amp;M Safety Fires Back At LSU Ahead Of Saturday’s Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:53:24+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>When LSU takes on Texas A&amp;M next weekend, they will not only be looking to cap off a undefeated regular season, they’ll be looking to avenge a loss that has stuck with them for a year.</p>
      <p>In the 2018 regular season finale, the Aggies outlasted LSU in a 74-72 seven-overtime marathon. It was Texas A&amp;M’s first win over the Tigers since joining the SEC in 2012.</p>
      <p>Heading into this year’s game, LSU players and <a href="https://247sports.com/college/lsu/Article/Ed-Orgeron-its-on-against-Texas-AM-LSU-football-game-2019-Jimbo-Fisher-139126535/">coaches alike</a> aren’t exactly hiding that this matchup has some added incentive to it. Meanwhile, one of A&amp;M’s defensive starters is claiming just the opposite.</p>
      <p>A&amp;M safety Leon O’Neal Jr. tried to downplay the significance of facing the Tigers next weekend.</p>
      <p>“Truth is we don’t care about LSU we care about us everything else is just window dressing …. y’all keep that hype s–t over there. We will be ready when its time,” O’Neal tweeted.</p>

      <p>Considering a win over LSU in Baton Rouge would give the Tigers’ their only regular season blemish, we think O’Neal is bluffing a little bit here. Both sides want this game, badly.</p>
      <p>LSU and Texas A&amp;M will meet in primetime Saturday night at 7 p.m. ET from Tiger Stadium. LSU has already clinched the SEC West title and a berth in the conference championship game.</p>
