      <h3>SUSPENSIONS</h3>
      <p>Harlee Dean will serve the final match of his three game ban.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Details</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blues midfielder went down in pain during the second half of the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-vs-leeds-united-16084035">1-0 win against Leeds</a> in April and had to be taken off the pitch on a stretcher.</p>
      <p>Then boss Garry Monk admitted afterwards that it didn’t look good and a scan confirmed Kieftenbeld would be <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-suffer-devastating-blow-16099024">set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines.</a></p>
      <p>The Dutchman damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee - he might not be back until Christmas.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Birmingham City 1 Leeds United 0 - Saturday, April 6</p>
      <p><b>What Clotet said:</b> "From the reports that I have we are expecting him to try to join us in training for January or February, we are not putting much pressure on it because every knee is different but I do know he is doing very well in his recovery and probably the timing will be around that.</p>
      <p>“Normally it’s around six to eight months to be on the grass so he is going to hit that because he is a very good pro and he has done everything by the book with his knee. He is on the right track.”</p>
      <p><b>Potential return date:</b> New Year</p>
      <h3>Gary Gardner</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Injury</b>
      </p>
      <p>Knee</p>
      <p>
        <b>Details</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gary Gardner has undergone a ‘minor operation’ on a knee injury that will keep him out until at least after the international break.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> midfielder hurt himself as he took a late free kick in the 1-0 defeat at Leeds and has missed every game since.</p>
      <p><b>Last match: </b>Leeds United 1-0 Birmingham City - October 19</p>
      <p><b>What Clotet said: </b>Clotet was asked if Gardner will be available the Huddersfield game: “I don’t know if that will be a lot of pressure for him, they said four to six weeks, I was speaking to him last week, he looks much better, he looks fine and stable and has been doing a lot of work.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to put that pressure on him to be available, it needs to be when it is sorted, but it’s going very well – so possibly.”</p>
      <p><b>Potential return date: </b>Soon</p>
