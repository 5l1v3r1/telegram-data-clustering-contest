      <p>Manager Martin Baird made four changes, with Conah Bishop, Carnan Dawson, Djay Delacruz and Jamie Thomas all coming into the starting 11.</p>
      <p>Thomas had the first chance of note in the 14th minute, running into the box only to see his effort saved and cleared.</p>
      <p>Blackpool went even closer three minutes later, when McClean’s strike was cleared off the line.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until the 35th minute that the visitors from Huddersfield troubled the home defence and even then the shot was easily saved by Alex Cameron.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later AFC took the lead, when an inch-perfect Jamie Milligan corner was headed in by Simmons.</p>
      <p>The hosts reached half-time untroubled but had a let-off shortly after the restart, when Shelley struck a post following a cross from the right.</p>
      <p>Mechs heeded the warning immediately as Thomas hit the side-netting, then on 53 minutes they doubled their lead.</p>
      <p>The ball found McClean free in the box and he cut inside to score.</p>
      <p>Baird’s men continued to attack as Bishop charged into the box but fired over.</p>
      <p>Shelley pulled one back on 79 minutes with a great strike from outside the box by Alex O’Keefe.</p>
      <p>But the two-goal cushion was restored four minutes later, when Ryan Charnley’s pass picked out substitute Billy McKenna and he scored with a powerful strike.</p>
      <p>The win lifts Blackpool to sixth and they could climb further with victory at struggling AFC Darwen on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Blackpool: Cameron, Bishop, Dawson, Vaughan, Penswick, Fishwick, Simmons (McKenna 79), Delacruz, Thomas (Charnley 72), Milligan, McClean (Buchan 61).</p>
