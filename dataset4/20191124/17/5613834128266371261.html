      <p>Publishers 1C Entertainment and 3D Realms, along with developer KillPixel, have finally given retro-inspired first-person shooter fans a treat by releasing <b><i>WRATH: Aeon of Ruin</i></b> to Steam Early Access. The game, which was scheduled to be out this past summer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1000410/WRATH_Aeon_of_Ruin/">on Steam</a>, will also be out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch early next year. You can grab the game on Steam now for $24.99 USD, with a 5% off launch discount. An additional 10% discount is available if you snag the bundle with <i>WRATH: Aeon of Ruin</i> and <b><i>Ion Fury</i></b>.</p>
      <p>The story for <i>WRATH</i> has you as Outlander. Once adrift upon the Ageless Sea, you now find yourself on the shores of a dying world. From the consuming darkness emerges a figure cloaked in white, the Shepherd of Wayward Souls, who burdens you with the task of hunting down the remaining Guardians of the Old World. You must journey into the vast gloom to explore ancient ruins, discover forgotten secrets and battle the horrors that lurk within.</p>
