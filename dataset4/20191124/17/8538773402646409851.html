      <p>CLEVELAND -- Though Cleveland was set to play the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> on Sunday, Browns fans still had the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> -- and last week's melee -- on the mind.</p>
      <p>Cleveland tailgaters even had a <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> piñata, and blindfolded fans tried to hit the Steelers quarterback dummy with a Pittsburgh helmet, according to video from Cleveland.com.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive end Myles Garrett was suspended for the season for ripping off and swinging Rudolph's helmet into his head in the closing seconds of Cleveland's 21-7 victory Nov. 14. During his appeal with the NFL, Garrett accused Rudolph of inciting him with a racial slur, which Rudolph has denied through his agent.</p>
      <p>Thursday night, Garrett stood by his claim in a tweet, which was followed by a statement from general manager John Dorsey, noting Garrett's "unquestionable integrity."</p>
      <p>Before Sunday's game with the Dolphins, Browns owner Dee Haslam was photographed with Garrett's No. 95 on her cap in a show of support.</p>

      <p>Rudolph's day only got worse as he was benched in the Steelers' game at <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
      <p>Cleveland travels to Pittsburgh next weekend.</p>
