      <h2>Legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was seen talking to Ed Woodward in the stands of Bramall Lane as the Red Devils struggled in the first half against Sheffield United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:49:13+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson and Ed Woodward were pictured engaged in what appeared to be a heated debate as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> struggled in the first half against Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>The legendary Manchester United manager and the club's executive vice-chairman watched the action from the stands of Bramall Lane this weekend.</p>
      <p>Ferguson regularly travels around the country to watch his beloved United in action, and has witnessed first hand their slow decline since he stepped down as boss in 2013.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Ferguson and Woodward were snapped mid-conversation and appeared animated as they presumably talked about the problems at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The pair chatted for a few minutes, with Woodward seen passionately getting his words across and using his hands to illustrate his point.</p>
      <p>It is not known exactly what the duo discussed as United struggled to shine on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Red Devils side were initially put to the sword by the Blades as the newly-promoted club took the lead in the first half through John Fleck.</p>

      <p>Phil Jones was a fault in the build-up to the goal and was hooked at the break, with Solskjaer going for broke in replacing the defender with Jesse Lingard.</p>
      <p>But the switch did little to spur the Red Devils on, and it wasn't long before Sheffield United doubled their lead through Lys Mousset.</p>
      <p>Twenty minutes before the end Manchester United youngster Brandon Williams smashed home a loose ball in the Blades box to reduce the deficit.</p>
      <p>Mason Greenwood then levelled the scores five minutes later before Marcus Rashford completed the comeback 120 seconds after that.</p>

      <p>But it was the home side who had the final say, with Oli McBurnie equalising for the Blades in the 90th minutes.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer has been under some pressure this season as he has struggled to improve things at Manchester United since replacing Jose Mourinho in 2018.</p>
      <p>Former managerial target Mauricio Pochettino has recently become available after being sacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> after five years in charge of the north London club.</p>
      <p>But United's interest in the Argentine has cooled in recent months, despite calls from fans to make him the next Red Devils boss.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, former Red Devils boss Mourinho has replaced Pochettino at Spurs.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was victorious in his first game in charge of Tottenham on Saturday, as Spurs ran out 3-2 winners over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> at London Stadium.</p>
      <p>After the match the Portuguese said: "It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness. They did it.</p>

      <p>"I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
      <p>"But it was probably closer to a 4-0 than 3-1. I think my players paid the price of a very difficult week. International break, change of manager, new guy, different training sessions."</p>
