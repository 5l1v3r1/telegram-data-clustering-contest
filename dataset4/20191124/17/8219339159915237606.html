      <p>Black Friday week delivers a <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/apple-10-ipad-deals/">new all-time low on Apple’s 10.2-inch iPad</a> alongside <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/black-friday-macbook-deals/">up to $299 off various MacBook models</a>.

      <h3>10.2-inch iPad gets anticipated Black Friday deal</h3>
      <p>Staples offers <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/apple-10-ipad-deals/">Apple’s 10.2-inch iPad WI-FI 32GB for <b>$249 shipped</b></a>. That’s a new all-time low price and the expected Black Friday going rate. <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/24/apple-10-ipad-deals/">Cellular configurations are also being discounted by<b> $49</b></a> over at Amazon as well. It’s less clear at this point if these models will be on sale for <a href="https://9to5toys.com/guides/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday</a>, so this may be as good as it gets. With a larger 10.2-inch display, <a href="https://amzn.to/34AB4pg">Apple Pencil</a> support, and compatibility with smart connector accessories, this is arguably one of the most compelling iPads in Apple’s stable currently. Includes an A10 Fusion chip, 8MP camera, and support for 1080p HD recording.
