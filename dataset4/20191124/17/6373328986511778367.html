      <p>The 50-year-old has since been charged with importing class A drugs and has been remanded in custody until he appears before Brighton Magistrates’ Court on Monday, November 25.</p>
      <p>Inside the lorry, Border Force officers found 97 packages stashed among the frozen fish – with each one containing around a kilogram of cocaine.</p>
      <p>According to the National Crime Agency (NCA), the drugs – which were taken away for further analysis following the haul – could have been sold at street level for around £10 million.</p>

      <p>An NCA spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7720107/Van-driver-caught-10million-worth-cocaine-hidden-batch-FROZEN-FISH.html"><i>MailOnline</i></a>: ‘If cut and sold at street level it is likely the haul would have had a potential value of around £10 million.’</p>

      <p>Paul Morris, a NCA senior investigating officer, also told the publication that large hauls like these a key part of the job.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Morris explained: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>NCA officers are working alongside Border Force, Sussex Police, Thames Valley Police and the South East regional organised crime unit to investigate this seizure and the circumstances around it.<br/><br/>Working with partners we are determined to do all we can to disrupt the organised crime groups involved in the large-scale importation of class A drugs which fuel serious violence and impact some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Making seizures like this is an important part of that work.</blockquote>
      <p>Drug seizures are an essential part of border control. If the police don’t do it, we’ll need to turn to <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/animals/feral-hogs-steal-22000-worth-of-cocaine-from-drug-trafficking-ring/">feral hogs</a>, who just recently stole a stash of cocaine worth $22,000 (£17,000) hidden in a forest.</p>

      <p>In August this year, Germany came across the single largest haul of cocaine in the country’s history, finding 221 bags full of the stuff in a shipping container – <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/germanys-biggest-stash-of-cocaine-worth-e1000000000-found/">worth a whopping €1,000,000</a>.</p>
      <p>In September this year, nearly 1.3 tons of heroin with a street value of more than £120 million were found in <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/police-discover-1-3-tons-of-heroin-worth-120-million-in-record-haul/">Britain’s biggest ever seizure of the drug,</a> hidden among towels and bathrobes.</p>
      <p>NCA officers from the MV Gibraltar recovered the narcotics – after receiving a tip-off – from a container ship after it docked at Felixstowe in Suffolk.</p>
