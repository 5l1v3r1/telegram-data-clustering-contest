      <p>Cleveland Browns fans are taking the fight between Myles Garrett and Mason Rudolph to hilarious levels.</p>
      <p>Before the team was slated to face off against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, the fan base got a Mason Rudolph pinata, a Steelers helmet, and blindfolded a guy as he tried to hit it.</p>

      <p>The Browns DE is now suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season and the postseason if the team makes it that far. He should be ready to go by 2020.</p>
      <p>Rudolph received a $50K fine for his actions during the fight.</p>
