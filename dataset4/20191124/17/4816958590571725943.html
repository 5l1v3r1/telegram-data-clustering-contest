      <p>REGGIO EMILIA — Substitute Felipe Caicedo scored a stoppage-time goal as Lazio claimed a fifth successive Serie A win by beating lowly Sassuolo 2-1 away on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Ecuadorean, who came on in the 79th minute, exchanged passes with Luis Alberto and held off a challenge from two defenders before turning to beat Andrea Consigli in the 91st minute of a rain-soaked match.</p>
      <p>The win kept Lazio third in Serie A with 27 points from 13 games, two ahead of neighbors AS Roma and eight behind leaders Juventus.</p>
      <p>Serie A’s leading scorer Ciro Immobile grabbed his 15th league goal of the season to give Lazio the lead in the 34th minute when he ran onto a through ball and scored with a shot which deflected past Consigli.</p>
      <p>Francesco Caputo equalized for Sassuolo when he turned the ball in at the far post from a corner with the last kick of the first half.</p>
      <p>“Our first-half performance was excellent and we could have ended it a couple of goals in front,” said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi. “We didn’t repeat it in the second half but we knew how to suffer together. We deserved the win.”</p>
      <p>Bologna left it even later as Blerim Dzemaili scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to give them a 2-2 draw at home to Parma.</p>
      <p>Dejan Kulusevski put Parma ahead with a curling shot in the 17th minute and veteran Rodrigo Palacio headed Bologna level five minutes before halftime.</p>
      <p>Simone Iacoponi put eighth-placed Parma back in front with a breakaway goal in the 71st minute but Bologna grabbed a point at the death when Dzemaili volleyed home from a corner.</p>
      <p>Fiorentina’s lackluster season continued with a 1-0 defeat at Verona in a midtable clash as Samuel Di Carmine scored the winner in the 66th minute. The win lifted Verona above Fiorentina to ninth with 18 points.</p>
