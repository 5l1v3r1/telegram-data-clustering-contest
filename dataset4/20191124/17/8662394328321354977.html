      <p>After a decade-long search, Canberra's Ahmadiyya Muslim community is a step closer to having their own purpose-built mosque, with a development application lodged for a site in Narrabundah.</p>
      <p>The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association, who preach "love for all, hatred for none", has submitted an application to build a 703-square-metre place of worship, along with a single dwelling and a 70-space carpark.</p>

      <p>It is expected to cost $1,288,000 with plans designed by AMC Architecture. A two-storey mosque will accommodate 300 worshipers and an Imam's residence.</p>
      <p>The 4000-square metre block neighbours the Spanish-Australian Club, the Best Western hotel and the Narrabundah ball park. It is zoned CZ6 for leisure and accommodation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6033730/government-sells-ahmadiyya-muslims-narrabundah-land-for-mosque/">The Ahmadiyya Association was offered the block by the ACT government in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>Ahmadiyya Muslim Association ACT director of community outreach, Ahmed Munir said it was the "greatest feeling" to secure the site.</p>
      <p>"It was the greatest feeling a community could have, because eventually we were going to get that purpose-built mosque, a lot of people thought it might have been too difficult to get so it was a fantastic feeling," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Munir said Canberra's Ahmadi community has searched for a land for decade.</p>
      <p>"The community had been looking for a block of land to build a mosque and they have been in discussions and negotiations with the government for a long time," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are a community organisation and we obviously needed the direct sale process to happen for us to get a block of land."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6000612/work-on-narrabundah-mosque-could-start-next-year/">Construction of the mosque was intended to start this year</a>, but Mr Munir said it was the "usual delays" that held up the process.</p>
      <p>In 2014, a mosque was proposed to be built near the Rivett shops but residents and shop owners expressed concerns and the Ahmadiyya Association abandoned those plans.</p>
      <p>"A block of land in Rivett was identified originally, but looking at a number of factors we sort of pulled ourselves out because of where it was located and we were gauging some uneasiness with the shop owners," said Mr Munir.</p>
      <p>A site in Hume was then identified, but the ACT government later deemed the site unsuitable.</p>
      <p>The Canberra Ahmadi community has worshiped out of temporary locations with prayer services currently held from a site in Fyshwick. Prior to that, they were based in the Griffin Centre in the city.</p>
      <p>There are about 150 members in Canberra, with about 6000 members across Australia. There are only two purpose-built Ahmadiyya mosques in Australia, in NSW and Queensland.</p>
      <p>"We're very lucky we have been blessed with a place here in the capital of the country," said Mr Munir.</p>
      <p>The Ahmadiyya movement was founded in 1889, and is based on the teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmah who is accepted as a messiah in the denomination. They have faced persecution overseas, in Pakistan Ahmadi Muslims are prohibited by law.</p>
      <p>While the mosque has not yet been built, the world head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad gave the name to the Narrabundah mosque, Masjid Bait-ul-Hadi, meaning 'house of the guider', or 'the one who guides'.</p>
      <p>The direct sale of the block will be concluded upon development application approval.</p>
