      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:17:05+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>Prince William is 'not a huge fan' of his uncle Prince Andrew and even helped him get 'sacked' from his royal role, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has been accused of 'hoodwinking' the Queen by not warning her he was about to discuss the scandal at length in a car crash BBC interview which aired last weekend.</p>
      <p>Days after the disastrous interview was aired Prince Andrew, 59, said he was stepping back from his royal duties.</p>
      <p>His performance in the interview has been heavily criticized and massively overshadowed Prince Charles' trip to New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Cambridge was unhappy with his uncle's behaviour and decided his removal from public life was 'the right thing to do', a source is reported to have told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/subscribe/?ILC=INT-TNL_The_Times-Conversion_Page-Homepage-2016_01_13-333">The Sunday Times</a>.</p>

      <p>Another said the dad-of-three and second in line to the throne had spoken to the Queen and Prince Charles about Andrew's future, adding: "William is becoming more and more involved in decisions about the institution [monarchy] and he's not a huge fan of his uncle Andrew."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7719587/Prince-William-not-huge-fan-uncle-Prince-Andrew.html">The Mail on Sunday</a> has reported that the Duke of York's former wife Sarah Ferguson and daughter Princess Beatrice were key figures pressing him to go ahead with the Newsnight interview.</p>
      <p>The paper claims Fergie wanted speculation about her ex-husband's friendship with the convicted paedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein to be put to bed before Beatrice's wedding next year.</p>

      <p>Fergie reportedly stayed away from meetings with the Newsnight team and was abroad when details of the interview were being finalised.</p>
      <p>However, Beatrice, the couple's eldest daughter, was present along with Andrew's then-private secretary Amanda Thirsk.</p>
      <p>Beatrice, 31, and Andrew met Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis and the programme's deputy editor, Stewart Maclean, at Buckingham Palace three days before filming to discuss the scope of the interview.</p>

      <p>The Prince is even reported to have thought that when the interview was recorded he thought it had gone well.</p>
      <p>The Prince has confirmed to friends in recent days that his former wife had backed his participation in the programme.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Beatrice, with the benefit of hindsight, is now mortified that she did not do more to stop the interview going ahead, not least as it casts an even greater shadow over her forthcoming wedding.</p>
      <p>It also leaves her and younger sister Eugenie in a difficult position when it comes to their future roles as working princesses.</p>

      <p>Beleaguered Andrew also faces the prospect of Virginia Giuffre - an alleged Jeffrey Epstein victim who claims she had under-age sex with the duke, which he strenuously denies - being interviewed on BBC's Panorama programme early in December.</p>
      <p>The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) was among a number of organisations which announced on Friday they would no longer be involved with Andrew, following the controversy around his friendship with convicted sex offender Epstein.</p>
      <p>In a statement, an RPO spokesman said: "Following HRH the Duke of York's announcement that he will be stepping back from public life, management representatives of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) met with Prince Andrew's office on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"At a subsequent meeting of the RPO board, it was decided that the orchestra should part company with its patron, with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>"The RPO would like to express its gratitude to His Royal Highness for his support of the orchestra over the past 15 years."</p>
