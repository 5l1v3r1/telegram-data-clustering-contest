      <p> “<i>Esteban had been with us for some time. We found ourselves in a situation last year where we didn’t have a seat to offer him. He learned a lot. He could have just watched Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, but instead, he’s done a lot of simulators and learned a lot</i>," Wolff was quoted by thejudge13.com. </p>
      <p> “<i>Overall he is much more mature. Esteban is a driver who deserves to be in a Mercedes and who deserves to be in a very good car. But I believe that Renault’s offer, which is a factory team, could not be refused</i>.</p>

      <p> “<i>It is something good for him and his development. And I think there are also risks when you go back to Mercedes against a Lewis Hamilton, in a team that is fighting for the world championship. For that reason, I believe that for him, Renault is the ideal solution</i>.</p>
