      <h1>Tennessee QB Jarrett Guarantano: I received death threats amid struggles</h1>

      <p>Tennessee Volunteers quarterback Jarrett Guarantano says that amid his struggles earlier this season he received death threats from angry fans, who also went after Guarantano’s sister.</p>
      <p>“There were so many guys that were there for me throughout the death threats, the mean messages to the sister,” Guarantano <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq7Tywe4VOQ&amp;feature=emb_title">said Saturday</a> after leading Tennessee to a win over Missouri, bringing the Vols to 6-5. “They were all there for me and it really meant a lot. There were some hectic times for me and they were there for me every step of the way.”</p>
      <p>Guarantano, a redshirt junior who starred for Bergen Catholic H.S., lost his starting job earlier this season as Tennessee got out to a 1-4 start. As the starter on Saturday, Guarantano completed 23 of 40 passes for 415 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions in helping the Vols become bowl eligible.</p>
      <p>“This was probably my last opportunity, to be honest,” said Guarantano, who plans to remain with the program for his senior year. “For me to be able to come out and start and get this opportunity again, I didn’t have any option but to come out here and try to play my best ball. It just felt good being able to start again.”</p>
