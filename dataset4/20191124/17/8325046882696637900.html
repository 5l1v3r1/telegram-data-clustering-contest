      <p>“Terminator: Dark Fate” reunited James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, and Arnold Schwarzenegger to little fanfare. Since debuting in theaters earlier this month, “Dark Fate” has made just $235 million worldwide off of a $185 million production budget, and it will likely top out in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>It’s a disappointing result considering it received far better reviews than the last installment in the long-running franchise, 2015’s “Terminator Genisys,” but could leave theaters as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/terminator-dark-fate-box-office-flop-could-mean-franchise-end-2019-11">the lowest-grossing sequel in the series</a>. “Genisys” earned $440 million worldwide and received an abysmal 27% Rotten Tomatoes critic score compared to “Dark Fate’s” 71%. In fact, it’s the best reviewed “Terminator” sequel since 1991’s “Terminator 2: Judgement Day.”</p>
      <p>The “Dark Fate” director, Tim Miller, opened up about the movie’s disappointing box office on Friday <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/the-business/terminator-dark-fate-director-on-the-bumpy-road-to-a-box-office-bomb/tim-miller-on-terminator-box-office-woes-im-processing-but-im-very-proud-of-the-movie">in a KCRW interview with Kim Masters</a>, who is the editor-at-large of <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/why-terminator-dark-fate-director-wont-work-james-cameron-again-1257322">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure we could write a book on why it didn’t work,” Miller said. “I’m still not sure and I’m processing, but I’m very proud of the movie.”</p>
      <p>Jeff Bock, the Exhibitor Relations senior box-office analyst, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/terminator-dark-fate-box-office-flop-could-mean-franchise-end-2019-11">told Business Insider</a> after “Dark Fate’s” sluggish opening weekend at the box office that audiences have “had enough” of the “Terminator” franchise after a series of lackluster sequels. Miller told Masters that these are things he “can’t control.”</p>
      <p>“The things they seemed to hate the most about the movie, were things I can’t control,” Miller said. “I can’t control if you didn’t like Genisys or you felt betrayed by Terminator 4. I can’t help that.”</p>
      <p>Miller also acknowledged that he was at odds with Cameron on some creative choices. Cameron, who directed the first two “Terminator” movies, returned to the franchise as a producer on “Dark Fate.” Miller said that he felt an obligation “to fight” for his vision because “that is what the director is supposed to do.”</p>
      <p>Miller explained one of those argument’s with Cameron in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/terminator-dark-fate-director-time-travel-fight-with-james-cameron-2019-11">an interview with Business Insider</a> earlier this month. Miller said that the two disagreed on some of the time-travel elements in the movie, and that Miller eventually got his way because Cameron’s ideas wouldn’t have made sense to the plot.</p>
      <p>Miller told Masters that he likely wouldn’t work with Cameron again.</p>
      <p>“It has nothing to do with whatever trauma I have from the experience,” Miller said. “It’s more that I just don’t want to be in a situation again where I don’t have the control to do what I think is right.”</p>
      <p>Cameron told Deadline in August that “Dark Fate” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/james-cameron-terminator-trilogy-depends-on-dark-fate-box-office-2019-8">could launch a new “Terminator” trilogy</a> if it performed well at the box office. With that in mind, “Dark Fate” could be the last “Terminator” movie for a long time.</p>
