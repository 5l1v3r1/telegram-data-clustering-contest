      <h1>Could One-Punch Man's Saitama Beat Superman? (Spoiler: Yes, But Here's Why)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:11:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Stone</a></address>
      <p>As the strongest superhero in the DC Universe, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/superman/">Superman</a>'s sheer levels of power are unrivaled in the comic book world. The Last Son of Krypton has been depicted as being able to move planets with his bare hands, withstand the reality-warping intensity of being caught within a singularity and once punch Darkseid with so much raw strength that it seemed as if all of time had stopped for an instant. With a dazzling array of superpowers and such vast reservoirs of endurance and strength, Superman truly is the most powerful superhero in comics...from North America.</p>
      <p>Saitama, the star of popular manga/anime franchise <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/one-punch-man/"><i>One-Punch Man</i></a>, has lived up to the eponymous premise consistently over the course of the story and subsequent media adaptations. Often without putting in much effort at all, he dispatches each of his opponents with a single blow. Saitama's comically overpowered skillset forms the basis for the entire franchise: the unassuming superhero has spent his entire career searching for an opponent that can withstand more than one punch against him in combat. The put-upon figure isn't even searching for a opponent that can stand toe-to-toe with him in battle like Dragon Ball's Goku; Saitama just wants to find someone that can endure more than a punch to make life just a little bit more interesting.</p>

      <p>And the manga franchise has certainly had its fair share of challengers rise to take up Saitama on the offer: Season 1 pit Saitama against an increasingly powerful host of criminals, monsters and invading aliens, all unable to live up to the hero's hopes. Saitama had grown so desperate by Season 2 that he completely ignored escalating threats to humanity to enter a martial arts tournament where he would eliminate opponents by the sheer force of wind generated by his movements; some opponents going down decisively without him landing a physical blow at all. Before the season even ended and left him frustrated by his inability to find a worthy opponent, Saitama <a href="https://www.cbr.com/one-punch-man-saitama-greatest-enemy/">underwent an existential crisis</a> so bad he contemplated leaving his superhero career behind altogether.</p>
      <p>By contrast, Superman has certainly used his immense array of abilities and raw power to save the day countless times but he's also been dunked on more times than the 1992 Dallas Mavericks. The hero was famously been beaten to death by Doomsday, but he's also been physically throttled by longtime villains Brainiac, Mongul, Darkseid, General Zod, Imperiex, Lex Luthor in a knockoff Iron Man suit...the list goes on. Super Friends Batman, Wonder Woman and Shazam have knocked around the Man of Tomorrow on multiple occasion, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/flash-forward-wally-west-takes-down-justice-league/">Wally West just beat an alternate Superman</a> without having a single finger laid on him and Green Lantern John Stewart once took out the Man of Steel with a glorified eye-poke.</p>

      <p>Beating up Superman has virtually become a rite of passage in the DCU , with heroes' true potential shown by having them stunt on Kal-El. The feat proves a hero is worthy of playing in the big leagues at Clark Kent's continued expense, it's practically a requirement to join the Justice League at this point. Even the seemingly powerless mercenary <a href="https://www.cbr.com/superman-vs-deathstroke-who-won/">Deathstroke has outmatched Superman</a> during both the New 52 and DC Rebirth eras, and Rebirth opened with Aquaman and Mera spending the majority of an issue just beating up Superman.</p>
      <p>In addition to his trademark power punches, Saitama can take a blow on the chin from any opponent far better than the Man of Steel. He has had the full arsenal of killer robots and invading alien fleets unleashed upon him and shrugged it all off without suffering so much as even a scratch. While Superman is used as a Kryptonian punching bag to show off how powerful new heroes and villains are, Saitama's supporting cast of fellow heroes are pit against new foes to show how strong Saitama's latest opponent is before he delivers a killer punchline. It often results in any hapless monster, robot or alien being viscerally blown apart into smithereens. The upcoming <i>One-Punch Man</i> fighting game has to justify opponents even having a chance of being able to defeat Saitama with the claim that the incarnation of the character they fight is an <a href="https://www.cbr.com/one-punch-man-video-game-trailer-fair-fight/">imagined, dream opponent</a> rather than the real thing.</p>
      <p>Superman is one of the greatest, most inspiring comic book characters ever created; the modern superhero genre doesn't exist without him and, with it, the inspiration to create One-Punch Man in the first place. But in an actual knockdown, drag-out fight between the two immensely strong characters? Superman would simply be another entry in a long list of disappointments for Saitama, likely exploded into Kryptonian mist after enduring a single punch from his bald counterpart.</p>
