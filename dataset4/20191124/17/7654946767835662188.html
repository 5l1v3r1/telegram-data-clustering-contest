      <h1>Emotional funeral held for NYPD cop who died in FDR crash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:36:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Israel Salas-Rodriguez and Lia Eustachewich</a></address>
      <p>The father of the NYPD officer killed after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/shocking-video-shows-moment-car-driven-by-nypd-officer-garman-chen-crashes-on-fdr-drive/">crashing his speeding car</a> on the FDR Drive cried his eyes out Sunday morning as he said goodbye to his son one last time.</p>
      <p>The emotional scene played out under gray skies and a light drizzle at Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn, where dozens of uniformed NYPD officers lined up to pay their respects to Garman Chen.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old officer of three years was off duty when he slammed his black 2016 Lexus into a concrete barrier last weekend on the FDR Drive, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/nypd-officer-dead-2-critically-injured-in-deadly-crash-on-fdr-sources/">killing himself and seriously injuring two passengers.</a></p>
      <p>With grief etched on his face, Chen’s father wept outside the Dyker Heights funeral home as his son’s American flag-draped casket was hauled out and placed in a hearse. The father was consoled by other families as he and a female relative were presented with the neatly folded flag.</p>
      <p>Just before the family drove off with a police escort, the dad stepped out of the vehicle and bowed before the row of NYPD officers still in formation.</p>
      <p>Faith Davis, who works at the 76th Precinct as an administrative assistant, called Chen a “good soul.”</p>
      <p>“He’s going to be missed in the precinct,” said Davis, 28. “He was funny, he made jokes of everything, which gave light to every situation that happened in the precinct. Really good guy, everybody liked him.</p>
      <p>Other family members and friends declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The two passengers — first-year FDNY firefighter Kenneth Larkin and his girlfriend Amanda Remy, both 25, — were thrown from the Lexus in the early-morning crash. Larkin suffered a broken arm and leg and serious head injuries, while Remy’s foot was severed.</p>
