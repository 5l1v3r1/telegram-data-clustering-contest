      <p>JERUSALEM: Israel is set to become the first democracy to expel a Human Rights Watch employee, its executive director Ken Roth said Sunday, denouncing the upcoming deportation of one of his staffers.<br/>US citizen Omar Shakir, the New York-based rights group’s director for Israel and the Palestinian territories, is to be deported from Israel on Monday over his alleged support of a boycott of the country.<br/>The expulsion, upheld by the supreme court, would make Shakir the first person to be expelled from the country under a controversial 2017 law allowing the deportation of foreigners who support a boycott of Israel, according to authorities.<br/>HRW denies Shakir supports a boycott of the Jewish state and accuses Israel of seeking to suppress criticism of policies toward Palestinians.<br/>“I cannot think of another democracy that has barred a Human Rights Watch researcher,” Roth told AFP in Jerusalem.<br/>Roth said countries including North Korea, Venezuela and Iran have expelled HRW researchers but no functioning democracy had taken such action.<br/>“I think it demonstrates the increasingly constrained nature of Israeli democracy,” Roth added.<br/>He said Israel, despite having elections and a free press, tries “as much as it can” to silence efforts “spotlighting the human rights violations at the heart of the oppressive, discriminatory occupation (of Palestinian land).<br/>Shakir has been fighting a lengthy legal campaign against expulsion but earlier this month Israel’s supreme court upheld the government’s decision to deport him.<br/>Israel accuses him of being a supporter of the banned Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a broad-ranging boycott of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.<br/>Israel sees the movement as a strategic threat and accuses it of anti-Semitism — a claim activists strongly deny.<br/>Supporters compare it to the economic isolation that helped bring down apartheid South Africa.<br/>“All those who work against Israel must know that we will not let them live or work here,” Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said earlier this month.<br/>The case against Shakir was initially based on statements he made in support of a boycott before taking up his post with HRW.<br/>The government case also highlighted work he has done since joining HRW, including criticizing Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.<br/>“Neither Human Rights Watch nor I as its representative have ever called for a boycott of Israel,” Shakir told AFP.<br/>But he said that the organization did not restrict free speech, including the right to call for a boycott.<br/>“It is undeniable that boycotts around the world have led to changing unjust systems but Human Rights Watch doesn’t take a position on them,” he added.</p>
