      <p>It looks like Keanu Taylor will survive Phil Mitchell's revenge at Christmas in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a>.</p>
      <p>Fans know mechanic <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-confirms-sharon-and-louise-will-give-birth-at-christmas/">Keanu has got both Phil's daughter Louise and wife Sharon pregnant</a> - and the secret is set to explode at Christmas.</p>
      <p>They have been left fearing Keanu will be murdered at the end of the storyline after it was revealed actor Danny Walters had quit the soap.</p>
      <p>And now some filming pictures released on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/eastenders-spoilers-keanu-dies-christmas-exit-leaving-pictures-11210135/">Metro.co.uk</a> appear to show a surprisingly happy ending for the character.</p>

      <p>He can be seen running for a plane at an airport after saying an emotional goodbye to his mum Karen.</p>
      <p>It has not yet been revealed whether these are Danny's final scenes or whether he is drawn back to Walford and leaves another way.</p>
      <p>Previous reports claimed Martin Fowler will shoot Keanu in a tense showdown with Linda Carter present as a hostage.</p>
      <p>Fans speculated that Martin would come under the control of Phil after he remembers what really happened to him the night he was attacked and blackmail him, like Ben did.</p>

      <p>But they think that when Phil orders Martin to kill Keanu, he will double-cross him and fake it so Keanu has time to escape.</p>
      <p>Actor Danny <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">announced he had quit as Keanu</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement: "It has been a joy to play Keanu Taylor for the last two and a half years.</p>
      <p>"I have been blessed to work with the most fantastic creative team. I will miss them and my fellow actors immensely.</p>
      <p>"EastEnders will always hold a special place in my heart and I will continue to be an avid fan."</p>
      <p>EastEnders' executive producer Jon Sen added: "Keanu's story is set to come to a dramatic and blistering conclusion in the near future as one of the best kept secrets on the Square is finally revealed with devastating consequences."</p>
