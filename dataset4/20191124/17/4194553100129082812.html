      <h1>Liverpoolâ€™s potential FIFA Club World Cup opponents confirmed after Al-Hilal triumph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:56:34+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool now know every club they could face in the FIFA Club World Cup, following Al-Hilalâ€™s triumph in the AFC Champions League.</p>
      <p>So now thatâ€™s the last team confirmed to join us, Al-Sadd, Flamengo, Monterrey, Esperance Sportive de Tunis, Hienghene Sport in Qatar before the end of this year.</p>
      <blockquote>The Reds could very well be lining up against Flamengo in the final of the FIFA Club World Cup, in what would be a rematch of the 1981 Intercontinental Cup in which we were slapped 3-0 ðŸ˜¬ <a href="https://t.co/KLqJsww5I9">pic.twitter.com/KLqJsww5I9<br/></a>â€” Empire of the Kop (@empireofthekop) <a href="https://twitter.com/empireofthekop/status/1198598401509773315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2019</a></blockquote>

      <p>Naturally, the Reds are being tipped to win the whole thing, but not opposition will be a pushover â€“ and certainly not Brazilian outfit Flamengo.</p>
      <p>But first, Al-Sadd and Hienghene have to battle it out to take on Monterrey to see which of the trio will get to take on Liverpool in the semi-final.</p>
      <p>In the other semi, the winner of Al-Hilal and ES Tunis will take on the Brazilians with the winner of that trio advancing to the final. There will also be a third-place play off for the two teams that fall in the semis.</p>
      <p>The competition will commence on the 11th of December when Al-Sadd take on Hienghene and it will all come down to the final which will take place ten days later on the 21st.</p>
