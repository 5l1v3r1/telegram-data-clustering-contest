      <p>The secret documents came to the <a href="https://www.icij.org/">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> via a chain of exiled Uighurs. Their authenticity was confirmed by several leading experts, including James Mulvenon, vice-president of Defense Group Inc, Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C. and several intelligence sources who cannot be identified.</p>
      <p>There is also a key signature on the documents: <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/xinjiangs-architect-of-mass-detention-zhu-hailun">Zhu Hailun</a>, head of Xinjiang’s Political and Legal CommissionA key signature. Two people our sources spoke to say they have seen Zhu’s signature and are certain it is his signature and handwriting. They have provided convincing explanations of how they encountered signatures.</p>
