      <p>SHREVEPORT, La. (KABC) -- A bank robber received a lot of attention following a clumsy escape from his heist in Louisiana.<br/><br/>The local sheriff's office shared surveillance footage of the criminal getting away after he allegedly robbed a credit union in Shreveport - but not before tripping multiple times along the way.<br/><br/>The man was shown falling three times before he reached his getaway car and took off.<br/><br/>Some locals who watched the footage were in disbelief that the alleged robber got away.<br/><br/>"He's a lucky man because all you got to do is fall once. At least that's the way it is in the movies," said one resident.<br/><br/>The suspect has not been identified.</p>
