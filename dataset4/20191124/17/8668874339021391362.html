      <h1>Champions Cup XV of the Week - Round 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:08:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Shaw</a></address>
      <p>It was a weekend of consolidation in the <a href="https://index.rugbypass.com/rpi/european-champions-cup/all/all/7-days/high-to-low/teams/">Heineken Champions Cup</a>, as a number of teams <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/champions-cup-xv-of-the-week-round-1-2/">backed up impressive wins in Round 1</a> with similar results a week later, giving themselves a strong grip on their respective pools and healthy representation in our XV.</p>
      <p>Ulster, Exeter Chiefs, Leinster, Northampton Saints and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse">Toulouse</a> all went two from two, whilst <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92">Racing 92</a> played out an entertaining 21-21 draw at Thomond Park, after both teams recorded wins in the opening round.</p>
      <p>We have selected our XV of the week from the 10 matches, as teams begin to eye up the back-to-back fixtures in December and the potential quarter-final consequences and permutations that will come as a result of them.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="15"><b>Mike Haley</b>, Munster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>An excellent all-round display from Haley who was as reliable as the last line of defence for Munster, as he was creative and efficient in his attacking responsibilities. Racing found success against Munster in the battle for the gain-line up front, though Haley made the most of the defensive and offensive opportunities that came his way, despite that advantage for the French side.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/elliot-daly/">Elliot Daly</a>, Saracens</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/thomas-ramos/">Thomas Ramos</a>, Toulouse</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="14"><b>Teddy Thomas</b>, Racing 92</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Racing’s wide man was in typically incisive form at Thomond Park and he repeatedly gave the Munster defence cold sweats. His footwork and turn of pace was usually good for making at least one would-be tackler miss, whilst he held up well defensively, too. It was a clean and clinical performance from the wing.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/rotimi-segun/">Rotimi Segun</a>, Saracens</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/jack-nowell/">Jack Nowell</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="13"><b>Rohan Janse van Rensburg</b>, Sale Sharks</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The South African’s ability to get over the gain-line was arguably the difference for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> against La Rochelle, as the home side struggled to make the most of their one and two-man advantages during the game. Although Sale didn’t click fully in the game, Janse van Rensburg did his job well and gave Sale the early momentum that they maintained in the second half.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/henry-slade/">Henry Slade</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/sofiane-guitoune/">Sofiane Guitoune</a>, Toulouse</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="12"><b>Sam Johnson</b>, Glasgow Warriors</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> were well-beaten by surging second half from Exeter, Johnson can hold his head high. The inside centre frequently broke the line and created attacking opportunities for his side, though most were stamped out by resilient and effective Exeter defence. Nevertheless, Johnson gave the English side their fair share of anxious moments.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/lyon/players/charlie-ngatai/">Charlie Ngatai</a>, Lyon</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/robbie-henshaw/">Robbie Henshaw</a>, Leinster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="11"><b>Tom Collins</b>, Northampton Saints</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Collins was clinical against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/benetton">Benetton</a> and his two tries were pivotal in ensuring Saints could come back from a slow start, secure the win and head into the December back-to-backs with two wins from two for the English club. He offered a contrasting but equally effective threat to usual standout Taqele Naiyaravoro.</p>

      <p>Silver – Tom O’Flaherty, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/keith-earls/">Keith Earls</a>, Munster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="10"><b>Finn Russell</b>, Racing 92</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When given a platform to perform, there are few, if any more incisive operators in world rugby than Russell. The Scotsman came up with a number of moments of class at Thomond Park and helped his side leave <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> with two points that could prove vital when the quarter-finalists are ultimately decided.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/dan-biggar/">Dan Biggar</a>, Northampton Saints</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/marcus-smith/">Marcus Smith</a>, Harlequins</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="9"><b>John Cooney</b>, Ulster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The scrum-half continues to push his claim for a role with Ireland, as he guided his side to an impressive win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont">Clermont</a> in Belfast on Friday evening. He tested the fringes, distributed the ball accurately and quickly and was a key component in ensuring that <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> played the game in the right areas of the pitch.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Silver – Cobus Reinach, Northampton Saints</p>
      <p>Bronze – Faf de Klerk, Sale Sharks</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Mako Vunipola</b>, Saracens</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Vunipola didn’t take long to shake off any potential post-Rugby World Cup rust, as he went about giving <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> set-piece dominance and very handy platform for his cousin, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/manu-vunipola/">Manu Vunipola</a>, to operate from at a fly-half. His tireless work in the loose, not mention that efficiency with which he executes, continues to set him apart among loosehead props.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/etienne-falgoux/">Etienne Falgoux</a>, Clermont</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/alec-hepburn/">Alec Hepburn</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="2"><b>Hame Faiva</b>, Benetton</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The hooker bagged two tries as his Benetton side came within inches of a morale-boosting draw – or even a win – against Northampton. His lineout throwing was also relatively accurate and his contributions in the loose were telling. He led the way in another performance that underlines Benetton’s credentials at this level, after the encouraging display against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster">Leinster</a> in the opening round.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/corne-fourie/">Corne Fourie</a>, Gloucester</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/rob-herring/">Rob Herring</a>, Ulster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="3"><b>Levan Chilachava</b>, Montpellier</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Georgian tighthead constantly put <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> under pressure on Sunday afternoon. He turned the screw at the set-piece and the English side really had no answer for the lesson in scrummaging that he put on. It wasn’t the most open game and Chilachava’s performance suited Montpellier’s game plan perfectly.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/brive/players/demba-bamba/">Demba Bamba</a>, Lyon</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/charlie-faumuina/">Charlie Faumuina</a>, Toulouse</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/RugbyPass/status/1198588256885063683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="4"><b>Alex Craig</b>, Gloucester</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Craig played with energy and work rate against a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier">Montpellier</a> pack that generally had the advantage on Gloucester physically. His match-up with Jacques du Plessis was fun to watch and the South African went well into he saw red for elbowing a Gloucester player in the face during a maul.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/connacht/players/ultan-dillane/">Ultan Dillane</a>, Connacht</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/la-rochelle/players/romain-sazy/">Romain Sazy</a>, La Rochelle</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="5"><b>James Ryan</b>, Leinster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A powerful and decisive display from the Leinster lock. The Irish province were not at their best out in Lyon, but Ryan’s contribution was particularly significant in ensuring that they returned home with a haul of four points. His ball-carrying was pivotal, whilst his defence on the gain-line was physical and unrelenting.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/jonny-hill/">Jonny Hill</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks/players/jean-luc-du-preez/">Jean-Luc du Preez</a>, Sale Sharks</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/RugbyPass/status/1198532992186175488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="6"><b>Dave Ewers</b>, Exeter Chiefs</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A second dominant and physical performance in as many weeks for Ewers, who looks like he is well passed his injury issues and showing the kind of form that had him linked with a regular role with England. He was too powerful at the contact area and in the defensive line for Glasgow to deal with and he helped disrupt the usually effective high-tempo style of the Scottish side.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/wenceslas-lauret/">Wenceslas Lauret</a>, Racing 92</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/chris-robshaw/">Chris Robshaw</a>, Harlequins</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="7"><b>Ben Earl</b>, Saracens</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The openside ran rampant at Allianz Park against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> and it took a performance of the highest quality to see off the challenges of the two prominent Irish opensides below. The Ospreys may not currently be the sternest of competition currently, though this was another marker put down by Earl, both with and without the ball, that he is ready to step up to international rugby and should be in contention for a back row spot with England.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/jordi-murphy/">Jordi Murphy</a>, Ulster</p>
      <p>Bronze – Josh van der Flier, Leinster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="8"><b>Marcell Coetzee</b>, Ulster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The South African’s bid to make the Springbok squad for the British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> tour goes from strength to strength, with yet another physical and disciplined display in Europe. He showed all his assets as a back rower on Friday evening, dominating the breakdown, carrying with menace in the tight and not giving an inch in defence.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/lyon/players/carl-fearns/">Carl Fearns</a>, Lyon</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/sam-simmonds/">Sam Simmonds</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
