      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">WWE Survivor Series</a> is set to commence in a few hours. For the first time in the history of the PPV, we will see three brands battling it out for brand supremacy. The NXT Superstars are the ultimate underdogs heading into the show and it would be interesting to see how they fare against RAW and SmackDown.</p>
      <p>This year’s Survivor Series has allowed the creatives to book multiple dream matches featuring Superstars who are otherwise used to repetitive storylines on the supposed ‘main-roster’. Tonight, some of them might step out of their comfort zone and deliver spots that we will remember in years to come.</p>
      <p>Among all the WWE Superstars who will be representing their respective brands tonight, there are a few who will make the most of this opportunity and emerge as the biggest highlights of the show.</p>
      <p>In this list, we will take a look at five WWE Superstars who could shine at Survivor Series 2019 and steal the show.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/drew-mcintyre">Drew McIntyre</a> was reportedly in line for a huge push and was expected to challenge <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/seth-rollins">Seth Rollins</a> for the Universal Championship. However, those plans were derailed owing to the rivalry between 'The Architect' and The Fiend.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for McIntyre, he has another opportunity at Survivor Series to remind the WWE Universe of his brutality. His entire run on the main roster has been about proving his mettle against the celebrated personalities of the roster. McIntyre has often called out the creatives for giving more importance to the ‘legends’ as compared to the current Superstars.</p>
      <p>At Survivor Series, he will be representing RAW and can capitalize on this chance to establish himself as a dominant force on the Red brand. If the creatives want to him to continue as a heel, McIntyre might end up attacking his teammates during the match. This will also allow WWE to initiate a feud between him and the likes of Rollins, Ricochet or Randy Orton which will prove to be good for business in the coming weeks.</p>
