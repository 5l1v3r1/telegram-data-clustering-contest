And as all 12 jungle chums bed down for their first night together, here's what we learned tonight: BOSSING IT: James aka The Big Man/Ol’ Sausage Fingers/Jungle President is camp leader and he’s chosen Jacqueline as his deputy. SKIMPING: No-one took a shower in a white bikini tonight. SOAPY: Andy is basically just Kirk from Corrie in a hat. FESTIVE: Cliff’s already got his Christmas tree up. Bit premature, mate. DELICIOUS: Eating cows’ eyes make your tongue go black. (Thanks for teaching us that, Caitlyn.) STYLISH: Kate Garraway needs to nail that beachy hair look in her day job. UH-OH: With a trial ahead of them, Ian and Jacqueline’s Sunday night dread is going to be worse than yours. I'm A Celeb is back at 9pm on Sunday and we'll be back to watch Wrighty and JJ go down that hell hole. Until then… don't have nightmares!</li>

Except if you're Myles Stephenson. Oh no, that constant surveillance isn't enough for the Rak-Su star – he's also asked for an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10408947/im-a-celeb-myles-stephenson-luxury-item-camera/">instant camera as his luxury item</a>. Look at the glee on his little face though.</li>

It's not like the celebs had to actually eat the pesky critters of The Pest Office, but <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10408701/im-a-celebrity-bushtucker-trial-critters-mouths/">viewers were disgusted by it</a>. After their moment of fame being held in the mouths of the famous, those insects lived to fight another day and are probably doing interviews about the time they tickled Caitlyn's tonsils right now.

Whether she's raising an eyebrow with a cheeky one-liner, teaching the camp Girls Aloud dance routines or <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10409913/im-a-celeb-nadine-coyle-recreates-gillian-mckeith-fainting/">doing her Gillian McKeith impression</a>, she's a goddess of the jungle.</li>

But tonight they proved they’ve already got the lifts down, so why not give it a go?</li>
