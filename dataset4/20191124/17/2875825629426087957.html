      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson and Ed Woodward were pictured engaged in what appeared to be a heated debate as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> struggled in the first half against Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>The legendary Manchester United manager and the club's executive vice-chairman watched the action from the stands of Bramall Lane this weekend.</p>
      <p>Ferguson regularly travels around the country to watch his beloved United in action, and has witnessed first hand their slow decline since he stepped down as boss in 2013.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Ferguson and Woodward were snapped mid-conversation and appeared animated as they presumably talked about the problems at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The pair chatted for a few minutes, with Woodward seen passionately getting his words across and using his hands to illustrate his point.</p>
      <p>It is not known exactly what the duo discussed as United struggled to shine on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Red Devils side were initially put to the sword by the Blades as the newly-promoted club took the lead in the first half through John Fleck.</p>

      <p>Phil Jones was a fault in the build-up to the goal and was hooked at the break, with Solskjaer going for broke in replacing the defender with Jesse Lingard.</p>
      <p>But the switch did little to spur the Red Devils on, and it wasn't long before Sheffield United doubled their lead through Lys Mousset.</p>
      <p>Twenty minutes before the end Manchester United youngster Brandon Williams smashed home a loose ball in the Blades box to reduce the deficit.</p>
      <p>Mason Greenwood then levelled the scores five minutes later before Marcus Rashford completed the comeback 120 seconds after that.</p>

      <p>But it was the home side who had the final say, with Oli McBurnie equalising for the Blades in the 90th minutes.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer has been under some pressure this season as he has struggled to improve things at Manchester United since replacing Jose Mourinho in 2018.</p>
      <p>Former managerial target Mauricio Pochettino has recently become available after being sacked by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> after five years in charge of the north London club.</p>
      <p>But United's interest in the Argentine has cooled in recent months, despite calls from fans to make him the next Red Devils boss.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, former Red Devils boss Mourinho has replaced Pochettino at Spurs.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was victorious in his first game in charge of Tottenham on Saturday, as Spurs ran out 3-2 winners over West Ham at London Stadium.</p>
      <p>After the match the Portuguese said: "It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness. They did it.</p>

      <p>"I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
      <p>"But it was probably closer to a 4-0 than 3-1. I think my players paid the price of a very difficult week. International break, change of manager, new guy, different training sessions."</p>
