      <p>Some things never change — like Disney's box office domination.</p>
      <p><i>Frozen 2 </i>took in a massive $127 million at the domestic box office this weekend, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-frozen-2-opens-fiery-127m-us-350m-globally-1257656?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">per</a><i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-frozen-2-opens-fiery-127m-us-350m-globally-1257656?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"> The Hollywood Reporter</a></i>, the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/frozen-ii-on-track-for-100-million-plus-opening-biggest-for-animated-film-outside-of-summer/">biggest opening ever</a> for an animated movie released outside of the summer. It's also the third-largest debut for any animated movie in North America after <i>Incredibles 2 </i>and <i>Finding</i> <i>Dory</i>, although if Disney's 2019 remake of <i>The Lion King </i>is counted as an animated film, <i>Frozen 2 </i>would come in fourth.</p>
      <p>This comes near the tail end of a brutal month for sequels and reboots at the box office, with <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/terminator-dark-fate-box-office-flop-1203391309/">Terminator: Dark Fate</a></i>, <i><a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877605/shining-sequel-doctor-sleep-disappoints-box-office">Doctor Sleep</a></i>, and <i><a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879083/charlies-angels-becomes-latest-string-box-office-bombs">Charlie’s Angels</a></i> all bombing during three consecutive weekends. <i>Frozen 2</i>, though, had no problem exceeding expectations and should continue to dominate over the busy Thanksgiving weekend.</p>
      <p>The animated sequel isn't getting any more of an icy reception overseas, either, as it has already racked up $350 million worldwide with the biggest global opening for an animated movie, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/media/frozen-2-box-office/index.html">CNN notes</a>. <i>Frozen 2 </i>is all but certain to be Disney's sixth movie this year to gross more than $1 billion worldwide after <i>Avengers</i>: <i>Endgame</i>, <i>The Lion King</i>, <i>Captain Marvel</i>, <i>Toy Story 4</i>, and <i>Aladdin</i>. The studio should finish 2019 with seven billion-dollar films total considering <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> will almost certainly gross at least that much.</p>
      <p>Prior to 2019, the most billion-dollar movies released by one studio in a single year <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/media/toy-story-4-billion-dollars-disney/index.html">was four</a>. That studio? Yes, you guessed it: Disney.</p>
