      <p>The Gandhinagar police here on Sunday launched a probe into the suspected murder of a retired Sub-Inspector of police.</p>
      <p>The deceased was identified as C.R.Sasidharan, 62. His body was found lying in a pool of blood on the wayside near the Government Medical College.</p>
      <p>The police have taken a person, who lives in the neighbourhood of the victim, into custody for interrogation.</p>
      <p>According to officials, the victim had gone out for morning walk when he was subjected to a brutal attack by a sharp-edged weapon. A postmortem examination later attributed the cause of death to injuries on the head and the hand.</p>
      <p>Preliminary investigations suggested that the victim had recently entered into an altercation with one of his neighbours.</p>
      <p>Based on the finding, the person has been taken into custody and is being interrogated.</p>
      <p>They, however, are yet to dig out any solid evidence pointing to his involvement in the crime.</p>
      <p>The body was handed over to his relatives after the post mortem examination.</p>
      <p>A special team led by the Deputy Police Superintendent R.Sreekumar has been constituted to probe the case.</p>
