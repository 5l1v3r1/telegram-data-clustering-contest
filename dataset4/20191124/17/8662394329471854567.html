      <h1>Midnight in Braddon welcomes first residents</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Bladen</a></address>
      <p>Braddon has welcomed a flood of new residents in recent weeks as buyers unloaded moving trucks and unpacked their boxes to move into Geocon's Midnight development.</p>
      <p>Among those to have moved into the recently-completed development are Cassandra and Ben Smith.</p>

      <p>The couple moved into a penthouse that has its own private rooftop terrace.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith said they purchased the apartment off the plan more than two years ago and described the terrace rooftop as the "deal sealer".</p>
      <p>"That was a selling point for us, we love the idea of feeling outside but being right in the middle of the city," she said.</p>
      <p>"We've got views from Mount Ainslie, right over the city and onto Black Mountain Tower."</p>
      <p>The penthouse is connected to the terrace via an atrium with a spiral staircase.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith said she planned to put a fire pit with amphitheatre-style seating and a bar on the terrace, and was "really excited" to watch the New Years Eve fireworks from the terrace.</p>

      <p>The couple, who have moved in along with dog Archibald, purchased into the Geocon-development more than two years ago, and Ms Smith said it was a "lifestyle swap" from their Kambah home.</p>
      <p>"For us, we couldn't even walk to a cafe where we lived but now there is one in every second shop," she said.</p>
      <p>Geocon managing director Nick Georgalis said the rooftop terrace was unheard of prior to the completion of Midnight.</p>
      <p>"I firmly believe that Cassandra's apartment is one of the best spots to live in Canberra," he said.</p>
      <p>"The standard amenity in Midnight is the best you'll find in Canberra city and her apartment has the added bonus of a rooftop terrace."</p>

      <p>The 230-apartment development started to welcome residents this month.</p>
      <p>Mr Georgalis said by Tuesday about 80 per cent of all buyers at Midnight had settled on their apartment.</p>
      <p>"We are thrilled to see people moving into Midnight and even more pleased to hear they are happy with their apartment," he said.</p>
      <p>"All of these new residents will be looking to move in, or have their apartments rented, within the next couple of months."</p>
