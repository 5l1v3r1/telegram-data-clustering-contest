      <p>Myles Garrett won’t be on the field the rest of the season, but he’s still on the mind of Cleveland Browns owner Dee Haslam.</p>
      <p>Prior to today’s game against the Miami Dolphins, Haslam appeared on the field wearing a knit winter hat with Garrett’s No. 95 on the side. Judging by her headgear, Haslam looks to be fully supporting Garrett.</p>
      <p>The third-year defensive end was suspended indefinitely by the NFL following an on-field confrontation with the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Mason Rudolph 10 days ago. Garrett swung Rudolph’s helmet at the quarterback, resulting in the harsh punishment.</p>
      <p>Last week, the NFL upheld the ban after Garrett’s appeal. During his appeal hearing, Garrett alleged Rudolph called him a racial slur before he attacked him with the helmet, a claim Rudolph vehemently denied and the NFL says it has “<a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/22/nfls-conclusion-on-myles-garretts-claim-of-a-slur-overlooks-one-key-piece-of-evidence/">no evidence</a>” of.</p>

      <p>The Garrett-less Browns have won two games in a row heading into today’s contest against the lowly Dolphins.</p>
      <p>Cleveland will have to win at least five of its final six games to have a shot at a Wild Card berth, so there’s really no margin for error.</p>
      <p>Browns-Dolphins will kick off at 1 p.m. ET.</p>
