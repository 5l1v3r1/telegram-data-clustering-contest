      <h2>Former NYC mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg formally announces entry into already crowded 2020 Democratic presidential field.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Arutz Sheva Staff</a></address>
      <p>Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially launched his bid Sunday for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who served as mayor from 2002 to 2013 as both a Republican (prior to 2007) and as an independent (from 2007 on), joins a crowded primary field as he returns to the Democratic party, his political home prior to running as Republican in 2001.</p>
      <p>The former mayor kicked off his presidential bid Sunday with a massive $31 million television ad purchase, the largest single week expenditure ever measured, Advertising Analytics told <i>NBC News</i>.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes Bloomberg, 77, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/259961"><b>previously announced in March</b></a> that he would not run for president in 2020, due to what he cited as the “difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, however, he <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271309"><b>filed for the 2020 Democratic primary in Alabama</b></a>, before filing paperwork <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272088">for a primary run</a>.</p>
      <p>Polls taken before Bloomberg’s entry into the race show him in seventh place, trailing the top three polling candidates – Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren – by double digits, with just 2.3% support among Democratic primary voters, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.</p>
      <p>In the Iowa caucus, Bloomberg is currently polling at just one percent, according to the RCP average of polls.</p>
