      <p>As part of our ongoing series to educate users about some of the more silly phishing scams out there, we bring a new one that states Excel is blocked unless you login and verify your details.</p>
      <p>As people get more educated about phishing scams and how to spot them, we continue to see scammers create outlandish campaigns in order to bait people into entering their login credentials.</p>
      <p>Such is the case with this new phishing email that states you wont be able to use you Excel due to a "system delay" unless you first login.</p>

      <p>The full text of this email is below.</p>
      <pre>YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN EXCEL OR ANY DOCUMENT FILE DUE TO SYSTEM DELAY. <br/>KINDLY CLICK BELOW AND COMPLETE THE DETAIL TO VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT.  <br/><br/>       CONFIGURE EXCEL AND PDF SETTINGS        <br/></pre>
      <p>If a user clicks on the "Configure Excel and PDF Settings", they will be brought to a login form hosted on SharePoint that pretends to be an Excel shared document.</p>

      <p>If a user enters their credentials, the information will be saved so that attackers can access and it used for BEC scams or take over other accounts the victim owns.</p>
      <p>As always, if you find a suspicious email related to your email accounts or login credentials, before clicking any links or entering your credentials, be sure to contact your system administrator.</p>
