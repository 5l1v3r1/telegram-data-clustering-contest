      <h1>Same old problems undermine predictable Cardiff Blues as apathy grows on Arms Park terraces</h1>
      <h2>Cardiff Blues' problems were laid bare as they went down to a depleted Leicester Tigers side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:13:25+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Southcombe</a></address>
      <p>As soon as the Leicester Tigers team was named to face <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-blues">Cardiff Blues</a> , it should have been pinned up on the tactics board at the Arms Park.</p>
      <p>Right next to it, should have been the list of players the English club chose to leave out for the European Challenge Cup fixture on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>England World Cup stars Manu Tuilagi, George Ford, Ben Youngs and Dan Cole were all rested, along with a raft of other first-choice players.</p>
      <p>It told you everything you needed to know about Leicester boss Geordan Murphy's opinion of the fixture and should have served as all the motivation the Welsh region needed.</p>
      <p>The Blues appeared to be the stronger side on paper and should have swaggered into the match with enough confidence to see off their second-string visitors.</p>
      <p>What transpired, however, was a lacklustre performance devoid of substance or punch which was directionless at times <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-leicester-live-score-17306224">as they went down 14-11 thanks to a last-minute penalty.</a></p>
      <p>John Mulvihill's side enjoyed 67 per cent possession, 65 per cent territory, carried twice as much as Leicester and made more metres. Why, then, did they end up on the wrong side of the scoreline?</p>
      <p>The majority of their problems revolve around the attack.</p>

      <p>You can't approach this issue without first pointing to a problem that has been slapping everyone involved in the region square in the face for years.</p>
      <p>They lack power in the tight five and they know it. Mulvihill admitted as much before the match when he revealed their recruitment next season will be focused on the forward pack.</p>
      <p>To be fair to the Aussie, this issue pre-dates his arrival at the Arms Park and quite why it has never been fixed, while they splurge on two Wales internationals out wide, is perplexing.</p>
      <p>There is a dearth of line-busting, momentum-building ball-carriers in the side and it tells in the way they attack.</p>
      <p>Because of this, the Blues are unable to systematically break teams down and it leads to them becoming reliant on the individual brilliance of the likes of Willis Halaholo and their evasive wingers.</p>
      <p>Looping wide passes out to the 15 metre channels are commonplace at the Arms Park. It may look haphazard and a little aimless but they're desperate to get the ball out wide because that's where their strengths are.</p>
      <p>The trouble is, they have become predictable and easy to defend against, evidenced in the fact that they had so much ball against Tigers and managed to do so little with it.</p>

      <p>Leicester were blitzing hard and had their wingers defending high up the pitch. It stifled the Blues' efforts to operate in the wider channels and nullified their threats.</p>
      <p>A perfect example came in the closing stages when replacement Matthew Morgan found himself on the end of a long, speculative pass, leaving him isolated and eventually turned over.</p>
      <p>An effective way to beat a blitz is to go into the arm wrestle, play off your scrum half and generate momentum that way, which should create openings out wide.</p>
      <p>But the hosts were unable to win that physical confrontation.</p>
      <p>Jason Tovey had some joy later in the second half by cross-kicking to his wings but the hosts should, perhaps, have looked to chip in behind an onrushing Leicester defence more often.</p>
      <p>Losing Willis Halaholo to a knee injury in the first half and then Nick Williams at half time laid bare their problems.</p>
      <p>The hot-stepping centre was their biggest individual attacking threat in the first half, with his ability to beat defenders with little space around him. When he left the field, the Blues appeared to lack any sort of invention.</p>

      <p>As for Williams, his departure signalled the loss of the side's most effective ball-carrier in the tight. In the second half, the Blues could only manufacture one real chance of note.</p>
      <p>Mulvihill and attack coach Richie Rees may need to revert back to the drawing board but they cannot legislate for the individual errors that hurt their side.</p>
      <p>Lloyd Williams took a step and got caught at the back of a scrum early in the second half, losing possession, though Sam Lewis did appear slightly offside.</p>
      <p>Minutes later, from a set piece, Jason Tovey's wide pass was yards away from any team-mate and a half-hearted counter-attack from Hallam Amos got him turned over two minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Though the Blues were better, they were not faultless without the ball either.</p>
      <p>Defence coach Richard Hodges will want to know how Amos ended up defending a six-on-one, with Will Boyde tracking back, in the build up to Leicester's first half try.</p>
      <p>A handful of simple carries around the corner were enough to unpick the defence. The Blues failed to identify where their visitors were going to attack and neglected to fold around the corner to guard the far side of the field.</p>

      <p>It was inexcusable stuff from the hosts.</p>
      <p>Sure, there are excuses if you want to find them. Leicester's Harry Wells was lucky not to receive yellow or worse for dropping an elbow on Lloyd Williams in the second half.</p>
      <p>Aled Summerhill would have scored were it not for a brilliant tackle from Welshman Sam Costelow and there are some notable absentees.</p>
      <p>But excuses won't wash. Certainly not for those who braved a cold November night on the Arms Park terraces. That Blues side should have taken their under-strength visitors to the cleaners.</p>
      <p>Apathy is festering among a fan base who are becoming increasingly frustrated, harbouring the perception that the region's hierarchy are not addressing the issues and, more pertinently, not communicating their intentions.</p>
      <p>The region has found itself in this position many times before, which is feeding a sense of disillusionment.</p>
