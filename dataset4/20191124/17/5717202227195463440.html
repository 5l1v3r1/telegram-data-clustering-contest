      <p>Tottenham Hotspur face a battle to hold onto Troy Parrott as Borussia Dortmund enter the race.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1208359/Tottenham-transfer-news-Borussia-Dortmund-Troy-Parrott-Jose-Mourinho">According to The Express</a>, four European giants are now in the hunt to sign Parrott from Tottenham. Dortmund recently raided the Premier League to sign Jadon Sancho and turn him into an England international and they are hoping to replicate that success with Parrott.</p>
      <p>Spurs rate Parrott highly and Mauricio Pochettino handed him his debut earlier this season. The 17-year-old started against Colchester United in the EFL Cup.</p>

      <p>Parrott has been prolific at youth level and he also earned his first senior cap. The Republic of Ireland starlet made his senior debut against New Zealand in a friendly earlier this season.</p>
      <p>But Tottenham will have to resist interest from Europe. German duo Dortmund and Bayern Munich will tussle with Juventus and Real Madrid for Parrott in the near future.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Tottenham need to show Parrott that there is a route to the first-team in the future. This would help to convince him that he is in the right place for his development.</p>
      <p>But with Jose Mourinho’s track record of distrusting youth, there are some interesting alternative options. Parrott could look at Sancho’s success as the blueprint for a successful career.</p>
