      <h1>Foreign national killed, five others injured as UN vehicle hit in Kabul blast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:28:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>KABUL: </b>A foreign national was killed and at least five other people wounded in a grenade attack on a United Nations vehicle in Kabul on Sunday, an Afghan official said.</p>
      <p>The attack happened on a road frequently used by UN traffic shuttling workers between central Kabul and a large UN compound on the outskirts of the capital.</p>
      <p>“At around 6:20pm (1350 GMT) a grenade was hurled at a UN vehicle,” interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.</p>
      <p>Aside from the one fatality, Rahimi said five other people — including two Afghan staff — were wounded. The nationalities of the other victims were not released.</p>
      <p>A UN official did not immediately return a message seeking comment, and no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban did not respond to a query.</p>
      <p>The blast comes during what has been a period of relative and uneasy calm in Kabul, where the rate of large-scale attacks has dropped in recent weeks.<br/>The comparative lull followed a blood-stained presidential campaign season that ended with a general election nearly two months ago.</p>
      <p>But Afghans are still waiting for the results of that September 28 poll, with a recount bogged down by various technical difficulties and complaints from main candidates.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Afghans are waiting to see what might happen next in negotiations between the Taliban and the US.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump in September ended those yearlong talks as Taliban violence continued, but on Friday he suggested to US broadcaster <i>Fox News</i> that negotiations could be getting underway again.</p>
      <p>Aid agencies and non-governmental groups are sometimes targeted in Afghanistan’s war.</p>
      <p>For instance, the Taliban in May targeted Counterpart International, a US-funded non-profit group working with marginalised people. Nine people were killed in that attack.</p>
      <p>But the UN’s white vehicles, easily identifiable with the world body’s initials painted on the side, are rarely involved in attacks and circulate routinely around Kabul and in the provinces.</p>
      <p>In 2011, seven foreign UN workers — including four Nepalis, a Swede, a Norwegian and a Romanian — were killed in an attack on a UN compound in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</p>
