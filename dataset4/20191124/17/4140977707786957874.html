          <p>India’s first ever Day-night test ended in a rather tame fashion as Virat Kohli’s side romped towards yet another innings victory against the visiting Bangladesh team. It took the men in blue a little over 2 days to script a convincing win and take the series 2-0.</p>

                <p>Like the first match, the game was decided on the first day itself when the visitors were bundled out for a paltry 106. Led by Virat Kohli’s century, India posted 347/9 dec in response. Bangladesh folded pretty quickly once again to hand the match to the hosts.</p>
                <p>After the match, Kohli was all praises for his team and made a special mention for the fast bowlers. He ended his interview with a special tribute for BCCI President Sourav Ganguly and praised him for starting the winning culture in Indian cricket. A touching gesture, however, Sunil Gavaskar felt wronged by the comment and let his feelings known.</p>

                      <h3>Sunil Gavaskar criticises Virat Kohli over his tribute for Sourav Ganguly</h3>
                      <p>Former Indian captain, Sunil Gavaskar, took the time to remind Kohli, that India did not start winning from 2000’s and his side in the 70’s and 80’s was also picking up victories. He even went on to say that perhaps Kohli was pandering to the BCCI President.</p>
                      <p><i>“This is a fantastic win but I would like to make a point. The Indian captain said that this thing started in 2000 with Dada’s team. I know Dada is the BCCI president, so maybe he wanted to say nice things about Dada. But India was also winning in 1970s and 1980s. He wasn’t born then,”</i> Sunil Gavaskar said on air.</p>

                          <p><i>“A lot of people still think that cricket started in only in 2000s. But the Indian team won in 1970s overseas. Indian team won in 1986 overseas. Indian team drew series overseas. They lost like other teams did,” </i>he added.</p>
