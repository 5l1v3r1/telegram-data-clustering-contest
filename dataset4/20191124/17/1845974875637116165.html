      <h1>Chelsea: There’s more to fullbacks than pace, and other lessons learned</h1>

      <h4>In a well contested match between Chelsea and Manchester City, Frank Lampard’s team were at the wrong end of the score line due to mistakes and inefficiencies.</h4>
      <p>The game at the Etihad was always going to be close. While both teams had plenty of chances, the game with a tight score line. However, Chelsea ended in the loss column, but it was only due to foreseen mistakes, the absence of some players and poor defensive tactics. Here are three lessons we learned.</p>
      <h3>1. There are more important things than pace</h3>
      <p>Emerson should not start over Reece James. Considering that this was a big game, it could be hard for any manager to expect a young player to perform. However, what we know about Emerson, it would have been a better option to start Reece James, or even Marco Alonso.</p>
      <p>Emerson was a liability to the team the entire time he was on the pitch. He failed to track back on time and cover the space to prevent crosses from Kevin De Bruyne or the runs from Riyad Mahrez. Throughout the match, every City player who walked into the Emerson territory had plenty of space and time to pick a pass and make the rest of the defense uncomfortable. Many times, it was Fikayo Tamori’s instinct and skill that saved the team in dangerous situations.</p>
      <p>While pace is an important attribute for a left-back, there are <a href="https://theprideoflondon.com/2019/11/24/chelsea-goalkeeper-defender-player-ratings-manchester-city/"><b>other things to take into account</b></a>. These include positioning, space awareness, tackling skills and crossing when up the field. Emerson exhibited none of these throughout the game. For the next big game, Frank Lampard should recognize that maybe technical ability is more important than speed.</p>
      <h3>2. Jorginho should not have played</h3>
      <p>It was a difficult call for Frank Lampard to drop any midfielder from this game, but he got it wrong by dropping Mason Mount and keeping Jorginho.</p>
      <p>First, the Chelsea system is already used to having Mount pressing the opposition’s defense almost like a second striker. Further, Tammy Abraham’s success so far this season has been in part to his connection with Mount. Without him in the advanced position, Chelsea failed to create as many chances as they usually do.</p>
      <p>But more importantly, Jorginho failed at just about any task in this game. From a defensive point of view, not only did he make silly mistakes, one of which led to a City goal, but he failed to get back into position too often. His passes, for the most part, were of the stereotypical five-yard variety, not creating any attacking option. This sapped Chelsea’s urgency when down one goal, and they did not push forward. Rather, thanks to Jorginho, the team were content playing side to side, or back to the defense.</p>
      <p>Mateo Kovacic could have done Jorginho’s job far better in both the defensive and offensive phases. Needless to say, Kovacic is more comfortable on the ball and retains possession better; and he makes more efforts with penetrating passes to the forwards. Had Mount been in the game, surely Chelsea would have drawn or won the match.</p>

      <h3>3. Chelsea need to learn to adapt quickly</h3>
      <p>Chelsea lost control of the game, but more importantly, they were incapable of getting it back. In the first half it was all about Chelsea; and, despite being behind, they looked like they could come back and win the game. Then the second half started, and Chelsea were not the same. The Blues were being pressured into making silly mistakes, were unable to create chances, and ultimately failed to take back control.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Chelsea have unable to take back a game and apply any real pressure. Once the opposition makes tactical changes, the Blues are unable to rebuild their rhythm. This is a problem that needs to be addressed this season, and it needs to be done fast. And it is not just about the manager. The players need to be more aware of their surroundings and how to proceed once the opposition pins them down.</p>
      <p>This problem can be traced back to last season where Chelsea did absolutely nothing to change things and try to win the game. While old habits die hard, it is extremely important that the blues let this bad habit go.</p>

      <p>Surely Frank Lampard is not the type of manager who only believes in “one tactic fits all.” For his development and for that of his players, he needs to adapt quickly to change games in the team’s favor.</p>
