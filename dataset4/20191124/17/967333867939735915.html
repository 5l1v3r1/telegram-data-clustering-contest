        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Legislation to protect transgender persons’ rights and welfare is a proposed Act of the Parliament of India. The legislature’s lower house already passed the bill on 5 August and now it's up for discussion in the upper house.</b>

      <p>The transgender community in New Delhi, the national capital of India, held a pride parade as a mark of protest against the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>As per the bill, trans people can only identify themselves as man or woman after they have undergone surgery, says Ray, a trans woman studying at Delhi University.</p>
      <p>The process occurs in two-steps. The first stage mandates that a trans person should apply for a “transgender certificate”, thereby requesting that the authorities change their legal gender.</p>

      <p>Then, the second step requires a person to undergo gender-affirming surgery and acquire documentation from a medical authority.</p>
      <p>Pratay, an educator, says: "The 2014 NALSA (National Legal Services Authority) judgement had given the trans community the right to self-identitfication, but the bill takes that way. It has added the clause of taking certification from authorities about one's identity".</p>
      <p>The National Legal Services Authority versus the Union of India is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of India, which declared transgender people to be a third gender, affirming that the fundamental rights <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201802161061729492-transgender-woman-seeks-mercy-killing/">granted under the Constitution of India</a> will be equally applicable to transgender people and giving them the right to self-identification of their gender as male, female, or third-gender. </p>
