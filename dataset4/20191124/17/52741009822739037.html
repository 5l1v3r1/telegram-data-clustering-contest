      <p>TORONTO — Police say they're looking for four suspects after an alleged violent carjacking in northwest Toronto.</p>
      <p>City police say the incident took place on Friday afternoon while a 56-year-old man was stopped at a stop sign in his Mercedes.</p>
      <p>They allege he was rear-ended by a dark-coloured SUV, which prompted the man to get out of his own vehicle to inspect the damage.</p>
      <p>Police allege three men came out of the SUV and held him at gunpoint, demanding car keys and cellphones.</p>
      <p>Police say the three suspects then got into the Mercedes and drove away, followed by the SUV.</p>
      <p>They're urging anyone with information about the alleged incident to come forward.</p>
      <p>This story by the Canadian Press was first published Nov. 24, 2019.</p>

      <p>Note to readers: This is a corrected story. The original version stated that the Mercedes was the suspect vehicle. In fact, the Mercedes was the vehicle that was allegedly stolen.</p>
