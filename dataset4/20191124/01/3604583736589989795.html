      <p>Are you paying too much for your stain remover? These two young scientists from Ballarat Grammar have discovered you probably are.</p>

      <p>Year 8 students Pippa Murphy and Ashlyn Hall researched and tested three types of stain remover as part of a scientific research project for the Peter Doherty Award.</p>
      <p>They were announced as winners of the annual science award and received a $1000 prize, including $600 for their school to invest in science education, on Wednesday night.</p>
      <blockquote>It was really cool to see the results in the end because I think everyone assumes why something works better but we actually investigated the answer.<cite>Pippa Murphy, student</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Ballarat Tech School director Sofia Fiusco said the focus of the Peter Doherty Award was to encourage curiosity and discovery.</p>
      <p>"We want to help encourage young people to ask questions and research, in the hope it may continue for them in their further studies," she said.</p>
      <p>"It is also about encouraging them that asking questions, researching, looking for the data, and making decisions based on data is a really good skill to have."</p>
      <p>Fourteen students from Mount Clear College, Ballarat Grammar and Phoenix Community College were selected as finalists for the award and showcased their projects during a presentation evening at the Ballarat Tech School on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A panel of judges including scientists from the Fiona Elsey Cancer Research Institute and Mars Confectionery judged each team on the creativity of their approach to solving an everyday issue and their ability to communicate their processes.</p>

      <p>Pippa and Ashlyn explained how they tested home remedy, Vanish and Coles Ultra brand stain removers for their effectiveness in removing five common household stains.</p>
      <p>They found their home remedy stain remover made with two parts hydrogen peroxide, one part dishwashing liquid and a squeeze of lemon was the most effective in removing stains, followed by Coles Ultra.</p>
      <p>"I really enjoy science and always have," Pippa said.</p>
      <p>"It was really cool to see the results in the end because I think everyone assumes why something works better but we actually investigated the answer."</p>
      <p>"It was our first self lead project so it was all brand new to us. I enjoyed having our own path and direction and that we could make decisions ourselves," Ashlyn said.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of students from seven schools participated in the Peter Doherty Award since July through learning sessions at the Ballarat Tech School.</p>
      <p>Sessions covered scientific method, investigating through experiments and communicating science.</p>
      <p>The Peter Doherty Science Award was established in 2009 as a joint initiative from Committee for Ballarat, Ballarat Foundation and Nobel Prize winner Peter Doherty.</p>
      <p>Professor Peter Doherty shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1996 and was Australian of the Year in 1997.</p>
      <p>His intention in creating this award was to encourage excellence in scientific thought and activity in secondary students.</p>
      <p>"We know 75 per cent of jobs require STEM skills - it is that ability to apply analytical processes and critical thinking to what they are doing and to be scientifically minded is a good thing," Ms Fiusco said.</p>
      <p>"Often people think it is going to be too hard but I think this project allows them to navigate through, make mistakes, address those mistakes and find mentors which is a normal part of being a scientist."</p>
