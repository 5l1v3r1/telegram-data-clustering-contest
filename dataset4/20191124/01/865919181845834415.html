      <h1>Cavaliers' Love out against Trail Blazers with sore back</h1>

      <p>CLEVELAND â€” Cavaliers forward Kevin Love is out for the second game this week because of a sore back.</p>
      <p>Love, who averages a team-high 17.9 points, isn't playing Saturday against Portland as Cleveland tries to break a six-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>The All-Star also missed Sunday's game against New York. He played Wednesday in Miami and aggravated the injury Friday in Dallas.</p>
      <p>The Cavaliers complete a stretch of five games in seven days Saturday and play three games next week. Cleveland coach John Beilein wants to be cautious with Love, who is in his 12th season.</p>
      <p>"He could probably gut through it, but it's not advantageous for us or the team tonight or in the future if he tries to gut this through," Beilein said.</p>
