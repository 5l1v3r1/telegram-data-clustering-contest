      <p>Under the provisions of a bill introduced by Maryland state Sen. Clarence Lam, people who violate the statute would be subject to a $250 fine, <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/11/22/it-could-soon-be-illegal-to-release-balloons-in-maryland/">WJZ</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Lam, a Democrat, said he hoped the bill would reduce the amount of waste in the environment and would raise awareness in how to properly dispose of balloons, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>Lam said people would be fined but would not be subject to time in jail, <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/11/22/it-could-soon-be-illegal-to-release-balloons-in-maryland/">WJZ</a> reported. Children also will be exempt from prosecution.</p>
      <p>The proposed bill comes two months after St. Anne's County officials passed a similar measure, <a href="https://mdcoastdispatch.com/2019/09/05/queen-annes-becomes-first-md-county-to-ban-balloon-releases/">The Dispatch</a> of Ocean City reported.</p>
      <p>Lam said balloon waste from releases sometimes ends up in farms and waterways, harming the environment, <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/11/22/it-could-soon-be-illegal-to-release-balloons-in-maryland/">WJZ</a> reported.</p>
      <p>“What goes up must come down, and you won’t know where they will land,” Lam told the television station.</p>
