      <p>A Chinese national reported missing 12 years ago has finally been found after police arrested him for shoplifting.</p>
      <p>The now 40-year-old man, who came to Australia in 2003 to study, initially gave police fake identification when he was arrested.</p>
      <p>He was reported missing by NSW Police in 2007 and has not had contact with his family back in China since 2004.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested at a Parramatta shopping centre on Saturday and has been issued with an infringement notice for shoplifting.</p>
      <p>Police were able to confirm the man’s identity despite him initially giving officers a fake ID.</p>
      <p>The man has been referred to the Department of Home Affairs.</p>
