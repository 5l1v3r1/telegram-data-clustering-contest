      <p>Worried <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kym-marsh">Kym Marsh</a> was almost blinded by her pet chihuahua after she got a little too close to her beloved pup.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star, 43, had to dash to the hospital after the dog accidentally clawed her.</p>
      <p>She revealed in her <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/corrie-kym-marsh-eye-cyst-20923613"><i>OK! magazine</i></a> column that playful Rico scratched her eye so badly that he needed emergency treatment.</p>
      <p>Kym, who is leaving the Cobbles in the coming weeks, recalled the moment fear set in - and the bad news doctors told her.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “As many of you know I’ve got a little chihuahua puppy name Rico.</p>

      <p>“He’s very playful and likes to stroke your face with his paws. But he accidentally pawed my eye.</p>
      <p>“At first it didn’t really hurt but my eye was stinging and when I looked in the mirror the left side was bright red.</p>
      <p>“I went to the opticians and they told me there was a small lump on the eye. They put me on antibiotic drops but over the next few days, things weren’t improving.”</p>
      <p>Doctors told her she had been left with a cyst that may never go away.</p>

      <p>She added: “I ended up going to the eye hospital.</p>
      <p>"After sitting in the waiting room for hours and hours I was the last patient to be seen.</p>
      <p>“The staff were fantastic. They diagnosed me with a conjunctival cyst and gave me steroid drops but warned me the cyst may never go away, which is scary.</p>
      <p>“You take your eyes for granted so it’s really nerve-racking when something like this happens.</p>

      <p>“I’ve just got my fingers crossed that the drops will work.”</p>
      <p>Kym has played troubled Michelle Connor in the soap for 14 years.</p>
      <p>But she won't be killed off - and that means she is free to return in the future.</p>
      <p>When asked whether her character would die, she replied: "No. The door is open so that’s good."</p>
