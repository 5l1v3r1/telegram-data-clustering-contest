      <p>LAND GRABBING IN GUWAHATI</p>
      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI: </b>The Gauhati High Court has directed the Deputy Commissioner of Kamrup (Metropolitan) district to conduct a survey across Guwahati city to identify lands belonging to important sites and institutions which have been grabbed illegally.</p>
      <p>“We hereby direct Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati to have a survey conducted in all parts of Guwahati, identifying lands belonging to Government, Public Sector Undertakings, Local Authorities, Religious Institutions, Charitable Institutions, Endowments, Wakf or land adjoining historical monuments, which have been possessed illegally by other persons. On identification of the said areas, the Deputy Commissioner would be required to file an affidavit as to what action has been taken against the persons, who have committed wrongs and are liable to be proceeded under the Act of 2010 (supra),” an order issued recently by a division bench of the High Court said.</p>
      <p>The bench comprising Chief Justice Ajai Lamba and Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua gave its order following a Suo Moto case taken up by the High Court. The Court took the Suo Moto case after it had gone through reports that lands belonging to the government, public sector undertakings, local authorities, religious or charitable institutions, endowments, wakf or land adjoining historical monuments are being grabbed by others in connivance with government officials and politicians.</p>
      <p>“The administration is turning a blind eye towards such criminal activities of land grabbers,” the High Court order said.</p>
      <p>The High Court has set January 10, 2020 deadline for the DC of Kamrup (Metro) to complete the survey. The DC has to file an affidavit before the court on or before January 20, 2020. The next hearing of the case is on January 22, 2020.</p>
      <p>“Inaction on the part of the authorities is likely to invite exemplary cost,” the High Court order said.</p>
