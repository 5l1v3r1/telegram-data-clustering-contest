      <h1>Roy Keane: 'Manchester City responded like champions'</h1>
      <h2>Former Manchester United captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roy-keane/"><b>Roy Keane</b></a> has hailed <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> for 'responding like champions' in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/result/result-mahrez-nets-winner-as-man-city-overcome-chelsea_380403.html">Saturday's clash with Chelsea</a> at the Etihad Stadium.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a>'s side had fallen <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">12 points behind</a> Premier League leaders Liverpool ahead of the late kickoff in Manchester, and the Citizens went 1-0 behind to Chelsea in the 21st minute of the contest courtesy of a goal from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ngolo-kante/"><b>N'Golo Kante</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kevin-de-bruyne/"><b>Kevin De Bruyne</b></a> levelled the scores before <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/riyad-mahrez/"><b>Riyad Mahrez</b></a> completed the turnaround, though, as the reigning champions returned to winning ways following their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-ruthless-liverpool-overcome-man-city-at-anfield_378576.html">3-1 loss</a> at Liverpool on November 10.</p>
      <p>"Manchester City responded like champions today. They weren't quite at their best but they punished Chelsea for their mistakes and they deserved to win. We saw the quality they have, even with their problems," Keane told <i>Sky Sports News</i>.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately it's what you do with the possession, and I think Chelsea didn't quite do enough. Frank (Lampard) will be pleased, they didn't park the bus and they had a go, but they were punished and that's what the really good teams do.</p>
      <p>"Pep would've wanted a reaction from the game a couple of weeks ago. They've got quality and vast experience and a brilliant coach. I still think he's hurt by that game, there was always going to be a reaction and when they got the equaliser there was no doubt for me they were going to go on and win."</p>
      <p>City have moved above Chelsea into third spot in the table, now one point off second-placed Leicester City but still nine from leaders Liverpool, who <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-roberto-firmino-nets-winner-for-liverpool-at-palace_380355.html">won 2-1</a> at Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon.</p>
