      <p>PARIS: Tens of thousands marched in Paris on Saturday (Nov 23) calling for an end to gender violence and femicide in a country where at least 116 women have been killed by current or former partners this year.</p>
      <p>Central Paris was awash in a sea of purple - the colour adopted for the campaign - as several protesters held up placards bearing the image of a relative or friend killed in gender violence.</p>

      <p>Some signs bore the words "Break the silence, not women," and "Aggressor, stalker, you are done for, the women are in the street".</p>
      <p>"In 32 femicides, it's Christmas," read another.</p>
      <p>A count by the Occurrence consultancy, commissioned by the news media including AFP, put the turnout in the French capital at 49,000.</p>
      <p>Feminist collective #NousToutes ("All of Us") meanwhile said 100,000 marched in Paris, hailing it as "the biggest march against gender-based violence in French history".</p>
      <p>The Paris march was one of 30 organised throughout France involving nearly 70 organisations, political parties, unions and associations.</p>
      <p>"This will be a historic march," said Caroline De Haas, one of the Paris organisers, adding that "the level of awareness is moving at breakneck speed."</p>
      <p>- Women killed every three days -</p>
      <p>A total of 116 women have been murdered in France so far this year by their husband, partner or ex-partner, according to an AFP investigation.</p>
      <p>The group "Femicides by companions or ex" meanwhile puts the toll at 137.</p>
      <p>Some 121 were killed in France last year, according to official figures.</p>
      <p>One woman is killed in France every three days by their partner or ex-partner, while marital violence affects 220,000 Frenchwomen every year.</p>
      <p>"We can no longer count the number of cases where femicides could have been avoided," the organisers said on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"With this march, we will make the public authorities take appropriate measures."</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet has said: "Our system is not working to protect these women."</p>
      <p>The government is expected to announce about 40 measures on Monday to tackle the scourge.</p>
      <p>De Haas and other activists have said a billion euros needs to be invested to address the problem.</p>
      <p>But the office of France's equality ministry said it has put aside 361.5 million euros (US$398 million) a year.</p>
      <p>The killings in France are part of a global scourge that shows no signs of abating, with 87,000 women and girls killed in 2017 according to the UN - over half of them killed either by their spouse, partner or own family.</p>
      <p>In Russia meanwhile, nearly 200 people gathered in a Moscow park on Saturday to denounce a proposed law designed to toughen sanctions for domestic violence.</p>
      <p>March organiser Andrey Kormukhin, a Russian Orthodox activist, said existing laws already protected women sufficiently and argued that the new proposals went against "traditional family values".</p>
      <p>The marches across France come ahead of the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which is on Monday.</p>
