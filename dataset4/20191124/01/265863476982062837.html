      <h1>RHOBH – Lisa Vanderpump Tells Newbies Garcelle Beauvais &amp; Sutton Stracke ‘Good Bloody Luck’ Ahead Of Their Season 10 Debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:12:07+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:12</time> by <a rel="author">Suzy Kerr</a></address>
      <p>Former <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> star <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/rhobh-ken-todd-says-lisa-vanderpump-is-a-different-person-after-leaving-the-bravo-reality-series-343610/">Lisa Vanderpump</a> infamously left the popular Bravo reality show at the end of last season, and the OG even skipped out of the Season 9 reunion after her falling out with the rest of the cast over #Puppygate. Now, Vanderpump is giving advice to the two newbies in the cast – actress Garcelle Beauvais and party planner Sutton Stracke.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <i>Hollywood Life</i> at her 4th annual Vanderpump Dogs Gala, LVP told Beauvais and Stracke “Good bloody luck,” when asked what advice she would give to the new full-time cast members.</p>

      <p>“All of them…hide under the table. Run!” said Vanderpump. “I don’t know either of them. I don’t know them, but I do wish them luck. Good luck. That’s what I can say.”</p>
      <p>Now that <i>RHOBH</i> is behind her, Vanderpump is focusing on her charity work, her numerous restaurants, and her spin-off <i>Vanderpump Rules</i>. Her husband Ken Todd says that his wife is a “different person” now that she has left the series that made her famous because “she’s got eight b*tches off her back.”</p>
      <p>Vanderpump admits that she hasn’t been paying attention to <i>RHOBH</i> as much as some people think she should, but she has so much going on in her life right now, it’s just not a priority. LVP just opened her new Vanderpump Cocktail Garden in Las Vegas, and she says she will soon be doing something else for Caesars Palace.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old also hinted that a Vanderpump Dogs series could be in the works. Vanderpump says “you know that’s coming,” even though she’s not allowed to say anything about it. And, she added that the “NBC Gods are watching.”</p>
      <p>As for Beauvais and Stracke, they are currently in the middle of shooting their first season of <i>RHOBH</i>. Beauvais is an actress with credits like <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>The Jamie Foxx Show</i>, and she is the first African-American cast member in <i>RHOBH</i> history.</p>

      <p>Stracke is a southern belle who now lives in the 90210, and she was ranked on <i>The Salonniere’s</i> top 100 party planners list back in 2017. She is also the mom of three kids, and she recently opened her fashion, art, and decor store <i>The Sutton Concept</i> after going through a divorce.</p>
      <p>Season 10 of <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> will premiere on Bravo in early 2020.</p>
