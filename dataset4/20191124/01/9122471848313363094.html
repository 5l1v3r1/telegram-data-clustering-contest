      <h1>Report: QB Tate Martell Not Seen At Miami’s Game Tonight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:56:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Miami’s football program is currently halfway toward suffering one of the most-embarrassing losses of the weekend. The Hurricanes are being shut out by FIU, 13-0, after two quarters.</p>
      <p>Tate Martell, the prized quarterback transfer from Ohio State, does not appear to be on hand to witness the embarrassing performance.</p>
      <p><a href="https://247sports.com/college/miami/Article/QB-Tate-Martell-not-present-for-Miamis-game-against-FIU-139093559/">247Sports is reporting</a> that Martell has not been seen at tonight’s game.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear why.</p>
      <blockquote>Quarterback Tate Martell does not appear to be in attendance for Saturday’s game against Florida International at Marlins Park Stadium.<br/><br/>Martell was not seen during pregame warm-ups and did not run out with the team at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Martell did not attend UM’s road game at Pittsburgh on October 26th due to a “medical leave of absence” but he did return to practice the following week leading up to the Florida State game.</blockquote>
      <p>Martell transferred from Ohio State to Miami this offseason. He did not win the Hurricanes’ starting quarterback job and experimented at the wide receivers position. Martell did not end up playing much at wideout, either.</p>
      <p>Miami head coach Manny Diaz recently announced that Martell had shifted back to quarterback, where he would focus 100 percent of his energy on. The Hurricanes said they were developing a package for Martell to get him in some games recently, but that hasn’t happened.</p>
      <p>Martell has not played in a game since a Week 6 loss to Virginia Tech.</p>
      <p>The Hurricanes should have an update on Martell following tonight’s game.</p>
