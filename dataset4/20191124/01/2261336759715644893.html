      <h1>Video: MMA veteran Dustin Long knocks out Marsellos Wilder, brother of Deontay Wilder</h1>

      <p>Ominous sign? Probably not, but the Wilder family will not have an undefeated night in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>On the FS2 undercard of Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz 2, Deontay’s brother Marsellos Wilder (5-2-1 NC, 2 KOs) took on Dustin Long (3-1-2, 2 KOs) in a scheduled six-round cruiserweight bout. Marsellos was in control of the fight entering the 4th round, but a big left hook by Dustin Long smoked Marsellos and ended his night early. Referee Jay Nady saw no need to even count, as Wilder was in no condition to continue.</p>

      <p>Marsellos turned pro in 2018, winning his first three bouts before he was knocked out this past January by William Deets, who currently has a record of 8-14. Needless to say, it is unlikely that the 30-year-old has what it takes to reach the heights of his brother.</p>
      <p>As for Dustin Long, <a href="http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/fighter/Dustin-Long:C743FE3F7B7E1832">he is actually an MMA fighter</a> who has a record of 8-5, including appearances in Ring of Combat and Valor Fights. The most notable opponent he’s faced is Nah-Shon Burrell, who beat him by decision back in 2016.</p>
      <p>Marsellos simply could not handle those MMA angles.</p>
