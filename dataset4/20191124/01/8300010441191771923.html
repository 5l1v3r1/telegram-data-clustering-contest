      <p>BREA, Calif. (KABC) -- You can help make a bit of magic this holiday season by turning gingerbread houses into real houses for people in need.<br/><br/>Lazy Dog Restaurants teamed up with Habitat for Humanity to help the less fortunate. All you have to do is visit a Lazy Dog location, order your food and then buy a gingerbread house kit for $5.95. While you wait for your food, you can build the gingerbread house at your table. All proceeds from the gingerbread house kit sales will go to Habitat for Humanity.<br/><br/>"We've always thought of Lazy Dog as kind of your home away from home, so it's a perfect partnership to come together and help our communities in need," said Chris Simms, Founder and CEO of Lazy Dog Restaurants.<br/><br/>"We'll be building homes for families all over the nation because of those gingerbread houses and the proceeds that we're going to be receiving," said Allison Green of Habitat for Humanity International.<br/><br/>Habitat for Humanity International gives qualified applicants a no-to-low interest mortgage, as affordable housing continues to be out of reach for many across the nation.<br/><br/>"We're actually seeing that one in six families are paying more than 50% of their take home pay on the place they call home and we just don't think that's right," said Green.<br/><br/>According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, that's the reality for one in five households in California.<br/><br/>Armando Raygoza remembers a time when his parents struggled to make ends meet. His life changed in 2008 when Habitat for Humanity approved his family for a mortgage they could afford. Today, Raygoza runs his own business, has a family of his own and is a first-time homeowner.<br/><br/>If you want to help those in need, simply visit your local Lazy Dog location and ask for a gingerbread house kit.</p>
