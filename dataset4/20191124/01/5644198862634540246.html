      <p>MILAN: Gonzalo Higuain grabbed a second-half brace with Paulo Dybala adding a late third as Juventus rescued a 3-1 comeback win over Atalanta in the final quarter of an hour to stay top of Serie A on Saturday (Nov 23).</p>
      <p>Robin Gosens had nodded Atalanta ahead after 56 minutes as the Bergamo side chased their first Serie A win over Juventus since February 2001.</p>

      <p>Higuain hit back with two goals in an eight-minute spell while Dybala marked his 200th Serie A appearance with the final goal two minutes into injury time.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri's side open up a four-point lead on second-placed Inter Milan, who travel to Torino later on Saturday, as Atalanta drop to sixth place after their fourth league game without a win.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo missed the trip to Bergamo despite his four-goal spree for Portugal because of a slight knee problem ahead of Juventus's Champions League game against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In the absence of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, Argentine strike duo Dybala and Higuain ensured the eight-time reigning champions maintained their unbeaten run this season despite several controversial refereeing decisions.</p>
      <p>Higuain had pulled Juventus level after 74 minutes with a ball that took a deflection off Rafael Toloi to beat Pierluigi Gollini in the Atalanta goal.</p>
      <p>The Argentine completed his double when he picked up a cross from Juan Cuadrado on 82 where the Colombian put his hand on the ball during a sliding tackle at the start of the action.</p>
      <p>Then Dybala broke through the Atalanta defense to finish off for his fourth Serie A goal this season.</p>
      <p>Atalanta had their chances with Musa Barrow missing an early penalty.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Gambian rattled the crossbar after 17 minutes following a penalty awarded for a Sami Khedira handball.</p>
      <p>Inter will be looking to make it a perfect seven league games on the road this season as they travel to Torino.</p>
      <p>Serie A runners-up Napoli, in seventh, desperately need a result at 14th-placed AC Milan, who are themselves floundering.</p>
