      <h1>Ryan Day Has Thank You Message For Ohio State Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:01:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State conquered one of its biggest obstacles on Saturday with a win over Penn State. The Buckeyes responded to any and all adversity throughout the game and walked away with a 28-17 win.</p>
      <p>One of the most impressive aspects of the game was the Ohio State crowd. Buckeyes fans have always been some of the loudest and most passionate in college football. But on Saturday, they took it to a whole new level with a top 10 team in town.</p>
      <p>As a result, Ohio State head coach Ryan Day tweeted out a message thanking his team’s fans for their superb showing on Saturday.</p>
      <blockquote>“Thank you Buckeye Nation for bringing it today,” Day said on Twitter. “You made a huge impact on the game and we love you! Let’s keep fighting!!!”</blockquote>

      <p>Certainly a high honor for the Ohio State fans. They clearly made an impact during Saturday’s contest.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes will now shift their focus to the Michigan Wolverines. The classic rivalry will take place next Saturday at noon E.T. on FOX.</p>
      <p>Jim Harbaugh’s squad has plenty of momentum heading into the match-up having won four straight and eight of their last nine games. With the game being played in Ann Arbor, the Wolverines will have a major home-field advantage next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Day will have his team ready for the major challenge next week.</p>
