      <p>Ah, the bane of every non-Korean speaking fans: waiting for the translations to come out! Just how far do international fans have to go to understand their idols' latest videos right away? An i-Lovely came up with this <b>JINius</b> idea to satisfy her fangirling needs.</p>
      <p>An ARMY under the Twitter account of <i>@tteokrjin</i> posted this video on her account.</p>
      <p>BTS Jin took ARMY by surprise when he posted a vlog on V-Live last night, 23rd of November. This was right after their concert in Chiba, Japan where they also held their fanmeeting.</p>

      <p>Struggling to know what Jin is talking about, she immediately turned on Google Translate's<i> "Translate by Speech" </i>option and let the app do its job. It usually takes days for a subbed V-Live to be updated so for now, the fan could only make do of this method. While the translation may not be all accurate, at least she had an idea of what Jin is talking about. It was also good that JIN's speech was clear for the app to understand.</p>
