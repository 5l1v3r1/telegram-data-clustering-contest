      <p>On Friday it was reported that New South Wales police launched a manhunt after a man was found dead under suspicious circumstances.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celeb is filmed in far-north eastern New South Wales on an unused Banana plantation.</p>

But it is very unsettling to know that there is someone out there, running from the police, who has committed such a horrible crime.<br/></i>Investigations are ongoing into the death.<br/>This comes after threats of <a href="https://www.spin1038.com/movies-and-tv/im-celeb-set-threat-control-bush-fires-jungle-903269">bushfires in the area </a>earlier this year.</p>
