      <p>We are in a dangerous world, controlled by the devil and his followers. We need to be spiritually alert. Sin leads to spiritual blindness. “Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry you out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered” (Isaiah 29:9-10). Sin cuts off one’s spiritual awareness in Christ. Adam and Eve were spiritually inclined, until they ate the forbidden fruit. They became carnal and empty.</p>
      <p>A Christian can lose the power of the Holy Spirit, when he gives sin a chance and he then becomes spiritually blind. Being spiritually blind gives birth to destruction. Holding on to Jesus, the Author and finisher of our faith alone, gives you the alertness you need spiritually. You can’t serve two masters. You can’t worship God and mammon together. You must choose Jesus alone. King Solomon’s spiritual blindness brought confusion into his life. Due to his love for foreign women, he disobeyed God and the spirit of God departed from him. He consulted smaller gods, abandoning the greatest God, Who enthroned him.</p>
      <p>The objective of the Devil is to make men Spiritually blind. “In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them” (2Cor. 4:4). We are in a world where immorality, homosexuality, abortion, nudity, perversion, bestiality and many other wrongdoings thrive. But the devil has deceived the world that these abominations don’t matter; it’s just the normal way of life. Our society today embraces things that are strange to God’s Word and plan for us. The devil laughs at humanity because he knows if they continue in these evil ways, their destruction is certain and near.</p>
      <p>Spiritual blindness leads to all evil. All forms of uncleanliness such as idolatry, adultery, fornication, lying, stealing, greed, backbiting, bearing false witness, as well as mass shooting and suicide, which are rampant today, are the results of spiritual blindness. Those who are spiritually blind can’t detect when the devil and his demons will gain entry into their lives. When they gain access, humans are bound to start acting abnormally and irrationally, because the devil and his agents are now in charge of their lives. These unseen forces control and manipulate humans as they please, until such lives are totally destroyed and terminated. “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places” (Ephesians 6:12). The devil is the master and captain of the life of a sinner and a sinner does his master’s bidding.</p>
      <p>The blind cannot lead the blind. Attend churches and fellowships that are deeply rooted in the word of God, so that you are not led to the pit of hell by your church leader. Ask for the power of the Holy Ghost. He will teach and guide you as you read your Bible.<br/>Worship with us @ The Saints’ Gospel Church of Christ – Hand of Fire.
