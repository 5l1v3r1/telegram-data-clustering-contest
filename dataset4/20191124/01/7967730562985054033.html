      <h1>Preview and race-by-race tips for Wagga on Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:38:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:38</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Evans</a></address>
      <p>Track Good 4 and rail out a tricky 7m from 1400m to the WP and True the Remainder so on-pace early before gradual trend to the outside.</p>
      <h3>Race 1 C, G &amp; E BM 58 HCP (1000m)</h3>
      <p>The restricted male sprinters get us underway in a small but competitive field where most have a chance. Goulburn 4YO gelding<b> 2. Bombdiggity</b> hasn't publicly trialled, but returns with a smart fresh record and blinkers on for the first time. Used to carrying big weights, and resumed last prep off a long break with a win as a hot favourite at the Sapphire Coast.</p>

      <p><i>Dangers</i>: Local 7YO gelding <b>5. Powerscourt </b>won two straight, including this track, up to this grade before finishing off late at Albury, and tucked away back on the inside, he'll be the one storming home late. Another Goulburn visitor, 6YO gelding<b> 1. Treasure Boss</b> normally takes a few runs to hit his straps, but the winkers come off, 3kg apprentice provides some weight relief, and draws to sit back with plenty of cover and charge late so don't underestimate. Jerilderie 4YO stallion<b> 3. Delago At Ease</b> has shown plenty of early speed to win his last two, but this is tougher, especially down the much longer straight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Bombdiggity each way and quinella 2 and 5<br/></b>
        <b>Odds and Evens (First 2): Split</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 2 BM 66 HCP (1600m)</h3>
      <p>Kembla 6YO gelding<b> 4. Old Man's Angel</b> has been very consistent this prep, and finished hard in his last two runs at this track. Hard fit and looks ready to win again.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers</i>: Canberra 6YO gelding<b> 1. Supreme Polarity</b> looks well placed fourth-up, and will find this easier than last start BM 70 Federal at home when he led for a long way before being overhauled. Albury 5YO gelding <b>5. Shinseki </b>has also been in and around the placings all prep, and comes out of that same BM 70 Federal at Canberra where he finished off okay despite easing in betting. Expect sharp improvement second-up from 6YO Victorian visitor and Northern Hemisphere-bred <b>2. King Kiritan</b> who wasn't in the hunt resuming in a stronger race at Kyneton, but the winkers go on, and leading stable has an impressive strike rate when they cross the border.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Old Man's Angel each way and box trifecta 1,2,4,5<br/></b>
        <b>Odds and Evens: Split</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 3 CL2 HCP (1400m)</h3>
      <p>Hard to go past emerging and well bred 3YO Victorian colt <b>1. Ajyaal </b>who won two straight at Albury jumping from a Maiden to BM 66 with ease in only his first prep, and despite a sharp rise in weight, looks destined for much better races.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers</i>: Talented 4YO local gelding<b> 2. The Chaplain </b>looks ready now to show his potential after storming home to win this grade at Corowa. Will settle well off the speed and should be even better served on the bigger track, and gets a nice little weight advantage on the top-weight after jockey's claim. Improving 6YO Canberra mare<b> 4. Let Me Guess</b> has also notched up consecutive Maiden and Class 1 wins, but will probably find this too tough; while expect 5YO Canberra mare<b> 6. Metralla </b>to finish off okay coming back from a stronger Highway at Rosehill where he went around at gigantic odds.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Ajyaal to win and quinella 1 and 2<br/></b>
        <b>Odds and Evens: Split</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 4 F &amp; M BM 58 HCP (1000m)</h3>
      <p>Now the girls lock horns over five furlongs, and smart 4YO Canberra mare<b> 2. Flying Yankee</b> looks a good thing returning off a five-month break with the blinkers going on. Hasn't publicly trialled, but comes to hand quickly, and bolted in on debut at home earlier in the year.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers</i>: Goulburn 4YO mare <b>3. Luxurial </b>has been in the placings around this grade for much of the year. Finished well resuming in a handy BM 50 at Queanbeyan, and only career win so far came second-up. Hawkesbury 9YO mare<b> 4. Enigimi</b> lines up for her 69th start, and has been a great money spinner for connections, with eight wins and 23 placings. Resumed with a tidy win this grade at Forbes before overwhelmed in stronger company at Muswellbrook behind Trophies Galore who then won a Highway on Hunter day at Newcastle.</p>

        <b>Odds and Evens: Split</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 5 MAIDEN PLATE (1000m)</h3>
      <p>Open sprint at set weights, with a few hopes, but 6YO Canberra mare <b>8. Brussels </b>has the potential and scope to break through fourth-up in her second prep. Finished off okay two runs back at home, before having little luck at a crucial stage at Gundagai on Snake Gully Cup day. Drawn wide, but getting to the much bigger track is a huge plus.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers</i>: Rival 3YO Canberra filly<b> 12. Disobedient</b> didn't do much as a 2YO in two runs through winter, but has ability, and leading trainer has removed the blinkers; while 3YO local filly <b>13. Rockopal</b> (Shrapnel x Rockin Along by Easy Rocking) has trialled okay, and debuts with the winkers on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Brussels to win<br/></b>
        <b>Odds and Evens: Evens</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 6 MAIDEN HCP (1400m)</h3>
      <p>Open battle. The record of 4YO local gelding <b>12. Supalux</b> doesn't look flash, but he's often had little luck, and hit the line hard in a couple of runs this prep. Draws a better barrier than his last two, and drops right down in the weights, so this is his big chance at the right journey.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers</i>: Improving 4YO Leeton gelding <b>1. Crimson Hoffa</b> hasn't been far away in all three runs this prep, and gets his chance rising in trip with the blinkers coming off. Canberra 5YO gelding<b> 3. Sugar Pine </b>showed good improvement second-up at Gundagai over this trip, and races like the long stretch here will suit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Supalux to win and box exacta 1,3,12<br/></b>
        <b>Odds and Evens: Split</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 7 CL1 HCP (1200m)</h3>
      <p>Modest race to finish augurs well for 4YO local mare<b> 5. Walingi </b>who can bounce straight back at home after not hitting the line at Gundagai. Had previously charged home to win his maiden, and draws to get plenty of cover around midfield.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers</i>: Albury 3YO colt<b> 3. Zaberfeldie </b>can pick up where he left off in June winning on debut in the heavy at home. Hasn't started since, but has looked okay at the trials, and stable places them well. Canberra 5YO mare<b> 4. Zaromatic</b> has been freshened since two fair runs this grade, but is a winner on this track and draws to get a nice trail with the blinkers going on. Hawkesbury 5YO gelding<b> 7. Bell Serenade</b> has only won one from 28, but placed eight times, and has shown marked improvement in his last two runs; while 4YO Albury gelding <b>1. Benjamery</b> is weighted to his best after one fair closing run back from a spell this track, but can improve second-up, and this isn't strong.</p>
