      <p>CALGARY -- Country music star Keith Urban is about to experience the Canadian Football League for the first time.</p>
      <p>The four-time Grammy winner is the halftime performer for Sunday's 107th Grey Cup in Calgary between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
      <p>"Having never seen a CFL game before, I'm looking forward to seeing one," Urban said Saturday at McMahon Stadium. "What a crash course right? To come and see the Grey Cup."</p>
      <p>Urban has sold more than 20 million albums, six of which have reached No. 1.</p>
      <p>Previous Grey Cup halftime performers include Alessia Cara, Shania Twain, OneRepublic, Fall Out Boy and Imagine Dragons.</p>
      <p>Urban has performed at a Nashville Predators games and at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field for the NHL Stadium Series game between the Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins in February.</p>
      <p>Born in New Zealand and raised in Australia, he's familiar with NFL football having attended a few Tennessee Titans games</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old singer-songwriter says it's a different vibe performing a few quick songs at a game where he's not primarily who people have come to see.</p>
      <p>"I never know what to expect in a situation like this," Urban said. "It's a bit like going to a festival where you don't know how many people there know who you are, what you do, have never seen you before.</p>
      <p>"But it's maybe a little harder because it's a sporting event. I always come out with the attitude that everyone is standing there doing this," he said, folding his arms in front of him. "'What do you do? What's your business?'</p>
      <p>"I want to keep everybody warm and up and motivated with hopefully songs most everyone knows.</p>
      <p>"I've got 12 minutes to do it in."</p>
      <p>Urban is familiar with Calgary having performed in the city earlier in his career, including the 2014 Calgary Stampede.</p>
      <p>"Calgary's got such a huge country fan base," Urban said. "My music certainly transcends a lot of that as well, goes outside of it a bit.</p>
      <p>"It feels like a second home, it really does Canada in general, because I started touring here so early in my career.</p>
      <p>"I could tell from when we started playing little clubs that what I was doing, everybody got it. I felt like I was back in Australia."</p>
