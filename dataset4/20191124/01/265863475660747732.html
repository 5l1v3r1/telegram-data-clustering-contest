      <h1>Lizzo Fights Back Against Social Media Troll Who Criticized Her Weight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:46:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:46</time> by <a rel="author">Todd Malm</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from PageSix.com, Lizzo recently came out to address some haters on her social media, after she shared a picture on her account and some people had a problem with it. The star dropped a nude selfie on the ‘Gram and her response to the haters was swift.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old “Truth Hurts” singer shared a photo of herself on Friday afternoon along with a caption that stated, “kiss my a**, doh!” She also added an image of <i>The Simpsons</i> protagonist, Homer Simpson. According to the Inquisitr, her post caused somewhat of a negative response from people online.</p>
      <p>Several social media commenters urged her to stop posting such pictures and adding at the same time that they had no choice but to unfollow her account. Another person added, “you can love your body without posting a**crack pictures, everything ain’t for the media.”</p>
      <p>Just a few hours before, Lizzo shared photos of her trip to Disneyland, the place where she celebrated receiving eight Grammy nominations.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Lizzo’s song, “Truth Hurts,” was on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks in a row and it became the longest-running number-one song by a female rap artist ever. Additionally, it’s the only song by a female rap artist without a feature to hold the spot.</p>

      <p>The track earned several nominations for Lizzo. Other stars who are up for awards this year include Lil Nas X, 20, and Billie Eilish, 17. Not only is Lizzo up for a number of awards, but she’s also slated to perform at the American Music Awards this Sunday.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Dick Clark Productions announced that Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Camilla Cabello, and Billie Eilish were performing at the show. Interestingly, at another point in this year, Lizzo stated that she was considering leaving the music industry. Another star to say she was bailing out of the music business was Nicki Minaj.</p>
      <p>On social media, rumor had it that the rift between herself and Cardi B played a crucial role in her claim that she was taking time off, as well as her one-sided feud with Travis Scott after <i>Astroworld </i>beat her record.</p>
