      <p>The Nigerian Army has relocated some of its units and formations located at Yaba to Epe to pave way for the expansion of the railway project in Lagos State.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reported that the units relocated were the 81 Division Base Ordinance Depot, printing press and tailoring factory.</p>
      <p>The Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen Tukur Buratai, during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction on Saturday disclosed that the relocation would lead to enhanced military presence in the area.</p>
      <p>He said, “I want to use this opportunity to appreciate the cooperation of the Minister of Transportation (Mr Rotimi Amaechi), in facilitating the prompt approval and release of funds that has made this laudable project a reality.</p>
      <p>“The minister was very supportive of the Nigerian army throughout the negotiation for the movement of this unit out of Yaba and the speedy completion of negotiations and of course the funding.”</p>
      <p>The army chief also commended Oba Kamorudeen Animashaun of Epe for his continuous support for the army in its operations and the relocation of the unit base to the area.</p>
