      <p>Louis Tomlinson is leaving the past behind in his new single, “Don’t Let It Break Your Heart,” joining his former <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/niall-horans-new-music-video-is-full-of-easter-eggs.html">One Direction</a> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-harry-styles-drops-single-watermelon-sugar-video.html">bandmates</a> in making new solo music. The singer dropped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1BJe5rmySU&amp;feature=emb_title">the new song</a> on streaming platforms this afternoon, making it the fourth single off his debut album, <i>Walls</i>. Tomlinson talked about his approach to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/one-directions-louis-tomlinson-to-release-new-solo-music.html"><i>Walls</i></a> earlier this year on <a href="https://twitter.com/Louis_Tomlinson/status/1120331682060673024">Twitter</a>, writing, “My expectations and aspirations are all shaped around my experiences. As much as I try to stay realistic I couldn’t help but crave a ‘hit’ single. It’s because of this that I’ve spent so long on this album, trying to fit into Top 40 radio when in fact maybe I should start with what I love and work from there.” <i>Walls </i>drops on January 31, 2020, which makes <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/fine-line-harry-styles-album-2019-release-date.html">this winter</a> an <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8528911/niall-horan-teases-second-solo-album">exciting one</a> for fans of the One Direction boys.</p>
