      <h1>Punter confidence at forefront of Regu-Mate, whip rule discussions</h1>

      <p>Punter confidence and the safety of his participants remains at the top of Peter V'Landys' priorities as the Racing NSW chief executive stands firm on his state's Regu-Mate rules.</p>
      <p>International pressure is mounting on Racing Australia to join the other 11 tier one racing countries in banning all products with an anabolic steroid, but the national body is yet to take a stance, leaving the door open for Racing NSW to employ rules of their own.</p>

      <p>Contrary to Racing Victoria, who has already banned the therapeutic drug which stops mares coming into season, Racing NSW will not punish positive tests that produce "inconsequential" traces of anabolic steroids.</p>
      <p>"Racing NSW has never abrogated its powers to an international organisation or organisations," V'Landys told <i>The Age</i>.</p>
      <p>"We participate in international agreements on condition they complement the Australian Rules of Racing, so that's very clear. At the moment, the Australian Rules of Racing allow the use of Regu-Mate and, if used properly, there would be no traces found whatsoever.</p>

      <p>"However, the traces are that low that they are so inconsequential that they have no effect on the horse. It's got to be remembered, we've introduced strict rules on when Regu-Mate can be used. It's got to be one clear day before a race meeting and we don't allow them to inject it."</p>
      <p>V'Landys said safety concerns and inconsistent form meant his state would take a pragmatic approach to positive tests.</p>
      <p>"From our perspective, we're not going to take a theoretical approach that everything's banned or the slightest amount causes a positive, because it's ridiculous," he said.</p>

      <p>"The most important thing for us is we're not going to jeopardise the safety of our participants or disadvantage punters over some theoretical catch-all clause when people are innocent."</p>
      <p>But Racing NSW is the outlier. Racing Queensland, which was exploring the option of adopting their own local rules similar to NSW, decided last week against releasing its Regu-Mate ban.</p>
      <p>All other states maintain a zero tolerance stance on any form of anabolic steroid.</p>
      <p>Trainer Tom Dabernig said it was time a national stance was taken.</p>
      <p>"If everyone believes it's the right thing to do, then I think you have to move with the times and adapt," he said.</p>
      <p>"There are very few substances that can be used now and everything has withholding periods, and you basically have to present your horses at the races completely drug-free, whether that's antibiotics or anything. On that basis, I think everyone's got to put it behind them and move on."</p>

      <p>Punter confidence will also need to be factored into any decisions to change the whip rule, according to Victorian Jockeys Association chief executive Matt Hyland.</p>
      <p>Hyland will be in Brisbane on Monday to meet with fellow state representatives and board directors at the Australian Jockeys Association annual general meeting, where the whip rules will be on the agenda.</p>
      <p>Hyland then plans to meet with Racing Victoria's executive general manager of integrity Jamie Stier in the next week to discuss state rules.</p>

      <p>"There's plenty of pressure on in regards to the use of the whip," Hyland said.</p>
      <p>"But there are a lot of other stakeholders that need to be consulted with it because we are a gambling industry, and the No.1 buzz word in the last couple of years has been punter confidence. That's an aspect that while it directly affects jockeys, there are punters that have got to be consulted. Should there be any changes, what does that do to punter confidence?</p>
      <p>"RV have got to get together with those stakeholder groups and ask them what their view on it is."</p>
