      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI: </b>In an alarming development, cases of cancer among children in Assam are going undetected due to lack of awareness.</p>
      <p>An oncologist at B. Borooah Cancer Institute (BBCI) said with advances, particularly in chemotherapy, many of the cancers in children have gained a remarkably high potency for cure.</p>
      <p>He, however, added that unfortunately many cases of cancer in kids go undetected in Assam because of lack of awareness about causes, symptoms and treatment of the disease.</p>
      <p>“Cancer can be hard to detect in children even by doctors on many occasions. A different set of aetiological (causing or contributing to the development of a disease or condition) factors from those commonly seen in adult cancer is responsible for cancer in children. On several occasions, children with cancer do not show any symptoms. Late detection is a key cause of cancer deaths despite the fact that child cancer is highly curable now. So we have to create massive awareness about child cancer in the State,” the oncologist said.</p>
      <p>The BBCI has detected over cases of cancer in children during the last two years. Of them, nearly 200 patients are doing well. Most of them are cases of leukaemia, lymphoma, brain tumour, retino-blastoma and bone tumour.</p>
      <p>The oncologist said age-adjusted incidence of all types of childhood cancer according to the population-based cancer registry of ICMR is the highest for boys in Chennai (159 per 10,00,000 population) followed by Delhi (149).</p>
      <p>In Aizawl, it is 97 and in urban Kamrup district, it is 62.</p>
      <p>In case of girls, incidence of all types of childhood cancer is highest in Chennai (112 per 10,00,000 population) followed by Thiruvananthapuram (103), Imphal West (67), Kamrup (metro) district (45).</p>
      <p>“Leukaemia is one of the commonest childhood malignancies, which is the highest for boys in Chennai (61 per 10,00,000) and for girls in Thiruvananthapuram (45). In Kamrup (metro) district, it is 24 for boys and 14 for girls. Similarly, lymphoma is highest for boys in Delhi and in Chennai for girls,” the oncologist said.</p>
      <p>He said while the BBCI has been conducting regular screening camps to detect cancer in children below 14 years, the government hospitals will have to come forward to do the same for early detection and treatment of the disease among kids.</p>
