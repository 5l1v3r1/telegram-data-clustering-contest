      <p>On Jan. 8, 2018, photographer Janis Wilkins returned home from an afternoon yoga class to find her Washington Heights apartment building engulfed in flames.</p>

      <p>The seven-alarm fire — caused by a faulty toaster in a neighboring unit — destroyed her rented home of 15 years. It also displaced the 63-year-old photographer for more than a year, which she spent at Hotel 17 near Union Square.</p>
      <p>Though the fire took away so much — and she unfortunately did not have renter’s insurance — in a Big Apple twist of fate, it sparked a glamorous new modeling career for Wilkins.</p>
      <p>“The fire was stimulating. I was activated [by being] in a completely different part of the city. It was freeing,” she said.</p>
      <p>A few months later, she was walking near 15th Street and Third Avenue wearing yoga clothes and — in a change — not trying to hide the white roots invading her long honey-blond mane.</p>
      <p>“I was dying my hair [at the time],” she recalled. “But it was a hot day, and I said, ‘I am going to let my white hair fly.’ ”</p>
      <p>Suddenly, she felt a tap on the shoulder. It was Daniel Peddle, a well-respected casting director who discovered Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence.</p>

      <p>“He said, ‘I’m casting [an advertising campaign for lingerie company] <a href="https://www.thirdlove.com/pages/thirdlove-soho-store?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=6444022548%7C78636652924&amp;utm_content=396508119240&amp;utm_term=thirdlove%7Ckwd-301111775012%7Cc%7C%7CEAIaIQobChMIs8n0n_eA5gIVhJyzCh2PlALHEAAYASAAEgKszPD_BwE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs8n0n_eA5gIVhJyzCh2PlALHEAAYASAAEgKszPD_BwE">ThirdLove</a> and we want women with different ages and different bodies,’” said Wilkins, who had never modeled before. “I wasn’t looking for it, but I said, ‘Sure!’ ”</p>
      <p>At the casting, potential models were asked just one question: Why do you like your body?</p>
      <p>“I said that I love my body because I am healthy,” Wilkins remembered. She landed the gig, appearing in both the brand’s commercial and in its campaign.</p>
      <p>Almost two months later, “I was driving down Broadway at night, right by the [Ed Sullivan Theater at 53rd Street] and we hit a traffic light. My friend goes, ‘Look!’ — and there was a five-story billboard on the theater. And there was my image.”</p>
      <p>This past January, she walked in her first-ever New York Fashion Week show, for the edgy brand Deveaux.</p>
      <p>“The music is blasting, and you feel like Madonna on stage,” the late bloomer said of the runway.</p>
      <p>Not bad for an ex-hippie from Flushing, Queens, as she describes herself.</p>
      <p>Wilkins, who’s not married and has no kids, briefly attended art school, lived on a commune in California, spent a year in Brazil and then programmed computers on Wall Street in the early 1990s before becoming a photographer.</p>
      <p>Now, she’s signed to Muse, a major modeling agency.</p>

      <p>Wilkins said that when she was offered the deal, “Daniel called and said, ‘This is the first time I have had a mature model sign so quickly.’ I thought it was an April Fool’s joke.”</p>
      <p>She has since posed for the clothing brand Universal Standard, walked in a Studio 189 show and modeled for the November issue of Allure magazine. And she was happy to show off glitzy holidaywear in a photo shoot for The Post, at Butterfly bar and lounge in Soho.</p>
      <p>“Wearing that maroon velvet suit, I felt just like Catherine Deneuve,” Wilkins said.</p>
      <p>She chalks up her outer beauty to a mainly vegetarian diet, yoga, argan oil on her face and a little bit of mascara and lipstick. She doesn’t wear foundation or facial makeup.</p>
      <p>As for her inner well-being, Wilkins meditates and said she’s healthier after learning to not take anything personally. She also speaks Spanish and Portuguese, regularly working on her grammar to keep sharp: “Speaking other languages helps when you are older because it keeps the neurons developing,” she explained.</p>
      <p>And then there’s her hair — which she is finally letting go its natural color.</p>
      <p>“I now love celebrating white hair,” said Wilkins of her new look and new life. “It’s so liberating to not have to deal with hair dye.”</p>
      <p>Last month she moved back into her renovated uptown apartment. She is now unpacking and rearranging her favorite old belongings to fit her new life.</p>
      <p>“For me, the fire wasn’t terrible. It was shocking, but it’s not cancer,” said Wilkins. “I am grateful that now I have this new career after it.</p>
      <p>“This whole thing has reminded me to trust the universe.”</p>
