      <h1>Bellator London results: Michael 'Venom' Page makes quick work of Giovanni Melillo with first-round KO</h1>

      <p>Michael "Venom" Page was guilty of window shopping and looking ahead to running it back against Douglas Lima â€” and it didn't matter at all.</p>
      <p>MVP blasted Giovanni Melillo with a hard right hand to score another highlight-reel knockout in the main event of Bellator London at theSSE Arena on Saturday, before calling out the welterweight champion for a rematch. Lima handed Page his first pro loss last Maywhen he slept MVP with a right uppercut.</p>

      <p>"Who wants to see me fight Douglas Lima again?" Page asked in the cage following his victory. "He's got the belt, I got a lot of respect for him, but I want to take something back that he stole from me."</p>
      <p>Lima was tuning in, but apparently he wants to see more from Page before granting him a crack at redemption.</p>

      <p>Just as Page made the mistake of gambling against Lima,Melilloerrantly went for a right head kick. Page, almost simultaneously, detonated that right hand, knocking out the overmatchedMelilloin devastating fashion. Page knew it was over, too, as he instantly struck his venomous snake pose in the center of the cage.</p>

      <p>That's two consecutive first-round victories for MVP since his knockout loss to Lima. He defeatedRichard Kiely with a flying knee in September.</p>
