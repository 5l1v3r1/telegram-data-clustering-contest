        <b>GameCentral readers reveal their favourites out of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo and whether they consider themselves loyal fans or not.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The subject for this week’s Hot Topic was suggested by reader Xane, who asks whether you always buy consoles made by the same company or if you’re happy to switch loyalties as the situation demands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Most people admitted they had a preference, but most also claimed they had no problem changing formats if they thought the grass was greener elsewhere. Although many suggested they would switch to Sega instantly if they re-entered the console business.</b>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Reliable provider</b><br/>I’ve been buying almost nothing but PlayStation consoles since the first one came out. The third was a bit of a letdown but other than that they’ve barely put a foot wrong as far as I’m concerned. I bought an Xbox 360 to make up for the PlayStation 3 and have more recently got a Switch, which I enjoy, but other than that PlayStation consoles, including the portables, have covered my every gaming need.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>I’m not sure if that counts as loyalty exactly, just my needs being catered to as I find a reliable company to provide what I need. But if someone else was doing something better I’d swap over. Or buy that as well if I can afford it.</p>
      <p>The problem for other companies is that both Microsoft and Nintendo have made bad consoles that have had serious problems and been relative flops, whereas Sony never has. The PlayStation 3 was the closest they got and it wasn’t that bad and still outsold Xbox 360 anyway.<br/><b>Gossem</b></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Voice of experience</b><br/>For me it’s always Nintendo. I’ll buy Sony or Microsoft consoles but they’re just interchangeable to me. Their consoles are always almost identical and most of their games, bar a few Sony exclusives, are the same too. But Nintendo… everything they do is so full of life and imagination. Even their failures are interesting and their priority is always entertainment, not technology or storytelling or any other nonsense that distracts from being a game.</p>
      <p>I’m not blind to their failures – the Wii U was a real test of my so-called loyalty – but even that had some great games that would be impossible anywhere else, including the Switch (I swear Nintendo Land is an unappreciated classic).</p>
      <p>So yeah, anything Nintendo does is automatically of interest to me. I won’t buy anything they do just blindly but experience tells me I’ll probably like it anyway.<br/><b>Lorn</b></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Obvious transition</b><br/>I’m not sure if loyalty is quite the word but after this generation I would find it very surprising if I didn’t get the PlayStation 5 as my first, and possibly only console. Mind you I said something similar about the Xbox 360 to Xbox One transition and look how that turned out.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It really is unbelievable how much Microsoft messed up this generation, not just in terms of the console itself and all the DRM and everything but just the utterly terrible first party games. I mean, what’s their best? Does Ori And The Blind Forest even count?</p>
      <p>Sony though have quietly got on with things, producing great games and not making any major mistakes. Add in backwards compatibility to the next gen and I’m pretty much sold. The only way I possibly see Microsoft getting back in is if Project xCloud/Game Pass is massively better than Sony’s streaming service. That’s possible, but I’m not putting a bet on it.<br/><b>Jay</b></p>

      <p><b>Dreamcast too</b><br/>Can’t say I have much in the way of brand loyalty – not even to Nintendo, whose games are and always will be worth a look. I switched from Microsoft’s Xbox 360 to Sony’s PlayStation 4 this generation, my main concerns being value for money. That said, Microsoft clearly provide a better online service, but oh well.</p>
      <p>Microsoft will need to tempt me with better exclusives. Imaginative, fantastical stuff. In short, they need Fable. They need it to be amazing and they need more like it too.</p>
      <p>But, there is one company I would follow no matter what. If Sega were to produce a new console, then I would buy it yesterday. Oh gods, yes. Just even the faintest, vaguest whiff of a possibility of there being a return to Dreamcast days of old Sega creativity would have me sign up at whatever the asking price. And hey, at least Capcom would support it! They always seem to support a Sega console. I don’t know why? Do they have a sentimental streak?</p>

      <p>And besides, we need more games that say: ‘Se-gaaaaa!’ at the beginning. We just do.<br/><b>DMR</b></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Favourite software</b><br/>I don’t have a favourite console maker, but I have favourite games from each of the console manufacturers; Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony. Every generation since the PlayStation 3 I have bought all of the main consoles and handhelds, as I like to be able to pick a game I like the sound of from reviews on GameCentral, Edge, and Eurogamer or have liked from previous entries in a series and play it.</p>
      <p>I can pick up any DVD and play it on a DVD player and I like to be able to pick up any game I am interested in within a budget for the three consoles. When a new generation starts I buy the consoles over a two or three (or four) year period so I don’t get them all at once, can’t afford that!</p>
      <p>When I was at school I had a Game Boy and Mega Drive only, so when the next generation came out, not having a lot of money, I got the Sega Saturn only and enjoyed the games a lot on it. I was sad when Sega came out of the hardware market, after the failure of the Dreamcast, as I loved their games on Saturn or Dreamcast games like Daytona USA, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Manx TT, NiGHTS, Virtua Cop 1 and 2 with lightgun, Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Shenmue, and Metropolis Street Racer.</p>
      <p>As Sega don’t make a lot of varied games now, apart from strategy games and the odd remaster/remake, I miss all their creations. Since PlayStation 3 I have become a fan of Naughty Dog games, so I usually buy the PlayStation console first in a new generation but I don’t normally buy it launch day because of price and if there are any hardware problems.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Later on I would go on and buy a Xbox or Nintendo console. I play single-player games mostly, so have enjoyed the exclusives on PlayStation 3/4 as well as the Xbox and Nintendo. I have bought some handheld consoles on day of release, as they are usually cheaper than launch day console prices.</p>
      <p>Although I did not buy a PS Vita on launch day, as I had a PSP launch day and I realised that although the PSP was great the Vita would probably have the same problems with support the PSP had. With the Xbox 360 generation I did buy that before a PlayStation 3, as I liked the look of the exclusive games on it at, compared to the PlayStation 3 launch.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of Xbox 360 generation I liked a lot of the PlayStation 3 exclusives so that is why I got the PlayStation 4 first over the Xbox One.<br/><b>Andrew J.</b></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Unique experience</b><br/>I’d say the only true brand loyalty I’ve ever had in gaming was with Sega, from getting a Mega Drive on my 12th birthday. I’d missed the 8-bit consoles by having a Commodore 16 then 64+, I always stuck with Sega until the demise of the Dreamcast, which still remains my favourite ever piece of gaming hardware. This probably explains my relative apathy with the Mario, Zelda, Metroid, etc. franchises – some of which I’ve played over three decades and sometimes enjoyed yet never loved.</p>
      <p>Since then I’ve owned pretty much all the consoles at various points, every PlayStation, every Xbox, I missed both the Wiis out of choice but had the GameCube and Switch; the former I loved and the latter I soon got rid of.</p>
      <p>I’ve much preferred Sony’s offering this generation but put more time into the Xbox 360 last gen, before that the GameCube was my main console, mostly in part to the Resident Evil exclusives and Dreamcast ports. Before that it was the PlayStation 1 and Dreamcast, so I never really build up a loyalty to one company, mainly gravitating towards whichever console has the best selection of games at the time or whichever one really clicks with me.</p>
      <p>However, as a relatively late adopter of the Xbox this gen, I think I’m going to buy the Scarlett or whatever it’s eventually called next gen first. I’ve loved a lot of the games on PlayStation 4 this gen, but the console itself has let me down. I’ve had so many issues of crashing, closedowns, and freezing almost on a daily basis with two PlayStation 4s (Slim and Pro), and the noise! It drives me round the twist, I half expect my PlayStation 4 to suddenly explode or take off whenever playing a technically complex game, even watching YouTube sometimes sets the thing into hyper mode despite me cleaning out the fans fortnightly.</p>
      <p>The Xbox in comparison is silent and has been since I purchased it, despite being a preowned first gen bog standard Xbox One. For extra context my Xbox has never crashed or frozen either, yet I almost feel like the error report page on the PlayStation 4 is my most viewed thing this gen. I’m pig sick of being warned NOT to turn my PlayStation off when logging back in after a freeze, when I’ve had no other option but to pull the plug. Something as simple as browsing the PS Store, or checking the BBC boxing page, it’ll freeze completely and stay that way ’til powered off.</p>
      <p>I also love Games Pass, compared to PS Now which is pretty dire, although it has gotten better the past few months they’re poles apart in content and price. Sony just seems to lump random old games on Now for a brief period, where on Xbox you can play brand new titles. I don’t play many games online but if I do, I also notice the quality difference between PSN and Xbox Live.</p>
      <p>I’ll own both big consoles next gen, I always do end up with both eventually, when I’ve exhausted most of the library on one platform, but I’ve already made my mind when the new ones eventually drop, the new Xbox will be my first step into the new generation. I won’t need to buy a huge amount of games as Games Pass will have me covered for things I’m interested enough to try but not buy, and I’ll hopefully not have to contend with constant freezing and jet engine noise.</p>
      <p>I’m also helped in this choice by the fact I’m not particularly fussed about a lot of Sony exclusives so won’t miss most of them; Yakuza aside, and they’ll be there for cheap when I eventually get a PlayStation 5 as well as being able to play my library of boxed PlayStation 4 games – supposedly anyway, although I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Sony not include the backwards compatibility. The rumours of a proprietary SSD/cartridge fills me with dread too, as a PS Vita owner I’m well aware how greedy Sony can get when they think they’ll get away with it and still have the now useless cards to prove it.</p>
      <p>This all would of course change in an instant if Sega announced a Dreamcast 2 out of the blue, but there’s more chance of Keith Apicary winning Miss World than that happening.</p>
      <p>One thing I know for sure I won’t be investing in is Stadia, I still buy the majority of my games physically, and I keep all of them, so Google’s offering was DOA for me. Nintendo is never in picture for me either unless they released a GameCube-esque offering without silly gimmicks, just a pure gaming machine on par with the competition rather than being a second/third option to a proper console but even then, the extortionate price of games on Nintendo platforms always puts me off.</p>
      <p>Seeing Cat Quest go on sale for £30 still baffles me to this day, the fact they generally keep their trade-in value is lost on me as I keep all my games, so being a Nintendo-mainer would be very expensive and to be brutally honest, quite boring as they never have more than half a dozen games worth playing that aren’t available elsewhere better optimised and much, much cheaper.<br/><b>Lost-Sock-</b></p>

      <p><b>Reliable choices</b><br/>I used to be a Nintendo fan through and through, from the 16-bit era to the GameCube era. The Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2 took over, with the PlayStation 3 after that. Around a couple or so years later I bought a non-Red Ring of Death Xbox 360 and then a PlayStation 4. Then a Game Boy Advance SP and Nintendo DS also!</p>
      <p>But it’s not as easy as that, as GC says it’s games that sell consoles, but also reliability. Sony showed their machine was worthy of purchase with Final Fantasy 7, etc. and the Resident Evil series, plus a whole bunch of other top titles. By then Nintendo had been beaten by titles which I wanted to play more – or alongside Nintendo’s platforms at least.</p>
      <p>This continued with the PlayStation 2, with probably my favourite era of games, with so many top titles like Persona 4, the Metal Gear series, and Medal of Honor, etc. that I did not have time for any other titles on the Nintendo consoles.</p>
      <p>Now the PlayStation 3 came and I thought this may continue the PlayStation 2 legacy and yes it did, but not with a dominating stance. Hidden in the background Microsoft came along with a new lead format called the Xbox 360. After the end of the Red Ring of Death fiasco this console clearly ran games better than the PlayStation 3, with a better frame rate and cleaner graphics – just in time for Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim. The difference was incredible as Fallout 3 on the PlayStation 3 was so noticeably inferior it was ridiculous.</p>
      <p>The PlayStation 4 made up for second place in the race with the PlayStation 3 as the diabolical release of the Xbox One, with its very negative press and consumer reactions, really helped PlayStation 4 became the lead format. And as for the game performances – perfect with no inferior frame rates and graphical glitches to be seen.</p>
      <p>Oh yes and what about Nintendo, did I ever go back? Well, sorry to say no. Ironically though Nintendo are currently, for the last couple of years, producing so many good titles and with the Switch being such a good console, I feel as though Nintendo is temping me back into the fold. If it does, I will always have a PlayStation 5 or maybe the next Microsoft console due to the games being so different and pretty much why I play games at the moment. You won’t get Cyberpunk 2077 or Final Fantasy 7 Remake on the Switch just yet, if ever.</p>
      <p>So there it is, Sony is currently my interest but the future could change it to another console manufacturer, and it would all be for the performance and reliability issues, plus a whole bunch of top notch game releases, of course.<br/><b>Alucard</b></p>
