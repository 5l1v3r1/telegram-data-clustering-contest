      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> said he’d returned to his ‘natural habitat’ after admitting he found it difficult during his stint away from management since his departure from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old was sacked by the Red Devils last December after the club suffered their worst start to a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> season in 28 years and he’s watched on enviously during his 11 months out of the game.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was back on the touchline on Saturday and was delighted to kick-start a new era at Tottenham with a 3-2 victory against London rivals West Ham, their first away league win since January.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese spent part of his time away from the game serving as a pundit for SkySports and Mourinho was in a reflective mood after the game, admitting he found it difficult to be watch on from the outside.</p>

      <p>‘To confess, the most difficult moments for me in the last 11 months were the parts of the summer where I didn’t have a pre-season and I was looking at other managers and clubs doing pre-season,’ said Mourinho.</p>

      <p>‘The weirdest feeling was when I was going to football stadiums, sometimes I was thinking what am I doing here? In the box or in the Sky studio, what am I doing here? The most weird feeling.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Mourinho revealed he had ‘lost his passion’ at the end of his time in Manchester but appeared a much happier figure after Tottenham’s win at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>‘I belong out there [in the technical area] so today I was where I belong. That’s my natural habitat.</p>
      <p>‘Was I extra emotional? No. Was I nervous? No, but I just love it, especially when things go in your direction, of course the best thing in football is to win matches.’</p>
