      <p>But did you know that eating the right fruits every day can help you maintain your weight? Yes, you read that right. Four servings of the right fruit every day can help you shed those extra kilos. Here’s a list of five fruits you need to eat daily to maintain your weight.</p>
      <p>Blueberries</p>
      <p>A study conducted by the British Medical Journal including 1,00,000 men and women found that blueberries have antioxidants flavanols, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins and flavonoid polymers, which may help prevent weight gain.</p>
      <p>One cup of blueberries have around 10 milligrams of anthocyanins. Berries are among the most filling fruits and you can include a cup of them in your daily diet to maintain your weight and health.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Apples</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apples are full of fibre and rich in flavonoid polymers, which make them the perfect <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss">weight loss</a> fruit. Eat your apple with the skin to get more fibre, antioxidants and control blood sugar effectively. Controlled blood sugar helps in keeping the food cravings at bay and protects you against diabetes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pears</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the study published in the British Medical Journal, pears may prevent weight gain as they are rich in flavonoid polymers. Every 138 mg of extra flavonoid polymers result in less weight gain. Thus, fruits rich in flavonoid antioxidants are a great choice for weight watchers and everyone in general. The fibre in the skin keeps you fuller for longer and prevents you from binge eating.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Strawberries</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just like blueberries, strawberries are also rich in anthocyanins and thus can help keep your weight in check. People think that because fruits are sweet they can lead to weight gain. But fruits like pear, apple and berries are not just less sweet but also have a high flavonoid content, which makes them the best fruits for weight management.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Peppers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, peppers are fruits. If consumed daily, peppers can help keep your weight in check. Capsaicin in chilli peppers encourage the white cell to convert the energy-burning brown fat, says a study conducted on rats.</p>
