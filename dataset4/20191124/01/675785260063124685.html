      <p>A British cruise pensioner jailed for trying to smuggle cocaine has been rushed to hospital for a heart scan.</p>
      <p>Roger Clarke, 72, and wife Susan, 71, are serving eight years in a Portuguese prison after they were busted by the police with £1 million worth of Class A drug on a luxury Caribbean liner.</p>
      <p>Retired chef Clarke has reportedly lost around six stone since his arrest a year ago and needed an electrocardiogram test.</p>
      <p>A source said the health scare meant he had to leave a meeting with wife Susan, who had not seen for nine weeks.</p>
      <p>The source added: "By the time he got back all he saw was his wife sobbing her heart out and there's nothing he could do."</p>
      <p>Last month, Clarke spoke to the Sunday Mirror that his health has waned since being locked up in EP Lisboa jail.</p>

      <p>He said: "I have a heart condition and had stents fitted in 2010. I was rushed to hospital with a suspected heart attack here.</p>
      <p>"It turned out to be something to do with my chest muscles as I have lost nearly six stone."</p>
      <p>The pensioner was desperate for prime minister Boris Johnson's help.</p>
      <p>He said: "I have sent a letter to the PM asking him to look into our case.</p>
      <p>"My wife and I are completely innocent and have fallen victims to cruel drug smugglers.</p>

      <p>"I've learnt from other inmates some very interesting, nasty stories about drugs being taken into the UK."</p>
      <p>They were arrested on the Marco Polo cruise ship on December 4, 2018.</p>
      <p>Officers discovered nine kilos of cocaine hidden inside the lining of four suitcases. </p>
      <p>Clarke claimed that he had been handed the cases in St Lucia and had no idea they contained the Class A drugs.</p>
      <p>He complained of his single cell in EP Lisboa jail: "The conditions here are really disgusting, no air conditioning, no heating and in many cells not even any lighting.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been a little lucky as I’m now on F wing which has single cells with a shower and toilet, mind you it’s pot luck if and when you get hot water.</p>
      <p>"Rats are a menace, some are as large as rabbits, cockroaches by the millions and all sorts of other horrible bugs.</p>
      <p>"F wing is where anyone from another country, such as embassy people, are shown which is why it’s kept a lot cleaner than other wings."</p>
