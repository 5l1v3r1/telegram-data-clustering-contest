      <p>Senators across party divides on Friday expressed confidence that the Constituency Development Project Bill before the National Assembly would put an end to the age-long blackmail of the legislative arm of government.</p>
      <p>The federal lawmakers, who spoke with our correspondent on and off the record on the issue insisted that the executive arm of government should be held responsible for the failure of the programme from achieving its desired objectives.</p>
      <p>They maintained the executive arm of government should be blamed for the poor release of funds, poor project execution and outright misappropriation of the money meant for the execution of constituency projects.</p>
      <p>A principal officer of the Senate, who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said rather than blame the lawmakers for the abysmal performance of the programme over the years, anti-corruption agencies should have been invited to probe it.</p>
      <p>He said, “The lawmakers only recommend projects to be included in the capital component of the budget based on the needs of their constituents and the amount of money allocated to them.</p>
      <p>“The blackmail against the legislature should stop. President Muhammadu Buhari should, as a matter of urgency, commence the investigation of his cabinet members and heads of federal agencies to actually discover why the constituency projects programme had failed.”</p>
      <p>Another senator from the South-West who also pleaded to remain anonymous alleged that top government functionaries heading agencies determined how the funds for constituency projects were spent.</p>
      <p>He said,  “There was a case of a senator who volunteered to spend the entire N300m allocated to his constituency to equip a Federal Government medical institution in his area. The money was released but the Minister of Health diverted it to his home state.</p>
      <p>“All these are happening because there is no law to guide against such diversion and other issues causing the failure of the programme.</p>
      <p>“We are ready to support and pass the recently introduced constituency projects bill so that there would be even development across the country.”</p>
      <p>A former Senate Leader, Ali Ndume, also told our correspondent that the Constituency Development Fund Bill, sponsored by him, which passed first reading last week, would address the issues being raised against the programme.</p>
      <p>He said, “Money is usually allocated for constituency projects but there is usually no clear operational guidelines to ensure the implementation.</p>
      <p>“There must be a law to determine where the funds for the execution of the projects would come from and who would be responsible for the execution.</p>
      <p>“The constituency projects are scattered all over the ministries, departments and agencies of government, hence they are very difficult to track by the relevant government agencies.</p>
      <p>“There is the need for the projects to be harmonised under one agency for easy monitoring, funding and execution. That is what my bill would address.</p>
      <p>“The idea behind the constituency projects is to have Federal Government presence in every nook and cranny of the country and it should not be allowed to die,” Ndume said.</p>
      <p>President Buhari had during the week hit the National Assembly for not having anything to show for the N1trn budgeted for constituency projects in the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>But the opposition senators said they were not bothered by Buhari’s statement which they described as erroneous.</p>
