      <p>Employee 'A' took 1,200,000 KRW (approximately 1016 USD) from <b>Wooyeop</b> over the past two years, and have not paid him back. An anonymous 'B' told <b>Sports World</b> that 'A' took money from Wooyeop since he was 17. He was the only <b>TRCNG</b> member not from Seoul, so his parents always gave him cash whenever he came home. 'A' waited for whenever Wooyeop came back from visiting his home, and borrowed money. Whenever Wooyeop refused to give 'A' money, he was singled out for harder practice, and other employees were instructed to torment Wooyeop. </p>
