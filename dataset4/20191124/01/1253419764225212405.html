      <h1>This Half-Life mod re-imagines and revamps its scrapped 1997 version, available for download</h1>

      <p>Half-Life fans, here is something for you today. Jackathan has released the first version of In Deep; a mod that re-imagines and revamps the scrapped 1997 version of Half-Life.</p>
      <p>This first release features the entire “Office Warrens” chapter from the Half-Life 0.52 Alpha. Jackathan has remade this chapter from scratch, which also comes with improved puzzles and gameplay.</p>
      <p>As Jackathan noted, this isn’t a 1-1 remake of the cancelled “Office Warrens” chapter. Still, it does not stray too far from the original’s designs and layouts.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, In Deep’s Office Warrens is a less linear and somewhat extended version of Office Complex from retail Half-Life. It’s a cool concept, and you can download the mod from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-in-deep/downloads/office-warrens-demo">here</a>.</p>
      <p>I also suggest trying the <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/this-mod-allows-you-to-play-the-half-life-campaign-in-co-op-mode-available-for-download/">co-op mod for Half-Life</a>. That mod lets you play the entire single-player campaign in co-op mode, so be sure to also give it a go.</p>
      <p>Have fun!</p>
