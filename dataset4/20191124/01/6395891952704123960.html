      <p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/breaking-ksu-women-basketball-player-arrested-murder-charges/WR8aRO7P50bQpu2Xl4yEZL/">Kamiyah Street was arrested Thursday on eight counts</a>, including murder, three counts of felony murder, criminal attempt to commit armed robbery, two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, Fulton County jail records show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/breaking-ksu-women-basketball-player-arrested-murder-charges/WR8aRO7P50bQpu2Xl4yEZL/">Atlanta police confirmed they charged Street</a> for her alleged role in the July 16 shooting death of a man whose body was discovered in the parking deck of the Heritage Station apartments on McDaniel Street. </p>
      <p>Investigators at the scene determined that 21-year-old Nashiem Hubbard-Etienne was "the victim of a targeted shooting," Atlanta police spokesman James White said.</p>
      <p>Additional details about the case weren't immediately available Saturday evening, and police said the homicide investigation is ongoing.</p>
      <p>David Beall, KSU's assistant athletic director for communications, told AJC.com the team was made aware of the charges against Street on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>"The individual has been suspended indefinitely from all women's basketball team and athletic activities," he said. "Neither the university nor the athletic department have any additional information at this time."</p>
      <p>Street, a junior who graduated from Mays High School in Atlanta, averaged 21 points and five rebounds through the team's first four games of the season. At 37 minutes per game, only one other player on her team saw more time on the court. </p>
