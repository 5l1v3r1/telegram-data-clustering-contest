      <p>OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, who has been in the job for four days, said on Saturday he had pressed his Chinese counterpart about the case of two Canadian citizens jailed in Beijing.</p>
      <p>China says the two men are being held on state secrets charges. They were detained last December, shortly after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.</p>
      <p>Champagne, named to his post in a cabinet shuffle on Wednesday, said he had raised the matter when he met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for almost an hour on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Nagoya, Japan.</p>
      <p>"In particular I expressed my concern and the concern of all Canadians regarding the conditions of their detention. Mr Wang and I committed to ... continue discussing this issue," Champagne told reporters on a conference call from Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Canadian diplomats make regular consular visits to the two men, neither of whom has yet been allowed to see a lawyer.</p>
      <p>Champagne declined to give details of what he called a good, frank and substantive conversation with Wang, saying that would not be in the detainees' interests.</p>
      <p>"There was receptivity of the concern of Canada," said Champagne, who spoke in English.</p>
      <p>The meeting was the first between the two countries' top diplomats since Wang met Chrystia Freeland, Champagne's predecessor, in August this year.</p>
      <p>China's new ambassador to Ottawa on Friday repeated a demand that Canada immediately release Meng, who is the daughter of the Huawei founder. China has also blocked imports of canola seed from Canada.</p>
