      <p>A Queensland mother has been charged with murder after her two daughters were found dead inside an airless vehicle.</p>

      <p>Reports from local media claim the panicked mother attempted to splash water on the toddlers before police and paramedics arrived at the scene shortly after 1:30pm (local time). </p>
      <p>The car was reportedly parked in front of the family's Waterford West property, the outside temperature surpassing 30 degrees on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The mother, 27, has been charged with two counts of murder and will appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Neighbours told the <i>Sunday Mail</i> they believed the girls had been in the car at roughly 6.30am - seven hours before they were pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>The community is struggling to come to terms with the incident.</p>
      <p>"It just makes you think that if you'd walked down maybe half an hour earlier, you could have saved those kids," one neighbour told the outlet.</p>
      <p>"It's a very tragic incident," said Detective Inspector Mark White from the Logan Child Protection and Investigation Unit.</p>
      <p>"We are putting a lot of emphasis on supporting our people."</p>
