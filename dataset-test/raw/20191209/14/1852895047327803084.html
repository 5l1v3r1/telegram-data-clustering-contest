      <h4>Cardi B is kicking off 2020 on the cover of ‘Vogue’s January issue with her 17-month-old daughter, Kulture! The rapper is stunning in a red dress with white polka dots, while holding and her baby girl who’s pictured smiling in a pair of little red shorts!</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/cardi-b/"><b>Cardi B</b></a> is “unfiltered, unapologetic, and unbowed” in her new cover interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/cardi-b-cover-january-2020"><i>Vogue</i></a>. The rapper, 27, covers the magazine’s January 2020 issue — which celebrates four fearless creative forces, role models, and mothers with a quartet of covers — alongside her 17-month-old daughter <b>Kulture Kiari Cephus</b>. The mother daughter duo are the ultimate pair in a series of photos, one of which shows Cardi holding Kulture close with a New York City skyline behind them.</p>
      <p>Cardi opens up about motherhood, a new album, the scrutiny of ever-escalating fame and her marriage to <b>Migos</b> rapper, <b>Offset</b> in the candid interview. She goes on to explain that motherhood has allowed her to be more focused and less concerned with any negative outside noise. “Being a mom — how can I say it? Things are a little bit harder to balance, but it’s good for the mental,” she explained. “Like, if I’m playing with my daughter, I forget about the issues.”</p>
