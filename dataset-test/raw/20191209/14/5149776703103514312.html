      <h1>Tobacco stolen from Booker Cash and Carry was a 'gift for a friend'</h1>
      <h2>'He realises it was a stupid thing'</h2>

      <p>A man tried to steal tobacco as a gift for a friend who offers him free board.</p>
      <p>But the £200 haul was found on Arian Rahimi and he was brought to Nottingham Magistrates' Court.</p>
      <p>That led to a one-year conditional discharge for Rahimi, 34, of Hartley Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/radford">Radford</a> .</p>
      <p>He must pay £85 prosecution costs and a £21 government surcharge.</p>
      <p>Bill Soughton, mitigating, said that he has been in the UK for a decade and has never been in trouble before.</p>
      <p>As an asylum seeker, he is not allowed to work and has spent eight years awaiting an interview for permission to be permitted to remain here.</p>
      <p>A friend runs a restaurant and car wash. He has provided a home for Rahimi.</p>
      <p>Mr Soughton told the court: "He smokes and finds it difficult to give it up.</p>
      <p>"He also wanted to give his friend a present for looking after him so well. He realises it was a stupid thing," he told District Judge Leo Pyle.</p>
      <p>Lee Shepherd, prosecuting, said that the offence took place at the Booker Cash and Carry on The Midway, Lenton industrial estate, on Saturday, December 7.</p>
      <p>Security staff used CCTV to watch two men who took items from a shelf.</p>
      <p>Rahimi seemed to be hiding some tobacco products, which were recovered. He refused to answer questions when detained by police officers and the second suspect managed to run away.</p>
      <p>Rahimi admitted theft and must pay the court bill at a rate of £10 a fortnight.</p>
      <p>The judge told him: "If you commit another offence in a year, you will be re-sentenced for this."</p>
