      <p>BRUSSELS, Dec 9 — Luxembourg’s veteran foreign minister has written to the new head of European Union foreign policy to urge a debate on recognising Palestinian statehood.</p>
      <p>In a note to Josep Borrell, who took office last week as Brussels’ chief diplomat, Jean Asselborn said a discussion could support efforts to find a “two-state” solution to the Middle East conflict.</p>
      <p>The letter, seen by AFP today during an EU foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels, suggests that member states could debate recognition at a future similar get-together.</p>
      <p>Any decision on establishing diplomatic relations with a new state would be taken by individual member states, but Asselborn wants to at least discuss it at EU level.  </p>
      <p>“The European Union must continue to promote and support the consensus in favour of the two-State solution,” Asselborn write to Borrell, who was Spain’s foreign minister before moving to Brussels.</p>
      <p>“One way to help save this solution would be to create a more equitable situation for both parties.</p>
      <p>“In this regard, I believe that it is time to start a debate within the European Union on the opportunity of a recognition of the State of Palestine by all its Member States.”</p>
      <p>Israel and its ally the United States oppose the recognition of Palestine as a state, arguing that this would prejudice efforts to find a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.</p>
      <p>But, to some European capitals, Washington has already put its finger on the scales by recognising the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and by moving its embassy there.</p>
      <p>In his letter, Asselborn complains that Israel’s building of settlements on occupied land also endangers the peace process and is a “flagrant violation” of international law.</p>
      <p>“The recognition of Palestine as a State would neither be a favour, nor a blank cheque, but a simple recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to their own State,” he argued. </p>
      <p>“In no way would it be directed against Israel.”</p>
      <p>There is sympathy for this position in Europe, but the EU has not taken a united position on Palestinian statehood, regarding it as an issue for member states. — AFP<br/> </p>
