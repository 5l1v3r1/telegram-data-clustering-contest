      <p>It’s titled <i>The Great Adventour: Live in Brno 2019</i> and it’ll arrive on March 6. It was captured in the Czech Republic on the band’s European tour in support of <i>The Great Adventure</i> album, which came out earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The live package will be released as a 2CD/2Blu-ray Digipak via InsideOut Music after Morse, Mike Portnoy, Randy George, Bill Hubauer and Eric Gillette re-signed with the label.</p>
      <p>Morse says: “The band and myself are super excited to be back with our friends at InsideOut. They are great people and I’m sure it will be a fruitful relationship as it always has been.” </p>
      <p>InsideOutMusic label-head Thomas Waber adds: "There is obviously a lot of history between Neal and InsideOutMusic and we are ready to make more history with one of the most important prog artists of our generation.”</p>
      <p>Along with the music, <i>The Great Adventour: Live in Brno 2019</i> will include two tour documentaries from both the US and the European runs, along with the official music videos for the singles taken from <i>The Great Adventure</i>.</p>
      <p>Bassist George says: “This was our first time playing in the Czech Republic and this venue had a different look and vibe: the audience also turned out to be very energetic. They loved it!”</p>
