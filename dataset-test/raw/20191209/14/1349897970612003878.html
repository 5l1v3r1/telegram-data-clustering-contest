      </ul>
      <p>Inter Milan defender Diego Godin says his team are not expecting an easy ride against a Barcelona side who have already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League. </p>
      <p>The Serie A giants must better Borussia Dortmund's result against Slavia Prague when they face Barça on Tuesday if they want to reach the knockout rounds. </p>
      <p>Barça are already through as group winners and have taken advantage of their situation to rest Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique and Sergi Roberto for the trip to Milan. </p>
      <p>“The objective is the match tomorrow, we don’t think beyond that," Godin told reporters on Monday. "Barcelona are one of the best teams in the world, always winning at least one trophy every season.</p>
      <p>“There’s enthusiasm. It is up to us to qualify from the group, we have to make our fans proud and give everything we’ve got. We have to do that to qualify against a team that are used to getting deep into the tournament. It doesn’t matter if they are already qualified.&amp;rdquor;</p>
      <p>Godin also spoke about striker Lautaro Martinez, whose form this season has seen him linked with a move to Barça as a long-term replacement for Luis Suarez. </p>
      <p>“Lautaro has grown so much, he is about to explode,&amp;rdquor; Godin added. “He feels really important and is physically very strong.</p>
      <p>“If he is on the lips of the big clubs, it’s because he is demonstrating that he deserves to be. Today, he’s at Inter and I’m happy he’s here us to help us win. He can still grow and improve. I hope can continue to help us with goals and push the team on in general.&amp;rdquor;</p>
