      <p>Ahead of Inter Milan and Barca's clash in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday night, <i>Sport</i> have reported that Lautaro Martinez's agents, Beto Yaque and Rolando Zarate, will be in Milan for the game.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed they will make the most of Barca's visit to discuss a potential move for their client, who has been in terrific form for Inter since manager Antonio Conte's arrival at the club.</p>
      <p>At the same time, it is believed Blaugrana sporting director Eric Abidal will also be present in Milan, and that Martinez's agents plan to meet with him this week.</p>

      <p>The forward, 22, has previously been linked with the Spanish giants, but his impressive first half of the 2019/20 campaign has reportedly seen a few clubs step up their interest in him.</p>
      <p>It has been said that Inter want to offer the Argentina international a new deal that would expire in 2023, but his agents reportedly have no intention of discussing a contract renewal at this point.</p>
      <p>Martinez has lined up alongside Messi for his national team, and the pair appear to have struck a healthy connection early on.</p>
