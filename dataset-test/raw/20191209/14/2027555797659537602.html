      <h1>Sri Lanka arrive for first Test in Pakistan since 2009</h1>

      <p>Sri Lanka arrived for the first Test cricket tour of Pakistan in 10 years on Monday following the deadly 2009 attack on their team that plunged Pakistan into sporting isolation.</p>
      <p>"The arrival of Sri Lankan team is a historic occasion and we are delighted to host the two-match Test series starting from Wednesday," said Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Waseem Khan.</p>
      <p>The first Test starts in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Wednesday, while the second begins in Karachi on December 19.</p>
      <p>A video tweeted by the PCB showed the Sri Lankan team arriving in Islamabad and being escorted by armed security forces.</p>
      <p>The tour marks the return of Test cricket to Pakistan after a decade of isolation triggered by the attack in Lahore, which killed eight people and wounded several cricketers.</p>
      <p>For years, Pakistan has been forced to play all its home matches in neutral venue the United Arab Emirates as foreign teams refused to tour the country over security fears.</p>
      <p>But as security has improved Pakistan has hosted a smattering of smaller matches including Twenty20 series with Zimbabwe and the West Indies, and an increasing number of domestic league matches featuring international players.</p>
      <p>But until now no team has returned for a Test match, the five-day format considered the pinnacle of the game.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka toured Pakistan for three one-day internationals and as many Twenty20s in September and October, and said they were satisfied with the security arrangements before confirming the Test tour.Â </p>
