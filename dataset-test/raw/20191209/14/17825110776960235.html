      <p>Madrid - Youths from developing countries are concerned about the planet's future and their respective governments' inadequacy at combating climate change. </p>
      <p>The announcement was made by activists from the Americas, Africa and Asia during a press conference on Monday at the United Climate Change Conference - COP25 - in Madrid, Spain. </p>
      <p>The youngsters shared their fears about the extreme weather patterns and pollution damaging their home countries and continents. </p>
      <p>National leaders have been heavily criticised at this year's COP25 for the insufficient mitigation and adaption measures in place to fight climate change.</p>
      <p>Nakabuye Flavia, a student from Uganda, described the lack of climate action as "environmental racism".</p>
