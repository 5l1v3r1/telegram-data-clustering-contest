      <p>As an agriculture family, your farm is also a business. Working with local professionals who understand that business can bring significant savings.</p>
      <p>“Maximizing savings on products and services you use regularly – such as communications devices and office supplies – pays off in the long run,” say Krista and Todd Schlender.</p>
      <p>Operators of <a href="https://www.stettlermobilesolutions.com/">Stettler Mobile Solutions</a> since 2013, the couple are small business and Ag experts who work to save business people money on everything from their commercial cell phone plan and home office equipment to personal electronics.</p>
      <p>“We encourage farm families to come in for a coffee and a chat to talk about ways they could potentially save themselves some valuable money and time,” says Krista, a born-and-raised Stettler resident who returned to open the business with Todd.</p>
