      <h1>Five famous people you probably didn’t know were of Tanzanian descent</h1>

      <p>Tanzania is the largest country in eastern Africa. It is known as the highest point in Africa with the <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/explore-tanzanias-wealthiest-mt-kilimanjaro-tribe-and-the-ingenious-ways-they-made-their-money">Kilimanjaro </a>and its beautiful islands such as Zanzibar, Pemba, and Mafia.</p>
      <p>The country which was formed by merging Tanganyika and Zanzibar became independent in 1964.</p>
      <p>Until resigning as president in 1985, independence leader <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/is-julius-nyerere-africas-most-important-personality-in-human-history">Julius K. Nyerere</a> was in charge of two decades of socialism – adopting the policy of village farming. A multiparty system was established in 1992 after a constitutional amendment.</p>
      <p>With a population of 57 million people, 80 percent of Tanzanians farm or fish at subsistence levels; in many areas tse-tse fly infestation hampers successful animal husbandry. </p>
      <p>Tourism remains an important aspect of the economy. Dar es Salaam is the administrative capital, but Dodoma is the designated future capital and current home to Tanzania’s legislature.</p>
