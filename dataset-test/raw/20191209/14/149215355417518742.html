Almost no Game of Thrones - Believe it or not, Game of Thrones picked up just one single nomination, with Kit Harington landing an acting nod. Other than that, the series was shockingly almost completely shut out of the show, not landing in the best drama series category at all. 2. No When They See Us - The acclaimed Ava DuVernay Netflix drama was one of the nominees for Outstanding Limited Series at the Emmys, but at the Golden Globes, it was shut out entirely. 3.

      <p>The Golden Globe nominations are here to baffle everyone once again.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/2020-golden-globes-nominations-list-nominees-1203426905/">nominations for 2020's show announced Monday</a> are chock-full of shocking snubs, from the biggest television event in recent memory getting almost completely shut out to an acclaimed limited series getting zero nominations. Let's run through some of the oddest snubs from this year's Golden Globe nominations.</p>
      <p><b>1. Almost no <i>Game of Thrones</i> </b>- Believe it or not, <i>Game of Thrones </i>picked up just <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/game-of-thrones-golden-globes-nominations-season-8-1203427905/">one single nomination</a>, with Kit Harington landing an acting nod. Other than that, the series was shockingly almost completely shut out of the show, not landing in the best drama series category at all.</p>
      <p><b>2</b>. <b>No</b> <b><i>When They See Us</i></b> - The acclaimed Ava DuVernay Netflix drama was one of the nominees for Outstanding Limited Series at the Emmys, but at the Golden Globes, it was shut out entirely.</p>
      <p><b>3</b>. <b>No De Niro </b>- Robert De Niro has been considered an Oscar favorite for his performance in <i>The Irishman</i>, yet he failed to pick up a nomination in the lead drama actor category.</p>
      <p><b>4</b>. <b>No Gerwig </b>- <i>Little Women</i>'s Greta Gerwig was surprisingly snubbed from the best director field, meaning there is once again not a single female nominee in that category.</p>
      <p><b>5. No <i>Veep </i>or Louis-Dreyfus </b>- After Julia Louis-Dreyfus came up short of an Emmys win for the final season of <i>Veep</i>, the Golden Globes twisted the knife by snubbing her from the leading actress in a musical or comedy series category. <i>Veep </i>itself was also left out of the top comedy series category.</p>
      <p><b>6. Almost no <i>Cats </i>- </b>Reviews<b><i> </i></b>for <i>Cats </i>haven't yet hit, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/golden-snubs-and-surprises-including-no-love-for-cats/2019/12/09/a32b629a-1a8d-11ea-977a-15a6710ed6da_story.html">voters saw an unfinished cut</a>. It didn't score a nomination for best musical or comedy, though, instead only getting an original song nod. "The [Hollywood Foreign Press Association] is the only group that got to see <i>Cats</i> before voting, and it still got zero nominations outside of song," <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelAAdams/status/1204032999001612290"><i>Slate</i>'s Sam Adams tweeted</a>. "That's ... not good."</p>
