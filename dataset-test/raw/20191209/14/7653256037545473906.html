      <p>BENGALURU: A delegation from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/New-Zealand">New Zealand</a>, that has ranked first on the Ease of Doing Business, is conducting a five-day workshop under Knowledge Transfer Programme in Bengaluru to help <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India">India</a>'s tech capital improve its ranking.</p>
      <p>Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, who opened the workshop, said: “New Zealand is number one in the Ease of Doing World Ranking. In this regard, we have collaborated with the New Zealand High Commission for G2G know-how with respect to Ease of Doing Business. Hence, the delegation is here to conduct a workshop on the same.”</p>
      <p>He called upon the officials to make good use of the workshop. He also said the officials from the concerned departments will travel to New Zealand to understand the business processes at the government-level.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Karnataka">Karnataka</a> will witness an increase in economic growth and job opportunities with an improvement in ease of doing business. The officials must work towards bringing Bengaluru to the forefront in ease of doing business index, he said.</p>
      <p>The State Government has brought 500 <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/oracle-financial-services-software-ltd/stocks/companyid-3160.cms">services</a> online under ‘Sakala’ scheme. It will help citizens utilise services that are online. A <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/WhatsApp">WhatsApp</a> group must be brought into existence to provide information regarding online services under ease of doing business, he said.</p>
      <p>Those in small, medium and large <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/titan-company-ltd/stocks/companyid-12903.cms">industries</a> must be added to this group. Social media platform twitter too must be used to disseminate the information, the Chief Secretary said.</p>
