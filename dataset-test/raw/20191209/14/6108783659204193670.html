      <h3>Support will continue on all available platforms.</h3>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-legends/">Elder Scrolls Legends</a> </i>development has been placed on hold, Bethesda said of its card-based title.</p>
      <p>“We decided to put any new content development or releases on hold for the foreseeable future. This decision will not in any way affect the release and development of GAEA’s Asia-specific version of Legends, which is operated separately, but will inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward,” Bethesda wrote in an update <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollslegends/comments/e70lbu/an_update_on_the_elder_scrolls_legends/">on Reddit</a>.</p>
      <p>The game will remain playable — and supported — on all available platforms, Bethesda also confirmed.</p>
      <p>“Until then, you can still download and play <i>Legends</i> on all existing platforms and compete online as well as in the single-player modes. We will also continue to support the game with monthly reward cards and regular in-game events,” the update continues. “New expansions and other future content, however, are no longer under active development. We will continue to provide ongoing maintenance support.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/pete-hines-on-switching-developers-for-the-elder-scrolls-legends/">Studio Sparkypants Studios took over development duties on </a><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/pete-hines-on-switching-developers-for-the-elder-scrolls-legends/">Legends</a> </i>from Dire Wolf back in 2018; it’s unclear how this business decision impacts the studio.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/The-Elder-Scrolls-Legends/">The Elder Scrolls: Legends</a></i> is currently available on Windows PC, Mac, iOS and Android.</p>
