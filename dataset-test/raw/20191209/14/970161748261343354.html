        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/david-beckham/">David Beckham</a> had quite the festive-filled weekend after treating his children Harper and Cruz to a fun day out at Winter Wonderland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Half of the Beckham clan trekked down to London’s Hyde Park on Sunday to enjoy the annual attraction and it looks like they had a whale of a time.</p>
      <p>And, just so he can cherish the memories forever (or the next 24 hours at least), David shared their fun-filled day on his Instagram stories taking the rest of us along on their adventure.</p>
      <p>The family found their inner daredevils and braved one of the huge rollercoasters, but little Harper showed no fear as she smiled excitedly before stepping on with her dad.</p>
      <p>‘Just before the ride #HarpersBrave,’ David captioned the selfie.</p>
      <p>Romeo, 17, also seemed cool as a cucumber as he looked pretty chill while posing for a photo on the ride. His proud father said: ‘Hey Handsome.’</p>
      <p>At one point, the whole clan gathered for a family snap but Cruz, 14, seemed was too cool to smile and screwed up his face.</p>

      <p>The fun continued at the attraction’s Upside Down House, where they posed in themed rooms where the furniture is flipped over to give the illusion of being on the ceiling, defying gravity.</p>
      <p>David, 44, didn’t leave all the festive fun to his kids though as he was seen having the time of his life whirling around on the bumper cars.</p>
      <p>Well we all deserve to be big kids sometimes, right?</p>

      <p>Victoria Beckham seemed to be missing from the Winter Wonderland trip but she did <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/david-beckham-harper-get-festive-spirit-little-fancy-dress-11412764/">enjoy some Christmas festivities with Harper the previous day.</a></p>
      <p>The married couple took the right-year-old to a kids Christmas party at private members’ venue George Club in Mayfair on Saturday, and took silly snaps in a photo booth with props.</p>
      <p>David wore some funky Christmas tree glasses, while Harper posed next to a doll with purple hair.</p>
      <p>@davidbeckham loves his new glasses!! Such a fun day today at #GeorgeClub celebrating with Harper’s friends! Kisses #GeorgeJunior x,’ Victoria captioned the image.</p>
