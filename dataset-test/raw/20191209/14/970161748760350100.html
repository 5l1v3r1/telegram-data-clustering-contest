      <h1>Frank Lampard confirms Antonio Rudiger is 'ready' to return against Lille</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:06:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">Metro Sport Reporter</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> has confirmed that Antonio Rudiger is back in his squad for Chelsea’s all-important <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> clash with Lille on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Blues looked on course to qualify for the last-16 last month as Christian Pulisic put them in front in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/valencia/">Valencia</a> before the Spanish club fought back to salvage a 2-2 draw at the Mestalla.</p>
      <p>That result makes it a huge match for Chelsea tomorrow evening and it comes in the wake of the side’s disappointing 3-1 defeat to Everton at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>However, Lampard has been boosted by the return of Rudiger for the crucial Group H encounter at Stamford Bridge.</p>

      <p>Rudiger recovered from knee surgery to play 45 minutes against Wolves back in mid-September before suffering separate setback with his groin.</p>
      <p>The Germany defender joined up with his team-mates in training at the end of November and is back in contention to make his second appearance of the season.</p>
      <p>‘He is in the squad. It is good to have him back,’ Lampard confirmed at his pre-match press conference on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>‘[Fikayo] Tomori is out, he has had a bit of a hip issue. Olivier [Giroud] is out as well.’</p>
      <p>Asked about Rudiger’s return, Lampard added: ‘It’s potentially difficult but we have given him a lot of work.</p>
      <p>‘He has come through that and he looks fit and ready to go, I know he is hungry.</p>
      <p>‘He is a good defender, you miss those individuals. And then see what he can bring for us.’</p>
