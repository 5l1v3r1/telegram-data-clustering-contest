      <p>Dreadzone are closing business on 2019 with a return to Nottingham for a date at the Rescue Rooms. Greg Roberts does the talking...</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tell us a bit about how you got together as a band?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We originated from Big Audio Dynamite in the '80s, started DZ in '93 and built on that with new members Earl 16 in 1995, `Spee in 2001 and Bazil in 2012.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How would you describe your sound?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bass heavy dubwise dance beats with uplifting vibes and a rich heritage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What can people expect from your Nottingham gig?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The same as usual - energetic bouncing vibes with happy people celebrating and letting loose, new songs from Dubwiser Vol 1 and classic Dread bangers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's your favourite memory of playing in Nottingham in the past?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rock City with Big Audio Dynamite on the reunion tour in 2011.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you enjoy the most about touring?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Connecting with people, seeing the world, exploring different towns and cities around the UK, earning a living doing what I love with a bunch of friends.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's been your best live gig appearance as a performer?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Too many to mention but Glastonbury in the '90s stands out, especially our first one in 94 where John Peel discovered our sound and became a big supporter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are you listening to at the moment?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My son Marlon's piano music and some new material for the next album.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who was the first band/singer you saw play live?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Who at Dunstable Civic Hall with the original line up inc Keith Moon. I was 15.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Any plans for 2020?</b>
      </p>
      <p>New music, new releases, more touring and enjoying life.</p>
