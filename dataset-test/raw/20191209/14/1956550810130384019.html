      <p>Could we really talk about some of the best eats in Dubai without heading to one of its most famous locations?</p>
      <p>In a very wet episode 7, we brave the rain to head to Atlantis The Palm’s brand-new beachside burger joint Beach Buns, and get our hands on some enormous burgers (as well as a couple of even more enormous freakshakes).</p>
      <p>From the Cheese Injection burger (guess what that includes), to the veggie option of The Italian Job and its pure-mozzarella patty, we try some of the most insane burgers yet.</p>
      <p>And you can win a meal for four at Beach Buns by guessing where we’re heading to next on our hunt for Dubai’s Greatest Hellmann’s Burger. Just comment on the below video via YouTube and let us know, and you could win.</p>

      <p>Throughout the series Time Out Dubai’s Darragh and Reema search high and low across the city to bring you the biggest, cheesiest, juiciest burgers – both meat and vegetarian.</p>
      <p>From one of the biggest malls in the world, to one of the smallest restaurants in Dubai, from giant cheeseburgers to entirely vegan burgers, we’re going to be picking out the very best burgers, and telling you where you can get them.</p>
      <p>The entire series will be released on the <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/subscribe">Time Out GCC YouTube channel</a>, and the winner will be announced in a special ninth episode, the season finale – and that’s where you come in, literally.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday December 18, the winning restaurant will be hosting a special celebration evening, where you can get a free burger in exchange for a bottle of Hellmann’s. More details on that to come.</p>
