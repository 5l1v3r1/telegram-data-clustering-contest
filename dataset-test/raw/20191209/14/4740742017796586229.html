      <h2>He is in great form</h2>

      <p>A number of clubs have been linked with Charlton Athletic star Lyle Taylor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> are keen for a striker in January and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/bristol-city-looking-closely-championship-3623058">are said to be keeping close tabs on the 29-year-old,</a> whose contract runs out at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Yet <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> would face competition from the likes of Nottingham Forest and Norwich City, who have both also been linked.</p>
      <p>Here is what fans of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City,</a> Forest, Norwich and Charlton are saying about the striker.</p>

      <h3>Bristol City</h3>
      <p><b>Steve Barry:</b> Would be fab.</p>
      <p><b>Alex Smith:</b> Would be a great signing.</p>
      <p><b>Ian Horrell:</b> Always liked him, been around a bit and obviously needs to settle somewhere. Has all the attributes to play at Championship level and knows where the net is, only downer is his injury record. Worth a £3m IMO.</p>
      <p><b>Aidan Connolly:</b> Would take him, but want Marriott.</p>
      <h3>Nottingham Forest</h3>
      <p><b>Jack:</b> Lyle Taylor would be an outstanding signing for cheap.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Gibb:</b> Dwight Gayle or Lyle Taylor?</p>
      <p><b>Weda:</b> I like him good player with potential.</p>
      <p><b>Tom Morris:</b> Most teams will be interested, let's be honest.</p>
      <p><b>NFFC:</b> Lyle Taylor being one of those injured players... Turns 30 in a few months. Won't be worth the fee that Charlton ask for.</p>
      <p><b>Jac:</b> Would absolutely take Lyle Taylor.</p>
      <h3>Norwich City</h3>
      <p><b>George 2001:</b> If we sign Lyle Taylor then I will cry. A 30 year old average Championship striker is just what we need.</p>
      <p><b>Alex:</b> Would be honestly shocked. Doesn't fit the club's philosophy at all and we'd probably end up giving him a lot on wages.</p>
      <p><b>TRJ:</b> If we’ve basically accepted relegation then him on a free, as back-up, could be a decent option. Not the rumour we really wantthough &amp; seems very unlikely to be true with the other names linked.</p>
      <h3>Charlton Athletic</h3>
      <p><b>Daniel Pascoe:</b> Taylor's really bad, don't take him.</p>
