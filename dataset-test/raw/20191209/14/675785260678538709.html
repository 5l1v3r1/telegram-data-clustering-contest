      <p>A runner who slapped a female reporter on her bottom during a live TV broadcast of a race has been banned from future events.</p>
      <p>The man was filmed appearing to assault WSAV reporter Alex Bozarjian while she was covering the Enmarket Savannah Bridge Run in Georgia, US, on Saturday. </p>
      <p>The video, which has been shared on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> by hundreds of thousands of people, shows Ms Bozarjian in shock after a runner comes up behind her to smack her on her bum.</p>
      <p>The TV reporter later <a href="https://twitter.com/wsavalexb/status/1203372986948112391">retweeted the video</a> and said: "To the man who smacked my butt on live TV this morning. You violated, objectified, and embarrassed me. No woman should EVER have to put up with this at work or anywhere!! Do better."</p>

      <p>The video, which has had more than 9 million views, prompted outrage on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Social media users were quick to try and identify the runner using his bib number, who according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7770775/Runner-banned-racing-slap-reporters-butt-blasts-violating-TV.html">Daily Mail</a> is a youth church minister.</p>
      <p>Savannah Sports Council <a href="https://twitter.com/SavannahSports/status/1203760567728644096">tweeted</a> on Sunday that it would ban the runner from taking part in any future events.</p>
