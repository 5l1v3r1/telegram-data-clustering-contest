      <p>PUTRAJAYA, Dec 9 — The Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) will offer discounts up to 90 per cent for the settlement of compounds imposed on registered corporations from January 1 to April 30, next year.</p>
      <p>Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the discount offer only applies to compounds issued for offences stipulated under the Companies Act 1965 and 2016.</p>
      <p>The offences include the failure, among others, to file annual returns; to prepare, circulate and submit financial statements; to hold annual general meetings (for public companies); to respond to SSM notices, and failure to present financial statements, he said.</p>
      <p>At the event, Saifuddin also witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Malaysia Competition Commission (MyCC) and the Monash University Malaysia, Brickfields Asia College (BAC) and the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER).</p>
      <p>He said the collaboration was to develop MyCC’s education and research activities as well as its advocacy programmes.</p>
      <p>It was also to strengthen the implementation of the Competition Act 2010 to better protect healthy competition processes for businesses and consumers, he said. — Bernama</p>
