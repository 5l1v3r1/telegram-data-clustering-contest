      <p>SAN DIEGO — <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/stephen-strasburg/500543">Stephen Strasburg</a> is returning to Washington with a record contract, and fellow free agent pitcher Gerrit Cole could be in line for an even larger payday.</p>
      <p>The World Series MVP and the Nationals agreed to a $245 million, seven-year contract Monday, the first significant announcement at this week’s winter meetings.</p>

      <p>A 31-year-old right-hander, Strasburg received the highest deal for a pitcher in both total dollars and average annual value at $35 million. The largest contract for a pitcher had been <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/david-price/388363">David Price</a>‘s $217 million, seven-year deal with Boston that began in 2016. The highest average value had been <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/zack-greinke/202781">Zack Greinke</a>‘s $34.4 million as part of a $206.5 million, six-year agreement with Arizona prior to the 2016 season.</p>
      <p>"We would not have won the 2019 World Series or accomplished everything we have these last 10 seasons if not for Stephen’s many contributions," Nationals owner Mark Lerner said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Strasburg gets $35 million annually, with $80 million deferred — about $11.4 million a year. The deferred money is payable from 2028-30.</p>
      <p>The contract sets a floor for Cole, who is expected to top the records Strasburg just set.</p>
      <p>Cole, whose Astros lost to the Nationals in a seven-game World Series, is two years younger and has been healthier throughout his career. Like Strasburg, he’s represented by agent Scott Boras.</p>
      <p>Strasburg was drafted first overall by Washington in 2009 and has spent his entire career with the Nationals. He’ll stay in a rotation that also features All-Stars <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/max-scherzer/326473">Max Scherzer</a> and <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/patrick-corbin/500846">Patrick Corbin</a>.</p>
      <p>"He’s a wonderful person, a wonderful player and a true champion," Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said at a news conference. "We know this person, we know his character, we know his work ethic."</p>
      <p>After helping win the first World Series title in the 51-season history of the Montreal/Washington franchise, Strasburg gave up $100 million he had been guaranteed from 2020-23 as part of a $175 million, seven-year contract he agreed to in May 2016 and became a free agent.</p>
      <p>He was 18-6 with a 3.32 ERA this season, topping 30 starts for the second time in his career and leading the NL with 209 innings. He went 5-0 with a 1.98 ERA in five post-season starts and one relief appearance, including wins in Games 2 and 6 of the World Series against Houston.</p>
      <p>In a career interrupted by Tommy John surgery shortly after his spectacular major league debut in 2010, Strasburg is 112-58 with a 3.17 ERA and 1,695 strikeouts in parts of 10 seasons. He’s made 10 trips to the disabled list over seven of those years.</p>
      <p>Strasburg’s average annual value is second among all players behind outfielder <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/mike-trout/500736">Mike Trout</a>‘s $35.5 million in a $426.5 million, 12-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels that started last season.</p>
      <p>Washington has invested heavily in starting pitching. Scherzer, also a Boras client, agreed to a $210 million, seven-year contract before the 2015 season. Corbin reached a $140 million, six-year deal last off-season.</p>
      <p>Rizzo confirmed a pending $6.25 million, one-year deal to keep second baseman Howie Kendrick, one of Washington’s post-season stars. All-Star third baseman Anthony Rendon, another key component of the Nationals’ title, also is a free agent represented by Boras.</p>
      <p>"Ownership has always given us the resources to field a great term," Rizzo said. "I don’t expect that to change."</p>
