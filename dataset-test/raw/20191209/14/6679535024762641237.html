      <p>The Shivajinagar police on Saturday arrested a 22-year-old habitual offender for allegedly carrying a country-made pistol and two live cartridges. Based on a tip-off, the police intercepted him near Russell market where he had come for shopping.</p>
      <p>The accused has been identified as Shaik Mustafa, a native of Siddapura in Bhatkal. Mustafa, during the questioning, revealed that a few months ago, he had gone to Mumbai and stayed there for a while. He had managed to steal the pistol from someone and returned to the city.</p>
      <p>Mustafa claimed that he was working in a hotel in Mumbai where he managed to get the weapon and also had a plan to go to Dubai for a while.</p>
      <p>He was involved in bike theft cases in Kumta, Bhatkal and other places in Dakshin Kannada and was arrested by the police a couple of times. He came to the city to commit a robbery and thought that he would threaten the people.</p>
      <p>“We have taken Mustafa into four days’ police custody for further investigations and are also probing further to ascertain whether Mustafa was planning any crime with the weapon,” a police officer said.</p>
