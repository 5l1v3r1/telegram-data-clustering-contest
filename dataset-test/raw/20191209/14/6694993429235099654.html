      <p>New studio flats are set to be built in <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bolton">Bolton town centre</a> after the developer reached a compromise with the town council.</p>
      <p>An empty warehouse in Bark Street East can now be demolished to make way for nine apartments which were granted planning permission by a committee of councillors last Thursday, after the landowner was told the previous plans for 12 flats were not big enough.</p>
      <p>Councillors deferred the application in September because the proposed one-bedroom apartments were only 39 square metres, the minimum required to meet national standards.</p>
      <p>Town hall planners told the committee that the unit sizes have increased “modestly” to 46 square metres and “suburban” features were removed to match the Georgian properties opposites.</p>
      <p>Crompton councillor Hanif Darvesh said these revised plans were “much more in-keeping” with the conservation area it sits in.</p>
      <p>Cllr Elaine Sherrington thanked the applicant for “taking notice” of the committee’s comments.</p>
      <p>She added: “I welcome this and I think they look brilliant.”</p>
