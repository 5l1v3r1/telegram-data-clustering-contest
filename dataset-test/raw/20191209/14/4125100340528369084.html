      <p>A Female judge has been accused of using her courtroom to have group sex with lawyers.</p>
      <p>Judge Dawn Gentry, 38, from Kentucky, US, is also alleged to have pressurised lawyers into having threesomes with her and her ex-pastor lover.</p>
      <p>Those lawyers who refused her requests were then not given preferential treatment in their cases, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>Divorced Gentry denies the allegations against her.</p>
      <p>She is said to have used social media app Snapchat to flirt with lawyers, according to the Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission.</p>

      <p>Among the charges, Gentry is also accused of having a threesome involving her secretary and with her lover Stephen Penrose, a former Christian pastor, as well as allowing employees to get drunk on the job.</p>
      <p>Gentry is also accused of using her position to secure Penrose a job in court as a case specialist.</p>
      <p>The judicial commission has also spoken to Katherine Schulz, who was on a panel with Gentry, to deal with cases of child abuse.</p>
      <p>Shulz claims that Gentry used Snapchat to ask her to seduce her former husband, Brian Gentry so that she could then accuse him of infidelity.</p>
      <p>Representatives of Gentry have denied she engaged in inappropriate or unwanted sexual advances toward Ms. Schulz as well as the other charges. <i><b>(Metro UK)</b></i></p>
