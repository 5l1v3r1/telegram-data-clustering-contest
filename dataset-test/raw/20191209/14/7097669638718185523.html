        <li>The crash happened on Interstate 95 in Norwalk, Connecticut. The police car was stationary behind a disabled vehicle, with flashers on and road flares behind it.Â </li>

          <b>No one was injured in the crash, but it's the latest such example of Tesla cars with Autopilot crashing into things; one such crash in 2018 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-x-fatal-crash-autopilot-was-activated-2018-3">resulted in the driver's death</a>.</b>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-autopilot-now-almost-everywhere-2015-10">Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot</a> engaged crashed into a stationary police car on the Connecticut highway on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The Model 3's driver was checking on his dog in the backseat with Autopilot engaged when the Tesla sedan crashed into a police cruiser that had stopped to assist a driver with a disabled vehicle, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/connecticutstatepolice/posts/2559517627610906">according to Connecticut State Police</a>. The police cruiser had its emergency lights on, and road flares were placed behind it.</p>
      <p>No one was injured in the crash, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/connecticutstatepolice/posts/2559517627610906">Connecticut State Police reported in a statement</a>. After the Tesla Model 3 ran into the parked police cruiser, it continued moving and struck the disabled vehicle as well.</p>

      <p>Notably, the Autopilot feature on Tesla's cars isn't intended to be used as a replacement for actual driving.</p>
      <p>"Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous," Tesla's website says.</p>
      <p>That warning isn't stopping some Tesla owners from using the feature regardless, of course. Tesla drivers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drivers-sleeping-in-tesla-cars-autopilot-asleep-while-driving-videos-2019-12">have repeatedly been caught napping while driving</a> on Autopilot.</p>
      <p>And though sleeping may not have been the cause in either case, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-autopilot-faces-scrutiny-after-accidents-2018-5">at least two fatal crashes have occurred</a> involving Tesla's running on Autopilot.</p>
      <p>Connecticut State Police issued a warning to potential Autopilot users: "Regardless of your vehicles capabilities, when operating a vehicle your full attention is required at all times to ensure safe driving."</p>
