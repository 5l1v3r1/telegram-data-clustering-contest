      <h1>Wijnaldum back, Keita or Ox keep place? – Predicting Liverpool’s lineup vs. Salzburg</h1>

        <b>More rotation is expected from <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> on Tuesday night, as Liverpool visit Salzburg in a make-or-break <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> clash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Reds enjoyed a drama-free victory on Saturday, easing to a 3-0 win away to an ineffective <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> side.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s men are two matches into a relentless December that could see them play nine times across four different competitions.</p>
      <p>Next up is Tuesday’s trip to Salzburg, with Liverpool knowing that avoiding defeat will see them reach the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> knockout stage.</p>
      <p>Rotation has been the order of the day of late and that should be no different at the Red Bull Arena.</p>

      <p>Liverpool look set to be without <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/dejan-lovren/">Dejan Lovren</a> for Tuesday’s match, after the Croatian left the pitch early against <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> with cramp.</p>
      <p>He joins <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joel-matip/">Joel Matip</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> on the sidelines, with the pair not expected to be available before Christmas.</p>
      <p>On the plus side, however, Klopp has hinted that <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/adam-lallana/">Adam Lallana</a> will be back, having missed out on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Key pair <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> didn’t start at the weekend, so it would be a surprise they didn’t return to the starting lineup.</p>
      <h3>Liverpool’s Starting XI vs. Salzburg</h3>

      <p>There are elements of Liverpool’s team that picks itself on Tuesday, given their injury problems at the back.</p>
      <p>The absence of both Lovren and Matip means <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a> will partner <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a> – a pairing that looked so imperious in the early months of last season.</p>
      <p>Gomez was used at right-back against <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, but his shift to a central berth will coincide with Alexander-Arnold returning.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have impressed in midfield since <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>‘s injury and captain <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a> is set to continue in the No.6 role.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a> enjoyed a big impact on Saturday and arguably deserves to keep his place further forward, while <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/james-milner/">James Milner</a> is often a favourite of Klopp’s in big games.</p>
      <p>The same applies to Wijnaldum, though, and with Milner starting the last two matches, the Dutchman will surely replace him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> has been a star performer in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> this season, too, scoring three times in the two wins over Genk.</p>
      <p>That may give him the edge over Keita, who may be saved for Saturday’s visit of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/watford">Watford</a> in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a>; Trent, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Salah, Mane, Firmino</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Given Klopp’s recent rotation, this team is far from a given.</p>
      <p>The defence should be nailed-on, but the manager could easily go with a lineup as much-changed as the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/everton">Everton</a> one last week.</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum could take up the deep-lying role, with Henderson given the night off, while Keita and Oxlade-Chamberlain make up an exciting-looking attacking midfield duo.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The returning Lallana is also an option, though.</p>
      <p>Klopp may also decide to keep the much-famed front-three apart again, resting <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> but bringing back Mane.</p>
      <p>That would create room for Merseyside derby heroes <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/xherdan-shaqiri/">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/divock-origi/">Divock Origi</a> to come in and prove their worth again.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a>; Trent, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Wijnaldum, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Shaqiri, Mane, Origi</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Second-guessing Klopp is often difficult, but at this time of year that becomes even more prevalent.</p>
      <p>He has made it clear that he will be making several changes each game, however, so we will almost certainly see something different to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>.</p>
      <p>It will be a tough night for Liverpool, with the match acting as a cup final for Salzburg – arguably the biggest night in their history.</p>
      <p>Should the Reds lose and Napoli win at home to Genk, their <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> defence will end in rather embarrassingly early fashion.</p>
