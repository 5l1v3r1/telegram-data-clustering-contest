      <p>It's been just over a week since the celebrity series finished but The X Factor is back this week with a brand new spin-off.</p>
      <p>For the first time in the show's history it will air on a Monday night as X Factor: The Band makes its debut on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> . With <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> and fellow judge Nicole Scherzinger at the helm, the new series seems to have sprung from nowhere, following the axing of the planned All Stars specials.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">The X Factor</a> has a great track record at finding successful groups, with One Direction, Little Mix and JLS all landing a string of huge chart hits after leaving the show, with the American version of the show created worldwide famous girl group Fifth Harmony.</p>
      <p>It is heavily rumoured that Simon's decision to bring the show to air so soon was prompted by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/news-opinion/simon-cowell-v-little-mix-17194585">Little Mix announcing their own talent show The Search,</a> which will debut on rival channel BBC1 next year.</p>
      <h3>How will X Factor The Band work?</h3>
      <p>The Band will see singers audition for Simon Cowell in his office before going onto compete at arena rounds in Birmingham, where, just like One Direction and Little Mix were, they will be put into bands and have to compete against each other.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the show says "Simon Cowell and The X Factor have discovered some of the biggest pop groups in history, including One Direction, Fifth Harmony and Little Mix. Now the aim is to find the new superstar group – though now in record-breaking time.”</p>
      <p>Addressing the Little Mix speculation, Simon told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10271963/simon-cowell-little-mix-rival-show/">The Sun</a> "This is what really happened. I was approached to co-produce that show last year by Little Mix’s management.</p>
      <p>“I told them the problem was we have a conflict of interest because we are launching X Factor: The Band in 2020. We were told their show was going to launch in 2021.</p>
      <p>“Then we had the fallout and find out Little Mix were bringing their show forward. Was that intentional because we are doing our show? I have no idea."</p>
