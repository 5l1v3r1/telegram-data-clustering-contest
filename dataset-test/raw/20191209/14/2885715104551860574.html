      <p>After suffering a rib fracture, Ali was ruled out of the Test squad on November 30th. The pace-bowler was set to play for Central Punjab in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa last week, but pulled out because of his injury.</p>
      <p>Ali underwent precautionary medical tests and scans after that which confirmed his cortical rib fractures. He had also missed out on the T20I series in Australia last month due to a back problem.</p>
      <p>Replying to the video posted on Twitter by the journalist, fans hit out at the 25-year-old Pakistani cricketer for lacking professionalism and blaming him for putting the prospect of money ahead of playing the sport.</p>
