      <p>A spokeswoman from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office in Illinois confirmed the death of the rapper, born Jarad Higgins, at 3:14 am (0914 GMT). An autopsy has been set for Monday.</p>
      <p>Police told AFP that a 21-year-old man had suffered a medical emergency at Chicago’s Midway International Airport after getting off a private jet.</p>
      <p>Celebrity news outlet TMZ reported that Higgins had suffered a seizure.</p>
      <p>Juice WRLD’s breakout single “Lucid Dreams,” rose to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2018, with his follow-up album “Death Race for Love” debuting in first place on the Billboard 200 earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“Juice made a profound impact on the world in such a short period of time,” his label Interscope Records said in a statement. “To lose someone so kind and so close to our hearts is devastating.”</p>
      <p>“Lucid Dreams” quickly re-entered the top 10 on the US iTunes site as news of his death spread.</p>
      <p>The rapper was of a generation known as the “SoundCloud rappers” — a subgenre that takes its name from the streaming platform where its artists first find fame.</p>
      <p>The crop of rappers in recent years has become a disruptive movement in hip-hop, combining a lo-fi underground sound with raw, often emotionally laden lyrics leading some to dub them “emo rappers.”</p>
      <p>These musicians whose careers are built on internet stardom often rap about popping drugs, notably Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication.</p>
      <p>Along with prescription medication, the subculture’s aesthetic includes face tattoos and neon-dyed hair.</p>
      <p>– ‘I have a lot going for me’ –</p>
      <p>The SoundCloud scene has launched careers and sales figures but the lives of its figures are often volatile.</p>
      <p>XXXTentacion was murdered in 2018, while Tekashi69, seeking leniency on serious racketeering and weapons charges, this year was a star government witness at the trial of alleged former gang associates.</p>
      <p>And in 2017, the rapper Lil Peep died at age 21 of what was declared an accidental overdose of fentanyl and Xanax.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The New York Times in 2018, Juice WRLD said that he used Xanax heavily as a teenager but was aiming to curb his drug use.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot going for me, I recognize it’s a lot of big things, a lot of big looks. I want to be there, and you don’t have to overdose to not be there,” he told the Times.</p>
      <p>Music and industry insiders took to social media to pay tribute to the rapper upon learning of his shock death.</p>
      <p>“Wow, I can not believe this. Rip my brother juice world,” tweeted fellow rapper Lil Yachty.</p>
      <p>“rip juice,” tweeted breakout star Lil Nas X. “so sad how often this is happening lately to young talented rising artists.” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7769591/Rising-US-rap-artist-Juice-WRLD-dies-21-reports.html"><b>AFP</b></a></p>
