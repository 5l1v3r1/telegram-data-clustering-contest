      <p><b>PITTSBURGH</b> - UPMC may not move into the Freight House Shops at Station Square after all.</p>
      <p>While the region's largest health system inked a deal last year to establish a new training center as part of a full renovation of the Freight House Shops portion of Station Square, CBRE is now marketing UPMC's 36,435 square feet in the historic railroad building as available for sublease.</p>
