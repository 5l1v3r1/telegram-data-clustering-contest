      <p>Though Ananya Panday may be just one film old, her second release, <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/pati-patni-aur-woh-movie-review-kartik-aaryan-ananya-panday-bhumi-pednekar/"><i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i></a> has been winning her accolades ever since the film hits the theatres. The film features Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday playing the <i>Pati, Pati and Woh</i> respectively. While Ananya Panday feels she is a very shy person in real life, she does relate to her character of Tapasya in the film.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the same, Ananya is however adamant that she would never do a film that she does not relate to. Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, “Personally, I am not drawn to misogynistic, sexist or gender-biased movie. Since as an audience I would not want to watch a film like that, so I would not want to choose a film like that either.”</p>
      <p>“I would rather sit at home and do nothing than picking something which I don’t believe in completely. I have time because I have started out young, so I don’t need to rush and finish things. You have to be in love with the films that you make because it’s such a long journey, so I don’t want to do anything half-heartedly,” she added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, directed by Mudassar Aziz, <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i> is a remake to the 1978 classic comedy, by the same name which featured celebrated actors like Sanjeev Kumar, Vidya Sinha and Ranjeeta Kaur. The original film revolved around the life of a married man who falls for his office secretary despite having a happy marriage with his wife and having a child too!</p>
      <p>The remake released on the 6th December 2019 and is being received very warmly by the audiences and critics alike.</p>
