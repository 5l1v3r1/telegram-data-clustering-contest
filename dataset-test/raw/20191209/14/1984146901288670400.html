      <p>The report claims the three clubs have scouted Diarra ‘intensely’.</p>
      <h4>Mbwana Samatta (Genk)</h4>

      <p>He's on international duty with Tanzania, and was questioned as he landed at the airport.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Newcastle United are tracking Genk striker Mbwana Samatta, according to the BBC’s Ian Dennis.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old is said to have a release clause of £10 million.</p>
      <p>He’s scored six goals this season, adding to his total of 32 from last year.</p>
      <p>West Ham also said to be interested.</p>
      <h4>Granit Xhaka (Arsenal)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The Times reports that Newcastle are weighing up a winter move for Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>The report claims Xhaka would be a loan move and Newcastle would offer to pay a percentage of the player's £130,000 wage - with United's wage ceiling for new signings pushed by Miguel Almiron's £80,000-a-week wage.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder was stripped of the captaincy this week after storming from the pitch after being substituted - he appeared to swear at his own fans. He was further annoyed at the club for putting his Instagram statement in the club programme this week, and adding an introductory sentence.</p>
      <p>With Euro 2020 on the horizon, the selling point is said to be the offer of first-team football.</p>
      <h4>Habib Diallo (Metz FC)</h4>

      <p>The 24-year-old has scored seven goals in 11 games.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese international is thought to be rated at around £7 million.</p>
      <h4>Degnand Wilfried Gnonto (Inter Milan)</h4>

      <p>Reports in Italy claim that Newcastle United are monitoring 15-year-old Degnand Wilfried Gnonto.</p>
      <p>The Inter Milan youngster has impressed and Inter News claim that Arsenal and the Magpies are considering a move for the defender.</p>
      <p>The claim goes onto state Inter are looking to offer him a contract to stave off interest.</p>

      <p>The defensive midfielder shone for the Czech Republic last month against England - and has several Premier League admirers according to report.</p>
      <p>He only moved to Spartak in the summer for €11m.</p>

      <p>Claims from north of the border report that United are 'closing in' on a deal for 16-year-old Reagan Thomson.</p>
      <p>The Daily Record claim that United have opened talks over the youngster and are close to agreeing a 'substantial fee' for the player, and could see a move completed for January.</p>
      <h4>Papiss Cisse (Alanyaspor)</h4>
      <p>A report in Teamtalk on Monday, October 28 claimed Cisse's agent was ringing round Premier League clubs offering the striker's services - with Newcastle one of the clubs invited to bid.</p>
      <p>But the report was quickly knocked down by the club and sources close to the player, who suggested there has been no contact with United.</p>
      <p>A good blast of nostalgia on a grim Monday maybe, but this isn't going to happen anytime soon.</p>

      <p>SportBild claim that United were one of eight clubs who made a move - the Magpies’ bid totalling €28m.</p>
      <p>The forward hasn’t played this season after undergoing an operation.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>June: According to reports in France, Newcastle have opened the bidding for Mainz striker Jean-Philippe Mateta.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old scored 14 goals in his debut season in the Bundesliga, and that has prompted interest from the Premier League.</p>
      <p>L'Equipe report that Newcastle have been somewhere in the region of £17m-£22m, well below the reported valuation of £35m.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ugurcan Cakir (Trabzonspor)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Turkish outlet 61 Saat namechecked United as one of four clubs who had sent "observers" to watch 23-year-old goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir.</p>
      <p>The Trabzonspor stopper has also been watched by Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs according to the website - although the quality of Turkish transfer rumours is notoriously sketchy.</p>
      <p>Although Newcastle are monitoring a wide range of players - including goalkeepers - at the moment, they are also considering a possible succession plan which would see Freddie Woodman take over from Martin Dubravka, who is close to signing a new contract.</p>
      <p>Cakir has been impressing in the Super Lig recently and has a single cap for his country.</p>

        <b>Lewis Gibson (Everton)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Newcastle United are being tipped to re-sign Gibson, the promising centre-back, in the summer when he is out of contract.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old left the club to join Everton in a £6million deal and was part of the England under-17 side which won the World Cup. But, according to the Daily Mail, he has grown frustrated at a lack of first team football after two years starring for the under-23s.</p>
      <p>He is close to the Longstaff brothers and has seen the pair progress. The Liverpool Echo confirmed his progress is "at a crossroads" and he may re-assess his options in the summer, when Newcastle would be ready to move again.</p>

      <h4> </h4>
      <p>We’re still a few months away from the January transfer but here we are again - it’s those Sean Longstaff and MUFC rumours (yey!)</p>
      <p>The Daily Star claim that MUFC’s Ed Woodward believes they can get Sean Longstaff to Old Trafford in the winter for just £40m.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>MUFC also want to add some steel to their midfield and are preparing to launch a fresh bid to land rising Magpies star Longstaff.</p>
      <p>Longstaff, 21, has only made eight Premier League appearances due to a succession of injuries, but has been earmarked as a future England international.</p>
      <p>MUFC enquired about Longstaff in the summer but were put off by the Magpies’ asking price of around £55m.</p>
      <p>But Woodward believes the current crisis on Tyneside could persuade the troubled club to cash in on Longstaff in January and agree to sell him for around £40m.</p>

      <p>Portuguese media outlet, Record, claim that NUFC were interesting in his services this summer - offering a loan deal with an option to buy for the 30-year-old but that was ‘flatly’ rejected by club president Frederico Varandas.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> are keen to sign players who represent significant sell-on value and they have refused to sanction big money deals for players over 26 years of age in the past.</p>
      <p>Elmohamady wouldn't cost too much but at 31 years of age, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> faces a battle to convince the hierarchy of the value of signing the right-back.

      <p>The midfielder joined Sevilla from Lille last summer but struggled to hold down a regular place. He made 32 appearances but 14 of those were from the bench.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest Sevilla are willing to cash in this summer and will be willing to accept £13m - the price they paid 12 months ago.</p>

      <p>Claims this week from national press were that a deal is in place and the green light is all that is needed to sign the deal off.</p>
      <p>However German media claim talks aren’t all that progressed.</p>
      <p>German media outlet Kicker writes that: “a rapid departure of the 22-year-old is not to be expected” and that €40m may not enough to land the forward.</p>

      <p>The 16-year-old forward is out of contract at Camp Nou, and could be secured for a minimal transfer fee under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fifa">FIFA</a> training compensation regulations.</p>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund - who have successfully evolved a strategy of recruiting elite academy products such as Christian Pulisic and Jadon Sancho - have already made offers to Ansu, as have Ligue 1 AS Monaco and Nice.</p>
      <p>The teenager and his father are understood to be unimpressed with both the financial terms and development pathway offered by Barcelona on a new three-year deal.</p>
      <p>Ansu, who will turn 17 in October, feels he is ready to step up to the senior ranks in the coming season and has asked to be promoted to a Barca B team that recently finished eighth in La Liga’s Segunda Division B.</p>

        <b>July: Signed for Dalian Yifang</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>NEW (14.06) -  </b>Newcastle’s interest in acquiring Rondon permanently is entirely dependent upon <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Rafa Benitez</a> penning a contract extension; if the Magpies manager leaves at the end of this month, then the club will not countenance signing a player who turns 30 in September.</p>
      <p>Even if Benitez stays, however, Newcastle are reluctant to meet Rondon’s £16.5million release clause, as well as match his wage demands and the fee his agent is asking for, meaning protracted negotiations could ensue.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, although Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham United have both registered a keen interest in Rondon, it is understood that both of those Premier League clubs are also currently baulking at the cost of the overall package to acquire Rondon given his age.</p>
      <p>Neither club has yet withdrawn their interest, but Wolves are exploring ways to reduce the overall cost of any deal, while West Ham are pursuing other transfer targets for now. Whether the collective concern shown by Newcastle, Wolves and West Ham leads to Rondon and his agent’s demands dropping later in the summer remains to be see.</p>
      <p>

      <p>According to Wolverhampton’s local paper <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2019/06/01/wolves-head-the-race-for-west-broms-salomon-rondon/">the Express and Star,</a> Wolves are favourites to sign West Brom forward Salomon Rondon this summer.</p>
      <p>Rondon excelled on loan at Newcastle last season, scoring 12 goals and registering seven assists in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Manager Rafa Benitez is desperate to make the move permanent but given his own contract at Newcastle runs out at the end of this month, no progress has been made on any deal as that uncertainty persists.</p>
      <p>And now it is believed Wolves have stolen a march in a race to sign the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>Rondon, who is representing Venezuela in this summer’s Copa America, has a £16.5million release clause and has just one year remaining on his contract at the Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>After failing to win promotion to the Premier League, the Baggies are desperate to offload Rondon and the Express and Star claim it is Wolves who have made the most ground in talks.</p>
      <p>Nuno Esperito Santo is keen for forward Raul Jimenez to have some healthy competition next season, particularly given Wolves’ Europa League commitments.</p>
      <p>However, the report claims they are also monitoring a number of younger forward targets as possible alternatives to Rondon.</p>
      <p>At the end of the season it was believed Newcastle was Rondon’s number one choice this summer. However, the report also claims that the former Malaga and Zenit St Petersburg star WOULD be interested in a move to Molineux.</p>
      <p>West Ham and Everton are also thought to hold an interest in Rondon.</p>

      <p>The 22-year-old Colombian scored 30 goals for Rangers this season and with Rafa Benitez keen to boost his goalscoring options this summer if he stays, the report describes Morelos as Benitez’s ‘key objective’.</p>
      <p>Morelos is expected to leave Ibrox this summer and the reports claims a fee of just under £5m should secure his services.</p>
      <p>However, reports in Scotland claim a bid of at least £20million will be required to prise him away from Glasgow.</p>
      <h4>Sebastien Haller (Eintracht Frankfurt)</h4>
      <p>
        <b>July: Signed for West Ham</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to German publication the FR, Newcastle and West Ham are monitoring the 24-year-old.</p>
      <p>Haller scored 20 goals for Frankfurt last season and he is a player Newcastle have watched before but were put off by his price tag.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Rafa Benitez has always been a far of Australian Aaron Mooy, and Newcastle have been linked to him countless times since winning promotion back to the Premier League in 2016-17.</p>
      <p>They came up with Huddersfield that year but the Terriers' stay in the top flight has come to end, and Mooy is now attracting interest.</p>
      <p>Respectable Australian media outlet The World Game, is reporting that Newcastle is one of six teams looking at the midfielder.</p>
      <p>They put a £20 million price on his head - which would be steep for a Newcastle's transfer policy, especially given the fact he turns 29 in September.</p>

      <p>Newcastle United are interested in signing Benfica goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos, according to reports in Portugal.</p>
      <p>O Jogo claim the Magpies have made contact with the Portuguese giants - who reportedly value the Greek international at more than £13m.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Newcastle have scouted Vlachodimos a number of times this season as they look for competition for the first-choice Martin Dubravka.</p>

      <p>The Sun claim United are one of three Premier League clubs interested in the 25-year-old defender, who has impressed in the Eredivisie this season.</p>
      <p>Kanon has a contract until 2022 but his valuation is just £3million which would allow Premier League clubs to swoop. The centre-back will play in the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast and is also attracting interest from Leicester, West Ham and Crystal Palace.</p>

      <p>We are just a few weeks away from the transfer window and Newcastle United speculation is beginning to build ahead of a summer where the manager - be that Rafa Benitez or someone else - has been promised £50million to spend. Here are our top transfer stories at the moment:</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>The report in the Sun claims Benitez is interested in the player as "back up" for Fabian Schar and Jamaal Lascelles - although our understanding is that centre-back isn't a priority for Newcastle this summer if the Spaniard stays. He has Fede Fernandez who can also fill in at centre-back while Paul Dummett was being utilised as one of the three central defenders in Newcastle's starting XI last term.</p>
      <h4>Mario Fernandes - (CSKA Moscow)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article13999597.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/GettyImages-886474656.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Rafa Benitez is 'weighing up' a bid for full-back Mario Fernandes according to the Daily Star. The report claims that the bid would be in the region £27 million but he is the 'latest of several candidates being looked at.'</p>
      <p>Our NUFC writer Chris Waugh understands that Fernandes is a player that United are aware of but the Russian's age and price tag 'sets alarm bells ringing immediately.'</p>
      <h4>Joe Bryan - (Fulham)</h4>

      <p>Rafa Benitez is considering a move for Fulham's left-back Joe Bryan - who he looked at signing last summer.</p>
      <p>The West-London side beat the Magpies to the deal but following their relegation may struggle to hold onto some of their players.</p>
      <p>Football Insider claim that Benitez likes the look of Bryan due to his versatility, and the club may make a move.</p>
      <h4>Juan Mata (Manchester United)</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>
        <b>June 2019: Mata signed a new deal until 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>Juan Mata is available on a free this summer as his time at MUFC comes to end - he’s unlikely to be offered a new deal, and that has alerted several clubs.</p>
      <p><b>The Sun </b>reports that Benitez wants to bring the 31-year-old to St James’ Park this summer but it will depend on the hierarchy at NUFC being flexible especially given the age and wage - a reported £140,000 per-week - of the Spaniard. Benitez and Mata worked together at Chelsea.</p>
      <h4>Mehdi Zerkane (AS Monaco)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16314388.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-858134704-1.jpg"/>

      <p>L’Equipe claim that NUFC have held discussions for 19-year-old Mehdi Zerkane. The report claims talks have been held, and NUFC are waiting to sort out the future of Rafa Benitez before progressing with the deal. Our understanding is that these claims are wide of the mark.</p>
      <h4>Joao Mario (Inter Milan)</h4>

        <figcaption>Joao Mario of FC Internazionale in action during the Serie A</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Media outlet InterLive claim that Newcastle will be offered Joao Mario. The report claims that Mario’s agents have approached NUFC to see whether they would be interested in the former West Ham loanee.</p>
      <h4>Jetro Willems (Frankfurt)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article15591597.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_SS-Lazio-v-Eintracht-Frankfurt-UEFA-Europa-League-Group-H.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Left-back Jetro Willems is a name familiar to Newcastle fans, as he was constantly linked with a move to Tyneside during his PSV days. Instead he ended up at Frankfurt but is now set to be leave, and when asked (20.05) if Newcastle were interested in him alongside several other clubs, the 25-year-old said: "There is interest from those clubs."</p>
      <h4>Kalvin Phillips and Jack Clarke (Leeds United)</h4>
      <p>
        <b>July 2019: Jack Clarke joined Spurs</b>
      </p>
      <p>TEAMtalk claim that United are interested in Kalvin Phillips and Jack Clarke.</p>
      <p>The media outlet report that United may push to get Dwight Gayle as part of any deal after West Brom confirmed they would not be signing the striker on a permanent deal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kevin Trapp (PSG)</b>
      </p>
      <p>28-year-old German goalkeeper Trapp has been on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt this season but his agent Pini Zahavi is touting him around Europe as he looks set to return to the French capital.</p>

      <p>United have been mentioned as a possible destination by Paris United, a website dedicated to PSG transfer news. And while United are on the look out for a goalkeeper, it's very doubtful they would commit financially to signing a player like Trapp while they have Martin Dubravka on the books.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stanley N'Soki (PSG)</b>
      </p>
      <p>N'Soki is a talented left-back with real potential and Newcastle made a real effort to sign him in the last summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>Now Paris United claims that N'Soki is back on Newcastle's radar - and Get French Football News lists them as one of four clubs interested in the 20-year-old, who may leave PSG this summer as they look to satisfy Financial Fair Play regulations.</p>

      <p>Newcastle United have been linked with a move for forward Remi Oudin in L’Equipe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Transferts-remi-oudin-reims-a-des-pretendants/1017593">The report</a> claims that the 22-year-old forward has a contract until 2021 and Newcastle will have to pay €12 million for his services.</p>
      <p>A club with Newcastle’s resources should be able to pay that kind of money for a talented player.</p>
      <p>Oudin has been likened to the former <a href="https://sportslens.com/tags/competitions/english-premier-league/">Premier League</a> striker <a href="https://sportslens.com/tags/people/robin-van-persie/">Robin Van Persie</a> because of his playing style and his clinical presence in the penalty box.</p>

      <p>Turkish Football report that Newcastle, Everton and Celtic are monitoring the striker.</p>
      <h4>Tammy Abraham</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Newcastle have been linked with Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham.</p>
      <p>The Northern Echo claim Newcastle are interested in signing the striker, if Chelsea are willing to cash in on the young striker.</p>
      <p>Abraham has been on loan at Aston Villa this season and has fired an impressive 25 goals in 37 games.</p>
      <p>Abraham is just 21 and a former target of Rafa Benitez back in the summer of 2017 after promotion from the Championship. Back then the young striker chose Swansea over Newcastle and ended up having a poor season in the top flight as the Welsh club were relegated.</p>
      <p>But perhaps Benitez’s interest in the youngster is still there, if the report is to be believed.</p>
      <p>The issue is that the report suggests Newcastle want a permanent transfer, rather than a loan, and it’s highly unlikely Chelsea will be willing to allow such a young talent to depart for a reasonable price that Mike Ashley is likely to sanction. The price is likely to be mouth-watering to convince the Blues to sell.</p>
      <h4>Rafa Silva (Benfica)</h4>

      <p>Newcastle United are interested in signing Benfica winger Rafa Silva, according to the Portugal international's agent.</p>
      <p>It is no secret that Magpies manager <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Rafa Benitez</a> will be looking to recruit at least one winger this summer, should the Spaniard sign a new contract on Tyneside, given that on-loan wideman <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/kenedy">Kenedy</a> is almost certain to return to Chelsea.</p>
      <p>United are understood to have tracked a host of wingers across Europe, and their scouting team have regularly taken in matches in Portugal, including several in which Benfica have been involved.</p>

      <p>The left-back's contract is up this summer and reports from The Sun claim United are at the front of the queue to sign him on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has impressed in the Champions Leagueg and has played a crucial role in the club's title charge.</p>
      <p>Several teams including Watford and Inter Milan have reportedly been tracking Benito but the report claims United are favourites to sign him.</p>
      <h4>Dorukhan Tokoz</h4>
      <p>Newcastle United have been scouting Besiktas midfielder Dorukhan Tokoz, although he failed to impress on their latest visit.</p>
      <p>Turkish outlet Askam claim two Toon scouts were at the game against Galatasaray at the weekend and were left disappointed with how the midfielder performed in the game.</p>
      <p>However, the report claims that Newcastle have been following Tokoz closely throughout the second half of the season and will continue to do so.</p>
      <p>West Ham have also been linked with the 22-year-old midfielder with Besiktas reportedly willing to sell due to financial difficulties.</p>

      <p>Newcastle United have been monitoring Coventry City midfielder Tom Bayliss ahead of a possible summer move.</p>
      <p>The young central midfielder has excelled for the Sky Blues since breaking into the first team last season and the 20-year-old is said to also be attracting interest from Brighton, Leeds and Middlesbrough.</p>
      <h4>Andreas Samaris (Benfica)</h4>
      <p>Newcastle almost signed the Greek international midfielder in January but a move fell through.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old is set to be out of contract during the summer and the Magpies reportedly sent scouts to watch him during their 5-1 win over Portimonense over the weekend.</p>
      <p>With the futures of Jonjo Shelvey, Mo Diame and Isaac Hayden unclear, it could be a cheap option for the Magpies to explore in the central midfield department.</p>

      <h4>Jan Carlos Hurtado (Gimnasia)</h4>
      <p>According to reports in Venezuela, Newcastle are showing interest in striker Jan Carlos Hurtado.</p>
      <p>The reports come from Venezuelan media and have been picked up Foot-Sur7 in France because Marseille and Atlanta United are also named as clubs tracking the 19-year-old.</p>
      <p>Currently at Gimnasia in the Argentinian top flight, he’s scored two goals in 17 appearances this season (largely from the bench) and is seen as a huge prospect who could be available for a minimal price this summer.</p>
      <p>He earned his first international cap in March and continues to impress in South America, with a move to Europe seeming inevitable.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his future and possibility of an exit this summer, he said: "They have several proposals from Europe but still nothing concrete. There are many clubs interested but I hope the best offer is to be able to stay and have continuity."</p>

      <h4>Kenedy (Chelsea - on loan at Newcastle)</h4>
      <p>Kenedy has not enjoyed a good season on loan at Newcastle this time around and it seems unlikely the Brazilian will be made a permanent signing this summer.</p>
      <h4>Dwight McNeil (Burnley)</h4>

      <p>Reports in the Daily Star claim that United have scouted the 19-year-old midfielder who has impressed this season.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, Man City and Everton have also said to have looked at Burnley player who has a contract until 2023.</p>
      <p>With Isaac Hayden, Mo Diame and possibly Jonjo Shelvey leaving in the summer - United are in need of a new midfielders.</p>

      <p>The former Sheffield United man has had a cracking start to life in the Premier League - seven goals and five assists in 28 games.</p>
      <p>Reports suggested United have run the rule over him, but given he's got a contract until 2022, it would not be the cheapest of deals.</p>
      <h4>Patrick Erra (Nurenberg)</h4>

      <p>According to German media outelt BILD, United have approached Nurenberg midfielder Patrick Erras. The 24-year-old’s contract runs out in 2020 - and may be available for as little as £5million.</p>
      <p>He's been reported as saying: "My contract expires in 2020, of course leaving crosses your mind. </p>
      <p>"I can confirm that clubs from the Premier League and the Bundesliga have already approached my advisor. But my first point of contact will always be the club."</p>
      <h4>Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth)</h4>

      <p>National reports claim that Matt Ritchie will be offered as 'bait' for a cash-plus-player deal for Ryan Fraser.</p>
      <p>The winger, who has six goals and ten assists this season, is entering the last 12 months of his contract.</p>
      <p>United considered selling Ritchie last summer but Rafa Benitez opted against the sale, and the Scotsman has been nearly ever present this season.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest that he wants top six football - Arsenal are said to be interested.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Lee Ryder's verdict: Newcastle have looked at a host of wingers this season, including Ryan Fraser. But whether a swap deal with Matt Ritchie would work financially is another question. Ritchie's value was around £20million last summer when Stoke were asking.</i>

      <p>The former Arsenal man has been in superb form this year but has revealed that he still intends to leave the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Hayden wanted to leave United last summer to be closer to his family, but no deal was forthcoming.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/05/07/isaac-hayden-determined-leave-newcastle-united-summer/">The Telegraph report</a> that West Ham, Brighton and Norwich are interested in the former England under-21 star, while Mail Online report that Watford and Crystal Palace are also keen.</p>

      <p>Il Corriere dello Sport claim that Inter are monitoring Ayoze Perez and have been doing so for ‘many months.’ A price of £15m-£20m has been touted.</p>
      <p>The Northern Echo claim he's wanted by Napoli, while it is understood a host of La Liga clubs are also interested in the Spaniard. While Perez is not desperate to leave Newcastle this summer <a href="https://t.co/liMj7PPY2c">he has hinted that he could be open to a move away.</a></p>
      <p>Reports in Italy claim that intermediaries from Perez's camp have revealed Napoli would be his preferred choice of club in Italy.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mo Diame's Newcastle United contract ends at the end of the season, and the 31-year-old's future is up in the air.</p>
      <p>He failed to start the necessary to trigger a contract extension clause of one-year and it's understood that the midfielder would like a two-year-deal.</p>
      <p>Diame has openly stated his frustration at the situation telling Chronicle Live: "We know what they want for this club; it’s difficult to get an extension when you are over 30 here."</p>
      <p>Leeds Live report that Leeds United are now looking at Mo Diame, while reports in Greece suggest Olympiakos are keen on a move.</p>
      <p>There is also said to be interest from clubs in the Premier League and the Turkish Super Lig.</p>

      <p>Joselu has struggled for goals this season and has barely been seen during the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>There was reported interest from the Chinese Super League during the January transfer window and it will be interesting to see whether that resurfaces.</p>
      <p>He has also been linked with Spanish side Deportivo Alaves in recent days.</p>
