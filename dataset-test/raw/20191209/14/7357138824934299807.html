      <p>Sandwich chain <a href="https://www.jimmyjohns.com/">Jimmy John’s</a> announced Monday (Dec. 9) the launch of its first customer-loyalty program.</p>
      <p>Freaky Fast Reward, now available nationwide, was tested earlier this year and rolled out on a limited basis, resulting in more than 1.8 million members who have already signed up. For those just joining the program, Jimmy John’s is offering a free 8-inch sandwich after their first order. All members can earn various rewards, including sandwiches, sides, drinks and exclusive first-taste access to new products.</p>
      <p>“At Jimmy John’s, we have amazing customers, and we’re committed to rewarding them for their loyalty,” Chief Marketing Officer John Shea said in an emailed press release. “Freaky Fast Rewards is a best-in-class program that makes earning rewards fast and easy.”</p>
      <p>Freaky Fast Rewards features one-tap technology that allows members to make purchases via Apple Pay or Google Pay. In addition, the program is fully integrated into Jimmy John’s website and mobile app, where members can track their progress toward their next reward.</p>
      <p>Since the pilot launch in March, Freaky Fast Rewards has led to 1,724,623 total rewards redeemed; 50,000 free Little John sandwiches to support October’s national product launch; 268,893 birthdays celebrated with a free sandwich; 24,881 sandwiches given away on Nov. 3, National Sandwich Day; 18,512 pickles given away on Nov. 14, National Pickle Day; and 100,925 free sides earned on this past Cyber Monday (Dec. 2).</p>
      <p>“We’re just getting started and it’s already clear that Freaky Fast Rewards is providing value to our customers and improving the customer experience.” said Shea. “To show our customers love, we’re giving them a free sandwich after their first order, just for signing up, and will continue to dream up sandwich-fueled rewards to surprise and delight our customers in the future.”</p>
      <p>Jimmy John’s has nearly 2,800 locations across 43 states. In September there were <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/walmart-health-career-path-inspire-brands-to-buy-jimmy-johns/">reports</a> that <a href="https://inspirebrands.com/">Inspire Brands</a> was planning to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/inspire-brands-acquires-jimmy-johns-sandwich-chain/">acquire</a> Jimmy John’s for an undisclosed price in a deal that would make it the fourth-largest restaurant company in the country.</p>
