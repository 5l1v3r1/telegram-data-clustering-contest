      <h1>Works restart at Forrestania Nickel Operation in Western Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:30:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mining-technology.com/author/ghimaja/" target="_blank">Himaja</a></address>
      <p>Nickel mining firm Western Areas has resumed normal operations at its Forrestania project in Western Australia, following a bush fire incident last week.</p>
      <p>The Forrestania Nickel Operation is located 400km east of Perth.</p>
      <p>Western Areas noted that the bush fire incident, which likely took place due to a lightning strike, led to the temporary suspension of Forrestania operations last week.</p>
      <p>The company added that the mains power was interrupted during the weekend as a result of damage to three power lines. The power was restored by the weekend and mining operations were restarted on site using back-up power generation.</p>
      <p>Operations at the Cosmic Boy mill were suspended until the power transmission was restored.</p>
      <p>The incident, however, does not have any impact on the company’s nickel production or cost guidance for the 2020 financial year.</p>
      <p>At the time of the incident, Western Areas said: “No mining or infrastructure assets have sustained damage and normal operations are expected to resume imminently.”</p>
      <p>Forrestania Nickel Operation (FNO) Response Team and various firefighting teams have assisted towards the safe resumption of operation at Forrestania.</p>
      <p>Constructed and designed by GR Engineering Services, the Cosmic Bay concentrator uses conventional flotation technology to process ore into nickel concentrate with an average grade of 14% nickel.</p>
      <p>Flying Fox is the first mine to be developed at the Forrestania project, which contains some of the highest grade nickel in the world.</p>
      <p>Western Areas opened the Forrestania Nickel Concentrate Plant in March 2009. The nickel concentrator at Cosmic Boy treats high-grade nickel ore from Flying Fox.</p>
