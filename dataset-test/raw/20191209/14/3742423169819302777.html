      <p>Growing up, most males are never given a rundown on how or what they should do to keep their penis clean. Beyond washing it with water, is there anything else you need to be doing?</p>
      <p>It’s a shame some people think talking about cleaning and caring for our genitals is embarrassing or taboo. We probably know more about hair care than penis care.</p>
      <p>The penis is simply another part of our anatomy, so cleaning should be relatively straight forward.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been circumcised, where your foreskin was removed soon after birth, your penis will look something like the one in the diagram (below, right), with the head (or glans) always exposed.</p>
      <p>But if you have a foreskin (below left and centre), there are some extra things to think about when washing, which we’ll get to soon.</p>
