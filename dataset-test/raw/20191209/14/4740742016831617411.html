      <p>A working farm run by a learning disability charity has "lost almost everything" after thieves stole a van, cash and equipment including power tools and lawnmowers.</p>
      <p>Elm Tree Farm, a social enterprise in Bristol run by the Brandon Trust, was targeted over the weekend (December 7 and 8).</p>
      <p>The money taken included proceeds from the sale of Christmas trees and logs were also stolen.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Sue Porto said: “We are shocked, sickened and dismayed to have been targeted like this.</p>
      <p>"Elm Tree Farm offers vital opportunities for individuals to learn work skills and have a paid job, something which far too few people with a learning disability have access to.</p>
      <p>"Coming to the farm also has an invaluable impact on people in terms of enabling them to build confidence and make friends.</p>
      <p>"A crime like this is utterly devastating for everyone who benefits from the work we do here."</p>
      <p>Around 50 people with learning disabilities and autism work at the 37-acre farm in Stapleton which has a cattle, lambs and pigs as well as fruit and vegetable patches.</p>
      <p>The charity is now appealing for help.</p>
      <p>Ms Porto said: “As well as appealing for any information which could help the police, we would also like to reach out to any businesses that could kindly donate equipment and tools so we can get back on our feet as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>"Elm Tree Farm has lost almost everything, so any help will be greatly appreciated by us all.”</p>
      <p>Avon and Somerset Police is investigating the burglary.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "We're investigating following a burglary at Elm Tree Far, Park Road, which happened some time over the weekend.</p>
      <p>"A number of sheds and workshops have been broken into and a number of items, including various tools, have been taken.</p>
      <p>"Specialist crime scene investigators have examined the area and enquiries are ongoing.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area over the weekend is asked to call 101, providing the call handler with the reference 5219282417."</p>
      <p>Anyone who can help the charity should contact it on <a href="mailto:info@brandontrust.org">info@brandontrust.org</a></p>
