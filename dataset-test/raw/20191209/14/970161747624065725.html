      <h1>Frank Lampard sends message to Chelsea fans over January transfers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:23:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author">Metro Sport Reporter</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> insists he will not be ‘too reactionary’ in the January window following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>’s defeat to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/everton-fc/">Everton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lampard’s side have lost three out of their last four <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> matches and a 3-1 defeat away to Everton has allowed their rivals to close the gap on fourth place even more.</p>
      <p>Last week, it was confirmed that Chelsea’s transfer ban has been lifted, which means they will be able to sign players in the January window.</p>
      <p>But Lampard has stressed that he will not dictate his transfer plans based on his side’s recent run of results.</p>
      <p>‘I think you’ve got to be careful about being too reactionary – ban lifted and defeat to Everton – it’s quite easy to come to that conclusion,’ said Lampard.</p>

      <p>‘Just as much as people at the start of the season who were saying we’ve got all these young boys, this is going to be no problem, we don’t need any players.</p>
      <p>‘I think at a club like Chelsea there needs to be a balance. You have a strong squad which I believe we have but you have to look at can we strengthen.</p>
      <p>‘And there will time times going forward, whether it’s January or next summer, of course we’re going to look at an opportunity to strengthen because we want to improve.’</p>
      <p>Asked if his perception has changed following his side’s recent run, Lampard replied: ‘No, it doesn’t change it at all but you do learn as you go along with your players, you learn every day in training, you learn in games.</p>
      <p>‘It certainly hasn’t changed my mindset right now, I was the same going into Everton.</p>
      <p>‘That’s always pretty fluid, I haven’t got an exact, ‘I need this, this and this’, you look at the squad as you go along.</p>
      <p>‘I wouldn’t say my mind was set on anything to be changed.</p>

      <p>‘But you do learn from your players in tough times, not just in terms of what they do on the pitch but in terms of how their personality is.</p>
      <p>‘That’s what the disappointment with Everton was.</p>
      <p>‘It wasn’t just we were off on the ball, we were a little bit, but more than that I didn’t like the fact there were individual contact moments throughout the game that we lost.</p>
      <p>‘So that’s a personality thing more than anything else.’</p>
