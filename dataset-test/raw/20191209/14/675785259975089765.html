      <p>A police officer accused of murdering former Aston Villa star Dalian Atkinson will stand trial in September next year alongside a colleague who denies assaulting the ex-footballer.</p>
      <p>Pc Benjamin Monk, 41, and his colleague Pc Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, 29, appeared in Birmingham Crown Court today for a plea and trial preparation hearing.</p>
      <p>Mr Monk was not required to enter pleas to a count of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter, while Ms Bettley-Smith entered a not guilty plea to a charge alleging that she assaulted Mr Atkinson occasioning actual bodily harm prior to his death on August 15 2016.</p>

      <p>Judge Melbourne Inman QC granted both officers unconditional bail until a further hearing in May next year, and fixed a trial date for September 14 at Birmingham Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Mr Atkinson, who also played for the likes of Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday, was tasered by police near his father's house in Telford, Shropshire, in 2016, and died a few hours later after going into cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>His family claimed after his death that the taser device was deployed at least three times and relatives said Mr Atkinson was suffering from ill health and had a weak heart.</p>
      <p>In a statement following Mr Atkinson's death his siblings described him as a "kind, caring and protective brother."</p>

      <p>They also added: "He always brought life and energy to family gatherings- When Dalian turned up, we knew there would be laughter and banter."</p>
      <p>A number of high-profile figures also paid their respects on social media following his death, with former England defender Sol Campbell tweeting: "What?! Former @AVFCOfficial footballer Dalian Atkinson tasered?! Shocked &amp; saddened by this news. Thoughts with friends &amp; family. #RIPDalian"</p>
