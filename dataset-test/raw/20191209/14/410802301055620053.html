      <p>TIME: 30 MINUTES</p>
      <p>YIELD: 4 SERVINGS</p>
      <p>1 1⁄2 pounds brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved</p>
      <p>3 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>1⁄4 cup roughly chopped walnuts</p>
      <p>2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds, plus more to taste</p>
      <p>Pomegranate molasses, for drizzling (optional)</p>
      <p>Flaky salt, to serve</p>
      <p>1. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, toss brussels sprouts with the olive oil. Season well with the salt and black pepper and toss again. Spread everything evenly on a sheet pan cut-side down and roast until crisp and deeply golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes, flipping the sprouts halfway through to ensure even browning.</p>
      <p>2. Meanwhile, toast the walnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently to ensure they don’t burn, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>
      <p>3. When the brussels sprouts are done roasting, toss them with the toasted walnuts and the pomegranate seeds. Drizzle with the pomegranate molasses (about 1 teaspoon or so), if using. Season with flaky salt.</p>
