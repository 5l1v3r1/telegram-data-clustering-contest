      <p>The last game, <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/12/scribbletaku-1194/">clearly</a>, was <i>Oblivion</i>. A game from a time where box art was a little more iconic - or at least remembered a hell of a lot more strongly - than today.</p>
      <p>Today's drawing comes from the lovely Vanna, which explains why the quality has ramped up massively. Be interesting to see how you all go with this one, although I have a feeling you'll have no qualms guessing what it is.</p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
