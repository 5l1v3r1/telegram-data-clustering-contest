      <h1>Watch Elon Musk Jump A Red Light In Tesla Cybertruck</h1>
      <h2>Tesla CEO exits a high-end restaurant by knocking over a cone then jumping a red light.</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is not expected to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/telsa-moves-up-cybertruck-production-date">enter production until 2021</a>, which is why residents of Los Angeles were in for a big surprise when the electric truck was spotted driving around local roads. Those who were able to get close to the truck got an even bigger shock when they noticed who was driving - Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Some people may be wondering how Tesla was already able to get the Cybertruck out on the road but keen-eyed observers noticed the truck was spotted wearing a manufacturer plate, meaning the company is allowed to drive it on the road even if it isn't production-ready.</p>
      <p>Speaking of production-ready, it looks like Tesla has already made a few<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-modifications-keep-coming-way-before-2021-deliveries"> tweaks to the design</a>, including the one-piece headlight design, which now features two brighter headlights that stand out over the connected light stript between them. The taillights too having seemingly been changed since the Cybertruck debuted on stage and now appear to be more segmented into three distinct pieces.</p>

      <p>Musk was spotted departing Japanese restaurant Nobu in the Cybertruck followed by a Tesla Model S (likely filled with engineers). We don't know what platform underpins the truck Musk was seen in, but since it is so far from production, we assume it is a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-x">Model X </a>drivetrain underneath. Driving the Cybertruck around LA is likely a publicity stunt for Tesla, but just like the unbreakable window test, this latest stunt didn't go without a hilarious gaffe.</p>

      <p>When leaving the restaurant, Musk smacks down a road sign, which should have been easily avoidable, before jumping a red light and swerving into traffic. Potential buyers are already concerned that the CyberTruck may be <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-designers-made-a-major-miscalculation">too large to fit in their garage</a>. They should be equally concerned by the amount of body roll the truck demonstrates as it sprints to beat the oncoming traffic.</p>
