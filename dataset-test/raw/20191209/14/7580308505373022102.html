Tahrir square has become an art hub, a rare space for free expression in a country where conservative tribes, paramilitary forces and powerful politicians have at various points tried to snuff out criticism.

      <p>Iraqis turned out Monday to mourn a prominent activist gunned down the previous evening, the latest violent episode in anti-government demonstrations in which more than 450 people have died.</p>
      <p>Adding to the tension, a volley of rockets wounded six Iraqi soldiers on a military base near the Baghdad airport hosting US troops and American diplomats.</p>
      <p>Iraq’s capital and its Shiite-majority south have been gripped by more than two months of rallies against corruption, poor public services and a lack of jobs.</p>
      <p>One prominent civil society activist, Fahem al-Tai, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Iraq’s shrine city of Karbala late Sunday while returning home from protests.</p>
      <p>Hundreds joined his funeral procession Monday, carrying 53-year-old Tai’s coffin through the city streets.</p>
      <p>“We will not forget our martyrs,” read one sign carried by tearful protesters.</p>
      <p>His death came just days after an attack on a protest encampment in Baghdad left 20 demonstrators and four police officers dead, sparking nationwide outrage.</p>
      <p>Gunmen had stormed a parking complex near the capital’s iconic Tahrir Square where anti-regime youths have been camped out since early October.</p>
      <p>Although the violence raged for hours, government security forces deployed nearby did not intervene.</p>
      <p>The British, French and German ambassadors to Iraq condemned the attack in a meeting with caretaker premier Adel Abdel Mahdi, who resigned on December 1.</p>
      <p>“No armed group should be able to operate outside of the control of the state,” the envoys said in a statement, urging the government to “urgently investigate”.</p>
      <p><b>Hashed ordered to stay away </b><br/>The envoys pressed the government to implement its recent order that the Hashed al-Shaabi security force “stay away from protest locations”.</p>
      <p>The Hashed, founded in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group, is made up of mostly-Shiite factions, many of which have been backed by Iran.</p>
      <p>The network is incorporated into Iraq’s state security apparatus and its head, Faleh al-Fayyadh, is also the national security advisor to the prime minister.</p>
      <p>After protests broke out in October, the Hashed initially backed the government but switched sides as Abdel Mahdi came under growing pressure from the street and Iraq’s Shiite religious authority.</p>
      <p>Protesters have been wary of the Hashed, however, fearing their presence in the rallies could derail their cause.</p>
      <p>Following Friday’s attack, Fayyadh ordered Hashed factions to keep their distance from the rallies.</p>
      <p>In addition to those killed, dozens of protesters went missing after the attack on the parking complex and have yet to resurface, their relatives told AFP.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators have for weeks complained of being monitored, threatened and harassed in an intimidation campaign meant to keep them from pursuing their movement.</p>
      <p>In one particularly gruesome case last week, the bruised body of 19-year-old Zahra Ali was left outside her family home in Baghdad, hours after she had gone missing.</p>
      <p>On Friday, relatives of Zeid al-Khafaji, a 22-year-old photographer, said he had been abducted while returning from Tahrir Square in the capital.</p>
      <p><b>New rocket attacks </b><br/>Since October 1, the youth-led rallies have not only accused the ruling class of being inept and corrupt but also of being heavily influenced by neighbouring Iran.</p>
      <p>Baghdad has close ties with both Tehran and its arch-foe Washington, which led the 2003 invasion that toppled Iraq’s former dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>
      <p>Some 5,200 US troops are still based across Iraq and are facing a spike in rocket attacks on their positions.</p>
      <p>There have been at least nine attacks against US targets in Iraq in the span of six weeks.</p>
      <p>The latest in the early hours of Monday saw four rockets slam into an Iraqi base that hosts a small contingent of US forces next to Baghdad International Airport.</p>
      <p>Six Iraqi troops were wounded, according to the military.</p>
      <p>Security sources said they belong to the Counter-Terrorism Service, an elite unit created and trained by US forces.</p>
      <p>No American forces were wounded in the recent salvoes.</p>
      <p>And while there have been no claims of responsibility, US defence officials have blamed several of the attacks on Iran-backed factions in Iraq.</p>
      <p>Tensions between Iran and the US have soared since last year, when Washington pulled out of a landmark nuclear agreement with Tehran and reimposed crippling sanctions.</p>
      <p>Baghdad — whose many security forces have been trained by either the US or Iran — is worried about being caught in the middle of the bitter dispute.</p>
      <p>Iraqi officials are meanwhile also struggling with their domestic political crisis.</p>
      <p>President Barham Saleh has until December 17 to name a replacement premier, and political parties are deep in talks to agree on a consensus candidate.</p>
