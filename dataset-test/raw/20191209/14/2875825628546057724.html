      <h2>Lisa Armstrong, who is in the process of divorcing Ant McPartlin on the grounds of his adultery, let slip she's been watching the jungle show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:06:34+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Lisa Armstrong has dropped a major hint she's been glued to the twists and turns of the I'm A Celebrity jungle - despite it being fronted by her estranged husband, Ant McPartlin.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> makeup supremo liked a tweet about the show, suggesting she's been watching even though she and Ant are in the middle of bitter divorce rows.</p>
      <p>"Hats off to @sherlikemp and <a href="https://twitter.com/realmartinkemp">@realmartinkemp</a> for bringing up such a lovely young man in <a href="https://twitter.com/romankemp">@romankemp</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iamaceleb?src=hashtag_click">#iamaceleb</a> ," read the tweet from journalist Lorraine Candy, which Lisa added to her liked column.</p>
      <p>It comes after Lisa had to sit by and watch as Ant paraded his new love Anne-Marie Corbett in Australia's Gold Coast, having flown Down Under for years as his wife.</p>

      <p>Ant and Anne-Marie stayed in a private apartment next door to Declan Donnelly, his wife Ali Astall and their daughter Isla, while Lisa was back home in London awaiting the next step in her and Ant's divorce war.</p>
      <p>Even though she's been keeping a dignified silence since their split in late 2017, Lisa has made it clear she won't be gagged with a non-disclosure agreement in order to reach a financial settlement with her ex.</p>
      <p>He's said to have tried everything in order to prevent her from talking about their marriage, but the most recent talks between their lawyers failed shortly before he and Anne-Marie jetted to Australia.</p>

      <p>It is now looking increasingly likely their Â£62million break-up will be settled in court - potentially leading to full exposure of what went on behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Sources have blamed Ant's booze battle, gruelling work schedules and the two stars simply growing apart for their relationship crumbling.</p>
      <p>Another insider claimed weeks spent apart at the end of each year was a huge factor in Ant and Lisa parting ways after 23 years as a couple.</p>

      <p>But she has been trying to move on with her life since finding out Ant was dating her former close friend and personal assistant.</p>
      <p>Lisa was this month awarded a Royal Television Society Craft Award for her work on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> .</p>
      <p>She looked super proud as she posed for a photo with her gong in a pair of sweet snaps she shared to her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account.</p>
      <p>In the photo, Lisa donned a chic black dress with a cape-style high neck that also flared on the sleeves.</p>
      <p>Her blonde locks were worn in a sleek up do and parted down the middle.</p>
      <p>"So this actually happened..... so so happy!!!" she wrote.</p>
      <p>"Totally overwhelmed and thrilled all rolled into one....#rtscraftawards x."</p>
