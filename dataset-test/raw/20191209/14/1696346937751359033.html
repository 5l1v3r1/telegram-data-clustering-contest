      <h3>Investors Start Receiving Their Shares</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/e66sjz/moocowupdate_developing_story_more_and_more/">euphoric Reddit post</a>, entitled “Developing story: More and more people reporting they are receiving their shares back,” Dash supporters come out in numbers to rejoice about the magic return of their long lost funds.</p>

      <p>“Moo has finally been woken from his slumber,” commented one, “and is currently sending the money back to its rightful owners.”</p>
      <p>Another jubilant Reddit user wrote, “Sweeeeet!!! This is the comeback of the year!! MooCow for president! :)”</p>
      <p>Even the original user on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/making-a-dash-for-it-moocowmoo-disappears/">Dash Forum</a> cited by <i>Bitcoinist</i> last Monday, Erulian, confirmed that his funds had been returned and apologized for causing so much kerfuffle. </p>
      <blockquote>I’m sorry it turned into such a big drama, but also glad that I finally got my funds back. I’m sure some people in the community pulled some strings to make this happen. Thank you.</blockquote>
      <p>Despite his words of thanks, however, Erulian failed to provide any concrete evidence of the returned funds, citing privacy concerns.</p>
      <h3>Dash Core Group Shares Evidence of Moocowmoo Payments</h3>
      <p>“Thank you to all the dedicated and anger-driven investigators and “exit scam”-yelling news outlets with an irrational hate towards Dash who helped people get their money back!”, the Reddit post opens.</p>
      <p>At <i>Bitcoinist, </i>we couldn’t be happier to hear that justice is finally being done. Was it our investigative article, though, or perhaps a Christmas miracle that got Moo to do the right thing? We simply do not know.</p>
      <p>Maybe it was something else. Either way, it’s great to hear that investors have had their hard-earned funds returned. The overall situation seems to have been nothing more of a case of wanton disregard for investors’ funds rather than a daylight swindle. </p>
      <p>Below is the evidence provided by Dash Core Group, which they state shows that Moocowmoo has been returning funds to Dash investors.</p>

      <p>In closing, Dash Core Group CMO, Fernando Gutierrez, concluded,</p>
      <blockquote>This doesn’t make things good again because it should not have taken so much for him to send back the funds, but it is certainly a much better outcome than him disappearing without paying.</blockquote>
