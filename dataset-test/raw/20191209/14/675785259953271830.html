      <h1>Katie Price says Dane Bowers was the 'love of my life' in awkward flirting match</h1>
      <h2>Katie Price told her ex boyfriend Dane Bowers exactly what she thought of him during a messy night out together which ended in an awkward flirting moment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:59:44+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price flirts with her ex flame Dane Bowers on a night out and tells him he was the love of her life during her new show My Crazy Life.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model, 41, is back up to her old tricks again in the new TV show that highlights parts of her showbiz lifestyle.</p>
      <p>She visited London club Jakata and was invited by one of Bowers' pals to support his new band Boyz On Block in October and Katie ended being kicked out by security.</p>
      <p>The once loved-up pair began flirting at the start of the night as a flustered Katie ran over and gushed: "Oh Dane how are you my darling?"</p>
      <p>She continued: "You was a really good singer and a really good dancer, why do you think I fell for you?"</p>
      <p>Dane tried to deny Katie's flirty comments, but she insisted: "You can dance. When you was fat, you could dance. You was fat back in the day and I loved you when you was like that. And you broke my heart."</p>

      <p>She turned around to his friend and told him: "I loved him so much, he was the love of my life then."</p>
      <p>An awkward Dane asked her: "Are you married now?" before she replied: "I'm single, I'm single."</p>
      <p>He then told the camera crew to not let her have any shots, which Katie didn't like.</p>
