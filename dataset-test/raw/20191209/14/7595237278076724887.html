      <p>A garda has gone on trial charged with assaulting an RTÉ cameraman and causing damage to his camera.</p>
      <p>Sean Lucey, who has been stationed at Crumlin Village and Sundrive Road garda stations in Dublin, has pleaded not guilty to assaulting cameraman, Colm Hand in the city centre on 6 February, 2016.  He has also denied damaging a camera.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting counsel, Fiona McGowan said the allegations against Mr Lucey had been investigated by the Garda Siochána Ombudsman Commission and a decision had been taken by the DPP to prosecute him.</p>
      <p>She told the jurors that on 6 February, 2016, gardaí were on notice of a march or rally by an organisation called Pegida, which says it is against the islamicisation of countries and aims to protect national identity.</p>
      <p>A counter march had also been planned by organisations linked to the anti-racism network.</p>
      <p>Mr Lucey was part of a garda public order unit on duty in the city centre with the aim of preventing confrontations between the two groups.</p>
      <p>Mr Hand was working with a reporter for RTÉ, reporting on the events.</p>
      <p>Ms McGowan said that during the afternoon, the anti-racism protesters made a move to get down Cathedral Street in Dublin 1, to confront Pegida. Gardaí formed a line to stop any confrontation, the crowd got bigger and the situation grew tense.</p>
      <p>She said Mr Hand and the reporter, Colman O'Sullivan, made a certain decision as a result.  And she said there was an incident involving a camera and Mr Hand was then struck by a baton in the groin area. </p>
      <p>Mr Hand was able to continue filming for only a very short time after that she said.</p>
      <p>She told the jurors they would hear about the damage to the camera and the injuries to Mr Hand.</p>
      <p>Ms McGowan told the jurors she anticipated this was a case in which they would have to consider the circumstances in which a person was justified in using force.</p>
      <p>The case is expected to last up to five days.</p>
