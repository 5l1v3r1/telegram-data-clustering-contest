      <h1>Election 2019: BBC licence could be scrapped, Boris Johnson hints</h1>

      <p>Boris Johnson has hinted he may scrap the licence fee that funds the BBC during an unscripted question and answer session, while visiting the North East of England.</p>
      <p>Asked to scrap the licence fee as a whole, Johnson said he was “under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof” but admitted it was something he was looking at.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Sunderland, he added: “You have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach towards funding a TV, a media organisation, makes sense in the long term, given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves.”</p>
      <p>Going on to describe the licence fee as “a general tax”, Johnson said: “How long can you justify a system whereby everyone who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels?”</p>
      <p>This morning the Prime Minister raised questions over the expansion of Heathrow and the HS2 high speed rail link between London and Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Previously he inadvertently revealed a Tory government would raise the threshold for National Insurance contributions, a policy which was to be launched as part of the Conservatives manifesto, ahead of time.</p>
