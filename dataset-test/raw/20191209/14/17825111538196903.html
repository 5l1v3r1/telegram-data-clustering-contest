      <p>Beijing - People held in camps in China's Xinjiang region have now "graduated" and new trainees will have the freedom to come and go, the regional governor said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Governor Shohrat Zakir also hit out at Western criticism of the camps and said the United States had launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.</p>
      <p>China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps provide vocational training. It describes the detainees as students.</p>
      <p>"At present the trainees who have participated...have all graduated," Zakir told a news conference in Beijing. "With the help of the government, stable employment has been achieved and their quality of life has been improved."</p>
