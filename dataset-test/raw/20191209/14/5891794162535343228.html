      <p>ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Kazakh opposition activists have called on the authorities of the Central Asian nation to halt the deportation to China of two ethnic Kazakhs from China's northwestern region of Xinjiang.<br/><br/>Zhanbolat Mamai, Yrysbek Toqtasyn, and Tolegen Zhukeev told reporters in Almaty on December 9 that the two ethnic Kazakhs from China, Murager Alimuly and Qaster Musakhanuly, will "definitely" face torture and possible death if handed over to Beijing.<br/><br/>Last week, Darkhan Dilmanov, the deputy chief of Kazakhstan’s National Security Committee, said that the two ethnic Kazakhs from China will be deported.<br/><br/>The activists, who called themselves "initiators of a future Democratic Party of Kazakhstan," said that the country’s "duty is to protect rights of ethnic Kazakhs around the world."<br/><br/>Alimuly and Musakhanuly, who are currently in pretrial detention for illegally crossing the Chinese-Kazakh border, were granted asylum-seeker status in October.<br/><br/>Before their arrest, the two held a news conference in Almaty, where they told reporters that Alimuly was subjected to persecution in Xinjiang while Musakhanuly had spent several years in a so-called "reeducation camp" in the region.<br/><br/>In August last year, the United Nations said an estimated 1 million Uyghurs and members of other mostly Muslim indigenous ethnic groups in Xinjiang were being held in "counterextremism centers."<br/><br/>The UN said millions more had been forced into reeducation camps. China denies that the facilities are internment camps.<br/><br/>In August 2018, a <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-china-xinjiang/29528175.html">court in Almaty refused to extradite Sairagul Sauytbay</a></b>, an ethnic Kazakh Chinese citizen who was wanted in China for illegal border crossing.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-officials-testimony-chinese-reeducation-camps-muslims/29396709.html">Sauytbay fled China in April </a></b>and testified that thousands of ethnic Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and other Muslims in Xinjiang were undergoing "political indoctrination" at a network of "reeducation camps."<br/><br/>She added that Chinese authorities had forced her to train "political ideology" instructors for reeducation camps, giving her access to secret documents about what she called a state program to "reeducate" Muslims from indigenous ethnic communities.<br/><br/>Although she was not extradited to China, Kazakh authorities did not allow Sauytbay to stay in Kazakhstan and she eventually was granted asylum in Sweden.<br/><br/>Kazakhs are the second-largest Turkic-speaking indigenous community in Xinjiang after Uyghurs. The region is also home to ethnic Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Hui, also known as Dungans. Han, China's largest ethnicity, are the second-largest community in Xinjiang.</p>
