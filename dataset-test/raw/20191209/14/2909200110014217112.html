      <p>Former President John Dramani Mahama has marked the 2019 International Anti-corruption Day (which is today December 9, 2019) with an assurance that journalists will be safe thus none will be killed, live in fear or flee the country because of their investigative reporting on corruption.</p>
      <p>“We shall protect the rights of our people to expose corruption and undertake to investigate credible allegations that come to our attention.</p>
      <p>No journalist will be killed, live in fear or flee the country because of their investigative reporting,” a press statement to mark the day read in part.</p>
      <p>In the press statement signed on his behalf by his special aide, Joyce Mogtari, the former President Mahama further noted that the fight against corruption requires genuine and collective efforts, especially from political leadership, and the NDC has demonstrated that in the past when it governed and will continue the fight in future when it forms the government.</p>
      <p>“Fighting corruption requires genuine and collective efforts, particularly from political leaders. As we have demonstrated in the past, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) will make no excuses in this fight,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>The former President also lamented the recent surveys that show that the country is not making progress in the fight against corruption.</p>
      <p>“Sadly, recent surveys are confirming that we are losing the fight against corruption. This is a worry to majority of Ghanaians,” he pointed out.</p>
