      <p>The first trailer for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters--afterlife">Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a>, the latest entry in the series of supernatural comedies inspired by the hit 1984 comedy Ghostbusters, has been released online.</p>
      <p>Directed by Jason Reitman – the son of Ivan Reitman, director of the first two films – Ghostbusters: Afterlife is the result of long-gestating plans for a third film to follow 1989’s Ghostbusters II. Starring Carrie Coon from The Leftovers, Mckenna Grace and Finn Wolfhard, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/ghostbusters-afterlife-first-look">the film follows</a> a single mother and her two children as they move to Oklahoma after they inherit a mysterious property.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/bill-murray">Bill Murray</a>, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver – stars of the original film – are due to make cameo appearances; Harold Ramis, who played Egon Spengler, died in 2014.</p>
      <p>The 2016 reboot, featuring an all-female main cast, was <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ghostbusters-(2016)#tab=summary">a sizeable hit</a>, taking over $220m worldwide, but was notable for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jul/19/twitter-attacks-on-ghostbusters-leslie-jones">the racist and misogynist attacks</a> on one of its stars, Leslie Jones.</p>
