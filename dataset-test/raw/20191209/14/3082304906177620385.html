        <b>With Russia banned from major international sporting events – seemingly including the 2022 World Cup – FIFA has contacted WADA.</b>
      </p>
      <p>FIFA has made contact with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to clarify how Russia’s ban from major international sporting events applies to football.</p>
      <p>On Monday, WADA’s Executive Committee endorsed a recommended four-year ban for Russia, with the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) declared non-compliant again over inconsistencies in anti-doping data discovered during an investigation.</p>
      <p>The suspension means athletes will not be able to compete under the Russian flag at the 2020 Olympics or the 2022 Winter Games.</p>
      <p>It would also appear to prevent Russia from entering the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, although WADA’s International Standard for Code Compliance by Signatories does not list UEFA as a “major event organisation”, so Stanislav Cherchesov’s side will be free to compete at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>However, the Russian Football Union said it was hopeful football would not be impacted but it was waiting to hear from FIFA.</p>
      <p>FIFA is yet to reveal its stance on the suspension but has confirmed to Omnisport it is in contact with WADA and the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF).</p>
      <p>“FIFA has taken note of the decision taken by WADA Executive Committee today,” a FIFA spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>“FIFA is in contact with WADA and ASOIF to clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football.”</p>
      <p>RUSADA has 21 days to appeal the suspension, which would see its case referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Taylor, chair of the Compliance Review Committee that recommended the sanction, told a news conference: “It is the event that decides the world champion that is covered by the ban.”</p>
      <p>However, Taylor acknowledged each sport would be assessed on a “case-by-case basis”.</p>
      <p>“Let’s be clear about the totality of this package. It’s a four-year package and relates to a number of different things,” he said. “In terms of participation, the standard is clear.</p>
      <p>“There will be no flag at the events that are covered. There will not be a Russian flag and athletes will not be competing as representatives of Russia.</p>
      <p>“The details from sport to sport will have to differ because some are team sports, some are individual sports. There is going to have to be a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>“Nevertheless, what is important to note is that the standard says it is under the control and approval of WADA to ensure appropriate and standardised enforcement.</p>
      <p>“That may, if there is a CAS case, be taken to CAS so it can see and endorse it itself.</p>
      <p>“Can we be definitive now in every case as to what it will mean? No, but the standard is clear. They will not be there as representatives of Russia.”</p>
      <p>WADA president Craig Reedie said in a statement the body had delivered “a robust response”.</p>
      <p>“Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial,” he said.</p>
      <p>Other concerned parties, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), can also appeal to CAS if RUSADA chooses not to.</p>
      <p>An appeal from the IOC, another Olympic committee or an international federation – such as FIFA – would have to come within 21 days of RUSADA accepting WADA’s decision.</p>
