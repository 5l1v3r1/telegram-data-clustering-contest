      <h1>Game of Thrones brutally snubbed by Golden Globes in nominations shocker</h1>
      <h2>Hit HBO fantasy drama Game of Thrones has been snubbed by 77th Golden Globe Awards following controversial final season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:51:50+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The war for Westeros is over and so is the Golden Globes' love affair with the fantasy realm.</p>
      <p>Despite having been arguably the television event of the year, HBO fantasy drama <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> did not receive any <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/golden-globes-2020-nominations-include-21058225">major nominations</a> apart from a single acting nod.</p>
      <p>British actor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kit-harington">Kit Harington</a> was nominated for 'Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series – Drama' for his role as the heroic Jon Snow.</p>
      <p>He faces tough competition, however, from fellow British actors <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tobias-menzies">Tobias Menzies</a> as Prince Philip in The Crown and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brian-cox">Brian Cox</a> for Succession, Oscar winner <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rami-malek">Rami Malek</a> for Mr Robot, and Billy Porter for Pose.</p>
      <p>Porter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/emmy-awards-2019-winners-phoebe-20147561">took home the equivalent award</a> earlier this year at the 2019 Primetime Emmy Awards.</p>

      <p>The series lost out on the biggest award of the evening as 'Best Television Series – Drama' nominations were handed out instead to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/killing-eve">Killing Eve</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-crown">The Crown</a> , Big Little Lies, The Morning Show, and Succession.</p>
      <p>The Emmys awarded the equivalent award to the epic series mere months ago, but it seems love has worn off from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p>
      <p>Other acting heavyweights from the fantasy series such as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/peter-pinklage">Peter Dinklage</a> - who won an Emmy for his performance as Tyrion Lannister in the final season - and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lena-headey">Lena Headey</a> were also locked out of nominations for supporting turns in the show too.</p>
      <p>Could this be symptomatic of how divisive the final season was for many viewers and critics?</p>
      <p>Or is it just that the episodes aired quite some time ago now?</p>
