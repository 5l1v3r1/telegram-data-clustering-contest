        <b>You can't forget Natasha Singh who surfaced to speak in favour of her close friend Sidharth Shukla few days back on this very platform, here she is yet again to point out that Sidharth's game in Bigg Boss 13 isn't as good as it was- and why. Blame it on Shehnaaz and Paras, she says</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>So, what do you think of Sidharth Shukla's game strategy at the moment?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think he's going wrong. He was much better off when he was not Paras Chhabra's friend. He should not have broken up with Asim Riaz.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Asim was not just his confidante but he used to calm him down immediately, keeping his best interests in mind. Paras only provokes him. Shehnaaz Gill joins in to add ghee in the fire.</p>
      <p><b>Saw him yesterday and felt he has changed, too much attitude the way he was sitting and talking on the sofa...<br/></b>Well, he's like that but...</p>

      <p>
        <b>But what?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You are right. There is a certain change in him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which is swag becoming haughtiness?</b>
      </p>
      <p>People could interpret it like that. But as an audience and even as Sidharth's friend, I would say that this all is affecting his game adversely. He was a hero in the initial days of Bigg Boss 13.</p>
      <p><b>But now?<br/></b>Now, his temper has sadly got the better of him.</p>

      <p><b>But so what if Shehnaaz and Paras are instigating him? Aadmi ko khud ka bhi dimaag lagana chahiye na?<br/></b>Lagana chahiye no doubt, but this place, I mean the Bigg Boss House, is so... (trails off)</p>

      <p><b>Caustic?<br/></b>Volatile. It is difficult to control your emotions there. You can easily see that. </p>

      <p>
        <b>So basically, all said and done, Sidharth is in wrong company?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, and I think that he was better off in the phase when he and Mahira didn't get along. </p>
      <p><b>Comment on his romance with Shehnaaz Gill...<br/></b>I don't know how much of that is true.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Would his mom be in agreement with him on his newfound romance?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think his mom at least wouldn't mind it because she always wants him to be happy.</p>
      <p>I really want Sidharth to win Bigg Boss Season 13 and hence I am talking to you, so much.</p>
      <p><b>Parting shot?<br/></b>To tell you the truth, I was so happy when I saw him being put in the Secret Room yesterday. I felt he will get some 'Me' time and get his act together. But after a few moments, I saw Paras walking into the same room. Phew! God knows what Colors (broadcaster) is up to!  <br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/parasvchhabra/shehnaazgill/realsidharthshukla/colorstv/voot</i></p>
