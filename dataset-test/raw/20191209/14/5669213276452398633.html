      <p>Dec 3: KARKLOE, IMO 9518995, dwt 5400, English Channel S of Falmouth, NUC since early Dec 3, from Brunsbuettel to Nouadhibou, Mauritania, ETA Dec 12.<br/>Dec 5 Update: According to Lloyd, the ship suffered mechanical failure. Was taken on tow early Dec 5 by tug TSM KERMOR, under tow towards France, port of destination unknown.</p>
      <p>Dec 9 Update: The ship was towed to Saint-Brieuc Bay, France, English Channel, S of Jersey island, and anchored there on Dec 6, in order to wait out unfavourable weather. Understood she’s to be towed to Netherlands. KARKLOE is loaded with some 4000 tons of ammomium nitrate, posing a danger in case of major accident.<br/>Weather deteriorated during the night Dec 8-9, and reportedly, ship’s anchor dragged. Tug TSM KERMOR wasn’t powerful enough to stabilize KARKLOE position, SAR ship FS ARGONAUTE (IMO 9269518) was engaged. Judging from ships tracks, FS ARGONAUTE managed to control distressed freighter, preventing drift towards coast.</p>
