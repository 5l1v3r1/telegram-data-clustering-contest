      <p>You can probably count on one hand the number of times Tom Brady and the New England Patriots have been booed at Gillette Stadium. Surprisingly, it happened on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Brady and the Patriots were booed heading into halftime as they trailed the Kansas City Chiefs, 20-7, at home.</p>
      <p>New England ended up losing the game, 23-16. It was the first time Brady and Julian Edelman lost a home game against an AFC opponent. They were 42-0 heading into the game.</p>
      <p>Brady had a simple reaction to the booing following the contest.</p>
      <p>“You hear cheers, you hear boos, that’s part of being in sports,” Brady said.</p>

      <p>Brady was also asked what he wanted to do following the booing at halftime.</p>
      <p>“Try to go in and play better,” he responded.</p>
      <p>New England dropped to 10-3 following the loss to Kansas City. The Patriots are still in great position for the postseason, but they now trail Baltimore in the race for home-field advantage by two games.</p>
