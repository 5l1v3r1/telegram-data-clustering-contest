      <h1>Chris Cornell’s Widow Is Suing Soundgarden</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:30:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nick DeRiso</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/chris-cornell/">Chris Cornell</a>'s widow has sued his former band, claiming <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/soundgarden/">Soundgarden</a> is withholding thousands in royalties owed to their late frontman's family. The dispute apparently traces back to seven unreleased songs, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/09/chris-cornell-widow-vicky-sues-soundgarden-unpaid-royalties-strong-arm/">TMZ</a>.</p>
      <p>The legal documents reportedly describe an "unlawful attempt to strong-arm Chris' Estate into turning over certain audio recordings created by Chris before he passed away." Vicky Cornell says the songs, which appear to be among her late husband's final recordings, were "solely authored by Chris; contain Chris' own vocal tracks; and were bequeathed to Chris' Estate" for the benefit of his family.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that Vicky Cornell offered to release the tracks with Soundgarden, but added certain stipulations put in place by Chris – including which producer to use. They refused, she claims.</p>
      <p>Soundgarden reportedly countered with a letter to Vicky Cornell saying they were "working on the files in a collaborative effort." Before Cornell's <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/chris-cornell-dead/">sudden death</a>, they say "the entire band was feeling very positive about their rekindled artistic energy and creativity." The letter apparently lists members of Soundgarden as co-writers with Chris on five of the seven disputed songs, according to TMZ.</p>
      <p>Cornell's widow also says Kim Thayil falsely claimed that she has kept Soundgarden from releasing another album, TMZ says. She reportedly accuses the guitarist of intentionally misleading the band's "loyal, rabid fan base."</p>
      <p>Her lawsuit was filed by attorneys Marty Singer and James Sammataro.<br/> <br/> </p>
      <h3>Soundgarden Albums Ranked</h3>

      <h4>6. 'King Animal' (2012)</h4>
      <p>After a 16-year absence, Soundgarden reunited for an album that pretty much picks up where they left off in the mid '90s. If their brand of power grunge sounds a bit out of place in the new millennium, at least they pile on the force of the era. The only thing missing is a memorable song or two.</p>

      <h4>5. 'Ultramega OK' (1988)</h4>
      <p>The band's debut album is certainly rocky at times, with everyone testing out their Black Sabbath-Led Zeppelin crunch in new settings. At best, 'Ultramega OK' hints at what's to come: Chris Cornell's howling vocals., Kim Thayil's bulldozing guitar. But the thin production can't keep up with the rock-slide sound, and most of the songs reveal a band still in its infancy.</p>

      <h4>4. 'Down on the Upside' (1996)</h4>
      <p>Following up an alt-rock milestone like 'Superunknown' wasn't an easy task, as Soundgarden found out. So they just opted to repeat themselves instead of trying to top their masterpiece. When it's good, 'Down on the Upside' sounds like 'Superunknown Part 2.' But it goes on too long, and the new things they try – less heavy, more experimental – are hit and miss. Not bad at all, but they sound tired, which might explain why they broke up the following year.</p>

      <h4>3. 'Louder Than Love' (1989)</h4>
      <p>With their second album, Soundgarden inched closer to the band that helped define hard rock, alternative music and grunge in the next decade. They still had a few kinks to work out, but their nods to the past (Sabbath and Zeppelin are the big ones) are dosed with an eye toward the future. In an era where heavy music was pretty much shoved underground by lipstick-wearing clowns, 'Louder Than Love' was a giant middle finger that doubled as a warning.</p>

      <h4>2. 'Badmotorfinger' (1991)</h4>
      <p>Soundgarden's breakthrough LP was released just weeks after Nirvana's 'Nevermind' turned rock 'n' roll in an entirely different direction. 'Badmotorfinger' wasn't a massive hit, but it helped set the stage for what was to come over the next few years: awesomely electric guitars, bottom-of-the-gut singing and a turbo-charged blender of rock 'n' roll that grabbed as liberally from the past as it pulled closer to the future. Rock 'n' roll rarely got this heavy in the early '90s. 'Badmotorfinger' is the sound of a movement being born.</p>

      <h4>1. 'Superunknown' (1994)</h4>
      <p>The moment where it all comes together for Soundgarden. A banner year for alternative and grunge music helped propel the band to the top of the heap, and on 'Superunknown' they deliver a set that's every bit as odd and experimental as it is in-your-face and powerful. The best parts of 'Badmotorfinger' – the straight-up rock 'n' roll drive – merge with a Beatlesque sense of wonder at times, giving the album its own place among '90s classics. Soundgarden were never better.</p>
