      <p>Aje-Afunwa said that the sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and should be gainfully employed.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kolawole, who resides at Agege area of Lagos, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretences and stealing.</p>
      <p>The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
      <p>The Prosecutor, ASP Peter Nwaongwu, told the court that the defendant and others still at large, committed the offences on July 8, at Fidelity Bank, Agege Branch.</p>
      <p>Nwaongwu alleged that the defendant and his accomplices conspired among themselves to obtain N8 million under false pretences from Mrs Chibuike Obi to sell a building to her.</p>
      <p>He said that the building which is situated at No 8, Christ Foundation St., Ilupeju, Oke Aro, belonged to the defendant.</p>
      <p>According to him, the offences contravened Sections 287, 314 (3) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2015.</p>
      <p>Aje-Afunwa adjourned the case till Jan. 9, 2020 for hearing.</p>
