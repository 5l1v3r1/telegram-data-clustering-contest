      <h1>Paddy McGuinness stuck in a rut in BTS look at Top Gear Christmas special</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:14:58+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Deen</a></address>
      <p>Top Gear presenter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/paddy-mcguinness/">Paddy McGuinness</a> got stuck in a rut during filming of the Christmas special.</p>
      <p>In a special episode to air later this month, Paddy and co-hosts Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris will head all the way to Nepal.</p>
      <p>In one of their toughest road trips ever the boys will take a voyage from Nepal’s capital Kathmandu, to the Forbidden City of Lo Manthang, a secretive kingdom on the Tibetan plateau on the far side of the Himalayas.</p>
      <p>To make thing that little bit trickier for them, they are swapping 4x4s for a very small Peugeot, an even smaller Renault and the only locally-built car in Nepal.</p>
      <p>All three motors look like they’re going to cause them some trouble along the way.</p>
      <p>In pictures taken during filming for the special episode, Paddy looks like he’s had enough as he sits in the front of their red car, which seems to have ground to a halt in a muddy ditch. Meanwhile Chris tries to give him some words of encouragement from the outside.</p>
      <p>Or maybe he’s just telling Paddy to shift himself because their other vehicle is stuck behind him.</p>

      <p>Top Gear will return for a full series in 2020 with a date yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>The renewal came after the latest presenting line-up turned out to be a hit when they made their debut back in the summer.</p>
      <p>Just like presenter Richard Hammond before him, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/12/top-gears-freddie-flintoff-fighting-fit-hits-gym-high-speed-crash-10728624/">Freddie was involved in a high speed crash back in September while filming scenes for the show.</a></p>
      <p>The cricketer had been racing at Elvington Airfield, near York, and veered off the track at high speed. But thankfully he managed to come out basically unscathed with his helmet and full racing suit doing their job.</p>
      <p>Freddie insisted he was absolutely fine following the incident, but admitted he might have taken things a bit too far.</p>

      <p>He told Mail Online: ‘I’m absolutely fine and was back filming today. I go to great lengths to make sure I do well in Top Gear drag races but on this occasion I went a few lengths too far.</p>
      <p>‘It will look more ridiculous than dangerous when you see it on TV.’</p>
      <p>A BBC spokesperson added that Freddie ‘suffered no injuries as a result of his spontaneous detour, as fans will see for themselves when we show the sequence in full in the next series’.</p>
      <p>Freddie may have had a lucky escape, as the course was the same one that Richard crashed on in 2006, ending up in a coma for two weeks.</p>
