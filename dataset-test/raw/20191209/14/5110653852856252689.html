      <p>The current free-agent class is still headlined by Gerrit Cole, Anthony Rendon and Stephen Strasburg. While the latter two could sign sooner rather than later, Cole might not choose to sign until January or later, according to his agent.</p>
      <p>The next tier of free agents features Zack Wheeler and Madison Bumgarner. Wheeler, 29, and Bumgarner, 30, are both legitimate top-of-the-rotationpitchers when healthy.</p>
