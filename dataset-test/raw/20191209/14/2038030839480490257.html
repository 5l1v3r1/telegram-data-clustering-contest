      <p>Cape Town - Princess Beatrice has reportedly cancelled her engagement party in light of the scandal surrounding her dad, Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>The celebration that was set to be held on 18 December was reportedly cancelled because the couple feared that paparazzi would swamp the Duke of York, who’s been <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/watch-prince-andrew-denies-sexual-allegations-in-explosive-interview-20191118"><b>accused of sexually assaulting a woman</b></a> who was 17 years old at the time.</p>
      <p>"Bea has had to change the date of her engagement party at the Chiltern Firehouse because of fears there will be too many photographers outside – looking for him," <b><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7767935/TALK-TOWN-Princess-Beatrice-cancels-engagement-party.html">Daily Mail</a> </b>said.</p>
      <p>"The venue choice caused alarm among pals concerned it was far too high-profile given the sensitive time her family is going through."</p>
      <p>Princess Beatrice and her fiancé, businessman Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, will reportedly be holding an intimate gathering at a close friend's apartment, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-beatrice-cancels-engagement-party-prince-andrew-scandal-report"><b>Fox News</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>The news comes shortly after Prince Andrew (59) announced that he’ll be <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/prince-andrew-will-step-back-from-public-duties-amid-ongoing-sexual-misconduct-scandal-20191120"><b>stepping down from his public duties</b></a>, following a controversial interview with the BBC.</p>
      <p>"It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support," he said in the statement.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission."</p>
