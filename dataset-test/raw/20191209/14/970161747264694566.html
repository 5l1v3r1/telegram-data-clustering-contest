      <p>A stripper has been convicted of beheading her boyfriend’s disabled Star Wars-obsessed son after having sex with him.</p>
      <p>Roena Cheryl Mills, 43, was last Thursday found guilty of the first-degree murder of 29 year-old Bo White at a house in Lerona, West Virginia, in April 2018.</p>
      <p>Mills – who has the phrase ‘special kinda crazy’ tattooed across her chest – reportedly targeted Bo after having sex with him in return for drugs.</p>
      <p>She is said to have battered and stabbed him to death before chopping his body up.</p>
      <p>Jurors recommended that Mills serve life ‘without mercy’ – a West Virginian legal term which means prisoners must never be given parole.</p>

      <p>The exotic dancer had also been enjoying a relationship with Bo’s dad James, who met her while she worked at a strip club called Southern X-Posure, where some dancers traded sexual favors for drugs.</p>
      <p>Bo was described by prosecutor George Silter as being a ‘an awkward, sickly shut-in who didn’t have a real life’, lived off a disability allowance, and loved playing with Star Wars figures.</p>
      <p>Silter added: ‘His father had introduced him to a manipulative woman.</p>
      <p>‘She knew Bo had a pocket full of pills and a pocket full of cash.’</p>
      <p>Mills reportedly began dismembering Bo’s corpse with a regular knife, only to find ‘all that flesh and bone is hard to cut with a good knife.’</p>

      <p>She then went to ask a neighbor for a chainsaw in an apparent bid to speed up the disposal of Bo’s body, only to have her request refused.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, sheriff’s deputies found Mills in a wooded area next to Bo’s head. Her victim’s body was lying inside his home.</p>
      <p>She was arrested and taken to jail, only to then tell deputies ‘You have to let me go back to my heads.’</p>
      <p>Mills’ attorney Sid Bell defended the killer by trying to allege that James Mills’ was involved in his son’s death.</p>
      <p>He has not faced any criminal charges, the <a href="https://www.bdtonline.com/news/guilty-jury-convicts-mills-in-decapitation-case/article_7e439f14-178c-11ea-82c6-178135e23769.html">Bluefield Daily Telegraph</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Bell claimed the blows which killed Bo required ‘a lot of strength’ to inflict.</p>
      <p>James White reportedly found his son’s body before sheriff’s deputies did, but believed a prank was being played on him, as he was high at the time.</p>
