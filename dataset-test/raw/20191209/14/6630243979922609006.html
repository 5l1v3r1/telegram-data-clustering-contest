      <p>Guinea Bissau’s outgoing President José Mario Vaz has announced his support for Umaro Sissoco Embalo in the second round of the presidential elections on 29 December.</p>
      <p>Embalo, himself a former Prime Minister, comes up against another former Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira.</p>
      <p>Elected in 2014, Jose Mario Vaz failed in his bid to get re-elected coming fourth in the first round with 12.4 % of votes cast.</p>
      <p>Sissoco Embalo came in second in the first round on 24 November, with 27.6% of votes against 40.1% for Pereira, candidate of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde.</p>
      <p>Umaro Sissoco Embalo has already obtained the support of two other presidential candidates namely Nuno Gomes Nabiam and former Prime Minister, Carlos Domingos Gomes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 56 year old Domingos Simoes Pereira, will rely on the support of two unsuccessful candidates in the first round Yaya Djalo and Idrissa Djalo.</p>
      <p>The campaign for the second round is scheduled to start on December 13 and end on December 27.</p>
