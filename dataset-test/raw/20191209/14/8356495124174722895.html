      <p>More than a billion dollars has wiped off the value of New Zealand's biggest company this morning following the surprise resignation of A2 Milk's chief executive.</p>
      <p>In a market announcement, Jayne Hrdlicka said she had not anticipated the amount of travel involved when she took up the role 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>Jayne Hrdlicka would be replaced by the former chief executive Geoff Babidge, while the company began a global search for her replacement.</p>
      <p>The company, which is dual listed in New Zealand and Australia, opened sharply lower at the open this morning, wiping more than a billion dollars off its market value.</p>
      <p>The shares were trading about $14.30 in the first 15 minutes of trading, from $15.17 on Friday, with a market value of $10.52 billion, compared with $11.63b on Friday.</p>
      <p>The resignation follows the recent release of the company's growth strategy, which had been positively received by the market.</p>
      <p>"The reality however is that the next 3-5 years will continue to require the CEO being present in our core markets of China and the US and that combined with running a New Zealand company based in Australia required more travel than I had anticipated when I joined the company," Hrdlicka said.</p>
      <p>"The Board and I agreed that this next phase is going to be too difficult to manage alongside my other commitments whilst also managing the health and wellness priorities of my family and me."</p>
      <p>She said she would work with Babidge and the board to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
