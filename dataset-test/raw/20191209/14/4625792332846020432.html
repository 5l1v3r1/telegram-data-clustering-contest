      <h1>Nadler: Trump put himself before country</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:41:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author">Susan Ferrechio</a></address>
      <p>House Judiciary Committee Democrats argued President Trump put himself ahead of the interests of the country by seeking Ukraine’s help investigating Joe Biden and the Democrats.</p>
      <p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York said the evidence Democrats obtained demonstrates Trump is trying to undermine the 2020 election for his own benefit and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/mad-dash-to-impeach-trump-by-christmas">demands a speedy impeachment process</a>.</p>
      <p>“The integrity of our next election is at stake,” Nadler said. “Nothing could be more urgent. The president welcomed election interference in 2016 and he demanded it in 2020. Then he got caught.”</p>
      <p>Nadler’s statement opened a hearing meant to evaluate evidence presented by the House Intelligence Committee, which conducted weeks of depositions and hearings on the president’s effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and the Democrats.</p>
      <p>It all stemmed from a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">July 25 call</a> between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Nadler said.</p>
      <p>“That call was a part of a concerted effort by President Trump to compel the government of Ukraine to announce an investigation,” Nadler said. “Not an investigation of corruption at large but an investigation of President Trump’s political rivals, and only his political rivals. President Trump put himself before the country.”</p>
      <p>Nadler opened the hearing to a shouting protester who was removed by police.</p>
      <p>Democrats are expected to vote on articles of impeachment this week, although the vote has not been scheduled yet.</p>
