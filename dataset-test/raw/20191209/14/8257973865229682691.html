      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- No. 1 Stanford won the 2019 women's College Cup soccer title by beating No. 2 North Carolina in a penalty kick session.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal beat the Tar Heels 5-4 in penalty kicks after a scoreless regulation Sunday at Avaya Stadium in San Jose, Calif. Stanford freshman goalie Katie Meyer saved two shots during the penalty kick period.</p>
      <p>Kiara Pickett netted the winning goal, firing a shot into the left side of the net. Stanford now has three women's soccer titles. North Carolina has appeared in 26 national title games and has a record 21 wins.</p>
      <p>"We all had butterflies, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/08/college-cup-stanford-extended-to-a-shootout-before-winning-title/">especially for me knowing</a> that I had to score in order for us to win," Pickett told the Bay Area News Group. "We're literally a family so we do it for each other."</p>

      <p>Claudia Dickey made a career-high six saves for North Carolina.</p>
      <p>"We <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/article238183439.html">called it 'redemption year' all year</a> and that's why it hurts more," Dickey told the Raleigh News &amp; Observer. "But we challenged one of the best teams."</p>
