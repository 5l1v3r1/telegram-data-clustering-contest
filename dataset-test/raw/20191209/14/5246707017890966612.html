      <p>Next year, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bite_the_bullet"><b>Bite the Bullet</b></a> is set to combine two of our favourite things: RPGs and food. Before it does arrive on Switch, though, the developers have shared an early look at the weapons you can expect to get your hands on in-game.</p>
      <p>You see, the game features rogue-lite RPG elements which are centred around shooting, eating, and crafting. You'll need to gun down your adversaries before dining on their corpses to craft new weapons, energise skills and special attacks, and transform into a powerful Zombro form to smash foes into smithereens.</p>
      <p>The trailer above gives you an in-depth look at the different types of weapons in the game, as well as their capabilities. A particular favourite of ours is the Critter Cannon that lets you fire cute animals at will.</p>
      <blockquote><b>Key Features Include:<br/>-</b> <b>Chow Down on Everything –</b> Devour enemies, walls and even bullets to powerup your character, weapons and abilities.<br/><i>-</i> <b>Food Based Class System</b> – Choose between diet-based classes like the vegetarian Slaughter of the Soil or the blood-soaked Gorivore, all based on what you eat. Chew carefully because every enemy has its own nutritional information, and your body type will change based on the types of enemies you consume.<br/><i>-</i> <b>Loot Powerful Weapons –</b> Defeat enemies and take their mighty weapons with fun modifiers, like Spicy Critter Cannons and Organic Meat-Seeking Missiles.<br/><i>-</i><b>Customize Your Character &amp; Weapons –</b> Wolf down special types of characters and enemies to craft exotic new weapons and customize your character’s synergistic skill tree that offer abilities like Napalm Vomit and Appetite for Destruction.<br/><i>-</i> <b>Transform into Powerful Zombro Form –</b> Spice up combat to the next level by mutating into Zombro form and smashing enemies into bite-sized bits.</blockquote>
