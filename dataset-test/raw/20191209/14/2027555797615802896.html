      <h1>BJP will not indulge in Operation Kamala, says Kateel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:53:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/ajith-athrady" target="_blank">Ajith Athrady</a></address>
      <p>The BJP will not indulge in Operation Kamala, but Opposition parties MLAs are welcome to join the party, state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The BJP never involved in "Operation Kamala" earlier. Even in the future also we will not encourage such activities. However, if any Opposition political parties leaders including MLAs wanted to join BJP, we will welcome them, “ Kateel said told reporters here.</p>
      <p>"Since the BJP has crossed the majority mark, there is no need to seek any body help for the stability of the government. However, we wanted to strengthen our party's base across the state," he said. </p>
      <p>He also said due to the united fight put out by the BJP has resulted in winning 12 seats in bypoll, he said.</p>
      <p>Terming elections results is a victory to the developmental works implemented by the Centre and Yediyurappa-led government in the state, he said the party will focus more on strengthening the organisation in southern Karnataka in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Separately, Union Fertilizer Minister D V Sadananda Gowda said that the elections results are befitting reply to Congress leaders who have been talking against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, in foul language. </p>
      <p>"Congress leaders particularly, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah should talk very carefully in public forum," Gowda said. </p>
