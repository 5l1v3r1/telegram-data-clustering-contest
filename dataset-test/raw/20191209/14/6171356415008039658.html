      <h1>New Google Assistant on Pixel 4 will soon support English in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and the UK</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:58:30+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/rita/" target="_blank">Rita El Khoury</a></address>
      <p>Google's Assistant newest iteration, which launched with the Pixel 4, has a <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/09/6-things-to-try-with-the-new-google-assistant-on-your-pixel-4/">few tricks up its sleeve</a>, but accessing it has been restricted by some draconian requirements. You need to have a Pixel 4 <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/17/new-google-assistant-gesture-navigation-only/">with gesture navigation</a>, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/18/googles-making-it-stupidly-difficult-to-access-the-new-assistant-if-you-use-a-g-suite-account/">no G Suite account</a> on the same user profile, and everything has to be set to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/16/new-google-assistant-features-on-pixel-4-exclusive-to-us-at-launch-only-speaks-english/">US English</a>. That last limitation will soon be lifted with five new English variants joining in.</p>
      <p>As was previously expected, Google is starting to relax the language requirement around the new Assistant. The company says that the digital helper will "soon" be available on the Pixel 4 in these five English variants: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and UK. These come in addition to US English.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that you don't need to live in one of these countries to activate the new Assistant; you just need your phone and Assistant language to be set to a supported language.</p>
