      <p>After Goswami was elected the president of the NBF he called the news body a “game-changer” which will change the dynamics of Indian broadcasting.</p>
      <p>“For far too long a clutch of Delhi-based channels have falsely claimed to represent Indian broadcasting. NBF will change that, for good”, Goswami was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>Besides Goswami, members of the NBF also elected four vice-presidents namely - Jagi Mangat Panda of Ortel Communications, Shankar Bala of Fourth Dimension Media, Prag News’ Sanjive Narain, and ITV Network’s Kartikeya Sharma.</p>
