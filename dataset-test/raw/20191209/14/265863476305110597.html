      <p>Reginae Carter proudly announced her fans and followers that she’s featured in a movie called ‘Dear Santa, I Need A Date.’ She told people that they could catch the film all month.</p>
      <p>You can also check out the trailer that she shared on her IG account below.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you, everyone who tuned in ❤️ if you missed it , you can catch it all December on @tvonetv 😘 #dearsantaineedadate,’ Reginae captioned her post.</p>
      <p>People were surprised that she’s in a movie, and a lot of followers asked Nae why she did not tell them that she’d be featured in the comedy.</p>
      <p>Someone commented: ‘Ummmmm why didn’t you say you were going to be in a movie.’</p>

      <p>A follower gushed over Nae’s acting talent and said: ‘Great job you’re a natural at this acting thing!’ while another follower praised Nae and well and posted this: ‘@colormenae great job it was good really enjoy it.’</p>
      <p>Other than this, Reginae has been living her best life in Dubai during the past week.</p>
      <p>She was there with her mom, Toya Wright, Robert Rushing, her BFF Zonnique Pullins, and more important people.</p>
      <p>She made sure to keep her fans and followers updated, so Nae flooded her social media account with all kinds of pics and videos from Dubai.</p>
      <p>Nae also made sure to post some new pics in which <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/reginae-carter-shows-off-her-snatched-body-in-dubai-and-worries-fans-for-this-reason-348139/">she’s showing off her beach body</a>, and she looked totally snatched.</p>
      <p>Fans were only worried because Nae was posing without too many clothes on, and this is not something great to do in Dubai.</p>
