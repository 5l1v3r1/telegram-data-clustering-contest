      <h1>Nick Cannon Hints At His Black Squad Wanting To Battle Eminem</h1>

      <p>Is the world about to see Wild 'N Out versus Shady Records?</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>It appears Nick Cannon is ready to go to lyrical war with Eminem. The two stars' longstanding feud reignited last week when<a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/eminem-raps-nut-job-mariah-carey-had-nick-cannon-whipped---ePZqa-MUO19vr9k8FxmQ/"> Em responded to Cannon's comments fromÂ T.I.'s <i>ExpediTIously</i> podcast</a> in September.</p>
      <p>Cannon recalled on the show, "I said, 'I know I'm not gonna be able to out rap you, but I will whoop your ass.'" Eminem answered back on Fat Joe'sÂ "Lord Above" track with the lines, "Almost got my caboose kicked? Fool, quit. You not gonna do sh*t. I let her chop my balls off too 'fore I lost to you, Nick."</p>
      <p>This whole ordeal goes back to Em's decade-old issues with Nick Cannon's ex-wife Mariah Carey. The iconic vocalist even released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Yt0xJKDY8">Eminem diss song in 2009 titled "Obsessed."</a> Now Cannon seems to be open to battling his Detroit-based rival in some capacity.</p>
      <p>Over the last several days, the Power 106 radio host has taken aim at Em on Instagram. Cannon's most recent IG post is a photo of the actor/comedian along with <i>Wild 'N Out</i> cast members/professional battle rappers Conceited and Hitman Holla. He wrote in the caption, "Welp... Yâ€™all asked for it!!! ðŸ¤£#TheInvitation #BlackSquad."</p>
      <p>Conceited, Hitman Holla, and fellow battler Charlie Clips implied they were open to teaming with Cannon against the Shady Records founder. All three Smack/URL legends commented under their boss' Instagram pic which led to other users wondering if Eminem would actually make an appearance on the long-running improv comedy seriesÂ <i>Wild 'N Out.</i></p>
