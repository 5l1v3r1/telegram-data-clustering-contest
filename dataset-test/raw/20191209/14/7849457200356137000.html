      <p>MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim said that there was no better time than now to see how the Pasig River can alleviate the ongoing traffic woes currently being experienced by commuters.</p>
      <p>The PRFS will be offering free rides for the month of December. Commuters will be accommodated on a first come, first served basis and is operational from 6 a.m. up to 6 p.m. during weekdays.</p>
      <p>Lim said that the free transportation service hopes to encourage the public to patronize the ferry service over public utility vehicles and avoid the hassles of commuting in congested Metro Manila roads.</p>
      <p>He thanked the local chief executives of Metro Manila for their support for the project, especially Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto who provided two new ferry boats that are now part of the service.</p>
      <p>The PRFS currently has seven boats with varying carrying capacities Two of the boats can ferry up to 57 passengers, three boats with 36 passengers, and two with 16 passengers.</p>
      <p>The ferry service runs from Pinagbuhatan in Pasig City to Escolta in Manila, with 11 stations. Stations in Pasig City are Pinagbuhatan, San Joaquin and Maybunga. Makati City has stations in Guadalupe and Valenzuela. Mandaluyong has one station in Hulo. Stations in Manila are Sta. Ana, PUP, Lawton, and Escolta.</p>
      <p>Stations are fully-equipped with comfortable seats, convenient restrooms, free internet connectivity, for passengers waiting for rides.</p>
      <p>“Expect better services with additional safe and speedy boats, rehabilitated ferry stations and additional personnel,” Lim said.</p>
      <p>The agency revealed that there was also a plan to further expand the services of the PRFS by constructing more stations in Quinta Market in Manila, Circuit Makati in Makati, and Kalawaan in Pasig.</p>
