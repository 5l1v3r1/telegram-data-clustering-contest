      <h1>Hucknall Fire Station closes after 75 years as firefighters move to new base</h1>
      <h2>Members of the public were concerned they were losing their fire station when the Watnall Road station closed</h2>

      <p>Hucknall Fire Station has closed its door after 75 years in the town and moved to a new 'super hub' where it will share its facilities with police and the ambulance service.</p>
      <p>The centre at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">East Midlands Ambulance</a> station in Annesley Road will have police officers, firefighters and paramedics working all under one roof as part of cost-cutting measures.</p>
      <p>East Midlands Ambulance Service said this is the first 'tri-service station' to be created in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Nottinghamshire</a> .</p>
      <p>The former Hucknall Fire Station in Watnall Road first opened in 1944 to support RAF Hucknall.</p>
      <p>Crews have collected handfuls of memorabilia over the years, all of which have been moved to the new site.</p>
      <p>Craig Day, district manager for Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: "Whilst the old station holds many fond memories, we are looking forward to an exciting new chapter for Hucknall Fire Station.</p>

      <p>"Moving to a new site is a fantastic investment in the on-call team based at Hucknall and fully embraces collaborative working with our blue-light partners.</p>
      <p>"The new location provides a great opportunity for those who live or work near to the station to come and join as on-call firefighters, to serve the communities of Nottinghamshire."</p>
      <p>Building work began back in early May this year at the existing EMAS site, to construct two major extensions, in order to create more room for the fire service fleet.</p>

      <p>Assistant Chief Officer Ian Pritchard said: "Planning for this move has been going on behind the scenes for nearly three years.</p>
      <p>"It’s often overlooked when these projects are delivered, the amount of time and effort involved to get to where we are today.</p>
      <p>"Many of our staff have been involved in this project, they’ve been working hard for a long time to get everything ready for our crews to move in.</p>
      <p>"I would like to say thank you to all of those involved from the Hucknall on-call crew, the estates team and the support staff who have all helped to bring this joint-collaboration to life, creating the first blue-light tri-service hub of its kind in Nottinghamshire."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Ashfield Independent</a> Councillor Jim Blagden, who represents Hucknall Central, said residents were concerned when the station closed.</p>
      <p>"People are thinking it is another thing we have lost from Hucknall," he said. "But we have not. It has just relocated. I do not think the publicity was put out.</p>
      <p>"I am up for progress. It's new location has easy access to the motorway and to the town. Hucknall Road is getting so congested with all the house building."</p>
