      <h1>Plymouth Lib Dem candidate denies he is pulling out of General Election</h1>
      <h2>Graham Reed says his name will definitely be on the ballot paper in Plymouth Sutton and Devonport on Thursday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:52:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author">Rom Preston-Ellis</a></address>
      <p>The Liberal Democrat candidate for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport has denied rumours that he is no longer standing at the General Election.</p>
      <p>Rumours have been circulating that the Lib Dems would be pulling out of the marginal seat currently held by Labour candidate Luke Pollard to avoid splitting the vote following a tweet from former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell.</p>
      <p>But candidate Graham Reed confirmed to Plymouth Live that he would be on the ballot paper on Thursday despite encouraging voters to vote tactically to avoid a 'Tory Brexit'.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats have not been canvassing in Sutton and Devonport, instead putting their efforts behind Totnes candidate and former Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston.</p>
      <p>"The rumours are false, I'm not standing down," said Mr Reed, who previously stood for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport in 2015 and for Moor View in 2017.</p>
      <p>"The reality is that I can't stand down even if I wanted to.</p>

      <p>"The party would probably kick me out and I would lose my £500 deposit.</p>
      <p>"In my view, every person in the constituency should have the option to vote for every main party.</p>
      <p>"But I am firmly in favour of tactical voting in order to stop the Conservatives and Brexit."</p>
      <p>Mr Reed, who is a former city councillor, added: "I was asked to stand by the Liberal Democrats and have been doing hustings ever since.</p>
      <p>"We haven't been canvassing in Sutton and Devonport because we simply don't have the resources but I will be on the ballot paper.</p>

      <p>"I think Alastair Campbell got a bit carried away and confused us not canvassing with not standing.</p>
      <p>"But I do want to break the Tory stronghold in the South West and people should vote tactically to do that.</p>
      <p>"I have voted tactically in the past and I will leave it up to voters to decide whether they want to do the same."</p>
      <p>Despite the Lib Dems and Green Party remaining on the ballot paper for Thursday's General Election, Mr Pollard called upon cross-party support to "stop Boris Johnson" when contacted by Plymouth Live.</p>
      <p>"It is a really close race between Labour and the Conservatives in Plymouth and there’s a lot at stake," he said.</p>
      <p>"We know people are voting tactically to protect our NHS from privatisation.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been proud to stand up for everyone in Plymouth regardless of their party allegiance over the past two years and that cross-party effort to get us our fair share is being recognised especially by Green and Lib Dem voters.</p>
      <p>"It’s a two-horse race here and if people want to stop Boris Johnson they need to vote Labour."</p>
      <p>James Ellwood, Green Party candidate for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport said: "I can’t see why they’d stand down at this stage and it certainly hasn’t been discussed within the greens locally.</p>
      <p>"Labour were approached to work together as part of progressive alliance and they refused, leaving us with no option but to stand in all seats not part of that electoral pact."</p>
