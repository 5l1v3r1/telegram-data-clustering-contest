      <h1>‘I hope it’s not a live volcano': Americans caught in deadly New Zealand eruption</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:22:36+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>An unexpected volcanic <u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/08/white-island-whakaari-eruption-new-zealand-jacinda-ardern/">eruption</a></u> in New Zealand has trapped dozens of tourists, including several Americans.</p>
      <p>White Island, which touts itself as “New Zealand’s most active volcano,” erupted without warning on Sunday, killing five and leaving dozens trapped. Authorities reported that around 50 people were known to be on the island volcano when it erupted, but only 23 have been rescued.</p>
      <p>Authorities in New Zealand do not expect the remaining missing people to be found alive, as ash continues to hang in the air on the island.</p>
      <p>“No signs of life have been seen at any point,” according to a <a href="https://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/update-eruption-white-island-%E2%80%93-recovery-operation">statement</a> from authorities. “Police believe that anyone who could have been taken from the island alive was rescued at the time of the evacuation. Based on the information we have, we do not believe there are any survivors on the island.”</p>
      <p>Among those who were rescued was an American couple on their honeymoon. Matthew and Lauren Urey were aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship that offered White Island as one of the stops. The newlyweds were on the volcano when it shot off hot ash 12,000 feet into the air.</p>

      <p>Both were rushed to a hospital after receiving severe burns, but their families have not been updated about their conditions. They were notified that the Ureys were missing after being contacted by the cruise line.</p>
      <p>The two had called Lauren’s mother, Barbara Barham, prior to getting on the volcano. “She said they were going to the volcano,” Barham told the <i>Washington Post</i>. “My husband was joking around and said, ‘I hope it’s not a live volcano.’”</p>
      <p>Matthew, 36, and Lauren, 32, told her mother they "weren’t concerned that there was any chance of an eruption.”</p>
      <p>After the eruption, Matthew Urey was able to get a call out to his family, who relayed the message to Barham.</p>
      <p>“Her son called and said that they had been on the excursion and there had been a volcano eruption and they were burned very bad,” Barham explained. “He said he would try to call as soon as he could, but talking and making phone calls was difficult. His hands were so badly burned it was hard for him to make a phone call.”</p>
      <p>The Barhams haven’t heard from the couple since Urey’s phone call and have been “panicking” ever since.</p>
      <p>“I’m just livid,” Barham said. “There’s been warnings about it … My son-in-law never would have booked the excursion if he knew there was any chance of them being injured.”</p>
      <p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern issued her condolences to those impacted by the volcano, saying, “I know there will be a huge amount of concern and anxiety for those who have loved ones on or around the island at the time, and I can assure them police are doing everything they can.”</p>
      <p>She added that she hasn’t decided if visitors will be allowed on the volcano in the future, “There will be a time and a place to undertake further assessments. Now, we have to focus on allowing the police to do their job and focus on those who were in the vicinity of the island at the time.”</p>
      <p>White Island is <u><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50710998">privately owned</a></u> and not inhabited by anyone, except for frequent visits by tourists. The island is located 29 miles off the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island. The volcano had a deadly eruption in 1912 that killed between 10 and 20 people. The last eruption that took place on White Island was in 2001.</p>
