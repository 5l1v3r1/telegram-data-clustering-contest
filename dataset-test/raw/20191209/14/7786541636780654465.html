      <p>The merger between Atlanta-based SunTrust and Winston-Salem, N.C.-based BB&amp;T has been completed, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/suntrust-bank-merger-completed-with-creating-truist/8yBfVTumakPUll1CJ65VJM/">creating the nation's sixth-largest bank</a>, serving about 10 million consumer households, officials of the combined company announced Monday.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/suntrust-bank-merger-completed-with-creating-truist/8yBfVTumakPUll1CJ65VJM/">The merged bank</a>, now named Truist, is based in Charlotte, although Atlanta retains the corporate and investment banking division and the community bank headquarters will remain in Winston-Salem.</p>
      <p>"This is a historic moment for Truist – a financial services organization created from two companies with shared values and a deep commitment to building a better future for our clients and communities," <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/suntrust-bank-merger-completed-with-creating-truist/8yBfVTumakPUll1CJ65VJM/">said Kelly King</a>, the merged bank's chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement released Monday morning.</p>
      <p>When the companies announced the merger in February, bank officials said they expected to find cost reductions of $1.6 billion annually.</p>
      <p>Because the banks' coverage overlaps, that implies branch closures and layoffs. About 740 of the banks' more than 3,000 branches are located within two miles of each other</p>
      <p>The companies have already closed a number of branches as business shifts online.</p>
      <p>Officials said that the transition to the Truist brand will take about two years. In the meantime, bank officials said customers of SunTrust and BB&amp;T will continue to use their current branches, websites, mobile apps, checks and payment cards.</p>
      <p>For information, bank officials directed customers to <a href="http://www.truist.com/">Truist.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Officials said the merged bank will make good on previously announced plans to support low- and moderate-income communities by lending to borrowers and small businesses, as well as support of local groups.</p>
      <p>Truist said Monday it "will fulfill a financial commitment of $17.4 million annually for Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and the Piedmont Triad community, and $100 million annually for the Atlanta community."</p>
      <p>The pact was approved by shareholders earlier this year. In early November, the U.S. Department of Justice signed off after <a href="https://www.ajc.com/business/suntrust-and-sell-branches-boost-merger/gvNk9j2ZZMzcEC1Sr0WsBJ/">the banks agreed to sell 30 branches</a>, the largest such divestiture in more than a decade.</p>
      <p>Two of the locations were in Georgia, while the rest were in North Carolina and Virginia.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-suntrust-merger-receives-regulator/syFp5SGOvN66GPLgRTt1iM/">the final obstacles were cleared</a> as regulators from the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. granted approval to the plan.</p>
