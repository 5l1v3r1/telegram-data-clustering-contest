      <p>Joe Edwards will be suspended for Plymouth Argyle’s League Two game against Morecambe on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Edwards will miss out on the return to Home Park of former Pilgrims’ boss Derek Adams after he was booked in the 1-0 defeat at Cambridge United on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He picked up his fifth yellow card of the season in the 43rd minute for a foul on Reggie Lambe.</p>
      <p>It came in Argyle’s final league fixture before an amnesty on any player being banned for one match for five bookings came into force.</p>
      <p>Edwards has played the last five games at right wing-back after being used as a holding midfielder by Ryan Lowe for much of the season.</p>
      <p>His suspension could open the way for Peterborough United loan signing George Cooper to return to the starting line-up against Morecambe.</p>
      <p>Edwards is one of only two players to have started every league game for Argyle this term, with goalkeeper Alex Palmer being the other one.</p>
      <p>Left wing-back Callum McFadzean had also been an ever present until being ruled out of the game at Cambridge by a knee injury.</p>
