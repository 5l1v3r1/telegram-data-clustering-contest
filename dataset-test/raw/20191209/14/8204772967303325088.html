      <h2>Financial woes forced chain to seek court protection from creditors in August</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:08:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/barry-o-halloran-7.1010658" target="_blank">Barry O'Halloran</a></address>
      <p>The owners of Fishshack and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Ouzos">Ouzos</a> restaurants will sell some of its properties as part of a rescue deal.</p>
      <p>The chain’s owner, PBR Restaurants, sought <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=High+Court">High Court</a> protection from its creditors in August after running into financial difficulty. PBR owed €700,000 to suppliers and other unsecured creditors.</p>
      <p>As part of a rescued deal that the court approved on Monday, the company will sell restaurants in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Blackrock">Blackrock</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Dalkey">Dalkey</a> in Dublin and focus on the Fishshack business.The plan also involves a new investor providing cash for the chain.</p>
      <p>In a statement, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Neil+Hughes">Neil Hughes</a>, whom the court appointed as examiner to the company in August, said that the rescue plan would save 72 jobs.</p>
      <p>PBR had six restaurants, Fishshack Café, Ouzos and Kelly &amp; Coopers, in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The courts appoint examiners to companies that are insolvent or in financial trouble but which can show they have a reasonable prospect of survival.</p>
      <p>The examiner has up to three months to come up with a rescue plan for the company which must get the backing of a least one group of creditors who will lose out as a result.</p>
