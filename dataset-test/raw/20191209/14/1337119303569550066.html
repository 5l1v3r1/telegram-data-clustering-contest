      <h2>$50 off in every color and at several retailers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:44:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner" target="_blank">Cameron Faulkner</a></address>
      <p>Many popular headphone models, including Apple’s AirPods, Sony’s WH-1000XM3, and Beats Studio 3, were cheaper than usual during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The latest model of Bose’s flagship wireless noise-canceling headphones, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, were missing from the festivities, but you can now get them for $50 off through <a href="https://amzn.to/355xTWy">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-triple-black%2F6332173.p%3FskuId%3D6332173&amp;sharedid=gooddeals">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-with-Google-Assistant-Black%2F932544113&amp;sharedid=gooddeals">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-noise-cancelling-over-ear-headphones-700%2F-%2FA-78679757%3Fpreselect%3D76486301%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2019%2F12%2F9%2F21002640%2Fbose-noise-cancelling-700-headphones-sale-deal-amazon-best-buy-target-walmart">Target</a>.</p>
      <p>The $50 off brings the total cost of the headphones down to $349. That may not sound like much, but it’s the biggest price drop that we’ve seen on this new model yet. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"><i>The Verge</i>’s Chris Welch</a>, these offer some great features that you won’t find on any other set of cans. Highlights include USB-C charging, but more importantly, voice calls are fantastic. The Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices simultaneously over Bluetooth, and the noise cancellation effect is (unsurprisingly) great. This model currently sits atop the rest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/8/16709882/best-wireless-over-ear-headphones-to-buy">in our ranking of the best wireless headphones</a>.</p>
      <p>Usually, Beats, Bose, and Sony headphones stubbornly hang on to their retail price for quite a while, so if you’ve been waiting for a price reduction for 2019’s finest over-ear wireless headphones, now is your moment.</p>
