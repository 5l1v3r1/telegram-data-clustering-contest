      <h1>Elizabeth Warren reveals she earned $2 million from 30 years of private legal work as she feuds with Pete Buttigieg over financial transparency</h1>

        <li>Sen. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-elizabeth-warren-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Elizabeth Warren</a>'s campaign released new details about her private legal work on Sunday, revealing she earned approximately $2 million representing private clients over the course of 30 years.</li>
        <li>The new disclosures come amid a simmering feud between Warren and rival candidate former Mayor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-pete-buttigieg-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Pete Buttigieg</a> over matters of financial transparency.</li>
        <li>Shortly after the Warren campaign released more details about her legal work, the Buttigieg campaign announced they would allow reporters into Buttigieg's fundraisers and release the names of all his top fundraisers and bundlers.</li>
        <li>A spokesperson for McKinsey, the elite consulting firm where Buttigieg worked from 2007-2010, also said on Monday they would allow Buttigieg to discuss the clients he worked for, information that previously covered by Buttigieg's nondisclosure agreement with the firm.  </li>

      <p>Sen. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-elizabeth-warren-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Elizabeth Warren</a>'s campaign <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/legal-work/">released new details about her private legal work</a> on Sunday, revealing she earned approximately $2 million representing private clients over the course of 30 years.</p>
      <p>The new disclosures come amid a simmering feud between Warren and rival candidate former Mayor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-pete-buttigieg-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Pete Buttigieg</a> over matters of financial transparency.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, Buttigieg's campaign has honed in Warren's previous private legal work, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=corporate%20lawyer%20(from%3Alis_smith)&amp;src=recent_search_clicklick">seeking to cast her as a "corporate lawyer"</a> at odds with her populist campaign message, and called for her to release her tax returns from all the years she performed such private work.</p>
      <p>Before being elected to the US Senate in 2012, Warren worked as a law professor specializing in bankruptcy and consumer protection law at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law Schools. She also represented some private clients along with her academic work. </p>
      <p>Previously, Warren's campaign had released eleven years of tax returns going back to 2008. Warren aides told CNN that she didn't release 30 years of tax returns partly because it would be a double standard between her and other candidates, and because tax returns <a href="https://twitter.com/mj_lee/status/1203853617205260288">wouldn't show an itemized list</a> of all the private parties she represented and how much she earned from each case.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Warren and other candidates have called for Buttigieg to release the full details of <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-buttigieg-secret-work-mckinsey_n_5de83018e4b00149f73aef4e">his work at the elite management consulting firm McKinsey and Co</a>., where he worked as an associate approximately a decade ago.</p>
      <p>The Buttigieg campaign has said they are in the process <a href="https://twitter.com/Lis_Smith/status/1203103642083045376">of trying to release Buttigieg from the non-disclosure agreement</a> he signed pertaining his work at McKinsey, a notoriously secretive firm which makes nearly all current and former employees sign NDAs.</p>
      <p>In a Monday statement, <a href="https://twitter.com/DJJudd/status/1204152103553392642">a McKinsey spokesperson told CNN</a> that due to the "unique circumstances presented by a presidential campaign," they informed Buttigieg "that he may disclose the identity of the clients he served while at McKinsey from 2007-10" after receiving permission from those clients.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Buttigieg had also come under scrutiny from his rivals and progressive groups in recent days for <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/buttigieg-stopped-disclosing-wealthy-bundlers-and-fundraiser-hosts-after-controversy">no longer releasing the names of his top-dollar fundraisers and bundlers</a>, and declining to allow members of the press to cover his fundraising events.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the Warren campaign released more details about her legal work, the Buttigieg campaign responded in kind by announcing they would open up all of Buttigieg's fundraising events to the press and begin releasing the names of all his top fundraisers and bundlers again "within the week."</p>
      <p>"From the start, Pete has said it is important for every candidate to be open and honest, and his actions have reflected that commitment. He is the only current presidential candidate who has released the names of people raising money for his campaign, and we will continue to release additional names as more people join our growing effort," campaign manager Mike Schmul said in the statement. </p>

      <p>Buttigieg now joins Former Vice President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Joe Biden</a> in letting reporters into nearly all their fundraising events. Warren and Sen. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Bernie Sanders</a>, on the other hand, are completely relying on grassroots donations and aren't holding any private fundraisers at all.</p>
      <p>While Buttigieg released the names of his high-dollar bundlers in April, his campaign hadn't updated the list since, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-buttigieg-fundraisers-bundlers-donors_n_5debcfb5e4b07f6835b38186">according to the Huffington Post. </a></p>
