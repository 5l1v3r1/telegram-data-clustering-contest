      <p>Love or hate Bigg Boss, but honestly, you cannot ignore the show. Every year, several Indians wait for October, not because of the festive season but for the most hated show on Indian television - Bigg Boss. The hate factor is hardly a scratch on its TRPs, usually, skyhigh during its run. It is surprising that we can't stop hating the show but a lot of us still keep watching it because we feel good when we see a few failed and successful celebrities fighting with each other during their daily chores. They fight over food too. Of course, there is that section of people who will judge the hell out of you for watching Bigg Boss. Snootiness on their nose-tips, they will tell you that watching Bigg Boss is nothing short of committing a crime. But... who cares?</p>
      <p>Every middle-class Indian watches Bigg Boss for three months, get their daily dose of entertainment at 10.30 pm every night and then get over it. Till the next season. The audience never gets bored. There is more and more entertainment in every episode. Season 13 is currently on air, being hosted by Salman Khan.</p>
      <p>But what is this pull of Bigg Boss? Is it because it is the closest reflection of our society as can be?</p>
      <p>Just like the contestants inside the Bigg Boss house, our neighbours also love to peep into another's life. And of course, who doesn't love drama? We stop our work, switch off the lights in our room if it's nighttime and there's a fight at our neighbour's. Similarly, within the Bigg Boss house, without any reason, a few contestants fight with each other and others enjoy their fights.</p>
      <p>In the current season of Bigg Boss, we also got to hear some infamous dialogues. These are words all of us have encountered on the road, but hardly on national television: "Bahar jake dekh lenge", "Tu janta hai main kaun hoon", "Muh tod dunga" and so on.</p>
      <p>One of this season's favourite contestants, Sidharth Shukla, is just like any other spoilt brat, replete to the brim with attitude and aggressiveness. He is always unapologetic, even if he has done something wrong and honestly, we have all encountered that guy who is extremely Sidharth-type in his approach to life.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, Mahira Sharma is loud and abusive, much like that rich drunk pretend-'socialite' who is too noisy for no reason. During any task inside the Bigg Boss house, she shouts at other contestants without any reason. We've all faced an angry aunt like her. So, we are fine with Mahira too!</p>

      <p>Then there is your Shehnaz Gill, who is everyone's favourite but irritates all the housemates with her weird behaviour. In front of Salman Khan, she puts on a facade of innocence and acts like a child. And of course, we often come across such characters in our day-to-day life; in school, in college or at the office.</p>

      <p>Arti Singh is that person who would provoke other people to fight over nothing and can sniff out issues where there are none. She is the kind that point out a problem even when nonexistent. Such people too do exist in the real world!</p>
      <p>Also, there are people like Himanshi Khurana in our society too who remain unaffected by things that happen around them. They are just perfect.</p>
      <p>Asim Riaz is that guy who was initially judged on the basis of how he speaks and looks, but won our hearts with his attitude. Shefali Bagga once said that Shehnaz Gill is characterless, without knowing her properly. Just like society judges people on their looks and how they speak even without getting to know them.</p>
      <p>However, this season of Bigg Boss has gone a little too far because we have seen contestants body-shaming each other and people discussing age. Exactly like those relatives who judge you if you are 30 and still not married, and the neighbours who raise their eyebrows if you come home late at night, if you are overweight or dark-skinned.</p>
      <p>Hindustani Bhau is holier than thou. He makes sense a lot of times but sounds sexist at times. He keeps saying, "Ladkiyo ko beech mein nahi aana hota hai jab do ladke baat kar rahe hote hai." Yes, all of us meet this breed every day.</p>

      <p>We often criticise Bigg Boss, but miss out the larger picture: how the show is a microcosm of the very society we live in. With or without the TRPs.</p>
