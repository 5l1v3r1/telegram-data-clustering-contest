      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet face-to-face Monday with Ukrainian President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Volodymyr-Zelensky/?tps=1">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> for the first time, as the leaders hope to end a long standoff in the Donbas region.</p>
      <p>The leaders were set to meet at Elysee Palace in Paris. The <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1097075">Kremlin said</a> Putin will talk in bilateral meetings with French President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Emmanuel-Macron/?tps=1">Emmanuel Macron</a> and German Chancellor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Angela_Merkel/?tps=1">Angela Merkel</a> before a joint meeting with all four leaders.</p>
      <p>For Zelensky, who has found himself intertwined unwittingly in the impeachment inquiry of U.S. President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a>, the meeting is a chance for him to achieve a campaign promise to bring peace to eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Putin may have already scored an early victory by getting Zelensky to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50672006">agree to pull back</a> from three areas along the front line as a condition to start the talks, a concession that angered some supporters.</p>
      <p>Zelensky <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/zelensky-hopes-for-concrete-results-from-normandy-format-talks.html">said he wants</a> "tangible" results, such as the release of Ukrainian prisoners and enforcing a cease-fire in the Donbas region.</p>
      <p>"I want to understand exactly how many people we can return home and when," he said last week. "The second question is if there is a cease-fire, who is responsible for this."</p>
      <p>"Since 2016 there was no dialogue, which means there was no opportunity to talk about ending the war."</p>
      <p>There were some demonstrators on the street outside Elysee Palace involving protesters who opposed Putin's visit.</p>
