      <h1>Tema Regional GJA launches maiden awards scheme</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:24:19+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Nyarko Yeboah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Dec. 9, GNA - The Tema Regional Chapter of the Ghana Journalist Association (GJA) has launched its maiden awards scheme to recognize the contributions of journalists in the region as they strive to promote the wellbeing of Tema.</p>
      <p>The awards, which is on the theme, “Addressing the woes of industries in the industrial city, the role of stakeholders and the media,” spells out the role the media could play in reviving the many industries in the Tema Region, hence the need to inspire journalists to work.</p>
      <p>In a speech before the launch on Monday at the Tema Regional Office of the Ghana News Agency (GNA), the Chairman of the Tema Regional Chapter, Mr. Dominic Hlordzi, observed that the road leading to the organization of the awards had been rough due to the many challenges in getting sponsorship.</p>
      <p>“There were many failed promises by certain individuals and organizations, but we have decided to go ahead and organize the awards with what we have, and we believe subsequent awards would be an improvement of this one,” the Chairman indicated.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hlordzi observed that the awards were necessary because it had the capacity to inspire journalists in the region to go ahead to promote the many industries in the region, observing that, “We are working in a city which thrives on industries; there was therefore the need to promote these industries for  them to give their best to society.”</p>
      <p>In the spirit of optimism, Mr. Hlordzi recounted how the marriage between industry and the media could promote development by saying, “In fact, if the industries do well in Tema, it would rub on us. Those days when industries and companies were vibrant, Tema was bubbly and a nice place to work. So we need to do our bit in raising issues that confront them so the powers that be, can assist to improve the situation.”</p>
      <p>The first Tema GJA awards are meant for every one working in the media field in the Tema Region with published or broadcast works from January 1 to December 31, 2018 and are in two categories.</p>
      <p>Category One awards are competitive and would look at Best Reporters in the areas of Maritime, Road Safety, Water and Sanitation, Environment, Health, Education, Fisheries, Labour and Industry, Business and Finance, and Energy.</p>
      <p>The second, Honorary Category, would have five awards for persons who have contributed to the success of journalism with the Tema Region.</p>
