      <p>Actress Alia Bhatt was left stunned after her filmmaker father lost his at a reporter during a press conference to discuss sister Shaheen Bhatt’s book <i>I’ve Never Been (Un)Happier</i>. Alia was so scared witnessing her father’s extraordinary outbursts that she was even heard saying, “I warned you that this was gonna happen.” While Shaheen made a desperate plea for Bhatt to calm down as she said ‘Papa,’ Alia’s mother Soni Razdan looked visibly uncomfortable sitting next to her husband. The video of Mahesh Bhatt’s unexpected outbursts has now gone viral.</p>

      <p>In the video, a reporter is heard asking the renowned filmmaker, “So you don’t really want answers.” This appeared to evoke an angry response from him as he yelled, “There are no answers! There are pretenders who claim to have answers and they institutionalise those answers and they impose those answers with the butt-end of a gun.”</p>
      <p>Mahesh Bhatt continued, “There are no answers. Mankind doesn’t have answers. You push your children. You don’t follow things that you pretend to preach to them…I never pretended to my children that I was in possession of the virtues that people flaunt.”</p>
      <p>As Mahesh Bhatt continued with his non-stop diatribe, Soni Razdan was seen cringing with discomfort.</p>

      <p>The development came just days after Alia was seen breaking down publicly at an event in Mumbai. She had struggled to control her emotions while recalling phase when her sister Shaheen suffered from mental depression. She was pained to confess that she could not be of any help to her sister when she needed that the most.</p>
      <p>Days later, Katrina Kaif had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/ranbir-kapoors-ex-girlfriend-katrina-kaif-writes-emotional-post-shaheen-bhatt-after-alia-bhatt-breaks-down-in-public/274582/">penned a heartfelt note</a> for Shaheen while plugging her book on social media.</p>
      <p>Shaheen bares her heart in <i>I’ve Never Been (Un)Happier </i>about her struggle with depression during her growing up period.</p>
