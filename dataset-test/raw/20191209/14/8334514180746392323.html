      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will meet U.S. President Donald Trump during talks with his U.S. counterpart in Washington on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency cited a Russian foreign ministry source as saying.</p>
      <p>Lavrov’s trip to Washington for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo comes as bilateral ties are at post-Cold War lows, strained over everything from alleged election meddling to the wars in Ukraine and Syria.</p>
      <p>Time is also running out for the two sides to strike a deal that would replace or extend their New START nuclear arms treaty that is set to expire in February 2021.</p>
      <p>President Vladimir Putin last week offered the United States an extension on the deal without any pre-conditions or further discussion.</p>
      <p>Russia’s foreign ministry confirmed Lavrov’s trip to Washington in a statement. It did not mention a meeting with Trump, but Interfax cited a foreign ministry source saying there would be such a meeting.</p>
      <p>“We expect that (Lavrov) will be received by (Trump) and will hold talks with (Pompeo),” the source was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The White House neither confirmed nor denied Trump would meet Lavrov.</p>
      <p>U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election campaign in order to tilt the vote in Trump’s favor. Moscow has denied any interference.</p>
