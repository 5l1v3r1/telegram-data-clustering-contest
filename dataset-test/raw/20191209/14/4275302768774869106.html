      <p>Mr Blair, 73, from Perth, came up with the rally idea last year to raise money in a bid to find a cure for a rare hereditary condition called pheochromocytoma.</p>
      <p>His friend Sue Williamson lost her life to the condition pheo, a type of tumour which affects a handful of Scots each year, so he set up the trip with her husband Jo.</p>
      <p>Businessman Rick Wright and Mr Meldrum joined the team, who dubbed themselves the Highlanders.</p>

      <p>But the unscheduled final destination is Perth Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>Mr Blair has lodged a simple procedure action for damages against Mr Meldrum.</p>
      <p>He claims all of the charity money raised by Mr Meldrum has disappeared and that he has not handed over a penny of £480 he promised to commit.</p>
      <p>Mr Meldrum is fighting the claim and has told the court the only £480 he had put forward was the sum required to pay upfront entry for the venture.</p>
      <p>Mr Blair said: “The minimum payment I would expect him to make is the £500 or so charity money he collected and kept.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff William Wood told Mr Meldrum: “Mr Blair said he understands you had raised £480.</p>
      <p>“It is a pity matters haven’t been able to be resolved. Mediation obviously didn’t help.”</p>
      <p>Mr Meldrum said: “I took payments for the rally itself.</p>
      <p>“That was the initial entrance fee for the Mongol Rally.</p>
      <p>“The charity money included the entrance fee.</p>
      <p>“That has been paid.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff fixed a proof for early next year.</p>
      <p>When the Highlanders left John o’ Groats on the sponsored 14,000-mile drive last year, they did so after linking with Find A Cure and Cool Earth charities.</p>
      <p>Mr Meldrum went as far as Turkey then flew home to Scotland.</p>
      <p>The others continued and completed the drive to Siberia before returning with around £20,000 in total sponsorship.</p>
      <p>It is understood the court claim was for £750 to cover £500 Mr Meldrum allegedly raised, along with £250 costs for a uniform and other items.</p>
      <p>Mr Williamson, 68, a retired wine buyer from Dundee, said the <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/680100/monumental-challenge-to-save-twins-from-rare-genetic-disease/">aim of the eight-week drive</a> was to double sums already raised for research charity Find A Cure.</p>
