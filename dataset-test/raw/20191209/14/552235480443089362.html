      <p>Two <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warnings have been issued for much of Scotland as Storm Brendan is expected to batter the country.</p>
      <p>A yellow warning for wind and rain has been put in place by the Met Office for Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The yellow alert for rain will be in force from 6am to 3pm and will affect much of the west of Scotland.</p>
      <p>Another warning for high winds will affect large parts of the borders, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> and the surrounding areas, as well as some of the north east.</p>
      <p>The yellow alert for gusts will be in place from 5am until 5pm.</p>

      <p>Some areas of Scotland will see an overlap of the two warnings, including the likes of Glasgow, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greenock">Greenock</a>, Stirling, Dumfries and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ayr">Ayr</a>.</p>
      <p>Both severe weather conditions could bring delays to public transport, while some businesses and homes could be flooded, according to the forecaster.</p>
      <p>It comes after some areas of the UK faced the full force of Storm Atiyah on Sunday and Monday.</p>
