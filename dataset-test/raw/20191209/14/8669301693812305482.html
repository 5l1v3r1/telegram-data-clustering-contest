      <p>Gaurav Baliyan and Anita Sheoran registered comfortable victories to bag gold medals as India completed a perfect record on the final day of the wrestling competition at the 13th South Asian Games in Kathmandu on Monday.</p>
      <p>With both Baliyan (men’s 74kg) and Sheoran (women’s 68kg) claiming gold in their respective events, India achieved a unique feat with its grapplers finishing at the top of the podium in all 14 categories – seven gold medals each in men’s and women’s event. As per the rule of SAF Games, a country can participate in maximum 14 categories out of usual 20 weight class.</p>
      <p>It was an easy task for both Baliyan and Sheoran in their respective finals as they hardly saw any challenge from their opponent. While Sheoran, making a comeback to International circuit after 2016, took only 48 seconds to pin down her Sri Lankan opponent, young Baliyan showed great skills during his one-sided wins over opponents from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, Sakshi Malik (62Kg), Ravinder (61kg), Anshu (59kg) and Pawan Kumar (86kg) had won gold medals for India.</p>
