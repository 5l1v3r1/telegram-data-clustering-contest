      <p>Joyner Lucas took to Twitter to share his thoughts on <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259430/juice-wrld-dead-at-21-seizure-at-chicago-airport">Juice Wrld's untimely death</a>, which he believes was brought on by aspects of hip-hop culture that glorify drugs. </p>
      <p>Joyner wrote on Monday (December 9), "Juice wrld was 21. He was a product of our generation of rappers who glorified drugs and made it cool. Im blaming Yal n***az for this sh*t. All that lean and pills n***az glorify and talk about. You teaching the kids to do it. Smh you happy now? Rip @JuiceWorlddd. Gone too soon."</p>
      <p>This comes after more details were released about the moments leading up to Juice Wrld having a seizure and later dying. People that were on the plane with Juice Wrld say that <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259447/update-juice-wrld-took-pills-before-seizure-70-lbs-of-weed-found-on-jet">he took several "unknown" pills</a> during the flight, with an anonymous source saying that the rapper had a problem with Percocets. The FBI also seized 70 pounds of marijuana that was stored in luggage aboard the private jet, while two of Juice Wrld's security guards were arrested on gun charges. </p>
