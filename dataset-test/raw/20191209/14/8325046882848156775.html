        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/airbnb">Airbnb</a> has been quietly opening branded apartment buildings and condo-hotel towers in cities like Miami, Austin, Orlando, and Nashville.</li>
        <li>In Miami, the company is partnering with a developer to open a 48-story, Airbnb-branded tower called <a href="https://natiivocondos.com/">Natiivo</a> that will offer 412 condos and 192 hotel rooms – all of which can be rented out via Airbnb, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/05/airbnb-to-open-natiivo-condo-tower-in-miami/">Christopher Cameron reported for The New York Post.</a></li>
        <li>Airbnb is also opening branded apartment buildings in cities like Orlando and Nashville, where studio apartments start at $2,392 per month.</li>
        <li>In the past couple of years, Airbnb has also <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-unveils-roadmap-to-bring-magical-travel-to-everyone/">added more and more boutique hotels to its platform</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-m-a-hoteltonight/airbnb-buys-hoteltonight-in-deeper-expansion-into-hotel-booking-business-idUSKCN1QO2B4?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher">acquired hotel-booking app HotelTonight.</a></li>
        <li>These moves signal that Airbnb is expanding from its vacation rental roots and moving toward real-estate and hotels.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/airbnb">Airbnb</a> may be on its way to becoming a hotel company.</p>
      <p>In the past couple of years, the 11-year-old hospitality company has been quietly departing from its roots of listing private homes and rooms to developing branded hybrid hotel-condo towers, offering boutique hotel listings, and even buying a hotel room booking company.</p>
      <p>Airbnb is partnering with Newgard Development Group to open a 48-story tower in downtown Miami called <a href="https://natiivocondos.com/">Natiivo</a> that will offer 412 condos and 192 hotel rooms – all of which can be rented out via Airbnb, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/05/airbnb-to-open-natiivo-condo-tower-in-miami/">Christopher Cameron reported for The New York Post.</a></p>

      <p>Natiivo claims to be the first-ever property that’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/natiivomiami/photos/a.2138315149798469/2138315096465141/?type=3&amp;amp;theater">designed, built, and licensed for home-sharing,</a> but it’s not the only concept of the type Airbnb is working on.</p>
      <h3>Airbnb-branded towers are rising in cities like Miami, Austin, Nashville, and Orlando</h3>
      <p>Natiivo Miami, set to open in the spring of 2022, is one of several Airbnb-branded buildings that are popping up in places like Austin, Nashville, and Orlando.</p>
      <p>Austin, Texas will also be getting a <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/10/20/16508664/airbnb-apartment-real-estate-niido">Natiivo condo-hotel</a> in the <a href="https://www.natiivoaustin.com/">fall of 2021</a>, Curbed reported in 2017. Airbnb won’t own or manage the Natiivo towers, but it will be a branded partner and <a href="https://austin.curbed.com/2019/6/18/18683715/airbnb-austin-development-condo-hotel-natiivo-niido-rainey">provide consultation on interior design</a>.</p>
      <p>Then there’s <a href="https://www.niido.com/">Niido</a>, an Airbnb-branded apartment complex with locations in Nashville and Kissimmee, just south of Orlando, Florida, that leases “Airbnb-friendly unfurnished apartments” to residents, while guests can either book a resident’s unit on Airbnb or stay in one of the “designer apartments,” called NiidoHomes.</p>
      <p>Niido’s website includes a calculator for residents to see how much money they’d save renting out their place on Airbnb.</p>
      <p>These Airbnb-branded residences don’t come cheap. At Niido Nashville, <a href="https://www.niido.com/live-here/nashville/availabilities/beardsley">studio apartments start at $2,392 per month</a> and <a href="https://www.niido.com/live-here/nashville/availabilities/atwater">one-bedrooms start at $2,612.</a> Two-bedrooms start at $4,195. And at Natiivo Miami, <a href="https://natiivocondos.com/floor-plans/">condos are currently listed</a> from $350,000 to $1.2 million.</p>
      <h3>Airbnb is moving more and more into the hotel industry</h3>
      <p>Airbnb, which today has <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/fast-facts/">more than seven million listings</a> in 191 countries, is looking more and more like a hotel company.</p>
      <p>Last month, CEO Brian Chesky announced that the company would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/airbnb-verify-listings.html">conduct a comprehensive review of every single one of its listings</a> to verify their accuracy and safety standards, The New York Times reported.</p>
      <p>Jeff Spross of The Week called this “a big step towards <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/877011/gap-between-airbnb-hotel-shrinking">operating more like the traditional hotel business</a>.”</p>
      <p>While more and more boutique hotels have been listed on Airbnb in the past few years, Airbnb announced in early 2018 that it was making it make it <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-unveils-roadmap-to-bring-magical-travel-to-everyone/">easier for boutique hotels to list their rooms</a> on the site. Now, you can search Airbnb listings in four categories: Shared Room, Private Room, Entire Place – and Hotel Room.</p>

        <figcaption>Airbnb has made it easier to book a hotel room on its platform.<cite>Airbnb</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After Airbnb added this option, users went on to book three times as many boutique hotels in 2018 as the year before, according to the company.</p>
      <p>And earlier this year, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-m-a-hoteltonight/airbnb-buys-hoteltonight-in-deeper-expansion-into-hotel-booking-business-idUSKCN1QO2B4?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher">Airbnb bought HotelTonight</a>, an app for getting discounts on hotel rooms through last-minute bookings, and started adding the app’s hotel partners to Airbnb’s platform.</p>
      <p>These moves seem to be a departure from Airbnb’s roots as a platform that connects travelers to people willing to open up their homes to strangers.</p>
      <p>But Cameron Houser, the hotels program manager at Airbnb, <a href="https://skift.com/2018/02/27/this-is-how-airbnb-plans-to-win-over-hotels/">told Skift earlier this year</a> that she hopes the company’s expansion into hotels will bring the platform closer to being “for everyone.”</p>
      <p>“My hope is that those folks who maybe had positioned us as a place that they weren’t really going to find an accommodation can now open their minds and hearts to Airbnb a little bit more,” Houser told Skift. “And find, perhaps, a small hotel or a bed-and-breakfast that they’ve been looking for.”</p>
      <h3>Airbnb is part of a wave of companies offering hybrid accommodations that combine elements of hotels and private homes</h3>
      <p>Airbnb isn’t alone in filling a hybrid role in the hospitality industry.</p>
      <p>Startups like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sonder-has-reached-unicorn-status-with-its-newest-fundraising-round-2019-7">Sonder,</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-backed-lyrics-design-deck-shows-instagram-focused-hospitality-2019-8">Lyric</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/extended-stay-rental-company-blueground-raises-50-million-2019-10">Blueground</a> offer apartment-style rentals in properties they lease and manage. Sonder, which has a valuation of more than $1 billion, even has backing from the former CFO of Airbnb, Laurence Tosi, who is a board member.</p>
      <p>The new CEO of Trivago, Axel Hefer, recently told Business Insider that he thinks these companies are the future of travel because they they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-hotel-hybrids-new-travel-company-sonder-lyric-2019-11">combine the best parts of Airbnbs and hotels:</a> the coziness and personality of a private home with the predictability and standards of a hotel.</p>
