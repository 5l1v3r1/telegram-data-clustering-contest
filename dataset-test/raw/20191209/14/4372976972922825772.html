      <h1>Volkswagen charged with violating vehicle emission standards in Canada</h1>
      <h2>Nearly 128,000 imported vehicles and 60 counts of violating the Canadian Environmental Protection Act</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:51:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>German automaker <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> on Monday was charged with importing nearly 128,000 vehicles into <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/canada/">Canada</a> contravening the country's environmental legislation, a Canadian government agency said.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen was charged with 60 counts of breaching the Canadian Environmental Protection Act by importing vehicles that did not conform to prescribed emission standards, Environment and Climate Change Canada said.</p>
      <p>The charges included two counts of providing misleading information, and a court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 13 in the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
      <p>The company did not immediately respond to a <i>Reuters</i> request for comment.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the agency launched an investigation into the importing of certain vehicle models allegedly equipped with a prohibited "defeat device".</p>
      <p>In this case, the device was software that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system during normal vehicle use, according to the agency.</p>
      <p>News in 2015 that Volkswagen had used such devices to cheat emissions tests has so far cost the company about 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, vehicle refits and legal costs, and also triggered a global backlash against <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/diesel/">diesel vehicles</a>.</p>
