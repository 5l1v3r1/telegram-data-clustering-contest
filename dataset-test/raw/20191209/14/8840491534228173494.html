      <p>MAYO GAA secretary Dermot Butler has rounded on his critics, and those of his fellow officers, for what he described as the 'torrent of abuse' they have been subjected to in recent months.</p>
      <p>In his annual report due to be presented ot the Mayo Convention in the Broadhaven Bay Hotel, Belmullet next Sunday, Mr. Butler also fired a broadside at those faceless people on social media who fail to put their names to material published and challenged them to step forward and take a job on the board if they felt they could contribute something to the betterment of the GAA in Mayo.</p>
      <p>“It’s always easy for people to sit on the fence and criticise the officers of the board but why don’t these people put their names forward for a job. No. It’s easier to sit behind a faceless account on social media using a pseudonym.</p>
      <p>“Mayo GAA found ourselves front and centre of the media in relation to our involvement with the Mayo International Supporters Foundation and others who were also jumping on the bandwagon.</p>
      <p>“I sincerely thank my wife Sarah for all her support and patience throughout the year, especially in the past number of months which were most difficult with the torrent of abuse that was pointed at not only me but at my fellow officers.</p>
      <p>“People must remember that the officers carry out their duties in a voluntary capacity and while we don’t always do things right we do do our best for Mayo GAA,” he said.</p>
      <p>In relation to the impasse with the Mayo Supporters Foundation and chairman Tim O'Leary, Mr Butler said it was unfortunate and regrettable Mayo GAA found themselves front and centre of the media in relation to the matter.</p>
      <p>He said: “Tim O’Leary donated €150,000 to Mayo GAA in 2018 and this was put to use by the Board, I thank Tim O’Leary for his donation. That is the only money that Mayo GAA have received from either O’Leary or the Foundation,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said Mayo have never asked for any other money from O’Leary or the Foundation.</p>
      <p>“I am not going to go over all of the articles that have appeared in the newspapers, but it is disappointing that individuals used the media to tell their side of the story, a story that was not entirely correct.</p>
      <p>“Any money raised on behalf of Mayo GAA must come under the umbrella of Cairde Maigheo. The correct manner to sort out the breakdown in the relationship is around a table and at the time of going to press it is hoped that both sides will enter into a mediation process so that all sides can move on,” he added.</p>
