      <h1>Nigeria Army says using phone while approaching check points not allowed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:55:56+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author">Abisola Olasupo</a></address>
      <p>Making phone calls close to military checkpoints is not advisable, a senior Nigerian military official said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“It is a security measure for when you are approaching a checkpoint,” he said, “you don’t make phone calls,” said Major-General Usman Mohammed, Nigerian Army’s head of Civil-Military Affairs said on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The tendency is that if you are making a phone call, you might be communicating with some bad guys. Or you may use that particular device to set up some certain devices.</p>
      <p>Mohammed said the rule is not peculiar to Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“It is everywhere; people who have traveled abroad know that you don’t make phone calls when approaching a checkpoint.”</p>
      <p>Nigeria’s internal security has been under pressure for most of the decade, with Boko Haram insurgency, farmers-herders clashes, kidnapping and violent robberies all stretching the country’s security agencies.</p>
      <p>The country was ranked as the third country most impacted by terrorism on the 2019 Global Terrorism Index.</p>
