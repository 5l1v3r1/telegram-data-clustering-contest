      <p>It's been 25 years since the first PlayStation was launched and long-term gamers will remember the iconic sound that the PS1 made when it was turned on.</p>
      <p>However, did you know that it was more than just a generic jingle?</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/playstations-big-ps1-secret-revealed-21039742">Daily Star</a> , the audio clip designed to check the 'health' of your console after it had been switched on.</p>
      <p>Takafumi Fujisawa, composer of the PS1 told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2019/12/03/the-first-25-years">Game Informer:</a> "The function of this sound is to tell the user that the hardware is running like it is supposed to, and that the disc has successfully been read.</p>
      <p>To add, the swooshing reverse sound [in the PS1 sequence] is designed so that it can go into loop if the disc couldn’t be read, and we can understand if something went wrong.”</p>
      <p>The composer also added that he wanted the sound to be both practical and pleasing to the ear.</p>
      <p>He said: "I thought of the structure, selected the tones, and gathered the instruments in two weeks, and the studio work was done essentially in two days.</p>
      <p>"I kept thinking from the start that I wanted the sound image to be something exciting, like that feeling when you walk into a cinema. I really wanted to communicate and reinforce that something fun is going to happen."</p>
      <p>Retro gamers will agree that Mr Fujisawa achieved his goals, as the PlayStation jingle is one of the most notable gaming sounds around.</p>
