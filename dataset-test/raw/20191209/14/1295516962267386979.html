      <h1>Wonder Woman Spinoff? Patty Jenkins Has One 'All Mapped Out'</h1>

      <p>Although marketing on <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/wonder-woman-2/"><i>Wonder Woman 1984</i></a> has only just begun, director Patty Jenkins already has plans for a follow-up spinoff that would further expand the Amazonian superhero's world.</p>
      <p>While promoting the upcoming sequel, Jenkins confirmed she's developing a spinoff film that would focus on the Amazons and their mythical world of Themyscira. However, after directing two Wonder Woman movies back-to-back, Jenkins is looking to take some time away from the potential spinoff after <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>'s release.</p>

      <p>"We already have it all mapped out —- it’s just a matter of will we change our minds and when," Jenkins said in an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/12/wonder-woman-1984-gal-gadot-patty-jenkins-interview-ccxp-amazon-movie-inclusion-representation-diversity-feminism-women-1202804180/"><i>Deadline</i></a>. "I think what we don’t want to do is do it back-to-back. It’s been great doing these two movies back-to-back, but I think it’s important to give it a little rest in between —- and I like doing other things in between. And Gal has other things to do. I never want to make decisions too far in advance. We have to see if we both feel like making the movie we think we want to make when the moment comes."</p>

      <p>While the Amazons and Themyscira were introduced in the original 2017 film and reappeared <i>Justice League</i>, there's still plenty of unseen history to explore. The only question that remains is which elements of that history Jenkins hopes to bring to the big screen.</p>
