      <p>When Keanna Williams’ family moved from Georgia, back to Massachusetts after 13 years, it hit her mum hard.</p>
      <p>It’s now been over two years since the move but Keanna felt her mum was still struggling – and she wanted to do what she could to cheer her up.</p>
      <p>As a qualified hairdresser who posts as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecurl.therapist/">@thecurl.therapist</a>, she told her mum she was going to style her hair – but it was much more than that.</p>
      <p>Instead, she had contacted two of her mum’s oldest friends, one of whom she had only seen twice in 20 years, and arranged for them to appear in the mirror behind her as she had her hair cut.</p>
      <p>Keanna caught the touching moment on camera as her mum broke down in tears and hugged both her friends and the moment quickly went viral with over 67,000 likes.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old tells Metro.co.uk: ‘The one she is hugging is my Godmother. She went to high school with my father and introduced him and mum. She was in my mom’s wedding and they travelled together.</p>
      <p>‘The other one has been in her life for the same amount of time. I always considered them my mom’s extended sisters.’</p>

      <p>But due to where they were all living and their busy lives, her mum hadn’t seen one of her friends in over two years and she had only seen the other once in 2011 and once around 2001.</p>
      <p>After seeing how unhappy her mum was, Keanna wanted to do something to help. She reached out to one of the friends (her godmother) and asked to catch up.</p>
      <p>.She explains: I told her everything that’s been happening since and before the move. I can tell she was really hurt to hear everything we’ve been going through, I heard her crying subtly.</p>
      <p>‘I told her “she needs you guys back in her life, she needs her friends back.”</p>

      <p>‘The next day she messaged me back and told me she and my mum’s other friend would be stopping by the salon I work at to see her.</p>
      <p>‘She’s been begging me to do her hair so I figured kill 2 birds with one stone. I had them hiding behind a room divider directly behind that chair in the video and she had no idea.’</p>
      <p>The women embraced each other as they came together once more.</p>
      <p>And don’t worry, Keanna still cut her hair. A new style and old friends, what more could you need?</p>
