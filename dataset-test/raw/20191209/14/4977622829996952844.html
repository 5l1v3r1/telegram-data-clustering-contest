      <h1>Clash Over Titan: Ad For New Watch Collection That Celebrates Tamil Culture Runs Into ‘Dravidian’ Trouble</h1>

        <li>
          <p>Titan chose the collection in view of its deep-rooted connection with the State that began in 1988.</p>
          <p>Tamil Nadu accounts for around 12 per cent of Titan’s business.</p>
          <p>But many loyal to the Dravidian cause say the culture Titan is celebrating is ‘Brahminical’, and not ‘Tamil’.</p>

      <p>An advertisement released by Titan to promote its “Namma Tamil Nadu” (our Tamil Nadu) range of wristwatch collections has created a controversy on social media with views for and against it.</p>
      <p>Titan, a joint venture between Tata and Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), however, withdrew its advertisement after the controversy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/kamalmdu/status/1203723381511741440">advertisement captures</a> the rich heritage of Tamil Nadu through glimpses of its Darasuram, Brihadeeswara and Kailasanathar temples, the architecture, its flowers that “gives the fragrance of history”, the unique “<i>zha</i>” in the language and Kanchipuram silk. It says “the path of our forefathers was towards future”, adding that it is the home to humanity.</p>
      <p>Titan’s Chief Development Officer Revathi Kant <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/our-design-competence-has-been-nurtured-through-elaborate-consumer-research-titan-chief-design-officer/article29974998.ece">told </a>media during the release of the “Namma Tamil Nadu” range that the collection was based on inspirations of Tamil Nadu’s textile crafts, temple architecture and Tamil scripts.</p>
      <p>She said Titan chose the collection in view of its deep-rooted connection with the State that began in 1988. Tamil Nadu contributes 12 per cent of Titan’s business and the company sees that there is a lot more to unearth from Tamil Nadu’s creativity point of view.</p>
      <p>While the advertisement on the collection received a positive response from many on social media, there were some, describing themselves to be supporters of Dravidian ideology, who tried to portray it as a negative development.</p>
      <p>For sometime on Saturday (7 December), the hashtag #boycottitanwatches trended on Twitter, forcing Titan to withdraw its advertisement.</p>
      <p>One critic <a href="https://twitter.com/AMerukar/status/1203911880168767488">said </a>it showcased the “Brahminical” side of Tamil Nadu and the advertisement had “visible markers against Dravidian culture”.</p>
      <p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/DravidanTalkies/status/1203617342225141760">said </a>that Brahminical books, culture, food and anti-Tamil writers were projected as Tamil Nadu's culture and there was nothing Tamil in it.</p>
      <p>But the objection to the advertisement seems to be a caricature of freedom fighter Subramaniya Bharathi and a glimpse of his name among the books that it shows on a bookshelf. The advertisement did not have anything about food.</p>
      <p>There were many who found nothing wrong with the advertisement with one person <a href="https://twitter.com/itzdvs/status/1203645011809538048">saying </a>he had ordered a Titan watch online.</p>
      <p>Another person <a href="https://twitter.com/ByRakeshSimha/status/1203879683718205441">vouched </a>for its brand, while a woman, who <a href="https://twitter.com/Ashwini_Raje/status/1203880674572156928">found </a>the advertisement “beautifully encapsulated”, said Titan probably reacted needlessly to the reaction of “Hindu TN”.</p>
      <p>The "Dravidian reaction" to the advertisement forced many to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pranavsinh9/status/1203918593638969344">resolve </a>that they will buy Titan watches henceforth.</p>
      <p>One person <a href="https://twitter.com/AkkiPaliwal01/status/1203605259823677440">posted </a>the photo of the watch and wondered why there was a boycott call when it was equipped with the rich canvass of culture, art, and language of Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>The advertisement has, in fact, won more appreciation and “spot on” comments with some even saying they would like to gift it to their friends.</p>
      <p>Kant, during the release of the collection, said the design was as simple as possible with an idea to have a mass appeal.</p>
      <p>Going by the positive <a href="https://twitter.com/brakoo/status/1203658624481935362">responses </a>to the advertisement, looks like it could be a good gift item for New Year and Pongal.</p>
