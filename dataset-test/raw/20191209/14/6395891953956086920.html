      <p><a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/12/05/anne-arundel-county-17-year-old-mom-grandmother-charged-in-9-month-old-boys-overdose-death/">According to WJZ-TV</a>, Alexus Lorraine Taylor, 17, and her mother, Laurie Ann Taylor, 43, were arrested Thursday on manslaughter, child abuse and reckless endangerment charges in the death of Alexus Taylor’s infant son.</p>
      <p>On July 27, Anne Arundel County emergency crews responded to a 911 call about an unresponsive baby at an Orchard Beach home, <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/12/05/anne-arundel-county-17-year-old-mom-grandmother-charged-in-9-month-old-boys-overdose-death/">WJZ reported</a>. They rushed the child, Niyear, to a nearby hospital, and doctors pronounced him dead, authorities said.</p>
      <p>An autopsy later revealed that the baby had ingested heroin and fentanyl, <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/maryland-mom-grandmother-baby-heroin-fentanyl-death">WJLA-TV reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Investigators learned that Laurie Taylor, Alexus Taylor and Laurie’s other daughter had gone to Baltimore to purchase heroin capsules July 26, <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/12/05/anne-arundel-county-17-year-old-mom-grandmother-charged-in-9-month-old-boys-overdose-death/">the news outlets</a> <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/maryland-mom-grandmother-baby-heroin-fentanyl-death">reported</a>. Niyear was in the car during the trip, authorities said.</p>
      <p>After the group returned to their house, they couldn’t find one of the capsules, authorities said. Laurie and Alexus Taylor then went out again to buy more drugs, <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/12/05/anne-arundel-county-17-year-old-mom-grandmother-charged-in-9-month-old-boys-overdose-death/">according to WJZ</a>. They returned to find Niyear wheezing, investigators said.</p>
      <p>Although Laurie Taylor said “she questioned whether or not the infant had ingested the heroin capsule,” the pair “decided to take a ‘wait and see’ approach,” police said, <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/maryland-mom-grandmother-baby-heroin-fentanyl-death">according to WJLA</a>. The mother and grandmother, who co-slept with Niyear that night, awoke to find the boy unresponsive, officials said.</p>
