      <p>An employee who wishes to remain anonymous said the alarm system had been ripped out and doors damaged.</p>
      <p>"So much damage has been caused to the inside and outside," they said.</p>
      <p>"They tried to break into the living quarters. It was horrific and just so scary.</p>
      <p>"The police were called so they ran off and left the spade they used to break in.</p>
      <p>"An alarm bell has been ripped off the side of the building and the system has been cut up.</p>
      <p>"We're still working out exactly what's been taken but so much damage has been caused.</p>
      <p>"We're going to need a whole new alarm system and two new doors."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800555111 or <a href="http://crimestoppers-uk.org/">crimestoppers-uk.org</a></p>
