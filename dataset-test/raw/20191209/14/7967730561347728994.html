      <p><b>Los Angeles: </b>The Golden Globes will not be lacking Australian star power with Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, Cate Blanchett and Toni Collette picking up nominations.</p>
      <p>Crowe, who was a regular nominee at the Golden Globes and Oscars in the early 2000s, has been on the outer for more than a decade.</p>

      <p>He was welcomed back on Monday when he picked up a Globe nomination for portraying controversial Fox News boss Roger Ailes in the TV mini-series <i>The Loudest Voice</i>.</p>
      <p>Crowe will compete against Sacha Baron Cohen (<i>The Spy</i>), Sam Rockwell (<i>Fosse/Verdon</i>), Christopher Abbott (<i>Catch-22</i>) and Jared Harris (<i>Chernobyl</i>) in the limited series or TV movie best actor category.</p>
      <p>Kidman cleaned up on the awards show circuit two years ago for her complex and challenging performance as Celeste Wright in the first season of <i>Big Little Lies</i>, and she was rewarded again on Monday for season two of the TV series based on Australian author Liane Moriarty's novel.</p>
      <p>Kidman has plenty of competition in the lead actress in a TV drama race with her Big Little Lies co-star Reese Witherspoon nominated for her new show <i>The Morning</i> along with Jennifer Aniston (<i>The Morning</i>), Oscar winner Olivia Colman (<i>The Crown</i>) and Jodie Comer (<i>Killing Eve</i>).</p>

      <p>Rising Australian star Sarah Snook was a surprise snub in the category for her scene-stealing role in the TV drama <i>Succession</i>.</p>
      <p>Robbie's pursuit of an Oscar remains on track with her nod for best supporting actress in the movie <i>Bombshell</i>, also about Ailes' reign of workplace sexual harassment at Fox News.</p>
      <p>Robbie's category is also stacked with A-Listers; Jennifer Lopez (<i>Hustlers</i>), Kathy Bates (<i>Richard Jewell</i>), Annette Bening (<i>The Report</i>) and Laura Dern (<i>Marriage Story</i>) are also nominated.</p>
      <p>Blanchett, nominated for best actress in a musical or comedy movie for <i>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</i>, is up against Emma Thompson (<i>Late Night</i>), Beanie Feldstein (<i>Booksmart</i>), Awkwafina (<i>The Farewell</i>) and Ana De Armas (<i>Knives Out</i>).</p>
      <p>Collette, nominated in the supporting actress in a TV series or movie category for <i>Unbelievable</i>, also faces star-studded competition with Meryl Streep (<i>Big Little Lies</i>), Patricia Arquette (<i>The Act</i>), Helena Bonham Carter (<i>The Crown</i>) and Emily Watson (<i>Chernobyl</i>) receiving nods.</p>
      <p>Another surprise snub was New Zealand's Taika Waititi who missed out on directing kudos for his comedy/drama <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>, but the film did score a nod in the best comedy/musical picture category.</p>
      <p>The streaming service Netflix and the film <i>Marriage Story</i> were the overall winners at the nomination ceremony.</p>
      <p>Netflix dominated Hollywood's traditional movie studios with 17 nominations.</p>
      <p>Sony and Disney were next with eight and six nods respectively.</p>

      <p>Netflix was also king in the TV categories with 17, followed by HBO's 15 and Hulu with five.</p>
      <p>In a sign of the times, US free-to-air TV networks NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox all came up empty-handed.</p>
      <p>The Globes ceremony will be held in Beverly Hills on January 5.</p>
