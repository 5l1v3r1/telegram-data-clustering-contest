      <p>Residential placements for children in care are costing a Devon council around £5,000 a week each, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>That is the figure for a typical case reported to councillors in Torbay where the children’s services department is facing an estimated overspend of £6.3million by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>A report setting out the financial pressures facing the authority says the biggest issue is from children’s social care.</p>
      <p>Overall the number of looked-after children fell by six over the six months to 351 at the end of September 2019. </p>
      <p>But the report adds that the number in residential placements was up from 28 a year ago to 44, and there has also been an increase in complex needs cases.</p>
      <p>The report says: “Increases to placement numbers without a reduced demand elsewhere would further increase the service overspend as would any extensions of placements where there are planned end dates.”</p>
      <p>It says the spending pressure on the services has gone up by more than £2m since June.</p>
      <p>The report details savings across other services and a plan to move £3.6m from reserves to balance the books by the end of March 2020.</p>
      <p>It reveals the council is spending £3.7m on agency staff for children’s services including to cover 44 vacant posts at the end of September.</p>
      <p>Previous figures have shown Torbay has had one of the highest rates of looked-after children in the country.</p>
      <p>A new improvement plan for children’s social care in Torbay aims to achieve a ‘good’ rating by April 2021.</p>
      <p>Torbay Council was served with improvement notices in 2011 and 2012 and its children's services were judged inadequate in 2016.</p>
      <p>The authority’s children’s services ended the last financial year overspent by £5m, on top of a £3m increase in funding the previous year.</p>
      <p>Councils across the country are facing increased costs caused by more looked-after children and the rising cost of complex cases.</p>
      <p>In Torbay, children’s services accounts for around a third of the council’s £111m spending.</p>
      <p>The finance update report for July to September - the second quarter of the financial year - is due to be considered by the council’s Overview and Scrutiny Board on Wednesday, December 11.</p>
