      <p>A Bristol University student who nearly died after falling from the roof of a nightclub has had an emotional reunion – with the stranger who helped save his life.</p>
      <p>Tom Biggart fell asleep on Zero Degrees bar in Colston Street during a night out with a friend in December 2017.</p>
      <p>He fell 35ft feet onto the ground below, suffering horrific injuries to his leg and head, and was found by a passer-by, known only as Simon.</p>
      <p>Tom, who was studying languages at the University of Bristol, was rushed to Southmead Hospital’s intensive care unit where surgeons performed life saving surgery.</p>

      <p>He was in a coma for seven weeks, with his family by his bedside, before being transferred to the Oxford Centre for Enablement where he spent four months in a rehabilitation unit re-learning simple, everyday tasks.</p>
      <p>Tom, 24, eventually returned to live at home in Kingsutton, attending rehab sessions once a week, and began working as a gardener for a family friend.</p>
      <p>He returned to Bristol this autumn to finish his fourth year of his language degree and set about trying to find the man he knew only as Simon.</p>
      <p>Following an appeal in the Bristol Post, Simon got in touch.</p>
      <p>The pair met for the first time this week and enjoyed lunch together at Pinkmans in Park Street.</p>
      <p>Tom said: “It was a big moment.</p>
      <p>“It’s not often you get to meet the person who saved your life and say thank you.</p>
      <p>“We chatted and we hugged. It was so great to meet him.”</p>
      <p>Tom said that on that fateful night Simon, who lives in Bristol, told him he was out walking his dog in the early hours and heard a large thud.</p>
      <p>“He actually heard me fall from the roof, “ said Tom.</p>

      <p>“He then called the ambulance and waited with me until crews arrived.</p>
      <p>“We sat and chatted about what happened.”</p>
      <p>The pair now plan to stay in touch while Tom, who lives with his brother Ed in the city, finishes his degree.</p>
      <p>“He is such an awesome guy and we are definitely going to stay in touch.”</p>

      <p>Following his fall Tom’s friends at Bristol University rallied together to raise nearly £14,000 for Southmead Hospital.</p>
      <p>Tom has written blogs about his experiences following his fall which can be read at https://lukciestmanalive.com.</p>
