      <p>Four persons, including two women, were killed when the car in which they were travelling back home in Nizamabad from Hyderabad hit a roadside banyan tree after passing the Krishna Mandir on National Highway-44 at Jangampally under Biknoor police station limits early on Monday.</p>
      <p>All the four identified as Manthani Lavanya (35), Susheel (28), Prashanth (26) and Roshini (14) died on the spot.
