      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/lauren-drain/">Lauren Drain’s</a> most recent Instagram post is proving to fans why she was named “The World’s Sexiest Nurse.” As those who follow her on social media know, Drain is never shy when it comes to showing off her amazing figure for fans in a wide-range of sexy outfits. The blond bombshell is currently pregnant but that hasn’t stopped her from posing for plenty of hot photos that show off her pregnant figure, which is exactly what she did earlier today.</p>
      <p>In the caption of the image, the former nurse told fans that she doesn’t always feel glamorous when she’s pregnant but a recent maternity shoot helped to boost her confidence. In the gorgeous shot, Drain appeared front and center, looking straight into the camera with a serious look on her face. The stunner wore her long locks down and waved in addition to a stunning application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipstick.</p>
      <p>She put her amazing figure, including her growing baby bump on full display while rocking a curve-hugging pink dress that showed off plenty of cleavage. The bottom of the dress was sheer and lacy and offered glimpses of her fit stems. The stunning number included a long pink train as well, which was seen blowing at her back.</p>
