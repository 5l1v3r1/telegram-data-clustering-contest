      <p>Amazon has just <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">dropped the price</a> of the iRobot Roomba 671 down to $195, in its Gold Box Deal of the Day today. This brings it even lower than the Roomba 675 was during Black Friday (it was $199). The Roomba 671 and 675 are very, very similar.</p>
      <p>This is part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, so this price is only good until midnight PST tonight. So if you're interested in buying the iRobot Roomba 671 today, don't waste any time.</p>
      <p>The iRobot Roomba 671 is a pretty impressive robot vacuum â€“ especially not that it's under $200.</p>

      <p>With the iRobot Roomba 671, you're going to get the patented 3-stage cleaning system that will loosen, lift and suck up all of the dirt, dust and hair from hard floors and carpet. It also has dual multi-surface brushes that work together to grab dust, dirt and large debris. It also has an auto-adjusting cleaning head that will adapt its height to effectively clean carpets and hard floors.</p>
      <p>The iRobot Roomba 671 has a full suite of sensors that will intelligently navigate around your home and map out your home. This is going to allow you to see your floor plan in the iRobot HOME app. This also allows you to see where it has cleaned and where it needs to clean still. Meaning that you can also tell it specifically where to go, if say you only want it to clean a specific room right now.</p>
      <p>Finally, the iRobot Roomba 671 also works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Meaning that you can use your voice to control the iRobot Roomba 671 using either personal assistant. So no matter which platform you prefer to use, you can control your new Roomba with it.</p>
