      <h1>Deiga appeals for rehabilitation of Peki Hospital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:32:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Caleb Kuleke, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Peki (V/R) Dec. 09, GNA - Deiga Kwadwo Dei XII, Paramount Chief of Peki Traditional Area, in the South Dayi District of the Volta Region has appealed to Government to rehabilitate and retool the Peki Government Hospital.</p>
      <p>He said due to the strategic location of the Hospital on the Eastern Corridor Road, there was the need to retool the facility to respond effectively to accident and other emergency cases on the stretch. </p>
      <p>Deiga was speaking at this year’s Gbidukorza (Gbidukor festival) at Peki-Tsame on the theme: “Promoting Safety and Health Standards - Our Shared Responsibility,” aimed at mobilising financial resources to establish a trauma and emergency centre at the Peki Government Hospital.</p>
      <p>He commended Government for its social intervention programmes and urged it to pay attention to the Eastern Corridor Road and the Peki Government Hospital.</p>
      <p>Togbega Gabusu VI, Paramount Chief of Gbi Traditional Area, underscored the importance of the theme because people could focus attention on societal development only when they “are safe and healthy.”</p>
      <p>He lamented that for many years, both Hohoe and Peki Hospitals were without some basic necessities, such as ambulances and appealed to Government to retool the two facilities.</p>
      <p>“We are pleading that in view of the continued threat to lives in the absence of functioning ambulance services for both the Hohoe and Peki Hospitals, government should translate into concrete result the promises its key officials made at various public fora on this issue,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Togbega Gabusu also appealed to Government, development partners, philanthropists and other benevolent organisations to support Gbidukor in its Arts and Craft Village project, saying “we believe this project will help address the growing unemployment situations and further open up the area to economic growth.”</p>
      <p>He said the deplorable condition of the roads within the Gbi and the Peki Traditional Ares was a major factor militating against the rapid socio-economic development of the areas and appealed to Government to address the situation.</p>
      <p>Herbert Dzako Awuah, Co-chairman of the National Steering Committee of the festival said in line with the theme, the Gbidukor embarked on health promotion activities, and registered 1,000 children onto the National Health Insurance Scheme.</p>
      <p>Gbidukorza is celebrated annually to mark the reunification of the two Gbi States- Hohoe and Peki after more than 300 years of being separated by migration and colonial factors.</p>
