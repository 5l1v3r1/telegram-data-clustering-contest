      <h4>Bassey Anthony, Uyo</h4>
      <p>The Uyo Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) said it has secured over 60 convictions in Court against corrupt persons from January this year till date.</p>
      <p>Head of EFCC in the zone, Mr. Garba Dugum said the anti-graft commission has also recovered N300million from corrupt individuals in the zone.</p>
      <p>He added that commission is investigating corruption cases while pursuing others in court, adding he was optimistic that more convictions would be gotten.</p>
      <p>The EFCC boss stated this on Monday on the sidelines of a road walk round the streets of Uyo to mark this year’s International Anti-corruption Day with the theme: ” Zero Tolerance for Corruption”.</p>
      <p>“From January till date our record of conviction is more than 60 and if you round the country, I think we have over 300. In Uyo, I think we have a recovery of N300million. This is small compared to other places but at least we are moving forward”.</p>

      <p>He said the Uyo Zonal office of commission has spread it’s dragnet all over it’s area of operation to fish out corruption individuals and would spare no one found to be involved in any act of sleaze.</p>
      <p>On the essence of the international anti-corruption day, Dugum said, “Today is an awareness campaign against corruption.That is why we have come out with other stakeholders to go round all the streets to get people sensitized, to show them the ills of corruption. And that if we allow corruption to go on we will not be able to get the impact of the Commonwealth.</p>
      <p>He said it was not true that the EFCC was into selective fight against corruption as bandied around by some politicians, insisting that recent happening have proven the commission to be unbiased.</p>
      <p>“It is not true and I can’t succumb to that accusation. You can see from recent developments that there some persons even in this government who have been investigated, prosecuted and judgments obtained in court against them”.</p>
