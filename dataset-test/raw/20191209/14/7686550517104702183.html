      <h1>Man born without arms or legs forced to prove he can't work three times a year</h1>
      <h2>Kevin Donnellon, 58, was one of the children affected in the thailidomide tragedy which saw approximately 2,000 babies born with malformed limbs as a side effect of a sedative drug</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:09:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Cardy, Amardeep Bassey</a></address>
      <p>A man born with out arms or legs has slammed the benefits system after being asked to fill in a 24-page ‘fit-to-work' questionnaire for the third time.</p>
      <p>Kevin Donnellon, a Thalidomide survivor, from Crosby, Merseyside was told he needed to full the questionnaire to be able to maintain receiving his advantages.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old was one of round 2,000 infants affected by the morning illness drug Thalidomide.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/man-born-without-arms-legs-21046360">Mirror Online</a> ‘It isn’t like my legs and arms have grown."</p>
      <p>The dad-of-two worked hard up until 15 years ago when he began to suffer from back problems from wearing prosthetic legs and complications from type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>Kevin also has a degree in social sciences and works with adults with learning disabilities.</p>
      <p>He said: "My last paid job was 15 years ago. Now I’m not as healthy.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got severe backache from the artificial legs I used to wear – they weren’t the fantastic prosthetics you get these days.</p>

      <h3>"It feels vindictive"</h3>
      <p>"I’ve also got type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>“This government seems to have targeted disabled people.</p>
      <p>"I have a lot of disabled friends who are terrified when they get these letters they’re going to have benefits taken away.</p>
      <p>“Twice in the last year I’ve had to fill in questionnaires. Now I’ve a third, due back on December 25. Merry Christmas.</p>
      <p>"It feels vindictive. The questions are intrusive, very personal.</p>
      <p>“I was born like this – you’d think my details would be on the system.”</p>
      <p>Kevin had to fill out a form for PIP payments to replace his Disability Living Allowance, and two “capability for work” forms for Universal Credit, to replace Employment and Support Allowance.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’ve worked in the past, but I can’t do anything full-time. All these cuts are simply cruel."</p>
      <p>The DWP said the reassessments were part of the transition from DLA to PIP and those with life-long conditions would then only have “light-touch” 10-year reviews.</p>
      <p>A spokesman added: “Mr Don­nellon has been awarded ESA indefinitely following a recent reassessment and the highest rate of PIP with a light-touch review in 10 years.”</p>
