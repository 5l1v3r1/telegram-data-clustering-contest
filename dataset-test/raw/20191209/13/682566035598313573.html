      <p>Cape Town - South Africa Sevens coach <b>Neil Powell</b> has added Lions star <b>Hacjivah Dayimani</b> to his squad for the Cape Town Sevens starting on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Blitzboks returned home having bagged the opening leg of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens series in Dubai on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Dayimani made his debut for the <b>SA Sevens Academy</b> in their victory at the Dubai International Invitational tournament.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Dayimani will take the place of Christi Grobbelaar who travelled with the Blitzboks to Dubai as the 13th player.</p>
      <p>Dayimani will have to wait to hear whether he'll be part of the final 12-man squad - potentially at the expense of either Chris Dry or Ryan Oosthuizen - when Powell confirms his final squad for the tournament on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Blitzboks have been <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/Sevens/blitzboks-in-pool-of-death-at-cape-town-sevens-20191209">drawn in Pool A</a> and will face minnows Japan at 20:03 on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Saturday they have two far tougher assignments against defending series champions Fiji (13:51) and last season's runners-up, the USA (20:03).</p>
