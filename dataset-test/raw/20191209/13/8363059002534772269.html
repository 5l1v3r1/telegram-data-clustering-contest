      <h1>The Upcoming OnePlus 8 Series Could Feature a Budget Lite Model</h1>

      <p>Next year might see OnePlus return to offering consumers a low cost handset alongside its flagship smartphones.</p>
      <p>Following rumours of a premium <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/oneplus-8-pro-120-hz-display/">OnePlus 8 Pro boasting a 120hz display</a>, it seems that the company is also reintroducing a more affordable option, harking back to the days of the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2015/10/oneplus-x-is-a-low-cost-phone-thats-shockingly-good-looking/">shockingly inexpensive OnePlus X</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-8-lite-renders-design-punch-hole-display-camera/">91Mobiles and OnLeaks</a> have released CAD-based renders of the device along with minimal specs based on what's visible.</p>

      <p>The smartphone will reportedly have either a 6.4-inch or 6.5-inch display with a hole-punch camera front and centre. The lack of a visible fingerprint scanner suggests it'll be an under-display scanner. The screen itself will be flat rather than curved, although the rear comprises a curved glass panel to jazz things up a bit.</p>
      <p>The rectangular raised rear camera will have just two lenses, a flash, and a possible ToF sensor. Meanwhile, at the bottom, there appears to be a USB-C port and no headphone jack, because mobile phone manufacturers suck.</p>
      <p>If the pricing follows on from the super cheap OnePlus X, that <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2015/11/oneplus-x-review-great-on-the-outside-just-ok-on-the-inside/">barely brushed the £200 price point</a>, we could see a OnePlus phone launching with a price tag of less than £500 for a change. We'll have to wait for a few more solid details before speculating too much on all of this though, so take the news with a pinch of salt.
