      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:40:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The government on Monday said there is no proposal under consideration for waiver of education loans.</p>
      <p>In the last three years from 2016-17 to March 2019, the amount of outstanding education loans rose from Rs 67,685.59 crore to Rs 75,450.68 crore in September 2019, as per data provided by public sector banks.</p>
      <p>More than 90 per cent of these accounts are standard as on March 31 this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Lok Sabha.</p>
      <p>The minister also said that as reported by public sector banks, no case of suicide by students due to unbearable pressure from banks to repay education loans has been reported.</p>
      <p>In a written reply, she said banks have been sensitised to adopt a non-coercive strategy for recovery of education loans.</p>
      <p>"Further, there is no proposal under consideration for waiver of education loans," she noted.</p>
      <p>According to her, data linking education loans sanctioned by banks with securing of jobs is not centrally maintained.</p>
