      <h1>Leicester City among clubs keen on Charlton Athletic forward Macauley Bonne?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/charlton-athletic/"><b>Charlton Athletic</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/macauley-bonne/"><b>Macauley Bonne</b></a> has reportedly emerged as a transfer target for three clubs ahead of the January transfer window.</h2>

      <p>Having left Leyton Orient for Charlton in the summer, Bonne has contributed six goals and one assist from 14 appearances in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Despite being less than six months into a three-year contract at The Valley, <i>talkSPORT</i> claims that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leicester-city/"><b>Leicester City</b></a> are one of three teams who are monitoring the 24-year-old's development.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamie-vardy/"><b>Jamie Vardy</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kelechi-iheanacho/"><b>Kelechi Iheanacho</b></a> are established as the top two strikers at the King Power Stadium, it is said that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brendan-rodgers/"><b>Brendan Rodgers</b></a> is looking to bolster his options in the final third.</p>
      <p>However, with three weeks still remaining before the start of 2020, the report says that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/newcastle-united/"><b>Newcastle United</b></a> are currently considered to be the marginal frontrunners for Bonne.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/fulham/"><b>Fulham</b></a> are also ready to offer the attacker an opportunity to make the short switch across London.</p>
