      <p>Manchester United pulled off the unlikeliest of wins against rivals Manchester City at Etihad Stadium on Saturday night. Goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial guaranteed the visitors all three points as they held on to the lead despite a late flurry of attacks from Manchester City in the second half. Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer painted a joyous figure as he made it two back-to-back wins in the Premier League (Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City). Meanwhile, defending champions Manchester City dropped more points on the weekend with Liverpool now holding a 14-point advantage over them at the top of the league table.</p>
