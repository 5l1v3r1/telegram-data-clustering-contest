      <h1>Father of ex-police minister granted bail over alleged hit-and-run</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:16:52+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Ex-NSW police minister Troy Grant’s father, who is accused of killing a pedestrian while drink driving at more than twice the legal limit, will spend Christmas with his family after being released on bail.</p>
      <p>Kenneth Wayne Grant appeared in Burwood Local Court on Monday, where he was granted conditional bail by magistrate Lisa Stapleton.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old, who previously lived alone, must report to Gladesville police station on a weekly basis, live with his son Troy in Chiswick and cannot drink alcohol.</p>
      <p>Ms Stapleton said Mr Grant had no criminal history, strong community ties, no criminal associations and was a “man of impeccable character”.</p>
      <p>However, she said Mr Grant had allegedly committed a “serious offence” that resulted in a death, and police had a strong case against him.</p>
      <p>If Mr Grant been refused bail, the retired police officer would potentially have been in custody for more than 12 months with a custodial sentence likely to follow, Ms Price said, adding he posed only a “slight flight risk”.</p>
      <p>The court also heard Mr Grant might have cognitive impairment issues requiring investigation relating to his culpability.</p>
      <p>Mr Grant was arrested on Sunday after allegedly hitting Tony Greenfield, 62, with his ute about 11.30pm on November 30 at Flat Road in the Maitland suburb of Bolwarra.</p>
      <p>The scientist, a friend of Mr Grant’s, died of his injuries in Newcastle’s John Hunter Hospital.</p>
      <p>The ute that allegedly struck him had left the scene. A short time later, police spotted the gold Mazda and attempted to stop it, but the driver ignored them and a pursuit began.</p>
      <p>The low-speed chase through local streets ended on Maitland’s High Street after the vehicle mounted the footpath, detectives say.</p>
      <p>Police have previously said Mr Grant returned a positive roadside breath test and a subsequent analysis returned a reading of 0.108.</p>
      <p>Mr Grant was initially charged with a mid-range drink-driving offence and driving recklessly while not stopping for police.</p>
      <p>After further investigations, he was charged with dangerous driving occasioning death and failing to stop offences.</p>
      <p>His son Troy – who was NSW police minister from April 2015-March 2019 – broke down outside court on Monday, saying his father had “offered to trade his own life” to bring back Mr Greenfield.</p>
      <p>“That’s not possible,” Troy Grant said.</p>
      <p>“The only thing we can do is try to get his family and everyone the answers as to how and why this tragedy has occurred and that journey starts today.”</p>
      <p>Mr Grant said his father was devastated by what had happened.</p>
      <p>“I’m devastated. All he’s talked about is what a terrific person Tony and his family were. He can’t speak high enough of him,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Grant is next due to face Maitland Local Court on December 18.</p>
