      <p>Johannesburg - The SACP looks set to rally behind President Cyril Ramaphosa's leadership of the ANC.</p>
      <p>The party is also likely to review its decision to contest local government elections, saying internal battles in the ANC forced members to review a decision they took at their national congress in 2017.</p>
      <p>This is contained in the SACP's discussion document of its special national congress which starts in Kempton Park on Monday.</p>
      <p>The SACP said it had played an “absolutely” critical part in the run-up to the ANC December 2017 national conference “in opening up space for the anti-state capture platform centred around Ramaphosa being able to hold public meetings and rallies in localities that were otherwise no-go areas”.</p>
      <p>The party, however, admits in the discussion document that there were people who were going to raise the question of contesting elections independently for the 2021 local government elections.</p>
