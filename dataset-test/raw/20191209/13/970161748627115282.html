        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/beyonce-knowles/">Beyonce</a> has a bold new attitude towards her body as the singer admits she gives ‘zero f***s’ about her weight gain, and we are living for it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Single Ladies singer has surprised fans this week by giving a rare <a href="http://www.ELLE.com/uk">interview to Elle UK</a>, in which she answers questions from fans in a candid Ask Me Anything.</p>
      <p>In one of the questions, Beyonce is asked how she feels when people are constantly commenting on her fluctuating weight, especially since giving birth to twins Rumi and Sir in June 2017.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old replied: ‘If someone told me 15 years ago that my body would go through so many changes and fluctuations, and that I would feel more womanly and secure with my curves, I would not have believed them.</p>
      <p>‘But children and maturity have taught me to value myself beyond my physical appearance and really understand that I am more than enough no matter what stage I’m at in life.’</p>
      <p>She added brilliantly: ‘Giving zero f***s is the most liberating place to be. Also knowing true beauty is something you cannot see. I wish more people focused on discovering the beauty within themselves rather than critiquing other folks’ grills.’</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the session, the Formation singer discusses buying out her Ivy Park athleisure brand from Phillip Green’s Topshop last year following allegations of sexual harassment from several of his staff members. Green vehemently denied the claims.</p>

      <p>Beyonce admits buying back the brand was her ‘taking a chance’ on herself and is now ‘proud’ to be a part of the Adidas family.</p>
      <p>While the original Ivy Park collections with Topshop were aimed at women, Bey reveals the line line is ‘gender-neutral’ as she realised men were wearing the clothes.</p>
      <p>‘The way they have embraced the brand is an unexpected gift,’ she said.</p>
      <p>One fan asked how she felt about losing out on a Creative Arts Emmy for her Netflix concert movie Homecoming, but Beyonce said that having multiple miscarriages ‘taught [her] to mother [herself]’.</p>

      <p>‘My true win is creating art and a legacy that will live far beyond me. That’s fulfilling,’ she admitted.</p>
      <p>Beyonce usually shocks us whenever she acts like a ‘normal’ person rather than the superstar she is and frankly, her regular karaoke choices have blown us away.</p>
      <p>Because no, Queen Bey doesn’t show off her vocals by belting out Whitney Houston or Celine Dion – she prefers Escape (The Pina Colada Song) and Hotel California because ‘the guitar solo is [her] jam!’</p>
      <p>Well, we never.</p>
      <p>Beyonce appears on the cover of Elle UK modelling pieces from Ivy Park x Adidas and the photoshoot took place in a nondescript corner of Crenshaw in Los Angeles, with locations including a local hair salon, bodega, laundromat and, most brilliantly, a wig shop.</p>
