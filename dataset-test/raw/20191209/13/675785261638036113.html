      <h1>Laurent Koscielny addresses Arsenal struggles after controversial summer exit</h1>
      <h2>The former Gunners defender left the club in acrimonious circumstances over the summer to join Bordeaux and has had his say on his ex side's current troubles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:51:32+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny thinks the Gunners must come together to overcome their nightmare spell as they look to end their dreadful recent form when they take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg's side are without a win in seven Premier League games and sit ten points off the Champions League qualification spots in 11th place.</p>
      <p>Koscielny left the club to join Bordeaux in the summer and became an unpopular figure with supporters when he refused to go on the club's pre-season tour to the USA in order to force through his move.</p>
      <p>But speaking to <a href="https://www.canalplus.com/theme/emissions/pid1323-canal-football-club.html">Canal Football Club</a> Koscielny insisted he wishes his ex-club nothing but the best as they seek to bounce back from their recent disappointing performances, and also hailed the appointment of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as club captain.</p>

      <p>"I am happy for him (Aubameyang) for being appointed captain at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> ," Koscielny said. "I wish them the best, even though they are in a pretty tricky period.</p>
      <p>"But there you have it, it is these moments where you see a team, a collective, ready to fight together to climb back up the pole!"</p>
      <p>It has been reported that Koscielny sent Unai Emery a message of support when he was sacked as manager of Arsenal earlier this month, suggesting he still cares deeply about the club in spite of the way he left.</p>

      <p>He added: "I can understand why (Arsenal fans didn't understand him leaving). Nobody anticipated m Arsenal departure. To keep it simple, I was not as happy as I was on the first day I signed.</p>
      <p>And then with my family we needed to return home, to have a new challenge for us. To be able to become happy once again together, a return to France was the best solution."</p>
