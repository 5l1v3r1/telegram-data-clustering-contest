      <h1>Why can Russia still play in Euro 2020 despite World Cup 2022 ban?</h1>
      <h2>Russia have been handed a WADA ban ruling them out of the Tokyo Olympics and 2022 World Cup - but they will still be able to play in Euro 2020 next summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:11:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Russia has been banned from major international sporting events for four years after being found guilty of manipulating laboratory doping data.</p>
      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed the punishment in Lausanne after considering recommendations from its independent compliance review committee (CRC).</p>
      <p>The judgement means Russia will be banned from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Individual Russian athletes untainted by the scandal will able to compete independently under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>And despite being ruled out of the next World Cup, Russia will be clear to compete at Euro 2020 next summer, where Saint Petersburg will host three group games and a quarter-final.</p>

      <h3>Why can they play at Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>Russia will be free to take their place at Euro 2020 because the tournament is organised by UEFA.</p>
      <p>Despite being one of the world's biggest sporting events, European football's governing body does not fall under the definition of a Major Events Organisation under the international compliance code.</p>
      <p>As a result, it does not fall under the "major international sporting events" definition when punishments for doping violations are being enforced.</p>

      <h3>Will they still host games?</h3>
      <p>Yes, for the same reasons as above.</p>
      <p>They have been punished with a ban from hosting major sporting events, but UEFA does not fall under the criteria and therefore is exempt from the punishment.</p>
      <h3>Could they still play in the World Cup?</h3>
      <p>This is where it gets slightly complicated. The ban on the Russian flag and anthem means that individual athletes can compete as 'neutrals' in events such as the Olympics.</p>

      <p>But in a team sport, it is hard to see any way around the punishment to get the Russia football team to Qatar should they qualify.</p>
      <p>Any mechanism put in place would require WADA's control and approval and not feature the Russian flag or anthem.</p>
      <p>A successful appeal could also lead to them being allowed into the World Cup.</p>
      <h3>What happens next?</h3>
      <p>WADA said the decision was unanimous, but Russia's Anti Doping Agency (RUSADA) has 21 days to appeal against the ban.</p>
      <p>If it does so, the appeal will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p>

      <p>There's also the prospect of alternative arrangements being put into place by FIFA alongside WADA controls to allow Russian athletes to have some involvement without their flag or anthem.</p>
      <p>Players would need to prove they are not implicated in the doping scandal, and it remains to be seen if a solution could be found to allow them to compete.</p>
