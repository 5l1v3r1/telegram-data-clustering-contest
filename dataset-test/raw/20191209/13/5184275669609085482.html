      <p>While attending the 2019 Variety’s Hitmakers Brunch with her brother and collaborator Finneas O’Connell (FINNEAS) on Saturday, December 07, the 17-year-old singer was asked to comment on the backlash she faced after criticising the gown in a recent interview – something she says hasn’t fazed her.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t even know about it. I don’t even care. Why would I care? I don’t know. People try to frame me for being shady and I’m not even, so I don’t care. I’m just being honest, I’m not gonna lie!” Eilish said.</p>
      <p>The backlash came after the “Bad Guy” hitmaker said she used to watch the music awards show just to check out the women’s outfits. When Finneas mentioned Gaga’s meat dress, Eilish, who is a devout vegan, responded “yikes”.</p>
      <p>The moment soon went viral, with GaGa fans slamming Billie with the hashtag #BillieEilishisoverparty.</p>
