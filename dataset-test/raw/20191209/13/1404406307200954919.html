      <h1>VladTV's Biggest Interviews of 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:22:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:22</time> by <a rel="author">DJ Vlad</a></address>
      <p>2019 has been a major year for VladTV. With almost 200 interviews being filmed, the fight for the top spots was competitive.  We interviewed rappers, singers, athletes, actors, former criminals, real estate tycoons, as well as interesting people that don't have an easy classification.  </p>
      <p>The numbers are calculated by combining the Youtube views of all the clips, as well as the full interview numbers.  Certain entries like Omarion and Faizon Love were posted near the end of the year, so they probably would have been higher in the list if they were interviewed at the start of the year.  Another thing to note is that most of these interviews have 20 or more clips.  Certain interviews like DaBaby, which only has 8 clips, put them at somewhat of a disadvantage.  But overall, this is a good representation of all of the biggest performing interviews of 2019.</p>
