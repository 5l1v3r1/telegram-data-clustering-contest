      <p><b>Phnom Penh</b><b>:</b> More than 12,000 professional and amateur athletes on Sunday took part in the 24th Angkor Wat International Half Marathon at the complex of the famed Angkor Archeological Park in Cambodia’s Siem Reap province. Thong Khon, President of the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia (NOCC), said some 4,602 runners were foreigners from 85 countries and regions, and 7,573 were Cambodians.
