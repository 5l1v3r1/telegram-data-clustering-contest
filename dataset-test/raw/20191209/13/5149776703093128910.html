      <p>Christmas dinner is probably one of the most loved meals of the year.</p>
      <p>But when you add up the cost of the meat, all the trimmings and a sweet treat, it can also be an extremely expensive meal.</p>
      <p>So financial app Wagestream went on a hunt for all the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas dinner</a> essentials and where you can buy them cheapest.  </p>
      <p>They found a way to cook the meal for four people for less than £50, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/you-can-christmas-9961-including-21055554">MirrorOnline reports.</a></p>
      <p>Wagestream chief executive Peter Briffett said: "Christmas can be hugely stressful for many households, as there is massive pressure to deliver the perfect day for all the family.</p>
      <p>"We thought it would be nice to do some research to show that you don’t have to spend a fortune to have a great Christmas — and you don’t need to scrimp on the simple pleasures either."</p>
      <p>Christmas dinner comes with all the trimmings - from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/">sprouts and carrots to Chipolatas</a> and parsnips.</p>
      <p>In fact, the most expensive bit of the whole meal is the turkey, which costs £9.99 from Lidl.</p>
