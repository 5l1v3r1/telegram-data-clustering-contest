      <p>Police in central Israel have arrested an Arab man suspected of <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272867?fbclid=IwAR33eLNRBzlqLmwYyC-rVH2ZSq5x8LhQ3e2nZ13fV_W_G0qHKdlzRcpeFEo">assaulting a rabbi</a> in the city of Lod on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old suspect was arrested, questioned, then released to house arrest, after he allegedly dragged Rabbi Itamar Ben-Yaakov out of his car Sunday and beat him, following an apparent dispute in a parking lot in the city of Lod.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Ben-Yaakov, the rabbi of the Eshkol neighborhood in Lod, had driven to pick up his children from a daycare center, when he found his car blocked by an Arab woman who had exited her vehicle.</p>
      <p>After the woman refused to let him pass, Rabbi Ben-Yaakov called police, while the Arab woman called her relatives. Shortly thereafter, two Arab men approached Rabbi Ben-Yaakovâ€™s car, pulled him from the vehicle and knocked him to the ground and began to beat him.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Ben-Yaakov suffered light injuries during the attack.</p>
