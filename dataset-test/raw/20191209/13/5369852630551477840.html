      <p>LEINSTER HAVE RULED Jonathan Sexton out of this weekend’s return clash with Northampton Saints at the Aviva Stadium.</p>
      <p>Sexton suffered a knee injury early in the second half of Saturday’s thumping 16-43 win away to Northampton Saints and had to be helped from the field while his team-mates forced their fourth try of the day.</p>
      <p>The out-half was sent for a scan on the injury, the result of which will show the severity of the issue and determine how long Leinster must plan for his absence.</p>
      <p>Centre Joe Tomane is also set for a spell on the sidelines as he has aggravated his hamstring injury. He will miss out on the remaining three rounds of Champions Cup fixtures as the medical team have put a six to eight week timeframe for his recovery.</p>
      <p>James Ryan is among the doubts for Saturday against Northampton after he was taken off for a HIA in Franklin’s Gardens.</p>
      <p>In positive news, Sean Cronin is due to take a full part in training this week after working his way through a neck injury.</p>
      <p>Peter Dooley has also returned to a full programme after a knee knock away to Glasgow.</p>
