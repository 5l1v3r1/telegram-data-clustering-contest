      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Rhode Island agencies have proposed a new regulation on the sale of medical marijuana that would require out-of-state patients to present identification from their state as proof of residency.</p>
      <p>Last year, state lawmakers began allowing dispensaries to sell to out-of-state residents, and 6,500 people who were Rhode Island residents changed their patient card addresses to California, according to the Providence Journal.</p>
      <p>Many patients are looking to California because the patient-card rules there are more relaxed there than they are in Rhode Island, the paper reported.</p>
      <p>"(The California card) was easier to afford. ... I make no money and have a lot of medical bills to pay," user Alexa Coffey said.</p>
      <p>Critics of the proposal for out-of-state patients to provide ID say Rhode Island's rules are already very complicated. They worry this could push patients to purchase off the black market or in Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>"We need to stop making people jump through hoops," Greenleaf Compassion Center retail manager Jeff Pietrefesa said.</p>
      <p>The Department of Business Regulation will accept public comment through Dec. 21.</p>
