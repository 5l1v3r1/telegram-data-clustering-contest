      <h1>Gary Lineker tweets warning to Liverpool but clarifies title comments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:13:27+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>It seems Leicester City may be genuine rivals this season.</p>
      <p>They’re on a brilliant run and should be respected for not only their recent performances but a points tally that could be leading the table if it wasn’t for Liverpool!</p>
      <p>During Leicester’s thrashing of Aston Villa at the weekend, Gary Lineker warned Liverpool that his side were ‘on our tail,’ before later clarifying that he’d only believe Leicester had a genuine title shot if it wasn’t for the brilliance of Jurgen Klopp’s Reds…</p>
      <blockquote>Watch out <a href="https://twitter.com/LFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LFC</a>, The Foxes are on your tail.<br/>— Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1203687035795648512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>If Liverpool weren’t so relentlessly good, I’d fancy that this Leicester team could actually win this league. What a time to be alive. 👏🏻👏🏻<br/>— Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1203703386966822912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>So, are we worried about Brendan Rodgers’ side? Not worried, but aware. They deserve to be where they are. They’re a very good team – but any result happens in 11 days’ time when they face Manchester City is essentially good news for us.</p>
      <p>Our job is to travel to the King Power on Boxing Day and get three points, or at worst – a draw.</p>
      <p>Before then, we face Rb Salzburg, Watford, two games in the Club World Cup and Aston Villa in the EFL Cup – although a youth team will play and not Klopp’s regular XI.</p>
