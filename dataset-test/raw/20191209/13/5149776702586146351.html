      <p>A new streaming platform has launched in the UK that is set to rival the likes of Netflix, Sky and Amazon Prime.</p>
      <p>However unlike other binge-worthy services, the service is completely free-to-use.</p>
      <p>Plex offers thousands of films, TV shows and web series to stream without charge, says <a href="https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/new-rival-netflix-launches-offering-3622242">GrimsbyLive</a> .</p>
      <p>Titles such as Zulu, Rain Man, Raging Bull, Lord of War, The Terminator, Apocalypse Now and Thelma and Louise are available to watch now.</p>
      <p>But Plex says <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/1214032/Sky-TV-Netflix-vs-Plex-Free-To-Watch-Streaming-Service">it will continue to add new content</a> on top of its current library of thousands of Hollywood blockbusters, TV shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, Bollywood musicals and more.</p>

      <p>Plex has teamed up with Warner Bros to offer the service - which includes adverts - and has just launched.</p>
      <p>All you need to view any of the content is a Plex account, which is free to set-up.</p>
      <p>Plexâ€™s library includes content from the major Hollywood studios, including MGM, Lionsgate, Legendary and Warner Bros.</p>
      <p>Until now, Plex had been a media library service designed to help you keep your own video content organised and available to stream on any of your devices.</p>
      <p>Plex CEO Keith Valory, said: "Plex was born out of a passion for media and entertainment, and offering free ad-supported premium movies and TV shows is just the latest step in our mission to bring all your favorite content together in one place.</p>
      <p>"What started more than a decade ago as a passion project to make accessing media on connected devices easier has evolved into the most comprehensive streaming platform in the industry, used by millions of people around the world."</p>
      <p>Plex is available to download for free on iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Android TV, Fire TV, macOS, Windows and other platforms.</p>
