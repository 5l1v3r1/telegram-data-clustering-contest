      <h1>Bobby Duncan agent Saif Rubie banned and fined for his ‘conduct on Twitter’</h1>

      <p>The Saif Rubie saga seems like it happened a very long time ago, doesn’t it?</p>
      <p>But it was actually just a few months back at the end of the summer.</p>
      <p>For those who don’t remember, the agent of then Liverpool striker Bobby Duncan went public on Twitter in order to force us to offload his client to Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesPearceLFC/status/1204022800002043904">accused the club</a> of “mentally bullying and destroying the life” of the teenager in an extraordinary rant which earned him the<a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/08/28/carragher-hits-out-at-bobby-duncans-agent-as-storm-involving-the-striker-unfolds/"> wrath of Jamie Carragher.</a></p>
      <p>Today, James Pearce confirmed Rubie has banned from working as an agent for six weeks and fined £10,000.</p>
      <blockquote>Saif Rubie, the agent of former <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LFC</a> Academy striker Bobby Duncan, banned from acting as an intermediary for six weeks and fined £10,000 by the FA for his conduct on Twitter back in September. <a href="https://t.co/IclZswwpyW">pic.twitter.com/IclZswwpyW<br/></a>— James Pearce (@JamesPearceLFC) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesPearceLFC/status/1204018508343984128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>This seems pretty lenient considering his absurd actions, but we’re glad he hasn’t got away with weaponising mental health completely.</p>
      <p>Since joining Fiorentina in the summer, Duncan has not played a minute of first-team football and has instead been competing in the Primavera 1 for his club’s U19s.</p>
      <p>They haven’t won a match since September.</p>
