      <h1>North Korea warns ‘erratic old man’ Trump that it has ‘nothing more to lose’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:30:53+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>North Korea released a statement warning President Trump that it has “nothing more to lose” after he condemned its <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/north-korea-conducts-missile-test-a-day-after-announcing-weekend-talks-with-us"><u>recent missile tests</u></a>.</p>
      <p>Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had worked toward a denuclearization agreement, where the United States would provide sanctions relief in return for North Korea to turn over its nuclear weapons. North Korea’s economy has been shut out of the global economy by U.S. sanctions, leaving the people in desperate poverty.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-kim-jong-un-as-has-far-too-much-to-lose-to-act-in-a-hostile-way"><u>Trump responded to reports</u></a> that North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations said that denuclearization was off the table.</p>
      <p>“Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way. He signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement with me in Singapore,” Trump tweeted. “He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November. North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has tremendous economic potential, but it must denuclearize as promised. NATO, China, Russia, Japan, and the entire world is unified on this issue!”</p>
      <p>North Korea responded early Monday morning by condemning Trump and claiming that the country has “nothing more to lose.”</p>
      <p>“Such language is, indeed, disappointing. This naturally indicates that Trump is an old man bereft of patients,” the hermit nation wrote. “From those words and expressions, we can read how irritated he is now. As he is such a heedless and erratic old man, the time when we can not but <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/war-of-the-words-north-korea-threatens-to-start-calling-trump-dotard-again"><u>call him a ‘dotard’</u></a> may come again.”</p>
      <p>They added, “Trump has too many things that he does not know about the DPRK. We have nothing more to lose.”</p>
      <p>North Korea said its future actions would be a “surprise to Trump” and claimed the rest of the world would be left to “watch with anxiety” as the threats continue to elevate.</p>

      <p>Trump and Kim have had a rocky relationship, despite continuous negotiations. The White House has had some achievements in their dialogue with North Korea, such as the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/north-korea-to-release-3-american-prisoners-in-good-faith-gesture-for-trump-summit">return of U.S. prisoners</a>, but they have had little success reigning in North Korea's missile tests or denuclearizing the peninsula.</p>
