      <p><b>LONDON —</b> Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he has never doubted the quality of midfielder Naby Keita despite the Guinea international's limited impact since his arrival at Anfield last year.<br/><br/>Keita has been confined to a bit-part role since his £52.75 million ($69 million) move from RB Leipzig in July 2018 and before Saturday had played just 14 minutes of Premier League football this season.<br/><br/>But the 24-year-old, whose Anfield career has been disrupted by injuries, gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday's 3-0 win at Bournemouth.<br/><br/>Klopp, who has reassured Keita about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.<br/><br/>"Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?," said Klopp.<br/><br/>"We are not flying, it's not like we won all of the games 4-0, or 5-0, so we had to bring on a player who helps us with defending set-pieces.<br/><br/>"Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, 'why don't I play?' I get all that. So we stayed in contact, we talked and we spoke a lot about it."<br/><br/>Klopp said he never questioned the player's quality.<br/><br/>"It was just unlucky and in life you need luck always," he said. "He started (his Liverpool career) really well – everybody forgot that – then got injured. And again we had two really good seasons."<br/><br/>Liverpool last lost a league game in early January but despite an eight-point lead over second-placed Leicester, Klopp is not getting carried away.<br/><br/>"I don't know if it's so special because we don't think about it," he said of the unbeaten run.<br/><br/>"We get confronted with our winning streak always after the game, that's the only moment. From that moment on, nobody thinks about it."<br/><br/>Klopp believes resting and rotating his players will be key to successfully negotiating a hectic December schedule, during which they are competing in multiple competitions.<br/><br/>"It was wonderful – maybe the best thing of the (Bournemouth) game – we didn't have to use Sadio Mane," said the German boss, whose team must avoid defeat against Salzburg on Tuesday to guarantee reaching the Champions League knockout stages." — AFP</p>
