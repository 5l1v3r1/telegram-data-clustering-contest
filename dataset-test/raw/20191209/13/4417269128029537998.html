      <p>The residents receive 24 hours holistic care in a safe and secure environment. As part of their care, they also receive nutritional meals, medical management and participate in stimulation programmes.</p>
      <blockquote>Jona Vaughan home manager, Fiona Anderson explained that with the escalating costs and high care needs of their residents it is a challenge to cater to all their needs and said, “On behalf of Durban and Coastal Mental Health, the Parents Association, the residents and staff we wish to thank the caring community of Amanzimtoti, especially the members of the local churches, schools and businesses, and a departmental store for their generosity, kindness and support during this festive season.”</blockquote>
