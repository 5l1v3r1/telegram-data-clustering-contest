      <h1>Jack Ross identifies where Hibs could strengthen ahead of January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Hibees are well stocked for attacking midfielders but could do with more defensive types.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:07:40+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> may look to increase his defensive midfield options during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> boss isn’t planning on being overly busy in the transfer market and hopes the performances of the players currently in the building mean it’s just a case of filling gaps in the squad.</p>
      <p>One area that may require attention is the middle of the park however, with the Hibees lacking natural holding midfielders since Marvin Bartley and Mark Milligan departed in the summer.</p>
      <p>Josh Vela’s arrival under Paul Heckingbottom was meant to address that issue to an extent, but the former Bolton man hasn’t been quoted in any of Ross’ squads since he took control last month.</p>
      <p>Swede Melker Hallberg has filled the role against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> at the weekend in an otherwise attacking midfield that included Scott Allan, Martin Boyle and Stevie Mallan.</p>
      <p>But a specialist could be on the New Year shopping list to give his side more balance.</p>

      <p>“Our team selection on Saturday was pretty bold because even with Melker in the middle of the park, he’s not a natural sitting midfield player,” Ross explained. “He’s having to learn his trade in that respect.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a lot of forward thinking players within the group but when it clicks, it’s good.</p>
      <p>“He’s got the capabilities to play there. He’s still a young man and another that I’ve been really impressed with. He’s a good player.</p>
      <p>“He’s intelligent and wants to learn the position. I spoke with him individually and showed him some things. He took them on board on Saturday and did the job really well.</p>
      <p>“He fatigued a bit because he missed pre-season.</p>
      <p>“At the moment he’s doing that role and I’ve been pleased with him in it.</p>
      <p>"It’s just the depth in that position because we don’t have many of those types within the squad.”</p>
