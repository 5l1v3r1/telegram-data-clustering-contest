      <p>Newcastle United youngster Kell Watts has returned to the club following a loan deal from Stevenage.</p>
      <p>But the 20-year-old is expected to return to the EFL club in the new year.</p>
      <p>Watts has picked up a knee injury while on loan with Mark Sampson's League Two side and has returned to Tyneside for treatment for the rest of the month.</p>
      <p>United have been quietly impressed with Watts' loan stint so far with the defender playing in 20 matches this term in the EFL's basement division.</p>
      <p>Watts recently signed a three-year deal with the Magpies to commit his future to the club.</p>
      <p>The Alnwick-born player was one of the stars of the season for United in the Under-23s last season as they reached two finals and the latter stages of the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>Watts also made his debut for the first team in pre-season in the Premier League Asia Trophy game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in Nanjing.</p>
