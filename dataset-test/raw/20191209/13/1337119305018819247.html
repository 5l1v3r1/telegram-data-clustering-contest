      <h1>2K launches new studio focused on the next BioShock</h1>
      <h2>But it’s a long way off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:40:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster" target="_blank">Andrew Webster</a></address>
      <p><i>BioShock</i> is coming back. Today, publisher 2K announced the formation of a new studio called Cloud Chamber, which is already working on “the next iteration” of <i>BioShock</i>. It’ll be the first new entry in the series since <i>BioShock Infinite</i> in 2013 — though it sounds like it’ll be a while before we see the new game. 2K says the title “will be in development for the next several years,” making it a prime candidate for next-generation consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox’s Project Scarlett.</p>
      <p>Cloud Chamber will consist of two teams — one on San Francisco, the other in Montreal — and is being led by industry veteran Kelley Gilmore. “We founded Cloud Chamber to create yet-to-be-discovered worlds — and their stories within — that push the boundaries of what is possible in the video game medium,” Gilmore said in a statement. “Our team believes in the beauty and strength of diversity, in both the makeup of the studio and the nature of its thinking. We are a deeply experienced group of game makers, including many responsible for <i>BioShock</i>’s principal creation, advancement and longstanding notoriety, and honored to be part of the 2K family as stewards of this iconic franchise.”</p>
      <p>Back in 2014, Irrational Games — the studio responsible for the <i>BioShock</i> franchise — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5422846/bioshock-studio-irrational-games-closing">abruptly closed down</a>, while co-founder Ken Levine relaunched the studio in a smaller form <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/23/14719810/bioshock-studio-irrational-games-renamed-ghost-story">under the name Ghost Story</a>. The new studio has yet to release or announce a title.</p>
