      <h1>Dietitians Say to Meal Prep These 3 Plant-Based Proteins on Sunday to Lose Weight All Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:05:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Sugar</a></address>
      <p>After enjoying your weekend chilling or being adventurous (or a little of both!), it's time to get ready for your healthy week ahead, and that means it's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Meal-Prep-Tips-Weight-Loss-42606596">meal prep time</a>! If you're not into making complete meals, registered dietitian Rachel Stahl, MS, CDN, CDE, of <a href="https://www.resnutrition.com/">Rachel Stahl Nutrition</a> says to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/What-Food-Prep-46569553">food prep</a> a few plant-based protein sources so you can add them to meals throughout the week.</p>
      <p>Protein is key if you want to feel satiated at meals to prevent overeating and to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Does-Eating-More-Protein-Help-Weight-Loss-45128752">help with weight-loss goals</a>, and it also helps build muscle. If you don't have a ton of time to meal prep, these are the top three plant-based protein sources you should make.</p>
      <h3>Tofu</h3>

      <p>"I recommend clients cut tofu into slices or cubes and bake," Rachel said. Store cooled baked tofu in the fridge so you can easily add a serving to salads, stir-fries, and lettuce wraps or burritos for the week.</p>
      <p>You can even make a couple batches of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/34429412/image/34437127/When-saut%C3%A9ing-baking-you-may-prefer-thinner-rectangular-slices">tofu that are marinated with different flavors</a> to give more variety to your meals. Prepping <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Tofu-Scramble-Kale-Sweet-Potatoes-35566619">scrambled tofu</a> is also a great option for busy mornings or quick dinners.</p>
      <h3>Beans and Lentils</h3>

      <p>"Beans and lentils contain fiber, which helps with weight management. All are packed with protein, which aids in satiety," Rachel said. Cooking beans from scratch may take a lot more time than using canned beans, but it's cheaper and the flavor and texture is way better. You also have more variety than just your basic black beans or chickpeas.</p>
      <p>You can presoak your beans overnight to speed up the cooking process, and then simmer them on the stove for about two hours (time depends on the type of beans and how soft you like them). You can also <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Cook-Beans-Slow-Cooker-40544658">cook dry beans in your slow cooker</a>.</p>
      <p>If you don't have hours to spend cooking beans, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/46911419/image/46912394/Grains">lentils</a> are another great protein option since they only take about 20 minutes to cook.</p>
      <p>Add cooked beans and lentils to burritos, soups, or <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/46881965/image/46881966/Add-Beans-to-Smoothies">smoothies</a>, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/High-Protein-Overnight-Oats-Recipe-40949204">mash them into overnight oats</a> or <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Mashed-Potatoes-White-Beans-39113299">potatoes</a>, or use them in grain bowls tossed with rice or quinoa for an extra fiber and protein boost. If you're prepping chickpeas, you can also <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Marinated-Chickpeas-41256197">marinate</a> or <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Buddha-Bowl-Meal-Prep-45452092">roast them</a> to add to fresh salads.</p>
      <p>Of course to save time Rachel said you can buy canned beans, just make sure to choose low-sodium beans. Drain and rinse a few varieties and keep them in the fridge so you can quickly grab them to add to meals.</p>
      <h3>Whole Grains</h3>
