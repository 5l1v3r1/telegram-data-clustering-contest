      <h2>Freddie Ljungberg's Arsenal travel to London rivals West Ham in the Premier League on Monday Night Football hoping to end a run of nine games without a win and avoid getting sucked into a relegation battle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:30:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Bliss</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal will be hoping to bounce back from their shock home defeat to Brighton last week with an away win against their local rivals, as the Gunners travel to the London Stadium to take on a struggling West Ham side.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg could ring the changes after defeat against the Seagulls last week, with the likes of Calum Chambers, Keiran Tierney, Matteo Guendouzi and Nicolas Pepe all pushing for a recall to the starting lineup.</p>
      <p>For the Hammers, Jack Wilshere is fit to face his former club, but doubts remain over the fitness of star striker Sebastian Haller, with Michail Antonio in line to replace him.</p>
      <p>So, what lineup with Ljungberg go with against the Seagulls?</p>
      <p>And, what will the final score be at the London Stadium?</p>
      <p>We used FIFA 20 to simulate the outcome of West Ham vs Arsenal to get a score prediction, just for a bit of fun.</p>
      <h4>West Ham vs Arsenal score predicted using FIFA 20</h4>
      <p>To set up this simulation, we used kick-off mode within FIFA 20 but didn't select a team to control; we then selected the teams and watched the match play out by itself, to give us a unique prediction.</p>
      <p>The AI difficulty was set to world class, with the line-up updated with the latest transfers, injuries and suspensions.</p>
      <p>We predict that <b>West Ham</b> could set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with the line-up as follows: <b>Martin; Fredericks, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Rice, Noble; Fornals, Felipe Anderson, Yarmolenko, Antonio.</b></p>

      <p>We predict that <b>Arsenal</b> could set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with the line-up as follows:<b> Leno; Bellerin, Chambers, David Luiz, Tierney; Torreira, Xhaka; Pepe, Ozil, Aubameyang; Lacazette.</b></p>

      <p>Despite Arsenal's recent away record being poor, the Gunners started this game very well and looked much the better side in the opening stages.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette should have opened the scoring just ten minutes in, after connecting with a cross from Hector Bellerin from the right, but his header went agonisingly wide of the post.</p>

      <p>Manuel Pellegrini's side were pegged back in their own half and were struggling to get any kind of rhythm in this game, such was Arsenal's commanding start.</p>
      <p>And with 26 minutes on the clock, who else but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put Arsenal into a deserved lead.</p>
      <p>The Gabonese striker had the ball played into his feet by Lacazette inside the area, who then turned and bent the ball around Ogbonna and past David Martin into the right hand side of the goal.</p>

      <p>A great finish by the Arsenal captain.</p>

      <p>Nicolas Pepe, Granit Xhaka and Aubameyang all had efforts on goal following the opening strike, but they didn't do enough to trouble Martin considering their dominance.</p>
      <p>In the second-half, Wilshere was brought on for the Hammers, to try and get a foothold in proceedings. but it didn't work.</p>
      <p>Arsenal continued to dominate and finally doubled their lead in the 63rd minute, with Aubameyang turning provider, sending a brilliant cross to the back post where Hector Bellerin was there unmarked to tap home from close range.</p>

      <p>Finally some daylight for Ljungberg's side.</p>

      <p>Substitute Bukayo Saka, on for Aubameyang, almost put the icing on the cake in the dying moments, but Martin was equal to his near post effort.</p>

      <p>And that was that, another disappointing performance for the Hammers, but Arsenal get back to winning ways.</p>

      <p>Despite a poor team performance, Declan Rice stood out as West Ham's best player, who put in a great shift and showed his commitment to the cause.</p>

      <p>For Arsenal, Hector Bellerin was fantastic at right-back, and he topped it off with a goal.</p>
