      <p>Huawei has announced that it will be shipping more devices next year powered by its Android alternative, HarmonyOS. The firm said that products will not be limited to China, but will also come to stores around the world. One such product that could be included in the product line-up includes the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-huawei-vision-is-a-4k-quantum-dot-smart-tv-running-harmonyos">previously announced</a> Huawei Vision, a 4K Quantum Dot smart TV.</p>
      <p>While HarmonyOS was <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/huawei-announces-harmonyos-made-for-smart-devices-smartphones-and-more">touted as a rival</a> to Android, the Chinese firm isn’t planning to bring HarmonyOS to Android’s biggest domain – smartphones &amp; tablets – just yet. Rather than jump right into the smartphone market, the firm plans to roll out its OS to more peripheral tech such as smartwatches, speakers, virtual reality technology, and TVs.</p>
      <p>The comments that were cited by Reuters were made by the president of the Huawei consumer business group’s software division, Wang Chenglu. He re-iterated the fact that the firm did not want to drop Android from its phones. The firm likely wants to stick with Android because it’ll be more appealing to customers, with that said, the firm does plan to include support for Android apps on HarmonyOS sometime in the future.</p>
