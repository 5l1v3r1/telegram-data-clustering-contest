      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> have been left confused as Arthur Thomas continued to bully Archie Breckle in front of their parents Laurel and Jai.</p>
      <p>Fans of the show know that for weeks Arthur has been terrorising Jai's son Archie, who came to live with his dad after the sudden death of his mother Rachel.</p>
      <p>Jealous of the attention Archie was getting, Arthur started being horrible to him and at one point even <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-horrified-as-arthur-punches-archie-unconscious-and-blames-jimmy/">knocked him unconscious after punching him</a>.</p>

      <p>And in Friday night's episode (December 6, 2019) Arthur was unimpressed to learn his mum Laurel had invited her boyfriend Jai and Archie over for Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Laurel devised a plan to show Arthur how much fun they could all have at Christmas by making mince pies together.</p>
      <p>When Arthur returned from school, Laurel and Jai were stood at the counter whilst Archie was at the table helping.</p>
      <p>She asked her son if he would get the mincemeat out of the cupboard but Archie called out "I'll get it."</p>

      <p>As boys leaned down to the cupboard, Arthur hissed: "She asked me."</p>
      <aside>Surely they would have heard Arthur?</aside>
      <p>Although they were stood just inches away from the kids, the couple continued to talk about Christmas and how they think they've made a pretty good start getting through to Arthur.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Arthur was still tormenting Archie saying: "If you're coming for christmas, you do exactly what I tell you to do, or you'll be in trouble."</p>
      <p>Viewers noticed Jai and Laurel were completely oblivious to how Arthur treated Archie.</p>
