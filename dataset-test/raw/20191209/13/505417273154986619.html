      <h1>Russia Have Been Banned From 2020 Olympic Games &amp; 2022 World Cup</h1>

        <b>The World Anti-Doping Agency has banned Russia from global sporting events meaning they will not be eligible to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics or the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The decision comes after WADA accused Moscow of falsifying data from an anti-doping laboratory.</p>
      <p>“The full list of recommendations have been unanimously accepted,” said WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald, via<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/09/wada-bans-russia-from-olympics-over-doping-scandals/"> the New York Post</a>.</p>
      <p>“WADA’s executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years.”</p>

      <p>Russian athletes will still be allowed to compete at the Tokyo Olympics next year as neutrals. However, they will need to demonstrate that they were not part of any state-sponsored system of doping which is what Wada believes has happened in Russia.</p>
      <p>They will also still be able to compete at <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/ireland-euro-2020-playoff/">Euro 2020</a>, despite the ban with St Petersburg being one of the 12 host cities.</p>
      <p>“They are going to have prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation,” Fitzgerald said.</p>
