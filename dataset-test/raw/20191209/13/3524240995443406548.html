      <p>American rapper, Kanye West, on Sunday covered himself in silver paint for his opera performance, Mary, which he showed in Miami.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old rapper was spotted wearing a baggy silver outfit with silver face paint covering his entire head and hands, reports <i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7770611/Kanye-West-dons-silver-body-paint-matching-bizarre-baggy-outfit-new-opera-Mary-Miami.html">Daily Mail.</a></i></p>
      <p>The Mary opera was performed on a large barge outside of the Miami Marine Stadium.</p>
      <p>West took to Twitter on Thursday for a rare tweet where he promoted the opera, which was directed by Nicole Beecroft with music by the Sunday Service choir.</p>
      <p>The tweet also included a bible verse Luke 1:30-31, which read, ‘And the angel said unto her, fear not, Mary: For thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus.’</p>
      <p>Mary is his second opera, following his debut Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
