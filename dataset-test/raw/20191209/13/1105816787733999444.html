      <p><b>QUETTA: </b>Four women, who were arrested from Balochistan’s Awaran district last month, have been released and returned home, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) chief Akhtar Mengal said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mengal and Sanaullah Baloch, a member of Balochistan Assembly, took to Twitter to announce their return.</p>

      <p>The BNP-M chief had warned that his party would pull out of its alliance with the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) if the women were not released.</p>

      <p>“This wouldn’t be for the first time for us to quit the ruling alliance. We will not compromise when it comes to our dignity,” Mengal said while delivering a fiery speech in the National Assembly last week.</p>
      <p>“Dictators have failed in the past when they tried to run Balochistan at gunpoint and the present government won’t be able to do either,” he added.</p>
      <p>BNP-M lawmakers and MNAs from tribal districts then staged a token sit-in in front of speaker’s dais and staged a walkout from the House.</p>
      <p>The deputy speaker, who was chairing the session, summoned the interior minister to the assembly to explain why the women were arrested.</p>
