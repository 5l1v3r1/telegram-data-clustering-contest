      <h1>Microsoft will shut down to-do app Wunderlist on May 6th</h1>
      <h2>It hopes users will make the leap to its own To Do service.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:35:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/kris-holt" target="_blank">Kris Holt</a></address>
      <p>Over two and a half years after Microsoft said it'd one day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/20/microsoft-is-replacing-wunderlist-with-a-new-to-do-app/">kill to-do service Wunderlist</a> in favor of its own To Do app, it has <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/join-us-on-our-new-journey/">revealed</a> when it'll drop the ax: May 6th. After that time, Wunderlist's to-do lists won't sync anymore and you'll have a limited time to export lists from there into To Do. As of today, Microsoft won't accept any more sign-ups for Wunderlist.</p>
      <p>Microsoft bought <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/01/microsoft-buys-wunderlist-creator/">Wunderlist creator 6Wunderkinder</a> in 2015 and announced To Do (or To-Do, as it was known then) in April 2017. It launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/microsoft-to-do-redesign/">redesigned version of To Do</a> in September, which brought the service closer in line with Wunderlist's feature set while deepening its integration with several Microsoft services, including Outlook, Microsoft Planner and Cortana.</p>
      <p>The plan to put Wunderlist out to pasture has been in the works for a long time. Despite founder Christian Reber's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/08/wunderlist-creator-wants-to-buy-app-from-microsoft/">offer to buy back the service</a>, it'll wind down in less than five months.</p>
