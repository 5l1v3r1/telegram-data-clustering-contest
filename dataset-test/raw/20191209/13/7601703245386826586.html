      <h1>Prabhas To Shelve Jaan And Announce A New Movie? Shocking Rumour Goes Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:11:29+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.filmibeat.com/authors/roktim-rajpal.html" target="_blank">Roktim Rajpal</a></address>
      <p>A few months ago, Prabhas received a big shock when the much-hyped Saaho underperformed in the Telugu states, failing to impress most movie buffs. Post the debacle, 'Darling' took a break from work and put his film with director Radha Krishna Kumar, being referred to as 'Jaan', on hold. Recently, a website claimed that he was not interested in resuming the flick and this ruffled a few feathers. Now, here is some more disturbing news for 'die-hard fans'. According to Cinejosh, Prabhas's well-wishers have asked him to scrap the Hindi-Telugu bilingual and take up a new project.</p>

      <p>Like Saaho, 'Jaan' too is being shot against an impressive budget and has a pan-India plot. However, unlike the Sujeeth movie, it does not feature mass elements, which makes it a riskier venture than expected.</p>
      <p>In case, you did not know, it stars Pooja Hegde as the leading lady and marks her first collaboration with Prabhas. The Tulu lady will be seen in a glam avatar in 'Jaan', which might make young hearts skip a beat. A while ago, she had said the movie will be a unique experience for cinegoers.</p>
      <p>"We have finished two schedules and looking forward to shoot the rest. It is going to be something that the audience has never seen before I feel, because we are doing a European period film," she had told a top website.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, she'll be disappointed if 'Jaan' gets scrapped.</p>
      <p>Coming back to Prabhas, he might soon be teaming up with ace director Koratala Siva for a mass movie, backed by Ram Charan. The grapevine also suggests, Geetha Govindam fame Parasuram is keen on teaming up with the 'Rebel Star'.</p>
      <p>The rumour mills also indicate that there is an outside chance of him teaming up with KGF director Prashanth Neel in the near future.</p>
      <p>So, should Prabhas go ahead with 'Jaan'? Comments, please!</p>
