      <h1>realme Buds Air Revealed; Supports BlueTooth 5.0 And Instant Pairing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:50:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>As we’ve previously reported last week, realme had announced of <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/200696/realme-expand-beyond-phones-to-wearables-true-wireless-headsets/">expanding its product range</a> to include devices such as wearables and true wireless audio. Debuting soon in Indian markets, the company revealed its first ever true wireless earbuds, the realme Buds Air</p>
      <p>At first glance, the realme Buds Air sports a design that’s somewhat similar to Apple Airpods and Huawei Freebuds. According to the official website, the true wireless earbuds is available in three colour choices: Black, Yellow, and White.</p>

      <p>Hardware-wise, the earbuds supports instant pairing via Bluetooth 5.0 which allows it to automatically connect to your smart device once you open its charging case – provided that you’ve already paired both devices prior to this, of course. Other than that, the Buds Air also features a 12mm bass boost driver in each earbud, touch controls for music and hands-free calls, and one-touch activation for Google Assistant. realme has not disclosed any information on its battery life, or other features and specifications.</p>

      <p>The Buds Air will be launched alongside the brand’s new realme XT 730G smartphone on 17 December in India. realme has yet to reveal the true wireless earbuds’ pricing, and has not confirmed any plans for a global release at this time.</p>
