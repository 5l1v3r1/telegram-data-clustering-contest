      <h2>Man Utd right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka has impressed since arriving in the summer but Darren Fletcher wants to see him improve in one area.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:27:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Duncker, https://www.facebook.com/CharlotteDunckerMEN/</a></address>
      <p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka has been so good in Manchester United training that no player has been able to get past him, Darren Fletcher has revealed.</p>
      <p>The full-back has impressed since his move from Crystal Palace in the summer and has nailed down his place in <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's</a> starting XI and he's clearly been making an impact in training as well as in games.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> midfielder Fletcher revealed he had been talking to some of the current crop about the England international.</p>
      <p>“I was talking to some Manchester United players, and they were saying that no player has managed to pass <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/aaron-wan-bissaka">Wan-Bissaka</a> in training this season," Fletcher told Norway’s <a href="https://www.tv2.no/sport/11052345/">TV2</a> .</p>
      <p>“It’s as if he refuses to let them pass. He has to get better technically, but he is a fantastic full-back. When he gets better technically, he’s going to take his game to a new level. He is a fantastic defensive player and contributor for Manchester United.”</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been a regular starter for Solskjaer since his arrival in the summer, only missing two league games through illness, but Fletcher has pointed out where he wants the defender to improve.</p>
      <p>"He loves to defend himself," Fletcher said. "It’s refreshing to see, but he has to get better with the ball. Hopefully he is working on receiving and passing in training. I don’t see for myself that he’s going to be an attacking fullback who storms ahead."</p>
      <p>The full back impressed against Manchester City in the derby win at the Etihad and former Arsenal defender Martin Keown was full of praise for the United defender.</p>
      <p>"[One-on-one defending] is something I was good at myself," Keown told the BBC. ‘This guy is ahead of me and people thought I was good. ‘He can go in either direction and he’s got that arrogance to feel he can say ‘come on, take me on’."</p>
