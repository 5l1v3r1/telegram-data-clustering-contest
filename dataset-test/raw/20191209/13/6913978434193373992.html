      <p><b>MADRID —</b> Real Betis captain Joaquin became the oldest player to score a La Liga hat-trick after he inspired his team to beat Athletic Bilbao 3-2 on Sunday.<br/><br/>At 38 years and 140 days old, Joaquin hit his first ever hat-trick and surpassed Real Madrid great Alfredo Di Stefano, whose record as the oldest scorer of one in La Liga had stood for 55 years.<br/><br/>Joaquin also became only the seventh player in the league's history to score a hat-trick in the first 20 minutes of a match, after he found the net in the second, 11th and 20th minutes at the Benito Villamarin.<br/><br/>"I will remember this day for the rest of my life," said Joaquin, in a celebratory video message posted on Instagram.<br/><br/>Betis almost surrendered their advantage but held on for the win after Inaki Williams had converted a penalty and then Yuri Berchiche added a second for Bilbao with 15 minutes left.<br/><br/>Joaquin, who has 51 caps for Spain, began his professional career at Betis and made an emotional return to the club in 2015, after spells at Valencia, Malaga and Fiorentina.<br/><br/>In total, he now has 72 goals in 533 La Liga appearances.<br/><br/>The forward's latest match-winning contribution helped Betis climb to 11th in the table after a third consecutive victory.<br/><br/>Their local rivals Sevilla, meanwhile, lost ground at the top as they could only manage a 1-1 draw away at newly-promoted Osasuna.<br/><br/>Munir El Haddadi curled in a brilliant opener for Sevilla in the 11th minute but they were unable to find a winner after Ezequiel Avila equalized for Osasuna on the stroke of half-time.<br/><br/>The draw means Sevilla stay third, three points behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, who play a game in hand against each other on December 18. — AFP</p>
