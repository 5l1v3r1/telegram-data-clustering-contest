      <h1>Bitcoin Price Fills $7.5K Futures ‘Gap’ as Trader Weighs $8K Potential</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:39:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) fluctuated around $7,500 on Dec. 9 after a weekend of range-bound movement reduced volatility concerns for traders.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin delivers classic futures “bounce”</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/markets">Cointelegraph Markets</a> showed the largest <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a> trading in a $250 corridor since Friday, marking local highs of $7,604 before briefly reversing to $7,395 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Since then, the $7,500 boundary has acted as a centerpiece for Bitcoin, which comfortably filled the latest “gap” in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-futures">futures</a> markets once again as the week began.</p>
      <p>An increasingly common feature, futures gap-filling refers to BTC/USD targeting a zone between when futures finished trading in one session and resumed during the next. On Friday, <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin.html">CME futures</a> closed at $7,460, opening again at $7,570.</p>

      </p>
      <p>For regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a>, the predictable behavior was a source a positivity, despite Bitcoin overall remaining skittish within its current corridor.</p>
      <p>“Looks like we got a bit of a bounce off the cme gap which was nice,” he told subscribers of his dedicated Telegram channel on Monday.</p>
      <p>For fellow contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a>, conditions were similarly choppy. Uploading a <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1204017352536416256">new chart</a> to Twitter, he said upside potential hinged on BTC/USD preserving ground at $7,400.</p>
      <p>“Boring, range-bound movements here,” he summarized in accompanying comments. Van de Poppe continued:</p>
      <blockquote>“However, if $BTC breaks the red zone around $7,550, I won't be surprised with a move towards $7,800 and notably $8,000-8,200 zone. Crucial; holding $7,400 area as support.”</blockquote>
      <p>Zooming out from the short term, however, others were more bearish. In his weekly analysis for Cointelegraph, well-known pundit <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/keith-wareing">Keith Wareing</a> warned that over the coming months, the potential for Bitcoin to drop <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sorry-but-bitcoin-can-still-drop-to-27k-while-everyones-bullish">as low as $2,500</a> remained.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins stay stable as volatility ebbs</h3>
      <p>The start of the week produced similar behavior to Bitcoin across <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">altcoin</a> markets. The top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap avoided significant gains or losses, moving mostly by less than 1%.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin, traded down 0.7% at just above $150, that level having nonetheless failed to act as support in the past.</p>

      <p>The exception to the trend was Algorand (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/algorand-algo">ALGO</a>), which gained 6% on the back of a new <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-copyright-authority-and-algorand-develop-blockchain-ecosystem-for-copyright-management">implementation agreement</a> with Italy.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $203.4 billion, with Bitcoin’s share at 66.8% of the total.</p>
