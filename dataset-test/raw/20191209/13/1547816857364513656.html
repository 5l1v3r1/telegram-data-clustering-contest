      <p>Sometimes, friends turned foes let bygones be bygones and return to being friends again and at other times, they just choose to let the cold equation remain as it is. Well, in this case, we could say it’s the latter.</p>
      <p>Sanam Re actresses Yami Gautam and Urvashi Rautela apparently didn’t get along during the film’s shooting in 2016. There were reports that Pulkit Samrat and Yami Gautam (who were dating at the time) largely ignored Urvashi during the film promotions.</p>

      <p>Teen saal ho gaye but it seems like the actresses haven’t forgotten the past. A source present at the STAR Screen Awards last night tells us that Yami looked through Urvashi when they came face-to-face. It so happened that Yami’s team was figuring out a seat for the actress and as she stood there, Urvashi walked past her. Ms Rautela soon did a U-turn and when she came near Yami, she gave her a smile, but one did not see Yami reciprocate. Is Yami still in no mood to patch-up with Rautela?</p>

      <p>Speaking of their film Sanam Re, it failed to live up to audience expectations but <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/pulkit-takes-his-relationship-with-yami-to-the-next-level-introduces-her-to-parents/5783bcf51ebe50f33bd5f637">Pulkit and Yami’s love affair</a> made a lot of noise. And of course, their<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/it-was-yami-gautam-who-dumped-pulkit-samrat-break-up-details/5ab63b19e4a2ba261c9110d8"> subsequent break-up hit headlines.<br/></a><br/>Coming back to the STAR Screen Awards Nite, Yami walked away a happy girl as she bagged the Best Actor (Female) In A Comic Role trophy for her performance in Bala.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- aphimages</i></p>
