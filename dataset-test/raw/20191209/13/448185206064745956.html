      <p><b>Guwahati:</b> Amid the widespread protest by various organizations in Assam and Northeast, the Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday while initiating a debate on the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha informed that the bill will exclude almost all parts of the Northeast except two valleys of Assam as Manipur was brought under the Inner Line Permit (ILP).</p>
      <p>He also mentioned that the concern of Assamese people about their rights for indigenous people shall be taken care of by the Clause VI committee, and therefore, the anti-cab protesters to calm down and understand the philosophy of the CAB.</p>
      <p>He also argued saying that the CAB did not have any religious agenda, hence, the Citizen of India are free to practice any religion and fundamental of the Constitution was not touched, “but we are addressing the refugees only through CAB,” said the Union Home Minister.</p>
      <p>Shah also further argued alleging the previous Congress-led Government had failed to do anything to the Assam Accord and it was the NDA Government that had brought in Clause VI committee to safeguard the interest of the indigenous people.</p>
