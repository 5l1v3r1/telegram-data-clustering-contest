      <p>MANILA, Dec 9 — National doubles pair Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik completed a memorable day on the courts for the 30th SEA Games Malaysian badminton team after delivering the gold medal in the men’s doubles final here today.</p>
      <p>What was even more sweeter was that their 18-21, 21-15 and 21-16 win over Thai pair Bodin Isara-Maneepong Jongjit was their first ever top finish in all international tournaments.</p>
      <p>It also ended a 16-year drought as the last time a Malaysian men’s doubles pair won a SEA Games gold was through Choong Tan Fook-Lee Wan Wah at the 2003 Vietnam edition.</p>
      <p>“Of course, we are elated. This is our first ever international win, something we have been waiting for a long time. We are already at the end of the year and its a good sign as we prepare for the BWF World Tour Finals in Guangzhou right after this,” said Aaron after the match.</p>
      <p>As for Wooi Yik, their first ever international career gold means a lot, and noted that they had to really fight hard for it in the final.</p>
      <p>“We lost the first set due to tactical reasons. In the second, we made some changes and play a lot of rallies as they were more senior and experienced than us.</p>
      <p>“Our gamble paid off and we managed to control the game until the end,” he said.</p>
      <p>In the match played at the Muntinlupa sports complex, the 12th ranked pair in the world lost the first set 18-21.</p>
      <p>They bounced back to dominate the second, before taking the next two sets and beat the world 43rd ranked Thai pair.</p>
      <p>Aaron-Wooi Yik’s win also saw them contributing Malaysia’s third gold on the last day of the badminton competition. — Bernama</p>
