      <h2>Joshua will have one of the largest waxworks ever created located in the Sport zone of the London museum alongside new models of Muhammad Ali, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lewis Hamilton, among others</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:34:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Madame Tussauds are set to pay tribute to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-joshua">Anthony Joshua</a> after the Brit reclaimed his world heavyweight titles against Andy Ruiz Jr on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Joshua <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/anthony-joshua-ruiz-live-stream-21030701">beat Ruiz Jr by unanimous decision</a> after outboxing the Mexican for much of their 12-round contest.</p>
      <p>The win saw Joshua become a two-time world champion, having lost his IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO belts to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-ruiz-jr">Ruiz Jr</a> back in June.</p>
      <p>Now waxwork museum Madame Tussauds is preparing to unveil an immortalised effigy of the Watford-born star, as part of their list of stellar sporting legends for 2020.</p>
      <p>The list includes several other Brits such as six-time Formula One world champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> , four-time Olympic champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mo-farah">Mo Farah</a> , and England's World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore.</p>

      <p>All athletes will have dedicated waxworks stationed in the Sport zone of its museum in Baker Street, London, with Joshua's set to be one of the largest they've ever created, and will be positioned close to the model of his lifelong idol Muhammad Ali.</p>
      <p>Steve Davies, General Manager at Madame Tussauds London, said: “Anthony Joshua came out fighting last night [Saturday] so what better time to announce that we’ll have him in our corner next year.</p>
      <p>"This homegrown hero will quite literally be a HUGE addition to what is shaping up to be a star-studded guest list for 2020 at Madame Tussauds London.”</p>

      <p>Joshua stands at 6ft 4in tall, and weighed in for his bout on Saturday at 16st 3lbs - the lightest he has ever been for a world title fight.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr meanwhile weighed a huge 20st 3lbs, and has since claimed he didn't take the fight seriously and "should have trained harder".</p>
      <p>But Joshua has hit back at his opponent on ITV's Good Morning Britain, and said: "I would love to have trained the way Andy trained.</p>

      <p>"I would love to have trained that way.</p>
      <p>"In reality, that's not the way of a champion.</p>
      <p>"Andy can say all these things, but he knew he had a fight and he knew the best way to prepare."</p>
