      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:35:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-CorrespondentVIRAR-128908/" target="_blank">Special CorrespondentVIRAR</a></address>
      <p>Anish Thapa, relishing the cool early morning conditions, set a course record in the men’s half-marathon at the ninth Indiabulls Vasai Virar Mayor’s Marathon, besides pulling second and third place finisher under the record time.</p>
      <p>The Army runner clocked one hour, four minutes and 37 seconds, bettering G. Lakshmana’s mark of 1:04.56 set in 2014. The half-marathon winner went home richer by ₹1.25 lakh and was followed by Tirtha Pun in 1:04.42 and Dinesh Kumar in 1:04.46 respectively.</p>
      <p>Kiran Sahdev, the women’s half-marathon winner in 1:17,51, also earned ₹1.25 lakh.</p>
      <p>The men’s marathon top place was claimed by Mohit Rathore (2:24.22) after being in a position to better the course record at the half-way point. He went home richer by ₹2.50 lakh.</p>
      <p>The women’s marathon (18-35 years) winner Tsetan Dolkar timed 3:10.29 and won ₹35,000.</p>
      <p>The marathon, held in association with ManipalCigna under the aegis of Athletics Federation of India, started and ended at New Viva College, Virar and the half-marathon flag-off was at Victor Heights, Vasai.</p>
      <p>Rathore said: “With some more competition, I could have done better. I was on course for a 2:20 finish, but could not maintain the pace running alone.”</p>
      <p>Thapa, the men’s half-marathon champion, said the course record was not on his mind. He got into a good rhythm early and with competitors close by, he could maintain the pace throughout the race.</p>
      <p>Kiran clocked her personal best, despite taking care to stay away from injury at the end of a long season.</p>
