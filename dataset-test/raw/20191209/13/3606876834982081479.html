        <b>Sleepy village woken up by heavy military presence</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of the Kenya Defense Forces attached to the Kenya Air Force Nanyuki base on Monday moved swiftly to recover a piece of a fighter jet that fell off while the specialized aircraft was mid-air.</p>
      <p>Villagers in the sleepy Matanya village, on the outskirts of Nanyuki town. were surprised after a glass object resembling a car windshield dropped from the skies.</p>
      <p>The glass object, which turned out to be the canopy of a Kenya Air Force fighter jet, remained intact despite the heavy impact of the fall.</p>
      <p>Within a few minutes of the canopy falling off, KDF soldiers from the Rapid Deployment Squadron were on ground to collect the important piece.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear the circumstances under which the fighter jet lost its canopy which protects the pilot from the heavy winds as the plane pierces the air at supersonic speeds.</p>
