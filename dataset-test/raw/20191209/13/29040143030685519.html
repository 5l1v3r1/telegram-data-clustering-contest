      <p>Developers, speak out. Where is the software industry going next? The new <a href="https://developereconomics.net/?member_id=mobile-nations&amp;lang=en">Developer Economics survey Q4 2019</a> is now open to all developers around the world until January 17th. Every year, more than 40,000 developers from 165+ countries participate in the Developer Economics surveys to set new trends in software development. This is a chance for all developers to be part of something great and set the industry trends, opportunities, and challenges for 2019.</p>
      <p>What skills do you think are necessary for today's developers? Which popular dev tools, platforms, technologies, and frameworks do you enjoy using or you have tried but disliked or want to learn more about? Answers to such questions will help us discover what's missing in the industry.</p>
