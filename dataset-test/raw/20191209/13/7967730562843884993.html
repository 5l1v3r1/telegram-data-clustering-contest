      <h1>Lost your kid at an event? This Sydney couple may have the answer</h1>

      <p>It was the panic after one of her sons wandered off at the Sydney Family Show that caused Gabby Stein's business brainwave.</p>
      <p>"Our son Ben did go missing temporarily and we freaked out," the founder of GPS kid tracker Luboo said.</p>

      <p>After the family was reunited, Ms Stein and her husband Rahm Erez were talking with friends about how they could have avoided the stress of the situation.</p>
      <p>"We said, we don't want to track our kids all the time, but wouldn't it be good if we could rent something?" she said.</p>
      <p>There are a range of GPS trackers in the local market for keeping track of young wanderers, but <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-glbyo9.html">privacy concerns are front of mind</a> when children are involved in the world's multi-billion dollar wearable technologies market. The couple wanted an alternative to having to buy a smart device and pay for the required mobile data.</p>
      <p>Over the past two years the duo have workshopped a product families could rent at large public events and theme parks for the day, so parents can easily pinpoint their location if they did get separated from their kids.</p>
      <p>Ms Stein and Mr Erez, whose backgrounds are in law and architecture, worked with teams in Australia and Israel to build a waterproof tracker that can be rented from $10 from a participating venue.</p>
      <p>"What we were most surprised about was the appetite of the venues to partner with us," Ms Stein said.</p>
      <p>Over the past year the founders have spent significant time in California preparing to launch the technology at theme parks this coming summer.</p>
      <p>They've also piloted the technology back in Sydney at venues like the Australian Walkabout Wildlife Park at Calga.</p>

      <p>Luboo, which is a combination of nicknames Ms Stein and Mr Erez have for their children, will test the US market this month with a soft launch at theme park California's Great America in the lead-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Parents can rent the Luboo device at a venue and attach a wristband to their kids. They then download an app which tracks the user's movements throughout their time at the event.</p>
      <p>The company was born in Sydney and has refined its offer through accelerators including Telstra's muru-D program, but the founders see global appeal. They have so far tipped in $500,000, including contributions from private investors in Australia and Israel.</p>
      <p>There are a number of GPS competitors and kid-focused smart devices on the market, including the the Spacetalk watch, which is sold in Australia via ASX-listed MGM Wireless. These retail from around $350.</p>
      <blockquote>We don't want to track our child all the time — I want to be able to trust our child. We are saying, there should be a middle ground.<cite>Luboo co-founder Gabby Stein.</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Ms Stein said the appeal of Luboo was it was not designed for everyday use, instead providing an anonymised way of finding kids in a stressful situation.</p>
      <p>"We don't want to track our child all the time — I want to be able to trust our child. We are saying, there should be a middle ground,"Ms Stein said.</p>
      <p>The founders haven't hired any staff yet for Luboo ahead of its formal launch in 2020. Pricing for venues to own a set of the trackers is yet to be formalised.</p>
      <p>Ms Stein said there were fitting parallels between the experience of launching a startup and the rides at the venues they were looking to crack.</p>
      <p>"One of our biggest lessons apart from just being steadfast is accepting it is a rollercoaster," she said.</p>
