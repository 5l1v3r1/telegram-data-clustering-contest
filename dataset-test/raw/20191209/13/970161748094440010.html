      <p>Speaking on Loose Women on Monday, Rod said: ‘We were absolutely shattered, but I had this marvelous specimen of a woman by my side to get me through it.’</p>
      <p>He continued to make music and tour while receiving treatment and credited his work ethic will helping him overcome it.</p>
      <p>‘I worked for two years knowing it was there. You can’t dwell on it. Be confident and let God take care of the rest,’ Rod said.</p>

      <p>‘My dad never went to the dentist and he died with no teeth,’ he revealed.</p>
      <p>‘Please guys, finger up the bum no harm done.’</p>
      <p>Rod is currently on tour and promoting his new album which reworks his classic hits with help from the London Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>
      <p>He told host Andrea McLean that he never gets tired of singing his most loved tracks to audiences over and over again – apart from one.</p>
      <p>The star confessed: ‘Maybe Do You Think I’m Sexy?. The audience don’t [get tired of it]. What the audience want is what I want.’</p>
      <p>Rod also thanked ‘black culture’ for inspiring him in his career.</p>
      <p>The Maggie May singer has eight children and has been married to Penny, who was also on Monday’s Loose Women, since 2007.</p>
      <p>She has previously discussed what life would be like with her husband, who is 26 years older than her.</p>
      <p>‘Rod’s in his 70s, early 70s, and we have a huge family base at home,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘My life is based on the family, Rod, the children, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
      <p>‘I do on occasions think, when I’m Rod’s age, I won’t have my husband and the children will be grown up and gone, and I kind of feel that I need to prepare.’</p>
