      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. -- City council members are expected to vote on a noise ordinance Monday night in Cape Coral.</p>
      <p>There is also a public hearing scheduled.</p>
      <p>Back in July, the discussion was tabled because the members wanted more public input.</p>
      <p>The ordinance calls for a $150 fine for loud noises within 50 feet of your car and 100 feet of your home.</p>
      <p>The meeting is scheduled for 4:30pm in the council chambers at 1015 Cultural Park Boulevard.</p>
