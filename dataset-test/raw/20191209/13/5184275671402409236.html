      <p>In an earlier interview to acclaimed film critic, Rajeev Masand, Sushmita has revealed that she voluntarily choose to take the sabbatical to make sure she spend more time with her daughters. For those unversed, Sushmita is a single mom to two beautiful daughters, Renee and Alisah. Speaking to Rajeev, Sushmita said, “I know that people say that your best years are your youthful years where you can do films and you look younger etc. I asked myself, ‘If I don’t do films right now and I focus on this, will I regret it? And if I choose to not be with Alisah and go do films, which one would I regret more?’ It was a no-brainer for me.”</p>
      <p>She further said, “It’s not just seeing their first step or first word, that I missed out for Renee. It’s their personality development, to witness who they are becoming. I did not sponsor a child; I became a mother.”</p>
      <p>While we certainly are excited for the diva’s return, do let us know your thoughts about the same.</p>
