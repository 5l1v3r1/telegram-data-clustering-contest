      <p>With an arsenal packed full of hit songs like “Don't Dream it's Over” and “Fall at your Feet”, the band's 2020 tour is sure to be one of the hottest tickets in town. Here's everything you need to know about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Did Crowded House get back together?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The band's first incarnation lasted from 1985 to 1995, and they produced four studio albums: Crowded House, Temple of Low Men, Woodface and Together Alone. They performed their final show at the Sydney Opera House in 1996 in front of 150,000 people.</p>
      <p>In 2005, following the tragic death of drummer Paul Hester, Neil and Nick reformed Crowded House to put some more good history, as they described it, into the story of the band.</p>

      <p>Drafting in new drummer Matt Sherrod and with long time touring member Mark Hart, they released the album Time On Earth to critical acclaim and toured the world.</p>
      <p>Another album, Intriguer, was recorded in 2009 and Crowded House was inducted into the Aria Hall of Fame in 2016, at the same time reprising its Farewell shows at the Sydney Opera House with three nights of performances.</p>

        <b>What songs will they play?</b>
      </p>
      <p>During their European tour in 2020, the band is likely to play songs from their eponymous debut album Crowded House, with hits like Don't Dream It's Over - one of the most covered songs of the last 20 years - and Something so Strong.</p>
      <p>Other famous tracks you're likely to hear are Fall at your Feet, Four Seasons in One Day, and Weather With You from the band's 1991 album Woodface, and Better Be Home Soon from the 1988 record Temple of Low Men.</p>
      <p>In addition to touring, the band also recently noted that they are spending time in the studio with new music on the horizon - so there may be some new material performed on the tour as well.<br/><br/><b>How can I get tickets?</b></p>
