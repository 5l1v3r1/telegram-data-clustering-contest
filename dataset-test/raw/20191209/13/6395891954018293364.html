      <p><b>LOUISVILLE, Ky.Â (AP)</b> - It may be the holiday season, but police in Kentucky confiscated an unusual gift being delivered to a Kentucky man's home - a package with about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of meth that was shipped through the mail inside of an air fryer.</p>
      <p>Narcotics officers were able to intercept the parcel containing about $100,000 worth of drugs, Louisville Metro police said in a Facebook post Saturday.</p>
      <p>The package was delivered to a suspect's home where officers obtained a search warrant to collect it, the Major Case Unit confirmed to news outlets. The suspect wasn't home at time of seizure.</p>
      <p>Photos posted by the police department show at least seven packages of drugs wrapped in plastic alongside the Hamilton Beach brand air fryer and the box it came in.</p>
      <p>Police say the investigation is ongoing.</p>
