      <p><b>Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT |</b> Kampala Metropolitan Police have launched a hunt for four machete-wielding thugs that raided the convent of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa in Bunamwaya, and robbed an unspecified amount of money.</p>
      <p>Kampala Metropolitan Deputy Police Spokesperson Luke Owoyesigyire says that the thugs raided the convent at 2 am on Monday and went through the various offices, where they stole cash and two laptops. However, none of the nuns was hurt.</p>
      <p>Police personnel from Bunamwaya and Nateete Police Stations visited the crime scene and recorded statements from nuns, who alerted the authorities long after the machete-wielding men left the convent.</p>
      <p>The convent, located at Gobi B zone is under the Katwe Policing Division superintended by Kampala South region.</p>
      <p>Similar raids on clerics and worship centres have become regular in Kampala and Wakiso districts in recent months. In September, a security guard shot dead a suspected thug later identified as William Otuke, who was breaking into Lubaga Catholic shrine in Rubaga Division Kampala, allegedly, to steal offertory.</p>
      <p>Rubaga Catholic shrine contains images and statutes that resonate with the history of Catholicism in Uganda, white fathers and past clergy.</p>
      <p>This incident came hardly after another break-in at St Augustine Chapel, Makerere University in which thugs made off with offertories. Fr Josephat Ddungu, the chaplain, released Closed Circuit Television- CCTV footage showing the thug breaking into the chapel on the night of August 12 around midnight and varnishing with an unspecified sum of money.</p>
      <p>Fr Ddungu said other items that were stolen from the chapel included a laptop, extension cables, boxes where the offertory for Mother Mary and Radio Maria were being kept. He asked members of the public to help identify the thief.</p>
