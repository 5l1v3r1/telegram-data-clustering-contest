      <p>Lawrence, a man whose life was upside down, and without home, has triumphed over all odds to training to become an aircraft engineer.</p>
      <p>Ladbible reports that he was always sleeping in the airport during the time he was homeless. The overcomer said that he had always dreamt about working in the aviation sector.</p>
      <p>All that dream went downhill when he could not keep up at school and there was no father figure to give him enough motivation.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Growing up, I had a lack of role models in my life - my dad was largely absent. School for me was a tricky time.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Again, not having a dad around me to support me and a lack of stable upbringing affected me. I spent a lot of my education feeling frustrated and unfocused,” </i>she said.</p>

      <p>He said that not having the means to get to where he wanted, he lost focus and had to settle for doing odd jobs to keep himself going.</p>
      <p>Lawrence said his major challenge was not about getting a job, but getting something that is stable enough that could give a consistent income.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"For me, the problem wasn't with getting work, it was more an issue with finding something stable. I ended up becoming a cleaner at an airport, but the job was more focused on survival and getting by, rather than doing something I really enjoyed.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"The whole experience ended up being really stressful. My income wasn't consistent, and I didn't have a fixed address at the time as I was sofa surfing. Sometimes I was even sleeping at the airport where I worked - just so I could get to work on time,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Lawrence said that now he has got a job on railway tracks, he can now rent a his own place, saying all it takes was someone to believe in you.</p>
      <p>Knowing that he would need to upskill himself, he stumbled on an organisation that help with employment training through crowdfunding for homeless people.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I was able to crowdfund £4,449 from 228 members of the public so that I could train as a railway engineer.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"This is a great stepping stone and will give me the experience I need to eventually become an aircraft engineer - which is still the dream," </i>he said</p>
