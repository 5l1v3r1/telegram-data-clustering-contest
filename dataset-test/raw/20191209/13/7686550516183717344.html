      <p>Across the UK, some 400,000 NHS staff are expected to work on Christmas Day alone this year. An estimated 82,000 nurses and 55,000 nursing assistants will be working in hospitals, while 12,000 midwives are expected to welcome around 1,400 babies.</p>
      <p>Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe said: "We all know someone who works tirelessly over Christmas to keep the NHS running and this is our way of saying thank you.</p>
      <p>"For the third year, we're offering NHS doctors, nurses and support staff a helping hand to get to and from work at Christmas time when public transport is limited.</p>
      <p>"This year, it's fantastic to extend the offer to provide a free meal to help make those shifts a little easier."</p>

      <p>To encourage as many NHS workers as possible to register, ex-junior doctor turned author, Adam Kay, has partnered with Uber to give away 1,000 copies of his book, 'Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas'.</p>
      <p>The festive follow-up to the acclaimed 'This is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor', follows the life of a junior doctor featuring diary entries from Christmas shifts and offering a love letter from Adam Kay to all those who spend their festive season on the front line.</p>
      <p>He said: "While you're eating your body weight in carbohydrates this Christmas Day, almost half a million NHS staff will be on the wards.</p>
      <p>"Having worked for a bunch of Christmases as a junior doctor, I'm very aware of how far a kind gesture can go this time of year.</p>
      <p>"If you're working on the front line this Christmas, or know someone who is, please do ensure you're registered for this token of appreciation."</p>
