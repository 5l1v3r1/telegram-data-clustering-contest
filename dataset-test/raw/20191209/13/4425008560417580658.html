      <h2>Impacts of finding on defunct consultancy unclear.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:37:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/nandita-bose-and-susan-heavey-1463980" target="_blank">Nandita Bose and Susan Heavey</a></address>
      <p>US regulators on Friday said they had found now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica deceived consumers about the collection of Facebook Inc data for voter profiling and targeting.</p>
      <p>The Federal Trade Commission also found that Cambridge Analytica engaged in deceptive practices relating to its participation in the EU-US Privacy Shield framework - a pact on the cross-border transfer of personal data.</p>
      <p>The agency order prohibits Cambridge Analytica from misrepresenting the extent to which it protects the privacy and confidentiality of personal information.</p>
      <p>It also stops the consulting firm from participating in the EU-US Privacy Shield framework and other similar regulatory organisations.</p>
      <p>The impact of the agency order is not immediately clear as the consulting firm is no longer in business.</p>
      <p>The order comes after Facebook agreed in July to pay a record-breaking US$5 billion fine to the FTC, in order to resolve a government probe into its privacy practices.</p>
      <p>The government agency continues to pursue a separate antitrust investigation of the company.</p>
      <p>The FTC's probe into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica was triggered by allegations that Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree by inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with Cambridge Analytica.</p>
      <p>The consultancy’s clients included President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign.</p>
      <p>The FTC voted 5-0 to issue the opinion and final order against Cambridge Analytica.</p>
