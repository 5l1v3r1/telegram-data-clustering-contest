        <li>Miss <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/myanmar">Myanmar</a> contestant Swe Zin Htet made history as the first openly gay contestant to walk down the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/miss-universe-2019">Miss Universe</a> runway on Sunday.</li>
        <li>Despite not winning the competition, the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/miss-universe-myanmar-gay-intl-hnk-scli/index.html">Miss Universe organization has dubbed Zin Htet as “inspirational.”</a></li>
        <li>The 20-year-old publically came out just before the competition began in Atlanta, Georgia just a few weeks ago in an interview with <a href="https://www.missosology.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=0&amp;amp;t=1759906">beauty pageant forum, Missosology.</a></li>
        <li>“I came to a full realization about my sexual orientation over a long time. I knew I was ‘one of them’ way back in 2015 … It is personally quite challenging but I feel that I have a greater voice and the best position to promote this cause,” she said.</li>
        <li>Same-sex relationships are illegal in Myanmar, though, the law is rarely enforced, according to the <a href="https://www.mmtimes.com/lifestyle/26228-prejudice-and-progress-a-snapshot-of-lgbt-rights-in-myanmar.html">Myanmar Times.</a></li>
        <li>The Miss Universe community <a href="https://www.insider.com/miss-universe-miss-spain-first-transgender-contestant-honored-2018-12">also celebrated its first trans competitor</a> last year from Spain.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/miss-universe-2019">Miss Universe’s</a> first openly gay contestant strutted down the runway on Sunday night despite coming from a country where homosexuality is criminalized.</p>
      <p>Miss <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/myanmar">Myanmar</a> representative Swe Zin Htet may not have been crowned the title but the 20-year-old still made history for the long-running beauty pageant.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/miss-universe-winner-reaction-photos-2019-12">After Miss South Africa won the competition,</a> Zin Htet apologized to fans on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MissSweZinHtet/posts/1180849815638282">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B52cEuqAS-A/">Instagram</a> for not making the top 20 by writing “sry….” and was inundated with comments of support from those who said she did Myanmar proud.</p>

      <p>The Miss Universe Organization also championed Zin Htet for being “brave enough” to share her story in a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/miss-universe-myanmar-gay-intl-hnk-scli/index.html">statement published shortly after the competition.</a></p>
      <p>“We are honored to give a platform to strong, inspirational women like Miss Universe Myanmar, who are brave enough to share their unique stories with the world,” wrote the group’s president Paula Shugart.</p>
      <p>In its 67 years, not one Miss Universe contestant has been openly gay until Zin Htet publically came out just before the competition in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.missosology.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=0&amp;amp;t=1759906">Known to her fans as “Superman,” Htet told pageant forum Missosology</a> she’s been gay for five years but decided to let the world know in an effort to “promote equality” and “freedom of choice.”</p>
      <p>“I came to a full realization about my sexual orientation over a long time. I knew I was ‘one of them’ way back in 2015.</p>
      <p>“It is personally quite challenging but I feel that I have a greater voice and the best position to promote this cause.”</p>

      <p>Section 377 of Myanmar’s colonial-era Penal Code outlaws same-sex activities, <a href="https://www.mmtimes.com/lifestyle/26228-prejudice-and-progress-a-snapshot-of-lgbt-rights-in-myanmar.html">according to the Myanmar Times.</a></p>
      <p>While the law carries sentences ranging from 10 years to life, it is very rarely used in practice, the publication states.</p>

      <p>“I believe that not all countries allow same-sex marriage. I want the world to accept the LGBTQ+ community and their right to choose their own path and pursuit of happiness,” Htet told Missosology.</p>
      <p>After coming out, Zin Htet posted a photo collage to Instagram with the rainbow pride flag splashed across with the word “Proud.”</p>

      <p>Despite Zin Htet having to return to a country that condemns her sexuality, <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/miss-universe-is-breaking-barriers-with-its-first-openly-gay-contestant">she told Glamour</a> that she hopes her act of bravery will allow not only more Burmese people to open up, but also inspire other beauty pageant contestants.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/miss-universe-miss-spain-first-transgender-contestant-honored-2018-12">Last year, Miss Universe had its first-ever trans contestant heralding from Spain,</a> and this year the winners of <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/miss-universe-is-breaking-barriers-with-its-first-openly-gay-contestant">Miss America, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA were all black women.</a></p>
