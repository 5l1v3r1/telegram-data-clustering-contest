      <p>Bidvest Wits had an unhappy trip to Mali this weekend, but were very unlucky not to come home with at least a point from Djoliba AC in Bamako. </p>

      <p>The Clever Boys are still waiting for their first win in the group stages of this year’s CAF Confederation Cup after drawing in their opening game against Horoya, however it wasn’t to be over the weekend as they were beaten 1-0 by Djoliba thanks to a first half goal from Talatou Djibo.</p>
      <p>Gavin Hunt’s side huffed and puffed, and created numerous chances for themselves, but when captain, Thulani Hlatshwayo, hit the woodwork with a bullet header in extra-time, it became apparent that it wasn’t going to be their day.</p>

      <p>The result means Wits are currently third in Group C after two games, but they do have a chance to climb up the table in their last game of the year on December 29 when they take on Al-Nasr at home. </p>
