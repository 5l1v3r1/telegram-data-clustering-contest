      <p>Video of a student assaulting the former president of the Sacramento State College Republicans has gone viral.</p>
      <p>The confrontation between Floyd Johnson II and his attacker, Keaton Hill, began after an argument on a mutual friend's anti-abortion Facebook post, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article238146364.html">according to the <i>Sacramento Bee</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Hill confronted Johnson, a fellow political science student, about the online argument in person before apparently slapping him in the face at least once, the video shows.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t choose to fight back because I’m 6-foot-5 and he’s 5-foot-6 or 5-foot-7 or something. It really would have been unfair,” Johnson told the paper. “And anyway, the way he was hitting me was open-handed. If he was connecting and actually hurting me, then I would have engaged with him, but in that moment I was more focused on videoing the incident and recording what was going on.”</p>
      <p>Johnson said he reported the incident to local police, who are investigating.</p>
      <p>No charges have been announced as a result of the incident.</p>
