      <p>England players will wear black armbands during the first Test of their tour of South Africa in honour of former bowler <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Bob_Willis">Bob Willis</a>.</p>
      <p>Willis, who captained England before turning to punditry after retirement in 1984, died last week at the age of 70.</p>

      <p>The first Test begins on Boxing Day as part of a four-match series against the Proteas, followed by three one-day internationals and three T20 clashes.</p>
