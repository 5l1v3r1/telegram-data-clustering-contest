      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: After 70 days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Sungai Buloh Hospital, the premature baby of actress and singer Abby Abadi, Muhammad Danial Firman, drew his last breath last Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old Gerak Khas star, who is currently in Mecca to perform her umrah (minor haj) with family members, shared the tragic news via her Instagram account.</p>
      <p>In the post, the artiste whose real name is Arbaiyah Abdul Manan, also shared that Muhammad Danial Firman was buried at the AU4 Islamic cemetery in Lembah Keramat yesterday.</p>
      <p>She uploaded an accompanying video clip that featured her baby boy as well as an apology for not being able to be by his side during his passing.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “Muhammad Danial Firman has left us. This is the last video before we left him to perform our umrah last Thursday. Please forgive Mama and Abah.”</p>
      <p>Abby’s husband, Faizal Zakaria, was also saddened by the unfortunate passing of his child, lovingly known as Baby D.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post, he wrote: “Baby D, you left us on the second day Abah and Mama were in Mecca. I feel so sad as I could not see you for the very last time. Please forgive me for not being able to do the necessary for you during your passing. I pray that God will reunite us in heaven when the time comes.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Abby’s former husband, actor Norman Hakim, had also expressed his sadness at Baby D’s untimely passing.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post he wrote: “Although we did not get the chance to meet, we all really loved you Baby D. Everyday we heard about your development from your Abah and Mama. And now with God’s blessing you are in heaven after leaving us.”</p>
      <p>It was reported that Muhammad Danial Firman was born by caesarean section on Sept 27, weighing at only 535 grammes. Abby had earlier suffered from bleeding due to high blood pressure.</p>
      <p>The baby was Abby’s first biological child with Faizal after they tied the knot on Aug 15 in 2015. The couple have two adopted children, Muhammad Daiyan Fayyan and Maisara Dayana Fathia.</p>
      <p>Abby, a former member of music girl group Elite, was married to Norman from 2002 to 2008. They had three children from the union, Mohamed Danish Hakim 16, Marissa Dania Hakim, 14, and Maria Danisah Hakim, 11.</p>
