      <h1>Nvidia lawyer pushes court to dismiss cryptocurrency mining chip lawsuit</h1>
      <h2>Cryptocurrency miners much preferred their standard gaming chips</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:43:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">David Canellis</a></address>
      <p>Graphics card manufacturer Nvidia has argued that investors cherry-picked corporate statements while ignoring others that supposedly showed transparency, as a lawsuit over its failing cryptocurrency mining chips intensifies.</p>
      <p>Nvidia‘s legal counsel also claimed that investors can’t rely on “speculative expectations of third-party analysts” as the basis of their suit, which should be dismissed, <a href="https://www.law360.com/classaction/articles/1226031/nvidia-rips-morgan-stanley-analyst-s-role-in-stock-drop-suit-">Law360</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Spurned investors have alleged that Nvidia‘s financial reports misled them into believing that high-demand for its gaming chips was entirely separate from the cryptocurrency boom.</p>
      <p>Their suit claims the firm had told analysts that most of its cryptocurrency-related sales came from its Crypto SKU, a cryptocurrency-mining chip released in May 2017.</p>
      <p>Miners were instead still buying their gaming-specific chips to generate cryptocurrency before the Crypto SKU flopped. Nvidia‘s gaming revenues reportedly continued to increase during this time.</p>
      <p>Investors have claimed that, in August 2018, Nvidia revealed it had been reporting its cryptocurrency-related revenues together with its gaming totals. At the time, the cryptocurrency market was collapsing, and its gaming revenues were also dwindling.</p>
      <p>Nvidia‘s share price reportedly fell 29 percent in the fallout.</p>
      <p>Back in August, Hard Fork <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/08/16/nvidias-gpu-sales-normalize-crypto-mining-craze/">reported</a> that Nvidia‘s chief financial officer had told analysts that its business had finally “normalized” after the Crypto SKU fiasco.</p>
      <p>The firm’s chief exec even confirmed that cryptocurrency mining would add “no contributions” to Nvidia‘s bottom line in the following months.</p>
      <p>As for the attorney representing Nvidia‘s spurned investors, he reportedly claimed on Friday that the firm’s execs had said crypto-related revenue was small, but that its effect was actually so large that it forced the company to miss its earnings that fiscal year.</p>
      <p>To which effect, Law360 reports he ultimately argued Nvidia‘s partial disclosures didn’t give investors or analysts the “full appreciation” of the company’s performance.</p>
      <p>As for the judge, he reportedly thinks that the investors have alleged a solid theory. The suit is yet to be decided upon, so this should be considered a developing story.</p>
