      <h1>Okaya Kaya Shares Endearing Synth-Charged Single "Asexual Wellbeing"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:38:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Hayden Goodridge  </a></address>
      <p>The Norwegian-born Kaya Wilkins—under her artist moniker Okay Kaya—has released the latest single from her Jagjaguwar debut, <i>Watch This Liquid Pour Itself</i>, a platonically tender ballad with the wonderful title of “Asexual Wellbeing.”</p>
      <p>The synth-driven track draws influence from the unabashedly synthetic feeling of ’80s house, with echoing synth and a pulsing drum pad building the foundation under Wilkins’ voice. With a fantastic deadpan delivery, she lays out her less-than-appealing sex life without shame. “I know sex with me is mediocre,” she sings in the hook, “but I can give you asexual wellbeing.”</p>
      <p>The accompanying music video—co-directed by Adinah Dancyger and Wilkins—opens with a close-up shot of a half-eaten hard-boiled egg and only continues to get weirder. In the prelude, Wilkins reads what appears to be a poem called “Moth Juice” before the music kicks off. Through the retro lens of handheld film footage, we’re given unexplained shots of a mannequin hand formed into the “rock on” sign, Kaya applying black-metal makeup to her friends and the three proceeding to dance around crumbled ruins. The video was shot on location in Bornholm, Denmark and holds a distinctly timeless atmosphere throughout.</p>
      <p>Instead of clearing up the many questions raised from the surreal music video, Kaya’s description of the project—delivered in free-verse poetry—only rattles our brains more:</p>
      <p>island mud house<br/>horses and stringy apple tree<br/>blood of beet meals<br/>baby in a moth suit clipping the <br/>clothing-rack soon dry<br/>look out for a field<br/>be fire and dv’s and shitty driving good music<br/>imitate algae in the coolest jacket to exist<br/>loving your loved ones like it’s never going to end don’t let the hand deject you<br/>except the shadow it gives<br/>paint face true Scandinavian inappropriate<br/>hang out by historical landmarks and feeling<br/>NOTHING</p>
      <p><i>Watch This Liquid Pour Itself</i> is set for release on Jan. 24, 2020, on Jagjaguwar and can be preordered <a href="https://www.secretlystore.com/watch-this-liquid-pour-itself-okay-kaya">here</a>.
