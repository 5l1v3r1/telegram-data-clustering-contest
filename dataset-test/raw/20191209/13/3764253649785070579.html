      <p>Premier League side Everton have reportedly approached Spanish football coach Unai Emery about the possibility of him becoming their next manager.</p>
      <p>This latest approach comes ten days after the former Paris-Saint-Germain handler was sacked at Arsenal due to unimpressive performance this season in all competitions.</p>
      <p>According to the report on Sky Sports, an informal meeting has been held in London, but Unai Emery explained that he needs more time for him to think about his next move.</p>
      <p>Everton are currently looking for another manager after recently sacking Marco Silva and they are currently occupying 14th position on the Premier League standings.</p>

      <p>Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti who now handles Napoli has also been linked with a move to Everton according to the report.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Freddie Ljungberg who replaced Unai Emery on interim capacity as Arsenal manager has also not been doing well for the Gunners and the club could hire a permanent boss soon.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1280087-unai-emery-spaniard-manager-sacked-arsenal-2-1-loss-frankfurt.html"> Unai Emery was sacked by Arsenal</a> following a torrid run of lacklustre performance that saw the Premier League side forfeit an early lead to suffer another 2-1 defeat to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was shown the way out of Emirates Stadium after eighteen months in charge of the North London side.</p>
      <p>His sacking was confirmed in a statement by Arsenal on Friday, November 29, ending growing speculations surrounding the former PSG boss' future with the Gunners.</p>
