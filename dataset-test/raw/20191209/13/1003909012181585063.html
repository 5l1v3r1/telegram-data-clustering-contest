      <h1>Scale model of Springbank dam tests flood diversion impacts, raises critics' ire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:41:25+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:41</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Kaufmann</a></address>
      <p>While final approval of the Springbank dry dam has been held up by regulatory hurdles, a model has been quietly built, far from prying eyes.</p>
      <p>It’s a 1/16-scale version of the project — complete with identical and functional sluices, spillways, crest gates and even the woody flotsam it’s expected to catch during flooding.</p>
      <p>Water has been forced through the model at velocities calculated to simulate a potentially disastrous flood.</p>
      <p>The 50-metre by 30-metre model of the $432-million dam and reservoir was built by National Research Council of Canada employees in one of the agency’s cavernous Ottawa facilities.</p>
      <p>Those behind the reproduction — which cost $800,000 to build and use — say it was crucial in helping to understand how the dam would function during a high-water event that would let loose many tonnes of debris along the Elbow River.</p>
      <p>But opponents of the full-sized project — meant to prevent a repeat of the 2013 flooding that submerged parts of Calgary — say building the model’s a pricey slap-in-the-face.</p>
      <p>“They continue to spend so much money to push this project while it’s still held up,” said Karin Hunter, president of the Springbank Community Association.</p>
      <p>She said the mere existence of the huge model doesn’t inspire confidence among residents who live near the proposed site 15 kilometres west of Calgary along Highways 8 and 22.</p>
      <p>“It shows how unsure they are about how it would run, the uncertainty of it,” said Hunter.</p>
      <p>Federal environmental regulators have repeatedly sought more information on the project, prompting the province to send them an 8,000-page document last spring.</p>
      <p>In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman with Alberta Transportation said the dam reproduction was commissioned by the previous NDP government in 2016 and was mandated by Ottawa.</p>
      <p>“Detailed modellings on items such as water pressure and sediment deposit are required as part of the regulatory review process, and using a lab environment allows the best opportunity to create/re-create actual conditions,” wrote Brooklyn Elhard.</p>
      <p>Provincial officials say tests using the model have led to several modifications to the dam’s diversion inlet and river gates that include improving the structure’s hydraulics.</p>
      <p>Officials with engineering firm Stantec, which is also involved in the full-scale project, ran tests on the wood, metal, gravel and concrete model which was dismantled in November 2016.</p>

      <p>Hunter said those likely to be impacted by the dam would like to know any results from the model and to have seen it in action themselves.</p>
      <p>“The build up of debris has been a concern all along; why hasn’t anyone talked to us about this?” she said.</p>
      <p>However, it’s simply good due diligence to construct such a model and its cost is likely well worth it, said Brenda Leeds Binder of the Calgary Rivers Communities Action Group, which supports the project.</p>
      <p>“It sounds entirely prudent considering they’re building something they haven’t built before in Alberta, to my knowledge,” she said.</p>
      <p>Some local landowners, Rocky View County, some MLAs and leaders of the nearby Tsuut’ina First Nation have expressed opposition to the proposed site of the dam and have argued a better alternative could be built upstream of Bragg Creek at McLean Creek.</p>
      <p>Proponents say considerable research has ruled out McLean Creek as environmentally — and financially — viable while Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi has called the Springbank project crucial in protecting the city, adding the project’s further delay is unacceptable.</p>
      <p>It would store water in an amount equivalent to 28,000 Olympic-sized pools, releasing it back into the Bow River after the end of a flooding event.</p>
