      <p>Liverpool heads to the polls on December 12 to elect the city's five MPs in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">2019 General Election</a> .</p>
      <p>On the day itself, anyone without a postal vote will need to go to a polling station to cast their ballot in person.</p>
      <p>Each polling station will be open from 7am until 10pm, and most are located in public buildings like schools or church halls.</p>
      <p>If you have already registered, you should have been sent a polling card in the post telling you where to cast your vote.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of each constituency's polling stations. But bear in mind, your nearest polling station may not be the one you need to vote at.</p>
