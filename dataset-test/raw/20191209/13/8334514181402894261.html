      <h1>General Motors pulls out of Russian car assembly business with Avtovaz deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:13:36+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Gleb Stolyarov, Alexander Marrow</a></address>
      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s biggest automaker Avtovaz said on Monday it would buy out General Motors (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GM.N">GM.N</a>) from their joint venture producing vehicles in Russia under the Chevrolet brand, effectively ending GM’s presence in car assembling in the country.</p>
      <p>Russia’s car market was among Europe’s top performers before the imposition of western sanctions in 2014 which, coupled with falling oil prices, sharply weakened the rouble, increased the cost of buying a car and curbed Russians’ ability to buy new vehicles.</p>
      <p>As a result, foreign carmakers started to rethink their strategies of doing business in Russia.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Avtovaz signed an agreement to buy GM’s 50% stake in the venture, which sees the two companies produce the Chevrolet Niva car from a factory in Togliatti, a city on the Volga river.</p>
      <p>Avtovaz did not disclose financial details of the deal which would end GM’s presence in the car assembling business in Russia.</p>
      <p>According to the agreement, the factory will continue producing and selling cars under the Chevrolet brand for “a certain period of time” before switching to Russia’s Lada brand.</p>
      <p>Built in 2001, the Togliatti factory has the capacity to make up to 100,000 cars a year and produces the Chevrolet Niva, whose design was based on the Soviet-era Niva by Avtovaz engineers and developed further with GM’s input.</p>
      <p>Russia’s automobile market has struggled in 2019, with sales of new cars in November falling by 6.4% year-on-year, the Association of European Businesses (AEB) said last Thursday.</p>
