        <b>The Smithsonian Museum has urged people to start telling Halloween style horror stories at Christmas time again.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although now firmly associated with the run-up to October 31st, horror was vividly associated with Christmas well into the 20th century.</p>
      <p>Gradually, however, the tradition was displaced thanks to waves of Irish and Scottish immigrants to the United States. It was these incomers who brought the traditional Celtic festival of <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/topic/halloween">Halloween</a> to the US and gradually Americans claimed it as their own.</p>

      <p>References to spooky Christmas tales are replete in English <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/topic/books">literature</a>: Shakespeare informs theatergoers in "A Winter’s Tale" that  “A sad tale’s best for winter.”</p>
      <p>Dickens’ seminal Yuletide story "A Christmas Carol" in 1842 gifted the world the enduring Christmas villain in the shape of Scrooge.</p>

      <p>A more recent example is the 1957 book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" by Dr. Seuss, about a malevolent character who tries to steal Christmas decorations in the hope it will prevent residents of the town of Whoville celebrating the big day.</p>

      <p>Other spooky Christmas stories include "A Strange Christmas Game,"  by J. H. Riddell about ghosts and "Smee," by A. M. Burrage which tells the tale of a Christmas Eve game of hide and seek that becomes terrifyingly strange.</p>
