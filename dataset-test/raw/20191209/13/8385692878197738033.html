      <p><a href="http://ulefone.com/">Ulefone</a> is very proud of its Armor 7 handset. The company announced that phone a while back, and is now sharing reasons why you should consider getting the Armor 7 as a Christmas gift.</p>
      <p>The company listed six reasons why you should consider getting someone, or yourself, the Armor 7 as a Christmas gift. Let's first cover what Ulefone has to say, and then we'll give you some purchasing information.</p>
      <h3>It's a versatile outdoor assistant</h3>
      <p>This is the very first reason. The Ulefone Armor 7 is both IP68/IP69K and MIL-STD-810G certified. So, the phone can withstand water immersion, dust, shock, extreme temperatures, and so on. It also comes with a number of tools and sensors you may need for your adventure.</p>

      <h3>It has three rear cameras, lead by a 48-megapixel sensor</h3>
      <p>The Armor 7 is equipped with three rather capable cameras on the back. The main sensor on the back is a 48-megapixel one, and it comes with AI scene recognition. There is also a dedicated 16-megapixel camera for low light photography, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens.</p>
      <h3>The Armor 7 is fueled by the Helio P90 SoC</h3>
      <p>The Helio P90 is one of MediaTek's best mid-range processors, if not the best one. It is quite capable in the processing department, and can handle the most complex AI apps and tasks. The Armor 7 is running quite smooth mainly thanks to this chip.</p>
      <h3>The device is equipped with 8GB of RAM</h3>
      <p>In addition to the Helio P90, Ulefone also included a lot of RAM inside of this phone. The device includes 8GB of RAM, and that only helps with overall performance. This phone can keep a lot of apps in the background without a problem. It is worth noting that it also comes with 128GB of internal storage.</p>

      <h3>It has a large, 6.3-inch display</h3>
      <p>The Ulefone Armor 7 features a 6.3-inch fullHD+ display with a waterdrop notch. That notch is not large at all, which is a good thing. The phone's display comes with a resolution of 2340 x 1080.</p>
      <h3>A massive 5,500mAh battery and fast charging</h3>
      <p>The Armor 7 includes a huge 5,500mAh battery, and 15W fast wired charging. The phone also includes 10W wireless charging, by the way. Ulefone claims that this battery can keep the phone alive for 550 hours on standby, and 25 hours of talk time.</p>
      <p>The Ulefone Armor 7 is currently available for purchase via AliExpress and Banggood, if you're interested. The phone is now discounted to $379.86, as part of the company's 12.12 promotion event. If you're interested, you can get the phone via the link below.</p>
