      <p>There’s going to be a brand new game in the BioShock series, 2K has confirmed. The next game is early in development at a brand new studio opened by the publisher called Cloud Chamber, which will have offices in Montreal and San Francisco. If you’re expecting any details about the next BioShock then I’m afraid you’re out of luck as the game will take several years to be produced and released. What that pretty much does confirm is that the next BioShock will be released on PS5 and Project Scarlett.</p>
      <p>David Ismailer, President of 2K said the following about the new studio:</p>
      <blockquote>“As we continue growing our product portfolio, we remain inspired by opportunities to invest further in our valuable IP, great people and their collective, long-term potential. BioShockis one of the most beloved, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation*. We can’t wait to see where its powerful narrative and iconic, first-person shooter gameplay head in the future with our new studio team at Cloud Chamber leading the charge.”</blockquote>
      <p>Cloud Chamber’s studio head will be Kelley Gilmore who has previously worked on the Civilization and XCOM games. She also becomes the first female studio lead at 2K. Speaking about Cloud Chamber Kelley had the following to say:</p>
      <blockquote>“We founded Cloud Chamber to create yet-to-be-discovered worlds – and their stories within – that push the boundaries of what is possible in the video game medium.Our team believes in the beauty and strength of diversity, in both the makeup of the studio and the nature of its thinking. We are a deeply experienced group of game makers, including many responsible for <i>BioShock</i>’s principal creation, advancement and longstanding notoriety, and honored to be part of the 2K family as stewards of this iconic franchise.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ken Schachter will be the studio head at the Montreal base of Cloud Chamber. Developers, if you’re interested Cloud Chamber is looking for staff.</p>
