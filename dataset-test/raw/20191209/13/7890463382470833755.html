        <b>Hot on the heels of the newest <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/leagueoflegends/best-league-legends-champion-beginners">League of Legends Champions</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/senna">Senna</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/aphelios">Aphelios</a>‘ arrivals, it looks like we could have an idea who the next Champion heading to LoL’s roster might be – and now, what abilities he’ll have. Following a loot asset hinting that the next character will be ‘Sett,’ players have been sent teasers pointing to what the mysterious hero will have up their sleeves.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A couple of weeks back, <a href="http://www.surrenderat20.net/2019/11/1127-pbe-update-loot-assets-skin-bios.html">Surrenderat20</a> (via <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/players-believe-sett-is-the-next-league-of-legends-champion">Dot Esports</a>) revealed a loot asset called ‘Sett’s calling card’ had appeared in the game as part of the current <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/league-of-legends-patch-924">League of Legends patch 9.24</a> PBE testing cycle. This is reportedly “gained by impressing Sett. Openable on January 14, 2020 at 11:00 PT.”</p>
      <p>Now, players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/e7rtan/new_champion_teaser_arrived_in_my_email/">reporting</a> developer Riot Games has sent them emails containing some teasers about a new Champion. The teasers cover the Champion’s four abilities – W, Q, R, and E – which carry slogans like “Fist, meet face,” “Catch these hands,” and “Bust ‘em up,” and show images of various Champions engaging in a bit of a scuffle. Each image bears the statement: “We know you like to fight. Get ready for a new contender.”</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/first-look-lol-champion-sett-abilities-1297198">Dexerto</a> the emails were sent to LoL players who have played their fair share of Bruisers, Juggernauts, and top laners, which could point to what kind of Champion this new addition will be. While it’s not certain what their abilities might be from the clues given, it looks like strength and physical prowess in combat will likely be their style.</p>
      <p>The teasers could also possibly point to it being Sett, as each image includes what seems to be his calling card.</p>
      <p>Riot Games previously <a href="https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/10/champion-roadmap-october-2019/">announced</a> that a “smokin’ hot new juggernaut” is in the works. Emerging from the Ionian underground, “this new Champion will thrive in the centre of a brawl, laughing as they take hit after hit then furiously punching back, releasing all that stored aggression on their enemies’ faces.”</p>
      <p>The Champion roadmap’s description of the juggernaut includes an <a href="https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/04_Teaser_Two_ywexcon0fojp7b6zndkq.jpg">image</a> of a gladiatorial-style arena, and in it you can see banners depicting what looks like a golden wolf’s head – pretty similar to Sett’s calling card, which you can see below:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The other Champion mentioned in the roadmap turned out to be marksman Aphelios, just arrived on the LoL PBE.</p>
      <p>It’s far from confirmed based on these clues, but it’s looking possible that the new juggernaut Champion could be Sett. Whoever it might be, perhaps they’ll arrive in the game early next year – possibly as part of the game’s first 2020 season patch, due to arrive in January.</p>
      <p>We’ve reached out to Riot for comment and will update the story with any new information.</p>
