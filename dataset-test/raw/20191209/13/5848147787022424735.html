      <h1>Socceroos lose last link to ‘golden generation’ as Milligan retires</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:52:35+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/ed-jackson/" target="_blank">Ed Jackson</a></address>
      <p>The Socceroos have lost the final link to Australia’s ‘golden generation’ with captain Mark Milligan announcing his international retirement.</p>
      <p>One of just two Australians to make four World Cup squads along with Tim Cahill, the 34-year-old told teammates and staff on Monday he was calling time on his Socceroos career.</p>
      <p>Milligan debuted for Australia in a friendly against Liechtenstein in June 2006 and went on to make 80 appearances for his country.</p>
      <p>A member of Australia’s 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cup squads, Milligan also played at three Asian Cups including the successful 2015 tournament on home soil.</p>
      <p>“It has been a privilege to be involved with the Socceroos over the last 14-odd years,” Milligan said.</p>
      <blockquote>To be able to represent my country over that time is above and beyond anything I could have dreamed of.</blockquote>
      <p>“It hasn’t always been smooth sailing – it was always going to be difficult to try and break into a squad full of Australian superstars. But I was given a chance, and just to be involved with players from Australia’s golden generation and learn my trade from them was an absolute gift that I will be forever grateful for.”</p>
      <p>Milligan was appointed Socceroos captain by Graham Arnold following Mile Jedinak’s retirement after the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p>

      <p>He led Australia at this year’s Asian Cup in January but has barely played for his country since that tournament due to niggling injury problems.</p>
      <p>Forced to pull out of the squads to play Kuwait and Jordan in World Cup qualifiers due to injury, Milligan’s last national team appearance was the 5-0 win over Nepal in Canberra in October.</p>
      <p>In his absence Mathew Leckie led the team against Kuwait while goalkeeper Mat Ryan has taken up the armband in the team’s past two qualifiers against Taiwan and Jordan.</p>
      <p>Arnold said Milligan’s unstinting service to the national team, which included the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, should ensure he is remembered as a Socceroos great.</p>
      <p>“I am so proud of Mark and the career that he has had,” Arnold said.</p>
      <p>“Mark’s commitment and desire for Australian football is up there with the best and I feel privileged to have been involved with him at the start and end of his international career.”</p>
      <p>Milligan will continue to play for English League One club Southend United, who he joined in July after being released by Scottish Premiership team Hibernian.</p>
