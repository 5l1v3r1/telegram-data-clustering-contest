        <b>. Played back via a sampler, the sound’s wobbling sped up and slowed down, adding urgency to the  sound. </b>

      <p>Here we look at how to recreate the classic bass patch with Plugin Boutique’s VirtualCZ. </p>

      <p><b>Step 1: </b>Kevin Saunderson’s iconic Reese bass was originally made with a Casio CZ synth. Let’s recreate one using <a href="https://www.pluginboutique.com/">Plugin Boutique’s</a> software emulation, VirtualCZ. Create a new 117bpm project in your DAW and import Beat.wav and Melody.wav. Load an initialised VirtualCZ and trigger it with Reese.mid to get started.</p>

      <p><b>Step 2: </b>It’s easier to program in ADSR mode, so click that button first. Next, set the oscillators in Line 1 to A pulse and B square. Change the Polyphony mode from Polyphonic to Monophonic, which is a more suitable playback mode for a bass patch like this.</p>

      <p><b>Step 3: </b>Let’s shape amplitude. Up the Amp Env’s Decay to around 3.75, Sustain to about 85% and Release to 100ms. The DCW Envelope acts like a filter – bring its Decay to around 130ms, Sustain to 75% and Release to 425 ms. Bring the Depth down to 10%, but turn the Oscillator section’s DCW knob to about 40%.</p>

      <p><b>Step 4: </b>It’s a good sound, but we’re not there yet. Head over to the Pitch Envelope section and make sure Depth is cranked right up. Raise the Velocity to around 2 and then bring up the Sustain slider to about 5%. You should hear the sound’s pitch move up at the end. </p>

      <p><b>Step 5: </b>Now for the final touches. Change the oscillator mix to Line1 + Line1’ to bring out harmonics. Turn up the Fine detune amount – we like it at about 30 (50 cents). Play with the DCW envelope’s Depth, and dial in velocity and key follow for variation.</p>
