      <p>Three months on from the release of their <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-blink-182-nine/">latest album NINE</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/blink-182/">blink-182</a> have just unveiled even more new music: this time, a collaboration with U.S. electronic DJ and production duo The Chainsmokers.</p>
      <p>Their collaborative new single – titled P.S. I Hope You’re Happy – is a part of The Chainsmokers’ third album, World War Joy, and was released alongside new songs with Kygo, Sabrina Claudio and Amy Shark. The pair’s effort with the pop-punk heroes was actually teased all the way back in January, when they tweeted: “Just did a session with blink-182 and wrote an amazing song. We can die happy now.”</p>

      <p>As well as P.S. I Hope You’re Happy, blink-182 may possibly even have more material in the works, as drummer Travis Barker hinted earlier in the year that an EP could also see the light of day soon; the band worked with rappers Lil Uzi Vert and Pharrell during their studio time making NINE.</p>
      <p>“That’s the most mind-blowing thing ever,” he gushed to Kerwin Frost Talks. “It’s gonna come out probably on the EP that comes later this year.”</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/travis-barker-i-looked-death-in-the-face-and-survived/">recent interview with Kerrang!</a>, Travis spoke of his life and career at length. Discussing the pop-punks’ reunion and how it affected him, the drummer said: “I had already accepted that it was over, so when it did come back and we did a reunion tour, that was cool. It was fun to be around <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/tom-delonge/">Tom [DeLonge</a>, former frontman] again, and it was fun to be around Mark again, but I could always kind of feel the vibe that Tom really liked doing his own thing – probably even more so than blink. Whereas I always kept it as a priority, even if I was on tour with Wayne or if I was working with whoever, whatever rapper, whenever I was doing Transplants, whatever people would see me doing. Whenever blink came around, it was always my priority. Tom – and I love him to death – but I felt blink was no longer the priority for him. It was like, ‘Oh, let’s do this reunion tour, but I really want to get back to doing my own thing.’ And I respected that in some ways, and I guess I could see Tom’s focus was somewhere else. Then eventually I felt like I had even more respect for him because he was like, ‘Look, I don’t want to actually do this anymore, and I want to go do this, this and this.’ For him to walk away from such a big monster, a big machine like that, I have nothing but respect.”</p>
      <p>When asked if he still keeps in touch with Tom, Travis responded: “Yeah, I do. We talk, even if it’s only through text, like, ‘Hey, are you cool? How’s the tour?’ I’ll say, ‘Man, everything’s great, and I hope you’re doing good.’ Whatever. It’s just small talk really, but yeah, we definitely keep in touch, just to check in.”</p>
