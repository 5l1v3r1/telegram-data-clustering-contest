      <p>TOKYO: Japan is weighing inviting Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani for a state visit, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday, as local media reported the trip was likely to happen this month.<br/>Japan has been trying to forge a possible mediator role as tensions rise between its ally Washington and Tehran.<br/>Local media has reported in recent days that Rouhani is likely to visit Tokyo around December 20, with some reports saying Washington has green-lighted the trip.<br/>“A visit by President Rouhani to Japan is now under consideration,” Abe said at a press conference marking the end of the year’s parliamentary session.<br/>“Japan, which has an alliance with the US and at the same time has maintained favorable relations with Iran for a long time, must forge its own path,” he said.<br/>“I want to make diplomatic efforts as much as possible to help ease tensions and stabilize the situation in the region by continuing dialogue patiently,” he added.<br/>If the trip is confirmed, Rouhani would become the first Iranian president to visit Japan since 2000.<br/>Japan and Iran have maintained a good relationship despite recent regional turmoil, with resource-poor Japan heavily reliant on imports of oil from the Middle East.<br/>Abe traveled to Iran in June and met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as well as Rouhani. He met Rouhani again in New York during this year’s UN General Assembly.<br/>The proposed visit comes as tensions remain high between Tehran and Washington, despite a prisoner swap last week.<br/>On Sunday, Rouhani announced a “budget of resistance” against US sanctions targeting the country’s vital oil sector.<br/>US President Donald Trump began imposing punitive measures in May 2018, after unilaterally withdrawing from an accord that gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for limits on its nuclear program.</p>
