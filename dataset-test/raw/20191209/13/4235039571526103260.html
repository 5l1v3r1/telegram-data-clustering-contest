      <p>Five people were <b>killed</b> in the eruption of a <b>volcano</b> in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>There are foreigners among the blocked tourists on White Island, but their nationality is still unknown.</p>
      <p>At the time of the sudden eruption of the <b>volcano</b>, there were between 50 and 100 people around the crater, most of them tourists.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the White Island - also known as Whakaari - had erupted along the northern coast of <b>New Zealand</b> while there were groups of tourists in the area.</p>
      <p>St. John's Emergency Services announced that about 20 people were probably injured.</p>
      <p>The island is located about 50 kilometers off the coast of <b>New Zealand</b> in the picturesque Bay of Plenty and is popular among the tourists.</p>
      <p>White Island is the most active <b>volcano</b> in New Zealand. About 70 percent of the <b>volcano</b> is under the sea and at least 10,000 people go to see it every year. It has erupted frequently in the last half-century, with its last eruption in 2016.Â </p>
