      <h3>Ozzy Osbourne offers $25,000 reward for the return of stolen Randy Rhoads gear</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Following the break in and theft of a number of historic pieces of Randy Rhoads gear at the school where he once taught guitar, Ozzy Osbourne has now offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the items return.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The burglary took place during Thanksgiving night (28 November) at the music school in Hollywood that was founded over 70 years ago by Randy's mother Delores. </p>
      <p>Ozzy's statement reads as follows: </p>
      <p>"As many of you have heard, the Musonia School of Music in N. Hollywood, CA (the school where Randy Rhoads famously taught guitar) was viciously robbed on Thanksgiving night.</p>
      <p>"Musonia was run by Randy's late mother, Delores, and after his death 37 years ago, the school became something of a pilgrimage to his fans from all over the world. It is a place where the Rhoads Family happily opened their hearts to share the life of Randy.</p>
      <aside>I am heartbroken that these treasured physical memories of Randy and Delores have been taken from the family so I've decided to personally offer a $25,000 reward</aside>
      <p>"As you can imagine, the items that were stolen, including Randy's first electric guitar, are irreplaceable to the Rhoads Family.</p>
      <p>"I am heartbroken that these treasured physical memories of Randy and Delores have been taken from the family so I've decided to personally offer a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction and/or return of all stolen items.</p>
      <p>"For information regarding the theft or return of these items please contact: Nick D'Argenzio Phone: 818-281-7893 E-mail: nickdargenzio@gmail.com</p>
