      <p>The<b> Nissan Navara N-Trek Warrior</b> has laid out a new challenge to top-end ute rivals – the Ford Ranger Raptor, HSV Colorado SportsCat and Toyota HiLux Rugged X – by launching with a super-sharp drive-away price.</p>
      <p>The Nissan Navara Warrior six-speed manual<b> starts from $62,990 drive-away</b> while the seven-speed auto is <b>$65,490 drive-away</b>. Both prices exclude metallic paint, which adds $550 to grey and white. Black is a no-cost option.</p>
      <p>Unlike other recent drive-away deals on the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/nissan/navara/">Nissan Navara</a>, these prices are not restricted to ABN holders; private buyers can also get the same deal.</p>

      <p>In round numbers <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/nissan-navara-n-trek-warrior/">the Nissan Navara Warrior</a> is $20,000 cheaper than segment pioneer, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/ford-ranger-raptor/">Ford Ranger Raptor.</a></p>
      <p>By comparison, the Ford website shows the Ranger Raptor drive-away prices range from $84,669 (QLD) $84,723 (NT), $85,156 (SA), $85,392 (TAS), $85,575 (NSW), $86,629 (VIC) to $87,397 (WA). The prices vary due to unique stamp duties in each state.</p>
      <p>The Nissan Navara Warrior also undercuts the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hsv/colorado-sportscat/">HSV Colorado SportsCat</a> by between $2000 and $10,000. HSV does not publish national drive-away prices for the Colorado SportsCat.</p>

      <p>However, a quick online search show prices for current model HSV Colorado SportsCat V automatic range from $64,990 drive-away to $72,990 drive-away. Superseded runout models cost between $62,990 and $64,990 drive-away.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Nissan Navara Warrior also covers both sides of the current <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/hilux/">Toyota HiLux Rugged X</a> promotional price of $63,990 drive-away.</p>
      <p>While the Ford Raptor Raptor comes from the Thailand factory ready to roll – with wider bodywork, Fox shocks, uprated brakes, alloy wheels, all-terrain tyres, sports seats and a heavy duty bumper and side steps – the HSV Colorado SportsCat, Toyota HiLux Rugged X and Nissan Navara Warrior are modified locally.</p>
      <p>The HSV Colorado SportsCat has its bodywork, shocks, wheels, tyres and seats designed, engineered and fitted by Holden Special Vehicles in Melbourne before the vehicles are distributed to dealers.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Nissan Navara Warrior follows a similar formula. Melbourne-based engineering firm Premcar, the outfit formerly known as <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/fpv/">Ford Performance Vehicles</a>, did the design and engineering work on the Nissan Navara Warrior and does the final assembly at a facility on the northern outskirts of Melbourne before the cars are trucked to dealers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/toyota-hilux-rugged-x/">The Toyota HiLux Rugged X</a> may be in a similar price range (the current offer is $63,990 drive-away while the normal full retail price is $68,000 drive-away) but it is technically not a direct rival to the Ford Ranger Raptor, HSV Colorado SportsCat and Nissan Navara Warrior as it does not get unique shock absorbers or tyres, and has not increased its footprint or ground clearance.</p>
      <p>As with the Ford Ranger Raptor and HSV Colorado SportsCat, the Nissan Navara Warrior is a permanent part of the Nissan range. However, only the Ford, Toyota and Nissan are available at all dealers; HSVs are still only sold through 65 of Holden’s 200-strong dealer network.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Nissan Australia boss Stephen Lester said the company enlisted the help of Premcar so it could enter the lucrative top-end ute market in much less time than it would take to wait for a factory-built option.</p>
      <p>“We fought very hard to get the price right,” Mr Lester said. “There is so much demand in the ute market just above the $60,000 price range that we had to land there. This is clearly the sweet spot for buyers of top-end utes and we wanted to make this offer available to retail buyers and ABN holders.”</p>
      <p>In a media statement Mr Lester said: “We wanted to produce an Australian-market specific, adventure-oriented vehicle that can cope with our terrain, our climate and our driving expectations, for the booming premium dual-cab ute market. This new top-end segment seeks higher specification, higher capability and higher visibility and is expected to show significant growth in 2020 and beyond.”</p>
