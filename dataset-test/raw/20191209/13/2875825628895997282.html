      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celeb</a> winner <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> has finally broken her silence to update her fans on how she is doing - and her wedding ring is firmly back on.</p>
      <p>The newly-crowned Queen of the Jungle is still in Australia but swerved the afterparty for the show - leaving early after saying a quick hello to her campmates.</p>
      <p>Instead, she opted to spend time with her daughters, Ella, four, and Mia, one, and her husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> .</p>
      <p>Dan was hit by several cheating claims while Jacqueline was in the jungle.</p>
      <p>One came from her campmate Myles Stephenson, who told her he believed Dan had cheated with Myles' ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> .</p>
      <p>Shortly after that, model <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-chloe-ayling-celebrity-big-13077500">Chloe Ayling</a> who starred on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> with him and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-natalie-nunn-celebrity-big-13090053">Natalie Nunn</a> , claimed they had a threesome after a boozy night out.</p>

      <p>Dan has denied both claims, and Gabby has also denied anything happened between them.</p>
      <p>But Jacqueline put on a brave face as she cuddled her daughters and filmed them playing with Dan.</p>
      <p>She thanked her fans for their support, and insisted she was doing well despite the drama.</p>

      <p>It has been the best experience of my whole entire life."</p>
