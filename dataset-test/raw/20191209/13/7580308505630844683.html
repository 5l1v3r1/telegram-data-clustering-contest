      <h1>4.5 magnitude earthquake hits Tuscany, no victims</h1>

      <p>A 4.5 magnitude earthquake hit the central Italian region of Mugello on Monday, sending panicked residents into the streets but causing minimal damage to buildings.</p>
      <p>The quake, centred some 31 km (19 miles) northeast of Florence in Tuscany, hit at 4:37 am (0330 GMT), after a series of smaller quakes, according to the national institute for geophysics and vulcanology (INGV).</p>
      <p>Residents fled their buildings in the rain, congregating outside or in their cars to await authorities.</p>
      <p>“The quake went on for a while, especially the first one, things fell down at a supermarket but for the moment we haven’t seen any damage to people or things,” said Filippo Carla’ Campa, mayor of the town of Vicchio.</p>
      <p>A resident of Barberino del Mugello said his neighbours were panicking getting out of the building.</p>
      <p>“Paintings fell off the walls, bookcases fell over,” he told Rai 24.</p>
      <p>In Barberino del Mugello, the 17th-century church suffered a crack in one side, television images showed.</p>
      <p>Schools were closed in the region and some trains through Florence were cancelled or delayed.</p>
      <p>Italy is frequently struck by seismic activity, often devastating. Most recently, a series of strong quakes hit central Italy in late 2016 and early 2017, killing 300 people.</p>
      <p>In 1919, the area was hit by an earthquake that killed 100 people.</p>
