      <h2>You won't need controllers in certain VR apps.</h2>

      <p>You don't have to wait until 2020 to try <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/27/oculus-quest-hand-tracking-hands-on/">Oculus Quest hand tracking</a>, at least so long as you're willing to accept some limits. Oculus is trotting out the controller-free input method as an option in the "Experimental Features" menu this week. You can only use it in the main interface as well as first-party apps like the web browser and Oculus TV, but that still allows you to ditch the grips for common tasks. You can switch back to controllers through a quick toggle in the home screen.</p>
      <p>The hand tracking test will be available to you once you've updated the Quest to v12.</p>
      <p>Third-party apps with hand tracking won't come until 2020. However, Oculus will offer a development kit next week that will make hands-only control available. The technology won't necessarily make sense in every app. We can imagine it being a particular problem in games where your hands might be out of view of the headset's cameras. It's a start, though, and there may come a time when you only pick up the controllers when you absolutely need them.</p>
