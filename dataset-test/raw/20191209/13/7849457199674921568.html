      <p>For this, Lacson filed Senate Resolution 229 commending and exalting Magno for showing “extraordinary bravery, heroism, and instinct” to fulfill his sworn duty “To Serve and Protect” even at the cost of his own life.</p>
      <p>“Whereas, this selfless act of Police Master Sergeant Jason Magno should be emulated and recognized not only by the Philippine National Police (PNP) but by the entire country,” Lacson said.</p>
      <p>Lacson headed the PNP from 1999 to 2001 during the Estrada presidency.</p>
      <p>“He (Magno) was the best among us. The PNP leadership must lose no time in recognizing this cop’s heroism made more significant by his instinct to save the lives of people he may not even know,” he said.</p>
      <p>Magno, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal specialist of the PNP, along with Police Master Sergeant Alice Balido – both of the Initao Police Station in Misamis Oriental – were the first responders in an incident last November 28, when Ibrahim Ampaso Basher ran amuck at Initao College and endangered the lives of the students, teachers and other civilians.</p>
      <p>Despite Magno’s and Balido’s efforts to subdue Basher, the suspect was still able to lob a grenade at them. Magno instinctively covered the grenade with his own body before it exploded.</p>
      <p>“Had it not been for his bravery, heroism, and instinct to save lives, students, teachers, as well as his fellow policemen would have perished on that fateful day,” Lacson said in his resolution.</p>
      <p>Lacson also noted that Magno, who entered the police force in 2000, had received various medals from the PNP such as the Medalya ng Kagalingan, Medalya ng Kasanayan,  Medalya ng Papuri, Medalya ng Paglilingkod sa Mindanao, and  Medalya ng Paglaban sa Manliligalig.</p>
      <p>PNP Officer-in-Charge Police Lieutenant General Archie Gamboa recently awarded Magno posthumously the Medalya ng Katapangan.</p>
