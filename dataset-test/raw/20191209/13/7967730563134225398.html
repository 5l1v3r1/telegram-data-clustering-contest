      <h1>Bushfire threat fans the flames of anxiety</h1>

      <p>As we wake to another day of smoke-saturated air, the physical health risks of this year’s bushfire season are hard to ignore. But for the roughly one in five of us who experience mental health issues in a given year, there’s also a psychological toll.</p>
      <p>As someone who has been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, I find myself constantly teetering between staying adequately informed and spiralling into a panic when considering the reality that a bushfire could pop up near me at any moment.</p>
      <p>After all, it has happened before.</p>

      <p>Looking back at my grandmother’s home video from Christmas Day, 2001, I see footage of teenage me and my family opening our presents, the vision ominously cloaked in red. All I can think about is how the people on that screen had no idea that the dining table would remain set for several days as a bushfire threatened our small town on the outskirts of Sydney.</p>
      <p>Most of my family, including my 12-year-old brother – who was going through chemotherapy at the time – left Christmas lunch before dessert and headed for the safety of a nearby town, leaving my father and grandfather to defend our home.</p>

      <p>It was an overwhelming experience, and though I remain forever grateful that the outcome was positive – both family and home survived – I just can’t shake the memories of that Christmas. Every time the weather starts to warm and the Fires Near Me app notifications start to pop up on my phone, I once again see red.</p>
      <p>Each day is filled with an almost constant tension. My bushfire plan is always to leave early because I’m not psychologically healthy enough to stay, but I’m well aware that choice may not be mine to make.</p>
      <p>Sydney psychologist Jacqui Manning has witnessed this heightened anxiety during what, by all accounts, is an unprecedented bushfire season.</p>
      <p>"I’ve seen ... a general sense of unease and a general sense of trepidation," she says.</p>
      <p>For those with anxiety, or related mental health issues, Manning suggests that being realistic about concerns can help ease some of the tension.</p>
      <p>"Write your worries down and consider whether there’s something you can do about them; for example, if you’re living in a bushfire-prone area can you take action, like clearing your property.</p>
      <p>"Reminding yourself that you’re doing everything you can to stay safe and preparing enough for any negative consequences of the fire can be really useful."</p>
      <p>It can also help to recognise and utilise the support provided by those working to contain these fires.</p>
      <p>"Know you don’t have to deal with this alone; if you’re worried, ask questions," Manning says. "Even if you have to do it a few times, that’s OK if that’s what you need to reassure yourself."</p>
      <p>Of course, there’s also room for accepting that with natural disasters come natural reactions.</p>
      <p>"We get a bit caught up with trying to be happy all the time, and that’s not realistic, it’s not appropriate either. There’s things we should be worried about, or sad about, but to find the hope as well is a good balance."</p>
      <p>For me, I’ll continue to walk the tightrope of alert and anxious; while counting down the days till the return of cooler weather or rain – whichever comes first.</p>
