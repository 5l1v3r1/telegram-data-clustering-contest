      <h1>Jason Kelce gave a “passionate and emotional speech” during Eagles team meetings this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:47:08+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author">Brandon Lee Gowton</a></address>
      <p>Well, you can’t accuse the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> of keeping things entirely status quo after losing to the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>.</p>
      <p>Doug Pederson changed things up this week by <a href="https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2019/12/5/20997626/eagles-padded-practice-dolphins-game-loss-new-york-giants-nfl-week-14-doug-pederson-players-gimmick">holding padded practices</a> late in the regular season. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_McManus/status/1202687442379296778">challenged the team’s leaders</a> to step up.</p>
      <p>On that last note, one of the Eagles’ five captains was especially vocal at the facility this week. ESPN’s Chris Mortensen (<a href="https://twitter.com/JClarkNBCS/status/1203707002150641665">via John Clark</a>) reports Eagles starting center <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130972/jason-kelce">Jason Kelce</a> gave a passionate and emotional speech to team.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhIFNxEz1qc">Kelce previously delivered the greatest speech in the history of the universe</a> when he stood dressed in a Mummers outfit on the Philadelphia Museum of Art steps during the Eagles’ <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/super-bowl-parade">Super Bowl parade</a> celebration.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Kelce’s most recent speech will motivate the Eagles to come out strong en route to a decisive victory over the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> on Monday Night Football. Maybe we look back at this moment as the turning point when the Eagles went on a run down the stretch to win the NFC East. That’s certainly the goal.</p>
      <p>But it’ll be hard to believe it until we see it. Talk is cheap. It’s time for the Eagles to put up or shut up.</p>
