      <h1>Beyoncé Is Teasing New Ivy Park Merch, So Save Your Pennies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:20:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p>Just in time for you to break your “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/beyonce-beyhive-new-merch-line.html">spend less money</a>” New Year’s resolution, Beyoncé is dropping brand-new Ivy Park <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/shop-beyonce-new-merch.html">merchandise</a> in 2020. The singer teased the items in a series of Instagram posts Monday morning. The collection, out January 18, includes shoes, earrings, rings, bracelets, and potentially apparel, although the photos don’t give us a good look at any clothing. The jewelry has a gold Ivy Park logo, and the bracelets (or anklets) feature thick gold chains. There are also Adidas-logo studs, some with thin chains hanging off. The Queen B herself wears an Ivy Park–logo grill. As for kicks, Beyoncé only teased one pair of sneakers with a neon-orange stripe and Ivy Park logos.</p>

      <p>This Adidas collab has been a long time in the making. Beyoncé bought out Ivy Park from Topshop owner Philip Green last year and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwuX3GJBYyI/?utm_source=ig_embed">announced a collaboration </a>with Adidas in April. Now, we’re finally getting a taste of what she’s been up to. After we all flocked to see that <s>nature documentary</s> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/the-lion-king-2019-review.html"><i>Lion King </i>remake</a>, a little merch is simply what we deserve.</p>
