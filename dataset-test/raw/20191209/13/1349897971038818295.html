        <li>Inter need a result against Barcelona to book their place in the last 16</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inter Milan coach Antonio Conte hopes to lead the Serie A leaders into the Champions League knockout stages when they host Barcelona on Tuesday. </p>
      <p>Barça have already qualified for the last 16 as group winners but Conte played down the importance of that, saying it's "impossible" not to suffer when facing the Catalans. </p>
      <p>"If we think we won’t suffer when Barca are in possession, we would be fools," he said in the pregame press conference. "When we get possession, we will try to put them in difficulties.</p>
      <p>"At Camp Nou (when Barça won 2-1), we played with courage and desire, but the defeat came thanks to their great players. We have grown, some things have changed, we will try to respect them and at the same time limit our opponent.</p>
      <p>“At the draw, they were talking about a very difficult group. Being here, on the last day, with the chance to play against Barcelona, must give us satisfaction and pride.</p>
      <p>“We want to continue to play in this competition, with players who need the experience.&amp;rdquor;</p>
      <p>Inter must match Borussia Dortmund's result against Slavia Prague on Tuesday to ensure they progress to the next stage of the competition. </p>
      <p>They have been boosted by the news that Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique and Sergi Roberto have all been rested for the game. Jordi Alba, Nelson Semedo, Ousmane Dembele and Arthur Melo are all missing through injury, too. </p>
