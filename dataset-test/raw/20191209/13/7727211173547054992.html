      <h1>Boris Johnson pockets reporter's phone to avoid picture of 4-year-old on hospital floor</h1>
      <h2>Prime Minister forced to apologise and return phone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:13:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/liam-thorp/" target="_blank">Liam Thorp</a></address>
      <p>This was the moment Boris Johnson took away the phone of a reporter who was trying to show him an image of a four-year-old boy lying on a hospital floor.</p>
      <p>Shocking images surfaced over the weekend of young <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/people/it-was-chaos-shocking-photo-shows-leeds-four-year-old-suspected-pneumonia-forced-sleep-floor-lgi-due-lack-beds-1334909">Jack Williment-Barr lying down on a coat in Leeds General Infirmary's department</a> after being taken to hospital with suspected pneumonia.</p>
      <p>The image raised more questions and concerns about the state of the NHS after years of under-funding by the Conservative government.</p>
      <p>Today Mr Johnson was confronted with the stark image of young Jack but refused to look at it - instead pocketing the phone of the reporter trying to show him it.</p>

      <p>In a remarkable scene,<a href="https://twitter.com/joepike"> ITV reporter Joe Pike </a>then pointed out on camera that the Prime Minister had effectively confiscated his phone, for which Mr Johnson then was forced to apologise.</p>
      <p>He then reluctantly looked at the image before moving on to talk about why 'getting Brexit done' is the only way to help the struggling health service.</p>

      <p>After his phone was taken, the reporter told the Prime Minister: "You've refused to look at the photo, you have taken my phone and put it in your pocket."</p>
      <p>"His mother says the NHS is in crisis, what do you say to that?"</p>
      <p>The clip shows the Prime Minister then apologising and returning the reporter's phone before admitting it was a "terrible photo".</p>
      <p>He added: "I apologise to the families who have had a terrible experience in our NHS, but what we are doing is supporting the NHS.</p>
      <p>"And on the whole I think patients in the NHS than this poor kid has had."</p>
      <p>He then turned back to his Brexit message, adding: "We are making huge investments in the NHS and the only way we can do that is if we can get Parliament going, unlock the deadlock and move forward."</p>
      <p>Responding to the incident, Labour's shadow health secretary John Ashworth said: "Refusing to even look at an image of a child suffering because of Conservative cuts to the NHS is a new low for Boris Johnson. It’s clear he could not care less.</p>
      <p>"Don’t give this disgrace of a man five more years of driving our NHS into the ground. Sick toddlers like Jack deserve so much better."</p>
