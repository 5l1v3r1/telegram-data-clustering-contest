      <h1>Seven blankets to keep you warm when the winter chill arrives</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:09:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author">Almara Abgarian</a></address>
      <p>Christmas Day is just around the corner but winter still seems far away, as we bask in early springtime temperatures this week.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10080518/">research</a> predicts that the weather will soon be catching up with us, as 2020 could be ‘the coldest winter since January-February 2013’.</p>
      <p>In other words, it’s soon time to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/02/08/why-the-danish-art-of-hygge-is-massively-overrated-6386748/">get your hygge on</a> – and snuggle up indoors with a steaming cuppa and a woolly knit.</p>
      <p>Of course, one must not forget the trusted throw for bedtime. We’ve put together a list of cosy blankets that will keep you warm while the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/08/new-beast-east-hit-uk-coldest-winter-30-years-10706341/">Beast from the East</a> rages on outside.</p>
      <p>And they’re pretty stylish, too.</p>
      <h3>Softly Softly alpaca blanket, £95</h3>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download-8-d58d.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C879&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.softlysoftly.uk.com/product/softly-plain-alpaca-throw-navy/">Softly Softly blanket</a> would definitely make a great luxury present for a friend who’s always cold.</p>
      <p>However, it’s made from 100% organic and sustainable alpaca fur, which could make some shoppers uncomfortable. But it is worth noting that alpaca is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/how-to-make-ethical-knitwear-choices-this-winter-10993196/">generally considered the most ethical wool to purchase</a> (apart from second hand or recycled items).</p>
      <p>As for the feel, it’s pretty warm and also looks nice.</p>
      <p>It’s quite pricey, but the quality will be long-lasting – so it’s a good investment buy. Because of the light-weight feel, it will also pack nicely for upcoming travels during Christmas.</p>
      <h3>The Tartan Blanket Co blanket</h3>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download-7-d1cf.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C765&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>It’s made from recycled wool (Picture: The Tartan Blanket Co)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s only one danger to buying this blanket: that a friend or family member might ‘accidentally’ sneak it with them after a visit.</p>
      <p>We’re not suggesting that your loved ones are thieves, but this blanket is so beautiful we couldn’t blame them.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://tartanblanketco.com/collections/all/products/recycled-wool-blanket-in-bannockbane-silver-tartan">Silver Bannockbane Tartan blanket</a> is also made from 70% recycled wool from India and 30% mixed fibres from landfill, so you can feel good about your purchase.</p>
      <p>This also means that each blanket might look slightly different in colour and design, making each one unique.</p>
      <p>It will keep you toasty warm and because it’s on the smaller size, you can also use it as a scarf.</p>
      <p>The only downside is that the blanket is a tad itchy on naked skin.</p>
      <h3>Zara knit and fleece blanket, £79.99</h3>

        <img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PRI_107931724-e1575895370712.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C683&amp;ssl=1"/>

      <p>If you’re after a fashionable throw with a Scandi-inspired design, here you go.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.zarahome.com/gb/living-room/blankets/knit-and-fleece-blanket-c1089530p301362814.html?ct=true">knit and fleece blanket from Zara Home</a> has two sides; the front is made from 100% acrylic, while the back is 100% polyester – meaning it will feel snug, but also look great draped over your sofa.</p>
      <p>The cream colour is lush, but we wouldn’t recommend this blanket for households with small children. While it’s machine-washable, stubborn stains will be hard to get out, as any form of bleach will ruin the material.</p>
      <p>We like the size, too.</p>
      <h3>Tielle Love Luxury faux fur blanket, £245</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download-6-7d87.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C359&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>It’s like winter heaven (Picture: Tielle Love Luxury)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.tielleloveluxury.co.uk/product/oyster-grey-faux-fur-throw/">Tielle Love Luxury blanket</a> is literally winter heaven.</p>
      <p>It’s weighty and heavy, and OK it’s very expensive for a blanket, but it also provides amazing warmth – so you don’t have to waste money by keeping the heating on super high.</p>
      <p>The faux fur is strokably soft and snuggly, but underneath it has a velvet-like texture, which is ideal if you’re not into getting loads of fluff on your face.</p>
      <p>The deep charcoal colour looks stylish against most bedroom colour-schemes, and draping it over your bed or on the sofa, makes the whole room looks inviting – perfect for hibernation.</p>
      <h3>John Lewis &amp; Partners fleece throw, £12</h3>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PRI_107931664.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=363%2C479&amp;ssl=1"/>

      <p>Warm blankets don’t necessarily have to be expensive, if you choose the right material.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-partners-fleece-throw/mustard/p4343043">fleece throw from John Lewis &amp; Partners</a> might appear a bit thin, but will provide ample warmth, as it’s made from polyester.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t have the luxe feel of some of the other blankets on this list, but it’s very affordable, so you could always buy two and use them at the same time.</p>
      <p>You don’t even need to get the same colour, as it’s available in four shades, including this fetching mustard.</p>
      <h3>H&amp;M ribbed wool-blend blanket, £79.99</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PRI_107931799.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C809&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>The blanket is made with four different materials (Picture: H&amp;M)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The best part about this <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0691219001.html">wool-blend blanket</a> isn’t the cute, ribbed design or the soft feel – though it has that, too – but rather the extensive product description on the website.</p>
      <p>It’s actually made from four materials: acrylic, alpaca, polyamide and wool, and H&amp;M provides details on where these have been sourced, as well as information on the company’s commitment to only work with brands that adhere to their Animal Welfare Policy.</p>
      <p>This way, you can decide for yourself if it fits with your stance on sustainability.</p>
      <h3>Fat Face, £65</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download-9-8ad9.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C540&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>(Picture: Terrys Fabrics)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We love a chunky blanket and this one from Fat Face, <a href="https://www.terrysfabrics.co.uk/products/fatface-sai-throw-charcoal">sold at Terrys Fabrics</a>, is just as cosy as the photo suggests.</p>
      <p>The ‘trapped yarn’ is made with cotton (58%), wool (21%) and acrylic (21%), guaranteed to keep you warm when it starts to snow outside.</p>
      <p>It’s also quite big – ideal for movie nights with friends or a special someone.</p>
