      <h1>Sweden to prosecute ex-China envoy over Gui meetings</h1>

      <p>Sweden's former envoy to Beijing is to go on trial for overstepping her duties by trying to negotiate the release of a Chinese-Swedish dissident held in China, prosecutors in Stockholm said Monday.</p>
      <p>Anna Lindstedt is accused of brokering an unauthorised meeting during her time as ambassador to get publisher Gui Minhai freed, a statement from the prosecutor's office said.</p>
      <p>Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen known for publishing gossipy titles about Chinese political leaders out of a Hong Kong book shop, disappeared while vacationing in Thailand in 2015 before resurfacing in mainland China.</p>
      <p>Lindstedt, who is working as a foreign ministry official without an international posting, could face up to 10 years in jail if convicted.</p>
      <p>"An ambassador is the head of a public authority with a far-reaching mandate to represent Sweden," deputy chief prosecutor Hans Ihrman said.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, even ambassadors had to follow the guidelines set down by the foreign ministry and the government, he added.</p>
      <p>"In this specific consular matter, she has exceeded her mandate and has therefore rendered herself criminally liable," Ihrman said.</p>
      <p>She has been charged with arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power, a first in modern times, he added.</p>
      <p>Relations between Sweden and China have been strained for several years over Gui Minhai's detention.</p>
      <p>Gui Minhai disappeared from a vacation home in Thailand in 2015. Several months later, he appeared on Chinese state television confessing to a fatal drunk driving accident from more than a decade earlier.</p>
      <p>He served two years in prison but three months after his October 2017 release, he was again arrested while on a train to Beijing while travelling with Swedish diplomats.</p>
      <p>His supporters and family have claimed his detainment is part of political repression campaign orchestrated by Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p>According to prosecutors, Lindstedt organised a meeting in January between Gui Minhai's daughter and businessmen with contacts to the Chinese state.</p>
      <p>The Swedish authorities opened their investigation the following month.</p>
      <p>Angela Gui, who has been actively campaigning for her father's release, wrote in February on her blog that Lindstedt had invited her to Stockholm in January.</p>
      <p>During discussions in the lounges of a hotel in the Swedish capital, in the presence of Lindstedt, she was introduced to Chinese businessmen who claimed they could help secure her father's release.</p>
      <p>In exchange, Angela Gui said she was told to "stop all media engagement".</p>
      <p>The Chinese embassy in Stockholm has said Beijing "has never authorised and will not authorise anyone to engage with Gui Minhai's daughter".</p>
      <p>In November, Sweden's Culture Minister Amanda Lind defied a Chinese threat of "counter-measures" by presenting a Swedish rights prize awarded to Gui Minhai.</p>
