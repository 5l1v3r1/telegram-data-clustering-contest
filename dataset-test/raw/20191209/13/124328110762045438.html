      <p>Jacqueline Jossa put her wedding ring back on in a defiant display on Monday after her husband Dan Osborne's alleged cheating scandal. </p>
      <p>The actress, 27, wore the diamond sparkler to celebrate her jungle win with her <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/index.html"><b>I'm A Celebrity</b></a> co-stars after telling her <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/instagram/index.html"><b>Instagram</b></a> followers she is 'absolutely fine'. </p>
      <p>Jacqueline proved she would not let the rumours overshadow her win as she arrived to the bash, held at the Palazzo Versace hotel, with a glass of champagne in hand. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ahead of the celebrations, the soap star took to Instagram to end speculation on her well-being after she dramatically cancelled all interviews- a first in the show's 17-year history. </p>

        <figcaption>Defiant: Jacqueline had her wedding ring back on </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Fans had worried about how Jacqueline would react to Chloe Ayling's claims she and Dan had engaged in a threesome together last year with fellow <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity_big_brother/index.html"><b>Celebrity Big Brother</b></a> star Natalie Nunn.  </p>
      <p>But Jacqueline broke her silence on Instagram. She said: 'Hello everybody. Thank you so much for voting for me. If you voted, it means the absolute world.</p>
      <p>'I cannot quite believe it's happening. I just want to let you all know, I am absolutely fine and it has been the best experience of my whole entire life and my babies are here.'</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Jacqueline became the first winner in the show's history to cancel live TV and newspaper interviews after Chloe Ayling claimed she had a threesome with her husband in 2018- little more than 12-months after the couple exchanged vows.</p>
      <p>There were also reports Myles Stephenson, 28, told Jacqueline his ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen, 25, did have a fling with her husband while they were in the jungle. </p>
      <p>Dan has denied both accusations and hit out at Chloe saying she has no morals. </p>
      <p>Traditionally a key feature on breakfast TV, Lorraine Kelly admitted she would not be interviewing this year's winner while giving viewers a run-down of her daily show on Monday morning.  </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for I'm A Celebrity told MailOnline: 'Jacqueline wants to spend as much time as possible with her family in OZ before they have to travel back to the UK. Plus she's filming Coming Out.' </p>

      <p>Separate sources have since claimed Jacqueline is keen to avoid all publicity - some of which comes with a lucrative fee - opting instead to devote her remaining time in Australia to husband Dan and their two children, Ella, four, and 18-month old Mia.</p>
      <p>'She has to film for the coming out show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family,' an insider told <a href="https://mirror.co.uk/"><b>The Mirror</b></a>.  </p>

      <p>The actress' marriage two-year marriage has been chequered with allegations of Dan cheating on her.  </p>
      <p>In March, Dan denied claims he had kissed Love Island's Alexandra Cane behind Jacqueline's back and a month after that, he also denied a fling with his PR pal Steph Ledigo. </p>
      <p>And in 2015, he spoke of his regret over staying at his ex Megan's house (the mother of his son, Teddy) as this led to cheating rumours. </p>
      <p>Despite a string of allegations against her partner, Jacqueline 'has Dan's back' and believes he's 'an amazing person,' according to a source who spoke to The Sun. </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Stunning: Kate looked incredible as she showed off her bronzed tan in a bright orange midi dress </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'She genuinely believes Dan and will always have his back. She accepts who she's with and where she's at, her marriage vows meant something to her and she thinks he's an amazing person,' they told the publication. </p>
      <p>The same close friend told The Sun that Jacqueline doesn't entertain the rumours, saying that she's grown a 'thick skin' about it. </p>
      <p>They added: 'You have to remember that all of Jacqueline’s relationship with Dan has been surrounded by negativity since the very beginning – Dan's ex Megan was pregnant when they got together and there was constant attention and speculation.' </p>

      <p>James and Caitlyn, 70, bonded during their time in the jungle, starting on day one when the rugby player chose the former Olympic athlete to partner up with for the first challenge.    </p>
      <p>While there were more than a few squabbles in the jungle over the last few weeks, the celebrities had clearly put it all behind them as they enjoyed their remaining time in Australia together before returning home. </p>

      <p>He wrote: 'I could not think of a more deserving winner!! @jacjossa smashed this on so many levels. She was inspirational and dealt with every challenge like a hero. She looked after me in camp like a sister. </p>
