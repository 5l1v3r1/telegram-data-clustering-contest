      <p>LONDON â€” Prime Minister Boris Johnson snatched a reporter's phone after the reporter tried to show him a picture of a 4-year-old boy who was forced to sleep on a hospital floor.</p>
      <p>The prime minister refused to look at the photo, grabbed the reporter's phone, and put it in his pocket for part of the interview.</p>
      <p>The boy, Jack Williment-Barr, was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/little-boy-pneumonia-forced-sleep-21053225">reportedly forced to lie on a pile of coats in a hospital in Leeds</a> while <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-50713236">waiting for more than four hours to be seen</a> earlier this month. He was thought to have pneumonia.</p>
      <h3>Watch the footage of Johnson:</h3>

      <p>Johnson said he had "every sympathy" for the child, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/little-boy-pneumonia-forced-sleep-21053225">whose picture was published by the Daily Mirror on Sunday</a>, but didn't look at the photo and then took the phone from ITV News' Joe Pike and put it in his pocket.</p>
      <p>After being pushed repeatedly by Pike, Johnson looked and said, "It's a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family."</p>

      <p>Responding to the footage, Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: "Refusing to even look at an image of a child suffering because of Conservative cuts to the NHS is a new low for Boris Johnson. It's clear he could not care less.</p>
      <p>"Don't give this disgrace of a man five more years of driving our NHS into the ground. Sick toddlers like Jack deserve so much better."</p>
