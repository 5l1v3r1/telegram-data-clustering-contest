      <h2>Rude not to...</h2>

      <p>Christmas has just come early at Aldi - the budget supermarket has slashed the price of its Prosecco to just £3.99 a bottle.</p>
      <p>Customers at the German budget supermarket, which has stores all over Devon and Cornwall, can pick up a bottle of Aldi's Prosecco for just £3.99 right now.</p>
      <p>The supermarket cut the price of its festive fizz on Friday, December 6, so customers can now snap up a bottle of <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/castellore-prosecco-frizzante-doc/p/075271262832001">Costellore Prosecco Frizzante DOC</a>  at a  bargain price, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/aldi-cuts-price-prosecco-just-17376958?_ga=2.58131695.496689900.1575889186-333566187.1575631828">reports Birmingham Live.</a></p>
      <p>It contains a 10.5% alcohol by volume (ABV) and comes in a 75cl bottle - which provides around six servings.</p>

      <p>Whilst the Prosecco is currently sold out online, Aldi has more than 830 stores in the UK where you could potentially buy one - but we'd advise calling up your nearest store to check if it's available before making a trip.</p>
      <p>The offer won't be around for long, though, so you'll need to be quick if you want to get your hands on a bottle in time for Christmas and New Year.</p>
