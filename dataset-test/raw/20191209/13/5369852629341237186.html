      <h2>Donegal star Geraldine McLaughlin caught the eye, as did recently-retired Kerry ace Sarah Houlihan and Dublin’s Lauren Magee.</h2>

      <p>DONEGAL STAR FORWARD Geraldine McLaughlin dominated the first-ever women’s AFL Europe Combine in Dublin this weekend. </p>

      <p>McLaughlin — widely regarded as one of the best ladies football forwards in the country — was the fastest of the 13 players on trial, in the both the 20m sprint (3.22 seconds) and agility test (8.56 seconds), <a href="https://womens.afl/news/39449/gaelic-star-dominates-first-ever-women-s-afl-europe-combine">as per the AFL’s official website.</a></p>
      <p>Those times would have placed the 26-year-old second in each test at October’s NAB AFLW Draft Combine in Melbourne, and understandably immediately put her on AFLW recruiters’ radars for the 2021 season. </p>
      <p>With lists closed and <a href="https://www.the42.ie/aflw-explainer-irish-players-4870575-Oct2019/">18 Irishwomen ready to go for the 2020 season</a>, none of the hopefuls were in a position to be signed this weekend.</p>

      <p>Though lethal forward McLaughlin — a 2014 All-Ireland club champion with Termon and two-time Team of the League award recipient — has surely raised interest Down Under, with her kicking skills impressing former Carlton star Ciaran Byrne.</p>
      <p>The Louth man “now oversees the women’s Australian Football development programme in Ireland,” according to the AFL website.</p>
      <p>Another star forward, <a href="https://www.the42.ie/sarah-houlihan-amanda-brosnan-4899333-Nov2019/">recently-retired Kerry ace Sarah Houlihan</a> also caught the eye as she registered a Combine-best level 18 in the YoYo Test (that would have comfortably won the Australian Combine).</p>

      <p>Dublin All-Star Lauren Magee, Meath ace Vicki Wall — who flew out to the Melbourne trial with Olivia Divilly and Saoirse Noonan — and Roscommon’s Jenny Higgins were among others to impress.</p>
      <p>Several ladies football stars have landed deals through talent-spotting agency CrossCoders, with the AFL now hoping to get involved with overseas recruitment directly.</p>
