      <p>A spokeswoman said: 'There was a brief disagreement between the suspect and the victim, following which the suspect has started to repeatedly punch the victim in the face, causing him to fall to the ground where the suspect continued to punch him to the face.'</p>
      <p>The victim is described as 6 ft tall with short brown hair.</p>
