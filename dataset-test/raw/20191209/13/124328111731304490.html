      <p>A man has been arrested after scrawling a message about Jeffrey Epstein on awall at Miami's Art Basel - in the same spot where a $120,000 duct-taped banana exhibit was displayed.  </p>
      <p>Roderick Webber, 46, from Massachusetts, was swiftly taken away by police after writing in red lipstick: 'Epstien (sic) didn't kill himself.'</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old wrote the message on a wall at the gallery where a banana had previously been displayed been on display. </p>
      <p>The work of art, by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and titled 'Comedian', sold to a French collector for $120,000. But it was later taken down due to 'several uncontrollable crowd movements' and after a man walked up to the taped piece of fruit banana and ate it. </p>

      <p>Webber's message alluded to the conspiracy theories surrounding the death of the billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein who committed suicide in his New York jail cell in August. </p>
      <p>Many believe his death may have been arranged by others implicated in a global pedophile ring who would have been outed if Epstein went to trial.</p>
      <p>The phrase 'Epstein didn't kill himself' went viral after his death, although Webber failed to spell the name of the disgraced financier correctly. </p>
      <p>Curators later covered up the message with a piece of white cardboard, according to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/visual-arts/art-basel/article238176479.html"><b>The Miami Herald</b></a>.   </p>

      <p>Webber shouted as he was escorted out of the Miami Beach convention center: 'If someone can eat the $120,000 banana and not get arrested, why can't I write on the wall?</p>
      <p>'This is the gallery where anyone can do art, right?' </p>
      <p>On Saturday, David Datuna, who describes himself as a Georgian-born American artist living in New York, walked up to a banana that had been duct-taped to the gallery wall and ate it.</p>
      <p>The banana was, in fact, a work of art by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan titled 'Comedian' and sold to a French collector for $120,000. </p>

        <figcaption>The message was written in red lipstick on the wall after the banana was removed due to crowd safety</figcaption>

      <p>'Art performance ... hungry artist,' Datuna said, as he peeled the fruit and took a bite. 'Thank you, very good.'</p>
      <p>A few bystanders could be heard giggling before a flustered gallery official whisked him to an adjoining space for questioning.</p>
      <p>'He did not destroy the art work. The banana is the idea,' Lucien Terras, director of museum relations for Galerie Perrotin, told the Miami Herald.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, the value of the work is in the certificate of authenticity, the newspaper said. The banana is meant to be replaced.</p>

      <p>A replacement banana was taped to the wall about 15 minutes after Datuna's stunt but was then taken down due to 'several uncontrollable crowd movements'.</p>
      <p>Art Basel is an international art fair selling the works of established and emerging artists.</p>
      <p>It also made headlines on Friday when Madonna's daughter Lourdes 'Lola' Leon stripped down to just a nude thong and pasties to simulate an orgy. </p>
      <p>The half-Cuban 23-year-old wound up in a pile of around 30 others for the Love Different 2020 performance at The Temple House in Miami Beach.  </p>
