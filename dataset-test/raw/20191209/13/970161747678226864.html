      <p>A TV reporter has hit out at a creepy marathon runner who left her lost for words after groping her live on air.</p>
      <p>Alexandrea Bozarjian was assaulted while covering a race in Savannah, Georgia, on Saturday morning for local TV station WSAV.</p>
      <p>A man in sunglasses could be seen smirking as he violated the young journalist, who was stunned into momentary silence by the incident.</p>
      <p>Bozarjian has since taken to Twitter to hit out at her attacker, saying: ‘To the man who smacked my butt on live TV this morning: You violated, objectified, and embarrassed me.</p>
      <p>‘No woman should EVER have to put up with this at work or anywhere!! Do better.’</p>

      <p>She wrote the comment above a video shared by another tweeter called Tonya who branded Bozarijan’s attacker a ‘jerk.’</p>
      <p>Savannah Police Department said they have since been in touch with Bozarjian, and are waiting to see whether she would like to take formal action against him.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Keturah Greene told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-reporter-groped-live-television-participant-running-event-n1097771">NBC News</a>: ‘We’ve talked to her about the situation. I can’t discuss it further, but it’s up to Alexandrea on how she wants to handle the situation.</p>
      <p>‘All I can say is we have made contact with Alexandrea and we are definitely going to be working with her in any capacity on how she’d like to move forward with this incident.’</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Savannah Sports Council, which organizes the city’s marathon, says the groper – who has not been identified – has been banned from all future races.</p>
