      <h1>Concern for Man City as doubts emerge over Pep Guardiola’s future</h1>

        <b>Reports claim that Man City have reportedly started to plan for life after Pep Guardiola as doubts have emerged over his future at the Etihad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s been a difficult season thus far for the reigning Premier League champions as they sit well off the pace set by table-topping Liverpool, while they’ll hope to secure success in domestic cup competitions and the Champions League to secure major trophies this year.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>However, it’s now reported by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-city-planning-life-without-21056335">The Mirror</a>, via the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1440713/2019/12/09/ornstein-on-monday-city-planning-for-life-after-pep-koscielny-and-ozils-goodbyes-to-emery-and-contract-talks-for-leicesters-maddison-and-soyuncu/">Athletic</a>, that given Guardiola has never spent more than four seasons at one club as a coach, this could now mark the end of his time at Man City if he sticks to the trend and decides it’s time for either a break or a new challenge elsewhere.</p>
      <p>It’s suggested that City are considering candidates to fill a backroom role, and that in turn has led to claims over whether they are perhaps planning for Guardiola to move on and have a contingency plan in place to ensure that they’re prepared for that in the summer.</p>
      <p>Time will tell if an exit materialises as Guardiola has seemingly insisted throughout his tenure at the Etihad that he has no plans of moving on in the near future.</p>
      <p>Whether or not failure to win trophies this season influences that decision and perhaps forces him to consider a change of heart remains to be seen. If that is the case, that will surely be a huge boost for Man City’s rivals given the impact he has had in Manchester since his arrival having overseen further success for the club which included a domestic treble last season.</p>
