        <b>BioShock publisher 2K has formed an all-new studio to create BioShock 3.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Called Cloud Chamber, this new team is described to us as a team of storytellers that has begun work on the next iteration of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/bioshock-the-collection-coming-to-xbox-one-and-pc-on-september-13/">the acclaimed BioShock franchise</a>, which will be in development for the next several years.</p>
      <p>The team will be split between two locations: 2K’s San Francisco Bay Area headquarters in Novato, California and a new studio in Montréal, Québec. This will be 2K’s first ever Canadian-based studio.</p>
      <p>22-year industry veteran Kelley Gilmore will serve as Cloud Chamber’s Global Studio Head. Gilmore also has the title of 2K’s first woman in 2K history to lead a development studio.</p>
      <p>With more than two decades of experience in the industry, Gilmore has shipped more than 40 games. Her previous experience includes Firaxis Games’ franchises such as <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/civ-5-designers-new-project-at-the-gates-releases-very-soon/">Sid Meier’s Civilization</a>® and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xcom-2-now-xbox-one-x-enhanced/">XCOM</a>®.</p>
      <p>“We founded Cloud Chamber to create yet-to-be-discovered worlds – and their stories within – that push the boundaries of what is possible in the video game medium,” Gilmore said in a Cloud Chamber press release. “Our team believes in the beauty and strength of diversity, in both the makeup of the studio and the nature of its thinking. We are a deeply experienced group of game makers, including many responsible for BioShock’s principal creation, advancement and longstanding notoriety, and honored to be part of the 2K family as stewards of this iconic franchise.”</p>
      <p>“As we continue growing our product portfolio, we remain inspired by opportunities to invest further in our valuable IP, great people and their collective, long-term potential,” said David Ismailer, President of 2K. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8lngIFXRi4">BioShock</a> is one of the most beloved, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation. We can’t wait to see where its powerful narrative and iconic, first-person shooter gameplay head in the future with our new studio team at Cloud Chamber leading the charge.”</p>
