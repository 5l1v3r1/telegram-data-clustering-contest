      <h1>Turn Your Face Into a GIF With Snapchat Cameos</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:15:56+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Snapchat is reportedly testing a <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/snapchat-debuts-weird-aging-ar-lens-for-app-users-1811469/">feature</a> that essentially lets users insert themselves into GIFs.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/snapchat-animates-selfies-with-3d-effects-1804375/">social network’s</a> video alternative to Bitmoji, Snapchat Cameos uses selfies to replace other people’s faces in animations.</p>
      <p>Following a trial run in France, Snap today announced the Dec. 18 global launch of Cameos on iOS and Android, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/08/snapchat-cameo-edits-your-face-into-videos">as reported by TechCrunch</a>.</p>
      <p>The news site’s Josh Constine got his hands on the forthcoming function, which turned his smiling face into a personalized meme.</p>
      <p>“Snapchat has made 150 short looping video clips with sound that you can choose from with new ones coming each week,” he wrote in a blog post. “They can show you flaunting your cash, dancing like crazy, falling asleep, and tons more.”</p>

      <p>Simply take a selfie to teach the app what you look like (try not to smile); Snap automatically applies your photo to actors’ heads in various GIFs.</p>
      <p>Whether starring in your own looping animation or sharing the spotlight with friends (activate two-person Cameos), you can search for specific words and phrases or browse categories to find the right clip for the moment.</p>
      <p>Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp have copied Snap’s Stories to great success.</p>
      <p>But, as Constine pointed out, Snap may have taken its own Cameos inspiration from Chinese social platform Zao, which let users <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/watch-deepfake-hollywood-roundtable-gets-weird-1810867/">Deepfake</a> their faces into videos.</p>
      <p>In an effort to keep ahead of the chatting curve, Snapchat has begun monetizing messaging, and may even sell sponsored, branded Cameos clips to advertisers, TechCrunch said.</p>
      <p>Snap did not immediately respond to Geek’s request for comment.</p>
