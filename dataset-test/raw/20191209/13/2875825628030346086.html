      <h1>Cheltenham Festival pointers we learned from the weekend's horse racing action</h1>
      <h2>There was plenty of quality action on Saturday and Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:40:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/eamon-doggett/" target="_blank">Eamon Doggett</a></address>
      <p>Another fantastic weekend of jump racing action and plenty of clues for the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
      <p>The highlight must be Defi Du Seuil holding off the remarkable Un De Sceaux to win the Tingle Creek - this year's Champion Chase could be a compelling watch.</p>
      <p>And at Punchestown on Sunday, Min was given a scare by Hardline but his class prevailed in the John Durkan Chase.</p>
      <p>Here is what we learned with a view to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cheltenham-festival">the Cheltenham Festival</a> in March:</p>
      <h3>Perfect pipe opener for Presenting Percy</h3>

      <p>A lot was made of Presenting Percy's preparations for last year's Cheltenham Gold Cup.</p>
      <p>But it is easy to forget that the winner Al Boum Photo only had a single run too before the Cotswolds albeit his was over fences.</p>
      <p>The rain has returned this year though and Presenting Percy looked to have retained if not all of his ability when a strong finishing third to Min over two and half miles in the John Durkan Chase on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Pat Kelly's horse is likely going to rock up at Leopardstown at Christmas and could confirm himself as the most talented staying chaser around.</p>
      <p>Go back to his RSA Chase win a few seasons back and in a distant third that day was Elegant Escape with Frodon even further back in fifth - form that continues to be franked.</p>
      <p>The 14/1 on offer in places for the Gold Cup looks very good each-way value.</p>
      <h3>Glenloe must be watched closely</h3>

      <p>Remember Glenloe in the 2018 Pertemps Network Handicap Hurdle?</p>
      <p>The JP McManus horse was very well backed into favouritism and travelled like the winner before a last flight blunder saw him beaten a nose behind subsequent Grade 1 winner Delta Work.</p>
      <p>Since then he has barely made a ripple on the track after changing his attention to fences.</p>
      <p>It was definitely eye-catching though how he came a never threatening third, jumping soundly and running a good race, in the Foxrock Handicap Chase at Navan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The suspicion is that he is being primed for a big handicap chase and that may well be at the Cheltenham Festival - watch him closely.</p>
      <h3>Goshen could be a bit special</h3>

      <p>It could be premature to be getting involved in the Triumph Hurdle market at this early stage with the likes of Nicky Henderson and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/willie-mullins">Willie Mullins</a> likely to have a few tricks up their sleeves.</p>
      <p>But the startling performances of Goshen can't be ignored. The three-year-old has won his last five races on the flat and over hurdles and the winning margins have been 12, 9, 7, 23 and 34 lengths respectively.</p>
      <p>The latest 34-length win came last Friday at Sandown despite travelling very keenly and not hurdling with much fleuncy.</p>
      <p>You can question the level of opposition but there is clearly a big engine there and the 10/1 about the Triumph Hurdle could be a big price come March.</p>
