      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/North_Korea/?tps=1">North Korea</a> warned the United States on Monday that it has "nothing to lose," following a tweet from President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>On Sunday morning following reports North Korea had conducted a "very important test" at its Sohae satellite launch station, Trump suggested in a tweet the North Korean leader should be careful about next steps.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kim_Jong_Un/?tps=1">Kim Jong Un</a> is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way. He signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement with me in Singapore," Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1203695081376690177">tweeted</a>. "He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere..."</p>
      <p>North Korea replied to the tweet on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kim_Yong/?tps=1">Kim Yong</a> Chol, the top North Korean negotiator who met with Trump at the White House and was identified as chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, suggested Trump lacked awareness of the issues.</p>
      <p>"Trump knows so little about [North Korea]," Kim said. "We are a people who now have nothing to lose."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kim_Young/?tps=1">Kim Young</a> Chol added, "Trump seems to be very nervous. He is a careless and spiteful old man; a time when we'll have to call him a 'senile dotard' could come again."</p>
      <p>North Korea has increased its <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/12/06/Dotage-of-a-dotard-War-of-words-heats-up-between-US-North-Korea/7741575625004/">war of words</a> targeting the Trump administration since the breakdown of talks in Sweden in October.</p>
      <p>The latest message from Pyongyang came the same day South Korean President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Moon-Jae/?tps=1">Moon Jae</a>-in in Seoul met with <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/U2_s_Bono/?tps=1">U2's Bono</a>, KBS reported Monday.</p>
      <p>Bono reportedly thanked Moon for making peace a reality, a reference to Moon's pro-engagement policy with the North that began in 2018.</p>
      <p>Moon said music plays a critical in the peace process; Bono agreed "music is powerful" and that musicians of the North and South could play a role in the peace process.</p>
      <p>Earlier over the weekend Moon exchanged a 30-minute phone call with Trump following North Korea's claimed test. The South Korean president did not hold his regular meetings of senior aides on Monday, according to KBS.</p>
