      <p>One of the most well-received narrative-driven shooter series is getting another entry, with 2K <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191209005224/en/">today announcing</a> the return of <i>BioShock</i>. The new game will be built by Cloud Chamber, a newly set up studio made specifically for developing the game.</p>
      <p>The original <i>BioShock </i>(2007) and <i>BioShock Infinite</i> (2013) were developed by the now defunct Irrational Games under Ken Levine, while <i>BioShock 2</i> arrived from 2K Marin. It's unclear if the new game will be a reboot, or set in the same universe (or the multiverse) built by the previous games.</p>
      <p>2K president David Ismailer had this to say regarding the new development:</p>
      <blockquote>"BioShock is one of the most beloved, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation. We can’t wait to see where its powerful narrative and iconic, first-person shooter gameplay head in the future with our new studio team at Cloud Chamber leading the charge.”</blockquote>
      <p>Cloud Chamber's development teams will be split between San Francisco and Montreal, with Kelley Gilmore leading them as Global Studio Head. She has previously worked on the <i>XCOM </i>and <i>Civilization </i>franchises of Firaxis Games.</p>
      <p>The unnamed <i>BioShock </i>title should still be in early phases of development, meaning we shouldn't expect any more information to arrive for perhaps years.</p>
