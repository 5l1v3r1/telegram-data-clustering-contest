      <h1>Is Dakota Johnson Sick Of Gwyneth Paltrow?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:49:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>Is Dakota Johnson sick of Gwyneth Paltrow? A new report by Star magazine suggests that things aren’t as wonderful between Dakota and Gwyneth as they appear. Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay singer Chris Martin were married from 2003 until 2016 and the uncoupled parents of two children get along excellently. Now that Gwyneth has married Brad Falchuk and Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson are a couple, they have been spotted going on couples’ dates! Some can’t understand why Dakota is agreeing to spend so much time with her man’s ex and now a source is saying that Dakota isn’t enjoying it any longer and wants some alone time for just her and Chris.</p>
      <p>It’s understandable that when you date someone who has children with their ex that it is important to do whatever you can to ensure you get along well for the children’s sake. Dakota and Chris have done this but if what Star is reporting is true, it may be time for Dakota to put her foot down and say enough is enough.</p>
      <p>Star magazine’s source stated the following.</p>
      <blockquote>“Dakota finds all of this ‘Awesome Foursome’ stuff phony and staged. She plays nice with Gwyneth, but find her so nosy and annoying. This is Dakota putting her foot down and telling Gwyneth she won’t tolerate any more meddling.”</blockquote>
      <p>Gwyneth shared an Instagram post on Dakota Johnson’s birthday where she referred to the 30-year-old as an ‘absolute gem.’</p>
      <p>You may see a report about one of Gwyneth’s and Dakota’s double dates below.</p>

      <p>In addition to going on dates together, the foursome has celebrated holidays together as well. This type of relationship with exes isn’t typical and Dakota may feel she wants to create her own holidays with Chris Martin.</p>
      <p>Though no one knows exactly what is going on with Gwyneth and Chris Martin, this type of closeness could be a form of control and manipulation. By trying to be super close and celebrate holidays together, it’s almost a way of not letting the ex move on with his or her life and still overseeing what they do.</p>
      <p>What do you think? Should there be boundaries set where Dakota Johnson doesn’t have to feel that a relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow is part of a relationship with Chris Martin? Do you think this is an ideal situation?</p>
