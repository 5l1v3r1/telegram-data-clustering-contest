      <h1>Scientist Replicates Mars' Conditions in Chamber, Finds That Life Thrives</h1>
      <h2>The scientist created what he calls a "Martian chamber", with the exact conditions as the Red Planet.</h2>

      <p>Mars has often been thought of as a plan B planet with entrepreneurs like Elon Musk making <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/elon-musk-wants-to-drop-nuclear-bombs-on-mars-to-prep-it-for-humans">ambitious plans</a> to colonize the Red Planet. NASA has even flirted with the idea, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-releases-plan-outlining-next-steps-in-the-journey-to-mars/">releasing</a> a strategy for human exploration and colonization of Mars in 2015.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, there's been no proof that the celestial body could actually <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/life-on-mars-scientists-are-a-little-closer-to-solving-the-methane-mystery-on-mars">sustain life</a>. Now, according to Amazon Prime’s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrows-World-Today/dp/B07G5RCCX1">Tomorrow’s World</a></i>, a scientist has replicated Mars' conditions in a chamber to test whether life could indeed survive on the planet.</p>
      <h3>Thriving on the Red Planet</h3>
      <p>What he found was that life not only survived, it thrived. Dr. Jean-Pierre Paul De Vera, of the German Spatial Research Centre in Berlin, created what is called a "Martian chamber" to test the living conditions on the Red Planet.</p>
      <p>In this amazing invention, the "temperature, atmospheric pressure, chemical composition, UV rays," and more of Mars were recreated and regulated with precision to match the planet's real conditions.</p>
      <p>In 2012, DeVera began by testing how long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> could survive in the chamber. He found that the phylum lasted several weeks with no complications.</p>
      <p>He then extended his experimentation to using microorganisms from <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/9-unbelievable-facts-about-antarctica-that-will-chill-you-to-the-bone">Antarctica</a>. These organisms also thrived in the Martian chamber.</p>
      <h3>Complex organisms</h3>
      <p>“From what we’ve seen, the results we’ve had, it would be possible to find life there, or terrestrial life, microorganisms could survive on Mars," said De Vera in Amazon's show.</p>
      <p>“It’s impressive, we never imagined these results, especially with more complex organisms. They are not bacteria, they’re organisms, which use photosynthesis. Life is possible on Mars, and Mars can be a habitat for organisms that live on Earth," he added.</p>
      <p>Although this is promising news for humanity, it must be noted that actually <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/elon-musk-just-unveiled-plans-to-land-cargo-ships-on-mars-as-early-as-2022">getting to Mars</a> and then making the planet livable is well beyond our reach at the moment. As such, it is best not to count on plans B and work our hardest to save the planet we are on right now.</p>
