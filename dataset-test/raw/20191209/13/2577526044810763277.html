      <h1>PUBG's New 'Inner Blue Zone' Could Mean the End of Campers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:13:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>It’s been two and a half years since the battle royale really took off, but PUBG Corp thinks it’s finally found a way to prevent its game’s greatest scourge - campers. In a <a href="https://www.pubg.com/2019/12/05/pubg-labs-bluehole-mode/">blog post</a> last week, the <i>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</i> developer told players that “land, loot, and camp in the circle for the rest of the match is no more.”</p>
      <p>That’s thanks to the arrival of a new Blue Zone. Cleverly named the “Inner Blue Zone”, it’ll “be both a camping deterrent and an indicator of where the next circle will be.” Inner zones will appear from the start of the match until the penultimate phase of the game, and will deal damage at the same rate as the outer zone.</p>
      <p>PUBG Corp said that it’s trying out the new zone because “players didn’t know where the next circle would be, so whoever was lucky enough to be in the next circle had a higher chance of winning,” and that “as the next circle location was unknown, players could often find themselves fighting with the Blue Zone more than their foes.”</p>
      <p>The new system underwent testing over the weekend. If it does make its way to the full game, it’ll likely be a few weeks until we see it again, but I’ll be interested to see what impact it has on the game as a whole.</p>
