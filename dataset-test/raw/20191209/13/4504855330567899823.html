      <p>(WSVN) - December’s full moon is often referred to as the Cold Moon. No, that doesn’t mean it’ll change colors or guarantee cold temperatures.</p>
      <p>Some Native American tribes gave it the name because it lands around the start of the winter season.</p>
      <p>This month’s moon will enter its full phase on Dec. 12 at 12:12 a.m. EST, according to the <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-december#">Old Farmer’s Almanac</a>.</p>
