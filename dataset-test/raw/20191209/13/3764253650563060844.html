      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>The following are the <a href="https://www.zeebiz.com/technology/news-vivo-u20-review-a-competent-contender-on-the-budget-battleground-115146">hardware components</a> that make the phone stand out.</p>
      <h4>Design</h4>
      <p>The upgrades on this phone give it a sleek look. The phone's design is generally shiny, thanks to its plastic back panel as well as the frame that give it a glossy finish. While it comes in two colours, a black and blue shade, the choice one makes is purely banked on their preference.</p>
      <p>Its <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a> and volume buttons are found on the right. The SIM tray is on the left whereas its 3.5 mm jack, the charging port as well as speaker grille are located at its bottom. With a weight of approximately 193 grams, some people may conclude that it is a bulky and heavy device.</p>
      <p>It has a back fingerprint scanner that works well. However, one needs to stretch to get to it. The triple rear camera module with a protective covering is housed by the back panel.</p>

      <p>The phone has a screen-to-body ratio of 84.4%. It has thin bezels because of the waterdrop notch for the front camera. It has a 6.53-inch IPS LCD panel that is bright from all angles. It also comes with a full-HD+ panel, which is an upgrade on its display.</p>
      <h4>Processor, storage &amp; performance</h4>
      <p>The phone uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor coupled with 6GB/4GB RAM. Both variants of the phone come with a ROM of 64GB, which is quite sufficient for ordinary use. If you need more space, then you can bank on the card slot.</p>
      <p>Gamers can rest easy knowing that they can enjoy smooth multi-tasking. However, you have to be okay with the fact that the phone will get hot with prolonged use.</p>
      <p>The device includes an Ultra Game mode which include features such as off-screen Autoplay. This means that you can have a game running even when the display is switched off. You also have the option of blocking notifications. You also do not have to worry about answering your call when in this mode. You can use the free hand mode to receive calls and reduce interruptions.</p>
      <h4>Battery</h4>
      <p>One of the biggest highlights of this phone is its 5,000mAh battery. It comes boxed with an 18W Dual-Engine fast charger. This guarantees you 30 to 36 hours when used on medium to high. Even if you exhaust your battery life, you can be consoled by the fact that the phone charges pretty fast too.</p>
      <h4>Speaker &amp; call quality</h4>
      <p>The phone has a loudspeaker together with a 3.5mm headphone jack complete with the active noise cancellation with dedicated mic feature.</p>
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>Software components determine how great a phone is in terms of functionality. Here are the most crucial ones for the Vivo U20.</p>
      <h4>OS &amp; features</h4>
      <p>The phone runs on a Funtouch OS 9.2 on top of the Android 9 Pie. It also has a couple of pre-installed apps that may be considered bloatware. Seeing that this is not the usual OS most users are accustomed to, it is possible that they experience some difficulties at first. Some of the common apps to expect include EasyShare, Gaana, GameCenter, Amazon Shopping, Dailyhunt, Opera and Helo among others. Not to worry though, you can always uninstall the ones you do not need to minimize the number of notifications you get.</p>
      <h4>Vivo U20 camera, video, and image quality</h4>
      <p>As usual, the manufacturer did not slack off when it comes to camera quality. The device has a triple rear camera consisting of one 16-megapixel primary camera. It has a Sony IMX499 sensor. The device also has a second camera, an 8-megapixel super-wide-angle camera, as well as a third one which is a 2-megapixel macro camera, used to take large images. The selfie camera is a 16MP single camera.</p>
