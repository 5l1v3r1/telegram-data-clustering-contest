      <h1>I'm A Celeb winner Jacqueline Jossa is 'fine' as she 'cancels live TV interviews</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:03:12+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Deen</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here! winner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> is ‘fine’ after being crowned queen of the jungle.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline triumphed over Coronation Street star Andy Whyment and DJ Roman Kemp in the live final on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Her win came <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/dan-osborne-admits-smiling-hasnt-always-possible-amid-cheating-claims-jacqueline-jossa-heads-im-celebrity-finale-11412483/">amid allegations that her husband Dan Osborne had cheated on her</a> with fellow camp mate Myles Stephenson’s girlfriend Gabby Allen, claims Dan has denied.</p>
      <p>He also squashed rumours he had a three some with his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/celebrity-big-brother/">Celebrity Big Brother</a> co-stars Chloe Ayling and Natalie Nunn.</p>
      <p>The soap star is said to have been allowed to speak to her other half after Myles reportedly told her about the Gabby claims, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/26/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-threatens-quit-phone-call-dan-osborne-cheating-allegations-unaired-scenes-11218991/">threatened to quit the show altogether.</a></p>
      <p>But according to Andy, Jacqueline is in good spirits – but he did allude to some ‘tough times’ she had in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Good Morning Britain on Monday, he said: ‘She’s fine, we’ve just done some filming for the Coming Out show. She looks fine, she’s got a magnificent dress on and she’s still got her crown on. She had a tough time in there at times, she’s done really well.’</p>

      <p>The mum of two <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/im-celebrity-2019-winner-jacqueline-jossa-snubs-interviews-dan-osborne-drama-11414335/">cancelled all TV interviews on Monday</a> to take some time out of the limelight.</p>
      <p>Her fellow camp mate James Haskell previously revealed Jac had struggled on the first day of filming.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun: ‘She was crying within the first hour of the show. She said she’d been through a lot of hard stuff in life. I don’t know about it.</p>
      <p>‘She was saying she wanted to do something for herself. She wants to prove people wrong and make her daughters proud.’</p>
      <p>The actress herself suggested that she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/im-celeb-winner-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-tears-fears-seen-doormat-11413281/">wanted people to stop seeing her as a ‘doormat’.</a></p>
      <p>‘It’s easy to care so much about what other people think of you. It just doesn’t make sense. In here you have no choice, you have to be you,’ she told hosts Ant and Dec after leaving camp.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve always been known as Lauren from EastEnders, like a doormat or whatever you want to call it. I’ve proved myself. People now know me as Jacqueline. Sometimes I worry that I come across harsh.’</p>
