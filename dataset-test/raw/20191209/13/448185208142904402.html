      <p><b>Mumbai</b>: The Mumbai Football India is all set to host the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup next year and the preparations and build-up are in full swing. The Mumbai Football  Arena will play host to the U-17 Women’s Football Tournament 2019 — a first-of-its-kind international tournament for girls that will see India take on Sweden and Thailand, both powerhouses in the global women’s game.</p>
      <p>The tournament is organized under UEFA Assist in collaboration with AFC comes right after the recently-concluded Hero U-17 Women’s Championship that took place in Kalyani, which saw a total of 73 players divided into four teams playing against each other as the Alex Ambrose-coached Lionesses emerged victoriously.</p>
      <p>AIFF General Secretary Kushal Das spoke about the importance of competition as part of the build-up for next year’s World Cup, laying emphasis on the “quality of opposition” the Indian U-17 girls will face.</p>
      <p>“It is the first time an International tournament for girls in being hosted in India and I’m really looking forward to it. With the FIFA World Cup on the horizon, this will be a great opportunity for the Indian team to the likes of Sweden and Thailand. I wish the teams all the best for the competition,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I also need to thank AFC, UEFA, FSDL, Ministry for Sports and Youth Affairs, and Hero Motocorp for all their help and support,” he added.</p>
      <p>India U-17 World Cup Coach Thomas Dennerby felt the tournament will “benefit the team immensely”.</p>
      <p>“It is very important to play International Friendlies against strong opponents. It helps us to learn more about decision making in crunch situations, besides helping us to maintain the pace of the game,” he maintained. “The players and all the staff are very much looking forward to the tournament. It is an acid test which was very much needed.”</p>
      <p>Sweden ranks as one of the top nations in the world in women’s football, with their senior side finishing third in the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2019 in France — which was also the fourth time in eight editions that they finished in the top four of the global extravaganza.</p>
      <p>Thailand too is considered to be one of the top nations in Asia in women’s football, with them having secured consecutive qualifications for the last two FIFA Women’s World Cups along with a fourth-place finish at the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2018 in Jordan.</p>
      <p>The fixtures for the tournament are as follows:</p>
