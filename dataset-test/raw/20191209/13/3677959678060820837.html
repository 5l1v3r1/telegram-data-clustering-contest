      <p>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S11 flagship won't be for another couple of months. However, leaks keep painting a picture for all of us looking forward to the device and what it will have in store for users. The latest leak regarding the handset states that the Galaxy S11+ will be equipped with a whopping 108MP camera sensor for enhanced image quality. Let's dive in to see some more details on the Galaxy S11+ 108MP camera and what can we expect from the larger sensor.</p>
      <h3>Samsung Galaxy S11+ to Feature 108MP Camera Sensor to Offer Superior Image Quality</h3>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, the camera sensor is physically larger than the traditional smartphone cameras. Samsung will use a 1/1.3-inch 108MP sensor and in contrast, the Galaxy S10 boasts a 1/1.255-inch 12MP sensor. If the leak ever sees daylight, we can expect the primary sensor on the Galaxy S11+ to be substantially bigger, even bigger than what Huawei uses in its Mate 30 Pro.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Apart from this, the leak suggests that this is not an ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor, but a custom sensor for enhanced picture quality. Since it is a custom sensor, we can expect it to be more expensive compared to the 108MP sensor on Xiaomi smartphones which we have seen recently.</p>

      <p>One of the major aspects bolstering the superior image quality is the larger sensor. Conjoined with better image processing, low-light photography along with dynamic range could potentially receive a major boost since the sensor would be able to take in more light.

      <p>The 108MP primary camera on the Galaxy S11+ will be one of the five cameras which are rumored to be part of the mix. Other sensors include an ultra-wide-angle shooter, a ToF sensor and a 5X Telephoto sensor. There will be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for more details on Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S11+ camera and more.</p>
