      <h1>KSI is brutal as he delivers knock out blow to Tommy Fury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:50:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Higgins</a></address>
      <p>He recently said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/ksi-fighting-donald-trump-bizarre-boxing-photo-11232415/">he would like to fight Donald Trump</a> in the boxing ring.</p>
      <p>But KSI has snubbed a more er, realistic, challenger – boxer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tommy-fury/">Tommy Fury</a>.</p>
      <p>In a new interview the YouTube sensation, 26, has responded to 20-year old Tommy’s recent challenge<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ksi-triumphs-logan-paul-boxing-rematch-fierce-fight-11068044/"> following his intense win against</a> fellow YouTube personality, American Logan Paul, in LA last month.</p>
      <p>Having watched the fierce fight, Love Island contestant Tommy then <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/love-island-star-tommy-fury-20861236">threw his hat into the ring.</a></p>

      <p>‘You know, I’m a fighting man, I’m no amateur,’ he said. ‘We’re both from the influencer background, he’s from the YouTube side, I’m from the Love Island/reality TV side. Let’s get it on.’</p>
      <p>‘If he wants a real fight, he knows where I am,’ Tommy added.</p>
      <p>But KSI, who was the underdog in his fight with Logan, believes he’s now too good for Tommy.</p>
      <p>‘If I’m honest, not really,’ <a href="https://fault-magazine.com/2019/12/ksi-exclusive-fault-magazine-digital-cover-shoot-and-interview/">he told Fault magazine</a>. ‘He needs me more than I need him, like way more.’</p>

      <p>‘I’m on a completely different level to him. If he wants a fight he can fight one of my coaches, Viddal Riley, but he won’t though because Viddal would f**k him up,’ added KSI.</p>
      <p>He went on to add that he would rather fight ‘rappers’ and ‘other celebrities’ but declined to say which ones exactly.</p>

      <p>Last month he put his recent win down to beating fear: ‘KSI last time was scared, I was scared to fight, I was scared to touch him…this time I went in, I just kept going,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘They saw how much bigger [Logan] was, they saw his physique…I said “Screw that, I’m going to work my ass off.”‘</p>
      <p>KSI, whose real name is Olajide ‘JJ’ Olatunji, has beaten the odds after even <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/ksis-coach-jeff-mayweather-reveals-troubles-training-camp-says-not-real-fighter-11053035/">his trainer said he was ‘not a real fighter’.</a></p>
      <p>In the other camp, Tommy is yet to fight since finishing runner-up in the ITV show this summer with girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague.<a href="https://www.seetickets.com/event/championship-boxing-daniel-dubois-tommy-fury/queen-elizabeth-olympic-park/1398838"> He is scheduled to box on 21 December</a> but it is not yet known who his opponent will be.</p>
      <p>Tommy will soon hit screens <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/05/love-islands-tommy-fury-and-curtis-pritchard-swap-lives-in-new-tv-series-11272012/">in a new TV show where he will swap lives with fellow Love Islander Curtis Pritchard</a>.</p>
      <p>That sounds much more our cup of tea.</p>
