        <i>Benjamin Monk is accused of murder and Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith denies assault</i>
      </p>
      <p>A police officer accused of the murder of the former Aston Villa striker Dalian Atkinson will stand trial in September alongside a colleague who denies assaulting the ex-footballer.</p>
      <p>PC Benjamin Monk, 41, was not required to enter pleas to a count of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter during a pre-trial hearing at Birmingham crown court on Monday.</p>
      <p>His colleague PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, 29, entered a not guilty plea to a charge that she assaulted Atkinson occasioning actual bodily harm before his death on 15 August 2016.</p>
      <p>Both officers were charged last month after a three-year inquiry into the death of Atkinson, 48, who went into cardiac arrest in an ambulance on his way to hospital.</p>
      <p>Atkinson, who also played for Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday, died after police used a Taser during an incident near his fatherâ€™s house in the Trench area of Telford, Shropshire.</p>
      <p>The judge, Melbourne Inman QC, granted the officers unconditional bail until a further hearing in May, and fixed a trial date of 14 September at Birmingham crown court.</p>
