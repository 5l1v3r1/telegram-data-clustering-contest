      <h1>NHS promises from all major parties are 'not physically possible'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:02:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Drewett</a></address>
      <p>Leading health officials have said promises made by the major parties on the NHS are misleading or impossible.</p>
      <p>Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said politicians had ducked the big issues in regard to health and social care.</p>
      <p>While Royal College of Physicians president professor Andrew Goddard said manifesto promises on the NHS were not ‘physically possible’ because of a lack of people in training to fulfil them.</p>
      <p>They both said they have ‘grave concerns’ over how the major parties have campaigned on the NHS throughout the election campaign.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have promised above-inflation increases to spending on frontline care.</p>
      <p>Labour has pledged to boost nurse numbers by 24,000 while the Tories have promised 50,000 nurses, but this would include almost 20,000 who are current staff.</p>
      <p>But Mr Hopson said politicians on both sides had failed to offer ‘credible answers’ to the NHS’s toughest challenges and that the funding commitments they had made were disappointing.</p>

      <p>He wrote in The Times today: ‘In reality, they go no further than restoring NHS funding growth to what they’ve been in past.</p>
      <p>‘But it’s not just about money. Whilst we are pleased that parties are committing to increase staff numbers, it’s still not clear how that will actually happen.</p>
      <p>‘The offers from the main parties have varied in scope and ambition, but none has developed a compelling worked-through and credibly funded long-term solution.’</p>
      <p>He added there was a ‘worrying mismatch’ between what the major parties were promising and what their pledged funding would actually buy.</p>
      <p>Mr Hopson said: ‘Bandying about large-sounding increases, based on five-year aggregate numbers, and saying “all will be well” is raising unrealistic expectations that the NHS will inevitably disappoint.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Prof Goddard warned patients in hospital should get used to seeing their doctors less as the health service reached ‘crunch point’.</p>
      <p>He told The Independent he was frustrated ‘by the proposed policies and promises’ by Labour and the Tories and their ‘relationship to reality and what actually is deliverable’.</p>
      <p>The East Midlands gastroenterologist also said all three major parties had failed to address the looming workforce crisis among NHS doctors.</p>

      <p>Labour and the Tories had used the NHS as a ‘political football’ he said, adding: ‘It’s really hard. In my life I have voted for all three main political parties.</p>
      <p>‘I currently have internal conflicts on which way I will vote, there is no easy choice. None of the parties has thought about the long-term problems facing us.</p>
      <p>‘The promises that have been made in the manifestos are not physically possible because we don’t have enough people training to fulfil those promises.</p>
      <p>‘We need to think about where we want to be in 15 years’ time and plan for it now.’</p>
      <p>He argued that Labour’s proposals to train 5,000 more GPs would result in fewer doctors training in psychiatry or emergency medicine.</p>
      <p>The Tories’ plan to have 6,000 more GPs by 2024 was not feasible without ‘flooding’ the trainee system with overseas doctors, Prof Goddard said.</p>
      <p>Currently, the NHS pays around £1.5 billion to train around 7,250 doctors a year, but the professor said this needed to double to about 15,000 a year, at a cost in excess of £3 billion.</p>
