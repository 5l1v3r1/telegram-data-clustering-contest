      <h1>EU unveils €3bn research fund to develop batteries</h1>
      <h2>Seven member states to invest in the project which is set to run until 2031</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:18:47+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:18</time> by <a rel="author">Javier Espinoza, Guy Chazan</a></address>
      <p>The EU has approved a €3.2bn fund to promote the research and development of batteries as it targets strategic areas in which to help European companies develop new technology to keep up with global competition.</p>
      <p>Seven EU countries — Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden — will provide funding of up to €3.2bn for the project, set to be completed by 2031. The European Commission said it expected a further €5bn in private investment.</p>
      <p>Announcing the initiative on Monday, Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of promoting technology in Europe and the EU’s competition commissioner, said: “Battery production in Europe is of strategic interest for our economy and society because of its potential in terms of clean mobility and energy, job creation, sustainability and competitiveness.”</p>
      <p>She added: “The approved aid will ensure that this important project can go ahead without unduly distorting competition.”</p>
      <p>Maros Sefcovic, vice-president for interinstitutional relations and foresight, said: “Thanks to intensive efforts by seven member states, industry and the commission, Europe’s first major pan-European battery ecosystem is emerging, with lead projects in all segments of this strategic value chain.”</p>
      <p>The plan will involve 17 direct participants, mostly industrial actors, including small and medium-sized businesses, the commission said. Representatives from the member states will monitor the project.</p>
      <p>Peter Altmaier, Germany’s economic affairs minister, called it “a big success for Germany and Europe as a destination for investments in the auto industry”.</p>
      <p>He added: “We want to produce the most innovative and sustainable batteries in Germany and Europe and so secure added value and jobs in Europe. That is why we are pursuing a comprehensive approach with our concept, from material to production to recycling. Now it’s up to us to get concrete projects off the ground.”</p>

      <p>Mr Altmaier said German companies BASF, BMW, Opel, and Varta were involved in the initiative, which he called “the first success of an ambitious European industrial policy”.</p>
      <p>Chemicals group BASF will contribute battery materials. BMW will be involved in developing the chemical composition, cell mechanism, cell designs and the production process.</p>
      <p>Carmaker Opel will set up a joint venture with its French parent PSA and the French battery producer Saft to produce innovative battery cells in Kaiserslautern in south-west Germany.</p>
      <p>The plan is for Germany to produce battery cells on an industrial scale by the mid-2020s at the latest.</p>
      <p>Separately, Ms Vestager said EU regulators would review 20-year-old rules defining market power for companies to take into account advances in technology and a more globalised economy.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Chillin Competition Conference in Brussels, she said: “Changes like globalisation and digitisation mean that many markets work rather differently from the way they did 22 years ago.</p>
      <p>“So the time has come to review the market definition notice. We want to be sure that the guidance it gives is accurate and up to date, and sets out a clear and consistent approach to both antitrust and merger cases across different industries, in a way that’s easily accessible,” she said.</p>
