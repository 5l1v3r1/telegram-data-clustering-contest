      <p>That's right, we Malaysians were the <b>first in the world</b> to get a glimpse of the HUAWEI Nova 5T ahead of it's global launch. Positioned as a lifestyle smartphone, the HUAWEI Nova 5T is for those who value top-notch performance, insane camera features, and aesthetically-pleasing design.</p>
      <h4>Not convinced yet? Here are 4 reasons you might like the HUAWEI Nova 5T:</h4>
      <h4>1. The HUAWEI Nova 5T has a five camera setup that will please every angle</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Coming with five different cameras - four on the rear and one on the front, the HUAWEI Nova 5T aims to capture that picture-perfect moment every single time. The rear Quad-AI camera setup consists of a 48MP main camera, a 16MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth-sensing camera. The depth-sensing lens helps with that buttery-smooth bokeh for portrait modes, which is always a plus!<br/><br/>The 32MP front selfie camera is actually hidden under the 6.26-inch 'All-View Display'. This provides a flawless, unobtrusive content viewing experience, without any unnecessary distractions. </p>

      <p>Another neat feature of the Quad-AI camera setup is the ability to shoot stunning lowlight photography via the AIS Super Night Mode, which drastically reduces noise while still retaining as much light as possible. This is an especially useful feature for those who love the contrast of brightly-lit subjects in darker settings.<br/><br/>Say goodbye to grainy night-time shots! ﻿</p>
      <h4>2. The Kirin 980 chipset packs a real punch in terms of performance</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/745737/d1f7.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>At the heart of the Nova 5T is the world's first 7nm mobile AI chipset, which lets you enjoy a super fluid, super smooth user experience, without any nasty lag. The dual-NPU setup enables the Nova 5T to take on even the most demanding tasks, like hardcore gaming and even a long day of multi-tasking! <br/><br/>The power of the Kirin 980 chipset is also complemented by 8GB RAM and 128GB ROM, featuring ultra-fast storage (UFS) technology.<br/><br/>Optimum performance at an efficient level of power consumption. What more could you ask for? :D</p>

      <h4>3. The 3,750 mAh battery provides all-day usability and quick-charging capabilities thanks to its 22.5W SuperCharge technology</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/745882/1caa.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It's tiring when you have to wait for your phone to charge up before you can finally use it for your daily content viewing pleasure. The HUAWEI Nova 5T gets rid of that burden by packing a fairly decent 3,750 mAh battery, coupled with 22.5W SuperCharge technology. Just how fast is this charging technology exactly?<br/><br/>It's pretty zippy. It takes just 30 minutes to get from a dead battery to 50%. That means you get to spend less time waiting for your phone to charge, and more time actually using it to its full potential!</p>

      <h4>4. The design of the HUAWEI Nova 5T is aimed at trendsetters, and rightly so</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>The HUAWEI Nova 5T comes in three different colours - Black, Blue Crush, and Midsummer Purple. The exclusive Midsummer Purple variant also gets a special Nova monogram on the back, just to add to the stylish look of the device. <br/><br/>The 6.26-inch 'All-View Display' provides a 91.7% screen-to-body ration, which means you'll really be able to see ALL of your content in such a pleasing screen size. The front-facing camera itself is placed on the top-left corner of the screen, hidden from direct line of sight. That means you're able to focus on your content, and just your content alone!<br/><br/>The phone also uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, making it super ergonomic for daily use, since our natural grip usually rests our thumb (for right handers) and index finger (for lefties) where the sensor is positioned. No fumbling about here. :)</p>
