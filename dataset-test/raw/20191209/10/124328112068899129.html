      <p>A woman who was drugged and sexually assaulted by her flatmate was called a s**t in court by her attacker's girlfriend on Monday. </p>
      <p>The woman's flatmate had put the drug GHB, known as fantasy, in her drink when they had shared a bottle of wine and some vodka in August 2016. </p>
      <p>The woman became unconscious and woke up to the 34-year-old flatmate kissing her and her pants had been removed, the court heard according to <a href="https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/crime-court/woman-threatened-in-court-by-partner-of-man-who-drugged-and-sexually-assaulted-her/news-story/3c5c61238b07b70cadbe0286b91b9228"><b>The Gold Coast Bulletin</b></a>. </p>

      <p>Toxicology tests showed there was GHB in her urine but she had never knowingly taken the drug. </p>
      <p>The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, had moved into the unit just two weeks before the incident. </p>
      <p>The now 37-year-old appeared in Southport District Court on Monday and plead guilty to one count of administering a drug for the purpose of sexual assault and sexual assault. </p>
      <p>He was sentenced to two years prison, suspended after six months. </p>
      <p>At the conclusion of proceedings the man's girlfriend walked passed the victim, who had been crying, and reportedly said s**t. </p>
      <p>She then followed that up by telling the woman: 'I am going to get you, you dog'. </p>
      <p>The defence barrister for the man said he was fully clothed during the assault and had undergone counselling since the incident. </p>
      <p>He also said the man's motivation was to make the woman more easily persuaded rather than to render her unconscious. </p>
      <p>When delivering the sentence, Judge Catherine Muir, however, said the attack was a serious breach of trust by the man who the woman had allowed to live in her unit. </p>
