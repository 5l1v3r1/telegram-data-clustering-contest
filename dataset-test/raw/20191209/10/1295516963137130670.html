      <p>Following the release of Todd Phillips' <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker-film/">Joker</a>, the internet had some fun with the iconic scene in which Joaquin Phoenix's Clown Prince of Crime dances down a flight of stairs to "Rock and Roll Part 2" towards the end of the film -- recutting it with various different songs.</p>
      <p>A recent instance of this meme saw Phoenix's Joker dancing to "Sexy Boy," the theme song used by <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> legend Shawn Michaels. After being posted online, this particular clip caught the eye of none other than Michaels himself, with WWE's first Grand Slam Champion giving it his seal of approval.</p>

      <p>The video was shared to Twitter by WWE/NXT superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/RealKeithLee/status/1203031797304582154?s=20">Keith Lee</a>. "The internet deserves this," Lee wrote. "This was shown to me by one of my favorite people. To whoever created this masterpiece... thank you. To the interwebs... you're welcome."</p>
      <p>Before too long, the clip found its way to the Heartbreak Kid, who <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnMichaels/status/1203158672706289664?s=20">quote-tweeted</a> Lee's post. "I give it 9 out of 10 on the HBK rating scale," Michaels wrote.</p>
