      <p>A snake on the outfield delayed the start of a cricket match in India.</p>
      <p>The new season of the Ranji Trophy, a domestic first-class competition, was getting under way around the country on Monday but the match between Andhra and Vidarbha in Vijayawada was held up for an unusual reason.</p>

      <p>Footage posted on Twitter by the BCCI showed the players waiting around as a snake slithered through the outfield before play had got under way.</p>
      <p>Vidarbha, who won the toss, were in the field and their players could be seen attempting to shoo the intruder off the surface.</p>

      <p>The snake was not the first unwanted intruder to hold up a cricket match this year â€“ in June a World Cup match between Sri Lanka and South Africa in Durham was halted because of a swarm of bees.</p>
