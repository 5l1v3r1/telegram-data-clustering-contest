      <p>Saif Ali Khan is one of the most genuine and classy actors we have in Bollywood. His character as Sartaj Singh in <i>Sacred Games</i> wasn’t just applauded by his fans, but critics as well. His last film, <i>Laal Kaptaan,</i> didn’t work great at the box office but his performance won the hearts of audience.</p>
      <p>Talking about the hardships in Bollywood, Saif told Pinkvilla that he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do after school. He just didn’t want to do a 9-5 job and hence thought, films are better than that. “I was clueless after school and I didn’t know what to do when I joined films. I just knew I didn’t want to do a desk job. I thought I’ll die if I have to do a 9-5 thing. The idea of films was very different because of the variety of the job,” Saif said.</p>

      <p>He further added, “Cricket was in my blood, it’s treated like religion. Not just my dad, my grandad also captained India and played against Don Bradman. I played good cricket and I never played in school or college. What let me down is that cricket is a very mental game, it’s about patience and timing. That I was strongly lacking in and that’s why my cricket career was doomed.”</p>
      <p>During the initial days in the industry, Saif revealed how people would tell her that he looked and sounded like a girl in auditions. “People have been nasty. They have been mean. People talk about your looks. I guess I didn’t look like a hero. Akshay Kumar did. They felt I looked like a girl. I certainly had a bad voice which I hadn’t worked on. So sometimes, I was squeaking away in an English accent,” Saif added.</p>
      <p>Well, all’s well that ends well. Isn’t it?</p>
      <p>On the work front, he will be next seen in <i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i> opposite Ajay Devgn and the trailer has already garnered him praises from all around.</p>
