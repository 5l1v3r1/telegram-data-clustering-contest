      <p>I'm A Celebrity 2019 winner Jacqueline Jossa had it in the bag from day five, according to her campmate Roman Kemp.</p>
      <p>Roman finished in third place on the series on Sunday, with Jacqueline being crowned Queen of the Jungle.</p>
      <p>But it was no surprise to Roman that the EastEnders star went all the way to victory.</p>
      <p>In fact, he predicted it on day five and secretly told Jacqueline she could win it after she considered quitting the show.</p>
      <p>After a "wobble" in camp, with the first few days being extremely tough, Roman urged her to stay in the jungle.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Lorraine on Monday morning, Roman confessed: "I said to her from day five!</p>
      <p>"She had a bit of a wobble and was missing home. She'd come back from Snake Rock and had been sleeping on the floor.</p>
      <p>"I gave her a hug and pulled her aside, cos I didn't want the others to hear, and I whispered in her ear, 'If you can stay youâ€™ll win it, you will'."</p>

      <p>Roman then confessed that when the winner was announced, the pair looked at each other with him telling her "I told you".</p>
      <p>It comes after the news that Jacqueline has skipped all live TV interviews in the wake of her win.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline has chosen to spend time with her family, amid filming with ITV for the Coming Out show this week.</p>

      <p>A source close to Jacqueline told Mirror Online: "She has to film for the 'coming out' show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family.</p>
      <p>"Jacqueline and Dan spent time together in the hotel and probably had a lot to talk about."</p>
      <p>Runner-up Andy Whyment also discussed Jacqueline's win on the show, sharing she had a "tough time" in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Andy commented that she was doing "fine" since arriving back at the hotel, pleased for her taking the crown.</p>
