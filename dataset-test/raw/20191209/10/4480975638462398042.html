      <h1>Gold clings to modest gains above $1460 level, lacks follow-through</h1>

          <b>Gold gains some traction amid persistent US-China trade uncertainty.</b>

          <b>Sliding US bond yields undermined the USD and remained supportive.</b>
        </li>

          <b>The uptick is likely to remain capped ahead of the FOMC policy update.</b>

      </ul>
      <p>Gold edged higher on the first day of a new trading week and recovered a part of Friday's post-NFP slide to multi-day lows.</p>
      <p>The latest US monthly jobs report surpassed most optimistic estimates, which provided a goodish intraday lift to the US dollar and eventually prompted some aggressive selling around the dollar-denominated commodity.</p>
      <h3>Focus on trade, FOMC</h3>
      <p>However, persistent uncertainty over a potential phase one trade deal between the world's two largest economies extended some support to the precious metal's perceived safe-haven status and helped gain some traction on Monday.</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning that top White House Economic Adviser, Larry Kudlow confirmed on Friday that the December 15 deadline to impose new tariffs on around $156 billion worth Chinese products remains in place.</p>
      <p>Kudlow also said that the US President Donald Trump is pleased with the progress in trade negotiations, which added to a flurry of recent conflicting trade signals and kept a lid on the optimism and weighed on investors' <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a>.</p>
      <p>Adding to this, a pullback in the US Treasury bond yields, which kept the USD bulls on the defensive, further provided an additional boost to the non-yielding yellow metal, albeit the uptick seemed to lack any bullish conviction.</p>
      <p>Moreover, investors might also be reluctant to place any aggressive bets ahead of the upcoming event risk, the latest FOMC <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> update, which might further contribute towards capping any runaway rally.</p>
      <p>Hence, it will be prudent to wait for some strong follow-through buying before positioning for any further intraday appreciating move amid absent relevant market moving economic releases from the US.</p>
