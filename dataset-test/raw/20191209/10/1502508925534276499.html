      <p>Senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/siddaramaiah">Siddaramaiah </a>on Monday resigned as the Congress Legislature Party leader, taking moral responsibility for the party's poor show in the assembly bypolls.</p>
      <p>The Congress, which held 12 of the 15 seats where byelections were held on December five, won only two, in a huge set-back to the opposition party.</p>
      <p>In a letter to Interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/siddaramaiah">Siddaramaiah </a>expressed his sincere regrets for not being able to give "satisfactory results" in the byelections.</p>
      <p>"I deem it necessary to step down as Leader of the CLP by taking moral responsibility", he wrote.</p>
      <p>"As a CLP leader, there is a need to uphold the democratic principles. In the interest of the party, I have tendered my resignation as the CLP leader", <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/siddaramaiah">Siddaramaiah </a>told reporters.</p>
      <p>The byelection was seen as much a litmus test for Siddaramaiah as it was for Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa.</p>
