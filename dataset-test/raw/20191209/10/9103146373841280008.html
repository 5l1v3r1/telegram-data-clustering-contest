        <b>Celebrity power on Friday swept judicial officers and support staff off their feet. This was when seven-year-old Patrick Senyonjo aka fresh kid performed at the judiciary end of year party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When the master of ceremony mentioned the name fresh kid, most of the judicial officers and their support staff who had gathered at the high court gardens in Kampala for their end of year party stood up.</p>
      <p>Some of them pulled out their smartphones and started filming as Fresh Kid advanced to the stage.</p>
      <p>The young celebrity started singing as the judicial officers enjoyed his thrilling music despite being composed in Luganda.</p>
      <p>Chief Justice Bart Katureebe, Deputy Chief Justice Alfonse Owiny-Dollo, retiring Principal Judge Dr Yorokamu Bamwiine, Justice and Constitutional minister Maj Gen. (rtd) Kahinda Otafiire, Secretary to judiciary Pius Bigirimana and Out-going Chief Registrar Esta Nambayo were visibly amused with Fresh Kid’s music.</p>
      <p> Bamwine was also seen dancing as the young star entertained the judicial officers.</p>
      <p>They gave him thunderous claps and later took turns to shake his hand.</p>
      <p>A number of judicial officers were seen taking selfies with the young teenager.</p>
      <p>Katureebe lauded Fresh Kid and implored him to balance talent with education in order to be successful.</p>

      <p>Bigirimana revealed that he got to know Fresh kid last year when he was a permanent secretary in the ministry of gender and vowed to help him realise the dream of becoming a permanent secretary.</p>
      <p>“When I met him at the Ministry of Gender, I found that he was being cheated by his manager. I decided to divide the proceeds from his shows. I ordered that three accounts be opened for his personal saving, mother and father. I told his parents that his money should be kept on his account until he reaches maturity age and put it into proper use,” Bigirimana said.</p>
