      <p><b>Share Market News Today | Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices LIVE:</b> The headline indices Sensex and Nifty ended marginally higher on Monday afternoon, amid volatility. The Sensex closed about 43 points higher to 40,487.43, while the Nifty  closed near the 11,950-mark. <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/tata-consultancy-services-ltd-stock-price/">TCS</a>, <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/hcl-technologies-ltd-stock-price/">HCL Tech</a>, L&amp;T were among the biggest losers, shedding up to 3%. Asian stocks edged up on Monday, catching some of Wall Street’s momentum after surprisingly strong US jobs data although regional gains were capped by concerns about China’s economy due to the prolonged Sino-US trade war. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei advanced 0.3% while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3%, with Australian stocks and South Korea’s Kospi up 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The dollar held firm on Monday after data showed surprise strength in the US jobs market, but the currency was restrained from moving higher by worries about an escalation in the US-China trade war. The dollar index stood almost flat at 97.704 in early Asian trade on Monday, after rising 0.3% on Friday, Reuters reported.
