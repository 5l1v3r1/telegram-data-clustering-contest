      <h1>Meet The McLaren 620R: The Most Powerful Sports Series Yet</h1>
      <h2>The new McLaren 620R is a GT4 race car for the road.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:15:32+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>If you thought the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mclaren/600lt">McLaren 600LT</a> was the most hardcore Sports Series model, wait until you see the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mclaren/620r">McLaren 620R</a>. Based on the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mclaren-is-rolling-out-two-track-only-570s-supercars-here-s-the-first-one">track-only 570S GT4</a>, the McLaren 620R is essentially a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/leaked-mclaren-620r-is-a-race-car-for-the-road">GT4 race car for the road</a>, offering motorsport credentials in a road-legal package. McLaren describes the 620R as the "most track-focused, track-ready but roadgoing McLaren Sports Series model." It was built to celebrate the success of the 570S GT4 customer race car, which is the most successful GT car built by McLaren with more race wins and podiums than any other to date since debuting in 2017.</p>
      <p>The McLaren 620R looks like a race car, handles like a race car, performs like a race car and feels like a race car, resulting in a seamless transition from race to road and vice versa. It shares the same lightweight single-piece carbon fiber Monocell II chassis as the 570S GT4, with a targeted dry weight of 2,826 pounds. Adjustable aerodynamic elements, race-derived suspension components, and powertrain recalibration to increase power and performance further enhance the 620R's dynamics.</p>

      <p>Powering the 620R is the same 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the GT4 car, but with significantly more power. Since the car isn't restricted by racing regulations, the engine ECU and turbocharger management have been reconfigured to produce 610 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque, making the 620R the most powerful Sports Series car yet. This enables the 620R to hit 0-62 mph in 2.9 seconds and 0-124 mph in 8.1 seconds before maxing out at 200 mph.</p>
      <p>Power is sent through a seven-speed Seamless Shift Gearbox with super-fast shift times ideal for setting blistering lap times. For added drama on the road, selecting Sport mode allows the driver to hear the upshift 'crack' created by a split-second cut of the ignition spark during a gearshift.</p>

      <p>Other motorsport components derived from the 570S GT4 include two-way manually adjustable coilover dampers, which feature 32 clicks of adjustment per corner to allow a driver to tailor compression and rebound rates to suit their driving style and track conditions and is 13.2 pounds lighter than the regular Sports Series units. The suspension also features lightweight aluminum wishbones and uprights and stiffer anti-roll bars and springs than those fitted on a regular Sports Series model.</p>
      <p>The rubber top mounts have been replaced with solid stainless-steel alternatives resulting in "noticeable improvements" in steering control and feedback. An adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing raised 12.5 inches into the cleaner airflow above the vehicle increases downforce while minimizing drag, which is now road legal thanks to an incorporated third brake light.</p>

      <p>The front bumper, splitter, and hood have been redesigned, with the splitter retaining the 570S GT4's aero blades and cut-outs, while the carbon fiber hood has twin nostrils to aid downforce and clean up the airflow over the top of the car. Front dive planes contribute up to 66 pounds of downforce as part of the 143 pounds delivered by the full-frontal aero package.</p>
      <p>Stopping power is provided by a lightweight braking system with carbon-ceramic discs (15.3-inch front and 14.9-inch rear) and forged aluminum brake calipers. As standard, the 620R rides on Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R semi-slick tires, but these can be swapped with optional, full-slick motorsport tires for track driving.</p>
      <p>Specially developed for McLaren by Pirelli's Motorsport team, the slick tires are optimized to complement the motorsport brakes and race-derived suspension of the 620R. They unlock a contact patch eight percent larger than the road tire, increasing lateral G-forces and enabling quicker lap times. This is the first time that a road-legal car with 19-inch front wheels and 20-inch rear wheels has been engineered to be able to run on slick tires without the need for additional mechanical adjustment.</p>

      <p>Being based on a GT4 race car, the interior has been stripped out and lacks luxuries such as a floor carpet and glovebox. Air-conditioning, IRIS Navigation, and an audio system are not included as standard but can be added at no extra cost. An upgraded Bowers &amp; Wilkins upgraded audio system is available as an optional extra. The driver and passenger sit in lightweight carbon fiber racing seats with six-point racing harnesses, fitted as standard. A McLaren Track Telemetry system comes as standard and is displayed on a center-mounted seven-inch touchscreen.</p>
      <p>Three colors are available inspired by the 570S: McLaren Orange (with white racing stripes), Silica White (orange stripes) and Onyx Black (orange stripes). Each can be optioned with race number decals and/or partner decals. Additional body colors are available from MSO.</p>
      <p>The McLaren 620R will be limited to just 350 units. Production will begin in January, with each car starting at $328,951 including taxes.</p>
