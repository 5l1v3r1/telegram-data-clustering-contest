      <h1>False fire cladding claims caught out by regulator's new teeth</h1>

      <p>Queensland suppliers of timber cladding and aluminium insulation who made false claims about their fire safety have been caught out by the state’s building regulator since it was granted stronger investigative powers.</p>
      <p>The supplier of the imported European timber cladding product had claimed it was non-combustible and passed appropriate testing.</p>

      <p>However, independent testing carried out by the Queensland Building and Construction Commission’s non-conforming building product unit found the cladding failed the required fire spread test.</p>
      <p>The supplier has since withdrawn its fire safety claims, with the QBCC investigating further potential offences.</p>
      <p>The details are among a number released by the QBCC three years after new laws - under which the specialist unit was established - were enacted to extend responsibility for building products further along the supply chain.</p>
      <p>The regulator has fielded almost two complaints each week since the investigative unit was established in November 2017 - more than 300 in total.</p>
      <p>"Before the laws were introduced the lion’s share of the blame lay at the end of the supply chain, with sub-contractors and installers carrying the burden of detecting dodgy products," QBCC commissioner Brett Bassett said in a statement Monday.</p>
      <p>"Now, everyone in the supply chain including manufacturers, suppliers, installers and importers are responsible for ensuring building products are safe and fit for their intended purpose."</p>
      <p>Another investigation into an aluminium wall and ceiling insulation product found it achieved a much lower fire classification than claimed. That company has since ceased supplying the product.</p>
      <p>A garden shed sold to customers in far north Queensland that was promised could withstand winds of up to 147km/h was found to require a separate kit to make it cyclone-resistant - a detail left off the packaging.</p>
      <p>Last year, a portable pool fence was recalled nationwide after a QBCC investigation that extended to Victoria.</p>
      <p>Mr Bassett said subcontractors installing those products had been misled by the false claims, leading to potentially serious safety risks.</p>
      <p>"Penalties for defective or negligent work can range from fines of thousands of dollars to a three-year ban for a first offence," he said.</p>
      <p>Anyone with concerns about potentially non-conforming building products can lodge a complaint on <a href="https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/">the QBCC website</a>.</p>
