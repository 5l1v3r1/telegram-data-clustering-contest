      <h1>People share stressful Christmas stories to combat pressure to be perfect</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:16:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:16</time> by <a rel="author">Natalie Morris</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is meant to be the most wonderful time of the year – but for many people, that just isn’t the case.</p>
      <p>And the pressure to have a ‘perfect’ Christmas is causing unnecessary stress, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anxiety/">anxiety</a> and isolation for many people.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mental-health/">Mental health</a> charity <a href="https://www.thecalmzone.net/">CALM</a> (Campaign Against Living Miserably) has partnered with Twitter and a host of celebrities to launch #YuleSlog – a campaign that lifts the lid on the reality of Christmas, encouraging conversation around the nuanced pressures of Christmas time.</p>
      <p>For those who find themselves alone at Christmas, the pressure to be happy can accentuate feelings of isolation.</p>
      <p>In an online poll, CALM found that 41% experience feelings of loneliness around Christmas, with 46% say they feel left out of bigger social events.</p>
      <p>To help combat, and encourage conversation around this issue, CALM is asking people to join them in Tweeting #YuleSlog and shine a light on their festive reality – whether that’s too many social events, financial pressures, or feeling lonely.</p>

      <p>The data has found that the main reasons people feel misunderstood and alone at Christmas are the pressure to have a ‘perfect’ holiday, family struggles and nostalgia for past Christmases.</p>
      <p>Nearly 49% of Twitter users said they felt pressured to have fun during the festive period, leading to enhanced feelings of loneliness and anxiousness.</p>
      <p>As part of this, CALM has created <b>NOEL</b>, a character whose tips help people cope over Christmas and help any friends who are struggling.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saying <b>N</b>o if you need to. Whether it is buying gifts you can’t afford or going on a night out you don’t feel like.</li>
        <li><b>O</b>pen up, either about your feelings or try some new things this Christmas. Make this one your Christmas.</li>
        <li><b>E</b>njoy what you can. Take pleasure in the small things, whether it’s your dad’s awful jokes or your mate’s horrific christmas jumper.</li>
        <li><b>L</b>ook Forward. Christmas is only a day. Plan activities and stuff you like to do for January and beyond like a gig, holiday, a meet-up with a mate, or a <a href="https://www.thecalmzone.net/events/">marathon</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>‘The festive period can be a difficult time for lots of people,’ explains CALM CEO Simon Gunning.</p>
      <p>‘Spreading a message of reality and positivity can be empowering for those struggling through this period.</p>
      <p>‘With this partnership, we aim to celebrate the power of connection and communication, something we see through our free and anonymous helpline and webchat, which are open from 5pm-midnight every day across Christmas.’</p>
      <p>‘Just because other people might be saying they are having the perfect Christmas, it doesn’t mean you need to feel the pressure to do so yourself,’ adds Montana Brown.</p>
      <p>‘If you know someone who might be feeling lonely, anxious or overwhelmed by the Christmas period, then speak to them or ask how they are doing – as it could make all the difference.’</p>
      <p>Responding to the conversation online, lots of people are now sharing their less-than-idyllic realities of the festive period.</p>
      <p>‘I love Christmas and I get into the Christmas spirit from November,’ wrote one woman.</p>
      <p>‘But my dad passed away in December, two years ago on the 13th and I feel bad for getting into the Christmas spirit, but I actually think its helping me deal with it better being able to get into the Christmas mood.’</p>
      <p>‘My <s>#</s>yuleslog is trying to please everyone at Christmas,’ added another. ‘Yes it is the season to be jolly, but very hard when you feel you’re always going to let someone down because you can’t do everything for everyone <s>#</s>christmasmiracle needed sometimes.’</p>
