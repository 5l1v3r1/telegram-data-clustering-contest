      <p>It’s all in front of us to see how caring and loving <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/venkatesh-doesnt-mind-people-doubting-him/">Venkatesh</a> has been towards his nephew Naga Chaitanya and how he wants this movie to be a special one for not only him but give Chay the scope to be a better actor.</p>
      <p>In an interview, Bobby revealed how Venkatesh was fully concerned when he heard the narration of the story for the first time. “Why did you tell less about Chaitanya?” he asked Bobby. The script was still in the development stage, then.</p>
      <p>The senior star wanted more for his nephew and asked the same, to give something that gives memorable moments for Chaitanya and the audiences. According to Bobby, there were scenes where Chay has to perform while seniors like Venkatesh and Prakash Raj have to lie low.</p>
      <p>Venkatesh was very supportive when such scenes were shot, and he was constantly discussing with Chay and encouraging his nephew.</p>
      <p>Recently, Chay watched the full movie and was so impressed with it that he hugged his director and thanked him for making such a good film. Well, audiences are also awaiting to see the real-life uncle-nephew combo to create magic on the screen.</p>
