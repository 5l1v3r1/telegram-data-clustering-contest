      <p>Everton are investigating reports of homophobic chanting <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/12/07/everton-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest-goal-updates/">during Saturday's Premier League game against Chelsea.</a></p>
      <p>The abuse is alleged to have been directed at Chelsea fans during Everton's 3-1 win at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/12/08/duncan-ferguson-rolls-back-years-everton-inspired-memory-howard/">Everton </a>is working in conjunction with Kick It Out and has commenced an investigation into homophobic chanting reported during Saturday's Premier League game against Chelsea," a club statement said.</p>
      <p>"Both the club and Kick It Out have received reports of a homophobic chant being aimed at Chelsea's fans by a small section of the home crowd.</p>
      <p>"Homophobia has no place within our stadium, our club, our community or our game. The club strongly condemns such behaviour and is carrying out a thorough investigation which will include liaison with Merseyside Police.</p>
      <p>"Matchgoers who have information relating to any form of discrimination should email reportit@evertonfc.com."</p>
      <p>The alleged abuse came during a week in which the Premier League has backed Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport.</p>

      <p>Earlier on Sunday, a 41-year-old man was arrested in connection with allegations of racist abuse during Saturday's Manchester derby.</p>
      <p>A video circulated on social media appeared to show a Manchester City supporter aiming monkey chants towards Manchester United players during the Red Devils' 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>City swiftly issued a statement after the match saying the club was working with Greater Manchester Police, who announced on Sunday morning that the man had been arrested on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence.</p>
