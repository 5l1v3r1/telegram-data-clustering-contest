      <h1>Tories hold 10-point lead over Labour three days before election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:50:38+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:50</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Drewett</a></address>
      <p>The Conservatives have held onto their significant 10-point lead over Labour with just three days to go until Britain heads to the polls.</p>
      <p>As the campaign enters its final few days <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/boris-fishy-start-last-days-campaigning-labour-heartland-11414020/"> is attempting to sway voters in Labour strongholds</a> while Jeremy Corbyn targets swing seats he hopes to take from the Tories.</p>
      <p>But while they continue to battle it out around the country, the latest poll tracker shows Labour have tightened the gap – but suggest they won’t have done enough to deny Mr Johnson the majority he wants.</p>
      <p>According to PA’s poll of polls, the Conservatives enter the final week of campaigning up at 43%, with Labour 10 points behind at 33%.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats are down again on 12% with leader Jo Swinson admitting it ‘doesn’t look likely’ her party will win a majority.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s only in the circumstances of a Liberal Democrat majority government which of course in itself would be democratic.</p>
      <p>‘But where we are right now that obviously doesn’t look likely.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘The most likely way we can stop Brexit is through a people’s vote and the Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote for three-and-a-half years.’</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party remain on 4% after a bruising week for Nigel Farage, whose own MEPs quit to pledge allegiance to the Tories.</p>
      <p>And the Green Party is polling at 3% after encouraging tactical voting by teaming up with the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>The poll is based on an average of polling over the last week.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson has said in an open letter today that Thursday’s vote is ‘historic’ and a choice to ‘move forwards’ after Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said it was a ‘chance to vote for hope’ and he had ‘the most ambitious plan to transform our country in decades’.</p>
      <p>Later today, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will announce the Labour Party’s plan for its first 100 days should it win the general election – vowing to end austerity for good.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is warning that ‘the very future of Scotland’ is at stake in the election.</p>
      <p>She is appealing to voters to back her party ‘to escape Brexit, protect the NHS, and to put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands’.</p>
