      <p>Cape Town - <b>Liverpool </b>manager <b>Jurgen Klopp</b> has made it clear that he never doubted the talent of industrious midfielder <b>Naby Keita</b>.</p>
      <p>Keita, who arrived at Anfield to much fanfare in the summer of 2018, has been reduced to a peripheral figure and played a limited role in last season's Champions League success and the club's current 33-game Premier League unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>The Guinea international gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday's 3-0 win at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Reds boss Klopp, who has reassured the 24-year-old about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.</p>
      <p>"Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?" said Klopp.</p>
      <p>"We are not flying, it's not like we won all of the games 4-0, or 5-0, so we had to bring on a player who helps us with defending set-pieces.</p>
      <p>"Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, 'why don't I play?' I get all that.</p>
      <p>"So, we stayed in contact, we talked, and we spoke a lot about it.</p>
      <p>"But in the end, of course, a player needs to have this evidence that the manager still believes in you. I was never in doubt about that.</p>
      <p>"It was just unlucky and in life, you need luck always. He started (his Liverpool career) really well - everybody forgot that - then got injured. And again, we had two really good seasons.</p>
      <p>"(I was) never in doubt about his quality."</p>
