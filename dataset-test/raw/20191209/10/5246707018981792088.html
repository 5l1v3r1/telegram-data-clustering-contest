      <p>One of the highlights of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/watch_the_game_awards_2018_-_live">last year's Game Awards</a> was right at the very beginning of the show, as Nintendo of America's president at the time, Reggie Fils-Aimé, shared the stage with Xbox’s Phil Spencer, and ex-PlayStation boss Shawn Layden. It was a humbling display of solidarity between gaming's major rivals, something which has made its way into games themselves in the form of a rise in cross-platform play.</p>
      <p>As it happens, though, the special moment wasn't a particularly easy one to create. The show's host and creator Geoff Keighley recently spoke with fans on Reddit, answering their questions on this year's upcoming event. He <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/reggie-appearing-on-stage-with-playstation-and-xbox-execs-at-the-game-awards-2018-almost-didnt-happen/">revealed</a> that it took "months of negotiations", and that just days before the show he thought it wasn't going to happen at all.</p>
      <blockquote>"It was a dream of mine for a long time -- since the first show. I asked all three of the guys personally and they agreed to do it, but it did take months of negotiations to make it happen. A few days before the show I thought it had fallen apart and I was really sad. But then magically it came back together. Producing these shows is always an emotional rollercoaster, but I'm really proud of that moment, and glad I was able to help make it happen."</blockquote>
      <p>Here's the moment in question if you need a reminder:</p>

      <p>In the very same Reddit session, Keighley also announced that this year's show - taking place later this week - will reveal <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/12/around_10_new_games_will_be_revealed_at_the_game_awards_2019">"around 10 new games"</a>. It might be worth a watch.</p>
