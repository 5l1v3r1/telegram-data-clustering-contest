      <h1>Some online speculation about Trevor Deely's disappearance is "outrageous", sister says</h1>

        <b>The sister of Trevor Deely has said some of the online speculation about her brother's disappearance is "outrageous" and needs to be toned down "several notches".</b>
      </p>
      <p>22-year-old Trevor went missing from Dublin city centre on December 7th 2000.</p>
      <p>He was last seen on CCTV in the early hours of the morning after attending a work Christmas party.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, gardaí <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/renewed-appeal-19th-anniversary-trevor-deelys-disappearance-935035">issued a fresh appeal</a></b> for information on the 19th anniversary of Trevor's disappearance - saying that even the smallest piece of information may assist the investigation.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the <i>Pat Kenny Show</i> today, Trevor's sister Michele says the family has kept trying different ways to find Trevor but they keep 'coming up blank'.</p>
      <p>She observed: "We've done a huge amount of work... but all that work, in a way, is coming to haunt us - it's really becoming a very difficult item for the family when we think about speculation."</p>
      <p>Michele said speculation does happen in the media, but it's "rare" - suggesting that it's the online speculation that needs to "come down several notches".</p>
      <p>She observed: "You'd want to read what people write online - it is outrageous.</p>
      <p>"At some stage I do think there has [...] something - I don't if it's a ruling or something [like that] - that doesn't allow that occur.</p>
      <blockquote>"There's a lot of speculation around Trevor going to Alaska - that was the trip of a lifetime for him... He came home a couple of weeks prior to him going missing - it has nothing to do with anything."</blockquote>
      <p>She added: "There's lots of theories - [like] Trevor went to Alaska, got caught up in something and somebody followed him back and did something to him.</p>
      <p>"He was a simple guy... he was an entry level IT worker. And [yet] people have him caught up in this banking scam... [or] that he was involved in some crazy scheme, and that's why he was taken. It's crazy."</p>
      <p>Michele added that she's been rejected by multiple social media companies when she's brought the concerns to them.</p>
      <p>She told Pat: "I battle a lot to get the right facts out there, but it's actually really difficult."</p>
      <p>Michele said there have been 'hundreds, if not thousands' of potential witnesses with potential sightings over the years.</p>
      <p>She explained: "You never know when you're going to get a story that actually is true... and it could be the worst thing ever.</p>
      <blockquote>"But we don't know when that is. As we sit here this morning, there is nothing proven... it feels like forever already.</blockquote>
      <p>"Trevor would never give up on us - that's our commitment. As difficult as it is to deal with the speculation... we won't give up. We have to keep fighting through it until we find him."</p>
      <p>CCTV footage, which you can see below, shows the last known movements of Trevor Deely.</p>

      <p>Footage of the rear entrance of the premises at 3:35am shows an unknown man talking with Trevor at the back gate.</p>
      <p>This man has never been identified.</p>
      <p>Trevor was last seen on CCTV passing the since-removed Bank of Ireland ATM on Haddington Road at 4.14am.</p>
      <p>Around 30 seconds later, a man was captured on CCTV walking in the same direction as Trevor.</p>
      <p>Gardaí at Pearse Street Garda station are appealing for any information that could assist the investigation into Trevor's disappearance.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to contact Pearse Street Garda station on 01-666-9000, the Garda Confidential Line at 1800-666-111 or Crimestoppers on 1800-250-025.</p>
