        <b>Exes Madhurima Tuli and Vishal Aditya Singh are a part of Bigg Boss 13 and it is given that there will be clashes between the two. Today, we shall see them dragging their past and throwing some nasty accusations at each other</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chandrakanta stars Madhurima Tuli and Vishal Aditya Singh were once deeply in love with each other. However, they had a very nasty breakup and soon they turned enemies. They appeared on a dance reality show together as exes, and they couldn't stop screaming at each other. Now, the same has followed to Bigg Boss 13 house. Madhurima who entered as a wild card contestant last week will have a massive showdown with her ex Vishal Aditya Singh today. So much that they'll start screaming at each other and even start abusing.</p>
      <p>In the promo shared, we see Madhurima confronting Vishal over how he treats women. She said that he did not treat his girlfriend right and that he has no right to advice others on how they should deal with women. Vishal then goes on to talk about how abusive Madhurima was while in a relationship and that she even slapped him in front of everyone. Vishal says she shouldn't have come to Bigg Boss as her entry has made him uncomfortable and that's when Madhuri says 'Tumhare Baap Ka Show Hai?' The lady calls Vishal 'fake' while he calls her 'worthless'. Watch the video below:</p>

      <p>Well, this has left us pretty confused as just a few hours ago we saw Vikas Gupta trying to mend things between Vishal and Madhurima. In fact, in a video, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-uncensored-exes-madhurima-tuli-vishal-singh-s-differences-to-get-solved-courtesy-vikas-gupta/5dedeb30fc4a991fc3877d52">we also saw the lady walking up to Vishal in the night with a motive to talk</a>. We were hoping that things will get sorted between the two, but, now it seems highly unlikely.

      <p>Meanwhile, Paras Chhabra and Sidharth Shukla are witnessing all of this from a secret room. They are having their fun spying on all the contestants.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source: Twitter/colorstvÂ </i></p>
