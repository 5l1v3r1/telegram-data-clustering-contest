      <h3>What to look for in an electric bike</h3>
      <p>There are lots of different types of electric bikes, including mountain, road, hybrid, folding and more. Plus, there are various places the motor can live: the front or rear wheel, or by the cranks.</p>
      <p>More importantly is whether the motor uses a simple motion sensor or a more advanced torque sensor to decide how much power to apply. In short, it’s best to get a bike with a torque sensor – if you can afford the higher prices they command.</p>

      <h3>Best electric bike deals</h3>
      <h4>1. Assist Hybrid Electric Bike</h4>
      <figure>

        <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777764-19-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-electric-bike-deals-3777764%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbikes%2Felectric-bikes%2Fassist-hybrid-electric-bike-20-wheel">From: Halfords<br/>Was: £499<br/>Now: £398  (£101 off) <br/>View Deal</a>
      </p>
      <p>Even at the higher price, this is one of the cheapest electric bikes available in the UK, and this is a good discount of that. It's basic, there's no doubt of that, but if you want an electric bike on a tight budget without importing it from China, this is a good option.</p>
      <h4>2. Focus Whistler2 3.9 2019 Electric Hardtail Mountain Bike</h4>

      <p>
        <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777764-19-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-electric-bike-deals-3777764%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rutlandcycling.com%2Fbikes%2Felectric-bikes%2Ffocus-whistler2-39-2019-electric-hardtail-mountain-bike-grey_475464">From: Rutland Cycline<br/>Was: £1299<br/>Now: £749  (£550 off) <br/>View Deal</a>
      </p>
      <p>A great big 42% off the original price of this electric mountain bike makes the Focus Whistler2 a very good deal. The spec isn't what we'd call high end, and it wouldn't be great value at £1299, but at this price, you can probably live with Shimano Altus gears. </p>
      <p>Like <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/gtech-sport-electric-bike-3688366/">Gtech's Sport bike</a>, this one has no buttons or display on the handlebars: you simply turn it on and go.</p>
      <p>There's a choice of small, medium and large frames, with the latter two having 29in wheels and the small one coming with 27.5in. Note that none come with pedals!</p>
      <p>Even so, it's a lot of electric bike for the money.</p>
      <h4>3. Scott Aspect eRide 10 27.5” / 29er Mens Electric Hardtail Mountain Bike</h4>

      </p>
      <p>A high-end electric mountain bike, the Aspect e10 comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a Bosch CX system with a Purion display. Pedals aren't included with this model, but you can save an extra £150 of this price until 18 November using the code SAVE150 at the checkout.</p>
      <h4>4. Raleigh Felix 700c Crossbar Electric Hybrid Bike</h4>

        <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777764-19-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-electric-bike-deals-3777764%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbikes%2Felectric-bikes%2Fraleigh-felix-700c-crossbar-electric-hybrid-bike-46cm-53cm-frames">From: Halfords<br/>Was: £1799<br/>Now: £1619  (£180 off) <br/>View Deal</a>
      </p>
      <p>Using the Bosch Active Line crank-driven motor and torque sensor, the Felix is a well-equipped touring or commuting bike with 700c wheels. Despite the 300Wh battery, range is up to 60 miles. </p>
      <p>The discount isn't massive, but it's still worth having.</p>
      <h4>5. Ebco MH-5 Electric Mountain Bike</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/deal/3777746/ebco-deal_thumb450.jpg"/>

      <p>
        <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777764-19-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-electric-bike-deals-3777764%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbikes%2Felectric-bikes%2Febco-mh-5-electric-mountain-bike">From: Halfords<br/>Was: £1599<br/>Now: £1099  (£500 off) <br/>View Deal</a>
      </p>
      <p>The Ebco is a mid-range mountain bike with a large-capacity 400Wh battery that's good for 35-55 miles between charges. It comes in medium and large frame sizes and uses a mid-mounted motor.</p>
      <p>It's also good to see Tektro hydraulic disc brakes for good stopping power.</p>
      <p>It's a fine deal at this price.</p>
