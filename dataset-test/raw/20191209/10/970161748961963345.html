      <h1>Yoko Ono describes 'hollowing experience' of losing John Lennon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:12:32+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Moore</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday (8 December) marked the 39th anniversary of the death of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/john-lennon/">John Lennon</a>, with family, friends and fans all paying fresh tribute to the late <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-beatles/">Beatle</a>.</p>
      <p>Lennon’s widow <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/yoko-ono/">Yoko Ono</a> posted an emotional tribute to the musician on Twitter in which she described the process of losing a loved one as ‘a hollowing experience’.</p>
      <p>‘After 39 years, Sean, Julian and I still miss him,’ Yoko wrote, referencing Lennon’s two sons before quoting one of the most famous lyrics from Imagine: ‘Imagine all the people, living life in peace.’</p>

      <p>Yoko also took a renewed stand against gun violence in the US, pulling up a statistic which claimed that over 1.4 million people have been killed a a result of gun violence in the US since Lennon’s murder in New York in December 1980.</p>
      <p>‘Every day, 100 Americans are shot and killed with guns,’ she wrote. ‘We are turning this beautiful country into a War Zone.</p>
      <p>‘Together, let’s bring back America, the green land of Peace.’</p>

      <p>Six hours on from her original post, Yoko heartbreakingly added: ‘It is always good to cry. Tears gives you immense health.’</p>
      <p>Last month, Lennon’s Beatles bandmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ringo-starr/">Ringo Starr</a> recalled being told the devastating news of Lennon’s murder, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/ringo-starr-still-gets-emotional-bard-shot-john-lennon-recalls-beatles-death-11014723/">admitting that he ‘still well[s] up that some b*****d shot him’.</a></p>
      <p>‘We got a plane to New York, and you don’t know what you can do,’ the drummer said about what he did in the immediate aftermath of Lennon’s death.</p>
      <p>‘We went to the apartment. “Anything we can do?” And Yoko just said, “Well, you just play with Sean. Keep Sean busy.” And that’s what we did.’</p>
