      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598">The BBC</a> reports that Russia has been handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).</p>
      <p>It means the Russia flag and anthem will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and football’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>But athletes who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal will be able to compete under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>Wada’s executive committee made the unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>It comes after Russia’s Anti Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.</p>
      <p>It had to hand over data to Wada as a condition of its <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/45565273">controversial reinstatement in 2018</a> after a three-year suspension for its vast state-sponsored doping scandal.</p>
      <p>It has 21 days to appeal against the ban.</p>
      <p>A total of 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned at the 2014 Games in Sochi.</p>
      <p>Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015.</p>
      <p>Despite the ban, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 – in which St Petersburg will be a host city – as European football’s governing body Uefa is not defined as a ‘major event organisation’ with regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches.</p>
