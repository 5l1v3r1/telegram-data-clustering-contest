      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/liberal-democrats/index.html"><b>Lib Dem</b></a> leader Jo Swinson today revealed she has been urged to wear lower cut tops to boost her party's electoral chances.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said the extraordinary tip was among a welter of 'unsolicited advice' she has received on how to revive her flagging campaign.</p>
      <p>Fears have been mounting that the Lib Dems are failing to win over voters, with the party's 'hard Remain' stance and a Labour squeeze blamed for a slump in the polls.</p>
      <p>But Ms Swinson's own personal ratings have also been dire, now rivalling <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/jeremy_corbyn/index.html"><b>Jeremy Corbyn</b></a> at the bottom of the charts.  </p>
      <p>Pressed on BBC Breakfast today over what she could do to turn the situation around, Ms Swinson said people had been urging her to speak and dress differently.  </p>

      <p>She said: 'I get lots and lots of unsolicited advice. I'm not short of people telling me that I should speak differently or wear different shoes or wear different earrings. </p>
      <p>'Or in one case, somebody suggested that I should wear lower cut tops. </p>
      <p>'I mean as if that's going to be the thing that changes the poll rating. I'm not short of unsolicited advice.' </p>
      <p>Asked if the 'advice' was coming from her own election team, she said: 'Not in my election team, but as I say, I do get these gems of advice that come to me. </p>
      <p>'I am who I am and some people will not like the way that I dress or talk or my accent or whatever. </p>
      <p>'And fine. In a sense that's their problem. I'm going to stand here, do the best that I can arguing for the positions that I believe in because I do believe our politics can be better. </p>
      <p>'And I'm going to be true to myself in the way I do it.' </p>
      <p>Ms Swinson came under fire at a Channel 4 debate last night in which a furious voter accused her of being a 'Tory in disguise'. </p>
      <p>A woman in the audience said: 'You're a Tory in disguise, state what you are. You dare to try and raise taxes on lower earners when the country is in austerity. How dare you.'</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson replied to her critic by saying: 'And we need to end that [austerity] by investing in our public services and we need to be honest about how we do that.</p>
      <p>'If you look at the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, they have looked at the Labour plan and they say they are not credible.'</p>
      <p>The comeback saw shadow education secretary Angela Rayner launch into an angry tirade, yelling at the former coalition minister: 'You voted for the bedroom tax, you voted for austerity, you voted for tuition fees.</p>
      <p>'You did that nine years ago - apologise for tuition fees.'</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader responded by accusing Labour of 'making a list of promises that you cannot deliver'. </p>
      <p>Ms Swinson also brought up her cannabis use when asked to identify the 'naughtiest' thing she had ever done. </p>
      <p>'I did smoke a fair bit of cannabis at university,' she told PA. 'It wasn't just one, and I did inhale.</p>
      <p>'I don't know whether that counts as particularly naughty, but your readers and viewers will be able to make up their own mind on that.' </p>
