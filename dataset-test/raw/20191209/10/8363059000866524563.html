      <p>The thing on your phone you only ever open by accident may soon become a thing you occasionally open <i>on purpose</i>, should you be the owner or potential owner of an electric car. This is thanks to EV charge point specialist Zap-Map adding access to most of its database of chargers via the "OK Google" voice search, making it straightforward to find a charge location without getting done or publically shamed for looking at your phone while driving.</p>
      <p>Zap-Map says Android-powered smartphone users are able to use hands-free voice commands to order their telephone to find the nearest EV charge point; and results may then be filtered by charge speed, location, station operator or driving distance, with your virtual assistant also filled in on if the charger is working or out of order for some reason, and suggesting on-route locations if you're already on a satnav mission.</p>
      <p>Zap-Map's Ben Lane said: "We are providing a quick and simple way for EV drivers to find out information on charge points at home, on the move and, for the first time ever, hands-free when they most need it -- while driving."
