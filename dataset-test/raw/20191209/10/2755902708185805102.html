      <p>Heavy rains have devasted South Africa’s Gauteng Province after massive flash floods resulted in parts of the City of Centurion going underwater. Midrand and Pretoria have also been negatively affected, but the flooding is not quite as bad as that in Centurion.</p>
      <p>The rains which have been incessant for the past 5 days are so bad that the Centurion Lake Hotel has actually been flooded.</p>

      <p><i><b>In other news</b></i>: <b>Jacob Zuma Poisoned, Rushed To ‘Secret’ Hospital in Cuba for treatment?</b></p>
      <p>The rumour mill is on overdrive after suggestions that former<a href="https://iharare.com/jacob-zuma-switches-to-music/"> President Jacob Zuma was whisked away</a> “incognito” style to Cuba for an emergency medical procedure after sources claimed he was poisoned.</p>
      <p>This would be the second time Jacob Zuma would have been poisoned after the first attempt was allegedly orchestrated by his wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma, known as MaNtuli in 2014 whilst he was president. She was not prosecuted for the alleged poisoning attempt owing to an apparent total lack of evidence.</p>
      <p>South Africans, however, are not impressed with the news citing that the former president should be treated in South Africa and not Cuba.</p>
      <aside>Jacob Zuma is in Cuba receiving medical treatment over an allegation that he was poisoned. This guy is starting to get mad. He’s a mad man.<br/>— The Vendalist (@CadreFloyd) <a href="https://twitter.com/CadreFloyd/status/1203585582552760321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2019 </a><a href="https://iharare.com/jacob-zuma-poisoned-rushed-to-secret-hospital-in-cuba/"><i><b>CONTINUE READING ARTICLE</b></i></a></aside>
