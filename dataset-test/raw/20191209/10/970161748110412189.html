      <h1>Jose Mourinho makes approach to sign Marouane Fellaini for Tottenham</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:10:17+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author">Metro Sport Reporter</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> is attempting to sign Marouane Fellaini for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>, according to reports in Belgium.</p>
      <p>Mourinho managed Fellaini during their time together at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided to sell the midfielder earlier this year.</p>
      <p>But Belgian newspaper <a href="https://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/diablesrouges/mercato-marouane-fellaini-le-special-one-de-jose-mourinho-5ded53479978e272f96db972">La Derniere Heure</a> now reports that Mourinho has made the signing of Fellaini his ‘priority objective’ at Spurs.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Mourinho has even contacted Fellaini ahead of a potential move in the January transfer window.</p>

      <p>Fellaini is currently playing for Shandong Luneng in the Chinese Super League and the 32-year-old has scored seven goals and provided four assists in 22 league appearances for the club.</p>
      <p>Fellaini’s current contract with Shandong runs until December 2021 with an option of an additional year.</p>
      <p>But the Chinese Super League season has now ended and Fellaini will not be in action until March.</p>
      <p>During their time together at United, Mourinho was a huge advocate of Fellaini’s versatility and even described the Belgian as ‘fundamental’ after a 2-0 win over Burnley last season.</p>
      <p>‘Everybody knows Marouane is not Maradona but everyone knows what Marouane is and what he can give,’ Mourinho said last year.</p>
      <p>‘In this moment, especially this season and also last season he did many times what strikers couldn’t do which is score goals in important moments.</p>
      <p>‘I know him very well and I know the positions he can play, the jobs he can do, this season you saw him as a third central defender against Burnley and you saw him as a striker and as a number eight, which is basically the position where Marouane has more balance and know how but he’s very important in both boxes, in the first third and in the last third.’</p>
