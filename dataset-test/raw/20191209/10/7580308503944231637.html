      <p>Sugar – it is a craving most of us have. How could we not? It’s sweet and makes basically everything taste better. If you have ever tried to cut back on sugar, you know how difficult it can be. Some people could even experience withdrawal symptoms.</p>
      <p><b>Beware of Hidden Sugar!</b><br/>Sugar over the years has become part of our diets, considering that most of what we eat on this side of the world contains a high amount of it. So, are we talking about chocolates and candies? “No, it is not my case, I do not fond sweet treat.” Hold on, sometimes, our not-too-sweet food has what is called by “hidden-sugar”. In addition, we are just not aware of how much sugar it contains. Who likes to drink a cold soda in the middle of the day? Well, surprise surprise, a can of soda contains about 80% of your daily limit sugar intake!</p>

      <p><b>Sugar Addiction and Its Risks</b><br/>When we eat foods high in sugar, the part of our brain that is the “<b>reward center</b>” is activated. And at the same time, a large amount of dopamine is released. This is what makes eating sugar feels so good. Despite of its dopamine-boosting trait, sugar is not very healthy. Let’s first understand why sugar is so bad for us in order to make better choices regarding our diets.</p>
      <p>Experts believe that sugar over-consumption is a major cause of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes2. World Health Organization recommends reducing sugar intake at all stages of life to under 10 percent of physical calories to reduce its side effect. They believe a further reduction in free sugar intake to less than five percent of energy (i.e. no more than 4 tablespoons sugar for adults per day) would be sensible3.</p>
      <p>Here are some reasons why eating sugar is bad for your health2,3:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rates of obesity are rising worldwide and added sugar is thought to be one of the main culprits</li>
        <li>High-sugar diets have been associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including heart disease, the number one cause of death worldwide</li>
        <li>A study in 2,300 teens demonstrated that those who frequently consumed added sugar had a 30% greater risk of developing acne</li>
        <li>Obesity, which is often caused by consuming too much sugar, is considered the strongest risk factor for diabetes</li>
      </ul>
