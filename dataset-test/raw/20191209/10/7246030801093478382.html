      <h1>Kan 11 Poll: Blue&amp;White, Likud, Gain a Seat Each, Habayit Hayehudi Disappears</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:44:38+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/di/" target="_blank">David Israel</a></address>
      <p>A poll done for Kan 11 News on Sunday by the Canter Institute shows a small strengthening of both Blue&amp;White and Likud, at the expense of smaller parties in their respective blocs. This does not change the relationship between the blocs.</p>
      <p>The poll gives 35 seats to Blue&amp;White, and 34 to Likud.</p>
      <p>The Joint Arab List holds on to its 13 seats.</p>
      <p>Both United Torah Judaism and Shas get 8 seats each.</p>
      <p>Avigdor Liberman’s Israel Beiteinu is clipped down by one seat to 7.</p>
      <p>A Naftali Bennett-Ayelet Shaked New Right party gets 6 seats – up from 3.</p>
      <p>Labor-Gesher goes down to 5 seats from its current 6.</p>
      <p>The Democratic camp (Meretz) is also down by a seat, from 5 to 4.</p>
      <p>Both Habayit Hayehudi and Otzma Yehudit disappear from the political map – Habayit Hayehudi loses its current 4 seats and falls below the threshold vote.</p>
      <p>The left-center bloc remains, according to the survey results, at its current size of 44 seats.</p>
      <p>The rightwing bloc is strengthened by one mandate and rises to 56 at the expense of Israel Beiteinu.</p>
      <p>In response to the question whom they would prefer as the next prime minister, 41% of respondents preferred Benjamin Netanyahu, with Benny Gantz trailing with 38%, within the margin of error.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, according to the survey, 17% of Blue&amp;White voters prefer Gideon Sa’ar over Gantz for prime minister.</p>
      <p>The survey was conducted on Sunday, with 556 respondents selected out of 1,271 who were asked to participate online. The margin of error was +-4.3%.</p>
