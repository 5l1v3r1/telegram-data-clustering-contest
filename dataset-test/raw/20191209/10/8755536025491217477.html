      <p>The 35-year-old revealed she began her journey to gestational surrogacy in Kiev, Ukraine.<br/>“Back when we began the medical &amp; legal side of #oursurrogacyjourney in Feb 2018, we never dreamed that we’d be lucky enough to take our beautiful daughter home for Christmas the very next year.”<br/>Opening up about the process, Rosanna said it was “long, stressful and expensive.”<br/>“It’s a long, stressful, expensive process and there are no absolute guarantees.”</p>

      <p> At the beginning of this year, we spent a few weeks in Kiev for the egg retrieval process &amp; stayed beside St. Sophia’s Cathedral,” she said, explaining her daughter’s namesake.</p>
      <p>“The night before my procedure, we walked up to the cathedral in the freezing cold &amp; Wes Quirke took this photo… we both loved the name &amp; agreed that if we happened to have a baby girl, we’d name her Sophia as a nod to our long journey to become her parents (it also comes from the Greek word for wisdom!)”</p>
      <p>Rosanna concluded her heartfelt post by thanking everyone who “supported, guided and helped” over the “past couple of years,” adding; “you know who you are.”</p>
