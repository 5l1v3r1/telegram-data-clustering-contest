      <p>The capital punishment to the four culprits of the heinous 2012 Delhi gangrape case has once again come under a cloud of doubt as one of the convicts is ready to file a review petition against his death sentence.</p>
      <p>Akshay Thakur will file his review petition in Supreme Court, a few days after the home ministry recommended President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy plea filed by another accused Vinay Kumar.</p>
      <p>The SC has already rejected a similar plea filed by Vinay Kumar, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta.</p>
      <p>If the SC dismisses Akshay Thakur's review petition, he will have the option to file a mercy plea with the president.</p>
      <p>Six people were convicted of brutally raping a 23-year-old paramedic student now known as Nirbhaya while she was on her way back home on December 16, 2012. Nirbhaya later died of her injuries.</p>
      <p>The gangrape sparked a nationwide fury, which led to new legislation to deal with such heinous crimes.</p>
      <p>The six involved were arrested and convicted. One was minor and another, Ram Singh, committed suicide in Tihar Jail during trial.</p>
