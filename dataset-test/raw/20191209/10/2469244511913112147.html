      <p>Tributes have been paid to a well-known hair salon owner who has passed away after battling with ill health.</p>
      <p>Lavinia Cook was the proprietor of not one but five salons in and around Exeter before leaving Devon in 2004 and moving up north.</p>
      <p>She had three in St Thomas and two on the outskirts of Exeter, as well as seven mobile hairdressing vans for home clients.</p>
      <p>Such was her talent that she was asked by Ford Motors to design a hairstyle – The Capri – to coincide with the launch of the Ford Capri in 1969.</p>
      <p>It gained her much acclaim, as well as reluctant local celebrity status, and the name Lavinia Hair Fashions was known far and wide.</p>
      <p>Her father Wilfred, a notable trilby-wearing figure and much-loved businessman at this time, was her business partner and chief promoter, who wouldn’t let her talents go unnoticed.</p>
      <p>Lavinia, nee Hulland, was born in Exeter and met her husband Barry, who owned Nitty Gritty Now, in Exeter 52 years ago and they were married for 48 years. Together they had a child, Petena-Marie, and become grandparents to three grandchildren, Reece, James and Kyle.</p>
      <p>They moved to the north west in 2004 and had many happy years there, but she struggled with her health, although was always a challenge to her GP because she would said she was ‘fine’ whenever asked how she was.</p>
      <p>Lavinia had a life-saving operation in 2011, but told very little more than her family needed to know because she did not want to distress them.</p>
      <p>Barry said: “As she was a trooper in spirit through illness she did not want anyone to suffer because she was.</p>
      <p>“Lavinia was greatly loved and admired by all, and was often told, ‘don’t ever change’. She was at the very heart of my life. Losing my beautiful lady too soon has fractured my world.</p>
      <p>“She will be painfully missed."</p>
      <p>Lavinia passed away in Barry’s arms on October 3.</p>
