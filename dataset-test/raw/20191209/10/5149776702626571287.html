      <h1>'A name that slams you' - Francois Modesto's pride at Nottingham Forest role and looking for players</h1>
      <h2>The Reds' technical director spent time getting to know the Championship by travelling around the country in his car</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:19:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:19</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest technical director Francois Modesto says travelling around the country in his car, watching games, helps give him an idea of the type of players to recruit.</p>
      <p>And he has spoken of his pride at working for “such a mythical club” as the Reds.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman’s appointment was <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/sabri-lamouchi-reveals-new-duo-3444044">confirmed by the club in October</a> - along with head of international recruitment Jose Anigo - though the pair are understood to have already been working at the City Ground for some time before then.</p>
      <p>Modesto played a key role in Forest’s summer transfer business, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-news-sabri-lamouchi-3611812">as well as the arrival of head coach Sabri Lamouchi.</a></p>
      <p>And to help him adapt to the Championship, he spent time getting to know the league by going up and down the country watching games.</p>
      <p>Asked how he came to understand what is a new division for him, Modesto told <a href="https://www.sofoot.com/francois-modesto-nottingham-forest-est-un-geant-qui-dort-477145.html">So Foot</a>: “It’s simple. I left alone with my car to see matches in the Premier League, Championship and League One to understand this football.</p>
      <p>“Seeing it on TV is fine, but living it on a daily basis is something else.</p>
      <p>“Here you can go to a match every day.</p>
      <p>“Being on the ground is important, because you meet people, opposing clubs, mentality. You feel things, you impregnate yourself and then you can ask yourself to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-olympiacos-3609785">choose the players to recruit.</a></p>

      <p>“It was very important to come six months before, as an observer, to understand what is happening and to adapt. I'm coming to a foreign country, you have to respect that.</p>
      <p>“You must not change everything. I always say that when you are a foreign player, you have to adapt to the country, it is not the country that has to adapt to us. It's the same as a leader now.</p>
      <p>“I have to adapt to the people, the football and the club here, bringing our foreign touch that can perhaps improve some things.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-francois-modesto-marinakis-3613365">former Olympiacos chief scout</a> represented the likes of Monaco, Cagliari, Bastia and the Greek giants during his playing career.</p>
      <p>And he says he never imagined himself one day travelling around England in his car to look for players.</p>
      <p>“Never. But I believe a lot in destiny,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I remember when I was little, I must have been about 10 years old, I had seen an English League Cup final, which <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> had won.</p>
      <p>“It was a match that marked me because at the time, few games were broadcast.</p>
      <p>“In addition, when you're young, Nottingham Forest is a name that slams you. And at that time, the finals of the League Cup, I did not see many. It is Nottingham that I saw, not Liverpool, Manchester or I do not know which club.”</p>
      <p>Asked for what he thinks when he takes to the road in England, Modesto said: “I think I was a boy from Bastia who was born into a very average family, who did not think he could one day end up in England in such a mythical club.</p>
      <p>“I'm proud of it. It's a pride for me and for the name of my family to be here. It's beautiful.</p>
      <p>“There is everything to do to win this bet. But it's the beauty of football, which gives a lot of life possibilities.”</p>
