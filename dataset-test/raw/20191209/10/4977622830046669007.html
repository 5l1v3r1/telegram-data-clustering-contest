      <h1>Karnataka Bypolls: BJP In Commanding Position As It Leads In 11 Out Of 15 Seats; Congress Admits Defeat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:54:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>The B S Yediyurappa led Karnataka BJP has put itself in a commanding position in the Karnataka by-polls by leading in 11 out of the 15 assembly by-poll seats, <i>News18 Kannada </i>has reported.</p>
      <p>The Congress which too contested all the 15 assembly seats is leading in two seats while the H D Kumaraswamy led JD(S) is leading on one.</p>
      <p>Senior Congress leader D K Shivaumar was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-bypoll-results-live-updates-counting-of-votes-to-begin-at-8am/liveblog/72431614.cms">quoted</a> as admitting defeat by claiming that the rebel MLAs have been accepted by the people.</p>
      <p>This by-poll was necessitated after 15 Congress MLAs decided to rebel in the state which led to the dismissal of the Kumaraswamy led government. The rebels were later disqualified by the Supreme Court which led to the by-polls.</p>
      <p>The BJP currently has 106 seats in the state and if the trends stand, it will comfortably surpass the majority mark of 113.</p>
