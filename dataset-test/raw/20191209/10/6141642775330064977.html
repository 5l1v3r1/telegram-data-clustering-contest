      <p>Climate change activists wearing gas masks blocked a central London road to demand the next government tackles “deadly levels of air pollution” in the capital.</p>
      <p>Six Extinction Rebellion protesters dressed in hi-vis suits glued their hands to yellow breeze-blocks in the middle of Cranbourn Street, outside Leicester Square Tube station.</p>
      <p>The demonstration, called The Air We Grieve, involved 25 cement blocks which the activists said represents the number of Londoners who die each day as a result of air pollution.</p>
      <p>A van parked sideways next to them was emblazoned with a sign reading: “Air Pollution Kills 25 Londoners Each Day”.</p>

      <p>A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: “Police are aware of a small number of protesters outside Leicester Square Underground station.</p>
      <p>“Officers are in attendance.”</p>
      <p>One protester, teacher Rosamund Frost, said: “We are here demanding action on illegal levels of toxic air in our communities, our schools and our streets.</p>
      <p>“In February 2017, the European Commission issued a ‘final warning’ to the UK over illegal levels of air pollution.</p>
      <p>“In May that year, after the Government failed to take decisive action, they were taken to Europe’s highest court, the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p>“The Government have neglected to tackle fatal levels of air pollution. How can we put our trust in them to address the broader climate and ecological emergency?”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other Extinction Rebellion protesters were entering their fourth week on hunger strike outside political party headquarters in Westminster.</p>
      <p>The strikers, including 76-year-old grandfather Peter Cole, have sent a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, inviting him to discuss the climate and ecological emergency with them on Monday.</p>
