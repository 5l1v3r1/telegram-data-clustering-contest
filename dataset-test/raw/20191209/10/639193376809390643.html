      <p>Metallurgical coal project developer Aspire Mining has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sinosteel Equipment &amp; Engineering (Sinosteel MECC) to develop Mongolia’s Ovoot coking coal project.</p>
      <p>The non-binding agreement covers potential engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) as well as trade-based funding opportunities for the Ovoot Early Development Project (OEDP).</p>
      <p>Aspire Mining’s MoU comes after the company completed a $33.5m placement with shareholder Tserenpuntsag Tserendamba earlier this month, increasing the latter’s stake in the company from 27.5% to 51%.</p>
      <p>The pre-feasibility study (PFS) of the OEDP includes construction of a five million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP) at the Ovoot mine site. The construction cost of the CHPP is estimated at $37m.</p>
      <p>Under the MoU with Sinosteel, Aspire Mining is required to share information on the mine development pertaining to permitting and licenses, transport logistics and project financing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the company will also be allowed to access Sinosteel’s Coal Trading Platform, through which coal can be sold on a spot basis in China.</p>
      <p>Aspire Mining executive chairman David Paull said: “Aspire recognises the importance of having a strong partnership with companies like Sinosteel MECC that play such a major role in the Chinese steel industry, the main market for Ovoot’s high-quality coking coal product.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to working alongside Sinosteel MECC as one of our key partners in bringing the Ovoot Early Development Project into production and delivering value for all shareholders.”</p>
      <p>The company expects to complete a definitive feasibility study (DFS) around May next year, subject to receiving the necessary permits and approvals to complete drilling of the mine.</p>
      <p>If financing is secured and all permits are received by the first quarter of next year, Aspire Mining expects to begin pre-stripping of waste at Ovoot from the third quarter of the same year.</p>
