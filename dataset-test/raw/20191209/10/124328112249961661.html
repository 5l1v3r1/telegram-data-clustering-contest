      <p>A British tourist allegedly stole a coach in Benidorm before going on a two-mile, high-speed wrecking spree and smashing into cars and motorbikes.  </p>
      <p>The vehicle was taken from a depot on the outskirts of the Spanish town where it had been left for the night before being driven at speed through the holiday resort.</p>
      <p>The unnamed 27-year-old, believed to be a drunken tourist although officials have yet to comment, is said to have got into a room where the key was kept before making off with one of the vehicles.</p>
      <p>Footage of his wild drive showed him smashing into mopeds and cars parked by the side of the road.</p>

      <p>A police car was also damaged during the drama, which happened around 3.30am on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Overnight reports citing local council sources pointed to the detainee possibly being a foreign tourist.</p>

        <figcaption>The coach can be seen ploughing into mopeds and bikes at the roadside</figcaption>

      <p>Police sources confirmed this morning he was a British national, although they offered no information on his age and what might have prompted his wrecking spree.</p>
      <p>One local said: 'It was lucky there were few people around at that time of the night otherwise things could have turned out a lot worse.</p>
      <p>'A lot of cars and motorbikes have been damaged but no-one fortunately has been hurt that I know of.'</p>
      <p>The coach was taken from a car park near a sports centre known locally as the Palau d'Esports l'Illa on the outskirts of Benidorm.</p>
      <p>It was driven towards the town centre and into a neighbourhood known as Els Tolls, even passing by the local police HQ at one point before being stopped in a road called Belgium Avenue which is Avenida de Belgica in Spanish.</p>
      <p>Separate footage showed the coach on the kerb after it was brought to a stop surrounded by several police cars.</p>
      <p>The witness who took the video said: 'There it is. I don't know if someone stole it. It was driven up three or four streets the wrong way.</p>
      <p>'It was absolute madness. He's destroyed everything, a load of cars and this is where he has parked it. The side of the coach is really damaged.'</p>

        <figcaption>The coach has extensive damage down its right side after scraping vehicles and bikes on its way</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Another witness called Chris Garrido said: 'I saw it enter my street last night from my flat. I saw everything, how it smashed up mopeds in front of the police station and smashed a wing mirror and the back of a police van.</p>
      <p>'It crashed into three cars at the start of the street and several mopeds and cars as well as metal bollards, and that was just in Grecia Street.</p>
      <p>'I don't know if it was the normal driver of the vehicle and he was p***ed up or someone who was also p***ed up and had stolen it.'</p>
      <p>Local Francisco Medina added on social media: 'Benidorm doesn't change.</p>

      <p>'Us Spanish are being hit with taxes everywhere and the English do what they like and nothing happens.'  </p>
      <p>The exact number of vehicles damaged has yet to be disclosed.</p>
      <p>The suspect has been handed over to the National Police force and is expected to appear in court later today or tomorrow on suspicion of stealing a vehicle and road traffic offences.</p>
      <p>He would have been breathalysed and made to take a drugs test, but the results of the tests have not been made public yet.</p>
