      <p>A weather warning has been issued for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Ayrshire</a> tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Forecasters put in place the yellow warning for wind and rain following a weekend of bad weather.</p>

      <p>The wind warning reads: "Very strong south to southwesterly winds are expected to develop across parts of Wales, England and Scotland during Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Winds will strengthen through the morning with gusts of 50-60 mph likely inland, and 60-70 mph around some coasts and over higher ground.</p>
      <p>"The strongest winds will probably occur ahead of an intense band of rain that is expected to move quickly eastwards during the day, winds easing once this clears."</p>
      <p>The rain warning states: "Rain, heavy at times will cross Scotland during Tuesday accompanied by strong and gusty winds.</p>
      <p>"Rainfall accumulations widely 20 to 40mm locally 60mm over high ground of western Scotland.</p>

        <li>Spray and flooding on roads probably making journey times longer</li>
        <li>Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely</li>
