      <p>Steve Bruce remains convinced that Joelinton will come good in the Newcastle United number 9 shirt.</p>
      <p>The Toon head coach will continue to persevere with the Brazilian and has also assigned Andy Carroll to work closely with him at the training ground as he gets through a testing early spell in his Premier League career.</p>
      <p>Joelinton managed to win a host of aerial challenges against Southampton but did not come close to ending his goal drought.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/tottenham-0-1-newcastle-match-16815686">He last scored in August at Spurs</a>, but Bruce said: "It’s that confidence one with him (Joelinton).</p>
      <p>"He’s got to learn from big Andy, to help him.</p>
      <p>"He’s new into the Premier League and is only young, and of course a lot of things get labelled at him with the big price tag.</p>
      <p>"I’m still convinced he will be a big asset to us.</p>
      <p>"He’s learning, and like everyone who comes to the Premier League, he’s finding it’s not easy.</p>
      <p>"At the moment, for Jo, it’s not easy."</p>
