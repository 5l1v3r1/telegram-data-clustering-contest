      <h1>Woman opens shop selling black dolls as a way to cope with grief</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:33:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Faima Bakar</a></address>
      <p>Sanda Monero started making dolls as a form of therapy, during a time she was struggling.</p>
      <p>After being inspired by the woman in her life, Sandra made black dolls with different shades and hairstyles.</p>
      <p>What started as a hobby grew and grew and last year Sandra, from Stoke Newington, decided to open her own store called Monero Kids Boutique in Balls Pond Road.</p>
      <p>As well as her ‘gratitude dolls’, Sandra, who has also worked in social care, also sells eco-friendly children’s clothing and educational books.</p>
      <p>Sandra takes inspiration from her St Lucian heritage and upbringing in London and uses Caribbean and African fabrics such as Kente cloth in her work.</p>
      <p>Currently, she has a range of dolls clothing in production with one for every Caribbean island.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are thousands of islands, which would take forever to create so Sandra is sticking to approximately 26 dolls.</p>
      <p>Her idea started when she lost her parents and her brother – something she still finds difficult to talk about – but she says that having the focus of creating doll clothes has helped to bring her happiness back.</p>
      <p>She hopes to introduce two male dolls – one to represent her father and one for her older brother.</p>
      <p>‘It is very important as [these dolls] represents little girls and boys’ Sandra told Metro.co.uk.</p>

      <p>‘Growing up, I only knew about Barbie and Sindy and of course, I wanted to be like them.</p>
      <p>‘But being a black child it was impossible as it did not represent me at all. I am so lucky, now, I am in a position to be able to share and showcase dolls for boys and girls that represent their colour tone.’</p>

      <p>There are three main dolls in the Monero Doll collection –  Honey, Ellie and Harley D.</p>
      <p>One of the dolls, Ellie, is named after Sandra’s mum who she describes as a ‘beautiful, graceful woman’.</p>
      <p>She adds: ‘Honey, is named after a friend of mine called Yinka who has supported and helped me through my challenges.</p>

      <p>‘Harley D is named after the Harley Davidson motorcycle as I have a passion for bikes. In addition, her character is partly built around myself and the daughter I would have had.’</p>
      <p>She recalls one of her favourite memories in at the Boutique when a little white girl called Hannah came in.</p>

      <p>‘She came in and bought the darkest doll,’ said Sandra. ‘When asked why she had chosen that one she said: “Mummy, she looks like my best friend Yemi”.’</p>
      <p>If you want to visit Sandra’s store, you can find it in Dalston Junction at 26a Balls Pond Road, London N1 4AU.</p>
