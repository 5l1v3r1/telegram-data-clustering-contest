      <p>Lorraine Kelly accidentally put her foot in it while grilling I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> about his first night with girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury.</p>
      <p>The radio DJ came third behind Andy Whyment and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/won-im-celebrity-2019-winner-live-final-11411152/">Queen of The Jungle </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> last night in another nail-biting finale which saw more than 11 million viewers vote to crown their champion. Although,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/outrage-no-one-meets-roman-kemp-bridge-following-im-celebrity-exit-11412968/"> no one welcomed him when he left the jungle.</a></p>
      <p>Naturally, everyone wanted to know what Roman did immediately after bursting through the doors of his lavish suite at the Versace Hotel in Brisbane, only Lorraine got slightly flustered when she realised she may have gone too far.</p>

      <p>‘Tell me, as soon as you got back to that hotel and you gave Anne-Sophie a hug, what else did you do?’ the host began before jumping off her seat to explain herself.</p>
      <p>‘You don’t have to tell me as much! I meant food… and things like that,’ she squirmed.</p>
      <p>Yeah Lorraine, come on’ Roman teased, rolling his eyes.</p>

      <p>Actually, Roman revealed he just rubbed his hands through the carpet and lived out his dreams with a hot shower.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old also admitted he’s ‘flattered’ by flirtations from Love Island winner Amber Gill, but he’s more than happy with his ‘missus’.</p>
      <p>‘I’m flattered but it was an amazing moment when I saw my missus, I missed her so much,’ he stressed.</p>
      <p>Following his exit Roman told hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly: ‘I’ve never had more fun… I couldn’t be more grateful.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘It’s a strange place down there, it’s an unnatural thing that forms a family within three weeks.’</p>

During her stay in the jungle, it was reported she spoke to husband Dan Osborne in unaired scenes over allegations he cheated on the former EastEnders actress with Love Island’s Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>He was also accused of enjoying a threesome with his Celebrity Big Brother co-stars Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling. He’s denied both reports.</p>
