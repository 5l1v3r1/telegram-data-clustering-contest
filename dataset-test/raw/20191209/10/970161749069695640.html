      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> is a treasure trove for so-bad-it’s-good Christmas movies – shout out to The Princess Switch and the entire A Christmas Prince franchise.</p>
      <p>But a new festive series has landed on the streaming platform that actually just falls into the good category.</p>
      <p>It’s a Christmas miracle!</p>
      <p>Norwegian mini-series Home For Christmas (Hjem til jul) is delighting binge-watchers thanks to its whip-smart humour and clever twist on all the Christmas rom-com tropes.</p>
      <p>The six-episode series stars Ida Elise Broch as Johanne, a 30-year-old who is smashing it in her job as a nurse and is surrounded by brilliant friends.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But as it hits December, her family only want to know one thing – when is she going to get a boyfriend?</p>
      <p>Johanne is already feeling insecure as the ‘single and childless’ are forced to pick up Christmas Eve shifts, her friends with babies bond over the new level of tiredness that only parents can feel, and she runs into her perfect ex who has gone on to get married and have a kid, but when her mother seats her between her twin nephews at the dinner table, enough is enough.</p>
      <p>To shut her family up, Johanne lies and says she has a boyfriend who she will bring along to dinner on Christmas Eve – meaning she has 24 days to find a man.</p>
      <p>With the help of her housemate, Johanne gets on the dating apps to find her Christmas bae, but between hooking up with a 19-year-old, entering an escape room with a ‘psychopath’ and injuring her crotch while spinning, it’s not all that easy.</p>
      <p>While the whole ‘single at Christmas’ thing has been done, Home For Christmas is a fresh look at the pressures of dating at 30 – think Bridget Jones but with Tinder in Norway – and even mocks its inspiration with a Love Actually inspired moment that goes on to point out everything wrong with the Christmas classic.</p>
      <p>And those who have discovered the Norwegian series (which comes with English subtitles) are obsessed:</p>

      <p>Home For Christmas only dropped on 5 December, but thanks to the series’ ending, people are already wondering if 2020 will bring a second series of the show.</p>
      <p>Please, Santa, we’ll be good!</p>
