      <p>EAST FLATBUSH, Brooklyn (WABC) -- An off-duty officer is due in court after he was arrested and charged in a deadly two-car crash in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>It happened <a href="https://abc7ny.com/off-duty-police-officer-faces-manslaughter-charge-in-deadly-brooklyn-crash/5740739/">early Sunday morning</a> at East 55th and Foster Avenue in East Flatbush.</p>
      <p>A black Mazda SUV was T-boned by a high-end Nissan GTR driven by 47-year-old off-duty NYPD Officer Rohan Shaw.</p>
      <p>He's now charged with vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, a speed violation and driving while ability impaired, which is a lesser charge than DWI.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Mazda SUV took off.</p>
      <p>A 22-year-old woman in the SIV was taken to Kings County Hospital in serious condition and another passenger, 23-year-old Joanna Dixon died.</p>
      <p>"She does a lot of volunteer work and she's always an outgoing person," Dixon's friend said. "Outgoing personality, she's belongs to a volunteer organization, very outgoing and has a lot of potential of being career-oriented."</p>
      <p>Friends and family left candles and flowers to remember her.</p>
      <p>Shaw is due in court in Brooklyn later Monday.</p>
