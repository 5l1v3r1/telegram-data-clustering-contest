      <p>Steve Thomson has made it official.</p>
      <p>Widely rumoured not to be seeking re-election in the next provincial election, Thomson issued a statement Monday confirming so.</p>
      <p>“Today, I want to thank my family, colleagues, constituents, and volunteers who have supported me since I first ran to become a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.</p>
      <p>“Serving as the MLA for Kelowna-Mission has been the experience of a lifetime, and an absolute honour. However, I have decided that I will not be standing for re-election in the next provincial election. It is now time to pass the torch to the next generation of leadership in Kelowna-Mission.</p>
      <p>“Having served as a government minister, a member of the Treasury Board, and even briefly as Speaker of the House, I look forward to sharing everything I have learned in over a decade in politics with those who will put their names forward to seek to represent this great community.</p>
      <p>“Thank you again to everyone who supported or accompanied me on this incredible journey. It has been an honour to serve the people of Kelowna-Mission all these years. I look forward to continuing to work hard for the community and for the province until the next election and beyond.”</p>
      <p>Thomson, a BC Liberal, was first elected in 2009 and was re-elected in 2013 and 2017. He served as Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations and Minister of Agriculture and Lands.</p>
      <p>Prior to entering politics, he was executive director of the BC Agriculture Council and general manager of the BC Fruit Growers Association.</p>
