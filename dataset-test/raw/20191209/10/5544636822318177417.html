      <p>A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Joshua Alobo, has claimed that his party originated hate speech.</p>
      <p>Alobo who is also a human rights advocate was speaking in a reaction to the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/12/06/sowore-dss-finally-re-arrests-activist-in-court-video/">re-arrest of the Convener of the RevolutionNow Omoyele Sowore.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/12/05/sowore-finally-released-after-four-months-in-dss-custody/">Sowore who was released on bail by the DSS on Thursday</a> last week was re-arrested in a courtroom by the DSS the following day.</p>
      <p>According to the APC chieftain, what the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari interprets as hate speech originated from the APC.</p>
      <p>He admitted that he was “seriously embarrassed” by the treatment meted out to Sowore who was “among those who canvassed for the ‘change’ mantra.”</p>
      <p>Alobo told Channel TV’s Sunrise Daily, Monday, that  “APC, in which I am a chieftain, originated hate speech.</p>
      <p>“Look at what happened at… even Lai Muhammed and the rest, nobody was arrested. Look at the fuel subsidy protest at the freedom square.</p>
      <p>“If not that Jonathan was proactive to deploy soldiers…I was in Abuja; even though I wasn’t in the general protest, I was using my vehicle to monitor the whole situation.</p>
      <p>“So a lot of showbiz was going on during the Jonathan administration, they don’t look at it as a threat to the government. What is Sowore?</p>
      <p>“They are just making the guy to[sic] be too popular, I don’t know him as a person. But they have been reading Sahara Reporters right from Jonathan era, a lot of information has been disclosed and all those things.</p>
      <p>Alobo, President of the International Human Rights and Development Centre asked: “So if a media practitioner cannot express his opinion, then what will he do?</p>
      <p>“And this is a man that has the pedigree of activism right from University. So, the DSS for goodness sake should not bring another terrorist group.</p>
      <p>“It is the suppression of Yusuf Muhammed that escalated into what we have now as Boko Haram.”</p>
