      <p>Last week’s weekend ka vaar at Bigg Boss 13 house made some big revelations and host Salman Khan lost his cool not once but twice. This weekend Salman revealed some secrets about Arhaan Khan to Rashami Desai and the whole nation went crazy and started the hashtag #StayStrongRashami. This week eviction was Himanshi Khurana.</p>
      <p>Asim Riaz has been very vocal about his feelings for Himanshi Khurana. But Himanshi revealed that she’s already in a relationship with someone but can’t reveal him on national television.

      <p>Talking about where she stands with Asim, Himanshi said, “In majority, I feel happy that people loved us inside. At least, they understand that I was clear in my point and he was clear in his. He and I are very good friends. It takes guts to say what he said on the show knowing that I can’t cross my limits. There are so many friends who might end up liking you but not necessary that they have the wrong motive behind it.”</p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 is extended by five weeks because of the enormous response show has been getting. We can’t wait to see who takes the Bigg Boss 13 trophy home this time.</p>
