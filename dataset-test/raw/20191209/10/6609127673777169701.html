      <p>But after Forster’s heroics against <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> in Sunday’s Betfred Cup final, Lennon wants to sign him for keeps.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old is paid £90,000 a week with the Premier League strugglers with two and a half years still to run on his contract.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celts</a> pay a significant percentage of his current salary as things stand — but Lennon is hopeful a deal can be thrashed out to bring the keeper back to the club next season.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s about affordability but that’s something we can talk about.</p>

      <p>“I’ll talk to the player but first we have to make the call to Southampton and I’ll need to speak to Peter Lawwell about that.</p>
      <p>“Is it beyond us? I don’t know. Would I love to do it? Of course, but we have to be realistic at times and we can’t go overboard either.</p>
      <p>“We have to be prudent but we have him right now and it’s fantastic because he’s definitely made us better.”</p>
      <p>Lennon signed Forster on a loan deal and there’s <b>NOT</b> a clause in the agreement which would allow Saints to recall the keeper next month.</p>
      <p>He added: “If we only have him for a year, we’ll try to enjoy him while he’s here.</p>
      <p>“He’s really happy - you can see that in his body language. He had a really difficult 18 months but for him to be back, he is so happy.”</p>

      <p>Lennon insists Forster should be back in contention for the England squad and urged Gareth Southgate to give him a recall.</p>
      <p>He added: “I think he’s better now than he was before and I certainly think Gareth should have a look at him. He’s been unbelievable. He’s more mature.</p>
      <p>“He just wasn’t getting beat on Sunday, just not getting beat.</p>
      <p>“He was absolutely remarkable and to do that in the context of a final, speaks volumes for his talent.</p>
      <p>“He’s done it in Europe as well against a class side like Lazio, who beat Juventus the other night. It speaks volumes for the performance we put in when we were away and also at home.</p>
      <p>“He is definitely in brilliant form and better than first time round.</p>
      <p>“So, yes, I think he should be looked at regarding England and yes, we have to see on the other question.”</p>
      <p>Lennon will now <b>REST</b> Forster for Thursday’s meaningless game against Cluj in Romania with Craig Gordon set to play.</p>
      <p>He added: “What I’ve got now are three top-class goalkeepers.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult for Craig because he’s not done a lot wrong and, to be fair, Scotty Bain hasn’t, either.</p>
      <p>“The opportunity to sign Fraser came around and I just thought ‘I can’t miss out on this one’ and, thankfully, it’s turned out to be the right call.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to start Craig in Thursday to give him a game and keep him motivated and ticking over.</p>
      <p>“It’s very difficult with goalkeepers but it was my call and sometimes you have to make these decisions for what you think is best for the team and the club.”</p>
