Countries vary when it comes to crypto regulations. Simply put, what may apply within a country may not apply in another one. Even in the United States, there are times states may vary when it comes to cryptocurrency regulations. <br/><br/>Before deciding to sign up with any platform, ensure to always know whether its operations are in line with the legal stipulations of your location.  <br/><br/><b>Reputation and authenticity </b><br/>There is one major problem about the cryptocurrency market at the moment which is the fact that barriers for getting into it are very few. This gives room for fraudulent dealers to get both potential and existing investors ripped off. <br/><br/>Before deciding to register with any exchange, try to find out whether it has been registered as a company.

While experts have predicted that this problem may not get better, there is still need for you to find out platforms which have improved security measures to ensure your investments are protected in the best way possible. A typical example of security challenges is the issue of $137million which was reportedly missing in QuadrigaCX after the demise of its founder. <br/><br/><b>Liquidity</b> <br/>The higher the trade volumes; the higher the liquidity will be. It means your chosen exchange will be able to handle your orders much quicker. Avoid those exchanges that have very low trade volumes as this can affect your business more than imagined. <br/><br/><b>Customer Support</b><br/>This entails trying to sign up with a platform where there is great support.
