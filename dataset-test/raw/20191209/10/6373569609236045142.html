      <p>Ryan Lowe has admitted that Plymouth Argyle loan signing George Cooper has given him food for thought over a possible return to his starting line-up.</p>
      <p>Cooper provided a creative spark for <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> when he played as a second half substitute in the away League Two game against Cambridge United on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was not enough to save them from a 1-0 defeat at the Abbey Stadium, but Cooper staked a claim for a first team place.</p>
      <p>The versatile 23-year-old was Plymouth Live’s Argyle player-of-the-month for October but has been on the bench for the last five games.</p>
      <p>Cooper played at right wing-back after replacing Joe Edwards in the 65th minute at Cambridge.</p>
      <p>The loan signing from Peterborough United has also previously been used by Lowe in one of the central midfield roles in his favoured 3-1-4-2 formation.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “It has been a bit frustrating for George because he came in and had a wonderful four games – or three-and-a-half, I would say.</p>
      <p>“We know what George gives us. He gives us that quality and it’s one of them – where do you find George in his best position?</p>
      <p>“Is it wing-back? Is it one of the number eight slots? But, as you have seen, the eights in Danny Mayor and (Antoni) Sarcevic have been outstanding.</p>
      <p>“The wing-backs have been outstanding but, yes, it definitely gives you food for thought (the way he played against Cambridge).</p>

      <p>Cooper gave Argyle an extra attacking impetus when he was sent on for Edwards.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “That’s why we put him on there, to get up and down that right side, coming in on his left foot.</p>
      <p>“We have to look at the overall package and (Callum) McFadzean has been outstanding on the left side and Joe Edwards on the right side.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough to balance, but we know what George gives us.</p>
      <p>“Defensively, he’s not quite switched on as much as I would like but that’s because he’s an attacking player.</p>
      <p>“He always gives us food for thought. He’s a superb talent.”</p>
      <p>Cooper was the second of three substitutes used by Lowe against Cambridge, with Joel Grant the first one when he replaced Conor Grant in the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>Grant went up front with Dom Telford while Byron Moore moved to the left wing-back role.</p>
      <p>Then, in the 73rd minute, striker Billy Clarke replaced Telford, who had started his first match since late September after a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “Joel came on just after half-time and gave us food for thought. Byron going out on the left gave us food for thought.</p>

      <p>“They all give us food for thought when they come on and give us an impact.</p>
      <p>“Billy didn’t have much to do but he came on and got hold of the ball. That’s what I want, when my players are coming off the bench to have an impact.</p>
      <p>“They certainly did that but it just wasn’t to be that we could get an equaliser.”</p>
