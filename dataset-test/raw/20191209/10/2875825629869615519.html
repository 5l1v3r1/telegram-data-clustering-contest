      <p>The heartbroken bride, 28, shared a poignant video of herself being fitted for her beautiful wedding dress as she revealed their nearly two-year romance is over.</p>
      <p>Weeks after having gushed about her excitement for their big day in September 2020, Danielle spoke of her heartache.</p>
      <p>"It isn't just cancelling a wedding, it's saying goodbye to the vision you had for the rest of your life after that day," she wrote.</p>

      <p>"The venue, the laughter, the family members and the start of a journey with someone who you love and who will love you for the rest of your life, no matter what, for better or worse. The places you would live and the things you would see together."</p>
      <p>She went on: "I am not posting this for sympathy but for my own closure. I’m saying goodbye to the girl in this dress, I’m saying goodbye to her for good. It's been pretty traumatising for me having to come to terms with everything lol but I'm only looking forward from now on. God has a different plan for my life - I hope the next chapter is the best one yet."</p>

      <p>As fans flocked to ask what went wrong, Danielle returned to her caption to add: "The details are between Jonny &amp; I. We have some amazing beautiful memories together which I will always cherish and I wish him nothing but happiness and success with everything he does in his life."</p>
      <p>But a pal told Mirror Online Danielle had been worried that Jonny, also 28, had been cheating on her behind her back.</p>

      <p>"She had to cancel the wedding - they couldn't go on like this. She's done with their relationship, there's no hope of a reconciliation whatsoever.</p>
      <p>"He's just not the man she thought he was."</p>
      <p>The couple found love in February 2018, after Jonny's messy split from Stephanie Pratt.</p>
      <p>Danielle, who was previously in a relationship with TOWIE's Elliott Wright, confirmed they were engaged in December last year, after Jonny popped the question during a romantic break in Switzerland.</p>

      <p>"It sounds clichè, but I knew from the first time I met this girl that I was going to marry her," Jonny wrote on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to announce the news.</p>
      <p>"I probably would've proposed to her within the first month of knowing her if it wasn't totally weird! She's basically the girl version of me and gets me in every way humanly possible.. She's a beautiful, caring soul inside and out."</p>
      <p>Since their split, believed to be at the end of November, Jonny has been sharing snaps of himself lapping up the sun in Bali and boarding a private jet.</p>
