      <p>Hundreds of tourists were near <b>New Zealand</b>'s island when a <b>volcano</b> erupted there, the Associated Press reported, citing country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Some people have been injured and others are still missing.</p>
      <p>The <b>volcano</b> began erupting at 2.30pm local time on Monday. <b>White Island</b> is located about 50 km off the North Shore's eastern coast and is often frequented by tourists.</p>
      <p><b>New Zealand</b> Prime Minister <b>Jacinda Ardern</b> said there were "a number" of tourists on or around the island, both from <b>New Zealand</b> and overseas.</p>
      <p>"I know there will be a huge amount of concern and anxiety for those who have loved ones at the island at that time - and I can assure them police are doing everything they can," she said.</p>
      <p>According to her, there seems to be no danger to people in coastal areas distant from the volcano.</p>
      <p>Smoke from the eruption is also visible from the continental part, and the National Emergency Response Agency has warned that some areas may be affected by the burning ash.</p>
      <p>According to local media, there were many people around and on the island. </p>
      <p>The island's <b>volcano</b> is one of the most active in New Zealand. Twelve people died on the island in 1914, when sulfur was obtained from it. Part of the <b>volcano</b>'s crater has collapsed and the collapse has destroyed the mining village and the mine itself.</p>
      <p>The <b>White Island</b> is also known as  Whakaari.</p>
