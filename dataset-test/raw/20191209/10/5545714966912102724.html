      <p><i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> really falls into that "single developer" category that's been so prevalent in the 2010s.</p>
      <p>Scott Cawthon is responsible for a multi-million-dollar empire, alongside of recent solo studio names like Matt Thorson, Toby Fox and Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. It really is amazing when you think about it, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../five-nights-at-freddy-s-quadrilogy-scaring-up-a-storm-on-consoles-today-573666.phtml">a recent string of Switch eShop releases</a> got me thinking: how much of the general public plays <i>Five Nights</i>?</p>
      <p>Me? I like to dabble in a bit of everything. Some of it's for research, and the rest I just have no excuse: I love games of all shapes and sizes. Also, I have young cousins and neighbors who constantly ask me if I play it (and <i>Minecraft/Fortnite/Roblox</i>) so I like to have an answer ready.</p>
      <p>You've probably seen the merch at some point (or the above Fazbear/friends face), but let us know if you've ever played a <i>Five Nights</i>Â game before.</p>
