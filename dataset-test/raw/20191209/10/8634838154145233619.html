        <b>Airtel Kenya on Monday, December 9, launched no expiry data and call rates that will allow customers to spend as low as 1 bob for 5MB data and to make calls at 2bob across all networks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, the company also revamped its entire Amazing data bundle offerings to give more data for the same cost as before e.g. 3GB for Kshs300 up from 1.5GB, 5GB for Kshs500 up from 4GB and 12GB for Kshs1000 up from 10GB with 30days validity.</p>
      <p>The new offerings are targeted towards customers who are looking to meet their communication needs with ease and not worry about any hidden costs or conditions. To active the new rates, customers need to dial <b>*544*2#</b>.</p>
      <p>The new products campaign dubbed ‘<b>BeSureNaAirtel’</b> is pegged on showing customers the exact rates and value they get for their investment. The new offers have no hidden charges or conditions for use, thus customers are assured of getting what they pay for at the most competitive rates.</p>
