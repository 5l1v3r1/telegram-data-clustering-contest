      <p><b>Los Angeles</b> - Actor Rene Auberjonois, known for his television roles on "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and the US sitcom "Benson," died Sunday in Los Angeles after a battle with cancer. He was 79.</p>
      <p>"We are heartbroken to confirm that Rene passed away today," a statement on the actor's website said.</p>
      <p>In his official biography, the cause given was metastatic lung cancer.</p>
      <p>Auberjonois earned legions of fans for his role as Odo, the shape-shifting head of security on "Star Trek Deep Space Nine," one of the many spinoff series spawned by the legendary science fiction show.</p>
      <p>He became a fan favorite at 'Star Trek' conventions for years, donating the proceeds from autographed items to charities, such as Doctors Without Borders.</p>
      <p>"I have had my share of successes and my share of flops. But nothing has ever been like this. 'Deep Space Nine' is completely beyond anything that I have ever experienced," the actor once said.</p>
      <p>But he also was known for his portrayal in the 1980s of Clayton Endicott III, the chief of staff to a governor on the long-running sitcom "Benson."</p>
      <p>Other career highlights include his appearance in Robert Altman's 1970 film "MASH" as Father Mulcahy; a role on the quirky TV drama "Boston Legal"; and a host of voice roles in animated fare, including his performance as Chef Louis in Disney's "The Little Mermaid."</p>
      <p>Auberjonois, the son of a writer, grew up in Paris and New York, where his family lived in an artists' colony.</p>
      <p>After university, he broke into showbiz on the stage, and earned a Tony award for his first Broadway musical, "Coco" -- about the life of French fashion designer Coco Chanel -- opposite Katharine Hepburn in the title role.</p>
      <p>'Star Trek' star William Shatner -- who worked with Auberjonois on "Boston Legal" -- led tributes on Twitter, remembering his "wonderful friendship" with the actor, and fellow series regular George Takei called it a "terrible loss."</p>
      <p>"When I look out to the stars, I shall think of you, friend," Takei wrote.</p>
      <p>Auberjonois is survived by his wife Judith and two children, Tessa and Remy-Luc.</p>
