      <p>Cape Town - Interim boss <b>Freddie Ljungberg</b> admits it's a real problem for <b>Arsenal</b> that they are always conceding first and are then required to chase games.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have taken just one point from Ljungberg's two Premier League games at the helm since he was appointed as Unai Emery's temporary successor last month.</p>
      <p>He takes his side to West Ham on Monday night knowing they will be in the bottom half of the table at kick-off following their winless run.</p>
      <p>But the 42-year-old believes he knows where to start correcting the issues to get to back to winning ways.</p>
      <p>"If you score the first goal you don't have to chase the game," he said.</p>
      <p>"You don't have to open up as much because you can control the game so that's something that, in my opinion, we need to change a little bit."</p>
      <p>Ljungberg has spoken about the lack of belief among his players at the moment but insists they will continue working to address the slide.</p>
      <p>"It's never easy when you sack a manager and you're low on confidence," he added.</p>
      <p>"We started really well at Norwich. We started the second half really well and I was sure we were going to win the game and get going again.</p>
      <p>"We get a sucker punch on a counter or as they play down one side. It's hard to take but we keep plugging away."</p>
      <p>Ljungberg will be unable to call on Real Madrid loanee Dani Ceballos, who remains sidelined with a hamstring problem.</p>
      <p>Rob Holding could return following a minor knee injury and will be assessed before the trip to the London Stadium.</p>
