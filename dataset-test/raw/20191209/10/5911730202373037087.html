      <p>Ford is recalling nearly 262,000 heavy-duty pickup trucks in the U.S. and Canada because the tailgates can open unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>The recall covers F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks from the 2017 through 2019 model years. All the trucks have electric tailgate latch release switches in the tailgate handle.</p>
      <p>Ford says water can get into the electrical wiring and cause a short circuit, activating the switches and releasing the latches.</p>
      <p>The company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries.</p>
      <p>Trucks with mechanical tailgate latches are not affected. Dealers will fix the tailgate frame wiring harnesses and install a new tailgate handle release switch.Â </p>
