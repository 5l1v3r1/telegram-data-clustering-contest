        <b>Recently released figures show that health insurance premiums have doubled in the past 20 years, with some Swiss households spending almost one fifth of their salary on healthcare.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Figures from the Swiss Trade Union <a href="https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/sonntagszeitung/familien-geben-jeden-siebten-franken-fuer-praemien-aus/story/21590592">show</a> that costs have increased by 120 percent on average since the year 2000. </p>
      <p>The increases are much higher than wages, while other cost-mitigating changes like rebates for people on lower incomes have also failed to keep up with rising premiums. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Couples with household salaries between 60,000 and 90,000 francs spend on average 14 percent of their salaries on healthcare. </p>
      <p>In some of the more expensive cantons such as Bern and Zurich, the amount can be higher than 20 percent. </p>
      <p>While lower income Swiss will be eligible for reductions and rebates, middle-income Swiss are often hit the hardest by increases in healthcare costs. </p>
      <p>
        <b>More going into debt to pay for healthcare</b>
      </p>
      <p>The impact of the cost increases can be seen in relation to household debt for healthcare. </p>
      <p>At the turn of the millennium, just over a third (36 percent) of households in Switzerland <a href="http://www.dettes.ch/dynasite.cfm?dsmid=78593">had healthcare debts higher than 5000 francs</a>. </p>
      <p>At the present time, 59 percent of households had accrued debts of over 10,000 francs for healthcare costs. </p>
