      <p>Ted Odogwu, Kano</p>
      <p>Kano State governor, Dr  Abdullahi Ganduje, on Monday appointed Emir Mohammed Sanusi, as the pioneer Chairman of the new State Council of Emirs for a period of two years.</p>
      <p>The announcement, which came as a surprise has finally put to rest speculations as to who Governor Ganduje will appoint as the Chairman of the Emirate Council.</p>
      <p>Ganduje had in a recent TV interview said that he would soon appoint a chairman for the State Council of Emirs.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Ganduje, pointed out that the law empowers him to appoint, who becomes the chairman of the State Council of Emirs.</p>
      <p>In a statement by Abba Anwar, his Chief Press Secretary, Ganduje restated that the reason behind the creation of four additional emirates headed by first-class emirs, was that they were in existence in the past.</p>
      <p>He added that it was the people, who yearned for it, so as to facilitate and fast track the socio-economic development of their respective communities.</p>
      <p>”There was a similar demand, during the reign of the late former governor of the old Kano State, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar Rimi, recalling that, at that time, the process for the creation of the then new emirates did not comply, with the provisions of the Constitution.”</p>
