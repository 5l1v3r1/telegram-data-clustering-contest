      <h1>Self-driving Ethiopia PM grants 'crisp interview' ahead of Nobel ceremony</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:56:24+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Abdur Rahman Alfa Shaban</a></address>
      <p>Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will not speak to the press when he arrives in Oslo Norway this week to receive the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize Award.</p>
      <p>But Abiy on Saturday granted an unscheduled interview to a German journalist, Markus Preiss, who was in town with the new head of the European Union Commission.</p>
      <p>The interview was on the streets of Addis Ababa with the Prime Minister seated behind the wheel of a car with a fellow passenger and the journalist posing questions from outside.</p>
      <aside>here is no interview, I'm just saying how are you guys doing?</aside>
      <p>“We were only filming in the streets of Addis – when a car stopped: How I met Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed,” the journalist wrote. The interaction went as follows:</p>
      <p>Markus: You are driving yourself?<br/>Abiy: There is no interview, I’m just saying how are you guys doing?</p>
      <p>Journalist: Good, how did you find the first visit (of the EU delegation) today?<br/>Abiy: Great, amazing, she is a real change maker, we are so happy that she decided to come here first and I hope we will work a very good job with (the) European Union. With the new vibe, with the new leadership we are so happy and grateful.</p>
      <p>Journalist: It’s great to see you.<br/>Abiy: Great to see you too.Enjoy, enjoy your filming.</p>
      <p>Journalist: Good luck in Oslo.<br/>Abiy: After tomorrow, yes, I will be there.</p>
      <p>Journalist: Congratulations.<br/>Abiy: Thank you very much.</p>

      <p>It is not the first time Abiy is filmed driving himself. He has in the past driven guests who came to Ethiopia. A typical case in point was the United Arab Emirates Crown Prince in 2018.</p>
      <p>When the EU Commission chief was also in Addis Ababa, Abiy took the initiative of driving her around town. Earlier this year whiles on a trip to Eritrea, he actually drove his host President Isaias Afwerki around in Asmara.</p>
      <p>On other driving duties, Abiy was behind the wheel of a water tanker late Sunday afternoon watering trees that Ethiopians had planted in a yet-to-be certified world record move earlier this year.</p>
