      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (12:20 P.M.) – A massive U.S. military convoy reportedly arrived in western Iraq this week amid recent attacks carried out near their installations inside the country.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.alsumaria.tv/news/%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86/327685/%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%88%D9%84-500-%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9">Al-Sumaria TV,</a> the U.S. military convoy consisted of 500 vehicles that entered Iraq from neighboring Jordan.</p>
      <p>The U.S. military convoy reportedly reached their final destination at the ‘Ayn Al-Assad Base in Iraq’s Al-Anbar province.</p>
