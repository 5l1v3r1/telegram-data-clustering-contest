      <p>Tagle’s appointment was announced in Rome, Italy on Sunday noon (7 p.m. Manila time), said a Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines News post.</p>
      <p>He will replace Cardinal Fernando Filoni who was appointed as the new Grand Master of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher.</p>
      <p>Tagle’s appointment marks the return of an Asian cardinal to the leadership of the important congregation for evangelization after Indian Cardinal Ivan Dias who served from 2006 to 2011.</p>
      <p>The Vatican News said the Pope “once again shows great attention to the Asian continent.”  The announcement was made near the end of his trip to Thailand and Japan. Tagle will be installed at the Vatican early next year.</p>
      <p>Tagle, 62, was ordained priest for the Diocese of Imus in 1982. Saint John Paul II named him bishop of the diocese in 2001. In October 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Archbishop of Manila, and as cardinal in 2012.</p>
      <p>He has been serving as president of Caritas Internationalis, the Vatican’s social action arm since 2015.</p>
