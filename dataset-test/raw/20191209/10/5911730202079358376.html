      <p>"After what has happened in this nation and in this school district, are we unified? So, we decided to put together this unity walk to unify all of us because at the end of the day we are a district united," says Kayla Bredeson.</p>
      <p>This is the first year Pinellas County Schools will participate in the Unity Walk.</p>
      <p>The Unity Walk will be on January 28, 2020. Their goal will be for 30 students from each school to attend.</p>
      <p>Lynda Blackmon Lowery will be the guest speaker. She's the youngest person who walked across the Edmond Pettis Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. She was 14 years old.</p>
      <p>The Civil Rights Ambassador program is a class at Clearwater High School. The students research and participate in experiences that connect them to the impact of the Civil Rights Movement. They also volunteer in various programs to make a positive impact in the community.</p>
