        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ahh, December. On one hand, it’s a terrible month. It’s cold, it’s dark, it rains all the fucking time — it’s pretty grim when you think about it. But, on the other, it’s glorious.</p>
      <p>There’s a festive cheer in the air, holidays are on the horizon, and people actually seem to want to meet up and have fun. And then you have the indulgences. My god, the indulgences.</p>
      <p>The drink flows. Food’s everywhere. I’m salivating just thinking about it. It’s magnificent.</p>
      <p>But… it can be too easy to go a bit <i>too </i>hard. Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t eat that seventh turkey sandwich of the day, but maybe you could go for a little jog to help burn it off?</p>
      <p>“Sounds good, but how can I motivate myself to do this?” I hear you ask.</p>
      <p>Well, I’ve got a solution for you: a Fibit Versa 2 smartwatch. Oh — and would you believe it? — there’s currently $70 off this device! That means you can pick up <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8824894/type/dlg/https://www.fitbit.com/shop/versa">the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch for only $130</a>, instead of the $200 it normally costs.</p>
      <p>Want some info? Well, first off, why don’t you have a look at this video from Fitbit:</p>

      <p>As you’d expect from a device from Fitbit, the Versa 2 has all the health tracking features you could want. It can measure your heart rate, get real-time readouts on your activities, track your sleep, and more. Hell, you can ever swim with this thing!</p>
      <p>But it’s the range of other features that really makes the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch such a steal for $130. Beyond all its health-tracking capabilities, it’s also a rather handy, uh, smartwatch.</p>
      <p>The display has an always-on mode so you can constantly keep track of the time. You can control music from the device easily, and you can also pay for things with the device.</p>
      <p>Basically, for $130, the Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch is an amazingly advanced bit of kit. Whether you want to use it to get into shape, or give someone you love an awesome Christmas present, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8824894/type/dlg/https://www.fitbit.com/shop/versa">you should pick it up for $130 while you still can</a>.</p>
