      <p>In an unexpected first for the show, Jacqueline Jossa looks set to be the first I'm a Celebrity winner not to take part in live TV interviews following her big win on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>In a major upset to bookies who had runner-up Andy Whyment as the odds on favourite to triumph in the final, Eastenders actress <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/jacqueline-jossa-wins-im-celebrity-17385401">Jacqueline topped the public vote</a> and looked stunned at being announced as winner by Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline's victory, while well received by plenty of people who heralded her a well deserving winner, didn't go down too well with others who thought Andy should have won.</p>
      <p>Some angry fans have even gone as far as saying <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-winner-jacqueline-17385461">the result was fixed.</a></p>
      <p>Once the dust has settled on their jungle win and they've enjoyed a bit of R&amp;R, it is customary for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> champions to take part in a series of live TV interviews, on the likes of GMB and This Morning, but according to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/lm-celeb-winner-jacqueline-jossa-21055373">The Mirror,</a><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-jacqueline-jossa-im-celebrity-17385064">Jacqueline</a> has decided against doing them.</p>
      <p>A source close to Jacqueline has told Mirror Online that she has chosen to spend time with her kids, with her also busy filming for ITV.</p>
      <p>They said: "She has to film for the 'coming out' show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family.</p>
      <p>"Jacqueline and Dan (husband) spent time together in the hotel and probably had a lot to talk about."</p>
      <p>While she was getting stuck into everything jungle life had to throw at her, Jacqueline's TOWIE star husband Dan had to deny cheating claims from model Chloe Ayling, who he appeared in Celebrity Big Brother with in 2018.</p>
