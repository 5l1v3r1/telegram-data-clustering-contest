      <h3>Even if Gazini Ganados, the country’s Miss Universe 2019 bet, did not make it to the top 10, she gave the nation “pride and glory” by winning the Best in National Costume and presenting the unique inspiration from the Philippine Eagle.</h3>
      <p>Malacañang  yesterday lauded her performance in the pageant even if she failed to score a fifth crown for the Philippines.</p>
      <p>However, Ganados made it to the top 20.</p>
      <p>South Africa’s Zozibini Tunzi won the 2019 Miss Universe title.  </p>
      <p>The South African stunner was crowned by last year’s winner, Catriona Gray of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>“The Palace lauds Miss Philippines Gazini Ganados for representing our country well in the Miss Universe pageant in Atlanta, Georgia, USA,” Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said.</p>
      <p>“Ms. Ganados has given pride and glory to the Filipino nation by showcasing the unique beauty and talent of the Filipina.”</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old’s “experience in joining the prestigious beauty pageant should add further to her development as a beauty queen,” Panelo noted.</p>
      <p>“We wish her all the best in her future endeavors,” the Palace official said.</p>
