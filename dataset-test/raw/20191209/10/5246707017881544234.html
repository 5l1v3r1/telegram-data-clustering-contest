      <p>We often describe <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild"><b>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</b></a> as the game that keeps on giving, with new <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/instantly_recharge_your_runes_with_this_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_glitch">tricks</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/zelda_breath_of_the_wilds_latest_glitch_lets_you_transform_a_bookcase_into_a_working_vehicle">glitches</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/06/video_completing_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_in_under_40_minutes_by_flying_on_trees">speedrun revelations</a> and plenty more besides still regularly being found almost three years since the game first launched. Today, we have another one to share with you, and this one's a biggie.</p>
      <p>As you'd expect, the game's final boss, Calamity Ganon, isn't usually the easiest of foes to take down. With one very precisely timed pull on your bow, however, that can all change.</p>
      <p>The video below shows the trick in action; essentially, shooting an Ancient Arrow just before Ganon's cutscene begins will finish him off the moment the battle begins. Check it out (the arrow is fired at the very beginning, and Ganon suddenly falls to his doom as soon as the fight starts at around 3:20):</p>

      <p>So why on Earth does that happen? Well, according to the video's creator, <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/news/a-game-changing-new-breath-of-the-wild-glitch-one-shots-ganon-any-boss-in-the-game/">Gaming Reinvented</a>, it would appear that bosses can take damage during cutscenes. We imagine this was completely unintentional on Nintendo's part, but characters - including Link - seem to take continuous damage during cutscenes. So that single arrow was slowly but surely taking away Ganon's health the whole time.</p>
      <p>Here's another example, this time against Windblight Ganon. Notice how he just explodes the moment the fight begins.</p>
