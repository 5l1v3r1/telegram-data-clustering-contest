      </p>
      <p>The former senator representing Kogi West at the National Assembly, Dino Melaye, has won the ‘Man of the Year’ award just days after losing a return to the legislative chamber.</p>
      <p>However, a mild <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1219307-4-types-drama-literature.html">drama</a> ensued when the organisers of the award called Garba Shehu, a spokesperson of President Muhammadu Buhari, to present the award to the former senator.</p>
      <p>The mention of Garba resulted in guests clapping and hailing in surprise.</p>
      <p>Even Melaye, who was standing while his citation was read out, could not hold his laughter as well.</p>

      <p>The drama continued as Garba came out, stood before Melaye, paused for a moment before speaking. This action further caused laughter in the audience.</p>

      <p>Garba then asked jokingly after collecting the plaque to be presented to Melaye: <i>“Should I just take this thing and leave him standing here?”</i></p>
      <p>He told the guests that he had been close to Dino Melaye being that the duo had come a very long way. He added that they had worked together on many projects. He noted that politics has a way of bringing people together and also dividing them.</p>
      <p>In his reaction after receiving the award, Melaye described Garba as his brother and friend. He confirmed that the two of them have a longstanding relationship beyond the current dispensation.</p>
      <p><i>“And I appreciate him for presenting this award. I appreciate the organisers,”</i> Melaye said.</p>
      <p>He was described as the most performed and vibrant member of the National Assembly. Melaye had also won senator of the year in 2017.</p>
