      <h3>HOW DOES DIABETES AFFECT IMMUNITY?</h3>
      <p>When your your blood sugar levels go for a toss, every cell of your body gets severely damaged. In fact, diabetes can affect your crucial organs too. These damages drive your body into an immune response mode leading to inflammation. Prolonged inflammation leads to various kinds of diseases including obesity.</p>
      <p>In case of excessive cell and tissue damage in your body, the immune cells are likely to go on an overdrive mode. Under normal circumstances, the macrophages (white blood cells which are part of your immune system) clear the cellular debris to battle any kind of tissue damage. They also wipe out foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, and everything else that aren’t healthy to body cells. When there is too much damage happening and that too for a prolonged period of time, the macrophages go on an overdrive and kill the healthy cells leading to inflammation. That is why you need to keep your blood sugar levels in check, if you need a healthy immune system.</p>
      <h3>BOOST YOUR IMMUNITY NATURALLY</h3>

It also increases the activity of immune cells called macrophages. These cells play a role in triggering non-specific immune responses and further reduce chances of infections. Apart from this, Dabur Chawanprakash comes with a plethora of other health benefits: Boosting your respiratory and brain functions functions, revving up your heart health and helping you look younger.</p>
