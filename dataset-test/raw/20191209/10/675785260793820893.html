      <p>A British man has been arrested after he allegedly went on a near two-mile wrecking spree with a stolen coach in Benidorm.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage shows the coach smashing into mopeds and cars parked by the side of the road.</p>
      <p>A police car was also damaged during the drama, which happened around 3.30am on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>The coach was driven at speed through the Spanish holiday resort after being taken from a depot where it had been left for the night.</p>
      <p>The suspect is alleged to have accessed a room where the key was kept.</p>

      <p>Police sources confirmed the suspect is a British national.</p>
      <p>One local said: “It was lucky there were few people around at that time of the night otherwise things could have turned out a lot worse.</p>
      <p>“A lot of cars and motorbikes have been damaged but no-one fortunately has been hurt that I know of.”</p>

      <p>The coach was taken from a car park near a sports centre known locally as the Palau d’Esports l’Illa on the outskirts of Benidorm.</p>
      <p>It was driven towards the town centre and into a neighbourhood known as Els Tolls, even passing by the local police HQ at one point before being stopped in a road.</p>
      <p>The exact number of vehicles damaged has yet to be disclosed.</p>
      <p>The suspect has been handed over to the National Police force and is expected to appear in court later on Monday or Tuesday on suspicion of stealing a vehicle and road traffic offences.</p>
      <p>He would have been breathalysed and made to take a drugs test, but the results of the tests have not been made public yet.</p>
