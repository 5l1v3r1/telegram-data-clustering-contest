        <b>Cardi B hit the clubs in Ghana with T.I. this weekend, just as she was forced to hit back at claims she ‘snubbed’ a meet-and-greet to lounge by the pool eating a kebab.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The I Like It rapper flew out to Nigeria last week to begin her tour of West Africa before making the short trip over to Ghana for more events.</p>
      <p>After touching down on her private jet, Cardi received a warm welcome at the airport in Accra where a large horde of fans and photographers were waiting to catch a glimpse of the rap superstar.</p>
      <p>Cardi, 27, then settled into her luxurious hotel suite, which included a large bathroom with his and her sinks and a standalone bathtub, large corridors, several rooms and a stunning view with the ocean in the distance.</p>
      <p>Hours later, Cardi then hit the club for her scheduled appearance at Livespot x Festival where T.I. and his wife Tiny just happened to be.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram video, Cardi is seen dancing the VIP section as T.I. sips his drink while cuddling Tiny.</p>
      <p>‘@tip and @tiny makin some big money moves out here!’ Cardi captioned the clip.</p>

      <p>It came after Cardi was forced to defend herself after it was claimed she had snubbed a meet-and-greet earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>The Bodak Yellow rapper shared an Instagram story of herself sitting by the hotel pool and eating a kebab, which is called Chinchinga in Ghana, at the same time the meet-and-greet was taking place.</p>
      <p>However, Cardi argues she wasn’t aware the event was in her contract and she wasn’t told about it.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram video, the Grammy-winning rapper explained: ‘First things first, I asked my booking agent “do I have a meet and greet today?” So a meet-and-greet wasn’t in my contract, right? I didn’t know I had a motherf****n meet and greet today. I know I had one in Nigeria, I was on time for that, I did all of that.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t know I had one today. When I woke up, I went downstairs at around 3pm to soak up some sun in the pool and my stomach started hurting, that was around 3pm, right? [sic].’</p>

      <p>Cardi continued: ‘Then I woke up, I see this rage going on on f*****g social media, and everybody’s like yeah you gotta do a meet and greet.</p>
      <p>‘I seen there was a lot of my fans there at the meet and greet, so I thought you know what, I don’t give a f**k if it’s not in my contract, I’m going downstairs [sic].’</p>
      <p>Many Ghanianian celebrities were also at the meet-and-greet after being invited to meet the Money rapper, and slammed Cardi on social media believing she had snubbed them.</p>
      <p>Reacting to their anger, Cardi said: ‘Then I guess a lot of artists were upset because they got invited to the meet and greet and I wasn’t there. For that I apologise but then again that wasn’t my fault because it wasn’t me who did that.</p>
      <p>‘Let me tell you what I don’t f*****g like, I saw a bunch of females, they supposed to be artists from here and I didn’t know that [sic].’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘But when I was around the pool at around 3pm, which is the time when the meet and greet was supposed to be going on, I was in the pool and the same girls talking s**t about me, saying I’m this or I’m that, y’all saw me… so if you see me around the pool and I’m chilling, staring at me as if I have a piece of f*****g s**t on my eyes, why don’t you come up to me and say, “Welcome to Ghana”? [sic]’</p>
      <p>After flying out of Ghana, Cardi wrote in another Instagram post: ‘I was in Ghana for less than 24 hours. Went thru a lil dilemma but I still had fun [sic].’</p>
