      <p>Musicians are known for their contributions to the music industry and one would think with the release of Forbes world top earning musicians of 2019, their wealth would stem only from their music.</p>
      <p>However, most of these top earning musicians have capitalised on their fame, success in the industry and their esteemed brands to venture into other businesses.</p>
      <p>Forbes considers all other streams of income tied to the artiste to curate the list and mostly looks at earnings before tax and payments to lawyers, managers or agents.</p>
      <p>“To determine our rankings, we consider <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/angolan-isabela-dos-santos-african-forbes-100-powerful-women">income</a> from touring, music and outside business ventures with the help of Pollstar, Nielsen Music and interviews with industry insiders including many of the stars themselves,” Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/12/06/the-worlds-top-earning-musicians-of-2019/#aa51378164e7">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The top 10 highest paid musicians in the world this year earned a little over $1 billion as compared to $886 million from last year. The figures, according to Forbes, were calculated from June 2018 to June 2019.</p>
      <p>This remarkable feat goes a long way in revealing how some of the most popular and most sought-after musicians are cashing in on the industry.</p>
      <p>Here’s a list of the <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/here-are-the-top-5-highest-paid-hip-hop-acts-for-2019">top five</a> African American musicians who made it to the top 10.</p>
