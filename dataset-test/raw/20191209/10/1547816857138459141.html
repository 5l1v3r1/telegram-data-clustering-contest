        <b>SpotboyE.com has been bringing to you all the goss from inside the STAR Screen Awards 2019, which unfolded last night. Here's another one about Urvashi Rautela and Taapsee Pannu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Actresses and their cat fights form an integral part of Bollywood. While not even one openly accept that they have issues and usually give the "we're friends" tag, yet updates about things going sour between them don't stop coming. </p>
      <p>You may recall, a few days back, reports said that Taapsee Pannu feels Urvashi Rautela needs a new stylist. The comment made a lot of headlines and Urvashi's fans also got upset with Taapsee's statement, mocking the Paagalpani actress' fashion mantra. </p>
      <p>However, last night, something absolutely interesting happened at the STAR Screen Awards 2019. Who would have thought that the ladies will end up sitting next to each other at the function? We bring to you an EXCLUSIVE picture of the same.</p>

      <p>That's right. When Urvashi walked in at the awards show, she was told that her seat is next to Taapsee's. Now, she did not make a fuss about it and quietly accepted to sit besides Taapsee, in spite of latter's comment on her styling. We don't know what the Pink actress was feeling about it though. </p>
      <p>Now, after seeing what Urvashi was wearing yesterday at the awards nite, we really hope Taapsee gave the same suggestion to her face to face.  </p>
