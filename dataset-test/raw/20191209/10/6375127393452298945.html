      <h3>AN ALERT Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) guard foiled an attempt to smuggle contraband inside Navotas City Jail (NCJ) by passing through steel grills of the extension facility yesterday before dawn in Navotas City.</h3>
      <p>Jail Warden Chief Insp. Ricky Heart Pegalan said SJ01 Virgilio Obispo was conducting a routine inspection at around 1 a.m. outside the premises of the city jail when he noticed a man trying to sneak in a red plastic bag inside the two-story facility which served as jail extension.</p>
      <p>The unidentified man immediately ran away, leaving the red plastic bag hanging from the steel grills of the extension facility, prompting Obispo to grab the bag and bring it to the duty desk officer.</p>
      <p>When jail duty officer Insp. Mark Jerome Cagurungan checked the contents of the bag, it yielded 11 rims of Mighty cigarettes, two packs of Marlboro red, two mobile phones, two head set and cellular phone charger wrapped in brown packaging tape.</p>
      <p>Pegalan, a lawyer, said those who wanted to sneak contraband inside the jail facility will be facing jail time if they will be caught red handed.</p>
      <p>He added that they will continue to adhere to the directives and policies issued by Regional Director of the Jail Bureau Jail Chief Supt. Ignacio Panti to fulfill its objective of zero contraband inside jail facility through intensified roving inspection and installation of preventive measures.</p>
