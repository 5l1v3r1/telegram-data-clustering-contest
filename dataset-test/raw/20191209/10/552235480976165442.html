      <h1>Why Russia's doping ban doesn't spell good news for Scotland's Euro 2020 hopes</h1>
      <h2>Some Scotland fans may have hoped that it could guarantee them a trip to the Euros but we've got some bad news.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:50:35+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:50</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Russia have been banned from major sporting events for four years but it won't have an effect on their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> qualification.</p>
      <p>They won't be allowed to compete at the Qatar <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/world-cup-2022">World Cup</a> in 2022 or the Tokyo Olympics next year.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> fans who may have hoped that their doping could give the Tartan Army automatic qualification for the Euro 2020 will be left disappointed.</p>
      <p>Russia will still be allowed to compete at the tournament next summer with Saint Petersburg also still allowed to host games.</p>
      <p>The city has games in the group and quarter final but WADA's ban means Russia aren't allowed to host major sporting events either.</p>
      <p>However, UEFA's isn't viewed as a 'Major Sporting Organisation' by the International Standard for Code Compliance by Signatories.</p>

      <p>The ISCCS lay out the rules on doping breaches and their definition of a Major Sporting Organisation is "continental association of National Olympic Committees and other international multisport organisations that function as a ruling body for any continental, regional or other international event."</p>
      <p>That means that because <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/uefa">UEFA</a> are a governing body for a single sport rather than multiple, Euro 2020 isn't covered.</p>
      <p>The code does cover single sport world championships and that is why they will be banned from the 2022 World Cup - hosted by FIFA rather than UEFA.</p>
      <p>UEFA have said they won't be making any contact at this stage following the announcement.</p>
      <p>The 2021 Champions League Final is also due to be held in the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg.</p>
      <p>Russia finished in second place in Scotland's group for Euro 2020 qualifying with two victories over Steve Clarke's men.</p>
