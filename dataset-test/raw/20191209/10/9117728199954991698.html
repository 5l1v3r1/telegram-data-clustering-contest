        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly's</a> 2019 was certainly a roller coaster as he faced promotion, demotion and a podium all in one season. The Frenchman has admitted he felt as if he had nine races to prove himself after returning to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gasly started the season with Red Bull but the tone for his year was set at Albert Park as he missed out on the points on his debut. It gradually improved but during the summer break <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> took the decision to drop Gasly to Toro Rosso, and replace him with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> and that is how it will stay next season.</p>
      <p>However, Gasly showed some signs of a resurgence at Toro Rosso, especially when he finished second in Brazil, ensuing jubilant scenes after the race. The Frenchman has admitted he was shocked and angry after receiving the news of his demotion.</p>
