      <h3>MAYOR Isko Moreno yesterday said he would want Manila to lead in helping the government of President Rodrigo Duterte toward the direction of putting an end to the practice of short-term employment called ‘endo’.</h3>
      <p>In his speech at yesterday’s regular flag-raising ceremony in City Hall, Moreno said he would want to make Manila ‘the number one implementor with regard the government campaign to finish ‘endo.’</p>
      <p>The mayor said he has already promoted about 500 employees since he assumed mayorship on June 30, adding that it had been the city govenment’s policy to give priority to JOs or ‘job order personnel’ so they can become permanent employees.</p>
      <p>‘Pag pinipirmahan ko appointment, di ako nagkakaroon ng kwentada sa kaisipan.  Sa loob ng limang buwan, naging polisiya ko nang bigyang prayoridad ang mga JO na maging permanent.  Halos inaabot ako ng madaling araw sa pagpirma,’ Moreno said.</p>
      <p>Stressing he wants to provide certainty and security in the minds of JO personnel, Moreno cited a case where the JO was found to have been serving for 27 years already.</p>
      <p>‘Ibig sabihin, 54 times na siyang nagpapapirma ng  papel. Ganun din, 54 times na siyang nangamba. Imagine that kind of life, that kind of emotion,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Moreno assured the city employees that he will be fair in the manner of promotion, citing length of service and  if the applicant is qualified as the top considerations.</p>
      <p>JOs are similarly-situated with contractual employes in private companies in that their employment is good for only six months subject to renewal if their services are still needed. ‘Endo’ refers to end of contract.</p>
