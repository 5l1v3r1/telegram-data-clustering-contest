      <h1>Rival manager heaps praise on Bristol Rovers after Southend United comeback</h1>
      <h2>Four second half goals secured all three points against Sol Campbell's Shrimpers after the Gas struggled in the first half</h2>

      <p>Wycombe Wanderers boss Gareth Ainsworth has heaped praise on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers</a> after their comeback against Southend this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Gas were 2-0 down at half time on Saturday, but second half goals from Jonson Clarke-Harris, Abu Ogogo, Ed Upson and Alfie Kilgour secured the three points.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-verdict-gas-show-3620265">Graham Coughlan's side</a> have only lost once at the Mem so far this season, and it is this home form which Ainsworth pointed out for praise.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.dplay.co.uk/show/efl-on-quest">EFL on Quest</a> highlights show, the Chairboys boss said: "It's a tough place to go, a really tough place to go.</p>
      <p>"They are making the most of teams going there and struggling.</p>

      <p>"With Southend going 2-0 up, they (the Gas) must have thought that they always have a chance.</p>
      <p>"With Clarke-Harris on form as always, it was a great result for them."</p>
      <p>Wycombe laboured to a 0-0 draw against Rovers when they visited the Mem in August, with the only loss at home coming against Bolton in October.</p>
      <p>Rovers have won five and drawn three of their other 8 games at home, and will look to continue that home form as they aim to stay in the play off spots.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-southend-graham-coughlan-3620556">Rovers now find themselves in fifth place, and after the game Gas boss Graham Coughlan</a> issued a challenge to his players to stay in the top six.</p>
      <p>He said: "Staying there is the challenge.</p>
      <p>"Staying in and around that area is a mighty, mighty challenge and I even asked the players if they’ve got it within them to meet that challenge, I would say to them if you turn up like that too often (like they did in the first half) you’ll get punished, you won’t be able to do that too often.</p>
      <p>"We have been here before, we were fourth in the division and didn’t maintain it, we’re fifth in the division tonight, my challenge to the lads is to maintain that."</p>
