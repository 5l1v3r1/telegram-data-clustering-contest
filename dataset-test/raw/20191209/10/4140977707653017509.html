          <p>Barcelona’s star midfielder is set to miss Barcelona matches for few weeks after he has reportedly encountered an STD infection, and its treatment will keep him away from matches as its dosages can violate anti-doping norms.</p>
          <p>According to Andreu Ginola, the reason Arthur Melo did not play against Mallorca was because of a sexually transmitted infection. The club claimed he missed out due to a groin injury, whereas Ginola claims it was due to gonorrhoea.</p>

                      <p>Therefore, the Brazilian International will be ruled out for the next few games, including the much-hyped first El Clasico of the 2019/20 season. Which brings Ivan Rakitic and Carles Alena up in the pecking order.</p>
                      <p>Arthur’s position in Barcelona’s midfield was on the verge being cemented as he was able to form a decisive partnership with Frenkie De Jong but this alleged situation marks a halt in the partnership.</p>

                          <p>As for now, the club has not released any statement regarding this report about Arthur but it remains to be seen what would be the future conduct of the club.</p>

                            <p>Barcelona is currently at the top of the table with an equal number of points to Real Madrid in La Liga. The coming clash between the fierce rivals can possibly bring the difference in the table unless either of the teams loses points in this coming game-week.</p>
