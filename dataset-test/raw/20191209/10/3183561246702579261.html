      <p>While terms like '3310' and 'Snake' come to mind when Nokia is mentioned, that may be about to change.</p>
      <p>The smart phone company is getting into the smart TV game. Well, it's letting its name be slapped on one at the very least.</p>
      <p>Indian company Flipkart has secured a licensing deal with Nokia for its new 55-inch smart TV.</p>
      <p>It will have a 4K UHD screen with a 60Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of max brightness, Dolby vision and HDR10 support, two 24-watt JBL by Harman speakers, 16GB on-board storage, a quad-core processor, three HDMI ports, two USB-ports, Wi-Fi and bluetooth connectivity.</p>
      <p>It will also run an Android 9 operating system with access to Google Play.</p>
      <p>"The first-ever Nokia branded Smart TV with Sound by JBL is powered by 24 Watt built-in speakers, DTS TruSurround and Dolby Audio to enhance the overall audio experience at home," Flipkart said in a statement. "This feature addresses a major pain point among Indian consumers, many of whom except a better sound quality from their televisions today."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tv/news/nokia-smart-tv-price-in-india-rs-41999-launch-flipkart-jbl-specifications-features-2143765">Gadgets 360</a>, Flipkart has stated that its looking to sell more Nokia-branded TVs in the future, though there are no details as yet. We are also unsure if we will ever see them in Australia, though it seems unlikely.</p>
      <p>The Nokia 55 Inch Ultra HD TV (4K) will launch in India on December 10 and will have an RRP of 41,999 Indian rupees, which is about $862.</p>
