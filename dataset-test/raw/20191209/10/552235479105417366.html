      <p>Parker’s mum Shannen felt her little boy was too young to appreciate getting an elf on the shelf, so gave him the role of the elf in their house.</p>
      <p>She said: “I loved doing Elf on the Shelf so much when I was a nursery teacher and knew Parker was too little to understand it.</p>
      <p>“So I decided to make him the elf and just have fun doing naughty things every morning!”</p>

      <p>Mischievous little Parker has been a busy elf. So far he has managed to cover his dad David’s face with lipstick, mess up the kitchen with chocolate and cereal, put balls down the toilet and unwrap toilet paper all over the floor!</p>
      <p>And Shannen is sure there is lots more to come in December, as Parker loves being an Elf so much he is refusing to take his outfit off.</p>
      <p>She added: “He loves it and is getting away with being naughty and likes us telling him how he cute he is as an elf.”</p>
