      <p>Speaking about her bond with her father, Sonakshi said in an old Rediff interview, "I have always been the apple of my father's eye. I am the most pampered person at home since I am the youngest. Also, because I am a girl. He is the best father that I could have asked for."</p>
      <p>In yet another interview, when asked if she discusses work with him, the actress had said, '"I discuss some of my films with him, as and when we get the time. He doesn't really interfere in what roles or movies I choose. He watches my films as a father and is my biggest fan."</p>
      <p>Last year, Sonakshi and Shatrughan Sinha shared a frame in Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se song 'Rafta Rafta'.</p>
      <p>Talking about films, Sonakshi will next be seen in Salman Khan's 'Dabangg 3'. Explaining why 'Dabangg' is a special franchise for her, the actress told IANS, "Every time I enter the set of Dabangg, it is a special feeling. I started my journey 10 years ago with that film. It was my debut film opposite Salman Khan. My equation will never change with him no matter how many films I sign and what I achieve as an actress. He helped me to find my calling; I did not even know that I can act and I am an actress now."</p>
      <p>Besides this movie, Sonakshi is also a part of Ajay Devgn's 'Bhuj: The Pride Of India' alongside Parineeti Chopra, Sanjay Dutt, Rana Daggubati and Ammy Virk.</p>
