      <p>Mumbai: Around 10 senior employees of Asian securities firm <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/CLSA">CLSA</a>’s India unit are likely to join rival <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jefferies">Jefferies</a>, ET NOW reported on Monday citing sources.</p>
      <p>These include employees from research as well as sales division, report said.</p>
      <p>CLSA analysts <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahesh-Nandurkar">Mahesh Nandurkar</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashish-Agrawal">Ashish Agrawal</a> are among those employees who are making the switch.</p>
      <p>Emails sent to CLSA and Jefferies seeking a confirmation were not yet replied to.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Christopher-Wood">Christopher Wood</a> was appointed as global head of equity Strategy at Jefferies in May. Wood, one of the top-ranked market strategists, joined Jefferies from CLSA, where he spent around two decades.</p>
      <p>Wood’s exit from CLSA earlier this year was the latest in a string of high-level resignations at the rocked Hong Kong-based securities firm in recent times.</p>
