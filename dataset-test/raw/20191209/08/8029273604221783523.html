      <p>Hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the forum will look at emerging trends in smart transport systems, Seoul’s smart transport policies and the municipality’s support for private companies looking to break into the overseas transport industry. It will also discuss strategies for exporting smart transport technologies and expertise.</p>
      <p>Officials from the municipality, the Korea Transport Institute, ITS Korea and sTraffic will attend the forum, which runs from 2 to 4:30 p.m. at the Seoul Global Center’s international conference hall.</p>
      <p>As the rapid pace of urbanization continues to present problems such as pollution and increased waste, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has strived to turn the country’s capital into a smart city by incorporating technologies -- such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, big data and 5G communications -- that enhance the quality of its services as well as citizens’ lives.</p>
      <p>In March, the municipality unveiled a plan to invest 1.4 trillion won ($1.18 billion) to make Seoul smarter.</p>
      <p>In the transport sector, some 50,000 IoT sensors will be installed to alleviate chronic parking problems. Once they are in place, it will be possible to check the availability of parking spaces in real time with a mobile phone application.</p>
      <p>AI taxis are also expected to be launched. Under the new system, demand for taxis could be predicted in real time through analysis of pick-up and drop-off times, as well as information on weather, demographics, commercial areas and public transportation. Taxi drivers would be able to check their meter screens and directly see nearby locations with many potential passengers waiting.</p>
      <p>The city has exported smart transport infrastructure -- for example, a big data-based bus service system and a comprehensive transport control tower -- to countries including Ukraine, Tanzania and Ecuador as part of the city’s efforts to help developing countries address urban problems.</p>
      <p>The municipality has also invited officials from foreign governments to give them a glimpse of Seoul’s smart transport models. It has held international forums and provided policy advice in partnership with various international organizations, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
