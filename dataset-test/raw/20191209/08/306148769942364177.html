      <p>The city of Pensacola, Florida, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/pensacola-cyber-attack/index.html">has been dealing with a cyberattack since late Friday</a> when a Saudi Air Force trainee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/us/pensacola-gunman.html">killed three sailors at Pensacola Naval Air Station</a>. Officials for the city are unsure whether the incidents are related. CNN reports: <i>The city of Pensacola, Florida, said it has experienced a cyber "incident" and has disconnected several city services until the issue can be resolved. Mayor Grover Robinson told CNN affiliate WEAR the city has been dealing with a cyberattack since late Friday. The city said the issue has impacted city emails and phones, 311 customer service and online payments, including Pensacola Energy and Pensacola Sanitation Services. However, 911 and emergency services are not impacted. </i>As for whether the cyberattack is related to the Friday shooting, Kaycee Lagarde, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said: "It's really too early to say one way or another. We are still assessing this. We understand that it's on people's mind but we just don't know at this point." <br/><br/>Lagarde said the incident was reported to the FBI and Homeland Security as a precaution.</p>
