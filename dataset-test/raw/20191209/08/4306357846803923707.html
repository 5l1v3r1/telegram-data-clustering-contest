      <h3>Roy Keane has aimed a dig at Tottenham Hotspur after Manchester United’s 2-1 victory over Manchester City in the derby at The Etihad on Saturday.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils secured a vital three points in the top-four race after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side managed to record successive Premier League victories for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford broke the deadlock from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute before France striker Anthony Martial doubled the away side’s lead six minutes later.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have collected six points from their last two Premier League outings after the Red Devils edged to a 2-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur last week.</p>
      <p>The 20-time English champions have hoisted themselves into fifth position in the Premier League table and five points adrift of Chelsea FC in the top-four race.</p>
      <p>While Keane was impressed with Manchester United’s “proper” performance at Manchester City, the <i>Sky Sports</i> pundit played down the significance of their victory over Spurs last week.</p>
      <p>“I said before the show, I didn’t think beating Tottenham at home was a big deal for Manchester United. Spurs, we know their mentality,” Keane told <i>Sky Sports</i> after the derby win.</p>
      <p>“But beating Man City will only given the players confidence. They’ve been criticised a lot recently and today we need to take our hats off.</p>
      <p>“They were outstanding. It was a Manchester United performance. The way they managed the game, the blocks, the speed, it was brilliant. For me that’s what Manchester United is all about.</p>
      <p>“But they have to do it consistently and they do need a helping hand and hopefully they get that in the next couple of transfer windows.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United will be looking to record a third successive Premier League win when the Red Devils host a resurgent Everton side at Old Trafford next Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Blues were 3-1 winners against Chelsea FC at Goodison Park after Duncan Ferguson took over the reins of the Merseyside club from Marco Silva.</p>
