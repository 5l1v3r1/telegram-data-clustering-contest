      <p>PARIS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Consultancy Strategie Grains forecast that rapeseed production in the European Union would reach 18.46 million tonnes next year, rebounding from a 13-year low of 16.85 million this year.</p>
      <p>The 2020 crop forecast would still be one of the smallest in recent years after a drought-disrupted sowing campaign in western Europe. It was in line with Strategie Grains' initial outlook last month which said next year's output might not reach the 19-million-tonne level.</p>
      <p>The production forecast for next year was based on an expected crop area of 5.68 million hectares, up from 5.53 million tonnes in 2019, and a projected yield of 3.25 tonnes per hectare, up from 3.05 tonnes per hectare estimated for this year's harvest.</p>
