        <li>The Barça president spoke to Italian newspaper 'La Repubblica'</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Josep Maria Bartomeu spoke to Italian outlet 'La Repubblica' ahead of Tuesday's Champions League game against Inter at the San Siro. </p>
      <p>In the interview, the Barcelona president was asked about Pep Guardiola possibly returning to Camp Nou in the future. The Manchester City coach left the club in 2012. </p>
      <p>"It doesn't depend on me," Bartomeu said after Pep's dad, Valenti, suggested it was a possibility last week. "It was Pep who decided to leave, but the door will always be open for him at Barça."  </p>
      <p>Bartomeu also spoke a range of other subjects, including: </p>
      <p><b>Lionel Messi:</b> "Before my mandate's over, I would like to give him a lifetime contract as we did with Andres Iniesta. He's earned the right to decide when to say that's enough. The only hope that Italians, Brits and fans from other countries have of seeing him up close is to wait until Barça visit. As a footballer, Messi is the No.1 and we will fully understand that in the years to come because Leo's not just changed Barça's history, he's changed football's history." </p>
      <p><b>Rakitic and Vidal:</b> "We don't expect much movement (in January). We have a balanced team, we don't need anything, but we can't afford to lose anyone either." </p>
      <p><b>Lautaro Martinez:</b> "That's a trick question. The only thing I can say is that Inter are playing really well and he's not the only one who's impressed me. it's no coincidence they're top of Serie A." </p>
