      <p>STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Swedish government and the centre-right parties backing it in parliament said on Monday they would postpone labor reforms, potentially defusing a row that had threatened the policy deal that keeps Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in power.</p>
      <p>The governing Social Democrats and Greens, along with the centre-right Liberal and Centre parties that support it, said the reform of the country’s unemployment agency would be postponed by one year and would be based on a different legal framework.</p>
      <p>The move is in line with demands made by the opposition Moderates and Christian Democrats who had threatened to join forces with the Sweden Democrats and Left Party in a vote of no confidence in Labour Market Minister Eva Nordmark.</p>
      <p>The ultimatum, which had some leading Social Democrats raising the risk of the government resigning, was awkward for Lofven as it hit at a reform agreed by him and his centre-right supporters in what is called the January Agreement that ended months of deadlock in forming a government after inconclusive 2018 elections.</p>
      <p>“The January agreement stands firm,” Lofven and leaders of the Greens, Liberals and Centre wrote in a signed article in Swedish daily Aftonbladet.</p>
      <p>“The reform of the unemployment agency is a big and important reform that requires the support of parliament. In order to make that possible, we have agreed to the changes we are now presenting,” they added.</p>
