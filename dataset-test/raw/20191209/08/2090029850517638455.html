      <p>She arrived in the Ghanaian capital early on Sunday and was greeted by hoards of people at the city’s airport, including local press.</p>
      <p>The Bodack Yellow songstress then treated fans to a tour of her humongous hotel room.</p>
      <blockquote>‘Oh snap, we are going to turn up today. I want to bring the baddest b****** to my room, this room is far too big not to have a party,’ she exclaimed while walking around the plush room with a hotel rep and her entourage.</blockquote>
      <p>Early that morning she had been raunchily dancing in Lagos alongside Burna Boy before hopping on a private jet for her flight to Ghana.</p>
      <p>Man, we in motherf***in Nigeria!’ the Bronx-born Latina – who boasts 74.7M followers – said of her new surroundings when she landed there on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The musician is in Africa because she was headlining the LiveSpot X Festival’s stops in Lagos on Saturday and Accra on Sunday.</p>
