      <p>One mum said conditions were “disgusting” and told how she saw “mice poo” droppings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/its-disgusting-mice-invasion-childrens-softplay-area-edinburghs-commonwealth-pool-1335054">Speaking to Edinburgh Evening News</a>, she said: “I was in the climbing frame with my son playing and noticed little droppings of mice poo in the corner, it was disgusting.</p>
      <p>"I just picked him up and went straight to the staff.</p>
      <p>"They did not seem shocked, the response I got was that the softplay area is getting deep cleaning every evening and that there was nothing to worry about.</p>
      <p>“But I was in the cafe the next day and there was this furry grey colour thing that moved super-fast. At first I did think it was fluff until it moved.</p>
      <p>"I screamed a little and another customer noticed it too. My kids both screamed and tried to chase it.</p>
      <p>“The woman who noticed it in the cafe did say this isn’t the first time she has spotted a mouse, she actually said she was in a fitness class and one ran out of a cupboard."</p>
      <p>And the mum said she will not return to the Edinburgh kids venue until it has been given a “deep clean” to get rid of the vermin.</p>
      <p>She said: “After the fourth time of seeing poo and mice running around the centre I refuse to return until the place has closed for a deep clean.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure the staff or manager care after speaking to them on a number of occasions and it seems very little has been done.</p>
      <p>"It’s disgusting to think of my kids playing in a soft play that has mice poo in it. Kids nowadays put anything in their mouth, I would hate to think of a kids eating this and becoming seriously ill."</p>
      <p>It is believed the rodents have migrated to the pool building from nearby Holyrood Park amid cold weather conditions.</p>
      <p>An Edinburgh Leisure spokesperson said: "We’re sorry to any customers who have been affected or upset. The cleanliness of our facilities is of the utmost importance and we have taken a number of actions to alleviate the issue.</p>
      <p>"The soft-play is cleaned daily and on Tuesday last week it was closed in the morning to undergo a deep clean, with a further 3-hour clean on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Pest control are also supporting us in eradicating the problem. Since the incident was reported, the frame is being checked daily and there is no further evidence and no further complaints have been received. We do not have an infestation."</p>
