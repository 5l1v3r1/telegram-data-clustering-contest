      <p>The game’s lastest update adds Snoop alongside James Cybulski, offering up play-by-play of all the action.</p>
      <p>“Ice hockey really be lit now with me in the booth,” Snoop said of his inclusion over <a href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1203096434930671616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>The Doggfather is also available as a playable character inside the game’s World of Chel online multiplayer and as a featured HUT squad; in both, he sports a custom jersey with his name and hometown zip code. You can check that out above.</p>
