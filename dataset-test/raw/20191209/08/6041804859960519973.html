      <p>It is a bonanza of teasers and trailers for the Telugu cinema lovers as the holiday season is on and everybody is in some mood to get to watch really good entertainers and there three the films created their slots for the seasonal watch in audience expectations but one of them totally overpowered the other two with just a teaser according to social media buzz.</p>
      <p>The teaser is of mass maharaja Ravi Teja’s <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/disco-raja-teaser-talk-ravi-teja-has-done-with-the-crap/">Disco Raja</a> which is up for a release after the big bang of Sankranthi race. Well, the other two which couldn’t beat Disco Raja teaser are Venky Mama and Prati Roju Pandage trailers. All the three got good points in showing what to expect for their releases but Disco Raja trailer looked better for the way they could grab attention every second with mass entertaining bits on every track of the teaser.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/venky-mama-trailer-talk-a-formulaic-yet-colourful-commercial-blast/">Prati Roju Pandage</a> and <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/venky-mama-trailer-talk-a-formulaic-yet-colourful-commercial-blast/">Venky Mama</a> couldn’t beat that hype are what netizens think after watching all the three. While Venky’s and Sai Dharam’s are coming this month with a week gap, Ravi Teja’s is coming with mere competition at the end of January. Looks like the odds are on Ravi Teja’s side who is in a very poor form with back to back duds and is waiting for a proper outing. Will Mass Maharaja bounce back this time with Disco Raja? Let’s see.</p>
