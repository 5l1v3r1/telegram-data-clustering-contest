      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:35:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/derekhealey/" target="_blank">Derek Healey</a></address>
      <p>Dundee jeweller Lorraine Law and Marie Curie patron Petra McMillan are inviting readers to donate just £5 for the chance to win one of four final pieces worth over £1,200.</p>
      <p>One of the items – a handmade 9ct gold and diamond heart pendant worth £500 – was forged from a fraction of the many hundreds of donations sent in from Inverness to the Borders in the Marie Curie Magpie Appeal launched in The Courier last spring.</p>
      <p>Ms McMillan and Ms Law feel it is important those who have supported the appeal are included in the final festive flourish to round off what has been one of Marie Curie’s most successful fundraisers of it’s kind in the UK.</p>
      <p>Ms McMillan said: “We couldn’t have done any of this without Courier readers so we hope that in providing this opportunity to own a precious piece of our treasure trove, readers will be reminded of the great strides we have taken together in helping families facing terminal illness across Tayside.</p>
      <p>“This year to date we’ve already managed to buy over 1,000 hours of high quality hands on free professional nursing care for individuals with a range of terminal conditions, including cancer, at home at the end of life.</p>
      <p>“Now, as the appeal draws to the close with the end of year, every £20 we raise will buy one more hour of care for someone in their time of need this Christmas.”</p>
      <p>Initially Marie Curie had hoped to source just enough raw material to fashion one new item for auction but the response surpassed everyone’s expectations.</p>
      <p>The fundraising drive marked the 70th anniversary of the charity’s inception by creating jewellery in aid of the local nursing service.</p>
      <p>Another piece, the Everest star – a 9ct gold and diamond star pendant worth £500 – was donated by Ms McMillan to commemorate her recent expedition to the Everest base camp in Nepal with 26 team mates from all over the UK.</p>
      <p>Two further items, a silver and amethyst bracelet and earrings – valued at £120 and £100 respectively – were donated to the Magpie Appeal and are also on offer.</p>
