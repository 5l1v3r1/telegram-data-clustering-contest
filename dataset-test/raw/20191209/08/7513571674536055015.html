        <b>A 38-year-old man in Kano state has changed his name to Muhammadu Buhari, the name of the president.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pictures of the man at his renaming ceremony circulated on social media. The event reportedly held at the Zoo road in Kano, the state capital, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>During the occasion, a ram was slaughtered as often experienced during naming ceremonies conducted, according to Islamic rites.</p>
      <p>Kano, a state in the north-west region governed by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), is the stronghold of President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>The state gave Buhari the highest votes in the 2015 and 2019 elections.</p>
      <p>When he ran against ex-President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015, Buhari polled 1,903, 999 votes  while his opponent got 215,779 votes.</p>
      <p>In 2019, Buhari won all the 44 local government areas of Kano with 1,464,768 million votes (78.9 percent of the total votes cast) to defeat Atiku Abubakar, who polled 391,593 (21.1 percent).</p>
