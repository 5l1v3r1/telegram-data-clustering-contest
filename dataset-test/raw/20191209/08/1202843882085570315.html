      <p>Doha: As part of an initiative to expand its services, Aster Medical Centre, a division of Aster OM Healthcare, the largest private healthcare network in the country,  has announced the opening of outpatient consultancy in plastic surgery. </p>
      <p>The new department will provide comprehensive out-patient services for different areas of plastic surgery including cosmetic surgery, coetaneous surgery, burns and others, said officials yesterday. </p>
      <p>Dr  Krishnakumar, one of the most reputed Plastic Surgeon in South India from Aster MIMS, Calicut –Kerala with over 25 years of experience will be a visiting consultant at Aster Medical Centre, AI Hilal. He is a senior consultant and head of the department of Plastic Surgery at Aster MIMS, Calicut.</p>
      <p>Dr Krishnakumar will visit Qatar once a month and will be here for a few days. He will conduct the out- patient consultancy at Aster Hilal and the procedures will be done at Aster Hospital. Any procedures that cannot be done at the Aster Hospital Doha will be referred to Aster Hospital in Kerala, said Dr Sameer Moopan Chief Executive Officer at Aster DMH Qatar, speaking at a press conference yesterday.   </p>
      <p>“There is a team of doctors at Aster Hospital who will assist him in the process and they will be available for the patients to provide consultations. There will also be opportunities to consult with Dr Krishankumar over the Internet and phone when he is not available in Qatar,” he added. </p>
      <p>Plastic surgery is a surgical speciality involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery.</p>
      <p>“There is a common misconception that cosmetic surgery and plastic surgery are very expensive and it takes long period for cure completely. But nowadays with the support of latest technology and equipment these are also same as other surgeries,” said Dr Krishankumar.</p>
      <p>“There are several types of plastic surgery and any limb can be attached perfectly to the body provided the cut off limb is brought on time. Moreover it is used for shaping most parts of the body by either augmenting or reducing the shape and size of the body parts,” he added. </p>
      <p>He also gave a presentation about the different types of plastic surgery and noted that the side effects of the surgery are as normal as any other treatment.  </p>
      <p>Sameer PT, Chief Operating Officer at Aster MIMS, Calicut highlighted that Aster hospitals in Kerala will be supporting Aster Qatar by providing the services of leading physicians in different specialities. “We have a good existing patient base from Qatar. I expect the new out-patient service will benefit everyone in need of plastic surgery related services. We will be also providing seamless connectivity and transition for patients if required to Aster MIMS Calicut.” </p>
