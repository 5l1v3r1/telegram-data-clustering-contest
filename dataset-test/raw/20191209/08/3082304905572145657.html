        <b>On Sunday, Singapore swimmer Amanda Lim won the 50m freestyle at the SEA Games 2019 – and in the process, broke the meet record and also qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amanda Lim set a new personal best for the first time in around ten years, finishing the race in 25.06 seconds, ahead of Thailand’s Jenjira Srisa-Ard (25.32 seconds) and Jasmine Alkhaldi (25.48 seconds) of the Philippines. The time set by Lim has also been declared as a SEA Games record.</p>
      <p>After winning the gold medal, Lim said: “My previous best was 25.3 and I haven’t done a PB in like 10 years.”</p>
      <p>“I’m really happy with 25.06. To do it again, to bring it back to Singapore for the sixth consecutive time, I’m speechless.”</p>
      <p>“The SEA Games is always something pretty special to me. Made my first team when I was 14 years old, and here I am standing at 26 and still going for it.”</p>
      <p>“I guess it’s just a passion for racing. My family’s in the stands, coming all the way from Singapore and I have family and relatives from back home watching on TV,” she concluded.</p>
      <p>Earlier, during the heats itself, Amanda Lim had matched the Olympic B-Cut time of 25.51 seconds, to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>Singapore’s swimmers won three other golds in the SEA Games 2019 on Sunday – Lionel Khoo in the 50m breaststroke, Darren Chua in the 100m freestyle and the 4x100m relay team of Quah, her sister Jing Wen, Christie Chue and Elena Pedersen.</p>
