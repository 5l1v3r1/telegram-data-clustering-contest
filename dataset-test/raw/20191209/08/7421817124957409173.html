      <p>A son of the late former vice-president Michael Kijana Wamalwa, William Makali Wamalwa, is dead.</p>
      <p>His uncle, Robert Wamalwa, Monday confirmed that his nephew died on Sunday evening at their Milimani home in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County.</p>
      <p>The family suspects it could be diabetes that led to his death but are waiting for a post-mortem report.</p>
      <p>"My nephew was diabetic and that might have led to his death but, of course, when the official post-mortem report is out, we will know what happened," Mr Wamalwa told the <i>Nation</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>UNIVERSITY STUDENT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Makali, who was the third born in his family, was in his mid-20s and was a second year student at the University of Nairobi where he was studying commerce.</p>
      <p>His uncle dismissed claims on social media that Makali died of depression, alcoholism and drug abuse.</p>
      <p>"It is far from the truth. It is very unfair and people should not capitalise on something like that. They should respect the family and the dead," said Mr Wamalwa.</p>
      <p>He added that he was with his nephew the previous day and he looked fine.</p>
      <p>An official family statement will be given after a post-mortem examination report is released.</p>
      <p>Makali will be buried at the family’s Three Rivers farm in Saboti on December 14, 2019.</p>
