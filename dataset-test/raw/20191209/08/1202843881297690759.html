      <p>Doha: The General Services Affairs Sector at the Ministry of Municipality and Environmental (MME) in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) has launched a programme for sorting wastes at  source and recycling it at the headquarters of the Ministry of Public Health and health centres run by the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC).</p>
      <p>The initiative was taken under a major plan of the General Cleanliness Department to implement the programme all over the country. The launch ceremony was attended by Safar Mubarak Al Shafi, Assistant Undersecretary for General Services Affairs at MME; Abdullah Ibrahim Al Emadi, Assistant Undersecretary for Shared Services Affairs at MoPH, and a number of officials from the two ministries.</p>
      <p>Al Shafi said the waste sorting and recycling programme in Qatar comes within the framework of the great interest that the ministry attaches to developing its services in order to preserve the environment and its safety and achieve sustainable development.</p>
      <p>He said the programme was launched following the ministry’s sustainable strategic plan, which aims to reduce the amount of waste, maintain environmental safety, benefit economically from waste recycling, achieve sustainable development, conserve natural resources, support the private sector, and contribute to the achievement of the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>
      <p>Al Shafi emphasised the ministry’s commitment to protect the environment and reduce environmental damage, noting that the waste sorting and recycling programme will help preserve natural resources, support private sector companies and encourage them on waste management.</p>
