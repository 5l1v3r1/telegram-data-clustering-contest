      <h1>A new BioShock game is in development</h1>
      <h2>A new studio will be led by Kelley Gilmore, a veteran of XCOM and Civilization.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:45:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/dan.cooper.12" target="_blank">Daniel Cooper</a></address>
      <p>2K Games has announced the formation of a new studio, Cloud Chamber, which will take the lead on a new title in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/30/bioshock-collection-remastered-ps4-xbox-one-pc/"><i>Bioshock</i></a> series. Cloud Chamber has offices in California and Montreal, and will be headed up by 2K veteran Kelley Gilmore, who has previously worked on <i>Civilization</i> and <i>XCOM</i>.</p>
      <p>As well as Gilmore, <i>Bioshock</i> veterans Hoagy de le Plante, Scott Sinclair and Jonathan Pelling are also involved. One name that isn't mentioned is original creator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/28/ken-levine-hints-at-new-first-person-sci-fi-adventure/">Ken Levine</a>, who has moved on to work on a new title at Ghost Story Games, and isn't likely to have any influence here.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/we-have-a-myriad-of-ideas-cloud-chambers-kelley-gilmore-reveals-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-next-bioshock-game/">GamesRadar</a></i>, Gilmore says that <i>Bioshock's</i> unique environments -- from the underwater city of Rapture to the floating city of Columbia and, uh, back to Rapture -- are "incredibly important to the gameplay experience." She added that there are plenty of "creative directions to explore," which might hint that the team will find a new setting for this fourth title in the saga.</p>
      <p>The announcement tallies with rumors that have swirled around the industry since last year, claiming that work on this game began at the tail-end of <i>Mafia III's</i> development. According to a lengthy <i><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">Kotaku</a></i> report, Mafia studio Hangar 13 was raided for talent by an unnamed studio for a secret <i>Bioshock</i> game.</p>
      <p>2K's announcement says that the title will be in development for "the next several years," and so expect this to drop long after the next-generation of consoles have launched.</p>
