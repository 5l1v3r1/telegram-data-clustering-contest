      <h2>Such ceremonies were put on hold after a High Court ruling in July.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:55:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author">Órla Ryan</a></address>
      <p>SOME 2,000 PEOPLE from 103 countries will become Irish citizens at ceremonies in Co Kerry today.</p>
      <p>Such ceremonies were put on hold after High Court judge Mr Justice Max Barrett ruled in July that anyone applying for citizenship could not spend a day outside Ireland in the 12 months before applying.</p>
      <p>Last month the Court of Appeal <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/unworkable-and-unduly-rigid-high-court-finding-on-citizenship-application-overturned-4892148-Nov2019/">overturned this ruling</a>, calling it “unduly rigid” and “unworkable” .</p>
      <p>Today’s ceremonies will take place at 11.30am and 2.25pm at the Convention Centre in Killarney.</p>
      <p>Justice and Equality Minister Charlie Flanagan and Minister of State David Stanton will attend the events, which will be presided over by retired High Court Judge Bryan McMahon.</p>

      <p>This is the second year when large-scale citizenship ceremonies have been held outside Dublin. The Convention Centre in Killarney will be the location for large citizenship ceremonies in the future.</p>
      <p>Citizenship ceremonies were first introduced in 2011. There have been 145 ceremonies (including today) since then with people from over 180 countries receiving their certificates of naturalisation.</p>
      <p>Approximately 127,000 people, including minors, have received Irish citizenship in the last 18 years.</p>
      <p>The top nationalities that will be represented at today’s ceremonies include Poland, the UK, Romania, India and Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Thousands more people are expected to receive Irish citizenship in early 2020 following the backlog created by temporary suspension of ceremonies.</p>
