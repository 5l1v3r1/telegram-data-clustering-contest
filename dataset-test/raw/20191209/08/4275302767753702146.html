      <p>Gary Davidson appeared back in the dock at Forfar Sheriff Court after being a six-month chance to behave himself following the incident in a catalogue of threatening behaviour towards the woman.</p>
      <p>Davidson, 21, of Deanbank House, Glamis had previously admitted the offences which took place last year at a property in Clova Road, Kirriemuir and the Forfar fast food restaurant.</p>
      <p>The court heard the couple had rowed on May 25 when the accused found out his girlfriend was going on a holiday to Lanzarote which she had booked during a break in their on-off relationship.</p>
      <p>The victim was on her mobile phone at that time and there was a struggle between them as Davidson tried to get it.</p>
      <p>The fast food restaurant offence happened when the couple decided to drive from Kirriemuir to Forfar but en route Davidson began to get angry and accused the woman of being untruthful.</p>
      <p>His partner began to cry and when they arrived at KFC she said she didn’t want anything to eat.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Jill Drummond said staff at the drive-thru could hear Davidson shouting and screaming at her.</p>
      <p>“He drove to the window and acted polite to the witness, but the complainer was observed to be upset and turned her head away,” the fiscal added.</p>
      <p>The victim was recording Davidson’s torrent of abuse on her mobile phone and he repeated an earlier threat, telling her: “I tell you, you will be going in a f****** shallow hole.”</p>
      <p>She was then dropped off at her home by the accused, but around 6.30pm he turned up there. Despite being asked to leave he repeatedly rang the doorbell, to the point where the victim had to remove it.</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Nick Markowski said: “The parties were involved for about four years but the last 12 months were pretty difficult.</p>
      <p>“He wishes to apologise. He is a first offender and they are no longer together, but have seen each other out in Kirriemuir since and there have been no difficulties.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Derek Reekie said: “It sounds to me like there was a lot of tension in your relationship and a lot of jealousy and immaturity.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately there has been no repeat of this sort of difficulty.</p>
      <p>“You were given six months to prove this was not a pattern of behaviour, you’ve taken that opportunity and I give you full credit for that.”</p>
      <p>He fined Davidson £550.</p>
