      <p>Newcastle United are experiencing dizzy heights after entering the Premier League's top 10.</p>
      <p>The 2-1 win saw goals from Jonjo Shelvey and Federico Fernandez net three points and there were no shortage of speakers after the game.</p>
      <p>Here's what was said in the mixed zone after the game.</p>

      <p>It was a tough game - we didn't really play well, both teams played a lot of long balls</p>
      <p>But, even in the tough moment, when they scored, we tried to push, tried to play to Andy (Carroll) and create chances and put the ball in the box</p>
      <p>At the end, I see Longs (Sean Longstaff) have a great shot - and I followed the ball.</p>
      <p>I was in the right place, at the right moment</p>
      <p>I am  happy to score here, at home, with all of the fans.</p>
      <p>We are working hard to keep our shape. We feel OK, we took our chances.</p>
      <p>We need to enjoy this period and build a winning mentality.</p>
      <p>You never know where we can arrive at the end of the season but we take it game-by-game.</p>

      <p>I was looking to set the ball back in for somebody else to cross it in like at Sheff United.</p>
      <p>But nobody was there and I thought I'd have to put it in myself.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jonjo-shelvey">Jonjo</a> was there and he's ran in from the edge of the box.  </p>
      <p>I am waiting for one, hopefully he returns the favour next game!</p>

      <p>We were by no means (at) the levels we’ve been at in the past few games, but sometimes you hear the big teams have gone to places and won ugly.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">We’ve done</a> that today.</p>
      <p>It’s definitely a skill to have, because we were nowhere near it really first half, but second half we came out with a bit more spirit, a bit more fight and a bit more desire to get forward and create chances.</p>
      <p>

      <p>We want to push as high as we can and get into the Europa League spots. That is obviously the aim.</p>
      <p>But first of all we need to get this club to safety and go from there.</p>
      <p>In my opinion there is no reason why we can't get this club back into European football.</p>
      <p>What a place it would be next year if we were in Europe and travelling all over the world.</p>
