      <p>Spear is an acronym for “Stop Poaching Our Endangered African Rhino”. Its main aim is to create awareness and attract funding for the role players on the front lines. The CEO of Spear, Estelle Roe, explained that the greatest assets in the park are the rangers.</p>
      <p>The aim of the awards was to credit the rangers, prosecutors, pilots and police officers for their relentless work, but also to bring local businesses into the fight against poaching.</p>

      <p>hese heroes over the years have fought relentlessly against the onslaught that the Marula South region, also known as the Intensive Protection Zone (IZP), has experienced from rhino poaching syndicates for the past decade.</p>
      <p>The rangers were involved in more armed contacts per day than the SANDF soldiers were during the Border War. This team has, through its individual efforts, played a major role in the drastic year-on-year reduction of 48 per cent in rhino poaching since 2016.</p>
