      <p>An inquest has been opened following the death of a man in Swadlincote.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/inquests">Derby Coroners' Court</a> heard how Alan Whyatt died on November 16 and was found by his brother at an address in <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/swadlincote">Ernest Hall Way</a> in the town.</p>
      <p>Dr Robert Hunter, senior coroner for Derby and Derbyshire, said he had been "drinking and using heroin and crack cocaine" in the previous 24 hours before his death.</p>
      <p>Dr Hunter also read out a pathologist's report during the hearing which stated that the cause of death "awaits further tests".</p>
      <p>The hearing was told Mr Whyatt, of no fixed abode, was born on March 21, 1978, and had been a ground worker.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the hearing Dr Hunter said: "Alan Whyatt had been drinking and using heroin and crack cocaine in the previous 24 hours before his death.</p>
      <p>"He had fallen asleep. Someone went to wake him and found he wasn't breathing.</p>
      <p>"I adjourn the inquest and expect a police report within the next eight weeks."</p>
