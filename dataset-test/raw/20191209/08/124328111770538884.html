      <p>l’m A Celeb’s Jacqueline Jossa has become the first winner to EVER cancel live TV and newspaper interviews after Chloe Ayling's claim she had a threesome with her husband in 2018, little more than 12-months after the couple exchanged vows.</p>
      <p>The latest news came after the couple looked incredibly loved up when they reunited after Jacqueline, 27, was crowned jungle queen on <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/index.html"><b>I'm A Celebrity</b></a> on Sunday - but this was before she had chance to read any of the reports.   </p>
      <p>Now people are wondering if the star will call time on her marriage which has been plagued by cheating rumours, all of which Dan, 28, has previously denied.   </p>

      <p>Traditionally a key feature on breakfast TV, Lorraine Kelly admitted she would not be interviewing this year's winner while giving viewers a run-down of her daily show on Monday morning.. </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/eastenders/index.html"><b>EastEnders</b></a> actress Jacqueline beat <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/coronation_street/index.html"><b>Corrie</b></a>'s Andy Whyment to be given the winner's title after taking on gruelling final Bushtucker trials which saw Jacqueline hold a huntsman spider in her mouth and Andy, 38, eat a camel's hoof. </p>
      <p>But despite weeks of reports of cheating claims made against Dan amid rumours that Myles Stephenson, 28, had told Jacqueline that Gabby Allen, 25, did have a fling with her husband, all appeared well between them. </p>

        <figcaption>'I'm absolutely fine': Jacqueline broke her silence on Instagram on Monday and called the show 'the best thing she's ever done' hinting that she has decided to trust her husband </figcaption>

      <p>But hours later, Lorraine Kelly said on ITV that she had decided to decline post-jungle interviews on Monday, despite all other campmates taking part after leaving the jungle. </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for I'm A Celebrity told MailOnline: 'Jacqueline wants to spend as much time as possible with her family in OZ before they have to travel back to the UK. Plus she’s filming Coming Out.'</p>
      <p>Separate sources have since claimed Jacqueline is keen to avoid all publicity - some of which comes with a lucrative fee - opting instead to devote her remaining time in Australia to husband Dan and their two children, Ella, four, and 18-month old Mia. </p>
      <p>'She has to film for the coming out show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family,' an insider told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/lm-celeb-winner-jacqueline-jossa-21055373"><b>The Mirror</b></a>.  </p>

        <figcaption>Where is he? There was no sign of Myles in the crowd who had taken Jacqueline to one side in the jungle and spoke to her about claims his ex Gabby Allen did have a fling with Daniel </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When asked how ITV had handled telling Jacqueline about the claims from an aftercare perspective, they added: 'The duty of care of all of our contestants is of the utmost importance to us. We take the welfare of all of the celebrities very seriously and have measures in place to ensure they are supported at every stage of the process.'</p>
      <p>In March, Dan denied claims he had kissed <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/love-island/index.html"><b>Love Island</b></a>'s Alexandra Cane behind Jacqueline's back and a month after that, he also denied a fling with his PR pal Steph Ledigo. </p>
      <p>And in 2015, he spoke of his regret over staying at his ex Megan's house (the mother of his son, Teddy) as this lead to cheating rumours. </p>
