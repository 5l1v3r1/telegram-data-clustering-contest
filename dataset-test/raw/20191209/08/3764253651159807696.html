      <p>However, the victory was not enough to help the Nigerian-British born fighter climb the heavyweight ranking ladder as he was seen down the line behind the WBC champion and <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1262805-tyson-fury--career-highlights-wife-mental-health-net-worth.html">Tyson Fury</a>, his countryman.</p>
      <p>Wilder sealed the top having successfully defended his WBC heavyweight belt for tenth time include an <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278427-wilder-ortiz-bronze-bomber-knocks-opponent-retain-wbc-heavyweight-title.html">epochal victory over Cuban fighter Luis Ortiz</a> in Las Vega.</p>
      <p>And with 41 knock-out wins in 43 professional fights, Wilder has a point to prove as a top star of the division.</p>
