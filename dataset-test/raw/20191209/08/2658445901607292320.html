      <p>A large fire has swept through a bag factory in the Indian capital Delhi, killing 43 workers, officials say.</p>
      <p>The blaze broke out at the four-storey building in the city’s congested old quarter early yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>At least 100 people were sleeping inside the factory, which mainly makes school bags, when the fire started. More than 60 have been rescued.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the fire “horrific” and sent his condolences.</p>
      <p>Delhi’s firefighters received the first call about the fire at 05:22 local time yesterday.</p>
      <p>The fire began on the lower storeys, spreading rapidly to the third floor where workers were sleeping.</p>
      <p>“We woke up with cries and shouts for help,” said Ronak Khan, a 17-year-old living next door.</p>
      <p>“I saw people trapped. We asked them to come to the rooftop so that we could rescue them but they were not able to come up.”</p>
      <p>The area where the factory is located – Azad Market – is a web of narrow alleyways, which made it difficult to reach the blaze.</p>
      <p>Rescuers had to carry out victims on their shoulders one-by-one with firefighters cutting away window grills to access the building.</p>
      <p>A local fire chief told BBC Hindi’s Dilnawaz Pasha the building did not have a proper fire licence and was operating illegally as a factory.</p>
      <p>It is not clear what caused the blaze but an investigation has been ordered.</p>
      <p>An initial probe and eyewitnesses suggested a short circuit may have been to blame.</p>
      <p>Victims’ relatives have been scrambling for information. One man told India’s PTI agency his brother was inside.</p>
      <p>Indian cities have often seen deadly fires, with poor planning and lax enforcement of safety regulations major factors.</p>
      <p>Indian politicians have been expressing their horror at the blaze.</p>
      <p>“The fire in Delhi’s Anaj Mandi on Rani Jhansi Road is extremely horrific,” Prime Minister Modi tweeted.</p>
      <p>“My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. Wishing the injured a quick recovery. Authorities are providing all possible assistance at the site of the tragedy.”</p>
      <p>Home Minister Amit Shah called it a “tragic loss of precious lives”.</p>
