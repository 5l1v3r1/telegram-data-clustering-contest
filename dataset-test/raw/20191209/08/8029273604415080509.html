      <p>The National Assembly decided Monday to suspend voting on fiercely contested fast-tracked bills, including election and prosecutorial reforms, and postpone its plenary session until Tuesday.</p>

      <p>National Assembly Speaker Moon Hee-sang drew the floor leaders of three major parties -- the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, Liberty Korea Party and minor conservative Bareunmirae Party -- to the agreement, following the election of the Liberty Korea Party’s new floor leader, Shim Jae-cheol.</p>
      <p>The longstanding battle over the passage of the reform proposals came to an interim cease-fire as the Liberty Korea Party retracted its earlier decision to stage a filibuster on pending bills at the parliament.</p>
      <p>“We will consider withdrawing our decision to stage a filibuster after the party meeting,” Shim said to reporters after the meeting with his fellow party leaders.</p>
      <p>The Liberty Korea Party had consistently refused to recant its filibuster despite repeated calls from the ruling Democratic Party and other minor parties.</p>
      <p>The parliament will vote on next year’s budget and review other less contentious bills Tuesday, when it convenes a last plenary session before it opens a special session the following day.</p>
      <p>While the election and prosecutorial reform bills are postponed to a later vote after Tuesday, it remains unclear exactly when the parliament will see those bills pass during the special session that starts Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some political experts speculate that newly elected Floor Leader Shim Jae-cheol of the Liberty Korea Party will check on his superior, Chairman Hwang Kyo-ahn, criticized on occasions for his domineering and dogmatic leadership.</p>
      <p>Having served as deputy speaker in 2017, five-term lawmaker Shim is considered a political strategist who can power through difficulties the Liberty Korea Party now faces.</p>
      <p>In the party election, Shim gained 52 out of 106 votes.</p>
      <p>Rep. Kim Jae-won, a three-term lawmaker, was elected as the conservative party’s new policy chief.</p>
      <p>Shim’s election came after two rounds of voting, as none of the four contenders won a majority in the first vote. Shim, who received 39 votes in the first round, competed against Rep. Kang Seok-ho and Rep. Kim Seon-dong, who scored 28 votes each.</p>
      <p>The new floor leader will succeed the outgoing Na Kyung-won, whose one-year term ends Tuesday upon the party’s decision not to renew her tenure.</p>
      <p>“With humility, I will devote myself to the party,” Shim said to his fellow lawmakers at his acceptance speech. “With you, we will win the general election next year.”</p>
