      <h1>Man who hasn't cut his floor-length hair in 20 years to chop it off for charity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:29:42+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:29</time> by <a rel="author">Natalie Morris</a></address>
      <p>A man who has been growing his hair for 20 years has finally decided to get it cut off – and is raising thousands for charity in the process.</p>
      <p>Andrew Cozin, who lives in Vauxhall, south London, started growing his hair when he was just 14, in 2000. Now, it reaches the floor and he can even use it as a scarf during the colder months.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old can’t really remember why he started growing his locks, but it soon became a personal mission as he knew he wanted to use it to help people in need.</p>
      <p>But living with hair long enough to trip over isn’t always easy.</p>
      <p>‘I never decided in advance how long was long enough and so it just kept going,’ Andrew tells Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>‘Living with too much hair can result in frequent neck and back pain, and make job interviews that bit more challenging.</p>

      <p>‘As my hair has grown over time, I’ve made adjustments to ensure it’s out of the way when going about mundane, daily tasks. Generally, it just requires awareness and an ability to tie it up and out of the way whenever necessary.’</p>
      <p>Andrew says he often catches sly glances from people if they think he isn’t looking, but he much prefers the reaction he tends to get from kids.</p>
      <p>‘Children are the funniest because as they stare, they have a tendency to look like they’ve seen a ghost,’ he says.</p>
      <p>‘Some people have particularly enthusiastic reactions and will run up from a distance to tell me how much they love my hair and insist that I must never, ever cut it.’</p>
      <p>Andrew says he has been growing his hair for 20 years because he didn’t want to cut it off until he had found the perfect charitable cause.</p>
      <p>‘The one thing I was certain of, from very early on, was that when I did finally cut my hair, I wanted to do it to help a charity that I could wholeheartedly support. It literally took years to find “the one”.’</p>

      <p>In fact, Andrew, who works as a project manager at homeless support centre <a href="https://streetlytes.org/streetlyteslondon/en/page/home-page">StreetLytes</a>, volunteered at several different charities before making his decision.</p>
      <p>But finally, he landed on <a href="http://aceofclubs.org.uk/?LMCL=HrAD9v">Ace of Clubs</a> – a charity offering support for the homeless and vulnerable. Andrew describes it as ‘a place where those marginalised can find acceptance, a sense of belonging, and renewed purpose to see their lives restored.’</p>
      <p>Andrew knew that whatever charity he chose to support, the issue of homelessness would have to be at it’s core.</p>
      <p>‘More than ten years ago, I made a decision never to ignore a homeless person, no matter how uncomfortable their circumstances might make me feel,’ explains Andrew.</p>
      <p>‘They are no less human than you or me, and deserve just as much respect. Now, when I travel home, I wonder who I might see just outside my tube station. I know their names because they’re my neighbours.’</p>
      <p>Andrew has been volunteering at Ace of Clubs since 2017, and he says he finds it endlessly rewarding. He says what really strikes him is the similarities he sees between himself and the people he works to support.</p>
      <p>‘The distinguishing feature between us is luck, nothing else,’ he says. ‘I’m just glad that there is a place where they can go and feel welcome, safe, and have their concerns appropriately addressed.</p>
      <p>‘Ace of Clubs doesn’t receive any government funding and is financially supported almost exclusively through donations and grants.</p>
      <p>‘I’m just doing my part to help keep the doors open, ovens on, and showers running.’</p>

      <p>Andrew is aiming to raise £5,000 – and once he hits that target, he’ll be getting the big chop. But he isn’t daunted at the prospect of such a drastic change of style.</p>
      <p>‘I think I’ll feel relieved when my hair is finally cut,’ says Andrew. ‘Often people suggest that I’m going to have some sort of identity crisis when I finally cut my hair, but I know that won’t be the case.</p>
      <p>‘I never actively sought out hair this long; it has been years of inaction that’s gotten me to this point. I had no idea when I was fourteen that I would still be without a haircut all these years later.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been ready for ages; it’s just taken this long to find Ace of Clubs and to raise the funds. Hopefully we can hit the mark before Christmas.’</p>
      <p>At the time of writing this article, Andrew has raised £4,000 – that’s 80% of his total target. You can help him get over the line by <a href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=AndrewCozin&amp;pageUrl=1">donating to his fundraising page</a>.</p>
      <p>We will keep you updated with Andrew’s journey and hope to film the moment when he finally cuts off his epic tresses.</p>
