      <h1>Fulham fans copy Leeds United in starting petition against referee Jeremy Simpson after Bristol City win</h1>
      <h2>The referee failed to award a late penalty to the hosts</h2>

      <p>Fulham fans have set up a petition to ban referee Jeremy Simpson following Bristol City's 2-1 win at Craven Cottage on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">The Robins</a> ran out winners after taking a two-goal lead, with Josh Brownhill and Famara Diedhiou finding the net.</p>
      <p>Yet Aboubakar's goal four minutes from time set up a nervy finish, and the Cottagers thought they should have had a penalty when Neeskens Kebano went down following a tackle from Callum O'Dowda, but referee Simpson waved play on.</p>

      <p>Launched on Change.org, the petition says: "Jeremy Simpson has caused danger for Fulham as we drop more significant points.</p>
      <p>"He called many fouls against Fulham and even a controversial penalty decision and handing out yellow cards left, right and centre, he couldn't control his own game."</p>
      <p>So far, just 90 fans have signed the petition, but some have commented on it, with Vince Newman arguing 'there were too many wrong decisions, including crucial ones that were so straightforward, it is just unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Barry Clements said: "Shocking decision for the non-penalty at the end."</p>
      <p>The petition also attracted comment on Twitter, with some fans backing it.</p>
      <p><b>Friends of Fulham:</b> Fulham fans, if you were also unimpressed with Jeremy Simpson's performance, then make sure you sign the Jeremy Simpson Out petition.</p>
      <p><b>Henry:</b> Please talk about Jeremy Simpson's shocker at Fulham.</p>
      <p><b>Deborah Gil:</b> We should have VAR, it should be available for all teams, then he can be proved wrong on many of his decisions.</p>
      <p><b>Evan Russell:</b> Not a fan of singling out referees but that was embarrassing.</p>
      <p><b>Graying Sideburns:</b> Jeremy Simpson's performance today was terrible.</p>
      <p>The petition was even picked up by Leeds fans, who created their own petition against Simpson last season.</p>
      <p>That proved to be even more popular, with over 2,500 people signing it.</p>
