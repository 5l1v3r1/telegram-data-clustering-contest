      <p>A Tipperary dentist who went out of his way to treat a victim of domestic violence has been named Caring Dentist of the Year.</p>
      <p>Padraig O’Reachtagáin not only repaired the woman’s broken tooth but showed her and her children a way out of a violent situation.</p>
      <p>The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, said Dr O’Reachtagáin opened his practice on a Saturday morning just to treat her.</p>
      <p>“He was caring, compassionate, and also advised me on the avenues I could go down to get myself and my children into a much safer environment,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Myself and my children are safe due to his care and understanding. He truly deserves this award,” she said.</p>
      <p>The woman, who nominated Dr O’Reachtagáin for the top award, is donating her prize of €1,500 to Women’s Aid.</p>
      <p>Dr O’Reachtagáin, who is almost 40 years in dentistry, said he worked in a practice in East London in the 1980s that was very close to a refuge for women experiencing domestic violence.</p>
      <p>“I learned that domestic abuse and violence was a lot more prevalent than we all like to think,” he said.</p>
      <blockquote>I also learned that it was an issue which, while shrouded in secrecy, affected women from all walks of life.</blockquote>
      <p>Guiney Dental in Ballincollig, Co Cork, was named Dental Team of the Year because of their care when treating a young man with mental health issues.</p>
      <p>Wrightville Dental Clinic in Douglas, Cork, was runner up for their care of a patient with bulimia.</p>
      <p>The patient said the clinic “helped me change my life”.</p>
      <p>Claire O’Connor from Bantry Dental in Co Cork won the Munster award for diagnosing a woman with shingles.</p>
