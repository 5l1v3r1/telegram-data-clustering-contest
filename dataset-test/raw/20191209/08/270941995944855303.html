        <b>Chancellor Angela Merkel's party on Sunday reacted coolly to concessions sought by the new leaders of the Social Democrats in return for keeping their fragile coalition afloat</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It's bad for Germany when every important decision depends on how the SPD is feeling at that moment," Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of Merkel's CDU conservatives, told the Bild am Sonntag daily.</p>
      <p>At a crunch party congress this weekend, the ailing SPD voted against an immediate exit from the government.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>But new leadership duo Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken won the party's backing to steer a more leftwing course.</p>
      <p>The party backed them to open "discussions" with Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc on demands including a higher minimum wage, more public investment and more climate action.</p>
      <p>No timeframe has been given but talks could start as early as this week, according to German media.</p>
      <p>If no progress is made, the SPD could call it quits -- potentially upending Merkel's plan to complete her fourth term before retiring from politics in 2021.</p>
      <p>Kramp-Karrenbauer, seen as Merkel's preferred successor, said she had hoped for a "clearer commitment" from the SPD to continue governing.</p>
      <p>She slammed the party for trying to tweak the hard-fought coalition agreement clinched after 2017's inconclusive general elections, pointing out that leadership changes at the CDU and CSU never put the left-right coalition at stake.</p>
      <p>"The CDU is loyal to the agreement and I expect the same from the new SPD leadership," she told Bild.</p>
      <p>"I can't accept conditions along the lines of 'If we don't get this, we walk'."</p>
      <p>The secretary general of the CSU, Markus Blume, was equally scathing.</p>
      <p>"An SPD on a leftist course won't lead to a government on a leftist course," he tweeted.</p>

        <b>'Absurd'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The CDU's deputy chairman Armin Laschet however was more conciliatory, saying he was willing to discuss the SPD's push to raise the incoming CO2 price from a proposed €10 per tonne.</p>
      <p>He said the proposal did not mean a complete reopening of the government's already agreed climate package, which is working its way through parliament and still needs backing from sceptical Green MPs too.</p>
      <p>Far more contentious is the SPD's call to invest some €450 billion over the next 10 years in schools, transport and digitalisation projects.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, the government would have to stop clinging to its "black zero" policy of maintaining a balanced budget and not taking on new debts -- anathema to the CDU and CSU.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Merkel herself just last month touted the "record-high" investments planned in the government's 2020 budget, adding that it was "absurd" to run up new debts.</p>
      <p>Weakened by a series of election drubbings, the SPD is hoping to sharpen its profile with the list of demands.</p>
      <p>But if the upcoming talks fail, Germany faces the rare prospect of snap polls or a Merkel-led minority government.</p>
