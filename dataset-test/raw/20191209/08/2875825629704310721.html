      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> 's proud parents celebrated her I'm A Celebrity victory - but left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> out of their family portait.</p>
      <p>Selina and John Jossa posed up with their daughter after she was crowned Queen of the Jungle last night.</p>
      <p>As she donned her flower crown and wooden sceptre, the former EastEnders star beamed a big smile as she stood between her parents.</p>
      <p>Selina also took the opportunity to try Jac's crown on and pose up with her sceptre, as well as don the sleeveless fleece with her daughter's name and voting number emblazoned across the back.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Very proud moment watching your daughter being crowned queen of the jungle what a great day to excel love mum and dad @jacjossa"</p>

      <p>But Jac's husband Dan was nowhere to be seen, being left out of the family photo.</p>
      <p>It comes after more cheating claims emerged against Dan.</p>
      <p>His former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> housemate Choe Ayling came forward to claim that she and Dan had a threesome with US reality star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-natalie-nunn-celebrity-big-13090053">Natalie Nunn</a> behind his wife's back following their time in the famous house.</p>
      <p>She claimed to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10492866/chloe-ayling-dan-osborne-threesome-jacqueline-jossa-threesome/">The Sun</a> that after a night of boozing and partying - which saw the stars papped together - they went back to a hotel and engaged in sexual activity together.</p>
      <p>Chloe claims that she watched Dan have full sex with Natalie, who was married to American football player Jacob Payne at the time, before kissing and performing a sex act on Chloe.</p>

      <p>But Dan angrily denied that anything happened between them.</p>
      <p>While they did go out partying together that night, Dan says that absolutely nothing happened between them.</p>
      <p>He denies being unfaithful to Jacqueline, who is currently in the I'm A Celebrity jungle and will be unaware of these news claims.</p>
      <p>A representative for Dan told Mirror Online: "This story is not true and Dan will be seeking legal advice."</p>

      <p>Natalie's representatives refused to comment on the story when we contacted them.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline's representatives did not want to comment on the claims either.</p>
      <p>Dan, who shares daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, with Jacqueline has faced a number of cheating claims in the past, including rumours that he hooked up with former Love Island babe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , but he has always protested his innocence, as has Gabby.</p>
