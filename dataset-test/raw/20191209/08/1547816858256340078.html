      <p>She told a section of media, “It is actually a nice coincidence that our trailer is getting launched on the 10th of December, which also happens to be - Human Rights Day. Chhapaak is a story of acid violence. The basic act of acid violence violates the human rights of the person who is attacked by acid and their life, their physicality is changed forever. So I really couldn't have asked for better synchronicity for the release date of our film. So that's why the date of the trailer release is extremely significant.”</p>
      <p>Well, we are sure you can’t wait for the trailer to be dropped!</p>
