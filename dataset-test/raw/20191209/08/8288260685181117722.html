      <p>Aston Villa are interested in signing exciting youngster Rayhaan Tulloch from West Bromwich Albion, according to reports.</p>
      <p>18-year-old Tulloch has scored three goals in his last four games for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion’s</a> Under-23s and will be watched by a host of scouts in the clash against Manchester United on Monday.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7767377/Premier-League-clubs-keeping-tabs-West-Brom-starlet-Rayhaan-Tulloch-ahead-Man-United-meeting.html">Daily Mail,</a> a representative from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> will be among them with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith’s</a> side keeping tabs on the forward’s progress.</p>
      <p>Tulloch, who can play upfront as well as on each wing, has been in the Baggies academy since he was nine and played twice in the FA Cup last season but it is reported he could be ready to move in the summer because of the competition to get into <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/slaven-bilic">Slaven Bilic’s</a> first-team.</p>
      <p>Albion are flying at the top of the Championship and have Hal Robson-Kanu, Charlie Austin and Kenneth Zohore to choose from upfront while the likes of Matheus Pereira, Grady Diangana and Matt Phillips are excelling as part of an attacking midfield in support.</p>
      <p>England Under-18 international Tulloch is also being watched by Newcastle United, Bournemouth and Southampton, while Championship sides Leeds United, Stoke City and Wigan Athletic are said to have asked about a potential loan deal in January.</p>
      <p>There is reportedly interest from League One Sunderland too, who are also keen on a temporary switch.</p>
