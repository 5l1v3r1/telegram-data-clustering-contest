      <p>Johannesburg – On Sunday Zozibini Tunzi <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/Pageant/miss-south-africa-zozibini-tunzi-crowned-miss-universe-20191209"><b>took home the title of the 68th Miss Universe</b></a>, but that's not all she's walking away with. </p>
      <p>The beauty queen's life is forever changed, and the next year especially will be a whirl-wind experience as she moves to a new city and takes on all the duties that come with the crown. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how Zozibini's life will change now that she is Miss Universe:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Joining the sisterhood</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pageant winners often talk about the bond that's created between themselves and other contestants as well as previous winners, and it's no different with the Miss Universe competition.</p>
      <p>Part of wearing the crown means that Zozbini joins the <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/Pageant/watch-demi-leighs-message-to-zozibini-tunzi-we-did-it-again-20191209"><b>Miss Universe sisterhood</b></a> and will always be recognised as a recipient of the title.</p>
      <p>Holding the title also allows Zozi to put her name on the global map, opening her up to a world of possibilities even after her reign ends. </p>

      <p>
        <b>2. The dream job</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, it's filled with glitz and glamour, but at the end of the day, being Miss Universe is actually considered a job. That means that the winner earns a year-long salary for serving duties that comes along with the title. </p>

      <p>
        <b>3. Hello, New York!</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the next year, Zozibini will be set up in a luxurious New York City apartment which she will share with the current Miss USA. </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. (Glam) squad goals</b>
      </p>
      <p>All of Zozibini's PR will now be taken care of by the Miss Universe Organisation who also manages Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.</p>
      <p>The beauty queen will have access to a number of star-studded events where she will get the chance to rub shoulders with Hollywood's elite. A glam-squad and, of course, designer couture will always be on standby to make sure our queen looks her best.</p>
