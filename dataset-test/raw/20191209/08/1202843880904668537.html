      <p>The Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to the State of Qatar, H E Hans-Udo Muzel said that friendship and cooperation between the two countries is not limited to business, as Berlin is partnering with Doha in many other fields to jointly tackle the challenges of the future, saying that Qatar is an important partner for his country during its non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council in 2019-2020, sharing a common vision of a multilateral framework based on a rules-based world order.</p>
      <p>In an execlusive statement to Qatar News Agency (QNA) on the occasion of Qatar National Day, the Ambassador said that Germany has partnered with Qatar for a very successful German Cultural Season in the past, expressing hope to build on all these positive examples of a fruitful co-operation with Qatari friends to strengthen bilateral relations even further.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador said that the future looks bright for the bilateral relations between Germany and Qatar, pointing out that these relations is based on the deep personal trust and long-standing relations that has grown over decades between the two countries’ peoples and business representatives, adding that the 6th session of the Joint Ministerial Economic Commission,which was held earlier this year and co-chaired by the Qatari and German Ministers of Economy and trade, will greatly contribute to enhancing bilateral economic, business, investment and energy cooperation which have been praised by both Amir H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and H E Dr. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
      <p>More than 100 German companies operate in Doha, some of them open their offices even before the independence of Qatar in 1971, these companies have become trusted partners of Qatar and will continue to support the amazing development of the country in striving to achieve its National Vision 2030. the Ambassador stated.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Hans-Udo Muzel said: “Qatar has chosen the slogan ‘The path of excellence is difficult’ to reflects the past two years of the blockade which made life more arduous for each and every one on both sides of the rift, as families have been torn apart, business relations and cultural ties are being renounced. At the same time, Qatar has gained in strength, economically and socially, he added.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the blockade has had a positive catalyzing effect on the self-sufficiency of the Qatari economy, on achieving its National Vision 2030 and on the diversification of Qatar’s international relations, he affirmed. Thus, the very difficult experience of the blockade has made Qatar stronger, he said.</p>
      <p>“As we have learnt in German history, miracles in history are possible. When the Berlin Wall came down on 9th of November 1989 ending the Cold War in Europe and the world, everybody in Germany and all over the world was taken by surprise. My message to the Qatari people therefore is: Continue to hope for an end to the blockade and continue to offer dialogue in the spirit of mutual respect which the Qatari leadership has shown for the past two years,” H E the German Ambassador said.</p>
