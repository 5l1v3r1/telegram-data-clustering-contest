      <p>Miss South Africa has been crowned Miss Universe 2019, beating out more than 90 contestants for the title with an inspiring speech on the importance of teaching young women leadership.</p>
      <p>Zozibini Tunzi was up against Miss Puerto Rico, Madison Anderson, and Miss Mexico, Sofía Aragón, in the top three when she delivered one of the most memorable moments in the competition’s history.</p>
      <p>Asked what is the most important thing society should be teaching young girls today, Tunzi considered for a moment before making an impassioned and memorable speech in the new ‘final word’ segment.</p>

      <p>“I think the most important thing we should be teaching young girls today is leadership,” Tunzi said.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that has been lacking in young girls and women for a very long time, not because we don’t want to, but because of what society has labelled women to be.</p>
      <p>“I think we are the most powerful beings on the world, and that we should be given every opportunity and that is what we should be teaching these young girls, is to take up space.”</p>

      <p>With the end of her statement drowned out by rapturous applause, she concluded, “nothing is as important as taking up space in society and cementing yourself.”</p>
      <p>The activist against gender-based violence was crowned by last year’s winner Miss Philippines, Catriona Gray.</p>
      <p>While Miss Australia Priya Serrao failed to quality for the semi-finals, the Melbourne-based beauty thanked fans for their support and said she held the competition in great regard.</p>

      <p>“I have such an incredible appreciation for Miss Universe,” she said after Tunzi was crowned.</p>
      <p>“If you had asked me a year ago what my opinion beauty pageants were, I probably wouldn’t have had the best things to say.</p>
      <p>“But having been involved in it over the past year and having seen someone like Zozi (Zozibini Tunzi) win tonight has just made me incredibly, incredibly proud that I’m involved with Miss Universe as an organisation.”</p>
      <p>The Indian-born political advisor and law student made headlines earlier this year when she unveiled the national costume dress she would wear for the pageant, representing the iconic Australian frill necked lizard.</p>
