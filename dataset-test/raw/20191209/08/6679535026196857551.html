      <p>In a bizarre incident, the start of a Ranji Trophy match between Vidarbha and Andhra on Monday was delayed by a few minutes after a snake entered the ground here.</p>
      <p>Vidarbha captain Faiz Fazal won the toss and elected to field. However, as the players made their way to the middle, a snake was spotted on the field and it resulted in a delay of few minutes.</p>
      <p>“SNAKE STOPS PLAY! There was a visitor on the field to delay the start of the match,” BCCI Domestic tweeted a 13-second video.</p>
