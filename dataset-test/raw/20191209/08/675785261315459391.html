      <h1>Anthony Joshua sends warning to Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder after beating Andy Ruiz Jr</h1>
      <h2>Anthony Joshua is back on top of the heavyweight world and insists he wants to fight and beat Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder as soon as possible</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:29:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:29</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Joshua has warned Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury he is ready to fight - and has the tools to beat either man.</p>
      <p>Joshua recaptured his world heavyweight titles by beating Andy Ruiz Jr in their rematch in Saudi Arabia on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>There are now calls for him to take on the winner of Deontay Wilder's rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> in February as he aims to add the WBC crown to his collection.</p>
      <p>With an eye on unifying the division, Joshua told both unbeaten fighters they know where to find him and insisted he will not run.</p>
      <p>And he believes he now has all the tools to defeat either man inside the ring after coming back from the first defeat of his career.</p>

      <p>Asked on Good Morning Britain if he will face Fury or Wilder next, Joshua said: "I would love to make that my next fight.</p>
      <p>"I'm taking it one step at a time. Whenever they are ready, they know where to find me.</p>
      <p>"I'm not a running champion, I'm someone who will fight the best in the world.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> , Tyson Fury are those guys.</p>

      <p>"I would love to have the opportunity to either beat Deontay Wilder or beat Tyson Fury."</p>
      <p>Asked if he believes he would beat them should they meet in the ring, Joshua responded: "I definitely believe so.</p>
      <p>"I've displayed different styles of fighting. Sometimes inside fighting, sometimes knocked fighting, sometimes a boxing man's fight.</p>
      <p>"I believe I have their number, because I can display a variety of skills when it comes to boxing."</p>

      <p>Despite Joshua being keen to take on Fury or Wilder, a huge unification clash looks unlikely to be his next fight.</p>
      <p>His next bout appears likely to be against IBF mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev in a homecoming fight at the new Tottenham stadium in May.</p>
      <p>Promoter Eddie Hearn said: “Tottenham Hotspur is a nice new stadium for a UK fight and we’re having a look at that.</p>
      <p>“We have spoken to Spurs about doing it and they were very keen to host the Ruiz fight, but the dates did not work out.</p>
      <p>“They are very keen again and it would be a nice London stadium to do it in.”</p>
      <p>The WBO’s No 1 contender Oleksandr Usyk is also due a shot, although Hearn wants him to face Dereck Chisora first in either February or March.</p>
      <p>“We’ll speak to the governing bodies, see who wants to go first and take it from there,” said Hearn.</p>
