      <p>After India’s exit from the World Cup, there have been questions regarding Dhoni’s retirement, but the former captain has refused to divulge his future plans. His return to international cricket remains doubtful, but it’s certain that the wicketkeeper-batsman will be playing in the lucrative Indian Premier League for the next season. He will be leading Chennai Super Kings and has already begun his training for the tournament.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old was recently seen batting in the nets against Jharkhand U-23 bowlers and has also been training for an impactful return.</p>
