      <p>“It’s something that has been lacking in young girls and women for a very long time … because of what society has labeled women to be,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I think we are the most powerful beings in the world, and that we should be given every opportunity, and that is what we should be teaching these young girls, to take up space,” Tunzi continued.</p>
      <p>“Nothing is as important as taking up space in the society and cementing yourself.”</p>
