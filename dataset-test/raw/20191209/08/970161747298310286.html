      <h1>Motsi Mabuse understands Strictly curse - as she left husband for dance partner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:31:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:31</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Kelly</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> curse has plagued the BBC show since it began way back in 2004.</p>
      <p>And while many dismiss the curse’s existence, judge <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/motsi-mabuse/">Motsi Mabuse</a> admits she understands how it can happen – as she left her husband to marry her dance partner.</p>
      <p>The South African dancer, 38, married German dancer Timo Kulczak in 2003 when she was 22 years old, after they met four years before at the Blackpool Dance Festival.</p>
      <p>However, after 11 years together, Motsi fell for her dance partner Evgenij Voznyvk, with the judge saying: ‘Three years later whoosh! And then I was married.’</p>
      <p>After winning the German Latin American title in 2013, Motsi and Ukrainian Evgenij retired with a final rumba on the German version of Strictly – and it was then that Motsi knew she had feelings for her partner.</p>

      <p>She told The Sun: ‘We stopped and it was then that we realised that we wanted to do more than just dance together.’</p>
      <p>Motsi and Timo split, and in 2017, the star – whose sister is Strictly pro Oti Mabuse – married Evgenij in 2017.</p>
      <p>So Motsi has plenty of sympathy for those struck by the dreaded Strictly curse.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘You know, if you work in this sort of world, adult things happen. Everyone goes for a drink and, whoops-a-daisy!’</p>

      <p>Over the years, numerous couples have been formed on the BBC One show, with multiple celebrities leaving their partners for professional dancers, or splitting from their long-time loves after competing.</p>
      <p>Last year, Seann Walsh was dumped by his girlfriend of five years after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/08/not-a-set-up-strictlys-katya-jones-and-seann-walsh-getting-close-for-weeks-on-and-off-the-dancefloor-8017615/">he was pictured kissing partner Katya Jones</a> – who split from husband Neil months later.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/14/stacey-dooleys-ex-boyfriend-sam-tucknott-claims-dating-strictly-come-dancings-kevin-clifton-finding-secret-message-phone-9198768/">Stacey Dooley also split from boyfriend of three years Sam Tucknott</a> after winning the 2018 Glitterball, and is now dating her pro partner Kevin Clifton.</p>
      <p>Dianne Buswell split from actor Anthony Quinlan, only to start dating her celeb partner Joe Sugg, while Louise Redknapp’s 18-year marriage to Jamie ended after she competed on the 2016 series.</p>
      <p>Georgia May Foote broke up with Corrie co-star Sean Ward to date partner Giovanni Pernice; and shortly after competing on the show, Ben Cohen split from his wife of 11 years, Abby – going on to have a baby with his pro partner Kristina Rihanoff.</p>
      <p>And while it looks like the class of 2019 has escaped the dreaded curse, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/26/strictly-come-dancing-secret-romance-leaked-unlikely-new-couple-quickstepping-bedroom-11218993/">two members of the cast are believed to be having a secret romanc</a>e behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>This weekend will see Kelvin Fletcher, Karim Zeroual and Emma Barton fight to be crowned Strictly 2019 champion, after Chris Ramsey left the competition on Sunday night.</p>
