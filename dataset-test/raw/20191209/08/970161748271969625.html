      <h1>Nearly half of students want a voice assistant to help them study</h1>

      <p>Nearly half of students would like to be given access to a voice-activated assistant to help with their studies, new research suggests.</p>
      <p>The technology – now common in many smartphones and smart home speakers – is seen as a vital resource among those studying, with 70% of those asked claiming they would not be able to cope without an internet connection.</p>
      <p>The study, conducted by fibre broadband firm Glide, indicated that 48% of UK students asked said they would like access to a voice assistant to help with queries during their studies as a time-saving exercise, rather than having to go to a library or type out an internet search.</p>
      <p>A total of 88% of those asked also said the internet was their main source of information.</p>
      <p>In response to the findings, the study calls for greater consideration to be given to making purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) capable of handling hundreds of user devices trying to stream and connect simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Tom White, sales and marketing director at Glide, said: ‘Moving into purpose-built student accommodation is a lifestyle choice. Modern PBSA should not just deliver spaces to sleep in – they should be environments that inspire and enhance the lifestyle of the student.’</p>

      <p>‘With the rise of streaming, and the increase in the number of courses that rely on a high-speed internet connection, student accommodation providers need to ensure that accommodation can service the needs of its residents.’</p>
      <p>The research indicated that many students felt that introducing smart technology to shared accommodation could also help improve their feeling of safety and security during the first weeks of university, as well as more generally.</p>
      <p>The study said that 94% of those asked would like to see their room online before they arrive while 65% said a smart security system for their building would be useful.</p>
      <p>The issue of internet access has also been a topic during the on-going election campaign, with both the Conservative and Labour pledging to bring high-speed fibre broadband to every home and business in the country should either win the General Election.</p>
