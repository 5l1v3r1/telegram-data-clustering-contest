      <p>More domestic abuse incidents were recorded by the police in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Northern+Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> in the last year than in any 12-month period since statistics began.</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day last year 116 incidents were reported to police, compared to 84 the previous year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Police+Service+of+Northern+Ireland">Police Service of Northern Ireland</a> (PSNI) is to launch its Christmas Speak Out To Stop It campaign, which encourages victims of domestic violence to report it to police, on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>From October 1st, 2018 to September 30th, 2019 the PSNI recorded 31,817 domestic abuse incidents, an increase of 790 (or 2.5 per cent)compared to the previous 12 months.</p>
      <p>The figures are the highest since the PSNI started recording data in 2004/05.</p>
      <p>Between Christmas Day and December 27th, 2018, the police received 373 calls for help from victims of domestic violence.</p>

      <p>On New Year’s Day this year 158 incidents were reported.</p>
      <p>The head of the PSNI’s public protection branch, Det Chief Supt <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paula+Hilman">Paula Hilman</a>, said that while domestic abuse happens all year round, incidents do rise over the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>“The number of incidents of domestic abuse between 15th December and 16th January has risen steadily since 2014/15,” she said.</p>
      <p>“There were 2,704 incidents reported during this period in 2014/15, which has increased to 3,114 incidents for the same period in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>“Every 17 minutes, our officers respond to an incident of domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>“While this tells us more victims are finding the courage to pick up the phone and call us and make a report, which is encouraging, we must never forget that behind each statistic is a victim with a harrowing story of abuse.</p>
      <p>“I want to encourage all victims - regardless of age, race, gender or sexual orientation - to come forward and report what is happening to us. Speak out to stop it and we will help you. If you are a victim, you do not have to suffer in silence. You can come forward to report any incident of domestic abuse to us.”</p>
      <p>Det Chief Supt Hilman said anyone who is suffering from domestic abuse can contact police on the non-emergency 101 number or 999 in an emergency.</p>
      <p>“A 24-hour domestic and sexual abuse helpline is also available to anyone who has concerns about domestic or sexual abuse, now or in the past on 0808 802 1414.”</p>
