      <h1>What a grateful Whitley Bay couple are doing to say thanks for IVF on the NHS</h1>

      <p>For three years Frank Bailey and his partner Bianca Lockey have been trying for a baby as they dream of becoming parents.</p>
      <p>And now they have fresh hope after being given three rounds of IVF on the<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nhs"> NHS </a>to help them become a family.</p>
      <p>Realising the treatment will run into the thousands, grateful Frank is wanting to give something back and is shaving off his trademark beard as he raises funds for those who have helped him.</p>
      <p>And he has set his target at £3,500 for the Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Charity - the cost of one round of IVF.</p>

      <p>Hospital porter Frank, 39, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/whitley-bay">Whitley Bay</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside</a>, said: “We’ve been trying for a family for a few years now with no joy. Unfortunately this has not happened for us and we are now in touch with the Fertility Clinic at the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/centre-for-life">Centre For Life</a> in Newcastle and had loads of help and support from our local doctor’s surgery and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-general-hospital">North Tyneside General Hospital.</a></p>
      <p>“We have undergone lots of tests and examinations, more so Bianca, as many have before us.</p>
      <p>“We are now lucky enough to have been accepted for three rounds of IVF funded by the NHS. We are truly overwhelmed and elated. Now we would like to try and help raise some money to put something back in the pot for the fantastic work they do at the Centre For Life.”</p>
      <p>Frank and Bianca met 15 years ago in a bar in Whitley Bay and soon started living together. They moved from their flat into a three bedroom house eight years ago and planned to have children in the future after renovating the property.</p>
      <p>But when they started to try for a baby Bianca was finding it difficult to conceive.</p>

      <p>“A scan showed that I had polycystic ovaries which were reducing the chances of me conceiving naturally,” said Bianca, 33, a secretary at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/royal-victoria-infirmary-newcastle">Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.</a></p>
      <p>“We were referred to the Centre For Life and they checked to make sure there wasn’t any blockages in my tubes and they were fine.</p>
      <p>“We have been given three rounds of IVF on the NHS which is fantastic. I have had the first round on a low cycle but the follicles didn’t respond as they should, so I get my next round in the New Year on a higher dosage of medication.</p>

      <p>“It would mean the world to me to have a baby. It’s something I’ve wanted for years but we put it on hold as we worked on the house. Then when we did start to try I found out I had polycystic ovaries which can’t be removed.</p>
      <p>“It is hurtful to see lots of people walking around with children and it would mean so much for us to become a family. Having IVF is something that isn’t discussed a lot but it has really helped us by talking about it.</p>
      <p>“They put one embryo in on the first two rounds of IVF and then two on the last round, I would be over the moon with one child but if there were two we would have a ready made family.</p>
      <p>“We want to give something back to the NHS and Frank got the idea of shaving off his beard.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got so used to him with it that it will be strange when he doesn’t have it any more.</p>
      <p>“He’s absolutely amazing and has been so supportive. The money he’ll raise will pay for a round of IVF for someone else.”</p>
      <p>Frank added: “I’ve had the beard for over a year now and it’s about 6 inches long. It’s had a few trims over that time but nothing special, but it is for a worthy cause why it’s coming off.”</p>
      <p>Frank gets his beard shaved off on December 13 at The Original Turkish Barber in Park View, Whitley Bay.</p>
