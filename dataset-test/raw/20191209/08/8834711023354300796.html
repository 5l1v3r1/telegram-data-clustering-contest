      <p>CAPE TOWN – Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu’s family is hoping he’ll be discharged from the hospital this week.</p>
      <p>The struggle icon was hospitalised at a Cape Town hospital last week for a recurring infection.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said his family hoped to have him home this week.</p>
      <p>The 88-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has been in and out of hospital over the past few years for a similar infection.</p>
      <p>The Tutu family has expressed enormous gratitude to all who have sent their love and prayers.</p>
      <p>Archbishop Thabo Makgoba last week visited Tutu in hospital and said he found him “lucid” and “engaging”.</p>
