      <p>Finland's left-wing Social Democrats, who lead a five-party coalition government, have picked 34-year-old Minister of Transport and Communications Sanna Marin to become the country's youngest-ever prime minister next week, taking over after the resignation of Antti Rinne.</p>
      <p>Rinne <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/finlands-prime-minister-resigns-postal-service-dispute-191203134117243.html">resigned</a> earlier this week after coalition member the Centre Party said it had lost confidence in him following his handling of a postal strike.</p>

      <p>"We have a lot of work ahead to rebuild trust," Marin told reporters after winning a narrow vote among the party leadership.</p>
      <p>Antti Lindtman, head of the party's parliamentary group, was runner-up.</p>
      <p>"We have a joint government programme which glues the coalition together," Marin said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/new-zealand.html">New Zealand</a> Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is 39, Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk is 35, while North Korea's leader, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/kim-jong.html">Kim Jong Un</a> is reportedly 35.</p>
      <p>Marin will head Finland's women-led coalition, which includes Left Alliance's Li Anderson, 32; the Green League's Maria Ohisalo, 34; the Centre Party's Katri Kulmuni, 32 and Anna-Maja Henriksson, the 55-year-old leader of the Swedish People's party.</p>
      <p>According to the Guinness World Records, Malaysia's Mahathir bin Mohamad, now 94, is the oldest sitting prime minister.</p>
      <p>The coalition, which took office just six months ago, has agreed to continue with its programme after Rinne announced he was stepping down at the demand of the Centre Party.</p>
      <p>The timing of the change in leadership is awkward for Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> until the end of the year, playing a central role in efforts to hammer out a new budget for the bloc.</p>
