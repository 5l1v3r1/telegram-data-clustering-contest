      <p>A CORRESPONDENT</p>
      <p><b>LAKHIMPUR:</b> The Lakhimpur district council of the Communist Party of India (CPI) once again came down heavily against the BJP-led Union and State governments for their alleged adamant attitude to pass the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) in the Parliament.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the party on Sunday severely criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah with regard to their unmoved attitude to pass the Bill in the ongoing session of the Parliament by ignoring the sentiments of the people and agitation programmes initiated by multiple organizations. Simultaneously, the leaders of the party also criticized Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for his support to the Bill.</p>
      <p> Regarding the issue, the Lakhimpur district councils of CPI, All India Youth Federation (AIYF), All Assam Nirman Shramik Santha (AITUC) and Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA) organized a public protest meeting on Sunday at their district office premises in North Lakhimpur town. The meeting commenced with prominent social activist Uday Sankar Hazarika in the chair. Speaking against the CAB, leaders of the CPI and the other organizations, Girindra Prashad Upadhyay, Subheswar Phukan, Sarbajit Prashad emphasized initiating united agitation against CAB. The party opined that the people of the State must come forward against CAB to save the State and the community from the burden of foreigners. They alleged that the BJP-led governments at the Centre and the State were diverting the people’s attention from developmental issues by sponsoring new tricks. They flayed the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister regarding their U-turn from their pre-poll commitments of ensuring foreigner-free nation and State after assuming charge and their present contradictory stand. Assam Pradesh Congress Committee member Jyoti Gogoi, social activist Mamoni Bhattacharya, and journalist Sailen Baruah also extended their views in the event.</p>
      <p>In the same programme, recipient of Bharat Jyoti Award, 2019, eminent lawyer, social activist and secretary of Lakhimpur District Council of CPI, Arup Kalita was given warm felicitation by the party, Lakhimpur district councils of All India Youth Federation, Indian People’s Theatre Association, Nikhil Bharat Krishak Sabha, Mahila Sangha and by the representative of Dhemaji Foreigners Tribunal. Receiving the felicitation, Arup Kalita declared that he had dedicated the award in the name of his father Kanuram Kalita, father-in-law and noted litterateur Dr. Chandradhar Chamuah and the deprived, downtrodden people of the society. He also spoke against CAB and demanded the immediate scrapping of the Bill.</p>
