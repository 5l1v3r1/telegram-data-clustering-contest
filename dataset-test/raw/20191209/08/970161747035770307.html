      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> broke down in tears as she was reunited with her two little girls after her I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here win.</p>
      <p>The ex-EastEnders star was left in shock when she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/im-celebrity-2019-jacqueline-jossa-crowned-winner-emotional-finale-11412652/">crowned Queen of the Jungle</a> on Sunday night’s live show, beating out Corrie’s Andy Whyment and DJ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> in a final public vote.</p>
      <p>But the mum-of-two had been missing daughters Ella, four, and one-year-old Mia since entering the jungle… and so when they reunited it was inevitable there were tears.</p>
      <p>Entering the Versace Palazzo hotel as she returned to normality, Jacqueline was greeted to a crowd of well-wishers and loved ones – but only had eyes for her two little ones.</p>
      <p>Scooping them up in her arms, Jacqueline broke down in tears as she finally had her family back together again.</p>
      <p>Her two girls were also clearly delighted to be back with their mum and were seen giving her a big hug and cheering her on.</p>
      <p>It seems the pair are as bubbly and positive as their mum, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/dan-osborne-admits-smiling-hasnt-always-possible-amid-cheating-claims-jacqueline-jossa-heads-im-celebrity-finale-11412483/">Dan even thanking them for ‘helping him keep smiling’</a> amid allegations he cheated on Jacqueline.</p>

      <p>‘Thank you my babies for putting a smile on daddy’s face every single day even on the days that smiling just doesn’t seem possible,’ he wrote in an emotional post.</p>
      <p>‘You are all incredible and my world!! Now let’s go get mummy back!!!!’</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway later told GMB abou the moment: ‘There’s a lovely moment you see, where she walks into the Palazzo, and she walks in and sees her two little girls, and it’s so lovely, you’re going to really enjoy seeing it.’</p>
      <p>Her husband, Dan Osborne, ignored allegations of infidelity for an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/im-celebrity-2019-jacqueline-jossa-crowned-winner-emotional-finale-11412652/">emotional reunion on the I’m A Celebrity bridge</a>, joining Jacqueline’s mum and dad who were also there to see her victory.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/dan-osborne-jacqueline-jossa-cosy-im-celebrity-jungle-win-11413591/">pair have been loved up ever since</a> and stuck by each other’s side.</p>

      <p>Talking to Ant and Dec after her win, Jacqueline said: ‘I can’t believe I did all that stuff. It was not what I expected, it was a lot harder than I expected. But also I just didn’t think it was going to be such a turning point in life.</p>
      <p>‘I went in and was one person and I feel like I’ve come out as a different person.’</p>
      <p>‘I feel like I’ve grown in confidence and found who I am as a person a little bit more,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>Bursting into tears as she won, she said: ‘Thank you so much for voting for me, I love my family so much, I love Daniel, I love my kids, I love my mum and dad, my best friends…’</p>
