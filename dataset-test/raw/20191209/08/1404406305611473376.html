      <p>Since everyone was posting their year-end steaming numbers, we decided to post ours as well. 2019 was a huge year for VladTV, with a 50% increase in YouTube views from 2018. Our incredible staff put out 6 new clips every day (including weekends and holidays) as well as a daily flashback and full interviews. Thank you to our loyal viewers, our guests, all the media outlets and social media accounts that posted our videos, and all the VladTV haters that have us all that free promo 😂. As we go into our 12th year of business, we will continue to bring you great new content every day in 2020 and beyond. 🙏</p>
      <p>Stay tuned as we release our biggest interviews of 2019 later today.</p>
