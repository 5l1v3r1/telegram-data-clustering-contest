      <p>"My nephew was diabetic and probably that might have led to his death but, of course, [when] the official autopsy report [is out] we will be able to know what happened," Wamalwa as quoted by the <i>Nation</i>.</p>
      <p>Robert further addressed reports on social media that William had passed due to <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/30614-eric-omondis-brother-joseph-onyango-dead">depression, alcoholism and drug abuse.</a></p>
      <p>"It is far from the truth. It really very unfair and people should not capitalise on something like that. They should have a sense of decorum and respect to the family and the dead," he conveyed.</p>
      <p>William was a second-year student at the University of Nairobi at the time of his death.</p>
