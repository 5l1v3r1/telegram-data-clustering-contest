      <p>Doha: The Chairman and Managing Director of Qatar Postal Services Company Faleh Mohammed Al Nuaimi, said that the celebration of the National Day has significant meanings in the minds and hearts of all citizens and residents of the State of Qatar.</p>
      <p>Al Nuaimi said, in a statement to Qatar News Agency (QNA), that this cherished occasion celebrates the anniversary of the founding of the beloved State of Qatar that grew up and became a lighthouse of civilization and a leading model to be emulated in all fields of life.</p>
      <p>Al Nuaimi added that attention to the human being has always been the supreme goal and the focus of Qatars policies and development plans, being the main factor and the engine of development processes and renaissance.</p>
      <p>Al Nuaimi pointed out that the celebration of the National Day is an expression of the fulfillment of the values established by the Founder Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed bin Thani, and a sincere affirmation to proceed on his approach, and the principles he formulated.</p>
      <p>Al Nuaimi said that today, we are witnessing a true embodiment of these values and principles, namely the development and prosperity of the homeland, social cohesion and unity around our wise leadership.</p>
      <p>On the progress of the country in various fields, and the strengthening of Qatarâ€™s global presence despite the challenges, especially the unjust blockade, Al Nuaimi said that after two years of blockade on Qatar, the state was able to achieve tangible achievements in record time as a result of sound planning, and a tight strategy that integrated all the influential sectors in the country with the full support of the wise leadership.</p>
      <p>He added that Qatar has lived for two years of steadfastness and achievement, after moving on several political, economic and media axes, through which it succeeded in absorbing the shock, and getting out of the crisis stronger than it was before the blockade. He pointed out that the country has also managed to establish solid international relations with many countries of the world and strong partnerships and economic and investment relations with many advanced economies.</p>
