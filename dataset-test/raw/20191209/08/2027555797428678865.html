      <h1>Injuries feared as popular New Zealand volcano erupts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:50:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Around 100 people were near New Zealand's White Island volcano when it erupted suddenly on Monday, leaving authorities scrambling to treat the injured and find those unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the volcanic island -- also known as Whakaari -- off New Zealand's north coast had erupted while groups of tourists were visiting.</p>
      <p>"It is very much an evolving situation and of course all our thoughts are with those affected," she told reporters in Wellington, adding that an undetermined number of people were unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>Whakatane mayor Judy Turner told AFP "there have been people injured" and rescue missions were under way.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how many or the state of their injuries but emergency services are currently frantically trying to get these people back from the island to hospital for treatment," she said.</p>
      <p>St John Ambulance said there were up to 20 people believed injured but medical teams were still en route.</p>
      <p>The country's National Emergency Management Agency described the eruption as "moderate", although a thick plume of white ash could be seen for miles around.</p>
      <p>Several helicopters and aircraft could be seen in the area.</p>
      <p>The island is about 50 kilometres (30 miles) offshore in the picturesque Bay of Plenty and is popular with adventurous tourists willing to don hard hats and gas masks.</p>
      <p>There were particular fears for a group of visitors seen walking on the crater floor moments before the eruption occurred.</p>
      <p>Cameras providing a live feed from the volcano showed more than half a dozen people inside the rim at 2:10 pm local time (0110 GMT), before images went dark when the eruption occurred minutes later.</p>
      <p>Police said they were responding to the incident, but offered no further comment.</p>
      <p>White Island is New Zealand's most active volcano cone and about 70 percent of it is undersea, according to government agency GeoNet.</p>
      <p>Around 10,000 people visit the volcano every year. It has erupted frequently over the last half-century, most recently in 2016.</p>
      <p>In August of that year the New Zealand Defence Force airlifted a 2.4-tonne shipping container onto the island to serve as an emergency shelter in case of an eruption.</p>
