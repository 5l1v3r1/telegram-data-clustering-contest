      <h1>New Wonder Woman 1984 trailer is deliciously 80s</h1>

      <h3>The savior of the DC Cinematic Universe returns.</h3>
      <p>The first proper <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/wonder-woman-1984/">Wonder Woman 1984</a> </i>trailer has dropped, and it’s a good’un.</p>
      <p>The trailer, below, debuted today at CCXP Brazil. In it, you’ll get great glimpses of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Chris Pine as (surprise!) a returned-from-the-dead (?) Steve Trevor and a look at Kristen Wiig pre-Cheetah as Barbara Minerva.</p>
      <p>As you’ll also be able to see (and hear), there’s a huge 80s vibe going down… and is that the same mall from <i>Stranger Things</i> or do they all seriously just look the same?</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/wonder-woman-1984/">Wonder Woman 1984</a> </i>heads to theatres in the northern hemisphere summer of 2020 (so winter here in Australia).</p>
