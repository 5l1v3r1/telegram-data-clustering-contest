      <h1>Ghostbusters: Afterlife's First Trailer Ain't Afraid of Leaning into Legacy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:12:45+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:12</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Gerding</a></address>
      <p>The Ghostbusters franchise rises from the dead once again with the release of the first teaser trailer for the third film in the franchise - <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/ghostbusters-3/">Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a>.</p>
      <p>Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard and more join the Ghostbusters family in the teaser, which hints at the film's plot, without giving too much story away (aside from Wolfhard apparently playing Egon's grandson). What is clear is that the film, which takes place in the same universe as the original movies rather than the reality introduced by the ill-received reboot in 2015, follows in its predecessors' footsteps, merging humor, action and the supernatural.</p>
