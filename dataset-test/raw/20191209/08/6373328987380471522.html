        <b>One of the last surviving pilots from the Battle of Britain has died aged 101. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Following the passing of Flt Lt Maurice ­Mounsdon, the number of heroes left who fought in the historic air battles between the UK’s Royal Air Force and Nazi Germany’s Luftwaffe has been reduced to just three.</p>
      <p>Maurice, with 56 Squadron, was one of 3,000 men who risked their lives in a three-and-a-half month campaign, in which 544 RAF pilots and aircrew died.</p>

      <p>At the age of 22, Maurice had already shot down four enemy aircraft in a number of dogfights.</p>
      <p>While soaring across Colchester, the veteran recalled the moment he was hit by a cannon shell from a Messerschmitt 109. Even with horrendous burns to his arms and legs, the pilot was able flip the plane and escape.</p>

        <b>Explaining the incident, Maurice said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I was on fire. There was only one thing to do and that was to get out as fast as possible. I was badly burned, but I rolled the aircraft over and came down by ­parachute from 14,000ft. I was conscious all the time. It was the first time I’d used a parachute. I think I was jolly lucky, in a way.<br/><br/>The dogfights were pretty frightening. Everyone was firing at the same time. It was a matter of luck if you survived or not… but at the end of it all it was the happiest time of my life, though I lost a lot of good friends.</blockquote>
      <p>His nephew Adrian told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/one-last-battle-britain-pilots-21052992"><i>Daily Mirror</i></a>: ‘He was a great man and will be missed by his nephews and nieces.’</p>
      <p>While being treated by pioneering surgeon Archibald McIndoe following the plane escape, Maurice – originally from Lichfield, Staffs – met his future wife Mary at the hospital. He married her in 1941 and spent the rest of World War II as a flight instructor.</p>

      <p>In the late 1970s, the couple (who never had ­children) moved to the Spanish island of Menorca. Mary died in 1993 and Maurice passed away on Friday, December 6.</p>
      <p>In September last year, the veteran celebrated his 100th birthday in style in Menorca, watching the Red Arrows’ smoke trails write ‘100’ in red, blue and white over the Mediterranean in a dazzling 30-minute performance.</p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>It was a real honour for me for the Red Arrows to come to Menorca and put on this display.</blockquote>
      <p>RIP Flt Lt Maurice ­Mounsdon.</p>
