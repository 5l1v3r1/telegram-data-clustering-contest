      <p>Shocked diners at the Arbroath fast food outlet watched 55-year-old Anthony Tizzard struggle to get into his car during a Saturday lunchtime incident in March.</p>
      <p>He careered away from the Westway premises and was eventually found pushing his damaged car in the town after coming to grief on the central reservation of the road nearby.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Jill Drummond told Forfar Sheriff Court customers saw Tizzard behaving in an “erratic manner” at the restaurant around 12.40pm.</p>
      <p>“He was uneasy on his feet and appeared to have a nose bleed,” said the fiscal.</p>
      <p>“They then saw him attempting to get into his vehicle but he struggled to do that and dropped his food.</p>
      <p>“The accused pulled out in front of another driver and accelerated excessively onto Westway before veering across the road and hitting the central reservation, causing his vehicle to become airborne and leak fluid all over the road,” added Ms Drummond.</p>
      <p>Tizzard’s driving led other motorists to call 999 and police found him in Arbroath’s Keptie Street, pushing the damaged car with another man.</p>
      <p>“He was heard to state that he had done ‘mirror, signal, manoeuvre’ before smashing into a bollard,” said the fiscal.</p>
      <p>Tizzard, of William Phillips Drive, Montrose provided a negative roadside breath test but admitted driving carelessly in various Arbroath streets on March 30 while unfit through drink or drugs, at excessive speed and striking the central reservation.</p>
      <p>His solicitor, Billy Rennie said the accused was working with local agencies to tackle his difficulties.</p>
      <p>“He has the support he needs,” said Mr Rennie.</p>
      <p>“He has been subject to an interim disqualification and has limited road traffic offending.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Derek Reekie told Tizzard: “This is highly dangerous activity and it is plain you were in no fit state to be on the roads at all.</p>
      <p>“You were extremely fortunate no injuries were caused to other road users or yourself but the potential was very significant indeed.</p>
      <p>“The main priority is protection of the public and it seems a lengthy period of disqualification is required,” said the sheriff.</p>
      <p>In addition to the 21-month ban, Tizzard was also fined £450.</p>
