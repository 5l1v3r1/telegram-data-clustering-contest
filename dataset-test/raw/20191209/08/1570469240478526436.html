      <p>An Iraqi paramilitary leader and a politician have laughed off financial sanctions Washington recently placed on them for alleged corruption and human rights abuses. </p>
      <p>"They should have given us this honour a long time ago," said Qais al-Khazali, one of the newly-sanctioned figures, in sardonic remarks to an audience of supporters on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Khazali heads Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a pro-Iran armed faction that makes up part of the broader Hashed al-Shaabi security force tied to the Iraqi state. </p>
      <p>The US Treasury on Friday accused his group of "widespread forced disappearances, abductions, killings, and torture" under the Global Magnitsky act.</p>
      <p>The measures block financial transactions with and travel to the US for people who commit human rights abuses or corruption.</p>
      <p>"I'm embarrassed. Designate me a terrorist! A global terrorist. What is this Treasury list?" Khazali said.</p>
      <p>"That means the money we have in US banks will go," he added sarcastically. </p>
      <p>The US also sanctioned Iraqi businessman and political figure Khamees al-Khanjar, whom it accused of bribery.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Khanjar's party condemned the decision and said the accusations were "extremely funny and illogical."</p>
      <p>"He was never an official, nor was his party part of the government," invalidating the corruption allegation, it said.</p>
      <p>Khanjar is an influential Sunni powerbroker with close ties across Iraq's leading political parties. </p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from two other paramilitary figures sanctioned on Friday: Laith al-Khazali, Qais's brother and also a member of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, and Abu Zeinab al-Lami, who heads the Hashed's security apparatus.</p>
      <p>This is the second batch of Iraqi nationals the US has sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky act.</p>
