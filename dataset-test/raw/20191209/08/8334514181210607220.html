      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he would try to find a way to honor his promise to oppose Heathrow airport expansion by lying down in front of bulldozers but that it might be difficult for him.</p>
      <p>The British parliament has approved an expansion plan for Heathrow, including building the first full-length new runway in the London area for 70 years, but the plans are being challenged in the courts.</p>
      <p>Before he won the top job, Johnson opposed Heathrow expansion and promised to lie down before bulldozers to stop it.</p>
      <p>“On Heathrow, it’s a private sector project which is still to satisfy its strict legal obligations on air quality and noise pollution,” Johnson told LBC radio.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see much sign of any bulldozers yet... I would have to find some way of honoring that promise. It might be technically difficult to achieve... Let’s wait and see when the bulldozers arrive.”</p>
      <p>Asked about a HS2, a proposed high-speed rail project to improve links from London to central and northern England, Johnson said the cost would be more than 100 billion pounds ($128 billion).</p>
