      <p>Bidding opened online for the 200 lots last month, and about £40,000 had already been pledged before the phone lines opened on Sunday.</p>
      <p>During the live auction on Channel 103, which was hosted by Fiona Walker and breakfast show presenter Peter Mac, Islanders bid for a range of lots, including personal training sessions and gym membership, food and drink hampers and tours of the Royal Court and air traffic control centre.</p>
      <p>One of the star lots – a trip to the Monaco Grand Prix – went for £6,575, while a weekend at the Minquiers fetched £1,250. Another lot which attracted much interest was a pair of tickets for the Wimbledon ladies final, which went for £5,500.</p>
      <p>Islanders also had the opportunity to ‘pledge a wedge’ in order to have a chance of winning an exotic holiday. Every £10 pledge secured one entry to the draw, with the value of the trip increasing all the time and ending up as a holiday to Toronto and Manhattan.</p>
      <p>A total of £60,819 was raised by the auction.</p>
      <p>The Jersey Christmas Appeal was started by the Jersey Evening Post in 1897. It was originally known as the Christmas Dinner Fund and in its first year raised £26 18s 9d.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the Charity Auction raised just over £50,000, plus another £10,000 from the ‘pledge a wedge’ initiative and £10,000 from a private donor to make an overall total of £70,293.</p>
