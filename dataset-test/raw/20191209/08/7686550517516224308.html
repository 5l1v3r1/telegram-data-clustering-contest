      <h2>There are thousands of free movies and TV shows to watch</h2>

      <p>A new on-demand streaming service for movies and TV shows has launched in the UK and unlike rivals such as Netflix or Amazon Prime - the platform is free.</p>
      <p>Plex is offering thousands of films, TV shows and web series to stream without charge - including titles such as Zulu, Rain Man, Raging Bull, Lord of War, The Terminator, Apocalypse Now and Thelma and Louise.</p>
      <p>Plex says it will continue to add new content on top of its current library of thousands of Hollywood blockbusters, TV shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, Bollywood musicals and more, reports <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/1214032/Sky-TV-Netflix-vs-Plex-Free-To-Watch-Streaming-Service">The Express</a> .</p>
      <p>Plex has teamed up with Warner Bros to offer the service - which includes adverts - and has just launched.</p>
      <p>All you need to view any of the content is a Plex account, which is free to set-up.</p>
      <p>Plexâ€™s library includes content from the major Hollywood studios, including MGM, Lionsgate, Legendary and Warner Bros.</p>
      <p>Until now, Plex had been a media library service designed to help you keep your own video content organised and available to stream on any of your devices.</p>
      <p>Plex CEO Keith Valory, said: "Plex was born out of a passion for media and entertainment, and offering free ad-supported premium movies and TV shows is just the latest step in our mission to bring all your favorite content together in one place.</p>
      <p>"What started more than a decade ago as a passion project to make accessing media on connected devices easier has evolved into the most comprehensive streaming platform in the industry, used by millions of people around the world."</p>
      <p>Plex is available to download for free on iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Android TV, Fire TV, macOS, Windows and other platforms</p>
