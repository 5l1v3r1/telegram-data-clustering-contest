        <b>Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson was 37 weeks pregnant when a woman approached her in Cardiff.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"This woman stopped me and said: 'How did you get pregnant?'" Grey-Thompson recalled.</p>
      <p>"I remember screaming at her in the street: 'I had sex. How do you think I got pregnant?'</p>
      <p>"She was like: 'Oh, that's disgusting.' And I said: 'I think he's quite good looking, actually.'"</p>
      <p>Grey-Thompson was a nine-time Paralympic gold medallist when she became pregnant with her daughter Carys in 2001, but later won two more gold medals.</p>
      <p>People struggled to understand how her body would adapt - and they were not afraid to tell her so.</p>
      <p>"I lost count of the number of people who asked me how I got pregnant," the 50-year-old told the Stumps, Wheels and Wobblies podcast.</p>
      <p>"The first thing I was offered at my first scan was a termination because people were like: 'You should not have children.'"</p>

      <h3>'Fear that we might breed'</h3>
      <p>Grey-Thompson has <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spina-bifida/">spina bifida</a>, a condition caused when a baby's spine and spinal cord does not develop properly in the womb.</p>
      <p>"We had a discussion [with the medical staff] about if I was trying for babies and that individual had some quite complicated views on disability - [an attitude of] we might breed," Grey-Thompson said.</p>
      <p>"I had to answer lots of questions about what you do if it's disabled.</p>
      <p>"I said I would make sure they have a really cool chair, not like the horrible chair I had until I was 15!"</p>
      <p>One in every 1,000 pregnancies is affected by a spine or brain defect.</p>
      <p>Doctors at King's College Hospital carried out groundbreaking keyhole surgery to repair a baby's spine in the womb earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Grey-Thompson has previously spoken about terminating a disabled baby, adding that her parents would <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-48317419">"probably have ended the pregnancy"</a> had they known about her disability.</p>

      <h3>'Not every disabled person is inspirational'</h3>
      <p>The term 'inspiration porn' was coined in 2012 to describe the portrayal of people with disabilities as inspirational solely, or in part, on the basis of their disability.</p>
      <p>Paralympian and BBC podcaster Hannah Dines <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/disability-sport/50632590">has said</a> that labelling athletes as "inspirational" can be insulting, and Grey-Thompson agrees.</p>
      <p>"It is almost like you have to have had something dramatic or traumatic happen to you to justify your position as a disabled athlete," she added.</p>
      <p>"There are lots of athletes on the programme who have been through war and lost limbs in really horrible ways.</p>
      <p>"I really struggle if that back story is part of the sports coverage because that does send out a message that you have to be inspirational and not every disabled person is inspirational.</p>
      <p>"I don't wake up every day and say: 'Today I'm going to be inspirational.'"</p>
