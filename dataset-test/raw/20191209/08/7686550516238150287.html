      <h1>Christians call for offensive Christmas cards to be banned</h1>
      <h2>“It is just another sad example of the kind of under the radar discrimination Christians around Europe and currently facing.”</h2>

      <p>Furious Christians have branded a new range of "humorous" Christmas cards featuring Mary, Joseph and the Baby Jesus "deeply offensive."</p>
      <p>They say the cards "highlight a fundamental hypocrisy" that Christianity is seen as "fair game to mock, disparage and insult."</p>
      <p>One of the cards, produced by Yorkshire-based gift firm Love Layla, includes the wording "Mary just needs to admit she slept with someone else."</p>
      <p>The ‘C’mon Mary’ card also features a cartoon depiction of the nativity scene with Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.</p>
      <p>It is part of a new range of "humorous and edgy" Christmas cards.</p>
      <p>Others in the range include ‘Jesus was born to save ***** like you’, ‘Hands up if it’s your birthday’ featuring Jesus holding his arms aloft and, ‘I am sorry that your December birthday is overshadowed by a bloke that wore socks with sandals’ featuring an apologetic cartoon Christ.</p>
      <p>There’s even an interactive ‘scratch’ greeting card posing the question ‘Who did Mary really sleep with?’ providing three foil panels to scratch off.</p>
      <p>But the cards have attracted a backlash from Christians on social media. Some have even called for the cards to be removed from sale.</p>
      <p>James Mildred, communication Manager of Christian Action Research and Education (CARE), said: “A lot of Christians will be deeply offended by this sort of thing.</p>
      <p>“It highlights a fundamental hypocrisy that Christianity is seen as fair game to mock, disparage and insult.</p>
      <p>“As Christians we believe it is vital to exercise respect when sharing our views and listening to what others think.</p>
      <p>“This card is the opposite of respectful."</p>
      <p>Mr Mildred added: “Sadly, this happens every Christmas, which is such an important time in the Christian calendar.</p>
      <p>“It is just another sad example of the kind of under the radar discrimination Christians around Europe and currently facing.”</p>
      <p>Love Layla’s cards and gifts are no stranger to controversy. Its alternative "thank you teacher range" caused fury among teaching unions who branded the range as disrespectful to the profession.</p>
      <p>Stacey Dennis, who founded Love Layla four years ago, started out printing her cheeky designs in her bedroom after being made redundant as a graphic designer.</p>
      <p>Now Love Layla has turned into a multi-million-pound business, with a warehouse operation in West Yorkshire and a business in Australia.</p>
      <p>Fans of the brand include Dragon's Den businessmen Theo Paphitis and several stars of reality TV show Geordie Shore.</p>
      <p>Stacey said: "We've really pulled out all the stops for this year’s Christmas range as this is what our customers want with some designs providing much more of a playful edge.</p>
      <p>"And with the way this year has panned out, people are in real need of a laugh and a giggle.</p>
      <p>"Christmas isn’t just about religion it’s also about having fun and enjoying ourselves.</p>
      <p>“We’re just trying to be original and funny by catering for all different types of humour, we don’t set out to deliberately upset anyone."</p>
      <p>She added: "People just need to take it in the light-hearted spirit that is intended.</p>
      <p>"If they want a more traditional Christmas card or something more mainstream then they shouldn’t be looking at our range.</p>
      <p>"There’s plenty of choices available out there for those who believe Christmas and comedy don’t mix.”</p>
