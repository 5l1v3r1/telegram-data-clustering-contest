      <h2>A divide over Arbroath active travel proposals to transform the town-splitting A92 dual carriageway has seen a bid to halt the multi-million pound scheme blocked.</h2>

        <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/angus-mearns/946802/revealed-7m-scheme-to-re-unite-split-angus-town-for-cyclists-drivers-and-walkers/">Alongside Perth, the town was a big winner in a July Sustrans funding announcement, bagging almost £7m for a scheme to improve pedestrian and cycle links with the aim of rejoining the two sides of Arbroath separated by the key road.</a>
      </p>
      <p>But as councillors considered the timetable for the ambitious scheme, long-serving town representative Alex King said the project would cost the authority millions of pounds it does not have.</p>

      <p>Supports of the scheme accused the Arbroath West and Letham SNP member of lacking vision over the “once-in-a-lifetime” concept.</p>
      <p>In a full council information report, finance chiefs said they expect the authority’s contribution to the final project to be “significantly less” than a £5.4  million shortfall for the £13.2m total cost.</p>
      <p>Funding requirements will have to be factored into the 2020 council budget and two-year construction works are due to commence in 2021.</p>
      <p>Mr King said: “All of the people I have spoken to are totally opposed to it.</p>
      <p>“At the community council there has been nothing but a hostile reaction.</p>
      <p>“This is money that we should not have applied for because we are going to have to find other money for this to go ahead.”</p>
      <p>Mr King was told that because the item was an information report only there was no procedure available to force a vote on it.</p>

      <p>Arbroath Independent Lois Speed said: “I’m not sure how representative your comments are of the 20-odd thousand people in Arbroath and the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>“I have spoken to lots of constituents who are supportive and excited about winning this funding.</p>
      <p>“This whole idea of the A92 severing the town came through public participation and a public voice, it wasn’t a council idea.</p>
      <p>“I think this project is visionary and it is a once-in-a-lifetime idea.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate we already have financial challenges and there will be a shortfall in funding that may have to be found, but we have to be ambitious and strive to create a sustainable environment for generations to come,” she said.</p>
      <p>Town Conservative councillor Derek Wann said: “We’re only speaking about four or five voices at community council that have been critical and there is still some way to go before coming up with full and final plans.</p>
      <p>Council leader and Arbroath Independent David Fairweather said: “A lot of people have got into their heads that the plans put forward are the finished article – they are not.</p>
      <p>“This is the time we should be looking to have a vision for the future of Arbroath.”</p>
