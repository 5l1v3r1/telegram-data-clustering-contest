      <p>A new game, dubbed "I Am Jesus Christ", which lets you play as the Saviour, was announced on the Steam service, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201912011077455072-gods-message-in-babylonian-flood-story-could-be-earliest-example-of-fake-news-researcher-claims/">sparking controversy among believers.</a> The trailer shows the first-person view of Christ miraculously healing a blind woman, creating fish from nothing, walking on water, and even features a scene of the crucifixion.</p>
      <blockquote>"Become Jesus Christ, the famous man on Earth - in this highly realistic simulation game. Pray like Him for getting superpower, perform famous miracles like Him from Bible like casting demons, healing and feeding people, resurrection and more in I Am Jesus Christ", the description says.</blockquote>

      <p>At the moment, no precise release date has been set.</p>
      <p>While the developers offer users to "save the world as He did", the game has drawn negative comments as well. Some noted that this was a step too far and even called it "blasphemous".</p>
