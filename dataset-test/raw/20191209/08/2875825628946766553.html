      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: I'm A Celebrity 2019 winner Jacqueline Jossa will skip all live TV interviews amid denied rumours surrounding husband Dan Osborne</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:28:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:28</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa appears to be the first I'm A Celebrity winner to skip live TV interviews, in the wake of her win on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actress, who played Lauren Branning on the BBC soap, broke down as she was crowned Queen of the Jungle on the ITV series by hosts Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>She beat runner-up Andy Whyment to be crowned champion, before being met by husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> in a sweet reunion on the famous bridge.</p>
      <p>But it's now confirmed that viewers will not get to see the actress speak out over her win on live TV on Monday.</p>
      <p>The winners tend to appear on an ITV daytime show the day after the final.</p>

      <p>A source close to Jacqueline has told Mirror Online that she has chosen to spend time with her kids, with her also busy filming for ITV.</p>
      <p>They said: "She has to film for the 'coming out' show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family.</p>
      <p>"Jacqueline and Dan spent time together in the hotel and probably had a lot to talk about."</p>

      <p>It comes amid Dan hitting back at claims of a "threesome" with former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> co-stars <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-natalie-nunn-celebrity-big-13090053">Natalie Nunn</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-chloe-ayling-celebrity-big-13077500">Chloe Ayling</a> .</p>
      <p>While Jacqueline was in the jungle, Dan denied fresh cheating claims made by model Chloe.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media he blasted the comments, before sharing mass support for his wife and the mother of his two daughters, Ella and Mia.</p>
