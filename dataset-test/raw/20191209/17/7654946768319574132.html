      <h1>Florida girl arrested for posting ‘death list’ on Snapchat</h1>

      <p>A 12-year-old Florida girl was arrested after posting a “death list” on Snapchat of students from her middle school, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The girl, who was not identified, was taken into custody late Saturday after another student at Falcon Cove Middle School in Weston told deputies of the social media threat, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday.</p>
      <p>The post on Friday contained a “death list” naming several of her fellow students, while a second message indicated that they were in danger and would be killed at the school on Monday, deputies said.</p>
      <p>Detectives were able to trace the messages back to the girl, who confirmed that she made the fake threat, sheriff officials said.</p>
      <p>The student is now facing two counts of a written threat to kill and false reporting concerning a firearm.</p>
      <p>A message seeking comment from Broward Schools was not immediately returned on Monday.</p>
      <p>Weston is roughly 25 miles south of Parkland, where a former student <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/02/14/17-killed-in-florida-high-school-shooting-one-of-deadliest-in-history/">killed 17 people during a school shooting massacre in February 2018</a>. Confessed gunman Nickolas Cruz, 20, faces the death penalty in the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p>
      <p>Jury selection in Cruz’s trial is expected to begin in late January, <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/2019/11/18/alleged-school-shooter-nikolas-cruz-files-motion-to-dismiss-judge-from-case/">WPLG reports</a>.</p>
