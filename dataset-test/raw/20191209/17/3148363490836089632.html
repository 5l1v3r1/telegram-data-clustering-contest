      <p>The action-packed trailer features Gal Gadot, who plays the famed DC Comics hero, stating, “Nothing good is born from lies and greatness is not what you think” as a series of scenes flash on the screen, showing the demigoddess fighting in spectacular fashion. It also features a brief shot of actor Pedro Pascal, who plays villain Maxwell Lord, and Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, whose reappearance “seems to be related to Pascal’s sinister Maxwell Lord,” Gizmodo <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/wonder-woman-1984s-first-trailer-is-here-to-bring-justi-1840299595">muses</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Premiered during Comic Con Experience São Paulo, the trailer was shown at a panel featuring director Patty Jenkins and the rest of the cast. During the panel, Jenkins emphasized the big ‘80s aesthetics of the film, and proudly talked up the film’s stunt work, which relied on non-digital effects to replicate the imagery and vibe of film’s from the time period.</blockquote>
      <p>“The first teaser is out! Stay tuned for the full trailer tomorrow!! Here we go…!!!” Gadot tweeted Saturday alongside the trailer’s preview, which features a snapshot of chaos ravaging the nation’s capital. The official <i>Wonder Woman</i> Twitter account also posted the preview, which garnered over 1.5 million views within hours. It was up to over 4 million views as of Monday morning:</p>
