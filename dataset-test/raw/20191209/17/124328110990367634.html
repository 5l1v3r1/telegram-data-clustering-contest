      <p>It shows a homeless man named Ryan having a drink before lying down on the bench, as the camera pans out.</p>
      <p>It continues: 'In the 20 minutes we filmed Ryan on this bench passers-by gave him a hot drink, two chocolate bars and a lighter - without him ever asking for anything.' </p>
      <p>After the video was posted, excited fans flocked to the site outside the Jewellery Quarter train station to take photos.</p>
      <p>But after several hours, West Midlands Police were forced to erect metal barriers as a matter of 'crowd control' to stop people sitting on the bench.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for the force said: 'We've been called just to monitor the situation due to the number of people heading down there.</p>
      <p>'We are just keeping an eye on the situation. It's more of a crowd control matter.'</p>
      <p>A commuter who passed by on her way to work on Friday morning claims she saw a man setting up close to the wall.</p>
      <p>She said: 'It was around 7 o'clock on Friday morning when I got off the bus and saw a man giving a few snacks to a homeless man who was sitting on the bench.</p>
      <p>'I wouldn't have thought it was Banksy, I just thought it was someone helping out the homeless.'</p>

      <p>Jeweler Martin Clarke claims to have seen two workmen early on Friday morning working on the wall, which is directly outside his shop.</p>
      <p>He said: 'I saw a small tent with a couple lads in high-vis vests early in the morning on Friday. I thought they were from the council and were just doing a bit of upkeep.</p>
      <p>'About half six I looked out the window and the tent had gone as had the lads. Then I saw it.</p>
      <p>'I thought it was great. We weren't sure what it was at first or who did it but we had a good idea.'</p>
      <p>Michael Knowles added that the new mural will be a welcome boost to the area.</p>
      <p>He said: 'I think it's absolutely wonderful for the Jewellery Quarter. It's incredible. When I saw it I was convinced it was a Banksy.'</p>
      <p>Phil Simpkin also said that the mural will give local businesses a helping hand ahead of the festive period.</p>
      <p>She said: 'It's fantastic for the area and a big boost. Hopefully more people will come to the Jewellery Quarter to see the mural.'   </p>
