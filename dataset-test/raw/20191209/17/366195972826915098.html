      <p>Whether or not we ever see a <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Three6Mafia/profile">Three 6 Mafia</a> reunion remains to be a mystery but in the meantime, the members are still dishing out a ton of solo music. <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dj-paul/profile">DJ Paul</a> has continued to flood the streets with new music while contributing as a producer for some of the biggest artists in the name. This weekend, he came through with a brand new single titled, "I'm So Juiced Up." DJ Paul calls on <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf/profile">Yelawolf</a>, Seed Of 6ix, and DJ Ease for some assistance on the track. With a heavy instrumental that's bound to electrify the clubs and the streets alike, he brings along Seed Of 6ix and Yelawolf on the track to deliver that muddy Southern sound.</p>

      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>Brown bottle my true vice<br/>Drunk drive on my way home<br/>Dodgin' the police preyin' eyes<br/>Let the sunshine on my blue chrome</p>
