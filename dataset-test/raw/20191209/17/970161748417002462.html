      <h1>James Gallagher urges Nick Diaz to stay retired after 'scary' comeback vow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:52:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author">Coral Barry</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-gallagher/">James Gallagher</a> is hopeful Nick Diaz will remain retired after the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ufc/">UFC</a> fighter signalled his intentions to return to the octagon.</p>
      <p>Diaz gave a lengthy and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/nick-diaz-wants-jorge-masvidal-fight-2020-gamebred-responds-aggressive-style-11081357/">often muddled interview to ESPN last month</a>, sparking concern from fans and fighters about his well-being.</p>
      <p>It was the first time in years Diaz had given a sit-down interview and was a rare glimpse into the man who has had such a huge influence on modern <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mma/">MMA</a>.</p>
      <p>Gallagher watched the interview and admitted he was alarmed by Diaz’s demeanour and insistence he wanted to fight again.</p>
      <p>‘That was scary. I don’t know what it is, punch drunk? It’s not weed, that’s not weed,’ Gallagher told <b><i>Metro.co.uk.</i></b></p>

      <p>‘That’s punch drunk. What was he even saying? There was a clip took off that was 58 seconds long of him speaking and he didn’t say anything.</p>
      <p>‘He was saying stuff like “I’ll walk if they want me to walk”, what? I don’t even think he knows what he’s saying.</p>
      <p>‘It’s scary and that interview was scary. He’s still a legend. I like him a lot. I’m a big fan, but I’m concerned with his health.’</p>
      <p>Diaz has not fought since his January 2015 clash with Anderson Silva, which was ruled a no-contest after both fighters failed drug tests.</p>
      <p>USADA then banned Diaz for 18 months for testing positive for marijuana in that fight and the former welterweight has since served another suspension for failing to report his whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Diaz was thought to be done with fighting before he called out <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jorge-masvidal/">Jorge Masvidal</a>, who beat his brother, Nate, at Madison Square Garden at UFC 244.</p>

      <p>Gallagher admitted he was worried about Diaz’s state of mind and urged him to stay away from fighting.</p>
      <p>‘I feel he should retire,’ Gallagher said. ‘I want him to be happy and retired. He seems like he’s in a bad place, he’s hurting.</p>
      <p>‘Lots of athletes let loose and party for a few months. They’re just having fun after all the pressure.</p>

      <p>‘That’s fine, but when you’re doing that and hiding something and you’re hurting, that’s a dangerous situation to be in.</p>
      <p>‘I’m sure he has a few quid to sustain that lifestyle, so he doesn’t need to fight.’</p>
      <p>‘You’ve got stay ahead of yourself and be real with yourself,’ he added. ‘Things turn quick. You’ve got to build yourself back up. Be real with yourself.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve got to learn to roll with the punches and not walk into them, like Nick was doing.’</p>
