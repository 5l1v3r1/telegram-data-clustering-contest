      <p>Residents were left fuming at the weekend after putting up with "over the top noise" which some heard more than six miles away.</p>
      <p>People living in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Sefton</a> and across <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Liverpool</a> said they could hear "incessant noise" on Saturday which they soon realised was coming from a music event on the docks.</p>
      <p>The show - Tomorrowland Garden of Madness at Liverpool Central Docks - saw thousands of people take to the dance floor between 2pm and midnight on Saturday at the Creamfields Steel Yard, however it left some <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Sefton</a> residents furious.</p>
      <p>Tony Hall, a carer from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bootle">Bootle</a> contacted <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> who said the noise was "over the top" and he could feel "booming base" through his garden and house.</p>
      <p>Speaking <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">to the ECHO</a> he said: "I live in Bootle and could hear it there and my friend told me they could hear it the booming all the way in Netherton.</p>
      <p>"Someone wants their wrist slapping because of how loud it was.</p>
      <p>"It was like something you would have in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree">Aintree</a> in the summer and I could just feel a boom base - I mean no disrespect to the musician."</p>
      <p>Tony said he tried to contact authorities on the evening, but he couldn't get through.</p>
      <p>He added: "They didn't state how loud or give the volumes it was giving out."</p>
      <p>People living in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Bootle, Seaforth</a> and places nearby also took to social media to vent about how loud the event was.</p>
      <p>In a reply to a tweet sent out by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/creamfields">Creamfields</a> , @zaphriel said: "I can hear what tunes you're playing. I live in Seaforth. Stop taking the p***."</p>
      <p>A second user who claims they are from Bootle tweeted <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-council">Liverpool City Council</a> , <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/creamfields">Creamfields</a> about the noise.</p>
      <p>User @RachelSimms8 added: "@lpoolcouncil, @MerseyPolice, @Creamfields I've signed up to Twitter just to complain about the incessant noise from #SteelYardLiverpool in Bootle. I've got a poorly one-year-old, absolute joke #officialcomplaint."</p>
      <p>A third Twitter user from Bootle also said: "I live in Bootle and I need some space to chill because the constant bass is so loud it’s driving me mental. This is an official noise complaint @mayor_anderson, @lpoolcouncil, @MerseyPolice."</p>
      <p>A fourth user, @JoSGillespie, also from Bootle added: "@MerseyPolice how the hell is this level of noise allowed when it’s causing ear ache, one and half miles away from @Creamfields in Bootle until midnight?</p>
      <p>"I understand that the council gave permission but how is this not a disturbance of the peace?"</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-council">Liverpool City Council</a> said: “We have received a number of complaints and are currently in the process of reviewing noise measurements recorded by the organisers during the event.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">The ECHO</a> approached Creamfields for comment.</p>
