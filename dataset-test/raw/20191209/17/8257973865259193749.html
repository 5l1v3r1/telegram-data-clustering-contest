      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- The U.S. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/supreme-court/?tps=1">Supreme Court</a> declined to hear a case Monday that accused Purdue Pharma of moving billions of dollars in an effort to shield them from a spate of pending lawsuits over the popular opioid painkiller OxyContin.</p>
      <p>The state argued in the suit Purdue and its owners, the Sackler family, has transferred about $6 billion over the past decade, which it says violates a fraud statute.</p>
      <p>The high court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/120919zor_ihdj.pdf">refused to hear</a> the case without comment.</p>
      <p>Purdue Pharma filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/09/16/Purdue-Pharma-files-for-bankruptcy-as-part-of-opioid-settlement/9511568615326/">in September</a> as part of a deal valued at $10 billion and included $3 billion from the Sackler family to settle more than 2,000 opioid lawsuits.</p>
      <p>Although a bankruptcy judge granted the Sackler family temporary legal protection, the state argued, it didn't apply to its appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>Purdue Pharma is facing lawsuits in nearly every state, accused of fueling the U.S. opioid crisis for profit by aggressively marketing the drugs while downplaying the risks.</p>
