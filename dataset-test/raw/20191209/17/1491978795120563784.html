      <h1>Russian PM labels doping ban 'anti-Russian hysteria' – video</h1>
      <h2>Russia's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has called the decision by the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) to ban Russia for four years 'anti-Russian hysteria'. The decision made on Monday will see Russia banned from competing at the Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Individual athletes will be able to compete, however they will not be able to represent Russia but instead compete under a neutral banner as long as they can prove they are drug free<br/>   •  Russia banned from Tokyo Olympics and football World Cup</h2>
