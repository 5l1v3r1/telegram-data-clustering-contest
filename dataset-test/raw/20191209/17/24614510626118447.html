      <p><b>2020 iPhone</b>: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/08/2020-iphones-smaller-battery-protection-module/">A new rumor claims that Apple may increase the battery size in next year’s iPhone</a>, reports <i>MacRumors</i>. According to this rumor, the tech company will be able to do this due to a new battery protection part. This will be smaller in size than the older component, which in turn frees up more room for the battery. It’s unknown how much of a larger battery the 2020 iPhone may get thanks to this change.</p>
      <p><b>Mac Pro Approval</b>: <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/12/09/apple-gets-fcc-approval-for-mac-pro-tower-and-rack-mount-version">Apple fans are getting closer and closer to the launch of the new Mac Pro</a>, <i>AppleInsider</i> notes. New approval from the Federal Communications Commission has it clearing two versions of the computer for radio frequency emissions. That’s the normal tower Mac Pro and the new rack-mounted server version. While this doesn’t reveal when the devices will come out, it does confirm that AAPL is moving along with their production.</p>
      <p><b>Golden Globes</b>: <a href="https://ww.9to5mac.com/2019/12/09/the-morning-show-golden-globes/">Apple TV+ may have only come out this year but it’s already receiving Golden Globes nominations</a>, reports <i>9to5Mac</i>.
