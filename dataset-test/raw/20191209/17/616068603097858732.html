      <p>By now you’ve seen the cringey Peloton exercise bike commercial and read all about how it has outraged the people of the internet.</p>
      <p>In it, a husband buys his wife (now known widely as “Peloton wife”) an exercise bike, and we see the awkward “116-pound woman’s yearlong fitness journey to becoming a 112-pound woman.”</p>
      <p>Ryan Reynolds and his gin company, Aviation, decided to capitalize on the… er… popularity of the commercial, casting the main character in a 40-second spot that was just released.</p>
      <p>The actress’s name is Monica Ruiz. She’s seen holding a martini staring blankly into space, accompanied by two friends who seem concerned for her well being.</p>
      <p>“This gin is really smooth,” she says, before consuming the entire thing in one go.</p>
      <p>The Peloton video is titled "The gift that gives back." Reynolds' cheeky gin commercial is titled "The gift that doesn't give back."</p>
      <p>Peloton trivia: “Peloton husband” is played by actor Sean Hunter, the gym teacher at Simon Fraser Elementary school in Vancouver.</p>
      <p>If you thought the song in the commercial was familiar, that's because it’s the 1998 hit “She’s So High” by Victoria’s Tal Bachman.</p>
