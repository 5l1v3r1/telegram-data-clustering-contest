      <h1>David Arquette Says He’d Love to Return for New ‘Scream’ Movie But Hasn’t Gotten Any Calls Yet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:36:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/john-squires/" target="_blank">John Squires</a></address>
      <p>We broke the news last month that <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3593128/spyglass-resurrection-ghostface-new-scream-exclusive/">Spyglass is resurrecting Ghostface</a> for an upcoming new installment in the <b><i>Scream</i></b> franchise, and at this point in time it’s unclear if the next film will continue to be set in Wes Craven’s four-film universe or be something of a remake/reboot. If it is indeed a sequel to <i>Scream</i> 1-4, for what it’s worth, <b>David Arquette</b> would love to return.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://movieweb.com/scream-5-david-arquette-dewey-returning/">Movie Web</a> recently, Arquette made it clear that as much as he’d love to play Officer Dewey one more time, he hasn’t actually received any phone calls at this time.</p>
      <blockquote><i>“My phone has not rang and I know nothing. I honestly don’t. And I’m not just saying that</i>,” Arquette told the site.</blockquote>
      <p>The actor continued, “<i>So I know just like you that they’re working on a script, apparently. <b>I don’t know if our characters are going to be involved. It’d be nice. It would be exciting to be a part of it.</b> It’ll be sad that Wes [Craven] isn’t there but I would love to see his legacy continue and the great projects and films that he was a part of an afterlife, and continue what he started. I would love to see more Nightmare on Elm Streets. I’d love to see more Screams. I just think he’s such an incredibly talented and amazing person. I’m so honored that I had gotten to work with him, just in general.”</i></p>
      <p>Arquette added,<i> “So, whatever they decide to do, it’s what they’ll decide. You can’t bet on stuff like that. You just have to keep doing what you’re doing</i>.”</p>
      <p>In all likelihood, Spyglass’s revival of the <i>Scream</i> franchise is in the very early stages of planning, so it makes sense that none of the franchise’s stars know much about it at this time.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more as we learn it.</p>
