      <p>As the election campaign enters its final days, the two main party leaders are continuing to follow very different tactics on the ground.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has spent almost half of his time in Conservative marginal seats.</p>
      <p>Some 31 of the 68 campaign visits made by the Labour leader so far have been to Tory constituencies that are on Labour’s target list.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn has been to only one Tory stronghold – and that was to take part in one of the televised debates.</p>
      <p>By contrast, he has made appearances in 16 Labour strongholds, typically for a party rally or to launch a policy.</p>
      <p>And he has actually been to slightly more Labour strongholds (16) than Labour marginals (13).</p>
      <p>If the Labour leader has focused chiefly on taking the fight into Tory territory, his Tory counterpart has opted for an alternative strategy.</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson has been to only 12 Labour marginals so far, out of a total of 54 visits.</p>
      <p>He has also been to 10 Labour strongholds.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister’s schedule has covered a broader range of constituencies than that of the Labour leader, including a strikingly large number of visits to marginal seats being defended by his own party (19).</p>
      <p>While Mr Corbyn has been to six constituencies being defended by the SNP, Mr Johnson has been to only one (Dunfermline &amp; Fife West).</p>
      <p>And while Mr Johnson has been to one Liberal Democrat seat (Brecon &amp; Radnorshire), Mr Corbyn has not been to any.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader has also been further afield, visiting seats in Cornwall, north-east England and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader has instead concentrated the majority of his visits in the Midlands, Yorkshire and north-west England.</p>

      <p>Both party leaders will be privy to polling data commissioned by their own parties, and some of this may be determining their choice of campaign visits.</p>
      <p>But from the evidence of their itineraries to date, it seems as if Mr Corbyn is treating the election as a battle to be advanced on only one front – against the Conservatives – while Mr Johnson has been playing a mixture of offensive and defensive tactics.</p>
