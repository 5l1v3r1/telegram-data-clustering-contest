      <h1>Manny Diaz Announces Update On Miami’s Quarterback Situation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:22:29+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Miami Hurricanes are heading to the Walk-On’s Independence Bowl to face Louisiana Tech after a disappointing 6-6 season. Things haven’t gone the way Manny Diaz expected them to this season – specifically at the quarterback position.</p>
      <p>Despite heading into bowl season, it appears the Hurricanes’ QB battle is still up for grabs. Diaz spoke to the media on Monday to update the situation.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Manny_Navarro/status/1204077402156089344">Manny Navarro of The Athletic</a>, the “QB job is open” for the Hurricanes heading into bowl game preparation.</p>

      <p>As Navarro points out, Diaz clarified the position battle will come down to practice and academic performance. It would come as no surprise if Miami decides to play both Jarren Williams and N’Kosi Perry in the bowl game though.</p>
      <p>Diaz has gone back and forth between Williams and Perry this season. Both have shown flashes of brilliance, but consistency remains the main issue. There’s also Tate Martell, who’s been absent from the team <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/tate-martell-not-transferring-miami-personal-leave">dealing with a personal issue</a>.</p>
      <p>Williams earned the start in Miami’s season opener against Florida and made the most of his opportunity, throwing for 214 yards and touchdown against the Gators’ elite defense. After a few more impressive outings, Williams went down with an injury against Virginia Tech in Week 7, opening the door for Perry.</p>
      <p>Perry shined in Williams’ absence, most notably throwing for 422 yards and four touchdowns against a stout Virginia Tech defense. Williams retook the job after coming back from injury a few weeks later.</p>
      <p>Diaz has a tough decision on his hands for the Hurricanes’ upcoming bowl game.</p>
