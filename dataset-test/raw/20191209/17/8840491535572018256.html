      <p>SINN Féin Councillor Gerry Murray walked out of a meeting of Mayo County Council this afternoon (Monday) in protest over how the previous week's budget meeting was conducted.</p>
      <p>He took issue with cathaoirleach Councillor Brendan Mulroy for refusing an adjournment of the budget meeting, stating it was 'shameful' that he would not accede to this request.</p>
      <p>The adjournment was to allow for a counter proposal to an amended budget proposal put forward by Fianna Fáil and supported by the independent grouping.</p>
      <p>However, Councillor Mulroy said he had asked five times for a counter proposal and there was none. Had there been one he would have adjourned proceedings so both could be looked at.</p>
      <p>The budget, he said, was adopted unanimously as there was no counter proposal.</p>
      <p>Fine Gael Councillor Patsy O'Brien said he had sought the adjournment as they had a proposal, but then they couldn't give that alternative as the figures had changed from what they were given before that. They couldn't come up with the figures without an adjournment.</p>
      <p>After some heated debate across the council chamber among members, the chief executive, Peter Hynes, said the meeting was run correctly from a procedural point of view and decisions made were above challenge.</p>
      <p>Councillor Murray said the issue was the failure to concede to an adjournment.</p>
      <p>He made a comment about the 'disgraceful performance' by the cathaoirleach, which he was asked to withdraw or else the meeting would be suspended.</p>
      <p>At that stage Councillor Murray indicated he would be leaving the meeting and he immediately did so.</p>
