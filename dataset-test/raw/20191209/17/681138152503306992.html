      <p>The striker has been sidelined since February following a cruciate knee ligament injury suffered at Norwich but made his return to action for the Under 23s in their 4-1 loss to Millwall earlier today.</p>
      <p>He's likely to play for the young Blues again next Monday, when they host ???? at Playford Road, but is hopeful of being back with the first-team for the visit to Fratton Park on December 21.</p>
      <p>"I'm obviously delighted to be back on the pitch again," Freddie told the club website.</p>
      <p>"It's been a long road back but I came through okay today and I feel really good.</p>

      <p>"I took a few tackles and blocks which you don't really get in training but it was important to get through that physical side of it.</p>
      <p>"It's 23s and there is a big difference in the intensity compared to first-team football but it's 45 minutes of game time and I've got to build up on that now.</p>

      <p>"I'm naturally quite fit and I've done a lot of work fitness wise in getting to this point but I need time on the pitch now.</p>
      <p>"I think the plan is for me to play for the 23s again next week and then if that all goes fine, hopefully I can be available for the game at Portsmouth before Christmas."</p>
      <p>Teddy Bishop, who has been out with a knee injury suffered on Town's pre-season tour of Germany, is also understood to be close to a return to action.</p>
