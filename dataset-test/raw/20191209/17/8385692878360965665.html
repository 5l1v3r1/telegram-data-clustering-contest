      <p>Amazon has a rather unique deal going on right now for the Pixel 4 and <a href="https://geni.us/7fGhG">Pixel 4 XL</a>. You can save up to $150 on these new smartphones, and you're getting Google WiFi thrown in for free. This is for a single Google WiFi, and not a three-pack.</p>
      <p>The Google Pixel 4 with Google WiFi comes in at $699 and the Google Pixel 4 XL with Google WiFi comes in at $749. So it's $100 off of the Pixel 4 and $150 off of the Pixel 4 XL.</p>
      <p>You can get these for the same price without Google WiFi included too.</p>

      <p>Pixel 4 was released just a couple of months ago, back in October. It's currently the latest and greatest smartphone from Google. It comes in two sizes: Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. The main differences between these two are the display sizes and battery capacities. With a 5.7-inch full HD+ display and 2800mAh capacity battery on the smaller Pixel 4. The Pixel 4 XL has a 6.3-inch Quad HD+ display with a 3700mAh capacity battery.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, both of these sport the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There is a 128GB model, but that is not part of this deal at this price.</p>
      <p>What really makes the Pixel impressive though, is the camera. It's a 12-megapixel main sensor here and a 16-megapixel telephoto available as well. This is going to give you some really great Portrait shots, as well as some really good looking zoom shots. Instead of needing to crop after you take the photo, just zoom in and grab it.</p>

      <p>Google WiFi is the original mesh WiFi system from Google. It's going to offer you faster speeds, even with more devices on your network. Making it great for smart homes.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the Google Pixel 4 and Google WiFi bundle from Amazon <a href="https://geni.us/qllLsP9">by clicking here.</a> It's unclear how long this bundle is going to last.</p>
