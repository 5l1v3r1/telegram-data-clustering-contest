      <p>Maura Higgins has hinted that she may be too busy with Dancing On Ice to watch the new series of Love Island.</p>
      <p>The former grid girl, 29, came in fourth place alongside boyfriend Curtis Pritchard in this year’s series of Love Island, and the pair are still an item.</p>
      <p>ITV is airing two series of the show in 2020, using a new villa in South Africa this winter before returning to Majorca in the summer.</p>

      <p>Asked whether she planned to watch the new series, Higgins said: “I hope to. It’s exciting. I’ve just been busy with this.</p>
      <p>“Probably, if I get the time, but I hope to last a long time in this. I want to be training every single day. I am very focused on this.”</p>
      <p>The reality TV star said professional dancer Pritchard had not been able to offer her help since she began training six weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the series launch, she said: “It’s very different. We have not practised anything. It’s very different to what he does.</p>
      <p>“When I am out of the ice rink I like to just take my mind off it and then start fresh the next day.</p>

      <p>“There is always something new to learn.”</p>
      <p>Higgins also revealed that the Dancing On Ice contestants share a WhatsApp group.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s fun. It’s so much fun. Everyone is amazing. We get on so well.</p>
      <p>“The banter is just crazy. There is a WhatsApp group. It never stops.”</p>
      <p>Higgins is competing on the ITV ice-skating show alongside stars including Ian “H” Watkins and Michael Barrymore.</p>
