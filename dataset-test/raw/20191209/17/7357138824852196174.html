      <h1>Prosus Boosts Just Eat Bid To $6.5B</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:48:32+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Naspers-owned Prosus upped its bid to $6.5 billion on Monday (Dec. 9) to acquire London’s food delivery service Just Eat, putting pressure on rival buyer Takeaway, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-just-eat-m-a-prosus/just-eat-takeover-battle-hots-up-with-fresh-6-5-bln-prosus-bid-idUSKBN1YD0JJ">Reuters</a> reported.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.just-eat.com/">Just Eat</a> favors <a href="https://www.takeaway.com/">Takeaway</a>’s all-share bid, although the new cash offer from Prosus is 5 percent more. <a href="https://www.prosus.com/">Prosus</a> upped its offer to 740 pence per share, from 710 pence. The technology group also dropped its acceptance threshold to 50 percent plus one share, down from 75 percent.</p>
      <p>“Unlike the Takeaway.com offer, which relies on (its) shares remaining at an above-sector multiple, our cash offer provides certainty of value to Just Eat shareholders,” Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Shareholders are advised to take no action with regards to the increased offer at this time,” Just Eat told Reuters.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2019/takeaway-sweetens-just-eat-bid-to-challenge-prosus/">Takeaway</a>’s CEO Jitse Groen said the latest Prosus offer was “derisory” and was 9 percent lower than Just Eat’s share price as recently as Aug. 13.</p>
      <p>“A slightly higher derisory cash bid remains a derisory cash bid,” Groen said, urging <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2019/just-eat-recommends-declining-prosus-offer-in-favor-of-takeaway/">Just Eat</a> shareholders to accept the Takeaway offer. He added that a Takeaway and Just Eat merger would “combine our two great companies to create the largest global platform in online food delivery outside China.”</p>
      <p>He also said the Prosus offer “significantly undervalues Just Eat” and doesn’t consider the additional value that a combined Just Eat-Takeaway.com will offer shareholders.</p>
      <p>Investor <a href="https://catrockcap.com/">Cat Rock</a> owns 5.9 percent of Takeaway and 2.6 percent of Just Eat. It said Prosus should pay a minimum of 925 pence per share for Just Eat “to compensate investors for the upside they might miss in a Takeaway tie-up,” which it supports.</p>
      <p>“This revised Prosus offer is wholly inadequate and shows Just Eat shareholders that Prosus cannot muster a credible bid,” Cat Rock told Reuters.</p>
      <p>By Dec. 12, both bidders are expected to report “how many shares their offers have won.” If neither company prevails, an auction process will begin on Dec. 27 with Britain’s <a href="http://www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk/">Takeover Panel</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/acquiring/2019/just-eat-snubs-prosus-offer-will-move-forward-with-takeaway-merger/">Last month</a>, Just Eat turned down a hostile £4.9 billion ($6.3 billion) cash bid from Prosus.</p>
