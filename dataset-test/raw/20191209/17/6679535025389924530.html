      <h2>Police seek permission to file case against magistrate</h2>

      <p>The Trivandrum Bar Association has expressed ‘regret at the unfortunate things’ that occurred in the chamber of the Judicial First Class Magistrate 1 of Thiruvananthapuram recently.</p>
      <p>The lawyers had reportedly wrongfully restrained, abused and threatened Deepa Mohan, the magistrate, on November 27, over a judicial order, she had issued.</p>
      <p>It was the cancellation of the bail order of an accused that reportedly provoked the lawyers, who rushed into her chamber and threatened and abused her.</p>
      <p>The police had also booked cases against the office-bearers of the bar association following a complaint filed by the magistrate. The lawyers had also boycotted the court following the developments.</p>
      <p>However, the Kerala Bar Council intervened in the issue and held discussions with senior judges of the Kerala High Court and the association leaders.</p>
      <p>The regret letter from the lawyers comes as part of a conciliatory effort of the Bar Council.</p>
      <p>In its letter, which was submitted to the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapruam, the bar association leaders also indicated that they ‘always stand for an harmonious Bench and bar relationship.’</p>
      <h3>Permission</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Kerala High Court has received a letter from the police seeking permission for proceeding in a case against Ms. Mohan on a complaint filed by a woman lawyer of the Thiruvananthapuram bar.</p>
      <p>The woman lawyer had accused the magistrate of physically assaulting and abusing her.</p>
      <p>The permission of the Chief Justice is required for booking a case against a judicial officer.</p>
      <p>On inquiry, if the complaint is found to be wrong, the Chief Justice can reject the request and order to book a case against the complainant for filing a false complaint.</p>
      <p>A full court meeting of the judges of the Kerala High Court on Monday discussed the developments related to the issue and also the letter of regret filed by the lawyers.</p>
