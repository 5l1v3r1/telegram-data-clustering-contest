      <p>Police is working with National Emergency Management Agency to coordinate a search and rescue operation following a volcanic eruption at White Island this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The eruption occurred about 2:11pm.</p>
      <p>White it was initially believed there were approximately 100 people on or near the island at the time of the eruption, we now believe there were fewer than 50.</p>
      <p>Some of those people have been transported to shore, however a number believed to be on the island are currently unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>Of those transported to shore, at least one has been critically injured.</p>
      <p>Emergency services are working to ensure the safety of everyone involved, including rescue staff.</p>
      <p>A volcanic eruption is hazardous in the immediate vicinity of the volcano.</p>
      <p>Volcanic hazards may impact on and near the volcano.</p>
      <p>Ashfall may impact areas distant from the volcano.</p>
      <p>People should stay out of designated restricted zones.</p>
      <p>A no-fly zone has been established.</p>
      <p>People living in or near the affected ashfall areas should:</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>Be aware of the potential for ashfall.</p>
      <p>Consider staying indoors.</p>
      <p>Volcanic ash could be a health hazard, especially if you suffer from breathing difficulties.<br/>2.</p>
      <p>When indoors, close all windows and doors to limit the entry of volcanic ash.<br/>3.</p>
      <p>If caught in volcanic ashfalls: Wear a dust mask or use a cloth handkerchief over your nose and mouth; protect your eyes by wearing goggles.</p>
      <p>Wear eyeglasses, NOT contact lenses as fine ash will get under the lens.<br/>4.</p>
      <p>Listen to the radio and/or TV for further assessment and updates.<br/>5.</p>
      <p>Effects of a volcanic eruption can be experienced many kilometres from a volcano.</p>
