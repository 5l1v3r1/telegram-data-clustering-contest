      <h1>Health Minister Simon Harris calls on Dara Murphy to return expenses money</h1>
      <h2>The Minister for Health has broken ranks and directly challenged Mr Murphy to give the taxpayer something back</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:22:39+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Ferghal Blaney</a></address>
      <p>Simon Harris has called for money-mad politician <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dara-murphy">Dara Murphy</a> to pay back expenses earned while he was double-jobbing.</p>
      <p>The Minister for Health has broken ranks with his ministerial colleagues and directly challenged Mr Murphy to give the taxpayer something back.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think he should.”</p>
      <p>Mr Harris also said that just because Mr Murphy has quit the Dáil, doesn’t mean he can’t still be audited on his unusual expenses claims by the Dáil’s accountants.</p>
      <p>Mr Murphy announced last week that he has formally resigned his seat in the Dáil, along with the lucrative salary and expenses package worth over €150,000 a year - including at least €50,000 a year in expenses based on his representing the people of Cork.</p>

      <p>But this was only the tip of the iceberg, as he was also earning in the region of €10,000 a month in another job in Brussels.</p>
      <p>Since October 2017, Mr Murphy had been coining it with the European People’s Party (an alliance of right-wing European parties of which Fine Gael is a member) as a director of elections.</p>
      <p>This meant that he was getting paid for doing two jobs, in two different countries, for the guts of two years, until the European elections finished this summer.</p>
      <p>The backbench TD with the Dáil’s worst attendance record on sitting days since 2017 was therefore getting paid more than the Taoiseach or the British Prime Minister during this time.</p>
      <p>Mr Harris came out yesterday and told the Irish Mirror that he thinks Mr Murphy should pay back some of the expenses claimed as a TD over the past few years.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think he should (pay back expenses), but before you and I decide what that level should be, for someone who is not you or I to have a look at this.</p>
      <p>“And while he is no longer a Member of Dáil Eireann, my understanding is that all expenses for any TD are still auditable for up to five years.</p>
      <p>“All of us get that every year when we make a declaration, it says you are auditable for up to five years even when you are not a TD any longer.</p>
      <p>“So I do know that, for example, if you lost your seat in a general election, you could still be audited on your expenses for the previous years when you were a TD.</p>

      <p>“So there are still functions whereby audits can be carried out and investigations can happen and I’m sure that will take place.”</p>
      <p>Mr Harris was also asked about the prospect of an early general election next year if a motion of no confidence is tabled against him as Minister for Health.</p>
      <p>He replied enthusiastically, saying that he is “so looking forward” to next year’s election, whenever it comes.</p>
