      <p>Police are investigating after a video circulated on social media appears to show diners snorting drugs at a Liverpool restaurant.</p>
      <p>The video, filmed at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-restaurants">Dash restaurant</a> on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-city-centre">Victoria Street</a> on Friday night, shows two men sat at a table while a third friend films them.</p>
      <p>All three have now been barred from the restaurant.</p>
      <p>One of the men can be seen dipping a knife into a bag of white powder and moving it over to his friend's nose.</p>
      <p>A voice can be heard saying: "Aren't you out tonight no?" while the man shakes his head.</p>
      <p>The powder is then raised up to his nostril and he sniffs it off the end of the knife, while everyone at the table howls with laughter.</p>
      <p>The video, which was shared with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> , it understood to have been shared widely via social media on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>A frame at the end of the video shows the man who appeared to sniff the substance with a steak and chips in front of him and a caption that said: "Obviously not eating that now" accompanied by four laughing emojis.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Dash said: "Dash is committed to providing a safe, healthy and secure environment for all of our customers and staff.</p>
      <p>"The incident involving a small group of diners in our restaurant (over the weekend) was reported to our staff on the evening itself.</p>
      <p>"The guests involved were immediately asked to leave and have been barred.</p>
      <p>"We have a zero tolerance policy towards the use or implied use of drugs.</p>
      <p>"As an independent business, we value all our customers and staff and see ourselves as a family friendly venue, with peopleâ€™s welfare of the utmost importance.</p>
      <p>"Our aim is to provide the finest dining experience in the city, giving every guest a unique experience from the moment they walk up the steps to the moment they leave."</p>
      <p>The restaurant opened its doors in 2018, with nightclub XOXO also included in the venue.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> said they were aware of the video and were investigating after it was brought to their attention.</p>
      <p>In a brief statement shared with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> , a spokesman for the force urged anyone with more information to contact @MerPolCC or 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
      <p>The private Instagram account which allegedly shared the video was also approached, but did not respond to our request.</p>
