      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">Super Falcons</a> of Nigeria striker, Asisat Oshoala has said she would not be disappointed if the 2019 African Women’s Footballer of the Year doesn’t come to her.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that Oshoala is up against Ajara Nchout, Tabitha Chawinga and two others for the top prize in the women’s category of the CAF Awards.</p>
      <p>“Particularly for me, I don’t know what my chances are but I just feel, whatever happens, it’s fine by me,” Oshoala told Goal.</p>
      <p>“Going for my fourth award, I think it is a very good thing. I just want to be consistent. It is the most important thing for me.</p>
      <p>“It is not about getting one and being comfortable. I just want to better each year and much more helpful for every team I play for anywhere I find myself.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really know if 2019 is my best year because I’ve always been good for a couple of years.</p>
      <p>“So, I really wouldn’t say 2019 is the best but yeah, I must admit I had a lot of opportunities to play at the world stage like in the Champions League final and a couple more games.</p>
      <p>“I have not had a good chance to play in the Champions League before, although I played twice while I was at Liverpool. So, I can say 2019 because I won a [Champions League] silver medal.”</p>
      <p>The award winner will be announced during the CAF Awards ceremony on Tuesday, 7 January 2020, at the Albatros Citadel Sahl Hasheesh, Hurghada, Egypt. The Super Falcons captain has won it thrice in the past.</p>
