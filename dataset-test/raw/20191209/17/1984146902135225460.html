      <h2>April Hunter speaks about her big ambitions in boxing after making history in her debut on the Lewis Ritson Utilita Arena card</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:55:36+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Johns</a></address>
      <p>April Hunter made history in October when she became the first ever Newcastle-born female professional boxer, but her ambitions are far higher than that.</p>
      <p>Making a dream debut on the big Lewis Ritson-Robbie Davies Jnr undercard in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle">Newcastle,</a> Hunter was impressive in defeating Borislava Goranova.</p>
      <p>The Bulgarian entered the ring with the experience of 73 pro bouts prior to that outing, including two defeats to Cecilia Braekhus where she avoided a stoppage and lasted 14 rounds in total with the Colombian, widely regarded as one of the best active female <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/boxing">boxers.</a></p>
      <p>Hunter almost did what Braekhus couldn’t as she stiffened the legs of Goranova and came close to getting a stoppage on home soil, only for the visitor’s experience to help her see out the final bell.</p>
      <p>Hunter is back in on Friday at the Rainton Arena for her second professional bout, and is feeling confident after getting that debut out of the way.</p>
      <p>“There is naturally a lot of nerves for that first one. I had limited amateur experience anyway, but then going pro, making my debut on such a huge card, and knowing I was making a bit of history too all made it a bit of a wild night,” Hunter said.</p>
      <p>“What a way to make my debut though. It was amazing. If I’m honest, I don’t remember much of the fight. It’s hard to explain but I think you would know if you’re a fighter, you just kind of go into this zone and block everything out once the bell goes, and I was really happy with my performance.</p>
      <p>“And the experience overall, the noise during my ring walk, being backstage for such a big show and then soaking up the atmosphere for Lewis’ fight after I’d taken care of business, it was all just amazing.</p>
      <p>“We’re back out again on Friday and it’s another journeyman, but it should be another good learning fight for me against someone with far more experience. I shouldn’t be losing a fight like this if I want to get to where I do, so it’s just a case of taking care of business, ticking over and preparing myself for what I hope will be a big 2020.”</p>
      <p>Hunter certainly has no fear.</p>
      <p>Recently, after the aforementioned Braekhus won in Monte Carlo, promoter Eddie Hearn pointed out afterwards how tough a match it was for the sublime female boxing star.</p>
      <p>Hunter, watching on from home, was quick to offer her services, despite her lack of experience.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day I’m a fighter and I’m in this sport to fight the very best.</p>
      <p>“Of course it would be better to learn and work up to that, but I would be crazy to pass up such an opportunity. If Eddie is struggling he knows where I am.</p>
      <p>“The way I see it, a fight like that is win-win for me. Lose and I’m nowhere different to where I am now.</p>
      <p>“I’m young enough to rebuild, while the things I’ll learn and the exposure I’d get for such a fight would be huge.</p>
      <p>“Win though, and I’d catapult myself right up to the very top of the world rankings, which is what I’m aiming for anyway.</p>
      <p>“I genuinely believe I’d win that fight. Braekhus is a superb boxer, you can’t deny that, but she doesn’t have power, whereas I do.</p>
      <p>“If I could catch her, I think she’d struggle to take my power.</p>
      <p>“Whatever happens though, the plan in 2020 is to be active and move up those rankings quickly. The women’s divisions aren’t as stacked as the men’s yet, so it allows you to progress quicker.”</p>
      <p>Hunter forms part of the Christmas Cracker show which is co-promoted by her manager Phil Jeffries and Steve Wraith. It takes place next Friday evening (December 13) at the Rainton Arena and tickets are on sale from any of the boxers on the card, or on the door on the night.</p>

      <p>As always, Hunter will be boxing in memory of her late cousin Paul Gardner who died while holidaying in Ibiza in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/paul-gardners-family-speak-heartbreak-15053739">a tragic swimming accident.</a></p>
      <p>Hunter wishes to draw attention towards the free PGCPR app which is available on all smartphones and has been developed in Paul's memory. The app guides users through the steps to administer potentiallys life-saving CPR, with clear text and audio-visual instructions.</p>
