      <p>Actress Kara Tointon was spotted last night in London on a date night with her Norwegian-born fiancé Marius Jensen.</p>
      <p>The former <i>EastEnders</i> star, 36, donned a dressed down look as she braved the cold weather while walking hand-in-hand with her other half.</p>
      <p>Wrapping up in a simple fleece and baggy jeans, with her hair tied in a messy bun, the former Strictly winner showcased a much more casual look than fans are used to seeing her in.</p>
      <p>Loved-up Kara and Marius recently celebrated their son Frey’s birthday who turned one in November.</p>

      <p>Kara confirmed she was expecting her first child in early 2018 at the same time that she announced her engagement to Jensen.</p>
      <p>The <i>Mr Selfridge</i> star first sparked pregnancy speculation in August 2018 when she cradled her stomach on the red carpet at The Festival Premiere.</p>
      <p>Speaking to HELLO Magazine after the birth of baby Frey, Kara admitted that the entire experience had changed her life.</p>
      <p>“It’s an incredible time. It’s the biggest life changing moment when you have this little human being come into your life that you are yet to meet. I can’t wait for Motherhood and all the challenges it will bring’.</p>

      <p>As it turns out, she had gotten secretly engaged in March after Marius popped the question with a vintage ruby and diamond Bavarian engagement ring.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Hello Magazine, Marius admitted that he had planned the most romantic proposal but his eager nature got the better of him in the end.</p>
      <p>‘"I had planned for a big proposal on the beach in India on holiday but I am not very good at keeping secrets. I’m someone who gives people their Christmas presents a week early… and so instead it just happened here at home, one Sunday morning, the week before we went away’’.</p>

      <p>On her surprise engagement, Kara, 36 recalled : ‘’We were having a lie-in and I had no idea he was planning to propose’’.</p>
      <p>‘’It was so perfect as I am not someone who likes big moments, and it was just very Marius – He says it as he feels it. It was very lovely, very relaxed."</p>
