      <h1>Ripple Director of Product Launches XRP Entertainment Marketplace for Music</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:00:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Ripple’s director of product is rolling out a new digital marketplace that will allow musicians to sell their songs online for XRP.</p>
      <p>Called “xSongs,” the platform utilizes Payburner, an integrated payment system built on top of the XRP Ledger, <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoCwby/how-to-publish-your-music-for-xrp-b0e3e2a64669">says</a> Craig DeWitt.</p>

      <p>There’s no fee to upload or post songs, and musicians will receive 100% of the revenue from their sales through peer-to-peer XRP payments.</p>
      <p>The marketplace won’t support legacy payment methods and allows creators to set their own price.</p>
      <p>DeWitt <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCwby/status/1203894481860227074">says</a> the short-term goal of the platform is not to make money, but to create a thriving product that increases the usability of XRP.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“If you can build a product that drives significant value to the market, monetization will not be a problem.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Uber loses money on ever [sic] ride they give, but they’ve built something incredibly valuable.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The project is currently in beta for the uploading/publishing side of the marketplace, which includes a wallet and the ability to manage music.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Once we’ve gotten enough music uploaded and finished building the front end marketplace, we’ll turn on the purchasing side of xSongs.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This will be the front end to allow anyone to buy songs.” </i>
      </p>
      <p>That’ll likely happen in a few weeks, after the publishing build-up phase concludes, according to the Ripple executive.</p>
