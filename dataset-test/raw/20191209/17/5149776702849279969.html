      <p>Former Notts County midfielder Garry Thompson has announced his retirement at the age of 38.</p>
      <p>The former Bradford City star announced his decision to quit on social media, calling time on a career that nearly spanned 12 years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> were among Thompson’s clubs with the winger, who also played as a striker, making 46 league and cup appearances from July 2014 to July 2015.</p>
      <p>He scored 12 goals under then boss Shaun Derry, but the campaign ended in disappointment as the Magpies were relegated from League One.</p>
      <p>But he also enjoyed incredible success, winning promotion with Morecambe and Scunthorpe, while also being part of the Bradford side that went on a memorable FA Cup run that took them to the quarter-finals four years ago.</p>
      <p>Thompson wrote: “I wish I could go back in time and meet my eight-year-old self, kick a ball around on my own pretending I was playing at Anfield with all my heroes, just so I could tell him that he would get to live his dream of being a professional footballer.</p>

      <p>“The time has come, I’ve made the hardest decision I think I’ll ever make in my life and that’s to retire from playing football.</p>
      <p>“And what a journey it’s been, over 11 and a half years. Helping Morecambe FC get promoted will always be one of my greatest memories.</p>
      <p>“To the promotion with Scunthorpe United FC and that historic season with Bradford City AFC including that amazing cup run and a certain goal.</p>
      <p>“I can’t thank my former teammates, gaffers, staff and supporters enough, I’m very privileged to say I’ve made some friends for life.</p>
      <p>“Finally, and most importantly, to my family and friends, without your love, your understanding, your support and guidance, I wouldn’t have been able to succeed. Thankyou.</p>
      <p>“Love to you all, Thomo.”</p>
      <p>Thompson said he will continue with coaching at GT7 Academy and finish off his UEFA A Licence.</p>
