      <h1>Eminem Angrily Responds To Nick Cannon's Gay Sex Allegations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:50:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Shortly after Nick Cannon backed up his initial claims <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53749/title.nick-cannon-suggests-his-eminem-gay-sex-diss-lyrics-are-true">there is video of Eminem</a> giving another man oral sex, Slim Shady fired back on Twitter.</p>
      <p>On Monday night (December 9), Em wrote, “U mad bro? Stop lying on my dick. I never had a chauffeur you bougie f*ck.” He concluded his tweet with a clown emoji.</p>

      <p>Em followed up with, “I demand an apology Nicholas, you’ve made my gardener so jealous!”</p>

      <p>The <i>Wild ‘N Out</i> host was the target of Em’s wrath on Fat Joe’s new single <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/singles/id.37865/title.eminem-disses-nick-cannon-on-fat-joe-dres-lord-above">“Lord Above”</a> featuring Mary J. Blige. During his verse, he took aim at both Cannon and his ex-wife Mariah Carey.</p>
      <p>As a result, Cannon launched his own missile in Shady’s direction with “The Invitation.” He made the bold gay sex claim in one of his verses, spitting, “I heard your chauffeur got a video of you sucking a cock/You paid him off then laid him off/Now who really the opps.”</p>
      <p>Evidently, that was enough to arouse Shady from his slumber. Diss track up next? </p>
