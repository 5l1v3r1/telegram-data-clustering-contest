      <p>BMW of North America announces a power increase for some of its Model Year 2020 vehicles. The 2020 BMW M550i xDrive and 2020 BMW X3 M40i and X4 M40i xDrive are part of the power bump for next year, from the same engine units.</p>
      <p>The biggest increase is found in the 2020 M550i sedan, which saw the output from its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 increase from 456 hp and 480 pound-feet in 2019 to 523 hp and 553 lb-ft in 2020. That’s nearly a 15-percent boost which was achieved thanks to larger turbochargers, new intake manifold and ports, higher fuel pressure, a stronger block, reinforced pistons, and new engine management, BMW spokesman Oleg Satanovsky told <a href="https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1126271_bmw-quietly-increases-power-of-some-m-branded-cars-for-2020">Motor Authority.</a></p>

      <p>The 2020 <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/08/11/test-drive-2019-bmw-x3-m40i/">BMW X3 M40i</a> and X4 M40i have also seen their power output go up, from 355 hp to 382 hp. The 5 percent increase comes from an increased boost pressure, revised engine management, and upgraded exhaust components. This power update brings the M40i models in line with the 2020 BMW Z4 M40i and the 2020 M340i.</p>
      <p>While the power increase is not directly related to a price bump, the fact is that the 2020 models have gone up in price. The base price for the 2020 BMW M550i increased by $2,200, and it now includes equipment changes such as an active rear differential and heated seats. The prices for the X3 and X4 M40i rose $1,250 and $550, respectively, and also include small equipment changes.</p>
      <p>Just last week, BMW also announced the pricing for the US Market for both 2 Series Gran Coupe variants; the BMW 228i Gran Coupe and the<a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/11/test-drive-2020-bmw-m235i-xdrive-a-new-kind-of-bmw/"> BMW M235i</a> Gran Coupe. For the entry-level model in the US, the 228i, pricing starts at $37,500, before $995 destination. As for the high-performance BMW M235i Gran Coupe, it starts life at $45,500 before a $995 destination fee.</p>
