      <p>The gathering is designed to set an agenda for sustainable peace and development in the continent.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Monday, December 9, the president’s spokesman, Femi Adesina, made this known, he also stated that that the president would return to the country on Friday.</p>
      <p>The forum, which holds between December 11 and 12, is an initiative to address the interconnections between peace and development in Africa while promoting Africa-led solutions through strengthening policies and practices.</p>
      <p>“The initiative is being launched by the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in his capacity as the Chairman of the African Union (AU) and as an advocate of Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development in Africa – a recurring theme of his tenure as the AU Chairman,” Mr Adesina said.</p>
      <p>“It is also grounded in the AU’s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and the search for African solutions to African problems.</p>
      <p>“The gathering is expected to bring together heads of state and government, leaders from regional and international organisations, financial institutions, private sector and civil societies.</p>
      <p>“(Others are) scholars, visionaries and prominent experts for action-oriented discussions on the threats, challenges and opportunities.</p>
      <p>“It is also expected to end with a Declaration on the theme of the Forum and become an annual event.”</p>
      <p>Buhari will be accompanied by Governors Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa, Godwin Obaseki of Edo and Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State.</p>
      <p>Others are Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi; Minister of State, Foreign Affairs, Zubairu Dada; National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno; and the Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar.</p>
