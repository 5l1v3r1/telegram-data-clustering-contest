      <p>President Donald Trump made Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server a hallmark of his 2016 campaign, but the president now regularly conducts phone calls using unsecured devices, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/phone-logs-in-impeachment-report-renew-concern-about-security-of-trump-communications/2019/12/05/2066fbf4-16fe-11ea-8406-df3c54b3253e_story.html">The Washington Post</a>.</p>
      <p>Top government officials typically use encrypted phone services to protect calls or texts from being intercepted by hackers, but several officials told The Post that Trump routinely used unsecured phones.</p>
      <p>To put that in context, Business Insider spoke with cybersecurity experts about the risks associated with unsecured phones.</p>
      <p>Alex Heid, the chief research officer of <a href="https://securityscorecard.com/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIupSryOuo5gIVBhgMCh32MAU0EAAYASAAEgKYAPD_BwE">SecurityScorecard</a>, said that unencrypted phone services were exceptionally easy to hack.</p>
      <p>“In some cases, it’s as simple as walking into a cellphone tower, plugging in a laptop, and downloading everything,” Heid said. “It’s generally so easy to hack it’s scary.”</p>
      <p>Kiersten Todt, the managing director of the Cyber Readiness Institute who previously served as a cybersecurity adviser to the Obama administration, said gaining access to unsecured phone activity was well within the capabilities of sophisticated hackers.</p>
      <p>“With enough time and focus, which we know that many malicious actors have, it’s certainly doable,” Todt said.</p>
      <p>Here’s a breakdown of how hackers can gain access to unsecured phone activity and how encryption can protect against hacks, according to experts.</p>

      <h3>Encrypted phones have been the standard for top-ranking government officials dating back to World War II, when extensive technology was employed to protect against wiretapping.</h3>

      <h3>Phone encryption became much less expensive with the advent of the internet. Most encrypted phone lines now use software called “voice over internet protocol” to shield against spying.</h3>

      <h3>Most standard phone services, however, including calls and texts, are “basically wide open,” according to Heid, who said, “It’s unencrypted data stream that’s broadcast over the airways.”</h3>

      <h3>“Hackers are constantly hacking telecom carriers,” Heid said. “In some cases, it’s as simple as walking into a cellphone tower, plugging in a laptop, and downloading everything.”</h3>

      <h3>There are now a range of smartphone apps that provide encrypted calls and messaging services, including Signal, Wickr, and WhatsApp. The latter is used intermittently by White House officials, according to The Washington Post.</h3>

      <h3>Convenience is the primary reason people opt to use unsecured rather than encrypted phone services. “There’s always that trade-off between encryption and ease of use,” Heid said.</h3>

      <h3>There have been several instances of targeted phone hacking in the past year alone. One tactic, known as SIM swapping, involves fraudulently persuading a mobile carrier to transfer control of a phone number to a hacker’s device.</h3>

      <h3>“Mobile security is something that the government is still struggling to prioritize,” Todt said. “Given the use of smartphones across business and government use, we’ve got to figure it out.”</h3>
