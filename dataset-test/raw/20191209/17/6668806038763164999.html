      <h1>Shah Rukh Khan fears being lonely and sad if he directs movies</h1>

      <p>Despite his absence from the big screen for a year now, Shah Rukh Khan continues to be one of the most loved superstars not just in India but across the globe. Just recently he appeared on Tom Brook's chat show, Talking Movies, where he discussed a variety of subjects including his career, films, his recent setbacks on the big screen, the #MeToo movement and the new wave of the mid-level Indian films.</p>
      <p>When Brook asked SRK whether he'd ever contemplate taking up direction, SRK responded by saying that directing movies is an extremely lonely job and he always worries that if he were ever to do it, he'd genuinely get lonely and more and more removed from the regular way of living. He said, "Here you are kind of playing God, you are making a film, you are telling actors how to act, choosing the dialogues, making the script, selling it to the audience, going into theatres, editing it in dark rooms. When the film comes out you are all alone in the success and failure of it. I think being a director is an extremely lonely job. Being a star already has made me a very reclusive or quieter in my own space. Right now I feel alone and happy. If I become a director I may become lonely and sad."</p>

      <p>SRK also revealed that he's a huge Christopher Nolan fan and if he were to direct a film, it'd probably be an action movie. He explained, "I would like to direct an action film. I want to grow up and be Christopher Nolan. But I don’t know if I have the gumption. The big problem with me is I don’t know when to say ok. And the director’s big job is a roll, camera, action, cut, ok. I don’t know how to say ok. I feel it can be better or was it good enough. So I am a little wary of being a director."</p>

      <p>Well, we as an audience would definitely love to watch Shah Rukh Khan wear the director's hat someday. </p>
