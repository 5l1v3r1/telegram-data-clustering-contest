      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:53:35+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author">Millie Dent, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Virgin Galactic's stock is soaring after an analyst said its space planes could one day disrupt the air travel industry, potentially raking in nearly a trillion dollars a year in sales.</p>
      <p>The spaceflight's company stock surged 12% Monday after Morgan Stanley released a report predicting Virgin Galactic's shares could rise as high as $60 over the coming years if the company successfully executes its business goals. The stock was sitting just below $8 before the report was released.</p>
      <p>Galactic wants to transition from a space tourism company (it has still yet to fly any civilians into space, but it plans to soon) into a travel company. It intends to accomplish that by building space planes that send passengers on ultra-fast flights around the world.</p>
      <p>"A viable space tourism business is what you pay for today," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors. "But a chance to disrupt the multi-trillion-dollar airline [total addressable market] is what is really likely to drive the upside."</p>
      <p>Galactic's stock had persistently fallen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/virgin-galactic-stock-market-spce/index.html">since it began trading</a> on the New York Stock Exchange on October 28. Morgan Stanley set a near-term price target of $22 a share, which represents a 167% increase from Galactic's current level of $8.24. The firm believes the majority of Galactic's upside will come from its hypersonic point-to-point air travel rather than its space tourism business.</p>
      <p>"The shares feature biotech-type risk/reward where today's space tourism business serves as a funding strategy and innovation catalyst to incubate enabling tech for the hypersonic point-to-point air travel opportunity," Jonas said.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley isn't alone in its bullish outlook for Galactic. Sam Korus, an industrial innovation analyst at ARK Invest, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/tech/virgin-galactic-earnings/index.html">said last month</a> he was excited about Galactic's potential line of business. His research indicates as many as 2.7 million people might be willing to pay up to $100,000 for a long-distance hypersonic flight that shaves hours off the normal travel time.</p>
      <p>The company has long talked about conducting long-distance flights, and Boeing in October invested $20 million in the company in a deal focused largely on aiding development of hypersonic transit.</p>
      <p>Galactic, which is the world's first publicly traded space-tourism company, reported in its inaugural earnings last month that it lost $138 million in the first nine months of 2019. By far its largest expense — nearly $100 million — went to research and development.</p>
