      <h1>Joker Lands Four 2020 Golden Globes Nominations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:49:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>It seems that it’s not just the general public that liked <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/joker"><b>Joker</b></a> — given the movie’s huge box-office success — but also the journalists from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Now that the nominations for the upcoming 77th Golden Globe Awards have been revealed (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2020-golden-globes-nominations-full-list-1259626/item/best-original-score-motion-picture-1259643?fbclid=IwAR1QpUgObFJXk719iZv_YeCmbkeDEGNdawSlaFCD1QTmYlZf0C-jL4N2h08">The Hollywood Reporter</a>), it turns out that Todd Phillips’ movie has been nominated to four categories.</p>
      <p>Arthur Fleck’s story will compete for the Best Motion Picture – Drama award, while Todd Phillips will go for Best Director – Motion Picture. The competition is tough, though. Phillips’ <b>Joker</b> will go head to head with Sam Mendes’ <b>1917 </b>and Martin Scorsese’s <b>The Irishman</b>. Noah Baumbach’s <b>Marriage</b> <b>Story</b> and Fernando Meirelles’ <b>The Two Popes </b>got nominations too.</p>
      <p>Phillips, on the other hand, will lock horns with Bong Joon Ho (<b>Parasite</b>) and Sam Mendes (<b>1917</b>). Martin Scorsese (<b>The Irishman</b>) and Quentin Tarantino (<b>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</b>) complete the quintet.</p>

      <p>Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur Fleck didn’t go unnoticed either. Phoenix got a nomination for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama, and his chance to win is really high. The final selection sees him face Christian Bale (<b>Ford v Ferrari</b>), Antonio Banderas (<b>Pain and Glory</b>), Adam Driver (<b>Marriage Story</b>), and Jonathan Pryce (<b>The Two Popes</b>).</p>
      <p>Last but not least, Hildur Guðnadóttir brought home a nomination for the Best Original Score – Motion Picture. The Icelandic composer will face Alexandre Desplat (<b>Little Women</b>), Randy Newman (<b>Marriage Story</b>), Thomas Newman (<b>1917</b>), and Daniel Pemberton (<b>Motherless Brooklyn</b>).</p>
      <p>It won’t be easy for Todd Phillips’ movie to win all the awards, but it’s not impossible either. The fans can dream.</p>
      <p>The Golden Globe Awards ceremony will take place on January 5, 2020. Which award(s) do you think <b>Joker </b>is more likely to bring home? Let us know your prediction in the comments section below.</p>
