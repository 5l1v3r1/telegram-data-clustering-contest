      <p>The son of Derbyshire's former High Sheriff Annie Hall, who tragically lost her life after being swept away in floods last month, has paid moving tribute to her at a packed memorial service.</p>
      <p>Almost 600 people crowded into <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-cathedral">Derby Cathedral</a> today to pay tribute after Mrs Hall's tragic death near Darley Dale where the River Derwent had burst its banks.</p>
      <p>The congregation, which included the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire and their son Lord Burlington, who is the current Derbyshire High Sheriff, Derbyshire Lord Lieutenant Willie Tucker and other former High Sheriffs of the county, heard a series of tributes, prayers and poems dedicated to the memory of Mrs Hall.</p>
      <p>They included words from her son David Pickup, who described his mum as a "supporter, advisor, leader, listener, friend, granny, bossy big sister and mum".</p>
      <p>He said: "One of Annie's greatest traits was her ability to deal with the person in every situation, not the title or label or role in life they had.</p>
      <p>"She was a ferocious reader and she was the only person I know to have worn out a Kindle and she was also a prolific diarist, keeping daily notes as well as more detailed journals of her trips."</p>

      <p>Mr Pickup also revealed that Mrs Hall was a "mean needle worker" and very proud of her family.</p>
      <p>He praised her for taking opportunities in life, including moving from Dorset to Bedfordshire to Derbyshire, being involved with a business that brought her into contact with the Derbyshire Chamber of Commerce that in turn led to her becoming the first female head of the Training and Enterprise Council in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall became involved as a trustee with Umbrella in 2011, which supports families with children with special needs to take part in activities.</p>
      <p>It has been announced that a new property in Derby, acquired by Umbrella, where young adults can develop life and independence skills will be called The Annie Hall Centre once refurbishment is completed and it is opened officially.</p>
      <p>She also spent 2017 as High Sheriff of Derbyshire, a position she embraced, according to Mr Pickup, with "great passion, enthusiasm and her usual pizazz".</p>
      <p>He continued: "It was a role she viewed as an honour, celebrating Derbyshire, the place, the people and the organisations, such as the church, university, police or Derby Museum.</p>
      <p>"Through all the opportunities to interact with people, she certainly influenced all the people she met during her life.</p>
      <p>"We are all going to miss her terribly. I will always remember her for dealing with the person and always being ready to open that door to opportunity, even if its the faintest of knocks."</p>

      <p>The service, which featured the Cathedral choir, was introduced by acting dean Rev Canon Dr Elizabeth Thomson and the address was given by the Bishop of Repton, the Right Rev Jan McFarlane.</p>
      <p>A reading from the first letter of Paul to the Corinthians was read by Mrs Hall's husband Michael, who was rescued from the flood water on the night his wife was swept away.</p>
      <p>He said before the service began: "I just wish it could be her sitting there and not her photograph."</p>
      <p>Prayers were read by members of the significant organisations in Mrs Hall's life including Rev Canon Dave Perkins, vicar of Beeley and Edensor, who acts as chaplain to the High Sheriff of Derbyshire; Tracy Harrison, chair of trustees for Umbrella, Tony Butler, executive director of Derby Museum and Professor Kathryn Mitchell, vice-chancellor of the University of Derby.</p>
      <p>Well-known Derbyshire hairdresser Sally Montague was at the service. She said: "I felt the need to come along because she was such an inspirational and strong woman. She inspired me to set up in my own business many years ago and she did a lot for the women of Derby."</p>
      <p>A book of condolence has been open in the Cathedral, where Mrs Hall, 69, was chair of the Cathedral council.</p>
      <p>An inquest into her death opened in Chesterfield three weeks ago and has been adjourned to a later date, although senior coroner Robert Hunter said a pathologist listed the cause of Mrs Hall's death as drowning.</p>
      <p>A private funeral service for Mrs Hall, has already taken place.</p>
