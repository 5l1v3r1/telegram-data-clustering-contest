      <h1>Alfredo Morelos 'will be haunted' by Rangers miss as Andy Walker questions penalty decision</h1>
      <h2>Former Celtic star was baffled by the striker's choice as Fraser Forster saved his Betfred Cup Final penalty.</h2>

      <p>Former Celtic striker Andy Walker believes Alfredo Morelos will be "haunted" by his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup Final</a> penalty miss.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> striker failed to find a way past an inspired Fraser Forster as Neil Lennon's side edged a dramatic encounter at Hampden.</p>
      <p>It leaves Morelos still without a goal against his team's arch-rivals following an afternoon where he spurned a host of chances.</p>
      <p>Walker was baffled by the Colombian's decision to try and place his penalty to Forster's right, believing he should have gone for power instead.</p>
      <p>"I think <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> will be haunted by this Final," Walker told Sky Sports. "I mean, every striker misses chances but to get so many in a Cup Final..."</p>

      <p>"You look at the way he scores goals, I've been so impressed by him this calendar year.</p>
      <p>"He's been terrific, he scores against everyone but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>"And you look at his finishing, he tends to smash everything and he gets it on target.</p>
      <p>"He gets a penalty yesterday and tries to place it in the corner. I didn't really understand his choice of penalty there.</p>
      <p>"He has to bounce back, Rangers have to bounce back because it's a big game on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"And maybe it's an even bigger game at the weekend against Motherwell because the biggest prize this season is the league title.</p>
      <p>"With Celtic going for nine-in-a-row, I think Rangers have shown they're more than a match for Celtic on their day.</p>
      <p>"But they're already a couple of points behind and the last thing they can afford to do is wallow in self pity.</p>
      <p>"They have to bounce back quickly because Celtic will get a huge lift from winning this trophy.</p>
      <p>"They know what it's all about to win a league title and there's a belief here (at Celtic Park) that they're going to get nine-in-a-row."</p>
