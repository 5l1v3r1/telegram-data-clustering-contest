      <p>Claims a schoolgirl may have been "coerced" into a river where she drowned would be probe at an inquest, a coroner has said.</p>
      <p>Tragic Shukri Yahye-Abdi, 12, was pulled from the River Irwell near Bury town centre in June after her mum reported her missing.</p>
      <p>A pre-inquest review hearing today heard claims Shukri, who couldn't swim, was being bullied by other girls when it happened.</p>
      <p>Senior coroner Joanne Kearsley said there was a 'question as to whether alleged bullying was relevant to the inquest', <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/inquest-death-drowned-schoolgirl-shukri-17387894">the Manchester Evening News reports</a>.</p>
      <p>In response, Ashley Underwood QC, representing Shukri's family, replied 'considerably'.</p>
      <p>He added: "The other component is the degree to which there was a relationship of violence between the girls and the degree to which we should be permitted to ask the children about the background to the day."</p>

      <p>When Ms Kearsley asked what violence had taken place, she was told there had been an incident of 'pushing' about six months before Shukri's death.</p>
      <p>Mr Underwood said there was also 'a question of whether, on the day, there was coercion', with Shukri being persuaded against her will to go to the river.</p>
      <p>Mr Kearsley said she would consider the scope of the inquest and report back to all interested parties within seven days.</p>
      <p>Reporting restrictions have been put in place preventing the identification of four children Shukri had contact with after leaving school the day she died.</p>

      <p>The children were referred to as child one, two, three and four.</p>
      <p>The coroner also said she had 'real concerns' whether the children are 'fit enough to give evidence'.</p>
      <p>She added: "I think concerns have been raised by other agencies working with the children.</p>
      <p>"I am going to make some enquiries as to whether the children are able to give evidence from a health perspective."</p>
      <p>Ms Kearsley said that if any of the children are to appear before the inquest it will be done via video link.</p>

      <p>The inquest was adjourned until late February.</p>
      <p>Shukri's loved ones have said she was being bullied at school.</p>
      <p>At a press conference in August, the family's solicitor Attiq Malik revealed that an internal inquiry at Broad Oak Sports College, which has since been renamed Hazel Wood High School, found the school were 'not aware of any bullying of Shukri'.</p>
      <p>At the same conference, one of Shukri's friends insisted she was being bullied.</p>
      <p>She said: "She wanted friends, she wanted to be accepted. She was lonely. If somebody wanted to be her friend she would do anything."</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the child's death.</p>
      <p>An inquiry by the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into the way GMP handled the investigation is ongoing.</p>
