      <p>Jonny Evans has revealed Leicester’s inspiration to chase down Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The defender scored in the Foxes’ dominant 4-1 win at Aston Villa on Sunday as they try to keep the leaders in sight.</p>
      <p>Leicester are second in the Premier League, eight points behind the Reds, after a club-record eight straight wins in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Their last defeat came in a last-gasp 2-1 loss at Anfield in October and they have won every match since.</p>
      <p>Evans said: “The last game we lost was Liverpool and we were really, really gutted that day with the way it ended at the end of the game (a controversial stoppage-time James Milner penalty).</p>
      <p>“I think it gave us a real incentive to come back after that. I think it was just after the international break, so we came back, and we’ve performed tremendously since then.”</p>
      <p>Jamie Vardy, the league’s 16-goal top scorer, netted a brace to score in his eighth straight game, while Kelechi Iheanacho also struck on his first league start of the season.</p>
      <p>Evans told LCFC TV: “I thought we played really well. We had to ride it out, it was quite a difficult start to the game.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit of a battle, a scrappy game, it was probably difficult for the referee but once we settled into it we had some great opportunities on the break.</p>
      <p>“The second one was a great team goal, passing the ball through the lines and a good finish by Kel.”</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish pulled a goal back to make it 2-1 just before the break but Villa sit 17th, outside the drop zone on goal difference.</p>
      <p>They have lost five of their last seven games and boss Dean Smith admitted they failed to handle Vardy.</p>
      <p>“You can’t expect to win football games at Villa Park when you concede 23 opportunities,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Saying that, we went toe-to-toe with them and had 15 ourselves. Defensively, our structure has to be better and individually our defending has to be better.</p>
      <p>“I looked at it at half-time and we’d had as many chances as Leicester, but they had been more clinical.</p>
      <p>“They’ve got a player who two-and-half-years ago people were talking about as a £70million player, in a rich vein of form. He was always going to be difficult to contain and we didn’t.”</p>
