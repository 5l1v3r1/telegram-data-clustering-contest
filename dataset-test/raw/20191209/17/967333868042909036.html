        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - North Korea is a country that has nothing to lose, a senior official remarked on Monday in a statement published by state media, slamming US President Donald Trump's warning to leader Kim Jong-un not to engage in any hostile activities.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We have nothing more to lose", Kim Yong Chol, a senior official in the Central Committee and chairman of the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, said in a statement published by the Korean Central News Agency.</blockquote>
      <p>He said that North Korea <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911301077443680-north-korea-slams-japanese-pm-abe-as-imbecile-and-political-dwarf-amid-rocket-launch-row/">would not reconsider any of its plans</a> in light of discouragement from the United States and warned that any US action on the Korean Peninsula would not go unanswered.</p>
      <p>The most recent rift between Washington and Pyongyang follows the latter's successful test at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground on Saturday, as well as two missile launches on 28 November.</p>

      <p>On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Kim was "too smart and has far too much to lose ... if he acts in a hostile way". He further warned that the North Korean leader "does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States".</p>
      <p>In 2018, relations between <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911181077339452-kim-wont-hold-any-more-useless-summits-just-so-that-trump-can-brag---advisor/">North Korea and the United States appeared to show signs of improvement</a> as Kim Jong-un held direct talks with the presidents of South Korea and the United States. However, the negotiation process came to a standstill this year due to a lack of specific denuclearization measures and resumed missile tests.</p>
