      <h2>Tickets for next year’s festival sold out this afternoon.</h2>

      <p>BODY&amp;SOUL HAS ANNOUNCED it will no longer feature at Electric Picnic, bringing a 16-year partnership to an end. </p>
      <p>The area previously designated for Body&amp;Soul will host Mind &amp; Body at the 2020 festival in Stradbally Co, Laois. </p>
      <p>Organisers behind Body&amp;Soul said they are stepping back to refocus attention on the independent Body&amp;Soul festival, which has been running for the last 10 years in Westmeath. </p>
      <p>“We have decided to step back from our presence and 16-year partnership with Electric Picnic so that we can refocus all of our attention to what the central idea behind Body&amp;Soul is all about: creating an intimate and collaborative festival of the future; one that can embrace social change in a hugely positive way while celebrating an important and ancient Irish feast in our own unique, stand-alone style,” founder Avril Stanley said.</p>
      <p>Organisers of Electric Picnic thanked Body&amp;Soul for being “at the heart of the festival” since its early days as they announced new areas for next year. </p>
      <p> “I am never one to stand still and I constantly strive to evolve the festival. In keeping with this philosophy, I’m excited to announce the creation of Mind &amp; Body in the area previously hosting Body and Soul with the beloved Mindfield moving to a new home on the edge of this creative area,” Festival Republic managing director Melvin Benn said. </p>
      <p>Additionally, another new area will be in place next year called FishTown. </p>
      <p>“FishTown will host the extravagance and creativity of the wonderful Jerry Fish, situated adjacent to Freetown you’ll be able to lose yourselves in the delights of this brand new area.” </p>
      <p>Laois County Council recently granted a license for the festival to increase its capacity from 55,000 to 70,000. Tickets sold out this afternoon after being on sale for under three hours. </p>
      <p>Acts for next summer’s festival, which takes place on 4-6 September 2020, won’t be announced until early next year. </p>
