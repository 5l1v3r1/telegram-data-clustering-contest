        <b>Paris Saint-Germain’s Ander Herrera has been cleared of corruption after a match-fixing investigation into a LaLiga match in 2011</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ander Herrera was one of 36 players cleared of sporting corruption by a Spanish court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Herrera, along with Leganes coach Javier Aguirre and ex-Atletico Madrid captain Gabi, were investigated on suspicion of match-fixing in relation to a LaLiga meeting between Levante and Real Zaragoza in the 2010-11 campaign.</p>
      <p>Zaragoza won the match to keep their place in the top flight, though they were then accused of paying Levante players €965,000 to lose the game.</p>
      <p>However, all 41 people who stood trial have been cleared of the charges, with a Valencian court citing a lack of evidence, though two former Zaragoza officials were convicted of fraud.</p>
      <p>Ex-president Agapito Iglesias and former financial director Javier Porquera were found guilty of using over €1.7million from Zaragoza’s accounts to pay relegation bonuses.</p>
      <p>The pair were each handed a 15-month prison sentence, though they are unlikely to serve time in jail due to Spain’s rules over suspended sentences for first-time offenders.</p>
