      <p>Craig Shakespeare has joined Nigel Pearson’s coaching staff at Watford, the Hornets have announced.</p>
      <p>Shakespeare, 56, was assistant to Claudio Ranieri when Leicester won the Premier League title in 2016.</p>
      <p>He also had a spell as Foxes manager the following year, and now moves to Watford as assistant head coach.</p>
      <p>Shakespeare is a former team-mate of new boss Pearson’s at Sheffield Wednesday, and he also worked alongside Pearson at West Brom, Leicester and Hull.</p>
      <p>He has also previously coached at Everton and had a brief coaching stint with England.</p>
      <p>“Further confirmations with regards to Pearson’s coaching staff will follow in due course,” Watford said on their official website.</p>
      <p>Pearson was appointed as head coach last week, with Watford currently bottom of the Premier League, two points behind Norwich.</p>
