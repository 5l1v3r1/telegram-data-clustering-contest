      <p>The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones are among the best noise-cancelling cans you can buy in 2019, with a fun, lively sound, and a head-turning design that stands out from the crowd – that's why we gave them <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-review">4.5 out of 5 stars in our review.</a></p>
      <p>They're a little different to traditional noise-cancelling headphones, too; normally, they block out environmental sounds around you, so that you can hear your music more clearly (or catch some shut-eye on a noisy flight). </p>
      <p>However, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 apply noise cancellation to your phone calls as well – so the person you're speaking too can hear everything you say clearly even if you're stood on a busy street.</p>
      <p>Audiophiles will be happy with the sound quality on offer here, too, as the 700s offer a wide, balanced soundstage and a vibrant character that makes them incredibly fun to listen with.</p>
