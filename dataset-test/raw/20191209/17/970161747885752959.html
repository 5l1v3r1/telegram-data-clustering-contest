      <p>They don’t seem to go very long without falling out – but this time <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> is fuming with her sister Kourtney and has threatened to boot her off Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</p>
      <p>And it’s all over Kourtney not towing the reality line and spilling all about her personal life.</p>
      <p>On Sunday’s episode, Kim, 39, criticised her 40-year-old sister for avoiding opening up about certain aspects of her personal life and being ‘so secretive’.</p>
      <p>‘Kourtney spends a lot of time off-camera,’ said Kim.</p>
      <p>‘She won’t talk about her relationship, but you’ll see paparazzi photos of her and her guy that I can’t say his name on the show because Kourtney doesn’t want to.</p>

      <p>‘I’ll see things or read about it online and wonder like, did this really happen? Is she talking to this person?</p>
      <p>‘And realise that it’s true, but she’s so secretive with us that she won’t even tell us.’</p>
      <p>Younger sister Khloe, 35, agreed that being transparent with viewers is all part of the Kardashians’ ‘job’, but Kourtney argued there is a ‘fine line’.</p>
      <p>Kim explained that she and Khloe have had to overcompensate for their sibling’s decision to hold things back.</p>
      <p>‘Our job is being open and honest and sharing a lot of ourselves and it just seems like for the past few years now, Kourtney hasn’t really been open about her personal life on camera,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘So all of the days that Kourtney isn’t filming, Khloé and I are picking up the slack and having to share more. Because if we’re not sharing our lives, then what is the show?’</p>

      <p>Shockingly, when Kim and Khloe called Kourtney to discuss the issue, Kim suggested: ‘We have a proposal for you: It starts with an F and ends with a D.’</p>
      <p>She later continued: ‘She doesn’t want to show up, she doesn’t want to work, she has too many f***ing boundaries, she’s out.’</p>
      <p>This is not the first time the sisters have clashed. Their rivalry hotted up in September <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/16/kim-kardashian-makes-kourtney-cry-biggest-fight-rivalry-gets-nasty-really-miserable-human-10749600/">when they had their ‘biggest fight</a>’.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kourtney, who has children Mason, nine, Penelope, seven, and Reign, four, with ex Scott Disick, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/kourtney-kardashian-bites-back-kuwtk-fan-says-contractually-not-entitled-privacy-11413401/">posted a clip on Instagram of her telling her side of the story</a>.</p>
      <p>Kourtney recently revealed she would be taking some time away from the reality show to focus on her brood.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I just decided to spend more time as a mom and put more of my energy there. But I’m not saying goodbye.’</p>
      <p>It’s going to be a tense Christmas!</p>
