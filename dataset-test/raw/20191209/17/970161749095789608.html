      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bbc-2/">BBC</a> viewers were blown away last night (8 December) by an acting ‘masterclass’ from Glenda Jackson in her return to the small screen in Elizabeth Is Missing.</p>
      <p>27 years on from her last major TV role, Jackson starred in the one-off drama as Maud, a dementia sufferer who turns amateur detective after becoming concerned for her friend Elizabeth when she fails to show up for a shopping trip.</p>
      <p>‘But with Maud’s dementia progressing, it is not easy to hold on to the clues,’ the drama’s official synopsis adds.</p>
      <p>‘Despite her meticulous system of recording her discoveries on post-it notes, Maud can’t shake the feeling that she has lost a crucial clue that would unlock the mystery of Elizabeth’s fate.’</p>

      <p>Jackson’s affecting performance was met with near-universal acclaim on Twitter as many people predicted that she’d soon be able to add to her already glittering personal trophy cabinet (which houses two Oscars, a BAFTA and a Tony Award).</p>
      <p>There was also plenty of praise reserved for how the drama highlighted the vital need to support people living with dementia, with the Alzheimer’s Society charity tweeting their approval of the show’s depiction of the disease.</p>
