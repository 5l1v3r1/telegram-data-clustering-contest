        <li>Sony Pictures released the first trailer for <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/ghostbusters-afterlife">“Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a>,” a sequel that follows the original film that was released in 1984.</li>
        <li>The movie centers on a “completely broke” family comprised of a single mom named Callie (played by <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/carrie-coon">Carrie Coon</a>) and her two kids, Trevor and Phoebe, (<a href="https://www.insider.com/category/finn-wolfhard">Finn Wolfhard</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/mckenna-grace">McKenna Grace</a>, respectively) who move to a small town called Summerville.</li>
        <li>Wolfhard’s character explains that a “creepy old farmhouse” was left behind in their name by his late grandfather.</li>
        <li>They discover equipment that belonged to the ghosthunter, including the iconic suits, the ghost trap, and the Ecto-1 vehicle.</li>
        <li>“There hasn’t been a ghost sighting in 30 years. New York in the ’80s, it was like the walking dead,” <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/paul-rudd">Paul Rudd</a>‘s character, a teacher named Mr. Grooberson, says, referring to the events of the first “Ghostbusters” movie that starred <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/dan-aykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a>.</li>
        <li>“Afterlife” also seemingly disregards the 2016 <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/ghostbusters">“Ghostbusters”</a> reboot that was written and directed by <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/paul-feig">Paul Feig</a> and starred <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/melissa-mccarthy">Melissa McCarthy</a>, <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kristen-wiig">Kristen Wiig</a>, and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/leslie-jones">Leslie Jones</a>.</li>
