      <p>The PlayStation 4 version of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft"><b>Minecraft</b></a> is finally being updated to the unified, cross-platform-supporting Bedrock Edition tomorrow, it has been revealed. The news means that Minecraft fans playing on Switch will now be able to play with their friends who own the game on Sony's machine.</p>
      <p>The official Minecraft website goes into a little more detail in a message to PS4 players:</p>
      <blockquote>"The Bedrock version of Minecraft is the unified version of the game that offers the same experience across all consoles. All that glorious, unified code means that you’ll be playing the same game as your pals on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows 10, and mobile! So, yes – that means you get cross-play between those different consoles."</blockquote>
      <p>Nothing else changes for Switch owners - if your copy of Minecraft is up to date, you'll already have the Bedrock edition of the game - but we have been treated to a look at how this PS4 update can improve Switch players' lives in the trailer above. We all sit in colour co-ordinated rooms when playing our favourite consoles, right? <i>What do you mean, 'no'?</i></p>
      <p>Minecraft's been having yet another successful year, earning the title of being the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/12/minecraft_was_the_most-viewed_game_on_youtube_in_2019">most-viewed game on YouTube in 2019</a>. Considering how long the thing's been going, that's a solid achievement.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Do you have any PS4-playing friends who will be ready to team up with you going forward?</i>
