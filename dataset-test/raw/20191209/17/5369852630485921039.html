      <p>WEXFORD GAA HAVE unveiled their new jersey for the 2020 season which carries the name of their new main sponsors, Zurich.</p>
      <p>Some of their inter-county stars were on hand to fashion the new shirt at the official jersey launch on Monday.</p>
      <p>While the 2019 jersey was predominantly purple, the new kit contains more of a split in the colours with a block of yellow covering the top portion of the shirt.</p>
      <p>The sleeves are still purple as is the bottom half of the jersey, while three purple stripes sit on the shoulders.</p>
