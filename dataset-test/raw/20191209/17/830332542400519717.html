      <p>(CNN) - <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/entertainment/the-rise-of-skywalker-column-trnd/index.html">"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," </a>the highly anticipated conclusion to the Skywalker saga, could trigger seizures in photosensitive people, Walt Disney Studios said.</p>
      <p>The company issued a <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/release/2019/12/walt-disney-studios-advises-viewer-caution-related-several-sequences-sustained">statement </a>with the Epilepsy Foundation warning viewers that the film contains "several sequences with imagery and sustained flashing lights" that could affect those with photosensitive epilepsy, the letter reads.</p>
      <p>Disney suggested posting notices at movie theaters to warn viewers of the risk, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-seizure-risk-flashing-lights-1203427472/">Variety</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The company didn't elaborate on how the effects are used or what scenes they appear in. The company has closely guarded the film's plot.</p>
      <h3>People with photosensitive epilepsy can still watch the film</h3>
      <p>Flashing lights at certain intensities and certain patterns can trigger seizures in about 3% of people with epilepsy, according to the <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/triggers-seizures/photosensitivity-and-seizures">Epilepsy Foundation</a>. Anything from the flashing strobe of a fire alarm to flickering computer monitors can trigger seizures in photosensitive people.</p>
      <p>Photosensitive epilepsy happens to be more common in young people, the foundation says, and happens less as those with epilepsy age.</p>
      <p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases, affecting about 50 million people worldwide, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy">World Health Organization</a>.</p>
      <p>The warning doesn't mean<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/entertainment/baby-yoda-jedi-master-disney-trnd/index.html"> "Star Wars" lovers</a> with epilepsy can't find out how Rey, Kylo Ren and co. end the series. The Epilepsy Foundation recommends asking a friend to watch the film first and taking that friend to see the film again to warn about the scenes before they happen.</p>
      <p>It also helps if that friend knows <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/seizure-first-aid-and-safety/first-aid-seizures-stay-safe-side">seizure first aid</a> -- stay with the person, keep them safe and away from objects that could harm them and turn the person on their side if they're not conscious.</p>
      <h3>It's not the first film</h3>
      <p>Similar warnings accompanied <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/health/incredibles-2-seizures-warning-bn/index.html">Disney's "Incredibles II," </a>which contained a sequence of flashing lights that also could have triggered seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Notices were posted in theaters for that premiere after people on Twitter shared concerns.</p>
      <p>And in 1997, flashing lights in the popular television cartoon "Pokemon" were tied to more than 600 cases of convulsions, vomiting, irritated eyes and other symptoms among children in Japan.</p>
