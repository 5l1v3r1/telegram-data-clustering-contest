      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:50:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Michigan football program lost one of its all-time greats this past weekend when former head coach and associate AD Bump Elliott died at the age of 94.</p>
      <p>Many condolences have come out for the Hall of Famer, with Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh among them.</p>
      <p>Taking to his seldom-used Twitter account on Sunday, Harbaugh expressed his condolences to Elliott’s family. He called the former Michigan coach “a great ambassador for the game of football” and lamented the loss of “an outstanding gentleman.”</p>
      <blockquote>My condolences to the Elliott family on the passing of a great Michigan All-American player and coach, Bump Elliott. He was a great ambassador for the game of football and served two elite Big Ten schools in Michigan and Iowa. We have lost an outstanding gentleman.</blockquote>

      <p>Elliott played at Michigan from 1946 to 1948, winning a national title at the 1948 Rose Bowl.</p>
      <p>He quickly joined the coaching ranks and spent a decade working as an assistant between Michigan, Oregon State and Iowa before earning the Michigan head coaching job in 1959.</p>
      <p>In 10 years as head coach, Elliott went 51-42-2, winning the 1965 Rose Bowl over Oregon State.</p>
      <p>He resigned after 1968, and was replaced by the legendary Bo Schembechler.</p>
      <p>After two years as associate athletic director, Elliott was named athletic director at Iowa, where he served from 1970 to 1991. In 1981, the Hawkeyes ended a 23-year bowl drought with a Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl appearance.</p>
      <p>Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to Bump Elliott’s family and loved ones.</p>
