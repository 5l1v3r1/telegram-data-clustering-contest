      <p>For her role as Jo March in Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of “Little Women,” Saoirse Ronan is nominated in the Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama category alongside Cynthia Erivo (“Harriet”), Scarlett Johansson (“Marriage Story”), Charlize Theron (“Bombshell”), and Renée Zellweger (“Judy”).</p>
      <p>Ronan was the only acting nomination that “Little Women” received. The only other category where the film is a contender is in the Best Original Score - Motion Picture category, which sees Alexandre Desplat nominated alongside Hildur Guðnadóttir (“Joker”), Randy Newman (“Marriage Story”), Thomas Newman (“1917”), and Daniel Pemberton (“Motherless Brooklyn”).</p>
      <p>Ronan has been nominated three times previously for a Golden Globe award.</p>
      <p>In 2008, when Ronan was only 13 years old, she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe for her role in 2007’s “Atonement.” In 2016, she was nominated for Best Actress in the film version of Colm Toibin’s “Brooklyn,” and <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/saoirse-ronan-wins-golden-globe-for-best-actress">in 2018 she won the Best Actress Golden Globe</a> for her role in “Lady Bird.”</p>
      <p>Greta Gerwig directed Ronan in both "Lady Bird" and this year's "Little Women," so here's hoping to the duo's luck will continue at the upcoming Golden Globes.</p>
