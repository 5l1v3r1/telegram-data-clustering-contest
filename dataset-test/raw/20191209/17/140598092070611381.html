      <p>Playing in a brass band can help people overcome depression and anxiety, a University of Sheffield study has found. </p>
      <p>Researchers found that playing instruments such as the tuba or trumpet in an ensemble can help to relieve stress, and improve anxiety and depression. </p>
      <p>Sheffield University scientists circulated a questionnaire among current brass band players, asking them about the positive and negative effects of playing in a band.</p>
      <p>The responses revealed that the overwhelming majority of players felt that performing in a brass band had improved their mental health. </p>
      <p>“One has to concentrate on the music and in doing so abandons, if only for short periods, the everyday worries and concerns that we all experience,” said one participant. </p>
      <p>Another added: “Having suffered from depression and anxiety I can confirm that playing in a brass band has helped me through several difficult patches in my life.” </p>

      <p>The research also found that brass band players made new friends, feel part of a community and enjoyed a sense of belonging from being part of a group of musicians.</p>
      <p>Another musician, who had started playing relatively late in life, said: "If you are prepared to spend the time and effort to master a brass instrument, you will never be lonely or bored again.</p>
      <p>"There are so many bands out there and many are crying out for players, that you could be out every day of the week playing with some band.</p>
      <p>"This in turn will lead to great social interaction with people of similar musical interests."</p>
      <p>Dr Michael Bonsor, from the University of Sheffield's Department of Music, said: "Our research has clearly shown that playing in brass bands can be beneficial for individual physical, psychological and social well-being.</p>
      <p>"Players report perceived improvements in respiratory and cardiovascular health, general fitness, cognitive skills, mental well-being and social engagement.</p>
      <p>"Our survey respondents particularly valued the opportunities for community building, reporting a sense of social bonding and belonging, not only within the brass band world but also through their band's musical role in a range of public events and fundraising activities for the wider community."</p>
      <p>He added: "We are hoping that these findings will encourage people to participate in this sociable way of contributing to our physical and mental health."</p>
      <p>The research was published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology: Performance Science.</p>
