      <h1>Strictly Come Dancing: Anton Du Beke 'tipped to retire' after this year's series final</h1>
      <h2>Short odds already</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:31:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hirons</a></address>
      <p>Anton Du Beke reached the final of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> for only the second time in 17 years this weekend (8.12.19).</p>
      <p>But speculation has already begun as to whether pro dancer Anton, 53, will call it a day and walk away from the show after the final, quitting while he's ahead.</p>

      <p>Anton and his partner, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress Emma Barton, reached the final after escaping the dreaded dance-off.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-chris-ramsey-eliminated-in-semi-final/">Comedian Chris Ramsey and his partner Karen Hauer weren't so lucky</a>, as they were eliminated with the judges opting to save Karim Zeroual and his partner Amy Dowden.</p>
      <p>Anton and Emma danced the Cha-Cha-Cha and the Waltz, scoring a 31 and 36 from the judges respectively.</p>
      <p>But with the couple preparing for this week's final, speculation has already started that he may bow out after the last episode of the series.</p>

      <p>According to bookmakers Ladbrokes, odds are 3/1 that Anton retires after this series of Strictly.</p>
      <aside>Strictly wouldn’t be the same without him but the odds suggest we’ll have to get used to life after Anton.</aside>
      <p>A Ladbrokes spokesperson told <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1214916/Strictly-come-dancing-final-Anton-du-beke-retire-winner-strictly-2019">The Express</a>: "Strictly wouldn’t be the same without him but the odds suggest we’ll have to get used to life after Anton."</p>
      <p>ED! has gone to Strictly reps for comment.</p>

      </p>
      <p>For now though, Anton is basking in the fact that he has reached the final.</p>
      <p>He told co-host Claudia Winkleman in last night's results show (8.12.19): "I’ll tell you this, you do something like this for a long time and you love every second of it and think this can’t get any better really...</p>
      <p>"And then someone like Emma comes along and it just goes that... there you go, it is better than you though.</p>
      <p>"It’s a brilliant thing and it’s all because of Emma."</p>
