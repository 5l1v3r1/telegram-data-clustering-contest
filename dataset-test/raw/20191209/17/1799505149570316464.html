      <p>WASHINGTON (CN) — The Supreme Court on Monday <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scotus-12-9.pdf">left in place</a> a Kentucky law that requires doctors to show and describe ultrasound images to patients seeking abortions.</p>

      <p>The law requires doctors performing pre-abortion ultrasounds to display the image during the examination and describe the images to the patient, including the size of the fetus and the presence of internal organs.</p>
      <p>Kentucky has only one licensed abortion provider, EMW Women’s Surgical, which promptly challenged the law, calling it an unconstitutional restriction on its physicians’ speech. Though a federal judge initially sided with the clinic, the Sixth Circuit reversed and upheld the law as an allowable informed-consent procedure.</p>
      <p>EMW appealed to the Supreme Court, pressing its First Amendment claims and arguing the appeals court created a circuit split with its decision.   </p>
      <p>“The act, in short, is on its face a compelled speech mandate wholly unrelated to traditional informed consent and therefore presumptively unconstitutional under this court’s First Amendment precedent,” the clinic said in a petition for certiorari.</p>
      <p>Per its custom, the Supreme Court did not issue any statement in turning down the case. Whether any judges voted to take up the case is unclear; no judge published a dissenting opinion.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for EMW at the ACLU of Kentucky lamented the outcome, calling the Kentucky law a political intrusion on the relationship between doctors and their patients.</p>
      <p>“This law is not only unconstitutional, but as leading medical experts and ethicists explained, deeply unethical,” Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. “We are extremely disappointed that the Supreme Court will allow this blatant violation of the First Amendment and fundamental medical ethics to stand.”</p>
      <p>The Kentucky Governor’s Office did not immediately return a request for comment on the court’s decision to refuse the case.</p>
