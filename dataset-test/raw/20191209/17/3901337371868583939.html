      <p>The French sensation was on the scoresheet as PSG came from a goal behind to beat Keagan Dolly's Montpellier 3-1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However, it was not all rosy as Mbappe snubbed Thomas Tuchel's handshake after being taken off in the 90th minute for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting.</p>
      <p>The German coach, though, has since downplayed the incident, which many compared to Ronaldo's recent reaction to being substituted by Maurizio Sarri.</p>

      <p>"Mbappe never wants to be substituted – it's understandable, and it's quite obvious," Tuchel said, as quoted by <i>AS</i>.</p>
      <p>"He didn't want to be taken off in the Nantes games and he didn't want to come off today.</p>
      <p>"On 90 minutes, I decided to take him off, but now it's all been forgotten about. It was my decision.</p>
      <p>"Choupo deserved to play – we need to respect that and that is in line with the decisions I take. Mbappe isn't happy when he's substituted, but it's no big deal."</p>
