      <p>Victory over an archrival tastes pretty sweet, but celebrating with a free post-win beer tastes much, much sweeter.</p>
      <p>Xavier Musketeers head coach Travis Steele bought $1,000 worth of beer for fans at a local bar after his team took down the Cincinnati Bearcats 73-66 in Saturday’s Crosstown Shootout.</p>
      <p>Steele and his six-year-old son, Winston, arrived at Dana Gardens – a bar located just off of Xavier’s campus – mere hours after the big win. The young, blond-haired baller walked into the bustling joint with his dad as fans whooped and applauded before placing a hulking stack of cash on the bar.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to buy everyone $1,000 worth of drinks,” the elder Steele told two of the bartenders on hand, who were visibly shocked. They then thanked the head coach and shook his hand.</p>

      <p>Steele then addressed the patrons of the bar.</p>
      <p>“Thank you guys for coming to the game. We appreciate all the support,” he said. “I’ve got a thousand dollars up here for all the next drinks.”</p>
      <p>Applause erupted across the bar and drowned out whatever Steele said next.</p>

      <p>A second-year head coach, Steele has led the Musketeers to an impressive 9-1 start to the 2019-2020 season that includes wins over Cincinnati and the UConn Huskies and a close loss against a loaded Florida Gators roster.</p>
      <p>Xavier figures to be a serious contender atop a stacked Big East conference this season. Steele’s squad opens conference play with a tough road test against the No. 23 Villanova Wildcats just before the end of the year.</p>
