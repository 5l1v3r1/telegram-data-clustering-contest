      <p>A South Korean court on Monday jailed three executives of Samsung Electronics for their role in a plot that included burying computers under factory floors at its biotech affiliate, in an investigation of alleged accounting fraud.</p>
      <p>SEOUL: A South Korean court on Monday jailed three executives of Samsung Electronics for their role in a plot that included burying computers under factory floors at its biotech affiliate, in an investigation of alleged accounting fraud.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors began investigating the suspected fraud at Samsung Biologics after South Korea's financial watchdog complained the firm's value had been inflated by 4.5 trillion won (US$3.82 billion) in 2015.</p>

      <p>The episode is the latest legal trouble for South Korea's top conglomerate, whose leader Jay Y. Lee is embroiled in separate trials in a corruption scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye.</p>
      <p>"The boldness of the defendants' criminal acts was beyond the public's imagination and stunned society," Judge Soh Byung-seok said, handing down sentences of up to two years.</p>
      <p>"Most South Korean people want Samsung ... to become the world's top-class company contributing to the country's economy," the judge added.</p>
      <p>"However, if such growth is based on breaches and unlawfulness, it will not be applauded."</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the executives were not immediately available for comment. Samsung Electronics declined to comment, and representatives of Samsung Biologics were not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors accused the executives of ordering employees at the biopharmaceutical firm to destroy and conceal internal documents, as authorities investigated accusations of a violation of accounting rules there.</p>
      <p>The efforts included inserting nearly two dozen computers and notebooks as well as computer servers in spaces under the floors of Samsung Biologics factories near the capital, Seoul, they added.</p>
      <p>Civic groups have said the alleged fraud aimed to boost the value of Samsung Biologics' parent Samsung C&amp;T, adding this was achieved by smoothing the way for a 2015 deal involving the parent and consolidating Lee's control of the group.</p>
      <p>Lee faces charges of having bribed former President Park in return for seeking support in Samsung's succession planning.</p>
