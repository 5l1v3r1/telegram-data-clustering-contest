      <p>A 51-year-old Toronto police officer has been charged in connection with an October incident where a break-and-enter suspect was allegedly shocked three times with a conducted energy weapon and kicked after he surrendered.</p>
      <p>Toronto police say that on Oct. 7 at about 12:50 a.m., two officers were dispatched to the Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue West area for a report of a break and enter.</p>
      <p>The suspects fled the scene in a rideshare vehicle and the officers gave chase.</p>
      <p>When they stopped the car, the suspects got out and fled on foot.</p>
      <p>One of the suspects then surrendered to pursuing officers.</p>
      <p>Police say that “while the suspect was being handcuffed,” an officer drew his conducted energy weapon and fired its prongs into the suspect, shocking him.</p>
      <p>The officer then allegedly switched the conducted energy weapon to “drive stun” mode, where the electrical contacts on the end of the weapon can be pressed directly to a person’s skin.</p>
      <p>The officer allegedly shocked the suspect twice in this manner.</p>
      <p>He allegedly also kicked the suspect.</p>
      <p>On Monday, police identified the officer as Mehrdad Mahmodian.</p>
      <p>He was charged with assault with a weapon, assault, and attempting to obstruct justice.</p>
      <p>He is expected to appear in court on Jan. 4 at 1000 Finch Avenue West.</p>
      <p>Police say Mahmodian has been an officer for 11 years and is currently with 53 Division.</p>
      <p>Investigators say Mahmodian has been suspended with pay since the incident.</p>
