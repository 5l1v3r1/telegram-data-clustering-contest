      <p>In the video, the DMW boss, Davido could be seen carrying his baby boy feeding him and at same time operating his mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Davidoâ€™s love for his kids is not a news as he showers them with love at every given opportunity. Recall he splashed a whooping N5 million on his daughter on a diamond crusted bracelet when they went shopping in Dubai.</p>
      <p>David Adeleke is one celebrity who knows well how to take care of his own, whether family or crew member, he shows his love and benevolence.</p>
      <p>David feeding Ifeanyi is truly an adorable sight, slightly funny though, as he uses his jaw to support the feed bottle as he operates his mobile phone with his hand.</p>
