      <p>An outspoken Iranian female lawmaker says "tyranny," as well as "parallel" state institutions and centers of power, are destroying the "republican" element of the country’s political system.<br/><br/>In a speech to parliament on December 9, Parvaneh Salahshuri also accused the clerical establishment of failing to address the problems of the people, saying: “Except for a minority that enjoy privileges, we have abandoned the rest of the people.”<br/><br/>“If [authorities] were among the people, they would definitely feel the poverty and misery” of Iranians, Salahshuri added.<br/><br/>Iranian media reported that Salahshuri’s speech angered her hard-line colleagues who shouted and asked for her microphone to be turned off.<br/><br/>Salahshuri’s comments follow several days of protests across Iran last month that were triggered by gasoline-price hikes and a rationing plan.<br/><br/>Estimates vary wildly of the death toll from Iranian officials' response to the protests, but Amnesty International says at least 208 people have died as a result of what it called a "shameful disregard for human life."<br/><br/>The real number of dead is likely to be higher, according to the London-based human rights watchdog.<br/><br/>Iranian officials have not released any figure on the death toll.<br/><br/>Salahshuri, a sociologist, had come under pressure in the past for calling for the release of political prisoners and for <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/female-lawmaker-vows-to-take-a-gavel-to-iran-s-political-glass-ceiling/29993621.html">raising some of the issues</a></b> women face in a country where they suffer from legal and cultural discrimination.</p>
