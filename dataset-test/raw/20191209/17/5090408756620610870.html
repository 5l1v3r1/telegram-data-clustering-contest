      <p>Jose Morales, 43, was charged with possessing two stun guns. According to a police report, <a href="https://valley.newhavenindependent.org/archives/entry/missing_toddlers_relative_charged_with_weapons_possession_after_new_haven_s/">viewed by the Valley Independent Sentinel</a>, it would be illegal for him to possess them because he is a convicted felon.</p>
      <p>The arrest happened after police served a search and seizure warrant at his residence in New Haven, Connecticut. Police conducted the search in connection with the homicide investigation, the Sentinel reported.</p>
      <p>Police said Morales’ arrest is not related to the disappearance of his daughter, Venessa, and that he has been cooperative with investigators so far.</p>
      <p>Venessa was reported missing the night of December 2, when police conducted a welfare check on the Ansonia home where she lived with her mother.</p>
      <p>Police found Venessa’s mother, 43-year-old Christine Marie Holloway, dead of blunt force trauma and the girl missing, <a href="https://www.wfsb.com/news/police-identify-mother-found-dead-in-home-where-missing-toddler/article_d9f158be-16b1-11ea-a6d3-678b480fefc9.html">WFSB</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Few details have been released about the nature of the relationship between Jose and Christine. <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/12/03/baby-missing-suspicious-death/">CBS New York</a> reported that Morales lives with his parents in New Haven, but stayed at the Ansonia home occasionally.</p>
      <h3>Venessa Morales is still missing</h3>
      <p>An Ansonia police spokesman said they have no suspects at the moment.</p>

      <p>Last week, investigators searched donation bins after getting a tip about some suspicious clothing, as well as the woods close to a nearby donation bin, <a href="https://fox61.com/2019/12/06/state-police-searching-woods-in-derby-for-evidence-related-to-missing-ansonia-1-year-old/">Fox 61</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Venessa’s aunt, Anna, also gave a tearful press conference last Thursday, pleading with the public for more tips.</p>
      <p>“We desperately need anyone that might be with baby Vanessa to keep her safe, unharmed, and to get her back to us quickly,” she said.</p>
      <p>A representative for the Ansonia police department didn’t immediately respond to Insider’s request for comment.</p>
