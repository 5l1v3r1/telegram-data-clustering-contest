      <h1>Syrian president's uncle stands trial over 'ill-gotten gains' empire in France</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:59:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/henry-samuel/" target="_blank">Henry Samuel</a></address>
      <p>The uncle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stood trial in Paris on Monday accused of pumping tens of millions of pounds of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/06/going-going-gone-african-dictators-losing-luxury-lifestyle-amid/">“ill-gotten gains”</a> into a vast property empire for himself and his extended family.</p>
      <p>However, Rifaat al-Assad, dubbed the "Butcher of Hama" for allegedly commanding troops that put down an uprising in central Syria in 1982, was not present in court “for medical reasons”.</p>
      <p>His lawyers said doctors of the 82-year-old British resident had “recommended he avoid any stressful situations”.</p>
      <p>Mr Assad, who splits his time between France and Britain, has been under investigation in France since 2014.</p>
      <p>He is charged with organised money laundering to illegally build a €90 million (£76m) property portfolio in France.</p>
      <p>His reported French empire comprises two Paris townhouses, one measuring 32,000 square feet, 40 luxury flats, as well as a stud farm, a chateau and 78,500 square metres of office space in Lyon.</p>
      <p>The trial, scheduled to last until Dec 18, concerns crimes allegedly committed between 1984 and 2016, including aggravated tax fraud and misappropriation of Syrian funds.</p>
      <p>He denies the charges.</p>

      <p>Mr Assad, who served as head of the feared Defense Companies paramilitary unit in the 1970s and 80s, went into exile in Europe after a failed coup against his brother Hafez, Bashar’s father, in 1984.</p>
      <p>He has spent the last three decades between his properties in Paris, Marbella and his £10m Georgian townhouse in Mayfair. But the lavish lifestyle of the exile and his four wives and 16 children raised eyebrows.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Sherpa, an activist group representing the victims of financial crime, lodged a complaint which claimed his fortune was stolen during his time at the heart of the Syrian regime.</p>
      <p>The Assad family insists it was the result of gifts from wealthy Saudi supporters, including former king Abdullah, with whom he shared a love of horse-racing.</p>
      <p>Despite documents from Mr Assad's lawyers meant to justify gifts of almost $25 million (£19m) between 1984 and 2010, French investigators registered transfers of only $10 million from Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Beyond France, he and his family built up a huge portfolio of 507 properties in Spain, valued at around €695 million, all seized by the authorities in 2017.</p>

      <p>Mr Assad trial is one of two “ill-gotten gains” cases in court on Monday.</p>
      <p>The other is the appeals trial - also <i>in absentia</i> - of Equatorial Guinea vice-president Teodorin Obiang, who received a three-year suspended jail term in October 2017.</p>
      <p>Obiang is appealing his <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/27/france-convicts-equatorial-guineas-vice-president-corruption/">conviction of squandering €100 million in public money on funding a jet-set lifestyle in Paris</a>, where he owned dozens of supercars and an entire building on the capital’s most exclusive avenue.</p>
      <p>Both trials continue.</p>
