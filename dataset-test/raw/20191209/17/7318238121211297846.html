      <p>A racoon became a social media star in Germany after it was spotted near a Christmas market in what witnesses described as a "drunken" state.</p>
      <p>The animal wandered slowly across tram tracks in the central city of Erfurt on Saturday, seemingly paying little heed to onlookers taking photographs, before settling down to sleep in a doorway.</p>
      <p>A security guard watched over the racoon until it was taken away in a cage by the fire brigade.</p>
      <p>One eyewitness told reporters the animal appeared "either poisoned or inebriated".</p>
      <p>"A breath alcohol test was not done with the animal" a police spokesman joked.</p>
      <p>Local media at first reported that the racoon was being taken to Erfurt's animal shelter. But after the shelter posted on its Facebook page that this wasn't the case, a city spokesman told local broadcaster MDR Thuringia that authorities had no choice but to shoot the racoon because it would have been illegal to set it free.</p>
      <p>He added that a vet had identified signs of canine distemper, a disease affecting a variety of animals which can be fatal.</p>
      <p>The animals should not be released because they endanger the native ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Under German law, racoons are categorised an invasive pet which may be hunted.</p>
      <p>According to the Animal Protection Agency, it is unclear how shelters or rescue centres should handle captured animals.</p>
