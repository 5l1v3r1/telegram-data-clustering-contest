      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:31:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/GNS_Science" target="_blank">GNS Science</a></address>
      <p>Whakaari/White Island erupted today, in a short-lived event that generated an ash plume around 12,000 feet above the vent, GNS Science says.</p>
      <p>The eruption began at around 2.11pm NZST (0111 GMT).</p>
      <p>GeoNet’s webcam images show volcanic ash has covered the main crater floor.</p>
      <p>“Ash fall appears to be confined to the island, although there may be a small amount reaching East Cape in the coming hours,” GNS Science duty volcanologist Geoff Kilgour says.</p>
      <p>“Our monitoring equipment is still operating, and while we have seen a steady decline in activity, there remains significant uncertainty.</p>
      <p>“Currently there are no signs of further eruptions, but we will continue to closely monitor Whakaari/White Island for further signs of activity.”</p>
      <p>The Volcanic Alert Level is at 3 – indicating a minor local eruption.</p>
      <p>“We understand people were on the island immediately before the eruption and we are concerned for their safety,” GNS Science chief executive Ian Simpson says.</p>
      <p>More information will be made available within the next 24 hours.</p>
