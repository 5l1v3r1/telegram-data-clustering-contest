      <h1>How ‘Birds of Prey’ Builds Harley Quinn’s “Girl Gang,” According to Margot Robbie [Set Visit]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:45:30+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/hoai-tran-bui/" target="_blank">Hoai-Tran Bui</a></address>
      <p>Ever since her inception, Harley Quinn has been tied to a man, at some point or another. In her debut in <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, she was introduced as the Joker’s henchman and lover, and despite the character’s wild popularity, she’s never really been able to escape that label.</p>
      <p>But in<b> <i>Birds of Prey</i></b>, <b>Margot Robbie</b>‘s Harley Quinn finally gets to step out from under the shadow of her “Mistah J.” Newly single and ready to mingle, Harley doesn’t attach herself to a new man, but finds a group of similarly empowered crime-fighting women to build herself a girl gang. And although Harley takes the spotlight in <i>Birds of</i> <i>Prey</i> — which is clear in the subtitle itself, <i>And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn</i> — that girl gang is the core of the the upcoming Warner Bros. comic book movie.</p>
      <p><i>Birds of Prey</i> was initially pitched to Warner Bros. as “Harley Quinn’s <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/harley-quinn-movie-pitch-margot-robbie/">R-rated girl gang film</a>,” and Margot Robbie is sticking by that promise. In <i>Birds of Prey</i>, Harley Quinn finds herself assembling a motley crew that includes Black Canary (<b>Jurnee Smollett-Bell</b>), the Huntress (<b>Mary Elizabeth Winstead</b>), and Renee Montoya (<b>Rosie Perez</b>) to save Cassandra Cain (<b>Ella Jay Basco</b>).</p>
      <p>And though Robbie is the undeniable star of the picture, the members of the Birds of Prey have received as much spotlight in the trailers, marketing, and <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/birds-of-prey-poster-mayhem/">posters</a> as Harley Quinn, which is intentional, Robbie told /Film’s Peter Sciretta during a set visit to <i>Birds of Prey</i>. The members are all essential parts of the team, Robbie explained:</p>
      <blockquote>Yeah, it’s an eclectic group, which I love – that everyone has a distinct and different personality, and is coming from a different angle, I suppose. You got Renee, whose set of morals… her moral compass points a very different way to Harley’s and Canary’s. Everyone’s kind of got their own rule of ethics that they abide by, and they kind of conflict with each other, which I think is always interesting in an ensemble.</blockquote>
      <p>So, how did the team get assembled? Robbie says that it all started with Huntress, played by Winstead. The markswoman is a longtime staple of the Batman comics, and one of the core original members of the Birds of Prey, a team that until now has never included Harley Quinn. But reading about Huntress in the comics is what started to solidify Robbie’s vision of <i>Birds of Prey</i>, she explained:</p>
      <blockquote>It really started with Huntress. I just loved Huntress, and with my initial pitch on the story, I said I wanted to keep it quite contained, get no bigger, and no world ending stakes. Like the stakes were as big as perhaps mafia level or gang level. That’s when I started reading a lot of Huntress comics, obviously coming from a mafia family, and found her story. Plus, I always gravitate… well, not always, but I do often gravitate towards a revenge story because it is so straight forward, but you are so clearly motivated. So I find myself getting on board with that mindset quite quickly.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>And then after Huntress it kind of fleshed out from there – which other members kind of counterbalance her revenge story, and Harley’s version of what’s right and wrong. You kinda needed a more moral character like Renee Montoya – we needed a cop in there. Canary obviously is so crucial to the <i>Birds of Prey</i>, we really wanted to introduce her as well. And then Cas, Christina, the writer, and I actually spoke about a lot of our favorite films, and wanted to pay homage to a few things, but, <i>Leon: The Professional</i> was one of them, and we just loved that relationship – the, mentor and mentee, a very unexpected friendship there. We kind of found ourselves gravitating towards that as well.</blockquote>
      <p>But who is Leon in this situation? “I am,” Robbie responded. Naturally.</p>
      <p><i>Birds of Prey</i> is directed by <b>Cathy Yan</b> and written by Christina Hodson. The film flies into theaters on <b>February 7, 2020.</b></p>
