      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:00:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.icij.org/journalists/scilla-alecci/" target="_blank">Scilla Alecci</a></address>
      <p>Zumrat Dawut, a Uighur woman who said she spent three months in a detention camp, has spoken out about her experience in China’s internment camps in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>“I am now in a free world,” she told us. But others, including her family, remain inside the camps despite having committed no crime. “They do not have a voice. They cannot speak… So now I have the chance. And I choose to be their voice.”</p>
