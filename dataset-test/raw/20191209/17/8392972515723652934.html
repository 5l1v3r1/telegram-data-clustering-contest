      <h1>Prime Minister Boris Johnson 'looking at' getting rid of the BBC licence fee</h1>
      <h2>Could it be under threat?</h2>

      <p>As the build-up to Thursday's General Election continues, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has dropped a bombshell on the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, 55, asked a crowd during a stop in the northeast of England how long can [the BBC] justify the licence fee system, suggesting that the annual payment might be looked at closely if he retains power.</p>

      <p>The corporation came under fire earlier this year when it announced that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/piers-morgan-stanley-johnson-clash-on-gmb-tv-licence/">over 75s will have to pay for their licence fees from next year</a>.</p>
      <p>Today (9.12.19) Mr Johnson was asked what his opinion on the licence fee was.</p>
      <p>"Well, I don't think at this late stage in the campaign I'm going to make an unfunded spending commitment like that, but what I certainly think is that the BBC should cough up and pay for the licences for the over-75s as they promised to do," he replied.</p>
      <aside>But at this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licence fees, though I am certainly looking at it.</aside>

      <p>He continued: "But you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV, a media organisation still makes sense in the long-term given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves - that's all I will say.</p>
      <p>"I think that the system of funding by what is effectively a general tax, isn't it, everybody has a TV, it bears reflection - let me put it that way.</p>
      <p>"How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels - that is the question."</p>

      <p>Back in October, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/bbc-could-adopt-netflix-style-subscription-model/">was asked about the possibility of the Beeb changing from its current system to a subscription service</a>.</p>
      <p>She told the committee: "I would need to understand what that would do to their income. I think the BBC is a very important institution, it's an enormous part of our soft power around the world, but undoubtedly the sector is changing</p>
      <p>"We all know from streaming services and the way the younger generation consumes services, it is going to change."</p>
