      <h1>Jim O'Brien given all-clear to make Notts County return</h1>
      <h2>But Magpies boss Neal Ardley making sure midfielder's preparations are 'right'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:10:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Jim O’Brien has been given the all-clear to play for Notts County but boss Neal Ardley does not expect the midfielder to be firing on all cylinders.</p>
      <p>The Scotsman has been out of action since September when he broke his arm in a 2-1 defeat to Bromley which required surgery.</p>
      <p>O’Brien’s rehabilitation has gone well and he is now in a position where he is hoping to figure in the trip to Chesterfield in the FA Trophy at the weekend.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> says he is taking care with O’Brien’s preparations given his arm is still healing.            </p>
      <p>“We are trying to do the build-up right,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are hoping Jim can get back in. I don’t expect him to come back and hit the ground running.</p>
      <p>“He’s had a serious injury and a rod through his arm.</p>
      <p>“It’s not going to heal properly for a little while.</p>
      <p>“But he has been given the all-clear to play.”</p>
      <p>Should O’Brien be included for the trip to the Spireites he is likely to be one of several changes as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> look to make it through to the FA Trophy second round.</p>

      <p>It comes at a time when some Notts fans are eager to see Ardley tinker with his line-up having not won a league game since the end of October.</p>
      <p>The Notts boss says Saturday’s game will give players a chance to cause him a headache.</p>
      <p>“You are always an outstanding player and always needed when things aren’t going well,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That’s why people call for changes.</p>
      <p>“I was always the best player at Wimbledon when they weren’t winning and I was on the bench.</p>
      <p>“People say ‘once we get so and so back we will be okay’.</p>
      <p>“But some of them will get given an opportunity and have a chance to cause me a problem.”</p>
