      <p>Administration ally Senator Christopher “Bong” Go said on Monday that Manila Water Company, Inc. should be held liable for environmental damage because of their failure to construct a sewerage and wastewater system as stated in their contract.</p>

      <p>According to Go, Manila Water has yet to comply with its contractual obligation to provide for sewerage and wastewater treatment facilities in Metro Manila, clearly constituting a breach of the concession agreement.</p>
      <p>“Aside from that, they should also be charged not only for failing to deliver the terms of their contract, but also for the billions, if not trillions, worth of environmental damage caused by their failure to construct a sewerage and wastewater system,” Go said in a privilege speech during the Senate plenary session.</p>
      <p>Go said this is aside from the almost P1 billion worth of fines that the Supreme Court ordered them to pay last Aug. 2019 for violations related to the Philippine Clean Water Act.</p>
      <p>“So I will not be surprised if in the coming weeks, citizens will come together and file a Writ of Kalikasan class suit against these two water concessionaires,” said the senator.</p>
      <p>“Saan naman kayo nakakita ng kompanya na hindi pa man naisasagawa ang mismong septic tank desludging nito, nangongolekta na sila agad ng ‘environmental charge’ sa kanilang mga consumers para rito. Ano ito: pay now, service never (Where have you seen a company already collecting ‘environmental charges’ from consumers for septic tank desludging when they have not actually done anything yet. What is this: pay now, service never)?” he asked.</p>
      <p>Go earlier expressed his support of President Rodrigo Duterte’s decision to go after Manila Water and Maynilad Water Services, the two private water concessionaires in Metro Manila, for binding the hands of the government with their lopsided concessionaire agreement.</p>
      <p>The President’s anger stemmed from the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in Singapore ordering the Philippine government to pay Manila Water P7.39-billion for refusing to allow the company to implement the water rate increases they demanded in the past.</p>
      <p>Last year, the government was also ordered to pay Maynilad P3.4-billion by the same arbitral tribunal for the same reason.</p>
      <p>The senator said he stands with the President on the water issue because the use of water, as a basic human need, “should not be decided by those who make so much money at the expense of the very people who need it.”</p>
      <p>“Water is not only an economic resource, but also a natural resource for the benefit of all, administered and managed by the state. Water remains at the core of our nation’s survival. But these concessionaires act as if they have sovereignty over this resource, that government cannot interfere,” Go also said in his speech.</p>
      <p>“Akala siguro nila na candy lang ang binebenta nila (They probably think they are just selling candy). I would like to reiterate that water is a precious commodity and this should be accessible to all,” he pointed out.</p>
      <p>He also said that the government did not enter into these water agreements simply in the exercise of its propriety function, but also to exercise its governmental and state function to provide a fundamental public need.</p>
      <p>Go said that water consumers should not be made to bear the burden of the greed and selfishness of these big water concessionaires.</p>
      <p>“Mr. President, I am not and will never be against businesses or companies trying to turn a profit. In fact, I strongly believe that promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and fostering a country that is conducive for business and commerce are crucial in creating a better life for us all.</p>
      <p>“Pero bakit naman pati corporate income tax ninyo ipinapasa ninyo sa tao? Ito ay tunay na kalokohan (But why pass your corporate income tax to the people? This is truly nonsense),” he said.</p>
      <p>“Let me be clear: business without conscience is just greed,” Go said.</p>
