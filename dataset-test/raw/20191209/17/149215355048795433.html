      <p>Kentucky's new restrictions on abortion will be allowed to stand without further challenge.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-abortion-law-mandating-ultrasounds-n1098181?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">declined</a> to hear a challenge to the law requiring women see a fetal ultrasound and listen to a heartbeat before getting an abortion, giving no comment for its Monday decision.
