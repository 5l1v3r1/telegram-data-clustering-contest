      <h1>ACT pushes for national pill-testing after study finds it encouraged people to ditch unsafe drugs</h1>

      </p>
      <p>The Australian Capital Territory will continue to push for pill-testing nationally after an independent review confirmed a trial in Canberra <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/26/act-pill-testing-trial-found-seven-tablets-containing-drug-associated-with-deaths">encouraged </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/26/act-pill-testing-trial-found-seven-tablets-containing-drug-associated-with-deaths">buyers of a synthetic ecstasy substitute to ditch unsafe drugs</a>.</p>
      <p>The Australian National University evaluation of pill-testing at Groovin the Moo in April, released on Tuesday, declared the trial of 234 patrons a success because “all those who had a very dangerous substance detected disposed of that drug in the amnesty bin”.</p>
      <p>The study found all seven festival patrons whose pills were found to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/29/pill-testing-at-groovin-the-moo-festival-potentially-saves-seven-lives-organisers-say">contain the highly toxic chemical N-Ethylpentylone</a>, a drug sold as MDMA and associated with deaths in the US and New Zealand, disposed of their drugs.</p>
      <p>It found that more than 40% of patrons who used the service said they intended to reduce the quantity of drugs they would use (28%), not use them at all, or have only alcohol (13%).</p>
      <p>The ACT health and youth minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, said she would bring the results to the next health ministers’ meeting in 2020 because governments have a responsibility “to not only try and prevent drug use but also to support initiatives that reduce the harms associated with drug use”.</p>
      <p>“I hope all states and territories consider these findings seriously,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Across the country we have seen too many avoidable deaths at music festivals. It is obvious current processes and policies are not working and more needs to be done.”</p>
      <p>In neighbouring New South Wales, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/15/nsw-coroner-to-recommend-pill-testing-be-introduced-at-music-festivals">a coronial inquest into drug-related festival deaths has called for pill-testing</a> to be introduced permanently, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/16/nsw-premier-dismisses-coroners-call-for-pill-testing-before-report-is-publicly-released">the call was rebuffed by the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian</a>, who claims it gives potential drug users a “a false sense of security”. Victoria has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/05/new-pill-testing-push-as-mother-of-drug-victim-urges-premier-to-act-for-greater-good">also rejected calls for a trial</a>.</p>
      <p>The ANU study found most patrons who presented a sample believed they had MDMA (89.5%), and 91% of them were correct.</p>
      <p>“When a patron was told that their drug was not what they expected it to be, they were less likely to take that drug,” it said.</p>
      <p>“When a patron was told that their drug was what they expected it to be, they were more likely to take that drug.”</p>
      <p>Despite the fact more than 40% planned to reduce or not use drugs, 19% reported that they planned to use the same amount and 8% said they would use more of the drug than originally planned. One quarter (26%) were not sure how the test results would influence their intentions.</p>
      <p>The lead researcher, Anna Olsen, said the fact the service led to harm reduction behaviours among patrons was a key marker of success, including disposing of highly dangerous drugs when they were identified.</p>
      <p>“And for people who go on to take the drug they had tested, we found evidence for risk-reducing behaviours such as taking less of the drug, spacing out their drug consumption and taking other safety precautions like drinking lots of water,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Our evaluation team applauds the ACT government for showing such leadership on this issue and the open-mindedness and willingness to work with the relevant experts and services to trial this service, building the evidence base for policymaking in this space.”</p>
      <p>The study found the trial produced “valuable information about illicit drug availability”, including identification of N-Ethylpentylone, a substance “previously unidentified in the ACT”, and confirmation of increased prevalence and purity of MDMA in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/canberra">Canberra</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/20/pill-testing-success-in-act-proves-it-should-go-national-organisers-say">first trial of pill-testing in April 2018</a> had similarly positive results, with 30% of respondents suggesting they would not take drugs or take fewer as a result.</p>
