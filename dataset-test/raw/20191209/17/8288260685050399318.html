      <p>Aston Villa have had their relegation odds slashed, following back-to-back Premier League defeats.</p>
      <p>After picking up a point against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Villa were 3/1 to be relegated back to the Championship.</p>
      <p>However, after a 2-1 loss to Chelsea and a thumping 4-1 reversal vs Leicester City, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> are now third favourites for the drop at <b>9/4.</b></p>

      <p>They are out of the relegation zone only on goal difference, with Southampton, Norwich and Watford, currently occupying the bottom three.</p>
      <p>Following the defeat to the Foxes, Dean Smith's men face a pivotal run of fixtures, where they will play Sheffield United and the three teams below them before 2019 draws to an end.</p>
