      <p>Marikina City students wearing colorful and festive costumes performed various festival dances of several regions in the country at the Marikina Sports Center, showcasing the culture and tradition of each region.</p>
      <p>Among the dances showcased during the festivities were the Bangus Festival, Sinulog Festival, Ati-Atihan Festival, Kadayawan Festival, and Panagbenga Festival among other festival dances.</p>
      <p>In his message, Marikina City Mayor Marcelino “Marcy” Teodoro said that there was now a wider definition of becoming a Marikeño, saying that the love for the city was what truly defines a Marikeño.</p>
      <p>“Sinasabi ng iba, ang taga-Marikina ay may disiplina, may mabuting ugali, may pagpapahalaga sa pamilya,” Teodoro said.</p>
      <p>“Ngunit, ang pinaka nasa sentro ng lahat ay ang pagmamahal para sa Bayan ng Marikina. Ang makita ang sarili bilang isang bahagi ng bayang ito, at nakikibahagi sa mga taong naririto, at sa kwento nito,” he noted.</p>
      <p>According to the mayor, at least 70 percent of the total number of residents in the city are migrants from other provinces.</p>
      <p>“We, in Marikina, an urbanized city, 70 percent of our residents are already migrants—from other provinces or regions. We celebrate life together as a community in Marikina,” Teodoro said.</p>
      <p>Marikina’s Rehiyon-Rehiyon Festival is celebrated every December 8 to give honor to migrants from different regions in the country and have chosen to stay in Marikina and contributed to the development of the city. The festivities coincides with Marikina’s cityhood anniversary.</p>
      <p>Among the foreign delegates that joined the festival were Mayor Masahiro Sashimoto of Sakai City, Japan, and other delegations from Sakai, which is a sister city of Marikina.</p>
      <p>On December 8, 1996, President Fidel V. Ramos, through the Republic Act 8223, transformed Marikina from a humble municipality in the far east of Metro Manila to a well-developed and highly urbanized city.</p>
