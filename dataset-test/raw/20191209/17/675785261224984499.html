      <p>One person described how he he would pay $5 "towards the next person's groceries" whenever he came into their store to buy something.</p>
      <p>"He had the kindest heart, it was never about him, he definitely created a ripple affect of happiness to others," they wrote.</p>
      <p>Another wrote how Hayden was "an absolute spectacular human, likely to have saved many lives on that island today because he was that kinda person."</p>

      <p>Paul Quinn, Chairman for White Island Tours, said: “Devastation is an understatement. This is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been impacted.”</p>
      <p>There are fears for the lives of 24 other people including four Brits after the volcano erupted as tourists walked around the site in Bay of Plenty today.</p>
      <p>The missing people were said to be mainly foreign tourists with many from a visiting cruise ship, the Ovation of the Seas.</p>
      <p>Horrifying webcam images showed holidaymakers and guides standing in the crater moments before the eruption hit White Island.</p>

      <p>Four Britons are listed as "missing" on a Red Cross list, which allows family and friends concerned about loved ones to register an inquiry.</p>
      <p>Authorities have there is no sign of life on the island, also known as Whakaari, following flyovers late on Monday local time.</p>
      <p>Anyone who could have been could have taken alive from the island would have been rescued already, they believe.</p>
