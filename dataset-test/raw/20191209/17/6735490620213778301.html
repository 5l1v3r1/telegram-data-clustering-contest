      <p>“‘Ubuntu’ is a Xhosa word…It means ‘humanity,’ direct translation,” a voiceover says. “So basically, you’ll always need the next person. You know what I mean? So one hand washes the other, the one hand does need the other to clean. That is Ubuntu. To help others, your brothers, your sisters. Even when they are strangers and you don’t know them, you are supposed to help them.”</p>
      <p>Coldplay’s double album <i>Everyday Life</i> is available now.</p>
