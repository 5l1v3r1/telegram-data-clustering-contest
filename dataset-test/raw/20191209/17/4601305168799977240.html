      <p>The above GIF was created from new 3D scans of the bullets that killed president John F. Kennedy. The GIF shows two bits of the bullets that killed the president along with another mostly complete bullet plucked from Texas Governor John Connally's hospital stretcher. The National Archives temporarily removed the historic projectiles from the vault so that the National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/kennedy-assassination-bullets-preserved-digital-form">could create digital replicas</a> of them at microscopic resolution. Next year, the digital replicas will become part of the National Archive's <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk">JFK Assassination Records</a> publicly available online. From <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/bullets-killed-kennedy-immortalized-digital-replicas-180973714/">Smithsonian</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>These bullets now enter the National Archives’ digital collection alongside three others thought to hail from the same firearm: two discharged as test shots, and another from an earlier failed assassination attempt on Army Major General Edwin Walker. All were imaged with a specialized microscope that scanned their surfaces, charting their features much like a satellite recording the topography of a mountain range. The pictures were then stitched together by NIST ballistics specialists to generate a vivid 3-D rendering detailed enough to show grooves left by the barrel of the gun.</blockquote>
