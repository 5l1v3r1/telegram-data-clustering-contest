      <p>The Totnes Christmas market has been cancelled due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain and high winds has been forecast by the Met Office from roughly 9am onwards - and organisers have taken the pre-emptive decision to cancel the popular attraction.</p>
      <p>The indoor craft market which was set for the Civic Hall has been postponed and will now be next Tuesday instead.</p>

      <p>On its Facebook page, Totnes Christmas Festival Nights said it was 'feeling heartbroken' before adding: “It’s bad news folks. With a heavy heart the council has taken the decision to cancel tomorrow’s Christmas Festival event (Tuesday 10th December 2019) due to adverse weather.</p>
      <p>“The indoor craft market in the Civic Hall will also move to next Tuesday.”</p>
      <p>The news has been met with disappointment - and represents a blow to the South Hams town.</p>
      <p>Thousands had attended the town's first Christmas market, with late-night shopping, music and food stalls.</p>
      <p>As well as heavy rain, the Met Office has also predicted winds of up to 28mph.</p>

      <p>It will be a 'wet and windy day with spells of rain, perhaps heaviest and more persistent later on'.</p>
      <p>There is still one more Christmas market planned for Tuesday, December 17 - and organisers have urged people to spread the word.</p>
      <p>“We are determined to make the 17th an extravaganza though! If you know of people planning to come, please share this message with them," said the organisers.</p>
      <p>They then added: "Folks don't forget, just because there aren't any stalls doesn't mean the town is closed! This would be an amazing opportunity to come and see the incredible range of shops that are here year round!</p>
      <p>"From food, drinks, fashion, art and crafts, Totnes is the town to find that perfect gift."</p>
