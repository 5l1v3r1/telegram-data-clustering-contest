      <p>Blac Chyna managed to worry some of her fans following a post that she shared on her social media account. In the recent message that Chyna posted, she says she is looking for collaborations.</p>

      <p>A follower posted this: â€˜Someone is broke broke lol. Celebs dont post these messages,â€™ and another follower said: â€˜I already know this is gonna be an expensive investment. ðŸ’¯â€™</p>
      <p>One other of her fans asked Chyna: â€˜Are you in some kind trouble, money-related?â€™ and another Instagrammer exclaimed: â€˜Omg how embarrassing for her.â€™</p>
      <p>Somoene else said: â€˜Maybe not promo, but Iâ€™d love to Collab on some full-spectrum cannabis products with you one day @blacchyna.â€™</p>
      <p>Anyway, there were a lot of people who seemed to feel sorry for Chyna and lots of others who offered their services.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, itâ€™s pretty hard to believe that Chyna is broke, according to some of her fansâ€™ opinions.</p>
      <p>Not too long ago, Chyna made headlines once again when her former pal asked her mom, Tokyo Toni, to stop bullying her.</p>

      <p>It was revealed that Treasure Gemz and Chyna were friends for over a decade until they parted ways on her reality show. Recently, <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/blac-chynas-former-friend-treasure-begs-tokyo-toni-to-stop-bullying-her-348864/">Treasure was asking Chynaâ€™s mom to stop bullying her</a>.</p>
