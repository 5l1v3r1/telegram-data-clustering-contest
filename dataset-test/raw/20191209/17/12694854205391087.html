        <b>Hold the phone, BioShock is coming back! 2K Games have launched a new game development studio called Cloud Chamber and they’re going to make a new BioShock game. </b>
      </p>
      <p>There hasn’t been a new entry to the series since 2013’s BioShock Infinite. The game got fantastic reviews, bagging several 10/10’s, and was released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360.</p>
      <p>Now, Cloud Chamber has been formed to step into some big, big shoes. Let’s hope they can build on the series’ reputation and give gamers an up-to-the-minute return to the atmospheric BioShock world.</p>

      <p>Kelley Gilmore, Global Studio Head, Cloud Chamber, said: “We founded Cloud Chamber to create yet-to-be-discovered worlds… that push the boundaries of what is possible in the video game medium.</p>
      <p>“Our team believes in the beauty and strength of diversity, in both the makeup of the studio and the nature of its thinking. We are a deeply experienced group of game makers, including many responsible for <i>BioShock</i>’s principal creation, advancement and longstanding notoriety, and honoured to be part of the 2K family as stewards of this iconic franchise.”</p>
      <p>2K see the revival of the franchise as a fantastic business opportunity. BioShock was popular enough to spawn two sequels, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite.</p>
      <p>Cloud Chamber are set to be based between 2K’s San Francisco headquarters and a location in Montreal, Canada. Notably, this will be 2K’s first Canadian office.</p>
      <p>2K President, David Ismailer, said: “As we continue growing our product portfolio, we remain inspired by opportunities to invest further in our valuable IP, great people and their collective, long-term potential. BioShock<i> </i>is one of the most beloved, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation. We can’t wait to see where its powerful narrative and iconic, first-person shooter gameplay head in the future with our new studio team at Cloud Chamber leading the charge.”</p>
