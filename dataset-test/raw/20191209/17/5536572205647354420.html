      <h1>REPORT: NFL Not Interested In Reseeding Playoff Teams Despite Embarrassing NFC East Division</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:30:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>The NFC East is a dumpster fire that doesn’t have a single team above .500. The worst part in this is that the winner of the division will get a home game against a much better team in the postseason.</p>
      <p>It’s a situation that has people wanting the league to take action and think about possibly reseeding the playoff teams.</p>
      <p>However, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28247371/source-reseeding-playoff-teams-never-consideration-nfl">ESPN’s Adam Schefter</a>, the popularity of that idea hasn’t spread farther than fans or the media.</p>
      <blockquote>“A source with knowledge of the NFL’s thinking said the idea of reseeding teams has come up but “has gotten zero steam. It’s never been a consideration.”</blockquote>
      <p>The report does not elaborate on why the NFL hasn’t considered it, but it’s not like this would be the first time a bad team made into the postseason.</p>
      <p>The 7-9 Seahawks made it there with a 7-9 record and defeated the New Orleans Saints in a game that is best remembered for Marshawn Lynch putting the team on his back with a monster run.</p>
