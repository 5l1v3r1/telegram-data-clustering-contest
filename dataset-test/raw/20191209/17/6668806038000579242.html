      <p>Without taking a moment Bebo agreed to this and said AK was the first one to know about their romance and did a good job of keeping it a secret for a long time. To which Akshay responded, “Well I came to know because Saif’s room was next to mine.”</p>
      <p>This little revelation about Saif’s room made the audience break out in long laugh and made Kareena blush.</p>
