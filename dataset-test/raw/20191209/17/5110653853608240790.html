      <h1>Travis Konecny injury update: Philadelphia Flyers forward out indefinitely with concussion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:08:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy McArdle</a></address>
      <p>The Philadelphia Flyers on Monday announced Travis Konecny <a href="https://twitter.com/NHLFlyers/status/1204074529703841792">will be out indefinitely with a concussion</a> he sustained on Dec. 7 in a violent collision with Ottawa Senators defenseman Mark Borowiecki.</p>
      <p>Late in the game's first period, Borowiecki caught Konecny up high in the neutral zone just after the 22-year-old star deflected a pass into Phladelphia's attacking zone. Konecny remained on the ice for a few minutes before leaving under his own power and exiting to the Flyers locker room.</p>

      <p>The play instigated a series of hard-hitting body checks between both teams that culminated with two fights;Jakub Vorachek and Nick Paul dropped the gloves at the end of the first period and Flyers rookie Joel Farabee earned his first career fight against Jean-Gabriel Pageau.</p>
      <p>No penalty was called on the play. Borowiecki also left the game briefly, but he returned during the second period.</p>
      <p>Konecny had scored his 11th goal of the season to open the game's scoring early in the first period. He now has 28 points in 30 games played — which leads all Philadelphia forwards.</p>

      <p>After the game, the Flyers confirmed Konecny had <a href="https://twitter.com/NHLFlyers/status/1203420023211122688">suffered an upper-body injury</a> but declined to provide a further update until Monday's announcement. The Courier-Post's Dave Isaac reported Monday that while Philadelphia does not yet plan on bringing Konecny along for its three-game road trip between Dec. 11 and Dec. 15, head coach Alain Vigneault <a href="https://twitter.com/davegisaac/status/1204079800329134080">acknowledged that could still change</a>.</p>
      <p>“He’s been our best scorer and he’s found a way to contribute offensively and defensively," Vigneault <a href="https://twitter.com/NHLFlyers/status/1204080915695243265">said of Konecny via Twitter</a>. "We were using him five-on-five and the PP. It’s going to give the opportunity to someone else to see more ice time and step up and contribute."</p>
      <p>Konecny was in the midst of a breakout season four years into his NHL career. His loss comes as a significant blow to a Philadelphia team that sits in third place in the Metropolitan Division (39 points) through Dec. 8, on track to return to the playoffs after missing out on the postseason last year.</p>
