      <p>As Film Twitter quarrels over who or what did or didn’t get nominated for a certain award, it’s always a refreshing breath of air towards the end of the year to get the annual video countdown from David Ehrlich. Both a celebration of the year in cinema as well as an excellent list of films to seek out if one hasn’t yet, 2019’s edition is no different.</p>
