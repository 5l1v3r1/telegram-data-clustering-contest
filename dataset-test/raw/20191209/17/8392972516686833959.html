      <p>Carrot farmer Alastair Ferguson explained that a wet autumn has meant they have an abundance of wonky carrots.</p>
      <p>He said: "We’ve plenty of standard carrots for Christmas dinner – but also have a lot of wonky carrots."</p>

      <p>Alastair added: "Carrots for Rudolph is helpful because it introduces customers to wonky veg, finds these carrots a home and stops them being wasted."</p>
      <p>Morrisons sells 1.6 million bags of carrots in the last three weeks before Christmas.</p>
      <p>However, wonky carrots only account for between ten and 15 per cent of these.</p>
