      <p>A raccoon was shot dead after getting drunk on mulled wine and passing out at a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/christmas-market">Christmas market</a> in Germany, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>The racoon is said to have gotten hold of the alcohol after sipping mulled wine leftover from glasses in the Erfurt market.</p>
      <p>A local police spokesman said the raccoon was “obviously intoxicated,” but a “breathalyzer test on the animal was not carried out”, according to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/german">German</a> broadcaster <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/drunken-raccoon-staggers-through-german-christmas-market-passes-out/a-51579948">DW News.</a></p>
      <p>Video footage shows the raccoon stumbling around, playing with a woman’s shoes and then sleeping on a step, as Christmas revellers film the drunken creature while laughing.</p>
      <p>Sadly, although initial reports indicated the raccoon was taken to an animal shelter, the case was instead handed over to a local hunter who shot the creature dead.</p>
      <p>Animal rescue SWE Tierheim Erfurt tweeted: “Unfortunately, the story of the drunken raccoon did not have a happy ending.</p>
      <p>“The city hunter took him away and shot him dead.”</p>
      <p>Raccoons are not protected by conservation laws in Germany and people can legally hunt them, according to <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Finternational%2Fgermany%2Fgermany-overrun-by-raccoon-invasion-a-847847.html&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/raccoon-drunk-shot-christmas-market-mulled-wine-germany-hunter-a9239291.html">Spiegel Online.</a></p>
      <p>In 2018, police officers in Germany picked up two drunk hedgehogs near Erfurt’s cathedral.</p>
      <p>It is believed they had come across discarded bottles of alcoholic eggnog and they were taken to the zoo to receive care.</p>
