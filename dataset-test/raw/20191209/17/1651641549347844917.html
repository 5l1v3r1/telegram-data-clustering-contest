      <p>Based on the feedback from Wunderlist users, Microsoft has made several changes and additions to To Do app experience. For example, the latest design of To Do app looks and feels similar to Wunderlist. In addition to all the features that were available on Wunderlist, Microsoft To Do app comes with several brand new features such as My Day, Planned Lists, Dark mode, list groups, Planner and Outlook integration and more.</p>
