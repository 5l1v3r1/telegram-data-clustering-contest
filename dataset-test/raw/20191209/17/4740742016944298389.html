      <h1>Uber offering all NHS staff free rides or Uber Eats meals this Christmas - how it works</h1>
      <h2>More than 400,000 NHS staff spent Christmas Day last year caring for patients</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:41:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Conor Gogarty</a></address>
      <p>Ride-hailing app Uber is offering all <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> staff two free trips over the festive period.</p>
      <p>And the firm's food delivery platform, Uber Eats, has given the alternative of two free meals for NHS workers who do not need the rides.</p>
      <p>Between December 23 and 27, staff can get two trips, each worth £10, for free. Alternatively they can opt for two Uber Eats meals, each worth £10.</p>
      <p>Uber’s European boss Jamie Heywood said: “We all know someone who works tirelessly over <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> to keep the NHS running and this is our way of saying thank you.</p>
      <p>"For the third year, we’re offering NHS doctors, nurses and support staff a helping hand to get to and from work at Christmas time, when public transport is limited.</p>
      <p>"This year, it’s fantastic to extend the offer to provide a free meal to help make those shifts a little easier."</p>
      <p>More than 400,000 NHS staff spent Christmas Day last year caring for patients.</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>NHS staff should visit <a href="http://www.uber.com/nhs"><u>www.uber.com/nhs</u></a> and enter their work email address into the form before December 20.</p>
      <p>Uber says: "We need your NHS email to verify whether you qualify for this festive promotion, but don’t worry, it will only be used for the purposes of this offer.</p>
      <p>"If you don’t already have the Uber or Uber Eats app, you can download it from the App Store or Play Store, otherwise, simply open the Uber app.</p>
      <p>"Tap the menu in the top left corner of your screen and select ‘Payment’. You can then select ‘Add promo code’ towards the bottom of the menu and add each code you’ve been sent.</p>
      <p>"You can now either enjoy 2 x £10 trips or 2 x £10 off your next Uber Eats order. Whichever offer you choose, your codes must be redeemed between 12am on December 23 and 11.59pm on December 27."</p>
