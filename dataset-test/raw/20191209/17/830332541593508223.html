      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The head of the Wisconsin National Guard says all recommendations made following an investigation into multiple reports of sexual assault and harassment will be implemented.</p>

      <p>Gov. Tony Evers and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin requested the probe by the National Guard Bureau's Office of Complex Investigations.</p>
      <p>Dunbar says his team is in the process of reviewing the report and "we intend to implement all of the recommendations." He says sexual misconduct has no place in the Wisconsin National Guard.</p>
