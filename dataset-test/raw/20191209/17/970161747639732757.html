      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's James Haskell shows off 'jungle wife' Caitlyn Jenner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:21:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">James Besanvalle</a></address>
      <p>After <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here</a> wrapped up last night, camp mates <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> wasted no time in letting loose and having some fun.</p>
      <p>The stars celebrated fellow camp mate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a>’s win in style, posting a cute selfie with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> while on set for the finale.</p>
      <p>Then, swapping the khaki out for some truly stylish glad rags, they posed together in front of the hotel’s pool.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn wore a fitted red dress with a matching choker, while – not to be upstaged – James rocked a navy suit.</p>
      <p>And just when we thought they couldn’t be cuter, James matched the colour of his tie with Caitlyn’s dress (we’ll give him the benefit of the doubt on this one, in case it was just a happy coincidence).</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/07/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-secretly-met-jungle-husband-james-haskell-bridge-family-snub-exit-reunion-11407915/">James met Caitlyn at the end of the jungle reunion bridge</a>, right after she was eliminated from the show.</p>

      <p>But don’t worry, James has also showered some love on his actual wife too.</p>
      <p>Taking to his Instagram stories, he posted a video of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chloe-madeley/">Chloe Madeley</a> with Jacqueline’s winning jungle staff.</p>
      <p>Unsure if her hubby is taking a video or photo, Chloe mimed stamping the staff on the ground. Then after realising it is indeed a video, she quoted the iconic Lord Of The Rings line: ‘You shall not pass!’</p>
      <p>James lovingly mocked: ‘There’s something very wrong with you.’</p>
      <p>He managed to redeem himself though – following the video up with a photo and the caption: ‘Love her so much.’</p>

      <p>The fun didn’t stop there, as it looked like she stole Jacqueline’s jungle victory crown a bit later on in the evening.</p>
      <p>‘I’m really excited,’ James explained, as he talked to the camera. ‘I’m here with the queen of the jungle.’</p>
      <p>He then panned the camera to Chloe and screamed: ‘Sorry what? You’re not the… get it off!’</p>
      <p>Chloe then joked: ‘Thank you guys for voting, I really appreciate it. I feel fantastic!’</p>
