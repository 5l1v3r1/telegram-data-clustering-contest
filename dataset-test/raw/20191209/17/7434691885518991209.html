      <h1>A geek-themed bakery is about to open on Queen West</h1>
      <h2>The Grand Order of Divine Sweets (aka The GOoDS) will start serving up chocolate Xenomorph eggs and TARDIS treats this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:02:09+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Natalia Manzocco</a></address>
      <p>If you've got the kind of sweet tooth that only a chocolate carbonite-coated Han Solo, TARDIS-shaped bon bon or Poké Ball truffle can satisfy, your hour has come: A nerdy-themed cafe is opening in the heart of Queen West later this week.</p>
      <p>Joining <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/food-and-drink/food/toronto-gets-a-harry-potter-themed-bar/">The Lockhart</a>, The Sidekick, <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/food-and-drink/food/nerd-bar-storm-crow-manor-opens-in-toronto/">Storm Crow Manor</a> and See-Scape in the local nerdy dining establishment pantheon, <a href="https://thegoodsweets.com/">The Grand Order of Divine Sweets</a> (also known as The GOoDS) is about to open at 1162 Queen West (at Beaconsfield) on December 12.</p>
      <p>The business – the brainchild of Samantha Lapointe, the owner of now-shuttered bakery Cakes Cove, and Meridith Braun, a gaming industry veteran – offers a wide variety of "fandom-inspired desserts", from Hoth chocolate to Xenomorph mint eggs.</p>
      <p>To kick things off, The GOoDS is hosting a promo called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5lWDAFHhQC/">12 Days of Geekmas</a>, which will see a new slate of nerdy specials every day starting on opening day. December 14, meanwhile, is their grand opening event, which promises cosplay appearances, a Baby Yoda* cake, and "a chance to eat the universe". (We're listening...)</p>
