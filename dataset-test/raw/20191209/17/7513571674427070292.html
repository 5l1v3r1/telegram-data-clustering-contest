        <b>President Muhammadu Buhari will depart Abuja on Tuesday for Aswan, Egypt to attend a meeting designed to set “an agenda for sustainable peace and development in Africa.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, made this known in a statement on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The initiative is being launched by the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in his capacity as the Chairman of the African Union (AU) and as an advocate of Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development in Africa – a recurring theme of his tenure as the AU Chairman,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>“It is also grounded in the AU’s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and the search for African solutions to African problems.</p>
      <p>“The gathering is expected to bring together heads of state and government, leaders from regional and international organisations, financial institutions, private sector and civil societies.</p>
      <p>”(Others are) scholars, visionaries and prominent experts for action-oriented discussions on the threats, challenges, and opportunities.</p>
      <p>“It is also expected to end with a Declaration on the theme of the Forum and become an annual event.”</p>
      <p>Ali Abdel Aal , speaker of Egypt’s house of representatives, had delivered el-Sisi’s message to Buhari in Abuja in October while inviting him to the inaugural Aswan forum.</p>
      <p>Adesina said the president will be accompanied by Ahmadu Fintiri, governor of Adamawa state, Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo, and Mai Mala Buni, governor of Yobe.</p>
      <p>Others in Buhari’s delegation are Bashir Magashi, minister of defence; Zubairu Dada, minister of state, foreign affairs; Babagana Monguno, national security adviser, and the Ahmed Abubakar, director-general of national intelligence agency.</p>
      <p>The president is expected back in Abuja on Friday.</p>
