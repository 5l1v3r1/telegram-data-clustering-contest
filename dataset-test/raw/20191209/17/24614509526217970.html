      <h1>Under $3, Plug Power Stock Is a Good Speculative Buy</h1>
      <h2>The speculative dream stock has fallen 21% since the end of November</h2>

      <p><b>Plug Power </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/plug-stock-quote/"><b><u>PLUG</u></b></a>) was doing just fine in November, finishing the month up 47%. Then it announced it was making a secondary offering to sell up to 40 million shares of PLUG stock, and the wheels fell off.</p>

      <p>Down 21% in four days of trading, it’s clear investors don’t like the idea of the company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1093691/000104746919006583/a2240206z424b5.htm">diluting Plug Power stock by 17%</a>. If you’re a speculative investor, the secondary offering comes dressed like an opportunity. </p>
      <p>If PLUG drops below $3 and you don’t need the money for your kid’s college fund, this might be the ticket you’ve been looking for. </p>
      <p>For anyone who’s saving for retirement, you can ignore the rest of this article. PLUG stock is not for you. </p>
      <h3>A Smaller Piece of the Pie</h3>
      <p>One of the reasons that Warren Buffett likes share repurchases at the companies whose stocks <b>Berkshire Hathaway </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/brk.a-stock-quote/"><b><u>BRK.A</u></b></a>, NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/brk.b-stock-quote/"><b><u>BRK.B</u></b></a>) owns is he gets a bigger piece of the pie every time they buy back stock. Fewer shares mean a bigger ownership stake. </p>
      <p>Conversely, Buffett wouldn’t be too enamored with a stock in his portfolio if it made a 40-million secondary offering that reduced his piece of the pie by 17%. He’d be downright aggravated. </p>
      <p>However, the speculative punter doesn’t have any such concern. You’re merely trying to profit from big moves in a low-priced stock. These are quick hits that line your pocket. Of course, if you sell before the year is up, your capital gains tax is higher, but that’s another subject. </p>
      <p>Plug Power has done secondary offerings before. </p>
      <p>In 2014, <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/2014/04/plug-power-inc-prices-its-secondary-offering-shares-tank/">it sold 22.6 million shares</a> of Plug Power stock for $5.50 a share with a 30-day option for underwriters to buy another 15% or 3.4 million shares. Predictably, its stock fell more than 6% on April 25, 2014, on the news. </p>
      <p>The company had initially planned to sell 15 million shares in the secondary offering. Still, the demand was so strong that it upped the size of the offering, raising $116 million in net proceeds. Plug Power used what was raised for working capital and acquisitions. </p>
      <p>I wonder if any of those buyers are still holding PLUG stock? I expect not.</p>
      <p>As a speculative investor, you’ve got to consider whether the latest move lower is a routine correction that happens when companies issue more stock or the start of a much more significant decline. </p>
      <h3>Third-Quarter Bust</h3>
      <p>Plug Power reported Q3 2019 earnings on Nov. 7. The company missed slightly on both the top and bottom line. Analysts were expecting a 6-cent loss; it delivered an 8-cent loss. On the top line, Plug Power’s revenues were $56.4 million, 1.6% shy of the consensus estimate. </p>
      <p>Neither miss was terrible, which is probably why its stock continued to move higher through the remainder of November. However, the fact that it had a third-quarter loss that was 14% higher over last year should concern anyone who believes in the company’s $1-billion goal for revenues by 2024 and non-GAAP or possibly even non-GAAP annual profitability. </p>
      <p>At the end of October, I suggested that <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/10/plug-powers-ambitious-billion-dollar-plan-is-one-of-two-things/">Plug Power’s ambitious goal</a> was either a winning call or another opportunity to disappoint PLUG shareholders. The third-quarter results have done little to sway me in either direction. </p>
      <p><i>InvestorPlace’s</i> Vince Martin recently put into perspective what the secondary offering says about the company’s business.</p>
      <blockquote>“The offering is a sign that the company still has many of the problems of <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/12/plug-power-delivering-plug-stock-rising/">the ‘old’ Plug Power</a>, a company in which investors showed little confidence,” Martin wrote Dec. 4. “Better results in 2018-2019 don’t completely erase the memory of disappointments of 1999-2017. Debt remains a problem. Financing is only available at double-digit interest rates, or through dilution of existing shareholders.”</blockquote>
      <p>That pretty much sums up the ongoing vulnerabilities faced by Plug Power as it continues to push its hydrogen fuel cells to big business. </p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line on PLUG Stock</h3>
      <p>As my colleague alluded to in his article about the company, Plug Power remains a speculative dream stock because the rewards for hitting $1 billion in revenue by 2024 are so tremendous. </p>
      <p>If you’re a speculative investor, under $3 seems like a great place to buy.</p>
