      <h1>Report: Florida State Makes Offensive Coordinator Hire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:18:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Newly-minted Florida State head coach Mike Norvell is wasting no time putting his coaching staff together. It’s only his first day on the job and he’s already picked out his offensive coordinator.</p>
      <p>According to Pete Thamel of Yahoo! Sports, Florida State is hiring Auburn offensive coordinator Kenny Dillingham to fill the same role with the ‘Noles. 247Sports <a href="https://twitter.com/bmarcello/status/1204082169452339200">has confirmed</a> the news.</p>
      <p>Dillingham is in his first year with Auburn after previously working under Norvell at Memphis, and at Arizona State before that. In 2017, he served as quarterbacks and tight ends coach, and helped put together an offense that set numerous school records moving the ball.</p>

      <p>But this past year might have been Dillingham’s best job of all.</p>
      <p>With a freshman quarterback in Bo Nix, Dillingham helped put together an offense that averaged 34.0 points per game, and was good enough to outgun the likes of Oregon and Alabama.</p>
      <p>The Tigers went 9-3 and are set to play in the Outback Bowl against Minnesota on New Year’s Day.</p>
      <p>Considering that nailing the quarterback position has been a critical problem for the Noles these past few years, getting someone who has proven to turn offenses around with young quarterbacks has to have fans excited.</p>
