      <p>TURTLECREEK TWP. — The Cincinnati Zoo and Miami Valley Gaming racino are both moving forward with big expansions in Warren County.</p>
      <p>The zoo plans to add an outdoor education center, trail system and solar array.</p>
      <p>As previously announced, the racino operators are planning a 11-story, 194-room hotel, 12,000 square foot gaming expansion, 7,500 square foot restaurant expansion and 1,000 space parking garage.</p>
      <p>Both projects are just east of I-75, off Ohio 63 in Turtlecreek Twp.</p>
      <p>The Warren County Board of Commissioners is scheduled to review site plans for the zoo and racino projects on Tuesday.</p>
