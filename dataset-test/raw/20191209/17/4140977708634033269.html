          <p>Where matches of such stature are ardently awaited in the Premier League, the kind of football both these clubs from London have doled out this season makes this a potentially drab affair. Both West Ham and Arsenal have indulged in horrid seasons, ones which see both the units struggling and floundering in the points tally ahead of today’s imminent encounter.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately for either side, this is not the first season they have had to indulge in abject campaigns. And both the sides have issues akin to each other, both struggling due to a dismal structure at the club paired with players who have been disinterested to wrench out of the impasse they are immersed in.</p>

                <p>It’s a peril whish has in particular shrouded this Arsenal unit, a side which has failed to overhaul its underachieving run of from despite a change of manager. Things have failed to change under the leadership of Freddie Lunjberg for the club with the side falling to a horrid 2-1 defeat against Brighton the last time around, a performance which clearly emphasised how torrid a side Arsenal are this term.</p>
                <p>Where Arsenal are in 11th place, West Ham find themselves in 16th with the club mustering up the sole win in their five matches. Defeated 2-0 by Wolverhampton the last time around, the side find themselves on the brink of the relegation spots but what will buoy them today though is that their most recent win came in a reminiscent derby against Chelsea, a performance the side will be looking to emulate today.</p>

                            <p>
                              <b>West Ham United</b>
                            </p>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>Freekick And Corner Taker</h3>
                            <p>
                              <b>West Ham United</b>
                            </p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                              <b>Arsenal</b>
                            </p>

                              <li>Mesut Ozil</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Bygone Contest</h3>
                            <p>Wolverhampton Vs West Ham: 2-0</p>
                            <p>Arsenal Vs Brighton: 1-2</p>
                            <h3>WHU Vs ARS Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Although West Ham look extremely unlikely to pull off a win today, we are going to still rope in their shot stopper for this match. The cleansheet David Martin got against Chelsea was one which epitomised his calibre as a goal-keeper with us envisaging him pulling off a slew of saves come today’s imminent tie as well.</p>
                            <h3>WHU Vs ARS Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Ryan Fredericks from West Ham becomes the first player to be brought in by us owing to his capabilities as an attacking defender. This is a match between two sides who have shipped the 48 goals in 30 matches in between them, a number which clearly alludes to how disgruntled and despondent these two units have made as defensive setups.</p>
                            <p>It’s a narrative which clearly exults towards the fact that this clash is not going to give us a cleansheet from either side, seeing us restrict our picks to the bare minimum of three players. Elsewhere from arsenal, we have decided to move in with both Kieran Tierney and Sead Kolasinac for this encounter owing to their willingness to make cantering down the park.</p>
                            <h3>WHU Vs ARS Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>After a riveting start to the season, Andriy Yarmolenko has massively regressed in form much like his side. Its lead to him falling out of favour as well but we envision him being involved in this one if even as a substitute to see us rope him in from the home side.</p>
                            <p>Felipe Anderson will be brought in as well by us whilst it’s a duo representing us from Arsenal as well. Lucas Torreira will be partnered by Bukayo Saka with both the players being capable of coming on late into the tie and making the most of a struggling and tiring West Ham backline.</p>
                            <h3>WHU Vs ARS Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>Arsenal’s leading goal scorer with the 10 goals to his name, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang was always going to be the first name to be enshrined in our setup for the day. Although the striker has come under massive flak for his ability to do much other rather than finding close range goals, he is undoubtedly Arsenal’s most lethal and formidable goal threat, a player we just couldn’t leave out.</p>
                            <p>Alexandre Lacazette has found the opposition’s goal on just 7occasions in the 35 matches he’s played away from home, but this West Ham defence is the ideal one for him to slump out of his ordeal. He comes in as well from the visiting side while from West Ham, we’ll be wrapping up proceedings for the encounter with the selection of their leading goal scorer, four goal man, Sebastian Halle for this one.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Aubameyang will be captaining our side out for the day whilst Anderson is our vice-captain.</p>
