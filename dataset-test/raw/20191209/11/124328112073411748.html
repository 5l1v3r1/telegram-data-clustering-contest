      <p>The northbound A322 Lightwater bypass remains closed for two miles from Gordon's School roundabout in West End to the M3 junction 3. The M3 southbound exit slip road is also shut.</p>
      <p>Residents in the area have been told to keep their windows and doors closed and to go inside 'for the time being' if they live downwind from the affected area.</p>
      <p>One resident, Debbie Hunt, said: 'I was just about to go outside and clean my car when I heard the news so I stayed indoors.</p>

      <p>'The thing is I need to go out later today but we still don't know what the chemical actually is.</p>
      <p>'It's scary to be told that we have to keep our windows and doors shut. I'm scared to even let the dogs out in the garden.'</p>
      <p>Tory MP for Surrey Heath Michael Gove tweeted to say he is 'investigating' the incident.</p>
