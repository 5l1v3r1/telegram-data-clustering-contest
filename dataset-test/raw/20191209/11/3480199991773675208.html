      <p>Boris Johnson has insisted he is “taking nothing for granted” as he launched his final election campaign push in a fish market.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party leader arrived in Grimsby for an early morning market tour and was greeted with cheers and some jokey shouts – along with the smell of fish.</p>
      <p>One worker shouted “Boo Boris” while another man could be heard saying: “He brings them out, eh? Phoney bastards.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson posed for selfies and watched a fish auction as cod and haddock were sold.</p>
      <p>He was given the task of placing labels on sold items.</p>
      <p>Chatting to workers in the market, Mr Johnson asked: “Are you worried about the Dutch super trawlers?”</p>
      <p>The PM was told people are concerned, before he asked: “What’s that one in the Channel, that huge one they had in the Channel?”</p>
      <p>He referred to it as a “mega trawler” and also said: “It was sort of hoovering everything up from the sea then.</p>
      <p>“How can they check which fish they’re getting? They’re just going to take everything on, clean out the seabed, that’s the problem.”</p>
      <p>“Ask the Dutch,” came the reply.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister later held a cod in his arms for the cameras.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson also pulled a box of fish across the warehouse floor, prompting shouts of “Go on Boris” from onlookers.</p>
      <p>Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Johnson was asked how confident he was he could scale the “red wall” of Labour as he bids to secure a parliamentary majority – something the polls suggest he is on course to achieve.</p>
      <p>He replied: “We’re taking nothing for granted, we’re working very, very hard across the whole country and I think it’s a message of unity of bringing this amazing United Kingdom together.</p>
      <p>“If we can get Brexit done then we can move forward with investments in infrastructure, education and technology that will unleash opportunity across the whole country.</p>
      <p>“It’s a message that makes sense whether you’re working in the arts and financial services in London or fishing in Grimsby or the arts and financial services in Grimsby.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was later booed by Labour activists as he arrived for a North East campaign visit.</p>
      <p>A man on a megaphone could be heard saying: “We don’t want Boris in the North East of England.”</p>
      <p>The PM was given a tour of Fergusons Transport, near Washington, and shown some tyres.</p>
      <p>He had been due to visit a deli in the Bishop Auckland area but the event was cancelled.</p>
      <p>A Tory official blamed Labour activists gathering outside the venue for the cancellation and said the decision was taken after receiving security advice.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was worried about “left-wing activists” disrupting planned events, Mr Johnson told reporters: “I think we do want to have a kinder, gentler politics, and I’ve noticed in the last few days that Labour activists have been turning up in a pretty concerted and a pretty intimidating way to try to shout and heckle.</p>
      <p>“I don’t find this consistent with (Labour leader) Mr Corbyn’s claim to want to take the acrimony and heat out of politics.</p>
      <p>“It’s very disappointing and I hope it stops.”</p>
