      <h1>Marcelo Bielsa praises Jack Harrison and Philippe Sandler's 'urgent' surgery - Man City loan round up</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City loanee Jack Harrison has been praised by Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa for his improvement this season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:41:16+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Bray, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/joe-bray/</a></address>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa has praised Manchester City loanee for his marked improvement for Leeds this season after the winger helped his side to an important derby win at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Harrison send over a sumptuous cross for Pablo Hernandez to seal Leeds' 2-0 win over local rivals Huddersfield on Saturday. It was the winger's fifth assist of the season to go with his four goals already this campaign.</p>
      <p>Significantly, Harrison has now improved on his tally for last season at Leeds, where he registered four goals and four assists in 41 appearances.</p>
      <p>The improvement has not gone unnoticed by manager Marcelo Bielsa, who was asked about the key to the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">City</a> winger's consistency this campaign.</p>
      <p>“The answer is in the question,” said Bielsa. “He crosses better and he finishes better.</p>
      <p>“In the last season, he used to cross worse and he used to finish worse than in this season. He has progressed a lot and it’s down to him, his progress.</p>
      <p>“He is a very professional player, he works a lot. He is always looking at every detail and he is improving clearly.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the Championship, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tosin-adarabioyo">Tosin Adarabioyo</a> continued his impressive return from injury at Blackburn with another Man of the Match display against Derby this weekend.</p>
      <p>Adarabioyo, 22, missed ten of Blackburn's first 12 games with injury this season, but has started the nine in a row as Rovers look to climb up the table.</p>
      <p>However, things are not going as smoothly for <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/philippe-sandler">Philippe Sandler,</a> who remains out of action for Vincent Kompany's Anderlecht with a troublesome knee injury.</p>
      <p>Belgian news outlet <a href="https://www.hln.be/sport/voetbal/knieoperatie-dringt-zich-op-voor-philippe-sandler~a7518207/">HLN</a> say the City and Anderlecht clubs will meet ‘soon’ to decide when to sanction Sandler can undergo an ‘urgent’ operation he reportedly needs.</p>
      <p>The decision rests with City, the report adds, and it is unclear whether Sandler will recover at City or in Belgium to give him a chance of finishing the season.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere among City's loan players, Patrick Roberts continues to struggle for game time at Norwich, with his most recent appearance coming for the club's U23s in October. He has played just 34 minutes of Premier League football for the Canaries.</p>
      <p>In Germany, Zack Steffen continues to impress for Fortuna Dusseldorf, despite his loan side struggling in the Bundesliga relegation places. Dusseldorf were beaten 5-0 by Borussia Dortmund at the weekend.</p>
