      <p>Many of you will have fantasised about hitting the jackpot, walking out of your job immediately and shooting off to an idyllic beach in the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>Self-employed Steve Thomson could have easily could have easily called it quits after winning the £105 million EuroMillions jackpot last month.</p>
      <p>But the 42-year-old builder is a man of his word and has been spotted back at work, having vowed to honour outstanding jobs for his clients.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-three was seen hauling boxes, figuring out quotes and driving the same old van he shares with his best friend and business partner Neil Peet.</p>
      <p>Residents from his town of in Selsey, West Sussex said you’d never guess he was ‘one of the richest men in Britain’ and praised his honourable work ethic.</p>

      <p>Hailing him as a ‘total legend’, one local <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10500428/lottery-jackpot-builder-work-jobs/">told the Sun:</a> ‘Steve’s a mega jackpot winner but first and foremost a loyal builder.</p>
      <p>‘He could be sitting on a sun-kissed beach sipping champers but instead he’s still at work like the rest of us.’</p>
      <p>Steve and his wife Lenka Thomson, 41, became the ninth biggest winners in the history of the National Lottery, which celebrated its 25th anniversary last month.</p>
      <p>They were practically speechless at a press conference as they recalled their life-changing win on November 19.</p>
      <p>Steve said he was was ‘on the verge of having a heart attack’ when he realised he had matched all seven numbers.</p>
      <p>He said he only bothered to check his ticket when a colleague who was picking him up for work was running late.</p>
      <p>Lenka and Steve say they want to buy a new home so their eight-year-old daughter and two sons aged 10 and 15 can finally have their own bedrooms.</p>

      <p>Their youngest boy has already asked for a Tesla car while their daughter says she wants a pink iPhone.</p>
      <p>Steve’s parents couldn’t believe the news at first and said: ‘We’ll believe it when we see it.’</p>
      <p>Lenka mistakenly thought her husband had won £105,000 at first, before realising he had become a millionaire.</p>
      <p>She has asked for a Christmas holiday and said their winnings will make her annual trips to see her family in Slovakia ‘a lot more affordable’.</p>
      <p>Steve said ‘everyone is going to have a good Christmas’ and insisted neither he, Lenka or his mum would be cooking this year.</p>
      <p>He has vowed to be ‘sensibly generous’ with his winnings and wants to do ‘whatever he can’ to help his village.</p>
