      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/colby-covington">Colby Covington</a> is enjoying his current run as the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a>'s biggest "heel" - aka the villain of the organization. His controversial personality has been slammed by many to be a fake one and not legitimate charisma, the way <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> had.</p>
      <p>He's currently set to take on the Welterweight Champion of the World Kamaru Usman in less than a week and it's going to be a huge main event for UFC 245. Many wondered what the origins of his personality were and on <i><a href="https://twitter.com/FullContactMTWF/status/1203805400312639488?">The Candace Owens Show</a></i> (H/T <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/colby-covington-claims-ufc-was-going-to-release-him-before-he-cut-filthy-animals-promo-in-brazil">Bjpenn.com</a>), He finally revealed that he nearly got fired before he tuned into his "heel persona":</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve never told this story before but three fights ago, before I fought the No. 2 guy in the world, this guy named Demian Maia in Brazil, they had told my manager Dan Lambert that they weren’t going to re-sign me. They didn’t like my style, they didn’t like that I wasn’t entertaining. This is before I really started to become an entertainer and really understand the entertainment aspect of the business. Before this fight, they told me no matter what happens, I was ranked No. 6 in the world, we’re not re-signing you, we don’t like your character, we don’t like your fighting style. And I’m getting paid $30,000 to go fight the No. 2 guy in the world. After you pay taxes and pay your coaches you’re really going to get $5000 or $10,000,”</blockquote>
      <p>He revealed that his anti-Brazil promo got him a lot of heat but the attention led to UFC re-signing him as well.</p>
      <blockquote>“So I go out there and I beat him up and leave him in a pool of blood in Sao Paulo, in his home city. I shoot this promo on the Brazilians and say, ‘You guys are all a bunch of filthy animals and Brazil you’re a dump.’ So I go and shoot this promo, and I wasn’t supposed to have my job, but that promo goes so viral on the internet, that the UFC’s like, we have to keep him, we have to re-sign him because that promo is so big. So that’s what saved my career and that was the turning point of my career. The rest has been history.”</blockquote>

      <p>While the numbers may not exactly be McGregor-esque for his Fight Nights and PPVs, there's no denying that he's gotten a lot of attention recently. It could be argued that he's done more for UFC 245 in terms of promotion as compared to the Champion, Kamaru Usman.</p>
      <p>Covington's association with the Trump Family has also led to him getting a lot of attention and it's something that he's exploited and it has perhaps led him to get his first PPV main event spot as well.</p>
      <p>Personality aside, there's no denying his credentials in the Octagon and no denying that he has been the next-in-line challenger for the Welterweight Championship for a while now. Tune in to our coverage of UFC 245 this coming weekend!</p>
