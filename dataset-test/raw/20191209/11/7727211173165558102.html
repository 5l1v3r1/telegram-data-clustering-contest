      <p>Martin Lewis has explained the best way parents can save cash for their young children.</p>
      <p>Speaking on This Morning, Martin told Holly and Phil the best bank accounts for children - as well as warning them of the ones to avoid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/money-saving-expert-explains-your-17372984">Martin told viewers</a> they should get their children involved in their finances as soon as possible - educating them about the concept of money and interest rates.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the best account for savings <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/martin-lewis-left-looking-tories-17328921">Martin said:</a> "On interest, the easy winner is the Halifax Kids' Regular Saver (up to age 15), which pays 4.5% AER fixed for a year.</p>
      <p>"You can only pay in between £10 and £100 per month. You are allowed to miss months, but can’t withdraw any money until the year is up.</p>
      <p>"You can open and access it online or in branch. After a year, the rate drops, so get your child to set a diary reminder and move their money to a better account when it does.</p>

      <p>"If you need another, Saffron Building Society is similar but pays 4% AER and you can make withdrawals from it, though you can only open and manage it in branch or by post."</p>
      <p>For larger sums <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/money-saving-expert-martin-lewis-17366371">Martin advised</a> to use the HSBC My Savings account which pays 3% AER on up to £3,000.</p>
      <p>If children are aged 11-18, the Santander 123 Mini account pays 3% on £300-£2,000 and gives a contactless debit card to use in shops. But if your child is under 13, you need to have a Santander current account and open it for them in branch.</p>
      <p>Speaking about whether Junior ISA's are worth opening Martin said: "The big benefit has always been that the interest is tax-free, but unless your children have big earnings or enormous savings their money isn’t taxed anyway, so there’s no gain.</p>
      <p>"There’s a rule that says kids’ can only earn £100 interest a year (so that’s about £3,000 saved in the top easy-access account) from money given by each parent.</p>
      <p>Above that it’s counted as the parents’ income and taxed at their rate – though as most parents don’t pay tax on savings any more either (unless they’re higher rate taxpayer or have a shed load) that isn’t such an issue either.</p>
      <p>"The only reasons for using a Junior ISA is as a way to lock money away until they’re 18 – or to earn a little more on lump sums. The top top-paying JISA cash accounts is from Coventry BS paying 3.6% AER."</p>
      <p>Martin also warned about putting cash in Premium Bonds, saying it was very unlikely that children would win on them regularly.</p>
