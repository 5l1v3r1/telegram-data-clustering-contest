      <h1>Bristol City star sends Manchester United defender message after big derby win over Manchester City</h1>
      <h2>He has been out injured since the start of the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:03:24+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Jay Dasilva has shown where his loyalties in Manchester lie by sending Aaron Wan-Bissaka a well done message following Saturday's Manchester derby.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> star Dasilva commented on the Manchester United defender's Instagram post after the Red Devils overcame their fierce rivals Manchester City 2-1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Robins defender posted fire emojis to show his approval of Wan-Bissaka's display after the 22-year-old posted a picture of himself from the game with the caption "Manchester is red."</p>

      <p>Whilst Wan-Bissaka and Dasilva have never played club football together - Wan-Bissaka joined Man United from boyhood club Crystal Palace, and Dasilva joined <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> from Chelsea - the duo know each other well from international duty.</p>
      <p>Both Dasilva and Wan-Bissaka were involved in the England under-21s squad for the European Championships over the summer.</p>
      <p>It was an unsuccessful tournament, however, with England crashing out in the group stages following defeats to France and Romania and a draw with Croatia.</p>
      <p>Dasilva and Wan-Bissaka started at full-back in the opening game defeat to France, which proved to be Wan-Bissaka's only game of the tournament.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Robins</a> defender Dasilva went on to also feature against Romania, but missed the game against Croatia, with England boss Aidy Boothroyd coming in for criticism after being accused of not knowing his best team, prompting heavy rotation in all three matches.</p>
      <p>Dasilva has managed just one appearance so far this season for the Robins having suffered a stress fracture in his lower leg.</p>
