      <h1>Everton approach sacked Arsenal boss Unai Emery over managerial vacancy</h1>
      <h2>The Toffees are looking for their next permanent manager after Marco Silva was relieved of his duties last week and they believe Emery could fit the bill</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:04:50+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:04</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Everton have reportedly made contact with Unai Emery over the vacant manager's job at Goodison Park following the sacking of Marco Silva last week.</p>
      <p>Emery was dismissed by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> earlier this month following their woeful run of form, but according to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/11882197/unai-emery-former-arsenal-boss-approached-by-everton-for-manager-job">Sky Sports News</a> members of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> board believe the Spaniard could be a success with the Toffees.</p>
      <p>However, it is thought Emery is keen to have more time to contemplate his next move, and wants to improve his English before he takes another job in the country.</p>
      <p>He was allegedly recently involved in an informal meeting with officials from Everton in London, but it now appears unlikely he will take the job, as the Toffees are keen to make a decision as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Interim manager Duncan Ferguson certainly made a good impression by helping guide Everton to a 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> at the weekend, a result which moved them out of the bottom three and into 14th place.</p>
      <p>Other managers to have been linked with the permanent job include River Plate boss Marcelo Gallardo, Vitor Pereira of Chinese side Shanghai FC and Everton's former manager David Moyes.</p>
      <p>Ex-Bayern Munich coach Niko Kovac was also spotted in the stands for their victory over Chelsea, although he has since insisted he was only there as a casual observer.</p>
      <p>Silva, meanwhile, recently released a statement thanking the fans and the club for their support during his time at Goodison Park.</p>

      <p>The 42-year-old said: "It has been a real honour to have managed Everton for the past 18 months and I would like to thank Farhad Moshiri, Bill Kenwright, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, Keith Harris, Marcel Brands and the entire board for giving me the opportunity to be part of this special club.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to all of the Evertonian fans who always live and breathe the club and show such great passion."</p>
