      <p>Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has directed the police to fish out the killers of one Dotun Kosedake who was shot dead during Saturday’s local government election in the state.</p>
      <p>The governor gave the directive in a statement issued on Sunday night by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode.</p>
      <p>He, however, expressed satisfaction at the general conduct of the election.</p>
      <p>He congratulated all the All Progressives Congress (APC) members that were elected as chairmen and councillors in the 16 local government areas in the state.</p>
      <p>He said: “While the election was largely peaceful, the incident in Ikere was, however, a sour point.</p>

      <p>“We commiserate with the family of the deceased, even as I have directed the police in the state to investigate what actually transpired and bring the perpetrators to book.”</p>
      <p>He lauded the professionalism of the Ekiti State Independent Electoral Commission (EKSIEC) officials under the leadership of Justice Jide Aladejana, saying the hitch-free nature of the election was a reflection of their professional conduct.</p>
      <p>Fayemi said he was particularly impressed that the election was held under a peaceful atmosphere as voters and SIEC officials conducted themselves in an orderly manner. (NAN)</p>
