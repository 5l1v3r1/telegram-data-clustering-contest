      <h1>£260 Price Crunch on the iPhone X in time for Christmas for today only</h1>

        <b>Amazon has launched its last minute Christmas deals sale and you can pick up an Apple iPhone X with 64GB of storage capacity in black or silver for just £639.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Give the gift of an amazing handset and also that little old thing of not having to pay for a staggeringly high monthly phone bill with the SIM-free iPhone X, now down to £639.</p>
      <p>We continually check thousands of prices to show you the best deals. If you buy a product through our site we will earn a small commission from the retailer – a sort of automated referral fee – but our reviewers are always kept separate from this process.

      <p>The smartphone itself has long been discontinued from the official Apple Store, though these days the iPhone X handset still usually retails at a pretty dizzying £899 (down from its original £999 value). With a 29% reduction, then, this £260 saving isn’t something to be sniffed at, especially when it’s sure to make someone’s day wrapped up under the Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>At the time of release, the iPhone X was Apple’s most innovative handset design yet, finally ditching the thick forehead and chin of its previous iPhones and thinning out the bezels to near invisibility. Taking on a screen that spans the entire surface area of the handset, the home button packing the TouchID finger sensor is well and truly gone, leaving the iPhone X’s 5.8-inch OLED display to stun.</p>
      <p>Of course, the first of Apple’s almost edge-to-edge screened iPhones, the iPhone X was also the first bearer of the controversial notch, housing the iPhone’s new unlocking method with face recognition, aptly called FaceID, as well as the 7MP TrueDepth front facing camera.</p>
      <p>The rear camera package is another element in which the iPhone X impresses, housing its dual camera set-up, the first time it had appeared on a non-‘Plus’ sized iPhone. Bringing together 12MP main wide-angle camera with a telephoto sensor, the dual camera package also boasts dual Optical Image Stabilisation.</p>

      <p>The iPhone X also packs the A11 Bionic and 3GB of RAM, making it a very capable handset, though admittedly a little old and tired compared to the latest A13 Bionic appearing in the latest iPhone 11 family. Still, in our tests we found it to be a competent processor that allowed for the iPhone X to easily complete all that we asked of it with flare.</p>
      <p>Down to £639, whether you’re treating yourself or not this Christmas, this is a great steal for those who don’t want to get locked into a lengthy and expensive phone contract. Stick with the SIM-only tariff you’re happy with and save a whopping £260 on the iPhone X before it goes back up in price at midnight.</p>
