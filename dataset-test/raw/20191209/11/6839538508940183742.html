      <p>Rebecca Gibney appears to have solidified her status as Australia’s soap queen with a hefty pay cheque for her Packed to the Rafters return.</p>
      <p>The actress will reportedly score $300,000 for the recently announced reboot, making her one of the country’s highest-paid TV stars.</p>
      <p>Woman’s Day has also stated Gibney will act as executive producer, so she is likely to pocket even more cash — for herself and her colleagues.</p>
      <p>“Rebecca’s new position has also meant that she’s been able to negotiate salaries and contracts for her returning castmates,” a source told the mag.</p>
      <p>The insider claimed the actors, including <b>Erik Thompson </b>and <b>Perth</b>’s <b>Jessica Marais</b>, would have their previous salaries doubled.</p>
      <p>Packed to the Rafters aired on Seven from 2008-2013 and has been the subject of persistent reboot rumours.</p>
      <p>The new version, Back to the Rafters, will screen on Amazon Prime next year.</p>
