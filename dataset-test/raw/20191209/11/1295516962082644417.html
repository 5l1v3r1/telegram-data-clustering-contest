      <h1>Godzilla Vs. Kong Leak Shows the Iconic Giants Fighting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:12:25+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Sundi Rose</a></address>
      <p>Warner Bros. debuted footage from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/godzilla-vs-kong/">Godzilla vs. Kong</a> at Comic Con Experience in Brazil, which was subsequently leaked online and then promptly removed. However, a screencap from said footage is still making the rounds.</p>
      <p>The image features both Godzilla and Kong facing off on top of what looks like an aircraft carrier, but it seems like Kong has grown quite significantly since his appearance in <i>Kong: Skull Island</i>. Fans might remember seeing Kong's parents' bones in that film, which -- coupled with a line of expository dialogue -- alluded to the gorilla still having some growing to do.</p>

      <p>In the aforementioned clip, Kong takes a swing at Godzilla while letting out a ferocious roar. Unfortunately, screengrabs are all the remain for those who weren't lucky enough to be in attendance in Brazil.</p>
      <p><i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i> was originally slated for a <a href="https://screenrant.com/godzilla-kong-movie-delayed-reason-why/amp/">March 13, 2020 release</a>. However, last month, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures bumped the release <a href="https://www.cbr.com/godzilla-vs-kong-eight-months/">back eight months</a>.</p>
      <p>Directed by Adam Wingard, <i>Godzilla vs. Kong </i>stars Alexander Skarsgard, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry. The film will open in theaters on Nov. 20, 2020.</p>
