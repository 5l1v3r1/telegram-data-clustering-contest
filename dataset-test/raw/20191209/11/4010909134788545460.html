      <p>Do you believe that the presence of a boyfriend in a digital world is enough for some women? For these women, they just need their other half to be comforting and encouraging them through other forms instead of physically being with them. In China, there are women who are paying for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/virtual-boyfriends-china-1063778/">sweet and caring messages</a> from a ‘<b>virtual boyfriend</b>’. Let’s find out how!</p>
      <p>The service offers you to get text messages from a real person and he will be acting like your other half. The ‘virtual boyfriends’ will treat the women like how they would treat their own girlfriends or wives, just through texting.</p>

      <p>For example, a virtual boyfriend sends a sweet ‘wake up’ text to the woman in the morning just like what normal boyfriends would do, or only some. Throughout the day, the woman will also be receiving messages such as asking what is she doing and other encouraging stuff. Also, the conversations are claimed not involving any sex materials. </p>
      <p>Money-wise, it is said that a 19-year-old female pre-medical student has thrown in more than 1000 Yuan (~RM592.07) into the service. She said that if someone is willing to keep her company and chat with her, she doesn’t really mind paying. A 22-year-old man, who works as a foreign exchange trader, said that he would also treat the girls like they are his real girlfriends as long as it lasts.</p>
      <p>The source didn't mention the name of the app or platform the women are using for those who are interested. What do you think about having a virtual boyfriend, or a girlfriend? Let us know your opinion on our Facebook page! For more viral news, stay tuned on TechNave.com.</p>
