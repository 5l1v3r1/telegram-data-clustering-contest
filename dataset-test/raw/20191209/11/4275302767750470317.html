      <h2>Former Dundee United footballer Gary Mackay-Steven has revealed he woke up in hospital after his infamous river plunge thinking he was on a golf course.</h2>

      <p>The former Celtic and Aberdeen star was rescued from the River Kelvin in Glasgow and treated for hypothermia after he fell into it during a drunken night out in August, 2017.</p>
      <p>But the winger has told how he caused concern after becoming convinced he was on the fairways playing a round when he was actually in a hospital ward.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old said he was unable to take in his surroundings and later told a nurse he thought he was on Union Street in Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>Mackay-Steven said he is still unsure if his confusion was caused by the effects of hypothermia or concussion from banging his head as he was swept along the river.</p>
      <p>He said: “One thing that was bizarre was being in the hospital.</p>
      <p>“The nurse came through and said ‘all the checks are good, you can get out but you just need to tell me where you are’.</p>
      <p>“I said ‘yeah no problem, golf course’. The nurse was like ‘no, have a look around, where are you?’</p>
      <p>“I remember sitting there looking at monitors, looking at wires and my bed and I said ‘yeah, the golf course’. I was convinced I was at a golf course.</p>
      <p>“My girlfriend was in the corner and she had obviously had a hell of a night and she couldn’t tell me where I was, I had to work it out for myself or they couldn’t release me.</p>
      <p>“The nurse came back half an hour later and I said I was at Union Street in Aberdeen. She said ‘No you’re not on Union Street’ and I said ‘I know, I’m at the f***ing golf course’.</p>
      <p>“I asked the doctor what it was and the one I asked didn’t have a clue. To this day I don’t know.</p>
      <p>“I’m not even a golfer. It was bizarre.”</p>
      <p>Mackay Steven, who now plays for New York City in the MLS, said he thought the incident was a laugh at first.</p>
      <p>However, he now admits he could have died if he had not been a fit athlete and strong swimmer.</p>
      <p>He ended up in the river after slipping when he jumped over a wall on his way home from a nightclub with friends.</p>
      <p>The Thurso-born player spent 50 minutes in the water and rescue crews were drafted in to help him before he was taken to Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the Football Daft podcast, he added: “I had a flat party that night after a game. I didn’t actually play in the game which was maybe a good thing for later on because I had the energy to keep afloat.</p>
      <p>“Survival guys spoke on the subject after and I had been in for that length of time and had been drinking so it was so dangerous.</p>
      <p>“I jumped over this wall and all of a sudden I was in the river.</p>
      <p>“I got caught in what was like rapids and then I was swept down the river for a good bit.</p>
      <p>“I remember being under water and going pretty fast so it was mental. Being able to swim helped greatly.”</p>
