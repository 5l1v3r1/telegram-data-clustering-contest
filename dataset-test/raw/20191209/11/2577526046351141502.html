      <h1>Fortnite Will Show an Exclusive Star Wars Scene This Weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:26:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>I’m still trekking across the galaxy with Cal Kestis and pals in <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, which means that the upcoming release of The Rise of Skywalker has largely snuck up on me. To help boost the hype, however, <i>Fortnite</i> will be showing off an exclusive scene from the movie at its in-game cinema.</p>
      <p>In a tweet over the weekend, the battle royale’s official account confirmed that the Stormtrooper and Star Destroyer appearances would be followed up by the scene premiere on December 14. The event will take place at Risky Reels, <i>Fortnite</i>’s drive-in movie theatre, at 7pm GMT, but doors will open 30 minutes beforehand.</p>

      <p>The poster also confirms the involvement of director J.J. Abrams, but it’s in no way clear exactly what role he’ll be playing in proceedings.</p>
      <p>Fortnite’s had its fair-share of movie tie-ins, from The Avengers to Wreck-It Ralph, but this event seems to have more in common with February’s Marshmello concert. That’s supposed to have attracted more than ten million concurrent players, so it’ll be interesting to see how many people show up to Risky Reels this weekend - Fortnite hasn’t quite hung onto its cultural relevance this year, but I’m going to assume Star Wars has a little more reach than the masked musician.</p>
