      <h1>Christmas done cheaper with everything you need under £100- including food and booze</h1>
      <h2>Get everything you need for Christmas in one quick swoop for MUCH less than your usual splurges</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:54:31+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Stacey Dutton</a></address>
      <p>Christmas can so easily be a huge expense for families that can so quickly add up.</p>
      <p>With everything taken into consideration including food, decorations, presents and food and booze- we can all be guilty of sometimes forking out when it's completely unnecessary.</p>
      <p>With a bit of preparation, you can have a full family Christmas for less than £100 and it shouldn't be too much of an effort.</p>
      <p>It does not mean you need to scrimp and save on cheaper, heavily discounted items- there's award-winning fizz, Waitrose veg and four bottles of booze included - and that's not counting the brandy butter.</p>
      <p>Financial app <a href="https://wagestream.co.uk/">Wagestream</a> made a list of everything a family of four needs to enjoy a traditional Christmas, then went on a hunt to find out where to get the best value for it.</p>
      <p>Wagestream chief executive Peter Briffett said: “Christmas can be hugely stressful for many households, as there is massive pressure to deliver the perfect day for all the family.</p>
      <p>“Children are bombarded with adverts showing expensive must-have toys, and families end up over-spending on Christmas in an attempt to keep up with the Joneses, which can result in expensive interest payments for credit card debt and loans in January.</p>
      <p>“We thought it would be nice to do some research to show that you don’t have to spend a fortune to have a great Christmas — and you don’t need to scrimp on the simple pleasures either."</p>
      <p>The pick of items include a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings - from sprouts and carrots to Chipolatas and parsnips.</p>
      <p>In fact, the most expensive bit of the whole day is the turkey, which costs £9.99 from Lidl, followed by the cake (£6 from Tesco).</p>
      <p>Presents are also included for mum, dad and two children - and they've even budgeted for after-dinner entertainment with board games and the obligatory box of Quality Street to nibble on while you play.</p>
      <p>Here's the full list of what's included and where to buy it from at our top supermarkets <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=7052&amp;clickref=Wales-xmas99&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.tesco.com%252Fgroceries%252F%5D%5D">Tesco</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1536629&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asda.com%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walesonline.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-news%2Fyou-can-christmas-9961-including-17386631">Asda</a>, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=3691&amp;clickref=Wales-Xmas99&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.waitrose.com%252F%5D%5D">Waitrose</a>, Lidl and high street favourites <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=2041&amp;clickref=Wales-Xmas99&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.boots.com%252F%5D%5D">Boots</a>, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=2400&amp;clickref=Wales-xmas99&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.wilko.com%252F%5D%5D">Wilko</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1536629&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theworks.co.uk%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walesonline.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-news%2Fyou-can-christmas-9961-including-17386631">The Works</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1536629&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hobbycraft.co.uk%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walesonline.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-news%2Fyou-can-christmas-9961-including-17386631">Hobbycraft</a>.</p>
