        <b>Russia has been hit with a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</b>
      </p>
      <p>But the Russians, who were part of Scotland's qualifying group, are clear to compete in the Euro 2020 football championship because European football's governing body UEFA is not recognised as a major event organisation in terms of rulings on anti-doping breaches.</p>
      <p>St Petersburg is a designated host city for Euro 2020, but Russia will not be permitted to participate in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, or the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</p>
      <p>Athletes from Russia who can prove they have not been involved in the doping scandal will be able to compete under a neutral flag, with the Russian flag and national anthem banned from all major sporting events, according to the BBC,.</p>
      <p>More than 160 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after Russia was banned at the 2014 Games in Sochi.</p>
      <p>Russia has been barred from competing as a nation in athletics events since 2015.</p>
      <p>WADA's executive committee made the unanimous call during a meeting in Lausanne in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Russia's internal anti-doping agency RUSADA was declared "non-compliant" for tampering with data handed to investigators in January 2019.</p>
      <p>It was told to hand over laboratory data to WADA as a condition of its controversial reinstatement in 2018 after a three-year suspension for the state-sponsored doping scandal.</p>
      <p>Russia has 21 days to appeal the ban.</p>
