      <p><a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2019/09/06/lizzo-my-self-hatred-got-so-bad-i-was-fantasising-about-being-other-people">Speaking for</a> the magazine's 'Women in Music' issue last year, the 'Truth Hurts" star revealed that she spent much of her youth wishing she was somebody else.</p>
      <p>“I had an insecurity about what a star looks like, or what a front-person looks like,” she <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a28912168/lizzo-interview-october-2019-elle-cover/">told the magazine</a>.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I was inadequate; I felt like I wasn’t enough; I felt like people didn’t want to look at me and listen to what I had to say.”</p>
      <p>She continued, explaining: “I didn’t love who I was. And the reason I didn’t love who I was is because I was told I wasn’t lovable by the media, by [people at] school, by not seeing myself in beauty ads, by not seeing myself in television… by lack of representation.</p>
