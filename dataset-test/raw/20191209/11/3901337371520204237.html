      <p>United <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/manchester-united/english-premier-league-report-manchester-city-v-manchester-united-07-december-2019/668995">somewhat surprisingly beat City</a> at their own home ground on Saturday, leaving the Etihad Stadium with a 2-1 win.</p>
      <p>Guardiola was once again an animated figure on the touchline after penalty shouts for potential handballs against Victor Lindelof and Fred were not given.</p>
      <p>The City boss was then seen arguing with Solskjaer in the second half, when the latter appealed for a handball, but later lifted the lid on their exchange.</p>
      <p>"It was a joke," the City coach said, as quoted by <i>Manchester Evening News</i>.</p>
      <p>"He complained about one hand and I said, 'today, don't complain about the hands, please!'"</p>

      <p>Solskjaer, who beat Guardiola's Citizens as well as Jose Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur in the space of just four days, remained full of praise for United's crosstown rivals as well as the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>"You have to have fun when you have these games," the Norwegian said.</p>
      <p>"For me, he (Guardiola) is the best coach in the world. I have admired him since he took over at Barcelona and I can only say again that I think these are the best team in the league because the way he gets them playing, they give us problems from every angle and he has done that with all the teams he has had so I will always, always look up to him.</p>
      <p>"I've read his books – put it that way!"</p>
