      <h1>Manchester United midfielder Fred praised for proving his critics wrong</h1>
      <h2>The Brazilian midfielder has played a key role in wins over Tottenham and Man City</h2>

      <p>Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp has lauded the impact made by <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> midfielder Fred, and feels he’s answered his critics with his recent performances.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old was the subject of a lot of criticism during his first season at Old Trafford, having struggled to settle in the Premier League following his £52m move from Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
      <p>But, the Brazilian has looked more assured this season though, and he played a big role in United’s recent victories over Tottenham and <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>And, writing in his <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7769663/REDKNAPP-Everton-Duncan-Ferguson-job-rest-Premier-League-season.html">Daily Mail</a> column, former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Redknapp feels Fred deserves some praise for turning his form around.</p>
      <p>"A defeat against Astana and draw at home to Aston Villa one week, then back-to-back wins over Tottenham and Manchester City the next," Redknapp said.</p>
      <p>"It would be too much to say Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have turned a corner but what an uplifting few days for the Norwegian.</p>
      <p>"Marcus Rashford is on fire and getting bums off seats. Mason Greenwood, who I hear does amazing things in training, is such a prospect, too. But the player I'm most pleased for is Fred.</p>
      <p>"The stick he received was remarkable. From 'useless' to 'waste of money', he was called it all. Maybe he is not the answer for Manchester United in the long term. Maybe he won't be their midfield lynchpin for years to come.</p>
      <p>"But he has dug deep and refused to let the critics win. He was superb against City. In the same way everyone was quick to criticise, let's give him the credit he deserves, too."</p>
      <p>United’s upturn in form has seen them move up to fifth in the Premier League, where they sit five points off fourth-placed Chelsea.</p>
      <p>They’re back in Europa League action on Thursday as they play their final group stage game against AZ Alkmaar, before they look to make it three league wins in a row when they take on Everton.</p>
