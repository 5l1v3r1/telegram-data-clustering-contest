      <p>Cassiel Wuta-Ofei, 27, known by his stage name, Scribz, and Malki Martin, 24, who goes by ASAP, were sentenced to a total of nine years behind bars for operating a drugs network that shipped heroin and crack cocaine to the Home Counties.</p>
      <p>The pair, part of rap group 67, which was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 2016 MOBO award, were stopped while driving a Mercedes A Class in Basingstoke, Hampshire in March last year.</p>

      <p>Officers found a mobile phone used by a prolific county line using the moniker 'Ozzy'.</p>
      <p>An investigation later revealed number plate recognition camera records of repeated journeys between Lambeth, south London and Basingstoke.</p>
      <p>Using the camera and phone data officers proved that Martin and Wuta-Ofei were the main line-holders for the Ozzy network.</p>
      <p>When Martin was arrested, police found two more SIM cards which were found to be county lines operators using the nicknames 'Baz' and 'Joey'.</p>
      <p>Inner London Crown Court heard that Wuta-Ofei and Martin had prior convictions for possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin relating to 2013.</p>
      <p>On this occasion, the men were also involved in drug supply together.</p>
      <p>Martin, of Streatham Hill, south west London, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine.</p>
      <p>He also pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin in relation to two further county lines, one operating in Newbury, Berkshire, and the other in Farnborough, Hampshire.</p>

      <p>He was jailed for four and a half years.</p>
      <p>Wuta-Ofei, of Crystal Palace, south London, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine and was also jailed for four and a half years.</p>
      <p>They have also been banned from having unregistered SIM cards for eight years.</p>
      <p>Investigating officer Detective Constable Jamie Grocott, said: 'County line operators ruthlessly exploit the most harmful addictions for profit, relying on a network of vulnerable individuals and a culture of violence and intimidation.</p>
      <p>'The sentences passed today reflect the enormous harm such offences cause to communities across the UK.</p>
      <p>'Both Wuta-Ofei and Martin are young men. I hope they use the time in prison to reflect on the gravity of their crimes and return to society ready to make a positive contribution.'</p>
