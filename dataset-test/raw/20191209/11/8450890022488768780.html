      <p>User stomps up to the cubicle of this pilot fish tech who’s responsible for backups and snaps, “You need to restore my spreadsheet!”</p>
      <p>“Normally,” says fish, “people start a conversation with hello, but I let that go."</p>
      <p>Fish asks user where she stores the spreadsheet. “On my laptop.”</p>
      <p>I’m sorry, fish tells her, but we don’t back up laptops. Anything important should be kept on a server.</p>
      <p>“No, you don't understand,” user says. “I <i>need</i> that spreadsheet!”</p>
      <p>Fish is about to lose his cool, so he tells uers to speak with his manager, sitting in the cube across the aisle.</p>
      <p>At the manager’s cube, user humbly knocks. “Hi, Fred,” she says. “I need to get my spreadsheet back.”</p>
      <p>Manager: Where do you keep it?</p>
      <p>User: “It’s on my laptop.”</p>
      <p>Manager: I’m sorry, but we don’t back up laptops. You should have kept it on a server.<br/>Confesses fish: “I did not inform the user that she should check the trash can on her laptop.</p>
      <p>“My manager didn’t, either.”</p>
