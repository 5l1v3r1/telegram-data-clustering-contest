      <p>Organisers of the UK’s Ramblin’ Man Fair have named eight more artists who will play at next summer’s event.</p>
      <p>The festival will take place at Mote Park, Maidstone, Kent, on July 17, 18 and 19, 2020, with artists including <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-top-10-best-clutch-songs">Clutch</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-hawkwind-songs-by-monster-magnet-s-dave-wyndorf">Hawkwind</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/big-big-train-were-proud-to-be-defined-as-a-prog-rock-band">Big Big Train</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/tour-diary-monster-truck">Monster Truck</a> among the bands set to appear.</p>
      <p>And today it’s been confirmed that <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/motorheads-phil-campbell-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life">Phil Campbell</a> And The Bastard Sons, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/massive-wagons-new-band-dogging">Massive Wagons</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/high-hopes-bad-touch-southern-fried-goodness-from-erm-norfolk">Bad Touch</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-grunge-anthems-as-chosen-by-hands-off-gretel">Hands Off Gretel</a> will all play on the main stage on the Friday.</p>
      <p>In addition, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-return-of-eric-gales-the-guitarist-who-could-be-king">Eric Gales</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/samantha-fish-call-of-the-wild">Samantha Fish</a>, Connor Selby and Blindstone will perform on the Blues Stage on the Sunday.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month it was announced that, rather than play a single set at Ramblin’ Man, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/clutch-announce-three-ramblin-man-fair-shows-including-friday-headline-slot">Clutch would actually play three sets over the weekend</a>: A main stage headline slot on the Friday, a mid-afternoon mainstage appearance the following day – when they'll play a semi-acoustic set – and a headline set on the Blues Stage on the Sunday.</p>
      <p>Festival organiser Chris Ingham said: “Ramblin Man Fair is committed to developing the festival headliners of tomorrow and, wherever we can, innovate the established format of the rock festival.</p>
      <p>“It’s wonderful then that we can kill two birds with one stone and announce Clutch – the band of the moment in rock terms – and our residency concept together. </p>
      <p>"Three sets in three musical styles on three stages over three days – what better way is there for both Clutch and Ramblin' Man Fair to lay out their collective visions?”</p>
