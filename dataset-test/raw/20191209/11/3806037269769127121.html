      <h2>The film also stars Taika Waititi, Lil Rel Howery and Jodie Comer.</h2>

      <p>During the CCXP19 event held over the weekend, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/20th-century-fox">20th Century Fox</a> debuted the first trailer for its upcoming <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/free-guy">Free Guy</a></i> action-comedy starring <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ryan-reynolds">Ryan Reynolds</a>.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/free-guy">Free Guy</a></i> is a hilarious look into the world of a video game where a non-playable character (<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ryan-reynolds">Ryan Reynolds</a>) realizes he’s in a game and decides that he wants to join in on the fun. In the visuals posted above, Reynolds portrays a blissfully oblivious NPC who fulfills his background role in a <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>-style game until he questions his purpose and, naturally, becomes a hero that saves his virtual world. <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/free-guy">Free Guy</a></i> also marks the Hollywood debut of <i>Killing Eve</i>’s Jodie Comer. She plays a gun-toting character known as Molotov Girl. <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lil-rel-howery">Lil Rel Howery</a>, Utkarsh Ambudkar and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Taika-Waititi">Taika Waititi</a> also star.</p>
      <p>Many believe <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/free-guy">Free Guy</a></i> could be a test from Disney to see if similar humor from the film could use for a third <i>Deadpool</i> movie. Additionally the film is rumored to be a test to see if the next <i>Deadpool</i> movie could get away with a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/free-guy">Free Guy</a></i> is scheduled for a July 3, 2020 release.</p>
