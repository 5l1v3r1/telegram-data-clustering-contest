        <b>On Day 9 of the SEA Games 2019, hosts Philippines scripted history by recording their best-ever overall medal haul in the history of the SEA Games. They bested their own numbers from the SEA Games held in 2005, when they had won 290 medals overall.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2005, the Philippines were the overall champions of the SEA Games hosted by themselves – and as mentioned earlier, they had won 290 medals overall – 112 gold, 85 silver and 93 bronze.</p>
      <p>The SEA Games 2005 featured 40 sports – the highest number of sporting events in the entire history of the Games at that time, with more events than even the Asian Games and the Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>And as of right now, at the time of writing, the Philippines have won 320 medals overall – including 128 gold, 93 silver and 99 bronze – in the SEA Games 2019 hosted by themselves once again.</p>
      <p>With three more days to go in the 2019 edition of the Games, it is safe to say that the hosts will set a much higher record this time, as almost two hundred more medal events are set to be held in the coming days.</p>
      <p>The overall medals tally at the time of writing, was as follows:</p>
