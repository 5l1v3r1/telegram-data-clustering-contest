        <b>Former Everton midfielder Jamie Milligan is understood to be the frontrunner to replace Joey Collins as the new manager of Bamber Bridge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brig are expected to announce their new boss imminently and the former Blackpool and Fleetwood Town star is believed to have held discussions with the club’s Board.</p>
      <p>Milligan, of course, spent a period of time as a player at the Sir Tom Finney Stadium and was part of former manager Neil Reynolds’ coaching set-up.</p>
      <p>He helped the club win promotion to the NPL Premier Division in 2017 and was believed to be keen on the manager’s position after Reynolds left for FC United of Manchester.</p>
      <p>However, Mick Taylor was installed as manager at Irongate and Milligan joined the Red Rebels as Reynolds’ assistant manager but he left Broadhurst Park at the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p>Since leaving FC United, Milligan has appeared for AFC Blackpool in the North West Counties League.</p>
      <p>Brig have been without a manager after Collins quit due to personal reasons following last Tuesday’s 5-1 win over Wythenshawe Amateurs in the LFA Challenge Trophy.</p>
      <p>Director of football Neil Crowe and goalkeeper coach Stu Barton were in caretaker charge of Brig’s superb 3-2 home win over Mickleover Sports at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The club have revealed that captain Matt Lawlor has relinquished his role as assistant manager to concentrate fully on his role at the heart of Brig’s defence.</p>
      <p>Former Preston winger Chris Humphrey was thought to be interested in the position, but Milligan appears to be the favourite.</p>
      <p>Brig are away to Whitby Town this weekend.</p>
