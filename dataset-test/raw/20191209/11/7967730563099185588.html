      <p>Bidding for the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics gives Queensland "a shared focus", according to the state's tourism sector, which on Monday backed the bid.</p>
      <p>Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind was among a chorus of industry leaders welcoming Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53ia6.html">decision for Queensland to bid to host the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics</a>.</p>
      <p>"I think we are in a very good position to line up our community's aspiration for infrastructure that can provide for a continued good lifestyle," he said.</p>

      <p>Mr Gschwind said Queensland, and the state's south-east in particular, was a fast-growing region.</p>
      <p>"I think the Olympics will give us a shared focus to evolve our state and our region in a direction that is desirable," he said.</p>
      <p>"It is not throwing us off track. In fact I think it can help put us us on the right track for the future I think with the focus of hosting the world here."</p>
      <p>South-east Queensland has an in-principle agreement with the federal government for a <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p514mu.html">20-year South East Queensland City Deal to deliver a range of infrastructure projects.</a></p>
      <p>Queensland provided new facilities for Gold Coast's 2018 Commonwealth Games and has almost completed a new stadium in Townsville with financial assistance from the federal government.</p>
      <p>Ms Palaszczuk said <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53ia6.html">she had the support of prime minister Scott Morrison and federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese for Queensland to to bid as Games host</a>.</p>
      <p>The formal bid will now be put together over the next 12 months.</p>

      <p>Australian retailers immediately backed the bid saying it could create 129,000 new jobs in tourism, hospitality and in construction.</p>
      <p>National Retailers Association chief executive Dominique Lamb said the Games would provide a massive boost to the state’s business sector in the lead-up and during the event.</p>
      <p>"If successful, we will host around 11,000 athletes from 206 countries. This will mean a massive injection into the economy and the retail sector," Ms Lamb said.</p>
      <p>"Economic analysis shows the majority of the 129,000 new jobs to flow from the Games would be in the retail and hospitality sectors, along with construction.</p>
      <p>"International tourists are predicted to spend around $10 billion during the Games in areas such the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, the Whitsundays, far north Queensland and the Outback.</p>
      <p>Queensland opposition leader Deb Frecklington said she had long supported Queenlsand bidding for the Olympics, an <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p51x7u.html">issue she made clear in her budget reply speech in June.</a></p>
      <p>"The Olympics will be great for our state," Ms Frecklington said.</p>
      <p>"My only concern is of course is whether the Queensland government has the ability to deliver the infrastructure required."</p>

      <p>Gold and Sunshine coast mayors Tom Tate and Mark Jamieson both welcomed the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics push.</p>
      <p>Cr Tate said the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast proved Queensland could host the Games.</p>
      <p>"I think we’re now more than capable of delivering the world’s biggest multi-sport event," Cr Tate said.</p>
      <p>Cr Jamieson welcomed the firm commitment by the Queensland government.</p>
      <p>"The only way a potential Olympic and Paralympic Games bid can be successful is if the three tiers of government are locked in with the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Paralympic Committee as a collaborative partnership," Cr Jamieson said.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a formal announcement will be made by the Olympic Candidature Leadership Group, with representatives from all three levels of government, that Queensland will bid to host the Games.</p>
