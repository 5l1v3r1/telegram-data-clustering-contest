      <p>The artist is said to predicted his own death in a track from his 2018 EP Too Soon…</p>
      <p>In the song Legends, he raps that he “ain’t making it past 21.”</p>
      <p>“What’s the 27 Club? / We ain’t making it past 21”, he raps. “They tell me I’m-a be a legend / I don’t want that title now / ‘Cause all the legends seem to die out / What the f*** is this about?” he raps.</p>
      <p>The “27 Club” is a name for the phenomenon of a number of high profile musicians passing away when they reach the age of 27.</p>
