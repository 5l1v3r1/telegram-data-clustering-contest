      <p>Hong Kong police say they have made 6,022 arrests and fired nearly 16,000 tear gas rounds during six months of anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>The arrests included 11 people detained in raids over the weekend that netted a pistol and other weapons.</p>
      <p>Police suspect the weapons were intended for use during a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands of peaceful marchers on Sunday. Police also arrested 12 people on Monday suspected of preparing petrol bombs.</p>
