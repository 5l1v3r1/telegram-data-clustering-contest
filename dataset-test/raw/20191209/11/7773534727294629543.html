      <h1>AstraZeneca’s Calquence impresses in previously untreated CLL</h1>

        <b>AstraZeneca’s Calquence has been buoyed by impressive survival data in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, stacking up its case for dominance in the therapy area. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The impressive data – presented at ASH 2019 – showed that <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/azs_calquence_threatens_imbruvica_with_new_leukaemia_data_1291636">Calquence</a> (acalabrutinib) combined with Roche’s <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/tags/gazyva?tag=R2F6eXZh&amp;cachebuster=1569188982">Gazyva</a>(obinutuzumab) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) when compared to standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment.</p>
      <p>The detailed results from the phase 3 ELEVATE TN trial of Calquence demonstrated that 93% of patients treated with the BTK inhibitor and Gazyva remained free of disease progression or death after two years. Just 47% of patients on the standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment achieved this endpoint.</p>
      <p>In addition, AZ unveiled results from Calquence as a monotherapy – in this treatment group, 87% of patients remained free of disease progression or death when taking AZ’s drug alone.</p>
      <p>To top off this impressive data, AZ also revealed exploratory analysis of Calquence, in combination or alone, across most pre-specified subgroups of patients who had high-risk disease characteristics, including certain genetic markers. The BTK inhibitor scored on these fronts too, demonstrating consistent PFS improvements in the sub-group analysis.</p>

      <p>“These results also provide, for the first time, post-hoc analysis data exploring the potential progression-free survival benefit of adding Gazyva to a BTK inhibitor such as Calquence versus BTK inhibitor monotherapy in a randomised trial,” he added.</p>
      <p>This recent data-set adds more weight to AZ’s claims for Calquence in CLL, and closely follows its FDA approval for the treatment of CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) on <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/astrazeneca_wins_fda_approval_for_calquence_in_chronic_lymphoma_1317941">21 November</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, AZ will have to convince clinicians to prescribe Calquence rather than its rival Imbruvica (ibrutinib) from AbbVie/Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/imbruvica_scores_expanded_use_in_europe_1297432">Imbruvica</a> is approved as a first- and second-line therapy for CLL, and brought in sales of $3.6bn in 2018, with a target of $4.4bn this year across a broad range of haematological cancer indications.</p>

      <p>While Imbruvica and Venclexta-based treatments are the established standard-of-care for different CLL patients today, an Imbruvica plus Venclexta combination treatment could be a new and innovative option for patients, as evidenced by the positive results from the CAPTIVATE clinical trial," said Mohamed Zaki, head of haematology oncology at AbbVie.</p>
      <p>AZ will be hoping that Calquence’s strong safety and tolerability profile and significant survival improvement will help to assert its benefit over other therapies for CLL.</p>
      <p>However, there is also new competition in the lymphoma market from newcomer BeiGene – the Chinese-drugmaker recently won approval in the US for its MCL therapy <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/beigene_bags_fda_approval_for_first_product_brukinsa_in_lymphoma_1317118">Brukinsa</a> (zanubrutinib).</p>
      <p>It is also in clinical development for a host of other blood cancers, including CLL, SLL, follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma.</p>
