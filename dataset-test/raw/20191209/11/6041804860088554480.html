      <p>For the second weekend in a row, the <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/nikhil-leaves-the-ball-in-nani-court/">Nikhil</a> starrer Arjun Suravaram has emerged as box office topper. It stood as first, including all the new releases that hit cinemas this past Friday.</p>
      <p>90 ML starring Karthikeya was supposed to emerge as the number one choice. It opened decently on the first day. However, subsequently, it had a crash due to poor word of mouth. It was across the board. The Sunday too was flat with no significant jump.</p>
      <p>Arjun Suravaram, on the other hand, dropped at the end of its first week. The second Friday maintained at low levels, but it jumped again on the second Sunday. The momentum was maintained on Sunday as well. Overall, it has achieved a good total and breakeven status in a few areas. It makes the long-delayed movie a success.</p>
      <p>With a big movie slated to arrive on the coming Friday, only a few days run is left for Arjun Suravaram and all other films. Letâ€™s see if it manages to hold at some level or other in the coming days or not.</p>
      <p>The success of Arjun Suravaram is a relief for Nikhil who had pinned a lot of hopes on the movie. It was the biggest film of his career. T Santhosh directed the movie which had Lavanya Tripathi in the female lead.</p>
