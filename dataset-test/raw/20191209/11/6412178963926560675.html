        <b>England will host four-time World Cup winners Italy as they step up their preparations for the Euro 2020 finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Azzurri, who were crowned European champions in 1968, will head for Wembley in Friday, March 27 in the first of four friendlies in the build-up to next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>An FA statement said: “Italy will visit Wembley Stadium connected by EE to face England on Friday 27 March 2020 (8pm kick-off).</p>
      <p>“The fixture will be the first of four tests to help the Three Lions prepare for next summer’s UEFA EURO 2020.</p>
      <p>“The occasion will also be designated as ‘The Heads Up International’ in support of The FA’s charitable partnership with HRH The Duke of Cambridge’s Heads Together mental health initiative.”</p>
      <p>The Italians have been drawn in the same group as Wales, and Gareth Southgate’s men will face another fellow finalist four days later when Denmark head for Wembley.</p>
      <p>They will complete their pre-tournament programme with a trip to Vienna to face Austria at the Ernst Happel Stadion on Tuesday, June 2 before a home clash with Romania at a venue still to be confirmed five days later.</p>
      <p>England’s campaign gets under way against Croatia on Sunday, June 14 with the winner of the play-off path featuring Scotland, Israel, Norway and Serbia their next opponents on Friday, June 19 and the Czech Republic waiting in the wings for the final Group D fixture on Tuesday, June 23 with all three games taking place at Wembley.</p>
