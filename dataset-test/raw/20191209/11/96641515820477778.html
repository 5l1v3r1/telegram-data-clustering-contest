      <p><i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/20/minecraft-character-creator/">Minecraft</a> </i>fans on PlayStation 4 will be able to play with their buddies on other platforms such as Xbox One, PCs and mobile devices starting Tuesday. Mojang is at last <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/12/09/minecraft-bedrock-version-coming-to-ps4/">updating</a> the PS4 version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/15/minecraft-112-million-monthly-players/">colossally successful title</a> to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/11/minecraft-better-together-bedrock-engine-ps4-xbox-360/">Bedrock version</a>, which will finally enable <i>Minecraft</i>'s<i> </i>cross-platform play on Sony's console.</p>
      <p>The update, which should be available on PS4 at 11AM ET/8AM PT, will also bring the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/10/minecraft-marketplace-on-mobile/">Minecraft Marketplace</a> to the console.
