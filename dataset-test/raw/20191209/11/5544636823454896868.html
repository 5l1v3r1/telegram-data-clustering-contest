      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>
      <p>But Concise News understands that athletes who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal will be able to compete under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>The executive committee of WADA made the unanimous decision on Monday in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Russia’s ban comes after the country’s Anti Doping Agency (RUSADA) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.</p>
      <p>Rusada, according to WADA, has 21 days to appeal against the ban. But if Russia does so, the appeal will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p>
      <p>“For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of Rusada’s reinstatement conditions demanded a robust response, WADA president Sir Craig Reedie said.</p>
      <p>“That is exactly what has been delivered.</p>
      <p>“Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.”</p>
