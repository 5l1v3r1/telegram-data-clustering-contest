      <p>"There is no room in football or society for discrimination of any kind, and the club strongly condemns such behaviour.</p>
      <p>"Our ethos at Wolves is about being ‘One Pack’ - an attitude our supporters are very passionate about and that extends to our relationships across the football community, regardless of rivalries on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"The club is now offering its support to Sussex Police in what is a criminal investigation."</p>

      <p>This month has seen the Premier League supporting Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign, with each club marking the campaign at at one home game.</p>
      <p>Brighton were praised for a colourful display before the game, whilst captain's of both sides wore rainbow captain's armbands with players donning the Rainbow Laces.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/1524632/two-fans-arrested-after-homophobic-abuse">statement from Brighton</a> regarding the incident read: "On a day when the club and Premier League celebrated equality and diversity, by supporting Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign, it is with regret that we report the ejection and arrest of two away supporters.</p>
      <p>"Club stewards moved in to remove the two individuals from the away section, after they were reported for homophobic abuse, and the pair were arrested by Sussex Police outside the stadium."</p>

      <p>Chief executive and deputy chairman Paul Barber said, “It’s both sad and depressing that once again we find ourselves having to address another situation of discriminatory abuse.</p>
      <p>“Prior to kick-off, we had a huge show of support for the Rainbow Laces campaign brilliantly backed by the vast majority of people inside the stadium — and yet before the game is over, we are forced to deal with these two individuals, who think it’s okay to behave in this way.</p>
      <p>“Working with Sussex Police, I’m pleased to report that once again our staff were able to take swift action, which hopefully will increase the chances of a conviction. We simply won’t stand for it at the Amex.</p>
      <p>"Once again, it’s very hard to comprehend why some individuals think it's acceptable to behave in this way, but we are very clear that neither Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, nor the wider football community, will tolerate homophobia or discrimination at any time, in any form.</p>
      <p>"We would urge any fans confronted with similar discriminatory behaviour to report it immediately, either directly to a steward or via our anonymous hotline, and we will take strong action."</p>
      <p>The game ended as a 2-2 draw after a frantic first half, with Diogo Jota scoring a double for Wolves as Neal Maupay and Davy Propper struck for Brighton.</p>
