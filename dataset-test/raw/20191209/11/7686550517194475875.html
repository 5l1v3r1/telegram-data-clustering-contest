      <h1>A gigantic asteroid will fly over the Earth during the Holidays</h1>
      <h2>Asteroid collisions happen only once very 100000 years</h2>

      <p>A gigantic asteroid will pass close to the Earth a few days before Christmas, according to NASA.</p>
      <p>The space object - which answers to the name of 216258 (2006 WH1) - is being tracked by NASA’s Centre for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS).</p>
      <p>The object has been designated an Apollo asteroid - which means its orbit intersects with Earth as we orbit the Sun.</p>
      <p>The space agency said it is one of the biggest asteroids in sight this year, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/potentially-hazardous-asteroid-hurtling-towards-21036186">the Daily Star reported.</a></p>
      <p>The rock is taller than the Empire State Building, which means it has been classed a ‘potentially hazardous asteroid’ (PHA).</p>
      <p>If an asteroid is bigger than 35 meters, it is then considered a threat to towns and cities and could also trigger massive tsunamis, should it hit the ocean.</p>
      <p>However, the risk of 216258 (2006 WH1) crashing to Earth is minimal, as it will follow a course 3.6million miles from the Earth’s core.</p>
      <p>Major asteroid collisions only happen once every 100,000 years on average, almost guaranteeing humanity a spatial catastrophy-free Christmas 2019.</p>
