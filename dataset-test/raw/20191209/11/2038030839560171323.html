      <p>Cape Town – Miss South Africa, Zozibini Tunzi, was crowned Miss Universe on Sunday at the 68th ceremony held at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Congratulations came pouring in from <i>The Daily Show</i> host, Trevor Noah, to former Miss South Africa and Miss Universe, Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters.</p>
      <p>"South Africa, we did it again! We did it again! Zozi, we are so proud of you, welcome to the Miss Universe sisterhood. We're all rooting for you. You did it! You did it!" <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/Pageant/watch-demi-leighs-message-to-zozibini-tunzi-we-did-it-again-20191209"><b>Demi-Leigh said.</b></a></p>
      <p>Demi-Leigh was crowned Miss Universe in 2017, but she wasn't the first Miss South Africa to represent the country. Below we look at previous Miss South Africa winners who went on to take on the title of Miss Universe and Miss World.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2019: Zozibini Tunzi</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zozibini Tunzi was crowned Miss South Africa on 9 August 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://preview.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/zozibini-tunzi-on-winning-miss-sa-it-hasnt-sunk-in-yet-20190809"><b>The Public Relations graduate said</b></a> when she took the title, "It actually hasn't sunk in at the moment, I think I'll believe it first thing tomorrow morning." Zozibini said, "You want to do good but then when it actually happens you come crashing, and it's overwhelming, but it's beautiful overwhelming."</p>
      <p>Talking about her reign and her plans, she said, "I wanted to live a more purposeful life because I felt like I wasn't doing anything influential or great with my life. So with this title, I really am hoping to touch lives and just exist in a space where I can make change."</p>
      <p>With the Miss Universe crown on her head, we can't wait to see the places she'll go. Speaking at the pageant on Sunday, 8 August, <a href="https://twitter.com/MissUniverse/status/1203868995092467715"><b>Zozibini said</b></a>, "I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me with my kind of skin and my kind of hair was never considered to be beautiful. And I think that it's time that that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face, and I want them to see their faces reflected in mine."</p>

        <b>2017: Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters</b>
      </p>
      <p>Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters was crowned Miss South Africa in 2017 before taking the Miss Universe crown.</p>
      <p>The Business Management graduate's biggest motivation is her half-sister who had a disability but tragically died earlier this year. Demi went on to do some incredible things, including launching a programme to train women in self-defence after her hijacking in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>"I want women to be treated as equals in every part of the world," she said, according to the <a href="https://www.missuniverse.com/post/2341"><b>Miss Universe site</b></a>. "We are making great strides, but there is still so much to be done."</p>
      <p>Speaking about making a difference, she said, "I learned to take responsibility for my future at a young age. I realized that the only person standing between me and my dreams is me, and with hard work, focus and a lot of dedication, I can become whoever and whatever I want to become."</p>
      <p>Demi-Leigh is currently <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/Pageant/everything-we-know-about-demi-leigh-nel-peters-wedding-so-far-20191108"><b>planning her wedding</b></a> to professional baseball player, Tim Tebow.</p>

        <b>2014: Rolene Strauss</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rolene Strauss was crowned Miss South Africa before taking the title of Miss World in 2014.</p>
      <p>A medical student at the time, the then 22-year-old spoke about winning the title for South Africa when the country was celebrating 20 years of democracy. "It's not me who won it's South Africa who won," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z42fWXCEP70"><b>she said</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"I stood there as Miss South, not as Rolene Strauss, and that paid a huge deal in me winning. We're an example for the rest of the world, showing them that unity and forgiveness and a bright future lies ahead of us. I think that was a great reason why I won. That's why I felt so calm because I knew that not only did I have a story to tell but mu country has a story to tell."</p>
      <p>Rolene is currently married to D'Niel Strauss, and the couple is <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/rolene-strauss-announces-pregnancy-20190808"><b>expecting their second child</b></a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.suninternational.com/stories/lifestyle/miss-world-history/"><b>Helen stepped down</b></a> after the increasingly negative media coverage following her win focused on her being an unmarried mother with an 18-month-old son.</p>
