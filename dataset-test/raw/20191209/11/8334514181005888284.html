      <p>RIYADH (Reuters) - For decades, criminals in Saudi Arabia were lined up after Friday prayers at a central Riyadh plaza and beheaded by sword in a gruesome public spectacle overseen by the religious police.</p>

      <p>These days, families sipping designer coffee stroll through what foreigners call Chop-Chop Square, where the blood of the condemned once flowed. At night, diners drop 5,000 riyals ($1,333) at an alcohol-free restaurant imported from Ibiza.</p>
      <p>Such jarring contrasts are accompanying the rapid social changes under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, like lifting bans on women driving, gender mixing and public entertainment.</p>
      <p>Many Saudis embrace the new openness, but even supporters worry it might be coming too quickly and risks provoking a conservative backlash.</p>
      <p>“The change is fast and extreme. We are people who are not used to change,” said Uber driver Abu Mohsen.</p>
      <p>One businessman compared it to sitting in the back of a speeding car, unable to see out the front and hoping the driver knows where he’s going.</p>
      <p>The festivities at the former execution site are part of the state’s entertainment drive, aimed at capturing money spent abroad and encouraging fun.</p>
      <p>New tourist visas have lured some holidaymakers, and temporary attractions like a safari, amusement park, and open-air theater have drawn over 8 million visitors to Riyadh since October.</p>
      <p>Critics say the government is spending billions of riyals to distract Saudis from slower-than-expected economic growth and divert Western criticism of Riyadh’s human rights record, including last year’s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi which tarnished the crown prince’s reputation as a reformer.</p>
      <p>Despite the glitz, executions continue in less conspicuous locations, with at least 134 so far this year, according to the United Nations.</p>
      <h3>BACKLASH FEARED</h3>
      <p>Fears of a violent backlash spiked after a man stabbed three performers at a show last month. His motivation was unclear, but defiant Saudis blamed years of religiously-inspired hate speech, and shared a 2016 video of Prince Mohammed pledging not to let extremism waste another 30 years of their lives.</p>
      <p>Yet one person told Reuters his conservative friends had privately cheered the attack, and some mosque preachers continue to rail against social liberalization.</p>
      <p>“It was sadly predictable. I always expected a backlash,” a senior Western diplomat said of the incident. “It looks like the first action has been taken, and may inspire others.”</p>
      <p>Some choices appear designed to signal to would-be conservative opponents that their time is up.</p>
      <p>The main building in Chop-Chop, officially Safa Square, belongs to the religious police which Prince Mohammed neutered in 2016.</p>
      <p>Now, water fountains dance outside, music blares, and an illuminated sign obscuring their logo reads “Pulse of Riyadh”.</p>
      <p>“There used to be punishments here. Now it has flipped 100%,” said 21-year-old Faisal al-Kholaif, attending a performance in the square. “We see joy, we see hope, we see everything has changed.”</p>
      <p>Down the road in Diriyah, Saudis dance at concerts near the mosque of Mohammed Abdelwahab, the founder of Saudi Arabia’s strict brand of Islam.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, restaurants are serving mocktails amid speculation alcohol could be permitted soon.</p>

      <p>Such permissiveness could eventually elude the authorities’ control. A woman wearing a face-covering niqab was referred to the public prosecutor after footage of her dancing in public went viral.</p>
      <p>But another video shows U.S. rapper Russ flaunting a bra a fan had thrown onstage at a recent concert, and in one upscale cafe, a young Saudi couple was spotted stealing a chaste kiss.</p>
      <p>A resident of the northern city of Hail, visiting Riyadh last weekend, said such things are very new for Saudi Arabia: “Some people like it, others don’t.”</p>
