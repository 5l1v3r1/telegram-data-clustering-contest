      <p>Cape Town – If you think you can outwit, outlast and outplay now is your chance to put yourself to the test.</p>
      <p>On Sunday M-Net announced that <i>Survivor SA</i> has been renewed for an eighth season.</p>
      <p>Entries have officially opened, and those who think they have the skills to become the sole survivor on a desolate exotic island have until <i>Monday 20 January</i> at midnight to enter.</p>
      <p>To be eligible to enter, you have to be 18 years or older by 20 January 2020. You also have to be a South African citizen or have a permanent residence status and need to make sure that your passport is valid until August 2020.</p>
      <p>To enter, you have to complete the online entry form <a href="https://m-net.dstv.com/show/survivor-south-africa"><b>here</b></a>. Once you have logged on to, you will go through a quick and easy online audition process. First, you will be asked to fill in a short application form with a few personal questions, and thereafter you have to submit a three-minute video, showcasing your game plan and why the <i>Survivor SA</i> team should pick you. If your online application is successful, you will be contacted by the <i>Survivor SA</i> team for a call-back, and who knows, you could be part of the next season’s castaways.</p>

      <p>Executive Producer Handrie Basson says: "If you love watching Survivor, if you have shouted at the TV in frustration and admiration and if you have said ‘I can do this!’ or if you have thought ‘I will never do that!’… then it’s time to get off the couch and onto the island!"</p>
      <p>Nico Panagio will return as host of Survivor SA season eight which will air on <b>M-Net (DStv 101)</b> in the second half of 2020.</p>
