      <p>After Friday’s false start, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a> Prime Video has finally shared the bloody (in more ways than one) first trailer for the upcoming second season of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-boys/">The Boys</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/16/boys-amazon-prime-officially-popular-marvel-series-rightly-10751433">The acclaimed superhero black comedy</a>, which lists Preacher and Superbad duo <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/seth-rogen/">Seth Rogen</a> and Evan Goldberg among its executive producers, debuted on the streaming platform back in July has already received assurances that a second season would be commissioned.</p>
      <p>Fans of the show initially got excited last Friday (6 December) when the trailer was accidentally uploaded online, but the official preview of season two of The Boys was finally screened over the weekend at the CCXP convention in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

          <b>Spoilers for The Boys season one are posted below…</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Eric Kripke’s take on Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson’s best-selling comic looks set for a blood-splattered return with season two, as the trailer opens with Homelander – presumably covered in blood after killing Stillwell in the season one finale – descending down to earth with an astounded look on his face.</p>
      <p>Fans are already predicting that the evil character, played to b*****d perfection by Antony Starr, is making such a face as he’s being confronted with the sight of his estranged son.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the trailer, we get a glimpse of a still-alive A Train (Jessie T. Usher) – suggesting that he has survived the heart attack which was brought on by fighting Starlight (Erin Moriarty) – while a bigger role for Mr. Edgar (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/breaking-bad/">Breaking Bad</a>’s Giancarlo Esposito) in season two is also teased.</p>
      <p>A host of new characters will make their bow in season two, but the likes of newbies Stormfront (Aya Cash), congresswoman Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) and Patton Oswalt’s mystery role aren’t previewed in the trailer.</p>

      <p>With the trailer finally out, the <i>real</i> wait now begins for fans of The Boys – but, with the promise of a new year (and decade) right around the corner, it surely won’t be too long before the Amazon hit series returns to screens.</p>
