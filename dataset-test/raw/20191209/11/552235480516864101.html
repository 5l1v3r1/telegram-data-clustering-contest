      <h1>West Lothian Council agrees to sell off historic Linlithgow buildings</h1>
      <h2>The former town museum is now in private hands</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:14:34+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Sommerville, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-sommerville/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-lothian-council">West Lothian Council</a> has agreed to sell off a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/linlithgow">range of buildings in Linlithgow</a> , including the former Annet House Museum.</p>
      <p>Last week the council’s executive agreed the sales of the former town museum and Caretaker’s Cottage at the back of the old County Buildings.</p>
      <p>Both properties are redundant for public use following the opening of Tam Dalyell House as the new Linlithgow Partnership Centre.</p>
      <p>The former Annet House museum has relocated to the partnership centre and has become the Linlithgow Museum. The executive agreed the sale of Annet House at 143 High Street to Moray and Jane Melhuish for £351,007.</p>
      <p>Corporate estates manager Paul Kettrick told a meeting of the executive the offer from the Melhuishs “represented the best terms reasonably obtainable by the council.”</p>
      <p>He added that strict planning conditions for the building’s conversion to a home would include the preservation of the Rigg, or garden ground as Annet House is on of the few remaining Riggs off the High Street. A Rigg is a narrow strip of land.</p>
      <p>Built in 1787 by a merchant, Annet House was sold to West Lothian County Council in 1929 and was used as the county police HQ.</p>
      <p>During the war it was the Civil Defence HQ and after the war a community centre. It become a museum in 1991.</p>
      <p>Annet House was first put on the market in July and despite a significant level of interest only two offers were received- both well below the home report valuation.</p>
      <p>It was re-marketed again with a closing date for 12 November.</p>
      <p>There were no offers received for community asset transfer.</p>
      <p>Caretaker’s Cottage in Court Square used to be council offices.</p>
      <p>The executive agreed to sell the building to a local architect Andrew Taylor for £150,353. He intends to use the property as offices for his growing business.</p>
      <p>Mr Kettrick told the meeting that the property had not attracted community interest and there had been no expressions of asset transfer request from community groups.</p>
