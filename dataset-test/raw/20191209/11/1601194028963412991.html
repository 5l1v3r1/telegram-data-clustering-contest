      <p>Luka Doncic acknowledged he needs to "calm down" after furiously confronting officials following the Dallas Mavericks' 110-106 defeat to the Sacramento Kings on Sunday.</p>
      <p>MVP candidate Doncic enjoyed a 19th straight game with at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists - the best such streak of any player since the ABA-NBA merger, surpassing the great Michael Jordan's run of 18.</p>
      <p>But the night ended in frustrating fashion for the Mavericks star, who believed he had been fouled as he missed a shot with around five seconds left and Dallas just two points behind.</p>
      <p>Replays appeared to show Cory Joseph making contact with Doncic's elbow, but no call was given and the Kings wrapped up victory before the 27-point star fumed at officials.</p>
      <p>Doncic, who also had seven rebounds and eight assists, later considered his "passionate" approach might need to be reined in a little.</p>
      <p>"My thing is that I'm passionate for the game," he said. "I want to win, and I just sometimes get out of control, because I want to win the whole time.</p>

      <p>"I'm competitive. You can ask my family. Even if it's not basketball, if it's anything, I'm so competitive. But, yeah, I've got to work on that, for sure.</p>
      <p>"I know how to [approach officials] but, like I say, I'm passionate. I know a lot of times I'm wrong. People are wrong sometimes, and I've just got to learn to calm myself down and go to the next play.</p>
      <p>"[Officials] are humans, they make mistakes. I make mistakes; everybody makes mistakes. Just sometimes they don't see it and they don't call it.</p>
      <p>"Like I said, I've got to calm down and go to the next play."</p>
