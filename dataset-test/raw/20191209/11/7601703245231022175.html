      <p>It was after a few hiccups that Sangathamizhan hit the marquee on November 15, 2019, along with Vishal's Action. However, the film had a delayed start in many centres with the Vijay Sethupathi starrer having its first show post evening. The film, directed by Vijay Chander, went on to fetch mixed responses after the initial shows but still garnered praiseworthy collections at the box office. Now, a popular YouTube channel has come up with a report, which talks about the film's budget, pre-release business, final box office verdict and more.</p>
