      <p>This terrifying video shows the moment a volcano erupted and engulfed a tiny island in New Zealand island in a 12,000ft plume of smoke.</p>
      <p>Five people have been confirmed dead and many more are missing after White Island erupted while dozens of tourists were visiting.</p>
      <p>The island is uninhabited but is popular with tourists who want to explore its moon-like surface.</p>
      <p>One of those tourists was Michael Scade who had just left the island when disaster struck,<a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/world-news/terrifying-footage-shows-volcano-eruption-17386141"> reports Wales Online.</a></p>
      <p>He said he had taken a picture of him on the island at 1.49pm, but 23 minutes later the island had completely disappeared in a cloud of smoke and fumes and ash.</p>

      <p>He posted video, saying: "My god. My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it.</p>
      <p>"Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable."</p>
      <p>His video showed a wall of ash and steam around the island and a helicopter badly damaged and covered in ash.</p>
      <p>The site on White Island was still too dangerous hours later for police and rescuers to search for the missing.</p>
      <p>Police deputy commissioner John Tims said the number of those who remained missing was in double figures but he could not confirm an exact number.</p>
      <p>He said there were fewer than 50 people on the island and 23 had been taken off, including the five dead.</p>
      <p>Mr Tims said experts had told them the island remained unstable but search and rescue teams wanted to get back as quickly as they could.</p>
      <p>He said there had been no contact with any of those who were missing.</p>

      <p>Mr Tims said both New Zealanders and overseas tourists were among those who were dead, missing or injured.</p>
      <p>He said most of the 18 who survived were injured and some had suffered severe burns.</p>
      <p>Some of those involved were guests from the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.</p>
      <p>"A number of our guests were touring the island today," the company said. "We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities. Please keep all those affected in your prayers."</p>
      <p>The cruise ship, which had left from Sydney last week, was scheduled to sail to the capital Wellington on Monday night but the company said it would instead remain in the Tauranga port overnight until it learned more on the situation.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was travelling to the region late on Monday.</p>
      <p>She said the incident was "very significant", adding: "All our thoughts are with those affected."</p>
      <p>Brad Scott, a volcanologist with research group GNS Science, said the eruption sent a plume of steam and ash about 12,000ft into the air.</p>
      <p>He said it had also affected the whole of the White Island crater floor.</p>
      <p>White Island sits about 50 kilometres (30 miles) offshore from mainland New Zealand. It is north east of the town of Tauranga on North Island, one of New Zealand's two main islands.</p>
      <p>The island became a private scenic reserve in 1953 and daily tours allow more than 10,000 people to visit the volcano every year. <br/>The island is also known by the indigenous Maori name Whakaari.</p>
      <p>Police were asking people to avoid areas on the North Island that were close to the eruption, including the Whakatane Heads and Muriwai Drive areas.</p>
