        <i>Demonstrators target key roads to demand government action to tackle deadly issue</i>
      </p>
      <p>Climate change activists wearing gas masks have blocked a central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> road to demand the next government tackles “deadly levels of air pollution” in the capital.</p>
      <p>Six <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> protesters dressed in hi-vis suits glued their hands to yellow breeze-blocks in the middle of Cranbourn Street, outside Leicester Square tube station.</p>
      <p>The demonstration, called The Air We Grieve, involved 25 cement blocks the activists said represented the number of Londoners who die each day as a result of air pollution.</p>
      <p>A van parked sideways next to them was emblazoned with a sign reading: “Air Pollution Kills 25 Londoners Each Day”.</p>
      <p>Police later arrived in the street, which protesters said has dangerously high levels of air pollution.</p>

      <p>One protester, Rosamund Frost, a teacher, said: “We are here demanding action on illegal levels of toxic air in our communities, our schools and our streets. In February 2017, the European commission issued a final warning to the UK over illegal levels of air pollution.</p>
      <p>“In May that year, after the government failed to take decisive action they were taken to Europe’s highest court, the European court of justice.</p>
      <p>“The government have neglected to tackle fatal levels of air pollution. How can we put our trust in them to address the broader climate and ecological emergency?”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other Extinction Rebellion protesters were entering their fourth week on hunger strike outside political party headquarters in Westminster.</p>
      <p>The strikers, including the 76-year-old Peter Cole, have sent a letter to Boris Johnson, the prime minister, inviting him to discuss the climate and ecological emergency with them on Monday.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion activists also targeted a major road in the centre of Manchester. Great Ancoats Street, a major route for commuters, has been blockaded since 8.30am with a wooden construction and banners that read “152 Roads in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester">Manchester</a> have Illegal Levels of Air Pollution”.</p>
      <p>Caroline Glassberg-Powell, an environmental scientist and Extinction Rebellion activist, said: “We’re here protesting because the council has decided to build a car park instead of a green space here. I grew up in London, where we have a park at every street corner. Manchester city centre is one of the most devoid of green space places in the UK. It’s atrocious.”</p>
      <p>Steven Fernley, who quit working at a call centre to spend more time with Extinction Rebellion, said: “The police have been very cooperative. So far, no one has been arrested. It seemed that they were just here for a chat.</p>
      <p>“I’m not planning on being arrested, but I’m prepared in case they decide to do a mass arrest.”</p>
      <p>Some commuters were angry at the disruption caused. Garcia Fernandez, a mother on the school run with her son, said: “I’m so angry, they’re causing bloody turmoil. They can’t achieve anything like this, they should go protest outside Westminster, not disrupting the lives of working-class people.”</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester police said that five people had been arrested and the road was now open.</p>
