      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino continues holiday after Tottenham sack as he visits Diego Maradona</h1>
      <h2>Argentina legend Maradona took charge of Gimnasia in September, and ex-Tottenham boss Pochettino was present to witness their fourth win under his former colleague</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:59:24+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> continued his holiday following his sacking by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> as he paid a visit to Argentina legend Diego Maradona.</p>
      <p>The former Spurs boss has returned to his homeland, and went to watch Maradona's Gimnasia side in action against Cordoba on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/diego-maradona">Maradona</a> greeted Pochettino inside the club's stadium before kick-off, having first met each other back in 1993.</p>
      <p>At the time Pochettino was just 21 years old and played for Newell's Old Boys - whom he visited last week, and where Maradona had a brief spell towards the end of his playing career.</p>
      <p>Gimnasia earned a much-needed win having been in the bottom two of the Argentine Super League prior to the match.</p>

      <p>They came from behind to win 2-1, in only Maradona's fourth victory since he took over the club in September.</p>
      <p>He had threatened to leave the club just last month but performed a U-turn to remain with the relegation strugglers.</p>
      <p>Pochettino meanwhile is still out of work after being removed from his post at Tottenham just over three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>His old side have been in good form since his departure, winning four out of their five matches, while Pochettino has seen his name linked with a number of high-profile jobs.</p>

      <p>Bayern Munich were rumoured to be interested in taking on Pochettino to replace Niko Kovac, but Bild have reported Pochettino is not one of the candidates in the frame.</p>
      <p>He was also linked with a shock move to Tottenham's north London rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and Man Utd have also been mooted as possible destinations.</p>
      <p>Pochettino is unlikely to take another Premier League job this season however, due to a clause in his old Spurs contract which means he would have to pay the club Â£12.5 million.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old has made it clear that he is not taking a break from football though, and is ready for a swift return to the dugout.</p>
      <p>He said: "I am open to listen to the projects that are presented to me. My intention is to redirect in Europe.</p>
      <p>"At my age one does not need much time to recover. There are a lot of clubs and attractive projects for me to take on."</p>
