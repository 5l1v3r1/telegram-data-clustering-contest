      <h1>Man Eats $120,000 Art Basel Banana As ‘Performance Art’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:50:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Is art still art if someone’s eaten it?</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/wtf-wednesday-wacky-international-banana-museum-exists-for-fruit-fanatics-1759823/">banana</a> duct-taped to a wall at the Art Basel fair in Miami sold for a whopping $120,000.</p>
      <p>And then someone ate it.</p>
      <p>The piece, titled “Comedian,” is by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan—the man behind the “America” gold-plated toilet that in 2017 appeared at New York’s Guggenheim Museum.</p>
      <p>Cattelan’s “Comedian”—of which there <s>are</s> were three editions—caught the Internet’s attention, prompting mocking copycats and questions of whether overripe fruit taped to a wall is actually <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/new-zealands-giant-hand-sculpture-is-the-stuff-of-nightmares-1800732/">art</a>.</p>
      <p>They also earned the artist a hefty sum, each reportedly selling for $120,000 to $150,000, <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/someone-ate-the-art-banana">according to</a> <i>GQ</i>.</p>
      <p>Each work comes with a Certificate of Authenticity, and owners are advised to replace the banana, as needed. So don’t feel too bad for the wealthy collector who basically spent a cool grand on a piece of paper.</p>
      <p>David Datuna just got the ball rolling.</p>
      <p>The New York-based performance artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5yIFp2hyE-">as seen in a video</a> posted to his Instagram account, sneaks up to the installation, peers around, then grabs the tropical fruit and starts peeling.</p>
      <p>“It’s art performance,” he tells the growing crowd, calling the display “Hungry Artist.”</p>
      <p>Consumption of the original banana doesn’t diminish the integrity of the six-figure artwork, Lucien Terras, director of museum relations for Galerie Perrotin, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/visual-arts/art-basel/article238148809.html">told</a> the <i>Miami Herald</i>.</p>
      <p>“He [Datuna] did not destroy the artwork. The banana is the idea,” Terras said.</p>
      <p><i>The banana is the idea</i>.</p>
      <p>I’ll give you a moment to let that sink in…</p>

      <p>“This has brought a lot of tension and attention to the [Art Basel] booth and we’re not into spectacles,” Terras said. “But the response has been great. It brings a smile to a lot of people’s faces.”</p>
      <p>Not everyone was laughing, though.</p>
      <p>Gallery owner Emmanuel Perrotin was on his way to the airport when he heard the pricey exhibit was eaten. Irate, he hurried back to the space, where a fair goer tried cheering him up by offering Perrotin their own banana, the <i>Herald</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The art dealer, however, put a positive spin on the un-a-peeling event.</p>
      <p>“I love your reactions,” he said in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5yI4FKB-Lb">a second video</a> shared to Datuna’s Instagram page.</p>
      <p>“Let’s find another banana. Because he did not eat <i>the</i> banana. It’s <i>a</i> banana. I ate another one last night,” Perrotin said.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5yJTV4Bka3">a third video</a>, an unidentified woman (who clearly works for the Perrotin gallery or Art Basel) confronts Datuna.</p>
      <p>“Are you crazy? This is so stupid. This is so stupid,” she said, before sitting the Georgian performance artist down to take his name and information.</p>
      <p>“This is about my art,” Datuna said, placing the empty banana peel into an open napkin. “It’s not about publicity. I do so many installations around the world, so I have enough publicity.”</p>
      <p>A piece of borrowed produce was adhered to the wall just after 2 p.m. on Saturday, according to the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first misfortune (or is it a stroke of good marketing luck?) to befall Cattelan’s work.</p>
      <p>His solid gold “art installation” toilet, dubbed “America,” was recently <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/solid-gold-america-toilet-stolen-from-uk-palace-1804069/">stolen from Blenheim Palace</a> in England, where it served as the centerpiece for a six-week solo show of Cattelan’s “iconic artworks.”</p>
      <p>The conceptual artist, known for playing mischievous stunts, denied orchestrating the latrine heist.</p>
      <p>“I wish it was a prank,” 58-year-old Cattelan told <i>The New York Times</i>. “Who’s so stupid to steal a toilet?</p>
      <p>“‘America’ was the 1 percent for the 99 percent, and I hope it still is,” he continued. “I want to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action.”</p>
      <p>The gilded crapper is reportedly worth £4.8 million (nearly $6 million).</p>
