      <p>Tiemoue Bakayoko had a difficult time in England with Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>And his struggles have continued with AS Monaco, so much so that he inadvertently tried to substitute himself off the field during his side’s win over Amiens on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bakayoko is in his second spell with Monaco after having returned to Stade Louis II on-loan from Chelsea during the summer.</p>
      <p>Since returning, however, the 25-year-old has swapped shirt numbers. He used to wear number 14, but now he wears number six.</p>
      <p>At the weekend, that fact slipped Bakayoko’s mind.</p>
      <p>Deep into the second half, the substitute board was raised signalling for Monaco’s number 14 to come off and be replaced by Jean-Kevin Augustin.</p>
      <p>Forgetting he no longer wears number 14, Bakayoko wandered over to the sidelines, clapped the home fans, and tried to exit the field.</p>

      <p>Only when manager Leonardo Jardim informed him he actually now wears number six on his shirt, the midfielder realised his mistake, creasing over in a fit of laughter.</p>
      <p>Augustin, Jardim, and even the fourth official also saw the funny side – all three chuckling at the former Chelsea man’s lack of memory.</p>
      <p>After the match, the club posted the video on their Twitter page, to which Bakayoko commented: “Give me back my 14 please.”</p>
      <p>Monaco next takes on Angers SCO on Saturday, December 14.</p>
