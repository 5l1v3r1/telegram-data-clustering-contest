      <h1>NFL star Khalil Mack pays off 300 holiday layaway accounts at a Walmart in his hometown</h1>

      <p>(CNN) — Chicago Bears star linebacker Khalil Mack is spreading Christmas joy by paying off all the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/05/us/secret-santas-walmart-trnd/index.html">holiday layaway</a> accounts at a Walmart in Florida.</p>
      <p>The store in Fort Pierce, Florida, Mack’s hometown, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Walmart973/photos/a.490403607691847/2692580444140808/?type=3&amp;theater">shared the news on Facebook</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>“We here at Walmart would like to thank the Khalil Mack Foundation for your generosity, and for making so many families happy for the holidays!” they said. “Everyone is truly [grateful] for everything you have done for them!”</p>
      <p>A representative from Mack’s foundation came to the store and asked to be a “secret Santa,” according to the store manager, Mathias Libardi. The payment covered all the store’s 300 holiday layaway accounts.</p>
      <p>CNN reached out to the foundation for comment but hasn’t heard back.</p>
      <p>Mack, 28, is playing his sixth season in the NFL and second with the Chicago Bears. He attended Fort Pierce Westwood High School. In June, his foundation purchased <a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/sports/2019/06/26/khalil-mack-donates-cleats-players-westwood/1568396001/">100 pairs of cleats </a>for the school’s football team.</p>
      <p>‘Tis the season for secret Santas at Walmarts around the country. In Montana, someone paid off <a href="https://www.kpax.com/news/local-news/flathead-county/anonymous-man-picks-up-tab-at-kalispell-walmart?fbclid=IwAR17Dw7AdhF4WfTHo4PEHWhOV6an74413IaiMj0sfpy4b2sQ-qPc2OkvGU0">$3,000 in layaway accounts this week at a store in Kalispell</a>.
