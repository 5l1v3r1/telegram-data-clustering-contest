      <h1>Highest ever number of closure and enforcement orders on food businesses last month</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:27:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/stephenmcneice" target="_blank">Stephen McNeice</a></address>

        <b>The 'highest ever' monthly number of enforcement orders were served on restaurants and other food businesses in November, according to the Food Safety Authority (FSAI).</b>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 23 orders were served on businesses last month.</p>
      <p>Issues identified by inspectors at individual locations included a dead mouse being found in a trip in a kitchen; 'substantial' pigeon faeces found in a wash basin in a food packing area; and high levels of E. coli and coliforms found in drinking water and ice samples taken from a premises.</p>
      <p>FSAI chief executive Dr Pamela Byrne condemned the situation as "totally unacceptable".</p>
      <p>She said: "Some of the reasons for Enforcement Orders in November demonstrate totally inadequate hygiene standards and these operators are damaging the reputation of the food industry as we enter one of the busiest months of the year.</p>
      <p>"With the Christmas period already underway, food businesses must ensure they maintain high food safety standards and I hope in December we see a significant reduction in Enforcement Orders and improving food safety standards."</p>
      <p>You can see the full list of November's orders below, with full details on the <b><a href="https://www.fsai.ie/enforcement_audit/enforcement/order/enf_criteria.html">FSAI website</a></b>.</p>
