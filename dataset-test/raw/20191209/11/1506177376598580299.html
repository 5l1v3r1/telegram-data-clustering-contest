      <p>Greece’s Foreign Minister, Nikos Dendias called out the recent agreement between Turkey and Libya as a product of blackmail, during an interview on Sunday with ANT1 TV.</p>
      <p>“This move has been expected since July and a series of moves and actions have been made to prevent it,” Dendias said and added: “However, the Tripoli government was blackmailed by Turkey as a result of the moves of General Haftar’s forces and signed the text. Our country will prepare and send a relevant note to the United Nations and will take all those measures in the framework of international law and the law of the sea, which will demonstrate that it is totally devoid of substance.”</p>
      <p>He stressed that Greece is a peace-loving country, which seeks friendly relations with all its neighbours and with Turkey. “It does not believe in resolving disputes by force. But this does not mean that it does not have the capacity and the will to protect its national territory,” the Foreign Minister said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Dendias will arrive today in Brussels to participate in the EU Foreign Affairs Council where the agenda includes the provocative Memorandum of Understanding between Libya and Turkey.</p>
      <p>According to the Foreign Ministry, issues of international and regional interest will be discussed, such as the situation in Iran and Bolivia, as well as Euro-African relations, while the Council is expected to adopt conclusions on the Arctic, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy as well as the role of its political missions in international peace and security.</p>
      <p>On the sidelines of the meeting, the Minister of Foreign Affairs will deliver a working breakfast to the EU Foreign Ministers. He has also invited North Macedonia Foreign Minister. Nikola Dimitrov and acting Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Gent Cakaj.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, the European perspective of these two countries and the Western Balkans region in general will be discussed.</p>
