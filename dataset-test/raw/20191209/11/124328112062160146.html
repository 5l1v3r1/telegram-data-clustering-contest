      <p>Disturbing footage shows the moment a woman is grabbed by the hair and slammed into the ground with a thud in a brutal assault by another woman on a night out.</p>

      <p>Before she can make contact however, she is seized by a third woman in high heels and a white dress.</p>
      <p>She grabs her hair, wrenches the woman backwards off the pavement and sends her flying into the road.</p>
      <p>There is an audible thud as her head bounces off the tarmac and witnesses can be heard wincing in the background. </p>
