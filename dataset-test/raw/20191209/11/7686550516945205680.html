      <p>Wales will face Austria in a friendly next March to step up preparations for Euro 2020, it's been announced.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs' men will take on the Austrians on Friday, March 27, 2020, in their "first preparation match of the year" ahead of facing Switzerland, Turkey and Italy in the European Championships.</p>
      <p>It will allow the Wales manager a chance to shape his team in time for his first tournament as Wales boss.</p>
      <p>Wales last faced Austria in Cardiff during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, where Ben Woodburnâ€™s solo strike proved crucial in a 1-0 victory.</p>
      <p>With Austria also heading to the Euros next summer, both teams will be looking to get their preparations off to a winning start.</p>
      <p>The Football Association of Wales say a location, kick-off time and ticket details will be announced in due course.</p>
