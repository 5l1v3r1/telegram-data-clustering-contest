      <p>House Democrats, during a key impeachment hearing today, are expected to begin constructing articles of impeachment against <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, </b>eyeing completion by Friday and a House vote before Christmas. </p>
      <p>Today’s gathering at 9 a.m. will feature presentations from the majority and minority counsels on the Judiciary and Intelligence panels. House Democrats face a historic week in which the outcome appears certain, even as House Judiciary Committee Chairman <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/jerrold-nadler">Jerrold Nadler</a></b> (D-N.Y.) tried to leave his panel some wiggle room during an interview on Sunday.</p>
      <p><i>"We’ll bring articles of impeachment presumably before the committee at some point later in the week,” </i>Nadler said on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/house-judiciary-chair-nadler-says-impeachment-articles-will-presumably-be-n1097746?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma">NBC’s “Meet The Press.”</a></p>
      <p>Nadler, who made multiple Sunday show appearances ahead of today’s hearing, also argued that the Democratic case against Trump is rock solid, telling CNN’s “State of the Union” that a jury would return a “guilty verdict in about three minutes flat” (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/473570-sunday-shows-nadler-a-jury-would-convict-trump-in-three-minutes">The Hill</a>).</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/us/politics/impeachment-partisan-democrats-republicans.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times</a>: With White House absent, impeachment devolves into partisan brawl.</p>
      <p>Notably absent at today’s hearing will be any sort of representation for Trump or the White House, which announced last week that it will not participate in Judiciary Committee work ahead of a possible impeachment vote. The White House views the ongoing effort as illegitimate and believes any involvement would help legitimize the inquiry. </p>
      <p>Where the inquiry goes from here was the central theme of the Sunday shows, which featured Nadler and Rep. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/mark-meadows">Mark Meadows</a> </b>(R-N.C.), a top ally of the president, in a preview of what’s to come this week: more partisan bickering (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/473568-meadows-i-dont-see-a-single-republican-defecting-on-impeachment?rnd=1575822211">The Hill</a>). </p>

      <p>Across the Capitol, the Senate is lying in wait as the House kicks off what is expected to be the final two weeks of its impeachment work, with a trial in the upper chamber likely to start in January. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/473462-senate-braces-for-brawl-on-trump-impeachment-rules">As Jordain Carney reports</a>, Senators are bracing for a brawl over the rules of a looming trial as party leaders are readying to haggle over a bipartisan deal to set ground rules like they did for the Clinton impeachment. </p>
      <p>Senate Majority Leader <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell">Mitch McConnell</a> </b>(R-Ky.) and Minority Leader <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/charles-schumer">Charles Schumer</a> </b>(D-N.Y.) will try to negotiate the deal. However, senators are skeptical the two leaders will reach an agreement, citing the increasingly partisan atmosphere in the chamber. </p>
      <p><i>“There hasn’t been a deal on anything else this year,” </i>said Sen. <b>Rick Scott</b> (R-Fla). <i>“I just don’t see much cooperation right now.”</i></p>
      <p>That leaves two backup options: passing GOP-only rules, which some senators say they are willing to do, or letting it play out on the Senate floor to determine what can attain the requisite 51 votes.</p>
      <p>Along with the rules, eyes continue to be peeled on Senate Republicans who Democrats believe could be flipped to vote to convict the president. As <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/473478-here-are-the-senate-republicans-who-could-vote-to-convict-trump">Alexander Bolton writes</a>, Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-murphy">Chris Murphy</a> </b>(D-Conn.) said Friday that he has had conversations with a handful of Senate GOP colleagues who he says are considering voting for articles of impeachment, but declined to name them. </p>
      <p>While these senators are keeping their cards close to the vest, Sens. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/susan-collins">Susan Collins</a> </b>(R-Maine), <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/willard-mitt-romney">Mitt Romney</a></b> (R-Utah) and <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/lisa-murkowski">Lisa Murkowski</a> </b>(R-Alaska) headline the group as they represent the most likely lawmakers to join Democrats in the endeavor. </p>

        <u>LEADING THE DAY</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>ADMINISTRATION &amp; OTHER INVESTIGATIONS: </b>The Justice Department’s internal watchdog will release a highly anticipated internal report today that concludes that the government’s sleuthing into Russia’s interference with the 2016 election was justified but marred by some errors.</p>
      <p>The report’s findings are expected to disappoint Trump and his supporters, who have called the examination of Russia’s influence in the Trump campaign a hoax designed to delegitimize Trump’s win over former Secretary of State <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a></b>. </p>
      <p>The president and his allies insist the evidence gathered over two years by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI and then former special counsel <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a></b> resulted from political bias and evidence gathered under false pretenses. The report’s key findings may not satisfy Trump, but DOJ Inspector General <b>Michael Horowitz’s</b> report is also expected to bolster the conservative insistence that “deep state” mistakes dogged the Russia probe from the outset (<a href="https://apnews.com/3530610552ff2de85036d08066233b12">The Associated Press</a>).</p>
      <p>Horowitz has found evidence that a former FBI employee may have altered a document connected to court-approved surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser <b>Carter Page</b>. But Horowitz concluded the conduct did not affect the overall validity of the surveillance application.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/473590-carter-page-horowitz-report-will-only-tell-part-of-the-story">The Hill</a>: Page says the Horowitz report will only tell part of the story.</p>
      <p>Congressional Republicans are preparing to shrug off the conclusion that surveillance of Trump campaign associates was justified because of evidence of election interference presented to the DOJ from at least two independent sources in 2016 (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/473545-trump-gop-shifts-focus-from-alleged-surveillance-abuse-to-durham-russia-probe">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p>Trump and his supporters prefer to focus on the pending outcome of yet another internal investigation, one ordered by Barr, who tasked <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-durham">John Durham</a></b>, a prosecutor from Connecticut, to examine the origin of the government’s Russia investigation when Trump was the GOP nominee for president.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/us/politics/william-barr-conservatives.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times</a>: Is Barr what the Republican Party looks like post-Trump?</p>
      <p>Durham’s inquiry went from an administrative review to a criminal investigation for reasons that are not yet clear (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/russia-investigation-inspector-general-report.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">The New York Times</a>). Durham and Horowitz have communicated along the way, and he reportedly told the inspector general that he could not provide evidence to support assertions by some Republicans that the Russia probe began entirely as a setup engineered by American intelligence agents who did not want Trump to be president (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/barrs-handpicked-prosecutor-tells-inspector-general-he-cant-back-right-wing-theory-that-russia-case-was-us-intelligence-setup/2019/12/04/17e084dc-16a9-11ea-9110-3b34ce1d92b1_story.html">The Washington Post</a>).</p>
      <p>Durham’s work is expected to continue beyond the publication of Horowitz’s report today (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/inspector-generals-report-on-fbis-russia-probe-to-be-delivered-dec-9/2019/11/21/6d6d789e-0c70-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">The Washington Post</a>).</p>

      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/473575-chuck-todd-challenges-cruz-after-senator-pushes-theory-that-ukraine-meddled">The Hill</a>: On Sunday, Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/ted-cruz">Ted Cruz</a></b> (R-Texas), who ran against Trump in 2016 and was a ferocious critic at the time, insisted without citing authorities or providing facts that there is “considerable evidence” that Ukraine interfered in the last presidential election to help elect Clinton. In fact, the Senate Intelligence Committee controlled by Republicans concluded three years ago that there was scant evidence to support the idea that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/02/senate-panel-ukraine-election-interference-074796">Politico</a>).</p>

      <p><b>&gt; Trump, Constitution’s emoluments clauses meet up in two courts: </b>The Trump administration this week will defend the president from two separate lawsuits alleging he is violating the Constitution's emoluments clause by profiting while in office from his network of businesses (<a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/473480-trump-heads-to-court-in-fight-over-emoluments">The Hill).</a></p>
      <p><b>&gt; Aftermath of Pensacola, Fla., shooting:</b> Late on Sunday, the White House said Trump thanked Saudi <b>Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman</b>, who committed during a phone call to working with the United States “to prevent” further attacks such as last week’s mass shooting in Florida by a Saudi citizen — now under investigation as terrorism.  </p>
      <p>The president initially reacted on Friday to the shooting of three sailors at a naval base by a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force with worries about Saudi Arabia. By Saturday, Trump continued to empathize with the Saudi royal family, saying that “they are devastated in Saudi Arabia” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/07/us/politics/trump-pensacola-saudi-arabia.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times</a>).</p>
      <p>By Sunday, the FBI said it was acting on the “presumption” that the shooting by Saudi 2nd Lt. <b>Mohammed Alshamrani</b>, 21, killed on the scene by deputies, was terrorism. The Saudi government told the United States it will cooperate with the investigation (<a href="https://apnews.com/8aef6b09fe84ba7f5ee1d0b00e7d1b0a">The Associated Press</a>).</p>
      <p>Alshamrani was receiving flight training at the base with other Saudis and bought his weapon legally from a gun shop early this year. Under U.S. law, an application for a hunting license permitted the purchase of a weapon with a non-immigrant visa (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/navy/473577-pensacola-shooter-bought-gun-legally-report">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p>Authorities are investigating Alshamrani’s activities before the shooting, including a formal complaint he filed against an instructor at Naval Air Station Pensacola (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/us/pensacola-gunman.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times</a>).</p>
      <p><b>&gt; U.S. and North Korea: </b>North Korean leader <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/kim-jong-un">Kim Jong Un</a></b> today took a swipe at Trump, calling him a “heedless and erratic old man” after the president tweeted on Sunday that Kim risks losing “everything” if he backs any hostility following Pyongyang’s claim to a “very important” weapons test (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles/trump-says-kim-jong-un-risks-losing-everything-after-north-korea-claims-major-test-idUSKBN1YC019">Reuters</a>). Denuclearization talks remain stalled between the two countries ahead of a one-year deadline North Korea set for U.S. acceptance of its demands.</p>

        <u>IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>POLITICS &amp; CAMPAIGNS: </b>With just over two months until Iowans kick off the voting season for Democrats, two of the party’s top-tier candidates have engaged in a feud that shows no signs of slowing down and highlights the importance of the first-in-the-nation caucus state for the campaigns. </p>
      <p>Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> </b>(D-Mass.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a></b> have found themselves in an extended back-and-forth that is all too familiar to some Democrats. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/473530-warren-buttigieg-fight-echoes-2004-campaign-serves-as-warning-for-2020-race">As Reid Wilson writes</a> in his latest trip down memory lane, the fight is reminiscent of the 2004 campaign, when a similar cast of characters held the stage, only to help the party blow its chance of ousting an incumbent GOP president. </p>
      <p>At the time, liberals found a cause célèbre in former Vermont Gov. <b>Howard Dean’s</b> (D) primary bid, having distinguished himself as the only major contender in the Democratic field opposed the Iraq War and subsequently saw his stock rise in Iowa. On the other end was former House Majority Leader <b>Dick Gephardt</b> (D-Mo.) who cultivated a blue collar Midwestern moderation and banked on support from organized labor. </p>
      <p>Almost the same show is playing out today between Warren and Buttigieg, who have been at loggerheads in recent weeks. All the while, Buttigieg has risen while Warren has seen her support levels take a hit, though the back-and-forth has left the South Bend mayor on the defensive (<a href="https://apnews.com/555bbbe5bf8b56c1bda8411513761afd">The Associated Press</a>). </p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/473605-warren-says-she-made-almost-2-million-from-private-legal-work?userid=273720">The Hill</a>: Warren says she made almost $2 million for past legal work.</p>

      <p>A warning to both Warren and Buttigieg, however, comes in the form of the 2004 caucus winner: then-Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-kerry">John Kerry</a> </b>(D-Mass.), who spent the past couple of days campaigning for former Vice President <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> </b>(<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/473602-biden-rallies-with-john-kerry-in-early-primary-states">The Hill</a>).</p>

      <p>A slew of Hollywood heavyweights were in the California Democrat's corner before she ended her presidential campaign on Tuesday, including director <b>J.J. Abrams</b>, filmmaker <b>Spike Lee</b>, and <b>Mindy Kaling. </b>But where they — along with other key Hollywood figures, top Harris donors, staffers and early-vote state supporters — head now candidate wise is a question some in 2020 circles are asking.</p>

      <p>➔ <b>Olympic ban</b>: On Monday, the World Anti-Doping Agency banned Russia for four years from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports as punishment for planting fake data and deleting files linked to positive doping tests. Russia has been embroiled in doping scandals for years and was banned from the past two Olympics and stripped of its flag last year in Sochi as punishment for state-sponsored doping coverups in 2014 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sport-doping-russia/russia-banned-from-olympic-games-over-doping-scandal-idUSKBN1YD0L3">Reuters</a>). </p>

      <p>➔ <b>Love, always:</b> <b>David Wisnia</b> met <b>Helen “Zippi” Spitzer</b> when he was 17 and she was 25. They were Jewish inmates at Auschwitz and with death around them, they helped each other survive and planned a life together. They knew they would be separated, but they vowed to reunite after the fighting ended. Seventy-two years later in 2016, they met again for two hours. Both had married and lived rewarding lives, but remembered each other with love. Wisnia settled and built a family in Levittown, Pa. Spitzer, in ill health and widowed with no children, was bedridden in New York City at the time of her reunion with Wisnia.
