      <p>Eric Stewart, of Burnside Mill, previously admitted failing to provide two specimens of breath after he was seen on CCTV trying to drive onto a pavement on Ann Street on December 22.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, he had caused a “dreadful scene” in Dundee city centre by <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/894434/man-on-mobility-scooter-mowed-down-child-while-high-on-drugs/">knocking down a four-year-old child while intoxicated</a>.</p>

      <p>After ploughing into the girl on the Murraygate, both the youngster and the scooter toppled over.</p>
      <p>She escaped serious injury but Stewart, 39, was handed a nine-month jail term and had been recently released when he again rode the scooter while drunk.</p>
      <p>After pleading guilty, Stewart, who has various health problems including cellulitis, was given the chance to go through drug treatment or face further punishment.</p>
      <p>At Dundee Sheriff Court on Monday,  his defence agent acknowledged he had failed to engage with drug services after leaving prison.</p>
      <p>The court had previously heard police confronted Stewart after being alerted by nearby CCTV operators.</p>
      <p>They noted he was slurring his words while acting as if he was extremely drowsy. His eyes were glazed and he was unsteady in his seat.</p>
      <p>He also had what appeared to be fresh cuts on his head. When asked to take a breath test, he became uncooperative and obstructive.</p>
      <p>The incident happened three months after he knocked over the little girl.</p>
      <p>Addressing Stewart, Sheriff Lorna Drummond said: “You pled guilty to this offence at the intermediate diet stage. This is a serious matter and your report shows you have previous convictions.</p>
      <p>“You have recently served a jail sentence and I could just send you straight back. The maximum sentence is six months.</p>
      <p>“Given this is the only alternative, I am going to give you a restriction of liberty order.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t follow it, you will be straight back to jail.”</p>
      <p>Stewart was ordered to have an electronic tag fitted and to stay at home between the hours of 7pm and 7am for four months.</p>
      <p>He was also banned from driving any vehicle, including his mobility scooter, for 12 months.</p>
