        <b>Raheem Sterling threw a lavish Great Gatsby themed party to celebrate his 25th birthday this weekend and, of course, it looked like no expenses were spared to make it a night to remember.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> player, who earns an estimated £300,000 per week, hosted the bash at Manchester’s Hilton Hotel on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Posing on the red carpet with his fiancee Paige Milian, Raheem looked particularly dapper as he channelled 1920s dress in a white suit with a waistcoat and a fur-trimmed coat. Paige, with whom he shares two children, looked stunning in a champagne-coloured flapper-style gown with a white feather in her hair.</p>
      <p>Among the A-listers in attendance including rap duo Krept &amp; Konan, and Raheem’s Man City teammates including Gabriel Jesus who arrived with his model girlfriend Fernanda Queiroz, Fernandinho and his wife Glaucia Roza, Ederson and his pregnant wife Lais, and Ilkay Gundogan and Kyle Walker.</p>
      <p>Inside the bash, photos from Raheem’s memorable photoshoot with GQ magazine decorated the venue, while waiters and waitresses dressed in flapper-style outfits were on-hand to dish out the bubbles. Guests could also entertain themselves in the casino room.</p>
      <p>Joining the DJ in one room was a violinist while a live band with trumpets and drums performed on the dancefloor as Raheem showed his famous dance moves.</p>
      <p>Somehow, he managed to avoid knocking over his nearby four-tier birthday cake while dancing and picking up money which had been sprayed on the dancefloor.</p>

      <p>‘My mum showed me the way, how to be strong, how to be wise, how to live up. Hold your way.’</p>
