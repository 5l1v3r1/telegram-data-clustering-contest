      <h1>Samsung executives guilty of destroying evidence in fraud case</h1>
      <h2>Three employees jailed for up to two years in case linked to $3.9bn accounting fraud</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:06:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author">Kang Buseong, Edward White</a></address>
      <p>Eight employees from Samsung group affiliates were found guilty of destroying evidence by a court in Seoul, in a case linked to allegations of a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d6939bc6-8c0c-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37">$3.9bn accounting fraud</a> suspected as part of a plot to cement control with the company’s founding family.</p>
      <p>Three Samsung Electronics executives were handed jail sentences of up to two years by the Seoul Central District Court, according to state news agency Yonhap citing a court decision.</p>
      <p>The case involved employees from two other Samsung affiliates, drugmaker Samsung BioLogics and its subsidiary Samsung Bioepis.</p>
      <p>It followed a raid on a Samsung BioLogics factory on the outskirts of South Korea’s capital in May, where prosecutors uncovered a cache of electronic devices, including laptops and a computer server hidden beneath a meeting room floor. </p>
      <p>During court proceedings in October, prosecutors alleged the Samsung employees took part in the “biggest crime of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d0627ae2-778f-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201">evidence destruction </a>in the history of South Korea”. Prosecutors had sought tougher jail sentences of up to four years.</p>
      <p>Experts think the ruling will spur a broader investigation into whether top Samsung executives orchestrated moves to transfer power at Samsung Electronics to vice-chairman Lee Jae-yong, son of ailing chair Lee Kun-hee and heir to the country’s biggest company.</p>
      <p>Financial regulators in Seoul previously alleged that Samsung BioLogics inflated the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c998dd54-7600-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab">value</a> of affiliate Samsung Bioepis by $3.9bn in 2015. The net impact of this was to boost Lee Jae-yong’s control of Samsung Electronics, the group’s crown jewel,critics argued.</p>
      <p>Samsung BioLogics did not immediately comment on Monday. The company has disputed the claims of accounting fraud. Samsung Electronics declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The employees indicted in the investigation admitted destroying evidence but they denied that their actions were linked to Lee Jae-yong’s succession or the alleged fraud, according to local media reports. </p>
      <p>Legal troubles have further complicated the outlook for the world’s biggest manufacturer of smartphones and memory chips. Samsung Electronics has struggled to find new growth drivers and has faced a worse than expected downturn in the computer chip market and slower global smartphone sales. </p>

      <p>Monday’s decision came as Lee Jae-yong, Samsung’s de facto leader, awaited a separate court ruling on charges of bribing former president Park Geun-hye. Lee Jae-yong, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46c5a968-08e5-3ae4-a259-3b3432d7868f">who was imprisoned</a> in 2017 but freed a year later, has denied any wrongdoing. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6dbfa2f2-a733-11e8-8ecf-a7ae1beff35b">Park</a> was impeached over two years ago and later jailed in a related corruption scandal.</p>
      <p>The cases have raised questions of opaque governance at <i>chaebol</i>, the sprawling groups which dominate South Korea’s economy.</p>
      <p>Park Sang-in, an economics professor at Seoul National University, said Monday’s prison sentences were “significant” and were a positive step for South Korea’s courts in terms of cases relating to <i>chaebol</i>. </p>
      <p>However, Mr Park said it was “too early to say” whether the prosecutors would be able to prove wider fraud allegations against the conglomerate. </p>
