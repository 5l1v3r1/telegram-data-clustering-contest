      <p>Nintendo ended its E3 2019 show with a bang earlier this year, revealing that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_2">a sequel</a> to <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild"><b>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</b></a> was in development. We were treated to a teasing new trailer (which you can view above), showing Link and Zelda in a spot of bother. It's so creepy and mysterious - <i>we love it</i>.</p>
      <p>Anyway, new images have now surfaced which give us just a small glimpse behind the scenes, with initial concept art being shown alongside a motion capture actor. We also see Link's animation being worked on inside Maya - a 3D CG application - before being shown the final result. The images come from Nintendo's Japanese recruitment <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/jobs/introduction/design/work02.html">website</a>.</p>

      <p>At this early stage, there's still a lot we don't know about the new game, but we did share <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/guide_the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_2_-_everything_we_know_so_far">a full breakdown of that initial trailer</a> a little while ago. In that breakdown, we also list every single thing we've learnt about the Breath of the Wild sequel so far - such as the fact that it's being directed by Hidemaro Fujibayashi and that the game will be darker in tone than the original. Make sure to check it out if you're interested.</p>
