      <p>Paddy McGuinness has said he knew viewers wanted Top Gear to survive – despite there being a lot of “negativity” around the show.</p>
      <p>The comedian and his co-star Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff made their debut on BBC Two’s motoring series earlier this year, alongside returning presenter Chris Harris.</p>
      <p>They managed to reverse Top Gear’s declining viewing figures since the departure of long-standing presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.</p>

      <p>And the new trio scored the highest viewing figures for a Top Gear launch episode since Chris Evans’s first appearance in 2016.</p>
      <p>Take Me Out star McGuinness said he had always believed viewers did not want the show to fail.</p>
      <p>Asked about the positive reaction to their first series together, McGuinness said: “It was lovely. I just got some things sent to me last night on email about how it had done.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t sure of the exact figures or worldwide – how it had done and everything else.</p>
      <p>“It’s lovely that it is back up there and people are enjoying it because even back in the days where it had its… There was a lot of negativity around it.”</p>
      <p>Harris, who was part of the previous presenting team, asked: “What are you saying?”</p>

      <p>McGuinness replied: “I know. Unfortunately, you are still here.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “But I feel as though people love that show, Top Gear, and I don’t think they wanted it to fail.</p>
      <p>“Before we used to go on, I used to say, people want it to be back to where it was. They don’t want it off air.</p>
      <p>“We just give it our best shot and that’s all we can do really. Even that – it could have gone either way.</p>
      <p>“So I was really pleased. Especially the difference in the US. It has gone back up there. It’s lovely to be a part of.”</p>
      <p>The presenting trio visited Nepal to shoot their 2019 Christmas special, navigating perilous mountain roads in city cars.</p>
      <p>The episode will air on BBC Two on December 29.</p>
