      <h2>Amazon launched its Last Minute Christmas Deals sale with £72 off the original Fitbit Versa – the cheapest price around.</h2>

      <p>Deals from Amazon haven't ended. After its Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in November the retailers now gears up for Christmas with its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/browse.html?node=14351804031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3779855-11-0000000">Last Minute Christmas Deals</a> sale that ends 22 December. You'll find a whole host of discounts already, but one that's particularly worth checking out is the £72 discount on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Health-Fitness-Smartwatch-Tracking/dp/B07B9W4V3Z?ascsubtag=06-3779855-11-0000000">original Fitbit Versa</a><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Health-Fitness-Smartwatch-Tracking/dp/B07B9W4V3Z?ascsubtag=06-3779855-11-0000000">, which is now £127.99</a>.</p>
      <p>The Special Edition also has a discount and is now £149.50, which <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Health-Fitness-Smartwatch-Tracking/dp/B07B9PS648?ascsubtag=06-3779855-11-0000000">slashes about £70 off</a> the original £219 price tag. These prices have carried on from the Black Friday period and are the cheapest its ever been on Amazon, while also being the cheapest price around across all major retailers right now.</p>
      <p>While the newer <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smart-watches/fitbit-versa-2-3701517/">Versa 2</a> released earlier this year, Amazon's deal on the original Versa makes it easy to recommend – the features across the two models are practically the same. What you get with the Versa 2 are slight improvements in screen size and design and a stronger battery life. To be precise, the Versa 2's screen is 8% bigger and is an AMOLED display, which means colours are more vivid and blacks are more intense. Other notable changes is the addition of the Amazon Alexa smart-assistant, an NFC chip for contactless payment, and access to Spotify controls (tethered to your phone).</p>
      <p>While these features are all nice to have, the core fitness tracking features remain the same across the two models, which is why we highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Health-Fitness-Smartwatch-Tracking/dp/B07B9W4V3Z?ascsubtag=06-3779855-11-0000000">Amazon's deal</a> if you want to save on a powerful smart watch this Christmas. Of course, if you don't mind paying sightly more for the additional features on new model, Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Health-Fitness-Smartwatch-Control/dp/B07TWFVDWT?ascsubtag=06-3779855-11-0000000">has £30 off the Versa 2</a> as well.</p>
