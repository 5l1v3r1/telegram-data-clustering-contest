      <p>House price expectations rose for the second quarter in a row, with confidence back to average levels at 27 percent, although regional differences remained.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a net 13 percent of respondents said it was a good time to buy a house - the highest level in seven years.</p>
      <p>However, ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley said there was still a way to go before the market could be thought of as "hot".</p>
      <p>"The continued lift in house price expectations is consistent with our own reading of the New Zealand housing market tea leaves," he said.</p>
      <p>"Housing turnover is finally showing some signs of life after a long period of stagnation."</p>
      <p>National prices were expected to rise between 5 and 6 percent by the middle of next year, with interest rates to remain low.</p>
