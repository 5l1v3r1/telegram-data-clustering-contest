      <p>The Tories warned the General Election in Scotland is on a “knife edge” as they called on pro-union supporters to back the party.</p>
      <p>Scottish Conservatives leader Jackson Carlaw said that was the only way to “make Nicola Sturgeon listen for once”.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s First Minister will write to the Prime Minister, whoever that may be following Thursday’s General Election, demanding the power to hold a second vote on independence.</p>

      <p>Mr Carlaw said as he launched a new campaign advert: “We can say no to a second independence referendum, we can say no to more division and we can make Nicola Sturgeon listen for once.”</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Thursday’s ballot, the Tory argued: “Nicola Sturgeon has had her say during this election campaign.</p>
      <p>“She’s said she’d prop up Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10 despite his unsuitability for the job.</p>
      <p>“She’s made clear she’ll demand a second independence referendum as early as Friday.</p>
      <p>“She has said she wants to hold that referendum next year, dragging us back to yet more division.</p>
      <p>“She has had her say, on Thursday we can have ours.”</p>
      <blockquote>A few hundred voters could make all the difference<cite>Jackson Carlaw</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Mr Carlaw added: “In 2017, people came together and backed the Scottish Conservatives.</p>
      <p>“It hit the SNP hard and, as a result, we forced Nicola Sturgeon to put indyref2 on hold. We need to tell her again and halt the Nationalists in their tracks.</p>
      <p>“Across Scotland, this election is on a knife edge. A few hundred voters could make all the difference.</p>
      <p>“So this week, I am urging all pro-UK voters in Scotland to come together and back us.</p>
      <p>“We are the only party with the strength and resolve to beat the SNP, and stop that referendum for good.”</p>
