      <h1>Asian shares rise after buying mood on Wall Street ends week</h1>

      <p><b>TOKYO</b> — Asian shares were mostly higher Monday cheered by a buying mood on Wall Street that came at the end of last week.</p>
      <p>Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3% in early trading to 23,414.51, while Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 added 0.2% to 6,722.90. South Korea’s Kospi edged up 0.3% to 2,088.76. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost earlier gains to inch down 0.2% to 26,451.16. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.2% to 2,906.42.</p>
      <p>“Markets were mostly higher on the solid U.S. jobs data print,” said Vishnu Varathan of the Asia &amp; Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank in Singapore, adding that questions remained on whether would prove enough amid other global risks.</p>
      <p>The surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report had put investors in a buying mood on Wall Street, extending the market’s winning streak to a third day.</p>
      <p>The rally pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by more than 300 points and erased the S&amp;P 500’s losses from earlier in the week, nudging the benchmark index to a second consecutive weekly gain.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department said employers added 266,000 positions, well above estimates of 184,000. The report also showed unemployment falling to a 50-year low. Separately, an index that measures how consumers feel about the economy showed an increase from last month.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 28.48 points, or 0.9%, to 3,145.91. The index posted a 0.2% gain for the week, a solid pivot from losses of more than 1% as of late Thursday. It’s now within 0.3% of its all-time high set on Nov. 27 and up 25.5% so far this year.</p>
      <p>The latest gains also helped stem some of the losses for the Dow and Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The Dow climbed 337.27 points, or 1.2%, to 28,015.06. The Nasdaq gained 85.83 points, or 1%, to 8,656.53. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 19 points, or 1.2%, to 1,633.84.</p>
      <p>Friday’s batch of encouraging economic data capped what started as a rough week for the market.</p>
      <p>Increased trade tensions and disappointing economic reports — including data showing manufacturing continues to shrink and growth in the service sector is slowing — dragged the market to steep losses on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The latest employment report and consumer sentiment data are a welcome development as steady job growth has been one of the bright spots in the economy, along with solid consumer spending.</p>
      <p>Investors also got some encouraging news on the U.S.-China trade front, with Beijing saying Friday that it is waiving punitive tariffs on U.S. soybeans and pork as negotiations for a trade deal continue.</p>
