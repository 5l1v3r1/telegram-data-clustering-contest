      <p>The investigation revealed he had accessed 57 still and moving images deemed category A - the most serious in legal terms - with a further 61 images and videos deemed category B, and 840 others deemed category C.</p>
      <p>Davy pleaded guilty to further charges of possessing an extreme pornographic image, involving a dog, and possessing two prohibited images of a child.</p>
      <p>The offences happened in the Bamber Bridge area over a period between October 2015 and July 2018.</p>
      <p>Davy has no previous convictions, but his defence lawyer acknowledged he was likely to receive a custodial term.</p>
      <p>The Honorary Recorder of Preston, Judge Mark Brown, agreed to adjourn the hearing for a pre sentence report to be prepared.</p>
      <p>Davyâ€™s sentencing date has now been set for January 17.</p>
      <p>He has been granted bail in the meantime with a condition of residence at his home address.</p>
      <p>Under the Protection of Children Act 1978, offences linked to the distribution of such images carry a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment, while those for possession carry a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.</p>
