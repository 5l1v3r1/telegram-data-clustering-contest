      <p>Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marianne-williamson">Marianne Williamson</a> got slammed on social media after she apparently fell for a fake news story Sunday night that claimed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> pardoned Charles Manson, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">murderous cult leader</a> who died in 2017.</p>
      <p>"There is something deeply sinister about Trump pardoning Charles Manson, even posthumously," she wrote to her 2.8 million <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter">Twitter</a> followers. "Dog whistles of the very worst possible kind..."</p>

      <p>The self-help author, who's running a longshot candidacy for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">Democratic presidential nomination</a>, later deleted the tweet and admitted the information was erroneous in a follow-up tweet. “Glad To have been wrong," Williamson wrote in a tweet that she also subsequently deleted.</p>

      <p>According to fact-checking website <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-manson-pardon/">Snopes.com</a>, the story about Trump and Manson is satirical and stems from a phony article published on Nov. 16 by MoronMajority.com. It was then picked up by political website <a href="http://archive.is/rjEnq">the Daily Kos</a>, which didn't label the article satire, and it seems Williamson picked up on it over the weekend.</p>

      <p>Manson died in November 2017 at 83 after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health">suffering a heart attack</a> and respiratory failure, triggered by colon cancer that had spread to other areas of his body. He had been serving a life sentence for orchestrating the 1969 killings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and eight other people.</p>
