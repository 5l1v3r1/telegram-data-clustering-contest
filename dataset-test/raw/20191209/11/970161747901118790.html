      <h1>Angels Of The North's Sammyjo wants her mental health battle to inspire others</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:38:18+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author">Tilly Pearce</a></address>
      <p>Sammyjo Pearson, star of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bbc-three/">BBC Three</a>’s new show Angels Of The North, has opened up about putting her mental health battle on screen – and how she hopes showing her success will inspire others.</p>
      <p>The young entrepreneur has launched her own business in Newcastle with the UK’s ‘most Instagrammable supersalon’ Longlox, which takes centre stage on the eight-part new series.</p>
      <p>Following the loves and lives of those who work and run the salon, the show started with Sammyjo’s return to work after a mental health battle, with the business woman speaking bluntly about juggling work, love and life.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <b>Metro.co.uk</b>, Sammyjo said: ‘I was quite open about it when it happened, on my post a couple of years ago on Instagram. I just put a post on about my mental health and saying that I had a mental breakdown and that I had been taking time out for six months and everyone was shocked.’</p>
      <p>Despite having one of the most Instagram friendly salons for clients to show off their new hairdos and pose for pics, Sammyjo is quick to insist.</p>
      <p>‘Things that you see on Instagram is not real – it’s not real life,’ she said. ‘So people just thought that they can see me and seeing that I had the salon and an amazing family around me, but I was in a mental state that was amazing but I wasn’t.</p>
      <p>‘I surprised quite a few people. I thought I got a lot of people opening up to me about it, asking how I got over it and just asking advice. People that don’t even know me messaging me on Instagram asking for advice.</p>
      <p>‘It’s nice to be able to know I can help other people now that I’ve come through it.’</p>

      <p>Noone’s more proud than her ‘mamager’ Bev, who helps run the day-to-day of the business and keeping all the group of juniors in line.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t really think there was anything we didn’t want the cameras to see,’ Bev said. ‘I feel like the one thing I’m looking forward to seeing is the fact that Sammyjo’s walk back through the door, and she can talk about what happened to her and that could be to somebody else sitting and watching the TV, going through the same thing, they can related to that as well.’</p>
      <p>Now they’re hoping that Angels Of The North will prove to those struggling with their own mental health that they can still be a ‘girlboss’ and overcome their darkest moments.</p>
      <p>‘She’s opened her mind, and her heart and her body and her soul,’ Bev added. ‘Fully into this TV show, to let people know that you can have a nervous breakdown but then you can walk back through the door with a twinkle in your eye, and you’re back and you can survive it.</p>
      <p>‘I think, especially this day and age, it should be talked about. Luckily enough, Sammyjo can talk about it, which is good for others as well.’</p>
