      <h1>Amanda Holden addresses 'issues' with Phillip Schofield amid This Morning row</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:50:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Amanda Holden has thrown major shade at Phillip Schofield amid claims that multiple <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> presenters have complained about his attitude.</p>
      <p>According to reports by The Sun, Ruth Langsford made an official complaint about the 57-year-old, while his relationship with co-host Holly Willoughby has allegedly become strained.</p>
      <p>The report claims <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/07/multiple-morning-presenters-complain-phillip-schofields-attitude-11389889/">eight big ITV presenters have spoken to them about the ‘toxic’ atmosphere at This Morning</a>, with one household name saying: ‘For so long people have been silenced because they are scared for their job. If they speak out publicly about the atmosphere they fear there could be repercussions.’</p>
      <p>And amid the drama, Amanda – who has had her share of run-ins with Phil in the past – has said she ‘admires’ anybody who sticks up for themselves.</p>
      <p>The Britain’s Got Talent star was hosting Heart Breakfast alongside Jamie Theakston and Ashley Roberts when the subject of the ITV wars came up.</p>

      <p>Pussycat Doll Ashley said: ‘Lots of buzz around Phillip Schofield at the moment. There are reports that things are a little tense between him and Holly Willoughby as well as Ruth Langsford. ITV says it’s just gossip and that he and Holly are great friends, both on and off screen.’</p>
      <p>And Jamie quipped: ‘If only there was someone here who might be able to help us with that story…’</p>
      <p>Amanda, 48, said: ‘Listen, I’ve drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip’ – before backing Ruth Langsford in the row.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Well, I’m just gonna say that I really admire anyone that sticks up for themselves because it is not an easy thing to do.</p>
      <p>‘There is a tin opener and there’s a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener. That’s all I’m saying.’</p>

      <p>This comes after rumours that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/23/phillip-schofield-defends-amid-claims-blocked-amanda-holdens-morning-gig-hope-know-better-10034230/">Phil ‘blocked’ Amanda from filling in for Holly</a> when she replaced Ant McPartlin on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! last year.</p>
      <p>‘Phillip actively campaigned for Rochelle Humes to get the job despite Amanda being more experienced — and having been told privately she’d got the gig,’ a former daytime television executive told The Sun on Sunday.</p>
      <p>‘She feels Phil unfairly used his powers of persuasion.</p>
      <p>‘She was told he’d chosen Rochelle because she was easier to “manage” on air – and understandably that incensed her.’</p>
      <p>Following the drama, Amanda expressed her dislike of Schofe, as, when asked what three things she wouldn’t like to find in her home, she replied: ‘Spiders, flies and Phillip Schofield.’</p>

      <p>Phil addressed the allegations on Twitter, writing: ‘The end of another really sad weekend. When you try for 35 years to be the easiest, most fun person to work with and you read such hurtful and wildly untrue stories from nameless “sources”.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously I’ll take it on the chin..I just hope you know me better.’</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for ITV said: ‘‘It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip. Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise. Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike.’</p>

      <p>Martin Frizell, Editor of This Morning, added: ‘I spend hundreds of days a year in their company and what you see is what you get, a genuine friendship from a couple who are both spontaneously funny and professional.</p>
      <p>‘We have the smartest viewers watching telly and believe me they would be the first to notice any issues – they haven’t because there are none.’</p>
