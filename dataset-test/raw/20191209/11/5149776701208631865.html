      <h1>LadBaby to release new novelty sausage roll song in bid for second Christmas No. 1</h1>
      <h2>The Nottingham-born dad blogger is going up against bookies' favourite Robbie Williams</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:55:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>No one can accuse Nottingham-born dad blogger, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/who-ladbaby-you-need-know-2340980">LadBaby</a>, of lacking ambition.</p>
      <p>With one Christmas No. 1 already in the bag thanks to last year's parody charity single <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/ladbaby-bags-christmas-no-1-2352355">We Built This City... On Sausage Rolls</a>, 32-year-old Mark Hoyle has set his sights on a second in as many years.</p>
      <p>It's a feat only The Beatles and Spice Girls have managed in the history of pop music.</p>
      <p>Taking to his YouTube channel, Mark, who now lives in Hemel Hempstead with wife Roxanne and sons, Kobe Notts and Phoenix Forest, he announced the news to his 750,000 subscribers last night (December 8).</p>
      <p>The video, which opens with a flashback clip to last December when Rox and Mark discovered they had made Christmas No.1 and bagged Nottingham its first ever Crimbo chart-topper, has already been watched more than 82,600 times.</p>
      <p>The single, called I Love Sausage Rolls (a parody rendition of the Joan Jett classic), will be up against bookies' favourite Robbie Williams.</p>
      <p>For the second year all profits from sales will be donated to food bank charity the Trussell Trust - and Mark is hoping to double the efforts from last year.</p>
      <p>He says: "I really wasn't going to do this again. Last year's song raised enough money for the Trussell Trust to supply over 70,000 emergency food packages to people and children in the UK living in poverty.</p>
      <p>"Genuinely from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.</p>
      <p>"This year I want to double it, I want to raise even more for people living in poverty - and more importantly - I want Robbie Williams to know who I am.</p>
      <p>"Robbie, we are coming mate, there's a new song."</p>
      <p>The official song and music video will be available on Friday, December 13 at 9am.</p>
