      <p>Kenyan High Commissioner to Uganda Kiema Kilonzo has urged East African residents to embrace golf tourism as they continue to exploit the different business opportunities in either country.<br/><br/>Kilonzo was speaking to golfers at the end of the one-day Kenya Day Golf Tournament at Kitante on Saturday.<br/><br/>“We want to salute Kenya Airways who have decided to waive off baggage fees for golf bags within East Africa that will now be free of charge. We want to encourage golf tourism. We want to see Kenyan and Ugandan golfers playing on either side of their borders,” Kilonzo said.</p>

      <p>He also urged the East African Community residents to continue inter-trading among themselves and urged East African governments to listen to the private sector in their respective countries because they were the back-borne of their economies.<br/><br/>On the course, Mark Namanya and Brenda Maraka emerged the best and will fly to Nairobi and Mombasa respectively courtesy of Kenya Airways and also enjoy Serena Hotels’ hospitality at both destinations after they topped the tournament.<br/><br/>The tournament is held annually in Uganda to enable Ugandans to celebrate Kenya’s independence with their Kenyan neighbours in the spirit of East Africa’s integration. The tournament is also used to cement the two countries’ business and tourism sectors.<br/><br/>Playing off handicaps 28 and 30 respectively, the two emerged with the best net scores from the rain-soaked course to add more prizes in their budding golfing careers.</p>

      <p>“The rain was an issue but I’m glad I played and finished. I’m really excited about this and I would like to thank my playing partner Freda who has always encouraged me to play. It has taken a whole village to teach me how to play golf but I think I will continue improving and become a better golfer,” Maraka said<br/><br/>Namanya, who is barely a year in golf bagged his first career win and promised more of such performances.<br/><br/>“The front-nine was quite good the back was better than the last time I played it. I’m very happy to win this tournament, though it might come with chopping my handicap I’m not scared and I will continue winning these tournaments,” Namanya stated.</p>
      <p>The tournament was sponsored by different Kenyan enterprises operating both in Uganda and Kenya.</p>
