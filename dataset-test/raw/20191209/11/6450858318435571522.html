      <h3>What to look for in a speaker?</h3>
      <p>When buying a speaker online, it’s hard to know what to expect without having first heard the speaker, but here are a few things to look out for.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Power rating and sound</b>
      </p>
      <p>The volume of a speaker depends on the output power, which is the watts rating. The higher the watts, the higher the sound. On portable speakers, usually 15 to 20W should offer sufficient power for 80dB of sound, which is loud enough for indoor and outdoor use.</p>
      <p>Smaller speakers have a lower wattage due to the size, but some can pack power too. One of our favourites is the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/AUKEY-Bluetooth-Playtime-Radiators-Subwoofers-Black/dp/B06Y2DHRVW?ascsubtag=06-3665465-11-0000000">Aukey Eclipse Bluetooth speaker</a>, which ranked first place in our our round up of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/audio/best-cheap-bluetooth-speakers-2018-3665485/">best cheap Bluetooth speakers</a> and offers 20W of power despite its small frame.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, listening at full volume can also cause distortions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bluetooth 4.0 vs Bluetooth 5.0</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some speakers may offer <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/network-wifi/what-is-bluetooth-5-3653376/">Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity</a>. The benefit of Bluetooth 5.0 is that it has greater range, uses less power to broadcast, and can even allow you to stream to two devices at the same time. Most of the latest phones, from the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 8 onwards for example, come with Bluetooth 5.0, so it’s worth checking if your phone does as well.</p>
      <p>However, while a speaker that offers the latest version of Bluetooth may seem like an upgrade from one that doesn’t, you won’t see the difference unless both your phone and the speaker have Bluetooth 5.0 compatibility.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Battery life</b>
      </p>
      <p>Battery life becomes an important feature when buying a portable speaker. On average, portable speakers offer about 7 to 10 hours per charge, so anything that offers less isn’t worth it.</p>
      <p>Ultimate Ears’s Megablast Bluetooth speakers, which is also Alexa-enabled, is one of the best with a strong bass sound and a 12 hour battery life – rather, 16 hours in practice as we found in our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/speakers/ue-megablast-review-3668513/">review</a>. It retails at<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Ears-Megablast-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B075XV74YT?ascsubtag=06-3665465-11-0000000"> £269.99/US249</a>, but we've seen <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/audio/ue-megablast-blast-speakers-with-alexa-discount-3684364/">discounts as low as £140 off</a>, so deals in this range are worth pouncing on.</p>
      <h3>Where to find speaker deals</h3>
      <p>Amazon has some of the biggest bargains, but if you find that you’re missing out on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/deals/ref=nav_cs_gb?ascsubtag=41-3665528-11-0000000">Amazon’s Lightning deals</a>, which run for just a few hours and offer limited stock, we'd recommend signing up for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/landing?ascsubtag=41-3665528-11-0000000">Amazon's 30 day free trial</a> of Prime, which will get you access to deals 30 minutes before everyone else.
