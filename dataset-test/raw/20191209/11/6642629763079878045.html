      <p>Last month, Turkey stepped up the return of suspected foreign ISIL members - either held in Turkish prisons or in Syria - back to their countries of origin, saying Turkey was "not a hotel" for foreign fighters.</p>
      <p>Monday's deportations raised the number of foreign fighters expelled from Turkey to 71 since November 11, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, including citizens of the United States, Denmark, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>At least 18 suspects were returned to Germany, it reported.</p>
      <p>The Turkish interior ministry said on Sunday an Australian national accused of being an ISIL fighter was also deported.</p>
      <p>Ankara says it has about 1,200 foreign ISIL members in custody. Last month, Turkish Minister of Interior Suleyman Soylu <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/turkey-send-isil-detainees-home-year-191119141633890.html">said</a> the country planned to repatriate most to their home countries by the end of the year.</p>
