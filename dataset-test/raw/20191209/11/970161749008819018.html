      <h1>Sora from Kingdom Hearts is not in Smash Bros. claims leaker</h1>

      <p>Leakers have ruled out a host of popular picks for the fifth Smash Bros. DLC character, including Lloyd Irving and Master Chief.</p>
      <p>Trying to guess the DLC characters for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has been a hit and miss affair so far, with the reveals for Persona 5, Dragon Quest, Banjo-Kazooie, and Fatal Fury only occasionally being predicted with any accuracy.</p>
      <p>Nintendo has never said when the rumoured fifth character will be announced but since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/06/game-awards-2019-10-game-reveals-not-resident-evil-3-11281222/">The Game Awards</a> was the venue for the first one there’s a lot of speculation it’ll be used to reveal the final one of this set (although there will now be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/04/super-smash-bros-getting-five-dlc-fighters-banjo-kazooie-today-terry-bogard-november-10688251/">more than five overall</a>).</p>
      <p>One popular guess recently has been Sora from the Kingdom Hearts series, but according to reliable leaker Sabi, that’s not going to happen.</p>

      <p>Not only did they rule out Sora though, they also pooh-poohed the idea of Lloyd Irving from Tales Of Symphonia, despite what seemed to be teases from the character’s voice actor.</p>
      <p>They also shot down suggestions that it would be Master Chief from Halo, at least based on a very obviously <a href="https://vocaroo.com/gO9VyfyY5eE">fake audio intro</a> supposed to reveal the character in Smash.</p>
      <p>Another serial leaker with a good track record, <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/community/Vergeben">Vergeben</a> from GameFAQs, has also ruled out any character from Bandai Namco or Level-5. So no Tekken, Soulcalibur, or Professor Layton.</p>
      <p>They’d also previously ruled out anyone from Ubisoft, Falcom, or Nippon Ichi Software. So no Sam Fisher, Rayman, Prinny, or Tales Of Cold Steel characters.</p>
      <p>Also specifically denied are longstanding rumours about Dante, Doomguy, Ryu Hayabusa, Geno, and Gordon Freeman.</p>
      <p>But really, as relatively reliable as these leakers have been in the past, they’re not infallible and nobody’s track record on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has been perfect.</p>
      <p>That said, the most likely options at the moment are looking like Tracer from Overwatch (assuming Nintendo hasn’t been put off by the recent <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/blizzard-gives-back-blitzchung-prize-money-reduces-ban-six-months-10912872/">Blizzard controversy</a>), a Resident Evil rep (based on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/27/resident-evil-spirits-super-smash-bros-ultimate-fighter-11225341/">surprise inclusion of spirits</a> recently), or simply a new Nintendo character (it still seems surprising there’s been no-one from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/07/arms-review-extended-fight-scene-6692165/">ARMS</a> yet, just assist characters).</p>
