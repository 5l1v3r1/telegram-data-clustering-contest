      <h3>What the papers say</h3>
      <p><b>Chris Smalling </b>is being hunted by numerous Premier League clubs but Arsenal are the favourites, according to the Daily Mirror. Gunners scouts and England manager Gareth Southgate were at the San Siro on Friday to watch the centre-back shut out Inter Milan in a 0-0 draw with Roma. The on-loan player lost his spot at Manchester United when Harry Maguire was brought in over the summer. The 30-year-old is due back at Old Trafford next year but could instead go to north London.</p>
      <p>Chelsea appear to have gone cold on <b>Pedro </b>but that could be Aston Villa's gain. The 32-year-old could be allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in January, The Daily Telegraph reports. The winger has failed to get first team action this season under Frank Lampard, who has instead preferred the likes of Christian Pulisic.</p>

      <p><b>Eddie Nketiah </b>will continue his loan spell at Leeds, even though the 20-year-old has not started a Championship game this season, The Sun says. Arsenal have a clause to recall the England Under-21 striker but are happy for him to stay up north.</p>
      <p>The Gunners want Manchester City assistant <b>Mikel Arteta</b> to replace Unai Emery, the Daily Express reports. The move for the Spaniard follows Brendan Rodgers committing himself to Leicester and former Arsenal player Patrick Vieira staying in his role with Nice.</p>
