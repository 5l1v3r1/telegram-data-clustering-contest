      <p>Generous residents "Crammed the Cruiser" in Lake Country over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The eighth annual Cram the Cruiser event on Saturday collected a total of 1,715 pounds of donated items, including non-perishable foods, and just over $7,460 in cash, cheques and Save On Foods gift cards in support of the Lake Country Food Bank.</p>
      <p>“The generosity of the community never fails to amaze us,” says RCMP spokesman Cpl. Jesse O’Donaghey, founder of Cram the Cruiser in Lake Country. “We continue to see our donors returning year after year, to do something great for such an important cause.”</p>
      <p>Since its inception, the event has collected more than 14,500 pounds of donated items and just over $42,636 for the food bank.</p>
      <p>Lake Country Fire Department members and other first responders also took part, and Save-on Foods and Starbucks provided hot chili and coffee to the donors. </p>
