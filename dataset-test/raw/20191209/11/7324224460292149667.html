      <p>Police are investigating after the funds given at astronautical engineer Dr Angelo Grubisic's funeral on September 19 were mixed up with those made at a funeral the next day.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/walsall/willenhall/2019/08/23/tributes-to-amazing-wingsuit-champion-from-walsall-who-died-in-base-jump-accident/">died while taking part in a planned jump</a> in the Middle East in August, weeks after he was crowned a wingsuit champion by the British Parachute Association.</p>
      <p>The talented scientist worked in Southampton but grew up in Willenhall, and attended Willenhall Comprehensive School, now known as Willenhall E-Act Academy, as a teenager.</p>
      <p>The funds were due to be used to set up a foundation, The Dr Angelo Grubisic Young Engineers Fund, for underprivileged young people helping to get them into engineering.</p>
      <p>Dr Grubisic's family have now started fundraising online to replace the missing money which they claim has been stolen.</p>
      <p>Police have yet to confirm whether the missing money was stolen.</p>
      <p>His sister Karina Grubisic posted online saying: "As some of you know, the donations collected at the funeral of my brother Angelo Niko Grubišić were unfortunately stolen.</p>
      <p>"These donations were intended to set up a foundation, The Dr Angelo Grubisic Young Engineers Fund, to provide funding for underprivileged young adults and help them towards careers in engineering.</p>
      <p>"Regardless of this awful crime and on top of coping with the loss of our dear Angelo, my mum and I are totally committed to making this foundation happen, so that at least something positive comes from the death of Angelo.</p>
      <p>"We have set up a Crowdfunder page to try to recoup some of the stolen donations and we would be so grateful if you could help in any way.</p>
      <p>"If you donated directly to the holding account, don't worry, those donations are totally safe.</p>
      <p>"We would be so grateful if you could repost this and help get the information out to others. It has really upset us, my mum especially. How could anyone be so cruel to do this to us at this time?</p>
      <p>"If you made a donation on the day of the funeral, my mum and I are grateful for your kindness and very sorry that it never made it to Angelo's cause."</p>

      <p>Walsall Police said: "Officers investigating a mix up of donations at two funerals in September in the Bloxwich area of Walsall are appealing for information.</p>
      <p>"A funeral took place at All Saints Church on Elmore Row on Thursday 19 September, where attendees filled the donation box there as well as when they moved onto Streetly Crematorium on Little Hardwick Road.</p>
      <p>"Donations continued until the third location at Fishley Park on Fishley Lane.</p>
      <p>"The intention was for the money to go to a specific charity, but this same full box was accidentally used at a funeral the next day on Friday 20 September at Streetly Crematorium and then Gunners Club on Beeches Road.</p>
      <p>"The donations then became mixed up and it is unclear what happened to the full amount of money.</p>
      <p>"The Grubisic family from the first funeral are keen to hear from anyone who attended and donated money to thank them and also to identify whether they gave any open cheques.</p>
      <p>"Any cheques which have been cashed can then be identified and they can work out what has happened.</p>
      <p>"If you have any information contact us via LiveChat at west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight, or call 101 anytime.</p>
      <p>"Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote 20WS/240611A/19."</p>
