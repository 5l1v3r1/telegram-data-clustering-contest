      <h1>Crisis: Ralph Dibny Jokingly References Classic DC Superteam in New Footage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:12:35+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Stone</a></address>
      <p>One episode in and "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" has already lived up to its promise as the biggest, most ambitious television crossover event of all time, gathering the heroes from across DC's entire history of TV and film.</p>
      <p>Now, the CW has released a new behind-the-scenes featurette showing the various casts assembling and comparing notes and costumes interspersed with short clips of previously unseen footage. Among them is an off-the-cuff remark from Ralph Dibney as he presumably meets <i>Kingdom Come</i> Superman for the first time.</p>

      <p>"Holy All-Star Squadron," a visibly awestruck Ralph says, referencing the classic DC superteam as Killer Frost tells the others to ignore her colleague as it's his first crossover.</p>
      <p>Created by Roy Thomas, Rich Buckler and Jerry Ordway, the All-Star Squadron -- who debuted in <i>Justice League of America</i> #193 in 1981 -- was a conglomerate of the Justice Society of America, Freedom Fighters, Seven Soldiers of Victory and various individual superheroes to aid the Allied Powers in winning World War II. Whether more Golden Age heroes are slated to join in the Crisis remains to be seen.</p>
