      <h1>Watford have asked about signing – Hornets only want January loan deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:33:09+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/naveen-ullal/" target="_blank">Naveen Ullal</a></address>
      <p>Watford maintained their interest in Barcelona’s Jean-Clair Todibo after failing to sign him before the start of the season.</p>
      <p>On November 21st, we <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/club-received-offer-from-watford-for-player-transfer-conditions-could-jeopardise-deal-for-hornets/">carried a report from Sport</a>, who explained the La Liga winners already have an offer from the Hornets for the centre-back.</p>
      <p>Monday’s edition of the <a href="https://www.sport.es/">same newspaper</a> claims Barca technical secretary Eric Abidal and his assistant Ramon Planes held talks with AC Milan chief Paolo Maldini last week and Tobido was discussed.</p>
      <p>Bayer Leverkusen and Watford also get a mention by the Catalan newspaper. Regarding the Premier League side, it’s claimed Nigel Pearson’s new club have asked the Spanish champions about the player.</p>

      <p>However, Todibo’s chances of moving to Vicarage Road in January have been ‘ruled out’ because the two clubs couldn’t find an agreement over the type of deal.</p>
      <p>Watford only want to sign the defender on loan, while Barcelona want a sale.</p>
      <p>Sport adds Leverkusen remain favourite to secure Todibo’s services, despite Milan joining the chase.</p>
