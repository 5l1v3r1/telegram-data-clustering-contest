      <h1>UK Labour’s McDonnell: Markets realize PM Johnson's promises on Brexit are not implementable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:40:44+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>"There wouldn't be a run on <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">the pound</a> under a Labour government, " opposition Labour Party’s Finance Policy Chief and the second most powerful man, John McDonnell, said on Monday. "All the evidence we have suggests pound would go up."</p>
      <p>McDonnell further argued that markets are aware that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's promises on Brexit are not "implementable."</p>
      <p>These comments were largely ignored by market participants as the Conservative Party is largely expected to win this week's election. As of writing, the GBP/USD pair was up 0.25% on the day at 1.3167.</p>
