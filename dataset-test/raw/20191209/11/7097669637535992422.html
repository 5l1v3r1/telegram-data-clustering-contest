      <h1>Melania Trump unveils White House Christmas decorations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:58:24+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/" target="_blank">Natacha Larnaud</a></address>
      <p>First lady Melania Trump has officially decked the halls of the White House. This year, the theme is "The Spirit of America." The 2019 decorative approach features glittery patriotism throughout 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. </p>
      <p>The official White House Christmas tree, which arrived the week before from Pitman, Pennsylvania, stands more than 18 feet and is decorated with handmade paper flowers that honor the floral symbols of all 50 states.</p>
      <p>The Gold Star Family tree in the White House's East Wing is decorated with golden stars, red bows and patriotic ribbons in honor of those who lost family members while serving. </p>
      <p>The Red Room is decorated with a "game room" theme, including card and board games as part of the decorations. The video shows a close-up of one of the trees with an ornament that says "Be Best" in Scrabble tiles, a reference to the first lady's child wellness initiative.</p>
      <p>The Grand Foyer is lit up in gold as faux snow dusts the floor and trees, and the East Colonnade features a white color scheme where three-dimensional stars hang from the ceiling and display a timeline of "American design, innovation and architecture."</p>
      <p> A gingerbread replica of the White House is featured in The State Dining Room. It is surrounded by U.S. landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty and the Golden Gate Bridge. This piece was created by The White House pastry team. </p>

      <p>Throughout December, the White House will host open houses and receptions for those who wish to see the decorations up close. </p>
