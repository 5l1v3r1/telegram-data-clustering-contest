        <b>DAVID THOMPSON has branded Celtic legend Chris Sutton's analysis of the flashpoint between Rangers' Alfredo Morelos and Christopher Jullien as a 'disgrace and misleading'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Liverpool midfielder, who played alongside <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5043411/rangers-celtic-brown-arfield-handshake/">Light Blues</a> boss Steven Gerrard for the Reds, took to social media to blast his BBC Radio 5 live colleague.</p>

      <p>TV cameras showed that Morelos caught the defender on the Achilles after he played a pass during<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5043540/rangers-0-celtic-1-betfred-cup-final/"> yesterday's Betfred Cup Final.</a></p>
      <p>Sutton describing the incident said: "Well he clears the ball here and Morelos there. I tell you what, that's naughty.</p>
      <p>"That's really naughty from Morelos. Had Willie Collum seen that I think he would be a goner. I do.</p>
      <p>"He's raked him down the back of the Achilles. He's late. He's over stepped the mark once again.</p>

      <p>"He wins the ball, Jullien plays it, one, two steps later. He's a lucky, lucky boy Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p>"He knows Christopher Jullien. I said Morelos walked the line this season - the right side of the line.</p>
      <p>"He's late there. He knows exactly what he wants to do. He knows where he is placing his feet."</p>
      <p>Thompson clearly didn't agree with Sutton's analysis of the incident and responded to the clip shared by BT Sport.</p>

      <p>He wrote on Twitter: "That is a disgrace and misleading.</p>
      <p>"Supposed to be an expert broadcaster there is zero malice in that unfortunate collision whatsoever.</p>
      <p>"Guilty by reputation only."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, talkSPORT host <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5045133/alan-brazil-alfredo-morelos-cheat-rangers-celtic-talksport/">Alan Brazil has branded Morelos a 'cheat'. </a></p>
      <p>The Colombian hitman was left to rue his day at Hampden after missing a barrel load of chances, including seeing his penalty saved by Fraser Forster.</p>
      <p>Morelos is yet to break his scoring duck against the Hoops - a run that has now extended to games.</p>
      <p>But Brazil was not happy with his performance at the national stadium as he claimed the hitman falls over too easily.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Neil Lennon's men were second best for much of the afternoon but took their big chance when it arrived.</p>
      <p>And they had Forster to thank at the other end for a number of stunning saves throughout the contest.</p>
