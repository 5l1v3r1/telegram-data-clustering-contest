        <b>A CHILD rapist who wrote a book based on his own campaign of abuse was killed by a severe heart attack behind bars, a sheriff has ruled.</b>
      </p>

      <p>The former classroom assistant wrote an account of sexual abuse mirroring his exploitation of a victim, which his wife handed in to police before he was due to stand trial.</p>
      <p>The book contained a chapter entitled 'Holiday' which he wrote from a child's viewpoint describing a young girl's gratitude towards him for "teaching her how to make love".</p>
      <p>A fatal accident inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that on March 20, 2019 he was three and a half years into his sentence at Saughton Prison when he collapsed on a stairwell after complaining of feeling unwell and sweaty at a presentation in the training room.</p>
      <p>Prison medical staff found him "incontinent of faeces, cold, clammy and sweating profusely".</p>

      <p>They called an ambulance which took him to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where an angiogram showed very severe heart disease, with three of his coronary arteries being blocked.</p>
      <p>Despite advanced cardiac catheter surgery to re-open his blood vessels, doctors found he had already suffered extensive heart muscle damage.</p>
      <p>After repeated cardiac arrests a DNACPR (Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) order was put in place.</p>
      <p>He suffered a further final, fatal cardiac arrest and died just before 8am the next day.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alistair Noble, who presided over the brief public probe, ruled: "Mr Mitchell's death was due to natural causes. No other findings are warranted on the evidence."</p>
      <p>Mitchell, from Kirknewton, West Lothian, abused his victims between 1988 and 2004 at at Almondell Country Park, East Calder, and at Bubbles Leisure Pool in Livingston.</p>
      <p>His trial heard how one woman he abused has scars on her arms from self-harming and suffers depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
      <p>The victim was regularly subjected to abuse by Mitchell from the age of five.</p>
      <p>Mitchell, a former classroom assistant at a West Lothian school who had acted as babysitter, later turned his attention to the woman's younger sister and abused her from the age of six.</p>
      <p>Imposing the jail term, Judge John Beckett QC told him: "You deployed inducement, manipulation and threats to inflict your grossly depraved conduct on innocent children."</p>
      <p>The judge said statements provided by the victims made "harrowing reading", adding: "In different ways you have traumatised all of your victims."</p>
      <p>Police described Mitchell as "a dangerous predator".</p>
