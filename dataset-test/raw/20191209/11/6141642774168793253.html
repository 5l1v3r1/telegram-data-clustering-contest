      <p>With Anthony Joshua becoming only the sixth boxer in history to reclaim the heavyweight title, the division promises another spectacular year in 2020.</p>
      <p>Following his unanimous points victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia on Saturday night to take the WBA, IBF and WBO titles back to Britain, Joshua vowed he would not call out potential opponents such as Deontay Wilder or Tyson Fury, and simply take it a fight at a time.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks at the state of the heavyweight division in the wake of Joshua’s win, and what we can expect next year.</p>
