      <p>Viewers of BBC1's His Dark Materials have taken to Twitter to praise the wardrobe of chief baddie Mrs Coulter (Ruth Wilson), hailing it 'the best thing on TV'. </p>

      <p>From the first episode, when Mrs Coulter strode into an Oxford college in a teal blue velvet blazer, fashion fans knew they would be in for a treat. </p>
      <p>The hits have continued episode after episode, taking in everything from liquid satin night gowns, meticulously tailored suits and a jaunty berry-coloured beret that has several fans on its own. </p>
      <p>Last night's installment - the sixth of eight in this first series - was no exception, with Mrs Coulter striding into her secret lair in a dramatic fur-lined coat. </p>
      <p>Underneath the look was just as a dramatic: a deep red, high neck dress with three-quarter sleeves that boasted a fashion-forward split on the lower arm. </p>

        <figcaption>Fans have responded with enthusiasm to Mrs Coulter's amazing looks. One declared she 'wants it all', while another said the outfits have 'won the show'</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The stunning outfits were enough to impress UK-based journalist Lauren Smith, who posted a selection of her favourite looks alongside the caption: 'Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter outfit appreciation post #hisdarkmaterials.' </p>
      <p>Other excited fans have responded with similar enthusiasm. One declared she 'wants it all', while another said the outfits have 'won the show'. </p>
      <p>Even those who confess to finding issues with the drama, an adaptation of Philip Pullman's beloved Northern Lights novel, confess that they can't resist the allure of Mrs Coulter's ensembles. </p>

        <figcaption>Even when lounging, as seen above, Mrs Coulter is the epitome of classic glamour</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Much of this is down to the sumptuousness of the fabrics. </p>
      <p>Viewers have watched Mrs Coulter slink around her penthouse in satin, storm through the Arctic in heavy faux fur or shake up academics in embellished velvet. </p>
      <p>Speaking to the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/dark-materials-costumes-story-behind-ruth-wilsons-glamorous/"><b> Daily Telegraph</b></a> last month, costume designer Caroline McCall told how these materials were deliberately chosen to make the character even more appealing to unsuspecting children, including her own daughter Lyra Belaqua (Dafne Keen). </p>
      <p>She explained: 'The textures of her clothing are tactile, and that velvet jacket has a twinkle and sparkle that children might be drawn to. There’s a softness to her clothing, at least in the beginning.'</p>
      <p>McCall, who designed the costumes for Downton Abbey, added that she drew heavily on the shapes and silhouettes of vintage clothing when creating looks for Mrs Coulter, who stands out for the power she holds in a patriarchal society. </p>
      <p>'We looked at clothes from the 1910s to 1950s, ultimately choosing pieces that created a timeless feel,' McCall continued. </p>
      <p>'They still shape a sense of glamour for modern women.'</p>
