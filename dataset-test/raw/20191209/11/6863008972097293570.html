      <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will meet in Paris following the negotiations in the so-called Normandy format (the summit of the leaders of Ukraine, France, Germany, and Russia).</p>
      <p>That's according to Yuriy Ushakov, an aide to the Russian president, RIA Novosti reports.</p>
      <p>"The meeting will be held after the completion of all events ... The organizers set the format of the summit, and it turned out that a convenient time is after all these events, after the summit of the Quartet," Ushakov said, adding that there are no time limits for the bilateral meeting.</p>
      <p>Ushakov called the discussion of the implementation of the Minsk Agreements the main goal of the leaders' meeting. "First of all, it's the implementation of the Minsk agreements [that will be discussed at the meeting between Putin and Zelensky]," said Ushakov.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Uskahov did not comment on whether gas issues would be discussed.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, the Russian Foreign Ministry had <a href="https://www.unian.info/politics/10785707-russia-opposes-initiative-on-expanding-normandy-format.html">opposed </a>the idea of expanding the Normandy format.</p>
