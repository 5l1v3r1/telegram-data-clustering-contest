      <p>The heart-warming scene was captured at <a href="http://www.panda.org.cn/"><b>Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Base</b></a> on August 28 and has been supplied to MailOnline by <a href="http://en.ipanda.com/"><b>iPanda</b></a>, a video platform which specialises in pandas.</p>
      <p>Cheng Feng was born on June 11 and is known for being mischievous among keepers, according to iPanda.  </p>
      <p>The tiny bear is known affectionately as the 'crazy cub' at the centre. </p>
      <p>The 40-second video shows Cheng Da lying on her back in her enclosure while Cheng Feng was resting on Cheng Da's stomach.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-four even put one of her legs on the railing of her cage while comforting her cub hands free. </p>

      <p>Cheng Feng is the third cub of Cheng Da and weighed 171.9 grams (six ounces) at birth.</p>
      <p>She has a twin sister, Cheng Lang, which is three and a half hours younger than her. </p>
      <p>Cheng Lang was the smallest cub to be born in the world. She weighed just 42.8 grams (1.5 ounces) and was lighter than a large egg.</p>

      <p>Keepers put Cheng Lang into an incubator and took care of her around the clock at the centre's panda nursery. </p>
      <p>She has since grown to nearly the same size of her sister Cheng Feng.</p>
      <p>The siblings met the public for the first time on September 24. </p>

      <p><b>Sports facilities: </b>The black-and-white bears enjoy a variety of leisure facilities in the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Base, such as <a href="http://pandafoundation.org/cn/dongtai/daxiongmao/2016-07-26/3811.html"><b>gym facilities made with bamboo</b></a> and dipping pools for the animals to cool down in summer.</p>
      <p><b>Birthday treats: </b>A lavish party is usually held and a luxurious cake is prepared for the birthday star, which can be made of fruits, ice and bamboo.<a href="http://www.panda.org.cn/big5/news/news/2015-09-11/5252.html"><b> </b></a></p>
      <p><b>Well-furnished delivery rooms: </b>They are set up for expectant panda mothers in the breeding centre in Chengdu. The Sun Delivery Room<b> </b>receives panda mothers during the day while the Moon Delivery Room helps the animal give birth at night.</p>
      <p><b>Fancy food menu: </b>More than 20 types of bamboo are offered by the Chengdu centre to ensure pandas dine like kings. Their favourite is said to be the bamboo shoots collected at altitudes higher than 6,560ft in <a href="http://www.panda.org.cn/china/news/xiongmaoquwen/2014-07-14/4071.html"><b>Bashan Mountain</b></a>. </p>
      <p><b>Cool rooms: </b>During summer, all pandas enjoy air-conditioned rooms. In 2016, a panda in Taipei Zoo tricked zookeepers into giving her an air-conditioned room, round-the-clock care and extra bamboo by pretending to be pregnant.</p>
      <p><b>Free match-making service: </b>A keeper at the Chengdu centre said in <a href="http://news.qq.com/a/20140502/001964.htm"><b>an interview </b></a>that she got up at 6am every day to pair female pandas to male pandas during the mating seasons. </p>
