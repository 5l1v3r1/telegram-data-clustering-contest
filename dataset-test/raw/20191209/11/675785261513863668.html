      <h2>In an awkward grilling the Prime Minister claimed he may honour his promise to stop Heathrow Airport's controversial third runway using his own body 'were the bulldozers to appear'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:50:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Squirming Boris Johnson today managed to repeat his infamous pledge to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop Heathrow Airport's third runway.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader admitted he would "have to find some way of honouring that promise" after being grilled by LBC host Nick Ferrari.</p>
      <p>But he stuttered and blustered his way over the details - and managed to give no commitment to how or when it will happen.</p>
      <p>Today's comments are likely to prove a major embarrassment for the Conservative leader if - as most people expect - he breaks the promise.</p>
      <p>In 2015 the MP - whose constituency is near the airport - promised he would "lie down with you in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway”.</p>

      <p>But when it came to a vote in Parliament, he fled on a £20,000 taxpayer-funded visit to Afghanistan to avoid voting against it - something which could have cost him his job as Foreign Secretary.</p>
      <p>Since then plans have been approved and are now well advanced - with legal challenges against it dismissed by the High Court.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has largely managed to avoid repeating his "bulldozers" pledge, and in June he appeared to water down his views saying he only had “grave reservations”.</p>
      <p>Today he at first refused to repeat it, telling LBC's Nick Ferrari: "I don't see much sign of any bulldozers yet."</p>

      <p>But pressed on whether he'd lie down in front of them "were the bulldozers to appear," Mr Johnson said: "I would have to find some way of honouring that promise.</p>
      <p>"It might be technically difficult to achieve, but, er, yes."</p>
      <p>Asked to confirm he'd find a technical way to lie down in front of the bulldozers, he said: "Let's wait and see when the bulldozers arrive."</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister added: "The issue with Heathrow as you know is there is still substantial doubt about the ability of the promoters to meet their obligations on air quality and noise pollution.</p>
      <p>"But as you know Parliament has voted very substantially in favour of that project so that's where we are on Heathrow."</p>
