      <p>It is expected that all weapons will be deactivated during the screening so you can sit and watch without someone smacking your head in with an axe. Director JJ Abrams is also set to appear on screen, presumably to introduce the scene.</p>
      <p>Star Wars fans are having a rather good few weeks as alongside the Fortnite treats Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has been released to critical acclaim.</p>
      <p>“Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is exactly the kind of single player game we had originally hoped to see when EA and Disney joined forces,” we said in out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">8/10 review.</a> “Even if you strip away the license, you’re left with a super satisfying mix or combat, story, and exploration, deftly crafted by a studio best known for spearheading an entirely different genre.”</p>
      <p>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens in a few days and is already breaking box office records for pre-sale tickets.</p>
      <p>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker content will start to be added to Battlefront II in a free update that drops on 17th December for PS4, Xbox One and PC. Star Wars Battlefront II is available now as part of EA Access, with the Celebration Edition out tomorrow, 5th December.</p>

      <p>There will be four new sequel era reinforcements to deploy as, with the strikingly red armoured Infiltrator class Sith trooper and the Jet Trooper for the First Order, and a new Gunner and Spy unit for the Resistance. And to make sure they’re all nice an up to date, Finn, Rey and Kylo Ren will be getting new Hero Appearances that can be bought for Credits or Crystals or are a part of the Celebration Edition.</p>
      <p>It will feature a brand new jungle planet that was featured in the most recent trailer for the film, adding it to Co-op alongside Takodana, Jakku and Starkiller Base, as a new location for Heroes vs. Villains. However, while all of the other content will drop on 17th December, you’ll have to wait until 20th December for the new planet.</p>
