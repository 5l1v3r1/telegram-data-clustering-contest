      <p>He had a tough start to the 2019/20 season, but Bafana Bafana now have a striker in form once again after Lebo Mothiba grabbed another goal and an assist this weekend.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old forward played a vital role in Strasbourg’s 4-2 win over Toulouse on Saturday, expertly setting up Adrien Thomasson to get them level after they’d fallen behind, before getting in among the goals himself.</p>
      <p>Having battled for match fitness after the 2019 African Cup of Nations, ‘Lebotelli’ has started to find his feet again in Ligue 1, and has now directly contributed to seven goals in his last six games for the club as they look to climb up the league table.</p>

      <p>With four goals and three assists to his name by December, the Bafana star is well on the way to beating his tally of 10 goals in the 2018/19 campaign, and could well make the 2019/20 season the best in his young career to date.</p>

      <p>Bafana head coach, Molefi Ntseki, will be eager to see the forward keep up this form in the coming months in the build-up to their 2022 World Cup qualifiers in March, with an in-form Mothiba certainly an asset for the South African national team.</p>
