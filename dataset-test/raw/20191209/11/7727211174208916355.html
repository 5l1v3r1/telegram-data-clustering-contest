      <h1>Man City fan's bitter rant against Liverpool after Pep Guardiola's side fall 14 points behind</h1>
      <h2>One Man City fan is not happy with the VAR decisions that he feels have gone against his team this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:01:42+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Caoimhe O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>One Manchester City fan has not held back on revealing his fury with league leaders Liverpool and VAR.</p>
      <p>The fan called into Robbie Savage's BBC Radio 5 Live call-in show arguing about decisions which he believes have gone against City this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/pep-guardiola-admits-man-city-17385942">Pep Guardiola's men now sit 14 points</a> behind Jurgen Klopp's side after falling to defeat in the Manchester derby on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The furious supporter, named as Gary, launched a six-minute rant against video assistant referee technology which was introduced at the start of the campaign.</p>
      <p>He argued six decisions had gone against the reigning champions and said as many as four had benefited <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-leicester-city-title-race-17385781">Liverpool.</a></p>
      <p>"I believe there's an underlying trend," Gary began. "The FA who took an extra 12 months to introduce the VAR don't want it to be introduced, they want everybody to hate it. Pep wanted it to come. A lot of people that believe the system can be fair wanted it to come in but it can also be seriously manipulated.</p>
      <p>"And the key is, I started from the games at the start of the season, started watching them back and I've watched the most recent ones.</p>
      <p>"Now I can highlight six times that the VAR decisions have gone against City and four times when the decisions have gone towards Liverpool. Now that's 10 decisions that have not gone in 16 games. I can highlight them where we don't get anything and Liverpool do."</p>
      <p>When asked to name the decisions which have gone against City by 606 host Robbie Savage, the fan argues: "We started with the first game of the season when we played West Ham.</p>
      <p>"We actually won 5-0 in the end. But when it was 2-0 and we were trying to kill the game off [Raheem] Sterling was an inch over, (offside) an inch. And at the time they said VAR is this wonderful thing. Even if it's an inch, it's an inch. And during the time we didn't make it 3-0 West Ham almost got back in the game."</p>
      <p>Savage then asks: "So was he an inch offside?" The fan admits: "He was an inch offside." To which Savage confirms: "So they got it right then. If he was he was an inch offside he was offside."</p>

      <p>The supporter then resumes his rant against Liverpool, arguing <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-mane-van-dijk-lovren-17383195">Virgil van Dijk</a> should have been sent off during the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-everton-dominance-continues-17365993">Reds' 5-2 win in the Merseyside derby</a>.</p>
      <p>He said: "Let's go back to the Everton game when Virgil van Dijk mowed down, when it was 2-1, he mowed down the player in the penalty area. I've never seen a clearer penalty in all my life, Van Dijk should have been sent off. I've never seen anybody knock somebody down in the penalty area like he did."</p>
      <p>Savage interrupts: "When was that?" Gary quickly explains: "Against Everton at 2-1, I played it ten times. He'd have been sent off on that match because he was the last man. It went to VAR and they didn't give it."</p>
      <p>The rant then continues for another three minutes and with the passionate fan going on to reference the stoppage time penalty Liverpool were awarded against Leicester City which earned the Reds a last-gasp win.</p>
      <p>The pair then debate the Manchester derby defeat before Olympic gold medallist Sam Quek interjects to bring the heated discussion to its conclusion.</p>
