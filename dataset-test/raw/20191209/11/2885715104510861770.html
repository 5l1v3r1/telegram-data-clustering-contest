      <p>Maharashtra <a href="http://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> leader Pankaja Munde, who is reportedly sulking since her defeat in the October 21 Assembly polls, on Monday remained absent for the party’s regional level meeting in Aurangabad.</p>
      <p>State BJP president Chandrakant Patil, however, said Pankaja remained absent with a prior permission as she was unwell.</p>
      <p>“I have spoken to Pankaja Munde before coming to Aurangabad for the meeting. She is ill. Moreover, preparations are going on for the December 12 rally. She remained absent with a prior permission,” Patil told reporters.</p>
      <p>The senior BJP leader said he would meet Pankaja in her hometown Parli in Beed district after two days.</p>
      <p>Pankaja, daughter of BJP stalwart late Gopinath Munde, had caused a flutter with her social media post on her future political journey in view of the “altered political scenario” in Maharashtra, where the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a> formed a government with the support of the NCP and Congress after snapping ties with former ally BJP.</p>
      <p>Pankaja, a former minister, had also appealed to her supporters to assemble at Gopinathgad–a memorial of her late father—in Beed district on December 12 on the occasion of his birth anniversary.</p>
      <p>She had also removed the word “BJP” from her twitter bio, triggering speculation about her future in the BJP.</p>
      <p>However, Pankaja later clarified that she was not leaving the BJP and that defection was not in her blood.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Patil accused former ally Shiv Sena of abandoning “Hindutva” for the sake of power.</p>
      <p>“The Shiv Sena has abandoned the agenda of Hindutva and joined hands with the Opposition parties,” he said.</p>
      <p>Patil said the BJP will contest the upcoming elections to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on its own.</p>
      <p>He said the BJP and the Sena had worked together in Aurangabad and also contested elections as pre-poll allies.</p>
      <p>“We have ruled this civic body together and carried out development works. But now the BJP will contest separately,” he added.</p>
