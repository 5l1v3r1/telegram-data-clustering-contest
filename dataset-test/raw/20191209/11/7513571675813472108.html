        <b>A coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to release Omoyele Sowore within 14 days or face mass action.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sowore was rearrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) last Friday — less than 24 hours after he was released on bail.</p>
      <p>He had spent 125 days in custody before he was briefly released last Thursday.</p>
      <p>The pro-democracy activist is accused of insulting the president, treasonable felony and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the coalition on Monday, Yemi Ademolekun, convener of Enough is Enough (EIE), said the shrinking of the media and civic space calls for concern, and that there is a need to rise up against any action of the government that will stifle free speech.</p>
      <p>While listing five demands, she asked the president to obey all pending court orders and order the release of all those illegally arrested.</p>
      <p>“The five demands includes; President Muhammadu Buhari should show accountability as commander-in-chief and address the nation on his commitment to the rule of law and human rights,” the EIE convener said.</p>
      <p>“The release of all illegally detained persons by Department of State Service (DSS) as reviewed by Amnesty International, Premium Times and Punch newspaper in recent times.</p>
      <p>“That the government obey all pending court orders. An investigation of the officer who violated protocols and circumstances leading circumstances leading to the second arrest of Omoyele Sowore.</p>
      <p>“Unconditional release of Omoyele Sowore.”</p>
      <p>She said if these demands are not met within the time given, they would occupy all the offices of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) nationwide.</p>
      <p>“If these five demands are not honoured within 14 days, we call on patriots across Nigerians to join us to join us as we occupy National Human Rights Commission offices across the country as it is legally mandated to protect Nigerians and also report to presidency,” Ademolekun said.</p>
