      <h1>“We can’t give the money they want” – Club chief quizzed about signing Everton player</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:33:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p>Besiktas president Ahmet Nur Cebi has spoken to <a href="https://twitter.com/demarkesports/status/1203262762677354497">Hayatta Besiktas Radio station </a>about the latest developments at the club and their links with Everton forward Cenk Tosun.</p>
      <p>The Turkey international has been linked with a return to his former club following his struggles with Everton.</p>
      <p>However, Cebi has said claims of a Besiktas move for Tosun aren’t true, because they don’t have the resources to complete a deal with the Premier League side: <i>“I heard rumours about Anderson Talisca, Vincent Aboubakar and Cenk Tosun returning. None of them are true. Unfortunately, we closed these chapters. We can’t give the money they want.”</i></p>
      <p>Tosun joined the Merseyside club from Besiktas in 2018, however, he’s struggled to get regular first-team football, especially this season.</p>
      <p>He’s started just two Premier League games in this campaign, and could be looking to leave Everton in the new year, especially with him needing minutes to be sharp for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The 28 year old’s contract with Everton will expire at the end of June 2022.</p>
