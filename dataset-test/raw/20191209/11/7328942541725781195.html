      <p>In what may be the oddest news this week, Auction house RR Auction <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/PastAuctionItem/3420447">has just sold</a> a floppy disk with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' signature for a whopping <b>$84,000</b>. The floppy disk is dated to about 1988 and contains Macintosh System Tools 6.0 software. </p>

      <h3>A reluctant signer</h3>
      <p>The reason it went for that much, claims the auction house, is that Jobs rarely gave out his signature. "A hugely desirable format for Jobs's seldom-seen autograph—known as a reluctant signer, he often declined to comply with the requests of collectors," reads RR Auction's item description.</p>
      <p>The firm also said the disk was in "fine condition, with slight brushing to the ink." "As a piece of Apple's iconic Mac OS software, boasting Jobs's elegantly stylish lowercase signature, this is a museum-quality piece of computing history," further reads the posting.</p>
      <p>Initially, the item was estimated to have a value of just <b>$7,500</b>. This is not the first of Jobs' items to sell for an exorbitant amount.</p>
      <h3>A history of pricy auctions</h3>
      <p>Last August, a "Toy Story" movie poster signed by Jobs went up for auction at of <b>$25,000</b>. In addition, a commemorative plaque and a copy of Mac world both with the late CEO's signature went up for auction at <b>$15,000</b> and <b>$10,000</b> respectively.</p>
      <p>Finally, last but definitely not least, last year, a job application by the entrepreneur written in 1973 sold for a mind-boggling <b>$174,000</b>. What do you think about these items? Are they a waste of money or valuable mementos meant to be cherished?</p>
