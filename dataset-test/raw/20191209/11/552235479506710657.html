      <h1>Hearts to kick start sporting director search with Daniel Stendel finally in the door</h1>
      <h2>Process stalled as new manager became the priority but will now resume with Stendel in post</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:23:09+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:23</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts will now turn their attention to appointing a sporting director to work alongside Daniel Stendel after making him their new boss.</p>
      <p>The German was announced as the club’s new manager on a two-and-a-half year deal on Saturday night in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">the Jambos’</a> 1-0 Scottish Premiership defeat to Motherwell at Fir Park.</p>
      <p>It brings to an end almost six weeks of searching, interviewing and negotiating, with the 45-year-old set to start work at the club’s Oriam training base on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge’s</a> initial plan had been to recruit a sporting director before appointing a new head coach, but priorities shifted and identifying and interviewing managerial candidates became their primary concern.</p>
      <p>The protracted nature of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Stendel’s</a> appointment meant that any progress on the sporting director front was stalled as Budge focused all her efforts on getting that deal over the line.</p>

      <p>Now that’s been confirmed, the club will set about finding the man who will essentially be tasked with going out and getting the players Stendel wants to mould the Hearts squad in his image.</p>
      <p>Budge confirmed after Craig Levein’s departure that there would be scope for the new man to make additions during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The sporting director will handle the logistical aspect of signing the targets identified by Stendel, although will not be involved with any aspect of the first team aside from recruitment, with the manager reporting directly to Budge.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether recent interim boss Austin MacPhee is a candidate. Levein’s former assistant took the reins during the recruitment process, and is due to discuss his future with Budge and Stendel at some point this week.</p>
      <p>Hull City head of recruitment Lee Darnbrough and Preston North End’s Lee Savage were both linked with the role shortly after it’s creation was announced.</p>
      <p>Alan Irvine could also be a candidate. The former Everton coach was interviewed for the manager’s position last month, but his experience working behind the scenes at big clubs down south and previously heading up Blackburn and Newcastle’s academies mean he could be well suited to the sporting director role.</p>
