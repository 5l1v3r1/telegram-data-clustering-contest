      <p>Part of security arrangement, Delhi Police earlier in the day, had deployed security forces on every gate of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Apart from this, the police had also sealed all the gates of the varsity to refrain students’ from holding any protest over the fee hike issue.</p>

      <p>The students resorted to protest again as the JNU administration rejected their demand for complete rollback of the proposed hike in hostel charges.</p>
      <p>Writing a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind, the students of JNU demanded complete rollback of proposed fee hike, the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor, withdrawal of police cases on the agitating students.</p>
