        <figcaption>Puppy with ‘second tail’ growing from his head</figcaption>

      <p>The tiny puppy with an extra tail on his head - resembling the horn of a unicorn - which was found abandoned on a freezing cold street in Missouri and taken in by animal rescue charity centre Mac's Mission has now found a forever home.</p>
      <p>After arriving at the shelter earlier this year Narwhal the “unicorn dog” was taken to a vet who found the tail was not usable by the dog and caused him no harm or obstruction and it would not be needed to have surgery to remove it, just because he had 'been given extra parts during assembly'.</p>
      <p>After being cleared for adoption hundreds of applications flooded through to home the dog, forming one of the 'the longest adoption lines in history', reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/narwhal-unicorn-rescue-puppy-found-21037339">The Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>Narwhal stole the hearts of thousands of people across the globe begging to adopt the dog after Mac’s Mission found him on a snowy street being looked after by an older dog.</p>
      <p>But among the outpouring of love there were also a few unsettling encounters - including unannounced guests at the center, sick death threats towards the dog and offers of cash.</p>
      <p>Employees feared he could be exploited for his fame or even hurt resulting in him being kept in sight of trusted volunteers at all times, reports the Southeast Missourian.</p>

      <p>So to prevent any abuse of the helpless beagle mix he has now been adopted by to Rochelle Steffen, founder of Missouri Macs Mission.</p>
      <p>She said: "I had no intention initially of keeping him as I didn’t want a puppy but Narwhal is absolutely, exactly what we needed.”</p>
      <p>After more than 17,836 messages piled up asking for the center to keep the dog Rochelle said: "It’s not just a decision from me. The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him."</p>
      <p>Rochelle founded the center after the adoption of now nine year old Mac the Pitbull, and there are plans for Narwhal to step into his shoes as the centre's spokesdog, spreading the message that 'different is awesome'.</p>
      <p>The shelter also plans to train the dog as a therapy pup to help people in places like schools and nursing homes.</p>
      <p>Fans were overjoyed to hear of Mac's new home with the charity, with one saying: "My prayers have been answered. I was worried he wouldn't get the best home in the world. Mac's house is the best one!"</p>
      <p>Another replied: "This absolutely made my day. I was worried what might happen to little Narwhal if he were adopted.”</p>
      <p>"He will have a wonderful life with Mac and everyone. He is loved by so many that now we can continue to share his adventures through you and the rest of the team."</p>
