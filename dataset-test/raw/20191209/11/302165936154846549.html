      <p>LOS ANGELES, Dec 9 — Actor Rene Auberjonois, known for his television roles on <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i> and the US sitcom <i>Benson</i>, died yesterday in Los Angeles after a battle with cancer. He was 79.</p>
      <p>“We are heartbroken to confirm that Rene passed away today,” a statement on the actor’s website said.</p>
      <p>In his official biography, the cause given was metastatic lung cancer.</p>
      <p>Auberjonois earned legions of fans for his role as Odo, the shape-shifting head of security on <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i>, one of the many spinoff series spawned by the legendary science fiction show.</p>
      <p>He became a fan favourite at <i>Star Trek</i> conventions for years, donating the proceeds from autographed items to charities, such as Doctors Without Borders.</p>
      <p>“I have had my share of successes and my share of flops. But nothing has ever been like this. <i>Deep Space Nine</i> is completely beyond anything that I have ever experienced,” the actor once said.</p>
      <p>But he also was known for his portrayal in the 1980s of Clayton Endicott III, the chief of staff to a governor on the long-running sitcom <i>Benson</i>.</p>
      <p>Other career highlights include his appearance in Robert Altman’s 1970 film <i>MASH</i> as Father Mulcahy; a role on the quirky TV drama <i>Boston Legal</i>; and a host of voice roles in animated fare, including his performance as Chef Louis in Disney’s <i>The Little Mermaid</i>.</p>
      <p>Auberjonois, the son of a writer, grew up in Paris and New York, where his family lived in an artists’ colony.</p>
      <p>After university, he broke into showbiz on the stage, and earned a Tony award for his first Broadway musical, <i>Coco</i> — about the life of French fashion designer Coco Chanel — opposite Katharine Hepburn in the title role.</p>
      <p><i>Star Trek</i> star William Shatner — who worked with Auberjonois on <i>Boston Legal</i> — led tributes on Twitter, remembering his “wonderful friendship” with the actor, and fellow series regular George Takei called it a “terrible loss.”</p>
      <p>“When I look out to the stars, I shall think of you, friend,” Takei wrote.</p>
      <p>Auberjonois is survived by his wife Judith and two children, Tessa and Remy-Luc. — AFP</p>
