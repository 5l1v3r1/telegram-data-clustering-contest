      <p>The increase apparently reflected the upcoming deadline for the repatriation of North Korean workers under a United Nations resolution, pundits said.</p>
      <p>In response to the North's launch of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November 2017, the U.N. adopted a resolution ordering its members to repatriate North Korean workers back to Pyongyang by Dec. 22 this year.</p>
      <p>The airport's flight schedule shows that there will only be one flight a week connecting the two cities after the deadline.</p>
      <p>Air Koryo is the only airline that operates flights connecting Pyongyang and Vladivostok.</p>
      <p>"We can assume (that North Korea increased the flights to relocate the workers), but we cannot know the details behind the decision," a source with knowledge of the matter said. (Yonhap)</p>
