      <p>Manipur fast bowler Rex Singh is once again making heads turn. On Monday, the left-arm pacer starred with the ball during Manipur’s match against Mizoram on the opening day of 2019-’20 Ranji Trophy season at Jadavpur University Ground in Salt Lake on Monday.</p>
      <p>Batting first in the Plate Group match, Mizoram were bundled out for just 65 in just under an hour with Rex Singh being the wrecker-in-chief. The 19-year-old registered figures of 8-4-22-8 and five of the batsmen who he dismissed, were out for nought.</p>

      <p>The youngster later scored an unbeaten fifty as Manipur finished the day with 255/7 at stumps, accumulating a lead of 190 runs.</p>
      <p>Singh first grabbed the headlines last year when he claimed 10 wickets during a Cooch Behar Trophy game against Bihar in December. His heroics earned him a promotion to the U-19 Indian cricket team, becoming the first player from his state to be drafted in the national setup.</p>
      <p>Earlier last month, he even made his Twenty20 debut for Manipur during the 2019-’20 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy against Rajasthan.</p>
      <p>Born in Imphal, Singh started playing cricket with tennis ball in his backyard. As reported by <i><a href="https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ranji-trophy-2019-20-rex-singh-picks-eight-wickets-manipur-vs-mizoram-james-anderson/article30248707.ece">Sportstar</a></i>, he was initially interested in football and taekwondo, but switched to cricket on the recommendation of his coach Ph Rohendro Singh.</p>
      <p>“My coach advised me to bowl with leather ball and I just followed him. That helped me gain confidence,” he said</p>
      <p>“After that, I have worked on my bowling and mastered left-arm swing. That has helped me immensely and later, when I travelled to the National Cricket Academy, I learned how to develop overall skills. I am reaping those benefits,” Singh added.</p>
