      <p>A man who presented himself as the perfect partner was branded "boyfriend from hell" after abusing a woman he met on a dating website.</p>
      <p>Julie Emms was so happy with Dennis Beastall that he moved into her Glenfield flat, Leicestershire, a week after they met online on Plenty of Fish.</p>
      <p>Beastall, formerly of Swadlincote, Derby, soon seized control of her life, Leicester Crown <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>He allegedly dictated the clothes she wore and who she could remain friends with.</p>
      <p>The heavy drinker spent £2,000 of Ms Emms' money on booze and tobacco during their five month on and off relationship,  <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/i-thought-man-met-online-3617254?_ga=2.96903960.626062358.1575884741-920413543.1573567667">Leicestershire Live reports</a>.</p>

      <p>The court heard how he would turn violent and intimidating, once menacingly threatening to slash her throat.</p>
      <p>He once allegedly said: "I'll petrol bomb your flat."</p>
      <p>When the woman tried to end the relationship, he kicked and punched her on the head and body.</p>
      <p>Beastall apologised and continued to win back her affection following further violence, including ripping one of her earrings out.</p>
      <p>Following one break-up, she returned home and he jumped out of a cupboard to attack her.</p>
      <p>On a separate occasion, she discovered he was hiding in her attic when he fell through the ceiling.</p>

      <p>Beastall, 47, was found guilty, following a magistrates' court trial, of three common assaults, controlling and coercive behaviour, making a threat to kill and damage by smashing panels in the victim's front door.   </p>
      <p>He denied the offences.</p>
      <p>Ms Emms, 50, had to relive events in the witness box - with images of the injuries he inflicted being shown in court.</p>
      <p>Beastall, who has 75 previous convictions, including "numerous for harassment of previous partners," was committed to Leicester Crown Court for sentence.</p>
      <p>Catherine Ricardo, prosecuting, said: "The complainant and defendant met on a dating website on May 10 this year.</p>
      <p>"Although, at times, he was loving towards her, he became controlling. She was told what to wear, including her underwear.</p>
      <p>"She was told to change her contact details on her mobile phone and to get rid of contacts on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>"On May 30, Beastall was demanding to know her whereabouts when she simply went out to get her nails done."</p>

      <p>When she returned home, he was naked and drinking heavily in the flat which resulted in an argument and she told him to leave.</p>
      <p>Ms Ricardo said: "He kicked her whilst wearing trainers, including kicking her forcefully on the head and body and repeatedly punched with clenched fists.</p>
      <p>"She was on the floor curled up and screaming for help."</p>
      <p>Afterwards he sent her a message saying: "If you call the police I will kill you."</p>
      <p>The victim, who suffered a bruised wrist and forearm and a lump on her face, later told the police: "He was very aggressive, as if he was fighting a man."</p>
      <p>Beastall moved out for a while, but after his return he became jealous when he heard Ms Emms had been in contact with the daughter of a former partner, during a visit to her sister.</p>
      <p>Gesturing a finger across his neck, Beastall told Ms Emms, in front of her sister: "I'm going to kill you, I'm going to slash your throat."</p>
      <p>When she went home after some time, he jumped out of an alcove cupboard in the dark and punched her to her head and right eye.</p>
      <p>Ms Ricardo said: "It was terrifying and she fell backwards."</p>
      <p>He shouted abuse and repeatedly bashed her with a rucksack.</p>
      <p>The court heard the victim, who was "petrified" of the defendant, made two retraction statements at his behest.</p>
      <p>Ms Ricardo said: "She still feels terrified and is paranoid about him waiting for her in the dark.</p>
      <p>"She says she's an emotional wreck with flashbacks, anxiety and depression."</p>
      <p>Whilst in custody, he sent her a letter asking for forgiveness and was still trying to win her back. </p>
      <p>Judge Robert Brown told Beastall: "I have to sentence you for acts of violence against Ms Emms when you were together.</p>
      <p>"You pleaded not guilty and she had to give evidence at trial.</p>
      <p>"It was a course of conduct and you have a bad record for common assault and harassment.</p>
      <p>The judge said to the defendant: "You've taken a realistic attitude and I hope you're right when you tell me the relationship is over."</p>
      <p>Beastall said: "I've got someone else so I have no reason to contact her."</p>
      <p>Ms Emms told the court she now plans on moving address. </p>
      <p>The defendant said a restraining order would prevent him from collecting his belongings from the victim's home.</p>
      <p>Ms Emms said she had given his possessions to charity, on the suggestion of his brother.</p>
      <p>Beastall threw his arms in the air in the dock and angrily shouted: "That's all my stuff gone."  </p>
      <p>He then asked what had happened to his money.</p>
      <p>Ms Emms, who was accompanied by a Women's Aid support worker, produced the defendant's bank card and handed it to a court usher saying: "I haven't touched his bank account."</p>
      <p>As Beastall continued to grumble, the judge interrupted him, saying: "You had a good go at drinking your way through this lady's money."</p>
      <p>Kelly Cyples, mitigating, said: "He's from the Derby area and no reason to come back to Leicester.</p>
      <p>She said: "He accepts the finding of guilt by the magistrates and having heard the views of Ms Emms accepts the relationship is over and that she doesn't wish any further contact."</p>
      <p>Ms Cyples said the defendant was "struggling with alcohol consumption" at the time, consuming nine or 10 cans of lager at least every other day, which "impacted on his functioning."</p>

      <p>Beastall was jailed for 12 months.</p>
      <p>He was placed on a five year restraining order banning contact with Ms Emms.</p>
      <p>Ms Emms said afterwards: "I'm disappointed with the sentence, it should have been a lot longer.</p>
      <p>"He was the most amazing person when I first met him, a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>"He could turn the charm on like a tap, but his mood could quickly change and he got nastier after a drink.</p>
      <p>"It all began to change after two weeks.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't allowed any male friends on Facebook - he deleted them - he was always on my phone.</p>
      <p>"I was isolated from my family and friends, who didn't like him.</p>
      <p>"He told me I was the first woman he'd assaulted, which wasn't true - he was always sorry afterwards and somehow kept winning me round.</p>
      <p>"I was shocked to learn he had so many previous convictions, including violence towards former partners - if I'd known that I'd have run a mile.</p>
      <p>"I'm speaking out to help protect other women."</p>
      <p>When asked what her advice would be to those seeking love online, she told LeicestershireLive: "If you go on a dating website vet that person before you entertain even meeting them, you don't know who they are - I ended up with an animal.</p>
      <p>"He was the boyfriend from hell."</p>
      <p>Ms Emms met Dennis George Beastall, known as "Billy" on the Plenty of Fish (POF) dating site.</p>
      <p>She said: "His profile photo was taken when he was younger and better looking.</p>
      <p>"He was also on the Badoo site and used profile names, including Billy Breaker Beastall and Billy Rooster Beastall."</p>
