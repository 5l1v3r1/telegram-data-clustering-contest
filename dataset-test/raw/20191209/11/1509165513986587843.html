      <h3>Brett Brown (PHI)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>On what happened late in the game…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Some of the passing decisions were things that you have to get better with. I’m not really too sure on how to address some of it. You just scratch your head and try and coach better. It is disappointing that way that ended because I thought, for the most part, that we played good basketball. The way that it ended leaves a sour taste in your mouth, but then I’m reminded that it was a good weekend and we just beat the NBA champions. There are a lot of good things that came out of tonight, just the last part wasn’t one of them.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On whether the second group is looking like he wants it to look…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>We’re trending in that direction. I like the speed, the versatility. Matisse Thybulle is moving forward and I like the way that he is trending. I thought that, offensively, for a large portion of the game we were good against a really good offensive team. That group [Al at center, with Ben and Matisse on the court] is starting to take a shape that I wished it did when I first anointed them a ‘bomb squad.’</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On what he enjoyed most from </b>
        <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296600/tobias-harris">
          <b>Tobias Harris</b>
        </a>
        <b> tonight…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>There was a funny part of the game where he just went bucket, bucket and it spun out into 18 points. In general, he is in a good place offensively. That structure in his world is appropriate and I think he’s learning how to use it. We are playing well around him, off him. He’s had a really good mindset lately to score.<br/>Tobias was good and has been good as of late, especially trying to find the rim.</blockquote>

        <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/246140/joel-embiid">
          <b>Joel Embiid</b>
        </a>
        <b>’s performance tonight…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I think that his energy and his presence tonight was good. At the end, they pressed and he had some rough decisions. It’s unfortunate because for the large part of the game, he’s one of the main reasons we won. It won’t jump out to you on the stat sheet, but it’s <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/326057/joel-embiid">Joel Embiid</a> and his length. You can feel his presence really affected their rim work.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On Matisse’s night tonight…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>He does [look more confident shooting the three]. He takes his shots confidently and doesn’t blink. In general, he’s playing with the balance and he’s playing with the spirit. For sure, he is trending upwards. You feel it with the group and you can feel it with him. He’s getting far more confident and far more aware of what his role is.</blockquote>
      <h3>Joel Embiid (PHI)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>On how good it feels to get this win against Toronto…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>It feels good. We have a few bad memories playing against them, so it feels great. I’m happy that we got the win.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On what it felt like watching Matisse play so well tonight…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>He’s been great the whole season and he’s bringing it every night, especially defensively. Even though we have so many guys that can score the ball, him adding what he’s been adding, especially his shooting, has been tremendous.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On getting people in foul trouble early on…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Going into the game, you just want to be aggressive. It starts with me and if I’m aggressive, I know that our guys are going to follow. That was the mindset going into the game.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On the way Ben has been playing these last two games…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>It’s great. It’s great for him and it’s great for his mindset. It’s great to see him play like that. I didn’t play last night, but it was amazing to watch him play. I told him today that we needed the same energy and I felt like he did.</blockquote>
      <h3><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296601/tobias-harris">Tobias Harris</a> (PHI)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>On how he’s felt with his offensive play thus far…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I think I’m in a really good rhythm of just going out and embracing and feeding off my teammates and getting into a flow. I pride myself on playing in the flow of the game. I’ve done a really good job of being able to do that and being able to have guys on the team look for me in different spots and get me going. Coach has done a really good job of having that rhythm come our way a little bit faster.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On what he’s seen out of Matisse on offense recently…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Matisse is great. I was telling him in there [locker room], “don’t let the last minute and 30 seconds kill your vibe of that game because you really helped us win that game tonight.” I thought his energy was amazing. He was able to knock down big shots, big threes, that really pushed our lead each and every time they tried to make a run. He was amazing out there. I mean, he’s an amazing player, an amazing person, an amazing rookie, too. Every night I’m on him, each and every game, to continue to progress and continue to stay ready and locked in. He’s really catching his stride now.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On his leadership role and the leadership roles around the team…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>You know, overall, we’re having a lot of guys step up. Like tonight, it’s kind of uncommon when you see a rookie come off the bench and pretty much propel us to a win and make shots like that, like Matisse did. It speaks volumes to what type of player he is… to the potential he has. Also, on the defensive end, making plays and being able to be a stopper out there. I think we’re getting different nights from different guys that are stepping up. Ben last night was just dominant, and I think everyone was flowing off of that yesterday. Today, we just came out to get another win and we look to do that next home game.</blockquote>
      <h3>Matisse Thybulle (PHI)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>On what helps him contribute like he has…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I think it’s the confidence that my teammates and the coaches have in me. Knowing that they believe in me and that they have trust in me to go out there, make plays, and contribute is huge for my own personal confidence. I think that translates. I know that their support has been huge for me coming in and knowing that they trust me to make these shots helps me make them.</blockquote>

          <b>Tobias Harris</b>
        </a>
        <b>…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Aside from being an amazing example, he’s been like a big brother. We sit next to each other on every flight and he’s constantly giving me advice. I seek him for all my questions, whether it’s financially, on the court, off the court, I go to him. He’s done it at a very high level for a while now, and I really look up to him in that sense. He’s been a really good role model for me.</blockquote>

          <b>76ers</b>
        </a>
        <b> and what it means to him…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I really find myself thinking about it a lot. Even if six months ago you had told me I’d be in the position I’m in today, it would’ve been really hard for me to believe you. I think I’m incredibly blessed, I’m so grateful, and to have the guys that we have on this team and to have the opportunity that I have, is nothing short of a blessing.</blockquote>
      <h3><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/199151/nick-nurse">Nick Nurse</a> (TOR)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>On the team’s rhythm…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Our rhythm wasn’t great. We didn’t shoot it great. It seemed like every time we did make a nice little momentum four, five, six-point run, there was a play that ended up in a free throw, or they bang an open three. We miss a coverage and they get the momentum right back. You can only go through that so many times. Tonight was not our night.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On team integration…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I think we’re integrating some guys back in. We have to make sure we keep going professionally each night. Again, I think we played extremely good basketball. We had a couple tough ones on the road against some good teams. We have to keep plugging away at the schedule and get guys back in the rhythm a little bit.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On the offense…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The offense maybe wasn’t spectacular, but it was pretty composed and pretty smart. The rhythm has changed a bit with a couple different pieces in there just not quite executing at a high enough, fast enough level.</blockquote>

          <b>Serge Ibaka</b>
        </a>
        <b> rejoining the team…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I really think we have to figure it out. I missed 11 games and Serge missed many games, too. You get everybody back and guys have to figure out things again. They won a bunch of games without Serge and I there. They played hard and were in a rhythm, but you have to integrate us back in. We’re part of this team.<br/>It’s tough, but it’s the NBA. You gotta play. We have to figure out how to work as a team, as a group, and everybody has to figure out their roles in the situation.</blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>On how to improve…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>We have to get back to being us and playing basketball the way that we play. Kind of like impose our will a little bit more. These past three games, we’ve been passive and not ourselves.</blockquote>

        <b>On playing through injuries…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Just trying to play through injuries, it’s part of the game, it’s part of the season. I had a little discomfort and I wasn’t able to be myself out there. We made the decision to call it a night and try again tomorrow.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>On the team’s defense…</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Overall, it just feels like our offense isn’t helping our defense and our defense is not at the level it needs to be. I’m sure there’s some give and take there.</blockquote>
