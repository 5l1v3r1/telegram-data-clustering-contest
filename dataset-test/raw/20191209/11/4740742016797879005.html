      <p>Motorists endured severe rush hour delays in Bristol today (December 9).</p>
      <p>Two lanes were shut on the M32 northbound between Junction 3 (St Pauls) and Junction 2 (Eastville) while emergency pothole repairs were carried out.</p>
      <p>Traffic was reduced to a standstill, according to an eyewitness, with queues stretching back to the city centre near Cabot Circus.</p>

      <p>The lanes had re-opened by 8.10am, but delays remained for another hour or so.</p>
      <p>Repairs on the same section of road<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/live-m32-closed-traffic-m4-3618803"> took place on Saturday</a> (December 7), with Highways England describing the task as "emergency pothole repair".</p>
      <p>Elsewhere today, delays were also experienced on the A369 coming into Bristol with a lane closed at the turning for the Clifton Suspension Bridge at Bridge Road.</p>
      <p>One motorist said: "I saw the lane closed on Sunday and so today I knew it was going to be bad so set off much earlier. The lane was still closed and traffic was backing up.</p>
      <p>"I'm curious to know what it is for."</p>
      <p>The lane closure was not listed under this week's scheduled roadworks by Bristol City Council.</p>
