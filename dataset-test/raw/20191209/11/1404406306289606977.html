      <p>Fox Sports' Jay Glazer is reporting that Odell Beckham Jr. wants out of Cleveland, and he's allegedly been talking to opposing coaches and players before games and telling them to "come get me." </p>
      <p>Glazer explained, "Odell Beckham has told other players and coaches before games, during games, 'Hey, come get me.' I don't see that relationship ending well for them after this year."</p>
      <p>This comes after OBJ himself said that he's not sure what the future holds for him in Cleveland, telling the media, "No one knows what the future holds tomorrow. I couldn’t tell you. My locker is right next to one of the people that mean the most to me in the world. I think about coming to work and seeing him every single day and how special this could be, so I couldn’t sit here and tell you whether I’m going to be here, want to be here, don’t want to be here. This is exactly where I’m at right now, and I wouldn’t rather be anywhere else."</p>
      <p>OBJ also said on Twitter last week that he's "hopeful for better results" from the Browns amid their 5-7 record, which puts them out of the playoff picture. Odell is currently injured with a sports hernia that will require surgery in the offseason, but he has yet to miss a game due to his injury. </p>
