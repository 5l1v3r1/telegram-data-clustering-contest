      <p>Despite their form this season Villeneuve doesn't believe Honda will be able to provide an engine capable of competing with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> in the long run.</p>
      <p><i>“Honda is not on the same level because their power units aren’t able to do seven consecutive races,”</i> the Canadian told <a href="https://www.motorsport-total.com/formel-1/news/villeneuve-warum-red-bull-auch-2020-kein-titelkandidat-ist-19120605">motorsport-total.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Despite being critical of Honda, Villeneuve was full of praise for Max Verstappen, who was many people's driver of the season.</p>
      <p><i>“He drove fast and was focused, a surprise and really impressive but if Honda does not deliver a top engine, it won’t be enough for next year,"</i> he added.</p>
