      <h1>Daisy Ridley isn't scared of the Star Wars curse</h1>

        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> actress Daisy Ridley won’t be going down the same cursed and regrettable path as the previous leading men and women.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 27-year-old actress avoids parties, drinking and drugs at all costs as she’s ‘pretty responsible’.</p>
      <p>Daisy said: ‘I’m not really scared. I get to do a really great thing with a great group of people.</p>
      <p>‘I’m already involved with other awesome things but I’m sure I’ll always be compared to Star Wars, and I’ll always be thankful for what I’ve been able to do.’</p>
      <p>Considering Daisy prefers tea to alcohol and knows being a party animal while being part of the Star Wars franchise is difficult, we don’t think the ‘curse’ will be a problem.</p>
      <p>She revealed: ‘I think I’m pretty responsible, which is a good thing. I’m just not that person to go out and get crazy.</p>
      <p>‘I like to be at home and drink tea. I’m not a massive drinker, I don’t take drugs — all of those things that I think are so boring.</p>

      <p>‘If you like to party and you get a job like this, that’s tricky, because you have to figure that out.’</p>
      <p>Previous Star Wars actors – including Mark Hamill, Jake Lloyd, Hayden Christensen and Carrie Fisher – struggled with the fame and turned to sex, drugs, and C-list movies.</p>
      <p>Jake played a young Anakin Skywalker in 1999’s The Phantom Menace, unfortunately, ended up in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
      <p>Hayden, on the other hand, played a teen Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith and ended up starring in endless unmemorable movies.</p>
      <p>Carrie, who died aged 60 in 2016, became addicted to drugs after playing Princess Leia.</p>
      <p>A post mortem found she had taken cocaine, heroin and ecstasy before her death.</p>
      <p>Being part of such a giant universe would normally lead to amazing roles, but Mark (the original Skywalker from the first trilogy) ended up doing voice-overs until director JJ Abrams brought him back in the rebooted movies in 2015.</p>

      <p>Although Daisy has been leading a clean lifestyle, it hasn’t come without backlash.</p>
      <p>The star was recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/07/star-wars-daisy-ridley-insists-hasnt-enjoyed-privilege-co-star-john-boyega-despite-attending-boarding-school-11406777/">criticised for insisting she isn’t more privileged than co-star John Boyega</a>.</p>
      <p>The British actress was asked if her privileged upbringing – which included a boarding school education – played a part in her confidence as an actress and her ability to navigate her high level of celebrity.</p>
      <p>But Daisy was seemingly thrown by the question in her Guardian chat and instantly refuted the interviewer’s claim that wealth, class and education allowed her to decode the rules in certain spaces.</p>
      <p>‘Well no, because, no…’, Daisy replied. ‘John grew up on a council estate in Peckham and I think me and him are similar enough that… no.’</p>
