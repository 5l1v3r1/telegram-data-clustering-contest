      <h1>'Did they not watch Arsenal?' - Fans can't believe Everton have 'made contact' with Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Reports state that Everton have made contact with former Arsenal manager Unai Emery about potentially taking over at Goodison Park, and fans of both sides cannot believe it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:30:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>Just 10 days after being dismissed as Arsenal manager, Unai Emery is already being linked with a new job in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Following Marco Silva's sacking by Everton, Sky Sports report that the former Gunners boss has been approached by the Merseyside team about potentially taking over the role.</p>
      <p>First team coach and former Everton star Duncan Ferguson was placed in temporary charge of the Toffees last week after Silva was removed from his post.</p>
      <p>And the 47-year-old oversaw a 3-1 win over Arsenal's London rivals Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday afternoon, sparking scenes of joy on the touchline.</p>
      <p>However, the club are actively searching for a new manager to take on the role permanently, and they have apparently made contact with Emery about moving to the North West.</p>
      <p>Everton fans did not seem keen on the news following his spell at the Emirates Stadium, while Arsenal fans were quick to think of a couple of former stars who have already made the move north.</p>
