      <p>Peter Dada, Akure</p>
      <p>An Ondo State Magistrates’ Court, sitting in Akure, the state capital, on Monday ordered for the remand of a police officer, Idowu Omosuyi, who allegedly killed a truck driver in Uso town, Owo Local Government Area of the state.</p>
      <p>The alleged killer cop, attached to the Federal Highway Patrol, allegedly shot the driver, Ado Saleh, at a police checkpoint on Akure-Owo Expressway at Uso last week Monday.</p>
      <p>The defendant was alleged to have shot the deceased in the head following an argument that ensued between them.</p>
      <p>The incident sparked a protest by other truck drivers and residents of the town, as they barricaded the expressway, demanding that the alleged killer policeman must be brought to book.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Omosuyi was brought before the magistrate court and was arraigned on one count of murder.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution, the offence committed was contrary to section 316 and punishable under section 319 on the criminal laws of the Ondo State.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor, Inspector Goodluck Uloh, told the court that he had a motion on notice for the remand of the defendant in prison (Correctional Service Center).</p>
      <p>The counsel for the defendant, Mr Ikujuni Ademola, however, opposed the prosecutor’s application and prayed the court to order that the defendant be returned to the police custody.</p>
      <p>Giving the ruling, the magistrate, Mrs Charity Adeyanju, ordered that the defendant should be remanded in Olokuta Prison and adjourned the matter till December 27, 2019, for a hearing of the motion.</p>
