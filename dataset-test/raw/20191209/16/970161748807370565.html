      <h1>Liz Hurley gets ready for the holidays by wrapping up as a Christmas present</h1>

        <b>Liz Hurley transformed herself into a racy present just in time for the Christmas holidays.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The star shared a raunchy snap of herself basically wrapped as an almost-nude present to her 1.4 million followers.</p>
      <p>She captioned her post: ‘I wear lots of red but Chinese red, aka Valentino red, is by far and away my favourite shade. And perfect for Xmas.’</p>
      <p>That’s a lot of names for the same shade of red.</p>
      <p>Covered in only a red satin piece of fabric while sitting on her living room floor, it’s safe to say her heating bills are through the roof.</p>
      <p>However, Liz is no stranger to posting semi-nude but classy photos on the internet.</p>

      <p>Her fans clearly appreciated the post, with one writing: ‘So beautiful,’ along with a love heart.</p>
      <p>The star goes all out for holidays, as Halloween had the 54-year-old dressed up in her best Kill Bill costume and gave Uma Thurman a run for her money.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/08/liz-hurley-blesses-us-skincare-secret-strips-off-topless-swimming-session-10539107/">Liz blessed us with her skin routine</a> while out in the sun.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the actress sent fans into meltdown with the racy upload, showing her stripping off while enjoying a quick dip.</p>
      <p>As. You. Do.</p>

      <p>‘LA morning wake up (PS I only go in the sun before 9am and after 6pm- otherwise, it’s under a large umbrella),’ she captioned the shot. And, right on cue, they were quick to flood her post with all the praise.</p>
      <p>‘This surely is “How it should be done!!!!!”,’ a fan posted. ‘Absolutely stunning, seriously fabulous, amazingly beautiful.’</p>
      <p>‘Love this photo,’ an Instagram user said. ‘That’s why your skin looks so good!!</p>
      <p>The next holiday is Valentine’s Day, so everyone needs to get ready for a saucy themed photo, one where she poses covered in roses or standing next to endless love hearts, perhaps?</p>
