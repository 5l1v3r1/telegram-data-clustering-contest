      <p>The ex-Mamelodi Sundowns man was in attendance at the Teqball World Championships, and took to Instagram to reveal his whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Teqball is a sport played between two players, or teams of three or four, which is played on a curved table. In fact, many football teams around Europe enjoy a game of Teqball in their respective dressing rooms after training sessions.</p>
      <p>That being said, Barcelona legends Carles Puyol and Ronaldinho were also in attendance, and were later seen hanging out with the former Bafana Bafana star.</p>
