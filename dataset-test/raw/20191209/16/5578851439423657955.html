        <b>President Ashraf Ghani on Monday addressed the eighth ministerial conference of the “Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process” in Turkey and emphasized the need for a political solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and stressed the need for an international and regional consensus for peace.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He said the main goal is to put an end to 40 years of violence by ensuring that not only the conflict ends but to secure guarantees for its non-repetition.</p>
      <p>“A political solution through an enduring peace process is an imperative but so is agreed-upon mechanisms for dealing with the threats of terrorism and criminality and narcotics,” Ghani said.</p>
      <p>He made some suggestions for the Afghan peace process:</p>
      <p>First, building a consensus on drivers of conflict.</p>
      <p>Second, reaching an agreement on a coordinated process of regional and international support for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.</p>
      <p>And third, design and implement a reinforcing series of dialogues between the Afghan government and people and the regional and international community with the Taliban.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the election, President Ghani said there is agreement that the Afghan security forces made it possible to hold both the parliamentary election in 2018 and the presidential election in 2019.</p>
      <p>“Their professionalism, neutrality and sacrifice have earned them the title of the guardians of the constitution and citizens’ rights,” he said.</p>
