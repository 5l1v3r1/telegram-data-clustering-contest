      <h1>Video: Fan’s Reaction To LeBron Cursing Is Going Viral</h1>

      <p>Athletes cursing during a game is nothing new. It might actually be harder to find an athlete who doesn’t swear out loud during any given game.</p>
      <p>But one fan seemed especially peeved to see Los Angeles Lakers megastar LeBron James cursing.</p>
      <p>During yesterday’s game between the Lakers and the Minnesota Timberwolves, LeBron was seen cursing along the sideline. As the camera panned across with him, a fan wearing a red shirt could be seen mouthing the words “Watch your mouth.”</p>
      <p>The video has quickly gone viral with thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets in the minutes since it was released.</p>

      <p>The Lakers and the T-Wolves played a close game through the first three quarters, but LeBron and Anthony Davis ultimately ran away with it in the fourth.</p>
      <p>LeBron finished with 32 points and a game-leading 13 assists, while Davis added 50 points and went 10-of-10 from the line.</p>
      <p>Hopefully that fan was a Lakers fan, otherwise having to watch LeBron drop those numbers on the T-Wolves might have been more upsetting than seeing him curse out loud.</p>
