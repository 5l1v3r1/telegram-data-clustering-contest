      <h1>Fraser Forster's Celtic future up in the air as Neil Lennon weighs up permanent deal</h1>
      <h2>The goalkeeper is on loan from Southampton and played a starring role in yesterday's Betfred Cup win.</h2>

      <p>Celtic manager Neil Lennon has admitted he has no idea if <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fraser-forster">Fraser Forster</a> will be with the club beyond the end of this season.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper re-joined the Hoops in the summer, signing a season-long deal as he returned from Southampton.</p>
      <p>After a man-of-the-match display against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> in the Betfred Cup Final fans are desperate for a permanent deal, but it seems things are a long way from being decided.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> said: "He's one of the best goalkeepers around.</p>
      <p>"But he's not our player and then there's affordability. We need to sit down with him and see what he wants to do. His performance came as no surprise to me because I've seen him do it many times before.</p>
      <p>"You can see how happy he is to be here and I think he's gone on record saying he loves it here so we'll see."</p>
      <p>Lennon had never previously won the League Cup as a manager, losing to Rangers in 2011 and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> the following year.</p>

      <p>"Psychologically, it's a massive win for us, massive," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's a big monkey off my back. It's been annoying me and eating away at me for a while. I've got all the trophies now as a manager and as a player. It was a very proud moment."</p>
