      <h1>Christine McGuinness puts up first Christmas tree in years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:26:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Isobel Lewis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christine-mcguinness/">Christine McGuinness</a> was the ‘proudest mummy’ after managing to put up her first Christmas tree in years around her young children.</p>
      <p>As a mother of three kids, two of whom are on the autistic spectrum, Christmas can be a tough time for Christine and her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/paddy-mcguinness/">husband Paddy</a>, with their children often getting overwhelmed and anxious by the change in routine and excitement that comes with the festive season.</p>
      <p>However, the 31-year-old model took to Instagram on Monday to share the exciting news that the family had been able to put up their first Christmas tree in years and we’re so pleased for them.</p>
      <p>‘Christmas is always a very difficult time of year for us,’ the proud Christine wrote.</p>
      <p>‘Our children can get overwhelmed, upset with all the changes everywhere, the lack of school routine, they get overstimulated and anxious meaning daily meltdowns are a given.</p>
      <p>‘This year I am preparing more than ever, visiting Christmas displays as much as possible (even if we only last 5 minutes)… even watching peppa pigs Christmas on repeat [sic].’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘So far they are coping amazing and we have managed to put a tree up at home without any upset for the first time in years! Now, somehow I just need to keep this whole calm, prep, structured Christmas feel around for the next 2 weeks!’</p>

      <p>A vocal advocate for autism awareness, Christine and her family hit the headlines last month after Take Me Out presenter Paddy was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/paddy-mcguiness-hits-back-as-man-claims-his-family-dont-look-disabled-after-parking-in-disabled-bay-11036964/">forced to defend himself</a> from a man who said his kids ‘don’t look disabled’ while using a blue badge parking bay.</p>
      <p>Appearing on BBC Breakfast, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/christine-mcguinness-not-proud-blue-badge-criticised-parking-disabled-spot-11039819/">Christine explained</a>: ‘[Having the blue badge] has changed our lives.</p>
      <p>‘Autism really affects [the children’s] anxiety, they’ve also got absolutely no sense of danger, so they wouldn’t think twice about walking out into a busy car park or busy road.’</p>
      <p>With Paddy often off working, Christine admitted that she normally went out with the kids on her own, making the ability to take them out without judgment even more necessary.</p>
      <p>‘It allows me to be able to go out with my children on my own and that’s what I want to do, I want to be like any other mum,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘I would never use those spaces without the children. I don’t want to use this space, I’m not proud of having a blue badge. I have it because my children need it for their safety, that’s why we have it.’</p>
