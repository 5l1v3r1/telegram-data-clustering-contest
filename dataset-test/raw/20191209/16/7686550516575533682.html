      <p>A mum has shared her horror of waking up to find that someone had smashed her car to pieces in an apparent fit of rage.</p>
      <p>Alison Brown was fast asleep at her home in Porthcawl on December 2 when she suddenly had a knock at her front door in the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>Standing outside was the police, who had been called by a member of the public after receiving reports of someone going beserk on a white Suzuki Swift.</p>
      <p>Alison said: "When I went outside I could see that the car was destroyed. The damage is horrendous.</p>
      <p>"The amount of anger used on the car is really scary and it is still scary thinking about it now.</p>
      <p>"It looks like someone has crashed into the car. I just want this person to be found before he does it on someone else's car or even worse does it to someone."</p>

      <p>Alison added that the damage to her car was made all the worse as she had only bought it in July.</p>
      <p>The motor has since been taken to a garage, with the 52-year-old set to lose her no claims discount on her insurance.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's my excess that I will have to pay and it's my insurance policy that will now go up because of this.</p>
      <p>"This will affect me financially in years to come. I am still scared and I am just finding it hard really."</p>
      <p>A post on social media from Alison's daughter Rebecca is urging people to get in touch if anyone has any information.</p>
      <p>"You can see where they’ve held the top of the car to boot the s**t out of it. Its un-drivable and the doors are so damaged they won’t open. Its the only car that has been targeted.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who might have any information or CCTV we can view please get in touch," she said.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed it was investigating the incident - which took place on South Road, Porthcawl, between 1.30am and 1.40am on Monday 2nd December.</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information is asked to call South Wales Police on 101 and quote reference 1900443508.</p>
