      <p>Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige promises the Multiverse will be key to the next phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and television shows.</p>
      <p>Feige told fans at Comic Con Experience in Brazil that "The multiverse is the next step in the evolution of the MCU, and <a href="https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-2-baron-mordo-villain-role/"><i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i></a> is gonna crack it wide open in ways that will have repercussions for a Disney+ series just before it, that’s not <i>WandaVision</i>, and for movies just after it in a big, fun way."</p>

      <p>As far as Disney+ is concerned, it's interesting to note Feige says the Multiverse won't just be integral to the upcoming <i>WandaVision</i> series. The MCU overseer has already warned viewers they'll need to watch the Disney+ shows to keep up with what's going on in the rest of the franchise. Additionally, considering the movie's name, it's no surprise that Feige highlights <i>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</i> as a turning point for the Multiverse.</p>

      <p>While we still have a ways to go before we learn more about the Multiverse, there's plenty to keep fans occupied in the meantime, such as Marvel Studios' next project, <i>Black Widow</i>. Directed by Cate Shortland, <i>Black Widow</i> stars Scarlett Johansson as Natasha, Florence Pugh stars as Yelena, David Harbour as Alexei aka The Red Guardian and Rachel Weisz as Melina. The film opens May 1, 2020.</p>
