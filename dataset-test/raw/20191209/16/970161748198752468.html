      <h1>What to do if your lover says something awkward during sex</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:11:58+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Almara Abgarian</a></address>
      <p>A decade ago, I was in bed with a man when he suddenly shouted ‘I love you, baby’ – which wouldn’t have been a problem, had this not been the first time we’d had sex.</p>
      <p>The only thing I could think of to do was to keep calm and carry on, and act like I hadn’t heard him (trust me, even the neighbours heard him).</p>
      <p>In all likelihood, this man wasn’t in love with me, but was probably experiencing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/04/what-is-sex-brain-10860079/">‘sex brain’</a> – when feel-good hormones are released in the brain, which can make you say or do things you otherwise wouldn’t.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/18/talk-dirty-to-me-what-men-and-women-like-to-hear-in-bed-7306215/">Dirty (or romantic) talk in the bedroom is very common</a>; according to a study by Saucy Dates, released in 2018, 76% of men and 74% of women like chatting between the sheets – with ‘baby’, ‘daddy’ and ‘harder’ topping the list as the favourite words to hear.</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that there are different levels of dirty talk.</p>
      <p>Some phrases are just a slip of the tongue (f***, God, oh yeah), but others can form part of a wider fetish or specific role play scenarios.</p>
      <p>Then there are those other instances, where someone just says something incredibly awkward that ruins the moment – which is exactly what happened to Emelie*, 24.</p>
      <p>‘Three years ago, I slept with a guy who told me, and I quote, he “likes when he hits the cervix” because he’s doing “the best possible job”,’ she tells us.</p>
      <p>‘I was like “errrrr right, just don’t slam it in there, it’s not a goal”.</p>
      <p>‘Also, who the f*** uses cervix as sexy talk? That is a word strictly to be used with a gynecologist, not a partner.’</p>
      <p>Farren, 22, reveals that a man once made her feel uncomfortable while having sex with her, because he commented on her height – which is an issue she’s already self-conscious about.</p>
      <p>‘I once slept with this guy who was shorter than me, and let’s just say it wasn’t the smoothest sex I’ve had,’ Farren*, 22, tells Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>‘Being quite self-conscious about my height I was already nervous of sleeping with Ellis, who was only two inches shorter than me.</p>
      <p>‘Things were going well until we got to my favourite position, doggy. Things were all heated up and suddenly I hear “can you go down a bit, I’m not tall enough”.</p>
      <p>‘So shamelessly I went into an awkward crooked plank position and now I’m very picky when it comes to how tall men are. I guess every inch really does count.’</p>
      <p>If your sexual partner utters a phrase that makes you cringe or feel uncomfortable, you are completely within your right to raise it with them.</p>
      <p>Don’t go along with it just to please them, if it makes you uneasy – what happens in the bedroom should always be consensual, and that includes words.</p>
      <p>So, what is the best way to raise the issue with someone?</p>
      <p>Nadia from <a href="https://www.theintimologyinstitute.com/who-we-are">The Intimology Institute</a>, an organisation that specialises in sexual wellness and how to understand pleasure, explains that how it should be handled depends on the situation.</p>
      <p>She says: ‘I don’t know about you but I get totally creeped out by super lovey-dovey names such as darling or honey (I know I have issues), and even more so by the insistence of me calling him daddy (err, it’s a no from me).</p>
      <p>‘In this situation, I try not to let it ruin my fun by centering my thoughts to how I’m physically feeling in the moment. Alternatively kissing is a really good tactic, after all, you can’t talk and kiss at the same time (thank me later).</p>
      <p>‘However, if the language takes a more derogatory turn which makes you feel more uncomfortable, it’s best to stop what whatever you’re doing and unpack what was said.</p>
      <p>‘Stronger words may often be triggering and can dredge up unwanted feelings.</p>
      <p>‘Ultimately communication is important within any type of relationship, so it’s advisable to have a conversation about it after the event.’</p>

      <p>You can absolutely keep going and subtly make it clear to your partner that they went too far – but remember that you can also stop the sex at any point.</p>
      <p>Jack*, tells us that he once had a one-night-stand with a woman and felt so uncomfortable by what she said during the act, that he didn’t want to – and couldn’t – continue.</p>
      <p>‘She wanted to be choked, which wasn’t really my bag but I went with it,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘Then she started shouting “harder, harder” and after five minutes of that she screamed “punish me, punish me with your hard c***”.</p>
      <p>‘That was the end for me, we did not carry on.</p>
      <p>‘I said something like, that’s enough for me, in a sarcastic tone. It was a massive turn-off.’</p>
      <p>Try to remember that many times, people say things between the sheets that are reserved for the bedroom.</p>
      <p>Maybe they’re into baby talk, because it makes them feel vulnerable, or perhaps they just really like to be called ‘bitch’, ‘good boy’ or something else.</p>
      <p>There’s no right or wrong, so don’t make jokes about your partner’s preferences.</p>
      <p>Simply make it clear that this isn’t for you, and if you’re in a committed relationship, perhaps discuss alternatives that you are both comfortable with.</p>
      <p>You can even make a list of words that are acceptable during sex and ones that aren’t, so that you both know where the limits lie going forward.</p>
      <p>‘Lay it all out on the table and let your partner know why it made you uncomfortable,’ said Nadia.</p>
      <p>‘Often people say and think things during the throes of sex that is not part of their everyday thoughts/vocabulary and is not necessarily what they think or feel about you.</p>
      <p>‘Talking through your fears may actually lead you to a point where you can tentatively try dirty talk in a way that makes you feel safe and respected.’</p>
      <p>On the flipside, if there’s something you really want to say or be called in bed, speak up.</p>
      <p>Chat to your sexual partner and explain that it turns you on, and see if they’d be willing to do it.</p>
      <p>You won’t know until you ask, and it’s better to have the conversation first.</p>
