      <p>Strangeways is on the historic estate of GoldenEye, a parcel of 15 acres of land Fleming bought in 1946 on the island's north shore.</p>
      <p>The legendary British author used it as an idyllic writing base, swimming in the ocean and sunbathing in the garden before picking up his pen.</p>

      <p>Fleming named the estate 'GoldenEye' after Operation Goldeneye - an Allied plan during World War Two to monitor Spain after a possible alliance between Franco and the Axis powers - which he formed in his role as part of the Naval Intelligence Division.</p>
      <p>However, the 1995 film GoldenEye, the first to star Pierce Brosnan as Bond, was not based on any elements from Fleming's works.</p>
      <p>The story - where Bond fights to prevent a rogue ex-MI6 agent from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown - was written by Michael France.</p>
      <p>Fleming's visitors at GoldenEye, on Oracabessa Bay, included actors, musicians and filmmakers.</p>
      <p>His three-bedroom home on the estate, which overlooked a private beach, is now part of the GoldenEye Hotel and Resort.</p>
