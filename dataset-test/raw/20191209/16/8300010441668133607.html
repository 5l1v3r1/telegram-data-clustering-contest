      <p>According to her biography on the <a href="https://www.missuniverse.com/contestant/1000734#contestant.news">pageant website</a>, Tunzi hails from Tsolo, South Africa. and is "a passionate activist and engaged in the fight against gender based violence."<br/><br/>She also devoted her social media campaign to "changing the narrative around gender stereotypes" and worked to promote natural beauty as well as women loving themselves.<br/><br/>"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me with my kind of skin and my kind of hair was never considered to be beautiful," she said during the contest. "And I think it's time that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face and see theirs reflected in mine."<br/><br/>When asked during Sunday's contest what it is most important to teach young girls today, Tunzi said leadership, unleashing a standing ovation.<br/><br/>She said she grew up in a world where women who looked like her were not seen as beautiful. It is time for this to end, she said.<br/><br/>After the show, Tunzi echoed that statement on Twitter saying, "Tonight a door was opened and I could not be more grateful to have been the one to have walked through it."</p>
