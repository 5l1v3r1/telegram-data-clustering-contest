      <h1>Xiaomi Redmi K30 specs revealed – could it be the next OnePlus killer?</h1>

        <b>Xiaomi has teased several enticing new details about its next handset, the Redmi K30. Will it offer premium features on a reasonable budget?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A series of posts on Chinese social network Weibo have revealed what we can expect to see from the Redmi K30, the sequel to the Redmi K20 (known as the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-9t-pro">Xiaomi Mi 9T</a> in the UK), which was branded the “Flagship Killer 2.0” at launch as a clear dig aimed at the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-7">OnePlus 7</a>. With impressive specs such as 5G connectivity and a 64-megapixel camera, can the K30 also aspire to knock flagship phones off their perch?</p>

      </p>
      <p>The K30 will be Redmi’s first-ever 5G phone, although a 4G variant of the device will also be available. The battery will have a 4500mAh capacity with an impressive 30W fast-charging capability. For greater flexibility, the device offers both NFC (enabling actions such as contactless payments), and a 3.5mm headphone jack that means you won’t have to rely on pricey bluetooth headphones.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The camera also looks to be an impressive set up, with the main Sony IMX 686 sensor having a resolution of 64-megapixels. The released image of the rear of the handset (at the top of the page) shows a total of four rear camera lenses, and a dual selfie camera present as a cutout in the screen, similar to the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/galaxy-s10-plus">Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus</a>.</p>

      <p>We’ve got high expectations of this upcoming smartphone, since we were so impressed with the performance of the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-9t-pro">Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro</a>. The snappy performance, great camera, and attractive design helped this high-performing device on its way to an enviable 4.5/5 star rating — but there was still room for improvement, as it lacks some higher-end features such as wireless charging and waterproofing, while the software interface remains imperfect.</p>
