        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Growing up on a farm in the Blue Ridge Mountains, our Christmas tree came straight from our woods, or if there wasn’t a good candidate that year, we bought from a Christmas tree farm.</p>
      <p>That magical experience waned when I moved farther south where the weather could be 80 degrees as I picked out a semi-live tree from a lot and tried to secure it to the top of a compact car. The final death knell rang the year I could not get the tree into the stand and ended up trying to whittle the trunk with a screwdriver and a hammer. It was time to move to an artificial tree I could manage.</p>
      <p>My first artificial tree rang true to its name. It looked fake from even 3 miles away. Fortunately, tree designers and manufacturers have gotten better at producing more realistic branches and needles. I’ve gotten savvier at selecting trees and have settled on the proper height and circumference for my living space.</p>
      <p>After a few years of attempting to wrangle lights onto my artificial tree, I opted for a pre-lit tree. With the selections offered today, you can have lights of any color, special effects ranging from flashing to dimming to changing colors. It is important to look for a pre-lit tree that is labeled “with burn-out protection” or “continuous on.” This means that if one bulb goes out, the rest of the strand will stay lit.</p>
      <p>After going through a series of trees, I’ve gained a bit of knowledge that allows me to help others make a good decision when buying a pre-lit artificial tree:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure the space where you plan to put the tree so you can purchase the height and diameter that works for you. Since artificial trees are so lightweight, you may be able to lift a shorter tree by placing it on a sturdy base (more room for gifts under the tree!).</li>
        <li>Look for trees with branches and needles that are molded as one, not attached by wires, to more closely resemble a real tree.</li>
        <li>Choose a tree with the highest tip count you can afford. More tips make an artificial tree look fuller and provide more spots to place <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-ornaments">ornaments</a>.</li>
        <li>A higher light count means a brighter tree. A good rule is 100 light bulbs per every 1.5 feet of the tree.</li>
        <li>Most artificial trees have a life expectancy of around 10 years. Invest in a tree bag to help protect the tree from dust and insects while it’s in storage.</li>
        <li>If you crave the scent of a real tree, skip the artificial sprays and buy a fresh pine wreath or garland to bring the outdoors into your home.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have seen and researched many pre-lit artificial trees over the years. I’m always looking for the most beautiful, easiest to assemble, and the best value in products for myself and others.</p>

      <h4>The best pre-lit Christmas tree overall</h4>
      <h4>The lush and full 7-foot <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Q85K4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_101719_best-pre-lit-artificial-christmas-trees-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B073Q85K4Q&amp;amp;linkId=7f6fda43657fb44c74f7c4d3a02e394e">Balsam Hill Classic Blue Spruce</a> features 850 LED clear lights and 2,366 branch tips with realistic needles.</h4>
      <p>Even if you’ve never been to Colorado, you’ll love their state tree, the blue spruce, with its blue-green, light grey, and moss green needles. Balsam Hill captured the majesty in their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Q85K4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_101719_best-pre-lit-artificial-christmas-trees-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B073Q85K4Q&amp;amp;linkId=7f6fda43657fb44c74f7c4d3a02e394e">Classic Blue Spruce Pre-lit LED Artificial Christmas Tree</a>. The 7-foot height (without a tree topper) and 53-inch width are perfect for a statement tree in your home.</p>
      <p>Balsam Hill trees are exceptionally realistic because they have so many branch tips that can be fluffed and spread to create fullness. The PVC needles are soft, pliable, and flat just like real spruce needles. The sturdy branches are hinged for quick and easy setup.</p>
      <p>My favorite feature is the lights. While many LED clear lights are dazzlingly bright, Balsam Hill uses Candlelight LED bulbs that cast a soft glow more like an incandescent bulb. There are 850 hand-strung lights attached to the branches. The tree comes with extra bulbs and fuses, and the lights are designed to be continuously on if one bulb on a strand goes out.</p>
      <p>The tree comes with a tree stand with rubber, scratch-proof feet, storage bags, and my favorite, an on/off foot pedal so you don’t have to crawl under the tree every night to unplug it.</p>
      <p>With the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, more than 700 reviews on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Q85K4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_101719_best-pre-lit-artificial-christmas-trees-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B073Q85K4Q&amp;amp;linkId=7f6fda43657fb44c74f7c4d3a02e394e">Amazon</a>, and a 4.5-star overall rating, clearly, this tree is more than worthy of our top pick.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Easy assembly, 2,366 branch tips, 850 LED lights, realistic color and needles, 3-year limited warranty</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Time must be spent to spread and fluff the branches to achieve fullness</p>

      <p>There are spaces like entryways, tight corners, and small apartments where a wide Christmas tree just won’t work. Most artificial trees come in full, slim, or pencil widths. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M7M6KL3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_101719_best-pre-lit-artificial-christmas-trees-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M7M6KL3&amp;amp;linkId=64fe7b0d4bb05b69128a44ff7433fe53">Puleo International Slim Fraser Fir Pre-Lit Artificial Tree</a> stands at 7.5 feet tall and gives the illusion of a wide, full tree but in a slender 42-inch diameter.</p>
      <p>When a friend moved from a large home into a patio home, her previous tree just wouldn’t work in the living room unless everyone wanted to stand around the tree for the entire season because there was no room for chairs. So we went shopping for a more slender tree. Pencil trees just didn’t offer enough branches to accommodate her favorite ornaments, but this slim <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M7M6KL3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_101719_best-pre-lit-artificial-christmas-trees-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M7M6KL3&amp;amp;linkId=64fe7b0d4bb05b69128a44ff7433fe53">Puleo International Fraser Fir Artificial Tree</a> was perfect.</p>
      <p>The 7.5-foot tree is pre-strung with 500 lights and has 1,453 branch tips to create the illusion of a wider, full tree. The tree is simple to assemble with just three sections to put together. The included tree stand is sturdy and the lights are soft white, UL-listed. The lights are “continuous on” so that if one bulb goes out, the others stay on.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> 500 lights, 1,453 branch tips, 5-year warranty for tree, 2-year warranty for lights</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Lights are not LED, no storage bag included</p>

      <p>This charming tree looks like you just brought it in from the snowy woods. But the benefit of a flocked artificial tree dusted with snow is that it won’t melt and leave puddles on your floor. When I was growing up, we added a wintry-touch to live trees with a can of spray-on snow. I can tell you it was quite messy, and cleaning the floor was not simple. So when I discovered this <a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/c/196318/456723/8154?subId1=biipgf_101719_best-pre-lit-artificial-christmas-trees&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FHome-Accents-Holiday-7-5-ft-Pre-Lit-LED-Flocked-Pine-Artificial-Christmas-Tree-with-500-Warm-White-Lights-TG76M3C03L05%2F305123758">Lexington Pine snow-flocked pre-lit tree</a>, I love that I could have the look without the extra effort and mess.</p>
      <p>Standing 7.5 feet tall, this pine is pre-strung with 500 LED lights in a warm white. The 1,254 branch tips are accented with flocked pine cones to add to the natural, woodsy look. There’s still plenty of room for your ornaments and maybe a red bird or two peeping out of the branches. The medium width of 48 inches is perfect for most spaces</p>
      <p>The tree sets up quickly because the plugs for each section of lighted branches are located inside the tree pole, or trunk. As you add each section, the lights illuminate automatically as you connect the plugs. The tree features an on/off foot pedal for convenience, and extra lights and fuses are included.</p>
      <p>With nearly 250 reviews on <a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/c/196318/456723/8154?subId1=biipgf_101719_best-pre-lit-artificial-christmas-trees&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FHome-Accents-Holiday-7-5-ft-Pre-Lit-LED-Flocked-Pine-Artificial-Christmas-Tree-with-500-Warm-White-Lights-TG76M3C03L05%2F305123758">The Home Depot</a>, the tree has a rating of 4.6 stars. Many reviewers said they loved the natural look so much that they didn’t even add decorations.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> 7.5 feet tall, 1,254 branch tips, 500 LED pre-strung lights, sprinkled with pine cones, foot pedal for light control</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Flocking can shed during setup</p>

      <p>The first silver tree I ever saw was in my aunt’s living room. It was almost like a needleless tree with silver pom-poms at the end of every branch. I was mesmerized with its ever-changing colors as the separate rotating light wheel turned it from red to blue to silver. It was like celebrating Christmas with the Jetsons.</p>

Just like its green counterparts, a tinsel tree is made from PVC plastic that has been coated to give the needles their shimmer. And with 210 pre-strung incandescent clear lights, this one is a showstopper.</p>
      <p>The tree is 6 feet tall with a slender 27-inch diameter and weighs just 10 pounds making it simple to assemble. The tree comes with a four-point tree stand and has pull down branches. There are 520 branch tips to fluff out and hold all of your favorite ornaments.</p>
      <p>If you want a fashion-forward holiday, use only one color of ornaments for a stylized effect. Or silver trees are great for highlighting antique ornaments, especially fragile mercury glass pieces. Either way, you’ll be smiling each time you use the foot control to turn on and off the lights.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> 6-foot slender silhouette, 210 pre-strung lights, 520 branch tips, tree stand included</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> No storage bag is included</p>

The branches are spruce-like and fluff out easily. This is a good looking tree at a bargain price.</p>
