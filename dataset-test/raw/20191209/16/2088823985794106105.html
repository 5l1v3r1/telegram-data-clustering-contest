      <h1>This Week in Buffalo: Scrooge, Wet Bandits and Christmas jazz</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:47:28+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/ben.tsujimoto</a></address>
      <p>There are parts of the holiday season we cannot go without each year. Maybe it's specific music, the ceremonial lighting of a tree, dressing up for a holiday event or baking reindeer-shaped snicker doodle cookies.</p>
      <p>Don't have one that comes to mind? Consider long-standing traditions – such as "A Christmas Carol" by Alleyway Theatre, now in its 37th year – and developing traditions such as JazzBuffalo's holiday show, which has the promise to carry on for decades.</p>
      <p>Watching "Home Alone" every December is another holiday must for many. Why not do it with Buffalo's elite classical musicians delivering a powerful, live soundtrack? Here's your guide for this week.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/517008879141684/">A Jazzy Christmas</a></b>, 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 11, at Hotel Henry (corner of Rockwell and Cleveland). Tickets are <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-jazzy-christmas-with-the-buffalo-dolls-and-the-ladies-first-jazz-big-band-tickets-76587432071?aff=efbeventtix&amp;fbclid=IwAR0Z7HW750OIHX7pB7ISF-BvzAFvEHs_4oPIUCRjDj2IxmwWsz5iATdrOwM">$15 in advance</a>.</p>
      <p>Last year's JazzBuffalo Jazzy Christmas was so popular it sold out twice – the people kept demanding more! – and now it's back by popular demand.</p>

      <p>The performers – the Ladies First Jazz Big Band and the Buffalo Dolls – both return with their early 20th century twists on holiday classics.</p>

Tickets are $40 for adults, $20 for students; <a href="https://tickets.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&amp;w=98294bb620eaffe565aa42fe80692114&amp;vqitq=d6263bf7-586d-452d-9ec0-b7f4ff4d7b00&amp;vqitp=b589ef09-9398-4cbe-89b5-a9990c9fb0b4&amp;vqitts=1575903783&amp;vqitc=vendini&amp;vqite=itl&amp;vqitrt=Safetynet&amp;vqith=653713e446bda46d576b8a7a51f910ab">full details</a>. Production runs through Dec. 22 (although the finale already has sold out).</p>
      <p>When Colin Dabkowski <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2017/12/11/35-years-on-alleyway-theatres-christmas-carol-is-going-strong/">detailed the 35th anniversary</a> of Neal Radice's holiday production two years ago, he called it a "comforting constant in a changing city." That still rings true, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/12/08/new-home-values-show-widening-gap-between-buffalos-neighborhoods/">urban renaissance or not</a>.</p>
      <p>Scrooge, who's probably not thrilled with repeating his character transformation every holiday season the last 175 years, is ultimately an encouraging reminder that people can change. (The play is also encouraging for medium-sized and large people named Tim).</p>

      <p><b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/496982804383656/">"Home Alone" with the BPO,</a></b> 7 to 10 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 11, at Kleinhans Music Hall (3 Symphony Circle). Tickets <a href="https://bpo.secure.force.com/ticket/?fbclid=IwAR3fX0vnSzDE19ZHp5NJv9lPrVrEALkT1rwEorOgkTyCdK4B56yJXuyj9p0#/instances/a0F2I00000SuNObUAN/sectionGroups/a0b2I00000IPjQzQAL">begin at $29</a>.</p>
      <p>Macaulay Culkin is obviously the star of "Home Alone," with the antics of the Wet Bandits coming a close second. ("You look like a chicken"). But the most unheralded standout of "Home Alone"? It's John Williams, who wrote a brilliant soundtrack that will be amplified – live to film – by the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra this week at Kleinhans.</p>
      <p>The spectacle is an excellent way to cherish the gifts of the BPO while checking off a holiday tradition.</p>

      <p><b><a href="https://www.sheas.org/performances/les-miserables/">"Les Miserables,"</a></b> begins at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 10, at Shea's Buffalo Theatre (646 Main St.). <a href="https://www.sheas.org/performances/les-miserables/">Tickets start at $37</a>. Production runs through Dec. 15.</p>
      <p>What would Christmas be without Jean Valjean? (Answer: Probably still the same Christmas). But the Broadway production of "Les Mis," a scalding hot ticket back in 2012 for its 25th anniversary, nabbed a <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2012/02/29/a-retooled-les-mis-for-its-25th-year/">3.5-star review</a> from Ben Siegel and now returns to the Theatre District.</p>
      <p>Like many big-budget touring musicals, "Les Miserables" is pleasing to the eyes and ears, with upgraded cinematic elements and a timeless score.</p>

      <p>More than 30 vendors will take part in the Kenmore Business Association's holiday extravaganza, jammed with perks like wine and food samples, free parking at meters with Christmas tree labels, a Chinese auction and a checklist with potential prizes.</p>
      <p>The event headquarters (also site of the snacks) is <a href="https://diversifiedhearing.com/">Diversified Hearing</a>, at 2900 Delaware Ave., with the participants listed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kenmorebusinessassociation/photos/pcb.463231900997696/10156529392407161/?type=3&amp;theater">here</a>.
