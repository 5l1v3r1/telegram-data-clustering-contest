      <p>The Svartpilen 200 is based on the KTM 200 Duke and gets the same 26hp, 200cc, single-cylinder engine.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/husqvarna-svartpilen-250-vitpilen-250-revealed-at-india-bike-week-2019-415127">Husqvarna has just entered the Indian market with the Svartpilen 250 and the Vitpilen 250</a></b>. These two KTM 250 Duke-based models are set to be the company’s first offerings in India once they hit the market in February 2020. However, it looks like Husqvarna won’t be stopping there as their global website was recently updated with a new model – the Svartpilen 200.</p>
      <p>Like the 250s, the Svartpilen 200 is based on a KTM as well. It uses the same 200cc, single-cylinder, fuel-injected liquid-cooled motor that makes 26hp. Mated to this DOHC engine is a 6-speed gearbox. Other mechanicals like the suspension and brakes remain similar too. Moreover, the Svartpilen 200 also uses the same alloy wheels as the Svartpilen 250 and not wire-spoke wheels like the 401. Other components like the body panels and LED lighting are identical to that of the Svartpilen 250. However, the 200 runs an underslung exhaust and not the side-mounted one like the 250.</p>
      <p>Husqvarna could launch the Svartpilen 200 in India sometime next year as a more affordable version of the 250. We have seen KTM do this with the 200 Duke and 250 Duke. What remains to be seen is how they will be priced. We can expect the Husqvarna Svartpilen 200 to cost around Rs 10,000-15,000 more than the KTM 200 Duke, which sells for Rs 1.62 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).</p>
