      <p>A couple of days ago, Galaxy 2.0, GOG's upcoming hub type launcher, got a closed beta update and now, it has reached the open beta phase. You can see a small feature overview above.</p>
      <p>As a reminder for those who haven't followed the development too close, the folks at GOG <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/gogs-galaxy-20-launcher-aims-to-bring-games-from-all-platforms-to-one-place">announced their plans for the new launcher in May</a>, launcher which entered <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-closed-beta-for-gog-galaxy-20-is-now-live">an invite-based closed beta a month later</a>.</p>
      <p>In July, it received its first relatively major content patch, version 2.0.3 or the Nyx Update. Keeping the space theme, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/gog-galaxy-20s-atlas-update-brings-in-global-search-better-performance-and-more">September's Atlas Update (v2.0.5)</a> added a slew of features like global search, expansive customization features for your library, and much more. November saw the release of <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/gog-enhances-its-galaxy-20-closed-beta-with-the-euporie-update---heres-whats-new">the Euporie Update (v2.0.9)</a> with its support for mouse shortcuts (on Windows), duplicate game stacking, searching for community integrations, and access to GOG game extras.</p>
      <p>Finally, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/gog-galaxy-20s-argus-update-adds-sharing-of-stats-cross-platform-friend-activity">the Argus Update (v2.0.10/2.0.11)</a> that made its way to folks on December 7 added the ability to see your friends' activity across connected platforms via a new dedicated sidebar, as well as to share your stats - like number of owned games, achievements, and so on - to social media.
