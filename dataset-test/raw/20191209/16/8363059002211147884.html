      <h1>The Newest Star Wars Featurette Is About the Power of Friendship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:40:27+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Muncy</a></address>
      <p>Some heartwarming news: the <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/does-adam-driver-think-theres-still-some-ben-solo-in-ky-1840216664">cast members</a> of the <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-sentimental-reason-it-was-so-hard-to-write-the-rise-1840216994">new <i>Star Wars </i>trilogy</a> seems to really like each other. Which makes the newest <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/12/star-wars-kathleen-kennedy-on-the-long-road-to-ending-the-skywalkers-story/"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a> featurette a joy to watch.</p>
      <p>Titled “Friendship,” the new featurette, looking back at the behind-the-scenes history of the franchise, focuses on the intimacy and warmth that exists among the cast and crew of those who created these nine films. In a couple short minutes, it makes the process of creating these films seem like an authentically positive, affirming experience, one that forms lifelong friendships.</p>

      <p>It’s also one that features quite a bit of dancing. In the featurette, we see a classic clip of a young Billy Dee Williams slowly grooving, and we also see Daisy Ridley breaking it down while dressed in her Rey getup. <i>Star Wars </i>stories are often about found family and its power, and it’s nice to see that for those who create those stories, that experience might be very real indeed.</p>
      <p><i>The Rise of Skywalker </i>hits cinemas 20th December.</p>
