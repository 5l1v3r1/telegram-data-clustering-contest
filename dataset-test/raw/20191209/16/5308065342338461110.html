      <p>Singapore—A Filipino domestic helper died in a hit-and-run accident while walking in a covered walkway outside Farrer Road MRT station in Bukit Timah on Saturday, December 7.</p>
      <p>According to the Police, at 6:00 am on that day, they were alerted to a hit-and-run accident that involved a vehicle and a pedestrian in Farrer Road, heading towards Queensway.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old driver of the car that hit her reportedly lost control of the vehicle. He was arrested by the Police for causing death by dangerous driving following the incident.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/maid-dies-hit-and-run-after-car-hits-walkway-man-arrested">The New Paper (TNP)</a> </i>reports that the victim’s name is Lyn Ocampo Santos. A paramedic pronounced her dead at the scene.</p>

      <p>Ms Santos had reportedly taken a bus to Empress Road Market and Food Centre and was on foot on the covered pavement when the car collided into her, reported Chinese-language evening daily Lianhe Wanbao.</p>
      <p>Ms Santos had been walking to the market on the covered walkway when the out-of-control car hit her from behind, according to Ms Santos’ sister, who also lives and works in Singapore. She had been told this by the police after the accident.</p>
      <p>It was Ms Santos’ daily habit to buy groceries at the market. She would often meet her sister and other domestic helpers at the food centre and they would all have breakfast together.</p>
      <p>TNP reports that an owner of an Indian food stall at Empress Road Market and Food Centre said that these friends, together with Ms Santos’ sister, had waited for the victim on the morning of her accident, as they were set to have breakfast together that day.</p>
      <p>But on that fateful Saturday morning, they waited in vain.</p>
      <p>The food stall owner, who identified himself only as Mr Shahu, said,”The sister then received a call from the police and panicked when she found out about the accident.”</p>
      <p>The Filipino domestic helper had worked in Singapore for around 15 years. She has two sons living in the Philippines with her husband. The older one is 18, and Ms Santos had been intending to make a trip home in March for his graduation.</p>
      <p>Her younger son is only 7.</p>
      <p>According to Shin Min Daily, Ms Santos had been expecting that some members of her family would visit her in Singapore in 2020. One of her cousins told Shin Min Daily News that Ms Santos, the oldest among her siblings, had helped support her younger brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p>Her husband, a bank employee in the Philippines, will be coming to Singapore to claim her body and bring it home.</p>
      <p>Workers at Empress Road Market and Food Centre have many fond memories of Ms Santos, whom they descried as lively and outgoing, and expressed sorrow at her demise.</p>
      <p>According to stall owner Mr Shahu, “She was friendly and easy-going. About five or six of them would gather every morning to have breakfast after their shopping, and she would greet everyone. When we found out about the accident, we were all heartbroken.”</p>
      <p>Police are now investigating the circumstances that led to her death, and urged individuals who posses information regarding the accident to submit it online at <a href="http://www.police.gov.sg/iwitness">www.police.gov.sg/iwitness</a> or call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000. All information will be kept confidential.  -/TISG</p>
