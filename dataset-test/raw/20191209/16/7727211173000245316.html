      <p>Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland has warned Liverpool that he and his teammates will be ready and raring to go on Tuesday evening - because they have nothing to lose.</p>
      <p>A win for Salzburg on the night would guarantee a place in the last-16 for them, while the Reds need just a point to progress.</p>
      <p>Haaland became the third youngest player, behind only Raul Gonzalez and Wayne Rooney, to net a Champions League hat-trick when he scored three in Salzburg's 6-2 victory against Genk on matchday one.</p>
      <p>The Leeds-born Norway international has scored in each of Salzburg's five matches so far in this season's group stage, including netting the equalising goal at Anfield in the game that the Reds went on to win 4-3 thanks to Mohamed Salah's strike.</p>
      <p>He said: "We have nothing to lose. We will go out there and enjoy ourselves, smile, enjoy the game.</p>
      <p>"It's the biggest game of my life so far and I'm looking forward to it. I'm living the dream and its matches like this that you dream of."</p>
      <p>The forward, who has scored an astonishing 28 goals in 21 games this season, has been linked with almost every top side in Europe off the back of that incredible form, but he insists he is only focused on the job in hand.</p>
      <p>Haaland added: "I just focus on my job, playing football, enjoying what I do every day. Enjoying the moment, right now, and to focus on Salzburg."</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to the game, Salzburg boss Jesse Marsch said: "We go into the game with a relaxed mind, and will give everything that we have.</p>
      <p>"It's crazy this opportunity for us. We are ready to make something special tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp is expected to make changes to the side that beat Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon, with Gini Wijnaldum back in the squad to face the Austrians and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also hoping for another start.</p>
