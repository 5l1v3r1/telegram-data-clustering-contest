      <p>Serge Haroche, a Moroccan-born French scientist, was a co-recipient of the <b>2012 Nobel Prize in Physics</b>, along with US physicist David Wineland.</p>
      <p>The two scientists, who worked separately, paved the way for experiments in the field of quantum physics, after showing how individual quantum particles may be observed without being destroyed. </p>
      <p>They were recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for developing "ingenious laboratory methods" that allowed them to manage, measure and control fragile quantum states.</p>
      <p>"Their ground-breaking methods have enabled this field of research to take the very first steps towards building a new type of superfast computer based on quantum physics," the Academy said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The research has also led to the construction of extremely precise clocks that could become the future basis for a new standard of time."</p>
      <p>Haroche, a Casablanca-born professor at the College de France in Paris, won the award at the age of 68. </p>

      <p>Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai was awarded the <b>2004 Nobel Prize for Peace</b> in recognition "for her tireless contribution to "sustainable development, democracy and peace."</p>
      <p>In 1977, Maathai founded a grassroots campaign aimed at countering the deforestation that was hurting poor people, especially women, living in rural Kenya. Her so-called "Green Belt Movement", which encouraged women to plant trees, spread to other countries on the continent and contributed to the planting of tens of millions of trees.</p>
      <p>According to the Nobel Committee, her project was not just limited to work for sustainable development, but it included "democracy, women's rights and international solidarity".</p>
      <p>Maathai, who was born in 1940, was the first black African woman to receive the award, aged 64. She died in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, in 2011.</p>

      <h3>John Maxwell Coetzee</h3>
      <p>South African author John Maxwell Coetzee was awarded the <b>2003</b> <b>Nobel Prize in Literature.</b></p>
      <p>He was recognised for developing a style that "in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider".</p>
      <p>The Swedish Academy hailed the author as a "scrupulous doubter, ruthless in his criticism of the cruel rationalism and cosmetic morality of western civilisation".</p>
      <p>Born in Cape Town in 1940, Coetzee won the Booker Prize for 1983's Life &amp; Times of Michael K before. Over a decade later, he became the first author to win the prestigious British literary award twice with 1994's Disgrace.</p>
      <p>A recluse, he shunned both Booker Prize ceremonies but did go to Sweden's capital, Stockholm, to accept the Nobel.</p>

      <p>Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, an Algerian-born French scientist, was a co-recipient of the <b>1997</b> <b>Nobel Prize in Physics</b> for the "development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light".</p>
      <p>He shared the award with US physicists Steven Chu and William Phillips.</p>
      <p>The winners were praised for developing innovative techniques that use laser light to cool atoms to extremely low temperatures. In these temperatures, the atoms move slowly enough to be studied in detail.</p>
      <p>Born in 1933 in Algeria's Constantine, Cohen-Tannoudji was 64 when he won the Nobel.</p>

      <p>The three men were recognised for reaching the 1993 Oslo interim peace agreement.</p>
      <p>Arafat, the founder of the Fatah movement, was born in 1929 but the exact date and place of his birth are disputed. He always maintained that he was born in Jerusalem but several investigators cast doubt on the claim, saying he was born either in the Gaza Strip or Egypt's Cairo - hence his inclusion in this list.</p>
      <p>He died on November 11, 2004, at a hospital in Paris.</p>
      <h3>Nelson Mandela</h3>

      <p>South African freedom fighter Nelson Mandela was jointly awarded the <b>1993 Nobel Prize for Peace</b> for his work in ending the country's apartheid system of racial segregation and discrimination and for "laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa".</p>
      <p>He shared the prize with Frederik Willem de Klerk, South Africa's last white president whose negotiations with Mandela in the early 1990s helped end apartheid.</p>
      <p>One of the world's most recognisable fighters against inequality and oppression, Mandela spent 27 years in prison for his active opposition to the racist regime.</p>
      <p>A year after winning the Nobel, Mandela rose to become South Africa's first democratically elected president - a position that he voluntarily retired from after just one term.</p>
      <p>The iconic leader died on December 5, 2013, in Johannesburg. See a photo gallery of key moments of his life <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2013/12/pictures-mandela-life-201312634420854188.html">here</a>.</p>

      <p>South African author Nadine Gordimer received the <b>1991</b> <b>Nobel Prize in Literature.</b></p>
      <p>One of the most powerful voices against the injustice of apartheid, Gordimer published novels and short stories steeped in the drama of human life and emotion of a society warped by decades of white-minority rule. Some of her work was banned by the apartheid authorities.</p>
      <p>The Swedish Academy referred to her as an author "who through her magnificent epic writing has - in the words of Alfred Nobel - been of very great benefit to humanity".</p>
      <p>Some of Gordimer's most notable work includes The Conservationist (1974), Burger's Daughter (1979) and July's People (1981).</p>
      <p>Born in 1923, she died in Johannesburg on July 13, 2014.</p>

      <p>Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz won the <b>1988 Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988</b>, the first writer in Arabic to receive the award.</p>
      <p>He was recognised for a work "rich in nuance" that "formed an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind".</p>
      <p>Mahfouz is best known for The Cairo Trilogy, his saga about a modern Egyptian family living under British colonial rule between the two world wars.</p>
      <p>His first three novels - published in Arabic in 1939, 1943 and 1944 - were set in ancient Egypt.</p>

      <p>Anglican cleric Desmond Tutu won the <b>1984 Nobel Prize for Peace</b> for his opposition to apartheid in South Africa</p>
      <p>Tutu's objective was to see South Africa "as [a] democratic and just society without racial divisions", and despite violent attacks committed against the black population, he would adhere to a nonviolent line and encouraged the application of economic pressure by countries dealing with the apartheid authorities.</p>
      <p>After receiving the Nobel, Tutu used his international stature to step up the campaign against apartheid, leading calls for punitive sanctions against South Africa as one of the few strong voices inside the country, while others were imprisoned or forced into exile.</p>
      <p>In 1995, Mandela appointed Tutu head of the country's Truth and Reconciliation commission - the body set up to investigate apartheid-era crimes.</p>
      <p>Born in 1931, Tutu began his retirement from public life 0n October 7, 2010 - his 79th birthday - after decades of activism.</p>
