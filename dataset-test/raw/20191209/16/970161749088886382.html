      <h1>Cardi B addresses prostitution claims after suing two bloggers for defamation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:12:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">Mel Evans</a></address>
      <p>Cardi B has further denied claims she was a prostitute, after suing two bloggers for alleging she slept with men for money while working as a stripper.</p>
      <p>The Bodak Yellow rapper has been more than open about her stripper past before finding fame in the music industry, however has insisted she never worked as a prostitute.</p>
      <p>Squashing the rumours once and for all as so-called ‘baseless accusations about her old career’ continued to follow her, Cardi, 27, said she hated the insinuation that strippers automatically slept with men for money. To Cardi, she insisted doing such a thing would cause you to have a bad name in the community for ‘messing up the game’.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/cardi-b-cover-january-2020">told Vogue magazine</a>: ‘I just hate when people be like, oh, you used to be a stripper, so you’re a prostitute, you used to sleep with guys. I never used to sleep with guys.</p>

      <p>‘The thing about it is, when you’re known as a stripper that sleeps with guys for money, everybody hates you because you’re messing up the game. You’re making guys expect more than what you should be giving, and the next b*tch pays for it.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t have to give guys no a*s. You want something from me? I want something from you. I want your money, you want my time. So I’m just gonna give you time. Once you start expecting more, my phone number’s disconnected. Bye.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/23/cardi-b-suing-two-bloggers-defamation-call-prostitute-claim-stis-8993295/">Cardi filed a lawsuit against two bloggers</a> for hitting out at her in their videos – calling her a ‘prostitute’ and claiming she ‘takes drugs and has STIs’.</p>
      <p>Bloggers Latasha K and Star Marie Ebony Jones appeared to slam Cardi in several of their videos and it didn’t go down well with the rapper.</p>
      <p>TMZ reported that, according to the suit, Latasha posted a video that took aim at Cardi’s daughter Kulture, one, and claimed she ‘might be born with intellectual disabilities’ while accusing Cardi of taking drugs while she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>Star Marie, who used to live with Cardi, accuses her of taking drugs in a video she posted in September last year and called the star a ‘prostitute’, allegedly saying in the video: ‘Just a Grammy nominated prostitute running around spreading herpes.’</p>
      <p>Cardi vehemently denied the claims made by the bloggers, insisting she has never been a prostitute, been a drug user or had any form of STIs.</p>
