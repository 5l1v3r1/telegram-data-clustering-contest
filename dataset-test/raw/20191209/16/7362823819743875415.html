      <p>Rapper <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Juice WRLD</a> was reportedly traveling to attend a 21st birthday celebration in his hometown of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/chicago">Chicago</a> the night he died, after previously singing about how he didn’t expect to live past that age.</p>
      <p>The star turned 21 on Dec. 2, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5oOMw5gInF/?utm_source=ig_embed">posted on Instagram</a> that he would be "celebrating all week."</p>
      <p>Fox News confirmed Juice WRLD, whose real name is Jarad A. Higgins, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-juice-wrld-dead-21">died after landing at Chicago’s Midway Airport</a> on Sunday. Fox 32 reported that the rapper was in town for a birthday celebration.</p>
      <p>According to a source who spoke to <a href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/rapper-juice-wrld-was-supposed-to-attend-his-own-21st-birthday-party-in-chicago-on-day-he-died-source-says">Fox32</a>, Juice WRLD was going to attend a birthday party on Sunday night in his honor where many area rappers were expected to show up.</p>

      <p>The rapper had previously sung about dying early in an oddly prophetic rhyme on the track “Legends,” which contains a lyric about not living past 21. <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/08/juice-wrld-dead-dies-seizure-chicago-midway-airport-hospital/">TMZ</a> said that the track is about fellow musicians Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, who died in 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p>

      <p>“What's the 27 club? We ain't making it past 21," Juice sings in the song.</p>
      <p>The "27 club" is a group of singers who all died when they were 27, including Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.</p>
      <p>"The Medical Examiner's Office has been notified of the death of Jarad A. Higgins, a 21-year-old black male of the 18500 block of Pierce Terrace in Homewood Illinois," Natalia Derevyanny, spokeswoman for the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office, said in an email to Fox News.</p>
