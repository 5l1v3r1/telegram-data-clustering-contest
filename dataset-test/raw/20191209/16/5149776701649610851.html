      <h1>'I do believe this squad can achieve good things' - Neal Ardley backs Notts County players</h1>
      <h2>Magpies were frustrated by Sutton United at the weekend</h2>

      <p>Neal Ardley retains full belief his Notts County squad can achieve success this season, but must quickly rediscover their “mojo”.</p>
      <p>For the second successive home game, the Magpies were held at home as Sutton United snatched a 1-1 draw at the weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> have not posted a win in the league since a 4-0 victory at Woking at the end of October which has seen slip five points behind the top seven.</p>
      <p>Some fans are asking <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> to change his side in a bid to spark an upturn in results and the Magpies boss feels they are still capable of achieving their ambitions of a top-seven finish.</p>

      <p>“We can only have 16 players who can go into a matchday squad on any given Saturday,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Do you want to carry a 22-man squad with players who can’t get in the team? No.</p>
      <p>“The budget was already overinflated with the players who were already here.</p>
      <p>“So we had to do work in terms of getting players out to even it out.</p>
      <p>“It is difficult. But I do believe this squad can achieve good things. We’ve just got to get our mojo back.”</p>
