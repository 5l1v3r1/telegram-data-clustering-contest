      <p>Ruiz filmed the now infamous Peloton commercial in early September, titled The Gift That Gives Back. In the ad, Ruiz documented her year-long fitness journey in a series of videos that she compiled into a thank you video for her husband.</p>
      <p>The ad made its first appearance in late November. But, by early December - much to Ruiz and costar Sean Hunter's surprise, viewers had begun to lambaste the ad on social media, calling it sexist, misogynistic, humiliating and cringeworthy.</p>
      <p>Ruiz had already said of the commercial: 'I was happy to accept a job opportunity earlier this year from Peloton and the team was lovely to work with. </p>
      <p>'Although I’m an actress, I am not quite comfortable being in spotlight and I’m terrible on social media.So to say I was shocked and overwhelmed by the attention this week (especially the negative) is an understatement.'</p>
      <p>The commercial controversy and Ruiz's sudden notoriety drew the attention of Ryan Reynolds, who tapped her to star in a cheeky commercial for his Aviation Gin company, titled The Gift That Doesn't Give Back. </p>
      <p>In the gin ad, released Friday, Ruiz stares blankly into the camera for some time, before it's revealed that she's sitting at a bar enjoying a drink with her friends.</p>
      <p>The ad, which appears to be positioned as a continuation of the Peloton ad, sees Ruiz proclaiming that 'This gin is really smooth,' as her friends say, 'You're safe here.'</p>

      <p>After toasting each other, Ruiz says, 'To new beginnings,' before draining her glass. One of her friends then slides her glass over to Ruiz and says 'it's gonna be a fun night.'</p>
      <p>The commercial wraps up with a shot of Aviation Gin and a voice over of a character saying, 'You look great, by the way,' a statement which is being seen as a dig at the the Peloton ad.</p>
      <p>When sharing the ad with his fans, Reynolds tweeted: 'Exercise bike not included.'</p>
      <p>It comes as Ruiz's on screen husband slammed SNL's spoof, insisting it was not sexist. </p>

      <p>Canadian actor Sean Hunter, who works as an elementary school teacher, said: 'It was frustrating, actually, I’ll be honest. They said the new Peloton ad is labelled as sexist and it was there in bold. I disagree. </p>
      <p>'They’re reinforcing that that’s what people are thinking about it and I don’t feel that way. That’s not the truth about the commercial at all.' </p>
      <p>Hunter revealed he received a lot of social media hate since the release of the commercial, some haters going as far to attack him in his direct message inbox.</p>
