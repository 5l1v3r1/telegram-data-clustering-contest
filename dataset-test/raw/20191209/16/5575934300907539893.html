      <p>The hunt for the actress in Peloton’s viral holiday commercial is officially over.</p>
      <p>Actress Monica Ruiz revealed her identity on Saturday and issued a statement to Deadline that responded to the attention surrounding the ad.</p>
      <p>“I was happy to accept a job opportunity earlier this year from Peloton and the team was lovely to work with,” Ruiz said in a statement originally sent to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/12/ryan-reynolds-peloton-girl-aviation-gin-1202802971/">Deadline</a> on Saturday through her agency, LA Talent. “Although I’m an actress, I am not quite comfortable being in spotlight and I’m terrible on social media. So to say I was shocked and overwhelmed by the attention this week (especially the negative) is an understatement.”</p>
      <p>The ad, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pShKu2icEYw">released on YouTube</a> on November 21 and is being shown on TV, follows what appears to be a woman’s yearlong selfie journey after her partner gave her a Peloton bike for the holidays.</p>
      <p>The ad sparked confusion on social media after some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/peloton-holiday-commercial-is-sparking-hate-confusion-from-watchers-2019-12">criticised</a> it for being sexist and awkward. In a statement to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/04/peloton-says-its-disappointed-in-how-some-have-misinterpreted-ad.html">CNBC</a>, a Peloton spokesperson <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/peloton-responds-to-holiday-ad-backlash-report-2019-12">said</a> the company “was disappointed in how some have misinterpreted this commercial.”</p>
      <p>As many on social media wondered about the actress’ identity, Ruiz <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/ryan-reynolds-aviation-gin-ad-trolls-the-peloton-holiday-ad-2019-12">appeared in a commercial</a> for actor Ryan Reynolds’ gin label Aviation Gin, which poked fun at Peloton’s holiday commercial.</p>
      <p>“When Ryan and his production team called about <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/aviation-gin/">Aviation Gin</a>, they helped me find some humour in the situation,” Ruiz said in the statement. “I am grateful to both Peloton and now Aviation Gin for the work and giving me the opportunity to do what I love to do.”</p>
      <p>The male partner in the Peloton commercial, played by actor Sean Hunter, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/peloton-holiday-commercial-actor-husband-interview-responds-viral-ad-backlash-2019-12">experienced a lot of the backlash</a> from the ad, as many criticised his character’s apparent suggestion that his partner in the commercial should work out more.</p>
      <p>“My 5 seconds of air time created an array of malicious feedback that is all associated with my face,” Hunter <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/hk/blog/aesthetics-101/201912/disgraced-peloton-husband-speaks-out">told Psychology Today.</a></p>
      <p>Peloton did not respond to Business Insider’s request for comment.</p>
