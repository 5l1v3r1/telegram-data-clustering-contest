      <p>Despite scoring in his past two Serie A matches, the 34-year-old has endured a tough time in Italy in recent months.</p>
      <p>After his relationship with manager Maurizio Sarri took strain recently, Ronaldo is believed to be unhappy at the Bianconeri, whom he joined from Los Blancos in 2018.</p>
      <p>Following Real's win over Liverpool in the 2017/18 UEFA Champions League final last year, the Portuguese shocked many when he suggested it may have been his last match for the club, which eventually turned out to be true.</p>
      <p>Now, according to <i>ABC</i> newspaper, Ronaldo has told close friends and family that he wishes he had not left the Spanish giants, and that his decision to move on might have been a mistake.</p>

      <p>The report suggested that the Portugal captain was affected by missing out the 2019 Ballon d'Or, and feels he might have won the past two awards had he still been a Real player.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo won the prestigious award on four occasions during his time with the LaLiga giants, for whom he scored 450 goals in 438 games in nine years.</p>
