      <h1>Nick Cannon Suggests His Eminem Gay Sex Diss Lyrics Are True</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:47:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Following Eminem’s diss on Fat Joe’s <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/singles/id.37865/title.eminem-disses-nick-cannon-on-fat-joe-dres-lord-above">“Lord Above”</a> single, Em’s target Nick Cannon returned fire with <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53742/title.nick-cannon-calls-out-kim-hailie-alaina-on-suge-knight-led-eminem-diss-track-the-invitation">“The Invitation”</a> on Monday (December 9). According to the <i>Wild ‘N Out</i> host, Slim Shady had some secrets he didn’t want out there.</p>
      <p>“I heard your chauffeur got a video of you sucking a cock/You paid him off then laid him off/Now who really the opps,” he raps on the song. He later suggested that particular line wasn’t based on fiction.</p>
      <p>“FACTS!” Cannon tweeted. “His lawyers didn’t want that one out! They already on my line.”</p>

      <p>During the same Twitter session, Cannon also claimed Eminem is a lone wolf. After a fan suggested Em get <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53150/title.joe-budden-laments-over-extra-eminem-bullshit-that-contributed-to-slaughterhouses-demise">Slaughterhouse</a> for a response track, Cannon said, “He don’t even fuck with them!! He has no friends!!!”</p>

      <p>Eminem has been labeled homophobic for years. On his last album <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.3248/title.review-eminem-earns-the-revival-redemption-he-sought-with-kamikaze"><i>Kamikaze,</i> </a>he found himself on the defense once again after calling <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.4142/title.all-the-rappers-eminem-calls-out-on-kamikaze">Tyler, The Creator a gay slur</a> on the song “Fall.”</p>
      <p>Of course, he’s well aware of his reputation. In the 2014 film <i>The Interview,</i> Em makes a cameo appearance and jokingly comes out as gay but completely deadpans it.</p>
      <p>“I’m more shocked that people haven’t figured it out yet,” he tells James Franco’s character. “I’ve been playing gay peek-a-boo for years. I’ve pretty much been leaving a gay bread crumb trail.”</p>
      <p>Cannon apparently thinks he has proof this is true.</p>
