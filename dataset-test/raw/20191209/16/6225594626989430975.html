        <b>Nike is overhauling its retail strategy and ending the pilot program with Amazon, which brought its sneakers and apparel to the world’s most viewed storefront.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the era of mass e-commerce, one would think that most brands would fight for a place on Amazon. There is one that has decided against it, though; Nike. Here’s a little bit of the background:</p>
      <p>Back in 2017, Nike and Amazon entered a mutually beneficial agreement that would see the athletic brand start selling its products on the online marketplace. In return, Amazon would intensify its efforts in eliminating counterfeits from its platform.</p>
      <p>However, after two years, the deal is over. As first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/nike-will-end-its-pilot-project-selling-products-on-amazon-site">Bloomberg</a>, the company has decided to pull its products from Amazon to focus its efforts on distributing its products through a network of select retailers.</p>
      <p>There are rumors that the deal just wasn’t living up to Nike’s expectations, but whatever the truth may be, the brand has always had a tradition of creating immersive and exclusive retail experiences. Therefore, it would be safe to assume that Nike would also like to focus on a distribution network that preserves the brand’s ethos – rather than appealing to the mass market.</p>
      <p>The statement is further reinforced by the brand’s spokespersons, with sources saying that “as part of Nike’s focus on elevating consumer experiences through more direct, personal relationships, we have made the decision to complete our current pilot with Amazon Retail.”</p>
      <p>The news comes amidst a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/22/ceo-shuffle-nike-names-new-ceo-same-day-under-armour/2450170001/">wave of changes for the brand</a>, an important one being the departure of Mark Parker, the man who helmed the sneaker giant for the last 13 years. Board member John Donahoe will replace Parker as of Jan 13, 2020.</p>
