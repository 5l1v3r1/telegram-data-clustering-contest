      <h4>Our Reporter</h4>
      <p>The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has inaugurated the newly constituted boards for the Edo State Agency for the Control of HIV/AIDs (EDOSACA), Waste Management and the Edo State Internal Revenue Service (EIRS).</p>
      <p>He also swore-in the new Chairman for Etsako East Local Government Council, Mrs. Benedicta Ebuehi.</p>
      <p>Addressing members of the boards at Government House in Benin City, Obaseki described their inauguration as a call to service to assist his administration in deepening the dividends of democracy.</p>
      <p>He charged the board members for EDOSACA to ensure the HIV prevalence rate in the state is drastically reduced below the national average of 1.4 percent, noting, “I will like it to be below 0.5 percent and that means you have to intensify your efforts and focus on continued advocacy, access to relevant information, access to HIV testing services and treatment, care and support for people living with the virus.”</p>

      <p>He tasked members of the Waste Management Board to work hard in ensuring Edo State is the cleanest in the country, adding that cleanliness is a priority, as focus should be on maintaining a hygienic environment in cities outside Benin such as Auchi and Ekpoma.</p>
      <p>In his remark to board members of the EIRS, Obaseki noted that if the state must survive, emphasis must be on local revenue generation, adding, “The amount of traffic in the state shows that economic activity is booming, hence the agency should be able to generate revenue in the state.”</p>
      <p>While addressing the new Chairman of Etsako East LGA, the governor said the council must be efficient in its resource management to be at par with developments across the state.</p>
