      <h1>Minecraft Bedrock edition will launch tomorrow on PS4, adds cross-play</h1>

      <p>Sony has confirmed that Minecraft Bedrock edition will be released tomorrow on PS4, with this version of the game unifying the code across all versions of the game. This means that PS4 players will be able to play with those on Xbox One, Switch, mobile, and PC. Of course, Minecraft is already on PS4 and millions of people will own it already. Good news, current owners. Update 1.14 will add all the content that the Bedrock edition will have so no need to double-dip.</p>

      <p>The content, aside from cross-play, will include the Minecraft Marketplace where PS4 players will be able to get skins, mini-games, and packs. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/31/minecraft-bedrock-update-1-13-0-1130-ps4-xb1-pc-ios-switch-cross-play/">Back in October</a>, we got the first hint for the Bedrock edition when update 1.13.0 went live which had the line “Added PlayStation-related assets and translation strings into the game files.”</p>
      <p>So,cross-play and marketplace. PS4 players are now getting the experience everyone else had access to.</p>
