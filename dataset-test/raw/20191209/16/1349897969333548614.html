        <li>Bale and Nacho return to the squad for the match in Belgium this week</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane has called up 19 players for Real Madrid's final Champions League group game against Club Brugge this Wednesday. </p>
      <p>The French coach has left out Sergio Ramos and Toni Kroos, who will both rest ahead of the games against Valencia at Mestalla and Barcelona at Camp Nou in the coming week. </p>
      <p>Gareth Bale, who missed the Espanyol game at the weekend with a muscle problem, and Nacho, who's returning from two months out, have both been included, though. </p>
      <p>Madrid have nothing to play for in Belgium. Whatever happens they will come second in the group behind Paris Saint-Germain, while Brugge are in competition with Galatasaray for the Europa League spot. </p>
      <p>For that reason, Zidane is expected to make a number of changes to XI, with Eden Hazard, James Rodríguez, Lucas Vázquez and Marcelo all missing through injury.</p>
      <p><b>THE SQUAD:</b><br/>Goalkeepers: Courtois, Areola &amp; Altube.<br/>Defenders: Carvajal, Militao, Varane, Nacho, Odriozola &amp; Mendy. <br/>Midfielders: Modric, Casemiro, Valverde e&amp; Isco.<br/>Forwards: Benzema, Bale, Jovic, Brahim, Vinicius Jr. &amp; Rodrygo.</p>
