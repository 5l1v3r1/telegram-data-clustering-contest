      <h1>Raptors’ Kyle Lowry to appear as cannon doll in ‘The Nutcracker’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:44:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p>Six months ago, the 2019 NBA season culminated in the first championship of <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/kyle-lowry/266394">Kyle Lowry</a>‘s career as the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a> captured the Larry O’Brien Trophy.</p>
      <p>The veteran point guard will wrap up the year with another first: his debut as a cannon doll in the National Ballet’s performance of “The Nutcracker” in Toronto on Dec. 19.</p>
      <p>Lowry will be joined as a celebrity cannon doll by Canadian Paralympians Cody Caldwell and Mike Whitehead, Team Ontario wheelchair rugby and wheelchair tennis athletes Gillian Cruz and Anne-Marie Dolinar, Stars lead singer Torquil Campbell, co-founder of WE Marc Kielburger, soprano Measha Brueggergosman, comedian Candy Palmater, author Jesse Thistle and host of “Mary’s Kitchen Crush” Mary Berg.</p>
      <p>Lowry and the other celebrity walk-ons will be dressed as colourfully costumed Russian Petrouchka dolls, who fire a cannon into the audience in act one of the play.</p>
      <p>Last year, fellow athletes Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews of the Toronto Maple Leafs took on the role.</p>
