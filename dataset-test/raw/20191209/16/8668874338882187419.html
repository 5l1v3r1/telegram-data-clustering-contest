      <h1>Re-signing prop Waller tipped for England duty</h1>

      <p>Warriors loosehead prop <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/ethan-waller/">Ethan Waller</a> has described his decision to sign a two-year contract extension as one of the easiest he has had to make.</p>
      <p>Waller arrived at Sixways from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton">Northampton</a> Saints in the summer of 2017 and has established himself as crowd favourite and a respected figure among his team-mates as he is the club’s Rugby Players Association representative.</p>
      <p>Waller’s current contract is due to expire at the end of this season but he has now committed himself to Warriors until the end of 2021/22.</p>
      <p>“Re-signing was one of the easiest decisions I’ve made. I love the boys and the role I’m privileged to play in this squad,” Waller said.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>“I signed here nearly three years ago because I truly believed in the potential the club has and we’re really starting to show it.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the tightest groups I’ve been involved with and I’m ecstatic to be part of the journey over the next two years.”</p>
      <p>Waller is the seventh member of the current Warriors squad to put pen to paper on a contract extension following <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/ted-hill/">Ted Hill</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/andrew-kitchener/">Andrew Kitchener</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/francois-venter/">Francois Venter</a>, Nick Schonert, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/sam-lewis/">Sam Lewis</a> and Anton Bresler.</p>

      <p>Waller’s decision to commit his future to Warriors delighted Director of Rugby Alan Solomons who believes the 27-year-old has all the attributes to become an international front row forward.</p>
      <p>“It is brilliant news for the club that Ethan has decided to stay on here at Sixways,” said Solomons.</p>
      <p>“He is an absolutely outstanding loosehead prop and I have no doubt that it is but a matter of time before he plays for England.</p>
      <p>“He is a good scrummager and tremendous around the field. In addition, he is a great bloke and a terrific team man who adds huge value. I am overjoyed that he has elected to continue his career here at Sixways and look forward to working with him.”</p>
