      <p>CORNVILLE, AZ — Yavapai County Sheriff’s officials say a man was taken into custody over the weekend after the death of a man who was allegedly struck by a hammer.</p>
      <p>Officials were dispatched to a Cornville home around 6:30 p.m. on Saturday where a 22-year-old man was suffering from a severe head injury.</p>
      <p>Deputies found a large amount of blood at the scene and a hammer at the victim’s feet. They rendered first aid until the victim was taken by paramedics to a Flagstaff hospital, where he later died.</p>
      <p>YCSO says a relative of the suspect, 23-year-old David Schultz, told officials that Schultz admitted to striking the victim with a bat. The relative was concerned and went to check on the victim, which is when they discovered the “gruesome scene”.</p>
      <p>Officials were able to locate Schultz in a nearby trailer and took him into custody without incident.</p>
      <p>He was booked into jail on a second-degree murder charge and refused to comment on the incident.</p>
      <p>No further information has been released.</p>
