      <h1>Kanye West Glows Up In Silver Body Paint For "Mary" Opera</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">AllHipHop Staff</a></address>
      <p>The rap star stunned everyone when he came out for his "Mary" opera covered in silver paint.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Kanye West was covered head-to-toe in silver for his latest opera, "Mary."</p>
      <p>The rapper's most recent venture took place on Sunday (December 8th) at the Miami Marine Stadium and was accessible only via motorboat.</p>
      <p>As was the case with Kanye's previous opera last month, which received mixed reviews for its late start time and rough acoustics, the performance began after a one-hour delay at 4:00 pm.</p>
      <p>Staged on a floating barge at the Key Biscayne waterfront, the chorus stood between sand-colored mounds and reenacted excerpts from the biblical books of Matthew and Luke.</p>
      <p><a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/kanye-west-announces-sunday-service-opera-nebuchadnezzar-vI3-BniwzkGmsXGkdRR2Vg/">However, while the "Gold Digger" hitmaker only narrated his last opera, "Nebuchadnezzar," </a>he was painted in silver body paint and wearing a matching tunic for this week's performance, as he read gospel passages aloud and appeared as part of the physical interpretation.</p>
      <p>The chorus of performers was similarly dressed, and delivered new arrangements of older Kanye songs, including "Devil in a New Dress," "Love Lockdown," "Power," "I Thought About Killing You," and "Canâ€™t Tell Me Nothing." Christmas classics including "O Holy Night" and "Gloria in Excelsis Deo" were also performed.</p>
      <p>"Mary" ran for approximately one hour and, as the performers left the stage, they were whisked away via a motorboat, according to Variety.</p>
      <p>The opera is the latest project in which West has embraced his Christianity, as he has staged his Sunday Service gospel performances across the U.S., and is reportedly planning to team up with <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/kanye-west-taking-sunday-service-sermon-to-yankee-stadium-with-joel-osteen-sqD2CumwbkOfbBEQsCEY-A/">preacher Joel Osteen to stage a huge sermon at New York's Yankee Stadium in the coming months.</a></p>
