      <h1>All eyes on Lagarde’s ECB debut this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:24:19+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>Christine Lagarde delivers her first monetary policy announcements as ECB president on Thursday, with observers set to scrutinize every word for hints of the bank’s future direction at a time of stuttering eurozone growth.</p>
      <p>Lagarde is widely predicted to leave her predecessor Mario Draghi’s ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged after chairing her maiden meeting of the European Central Bank’s governing council in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>But the former International Monetary Fund chief can expect a grilling at the post-meeting press conference about her planned review of the ECB’s objectives and way of working.</p>
      <p>The timing and scope of the “strategic review” are still unclear, but the outcome could lead to a major shake-up amid calls for the ECB to rethink its inflation target and take more climate action.</p>
      <p>“This meeting will be more about Ms Lagarde setting out her stall as ECB president than it will be for policy decisions”, said Nomura bank economist Chiara Zangarelli.</p>
      <p>Lagarde — a lawyer and not an economist by training — has herself pleaded for patience, saying she has been on a steep “learning curve” since taking up the job last month.</p>
      <p>“I am trying to learn German, but I am also trying to learn central bank language,” the one-time French finance minister told MEPs last week, acknowledging the market-changing impact of even a single ambiguous word.</p>
      <p>“So bear with me, show a little bit of patience, don’t over-interpret.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tensions </b>
      </p>
      <p>In his final act as ECB chief, Draghi in September unveiled fresh stimulus to bolster the 19-nation euro area, which has been weighed down by US-China trade tensions, Brexit uncertainty and a weakening manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p>As well as offering a new round of cheap credit to lenders, Draghi slashed a key interest rate deeper into negative territory and kept others at historic lows.</p>
      <p>He also restarted a controversial bond-buying programme to the tune of 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a month, in the hopes of encouraging spending and investment.</p>
      <p>But several of the ECB’s 25 governing council members opposed the asset purchases, leading to an unprecedented public spat led by criticism from Germany’s Bundesbank central bank chief Jens Weidmann.</p>
      <p>One of Lagarde’s first moves upon arriving in Frankfurt was to take the council on a retreat to heal the rift — and ECB watchers will be keen for an update.</p>
