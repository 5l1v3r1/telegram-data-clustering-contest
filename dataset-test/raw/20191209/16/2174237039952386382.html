      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/stone-sour-we-dont-consider-rock-a-dirty-word">Stone Sour</a> have released a video for their <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/stone-sour-hydrograd-album-review-1"><i>Hydrograd</i></a> track <i>Whiplash Pants</i>.</p>
      <p>The song has been selected from the band’s upcoming album <i>Hello, You Bastards: Live In Reno</i> which is set to arrive this coming Friday (December 13) through Cooking Vinyl.</p>
      <p>It'll be released on CD, limited edition heavyweight vinyl and on digital and streaming platforms.</p>
      <p>Guitarist Josh Rand said: “This is the Reno show in its entirety, just how it went down on October 5, 2018. We’re extremely proud of the fact that it’s 100% live with absolutely no overdubs! It’s not perfect but neither are we. </p>
      <p>“As a collector myself, I wanted this limited edition release to be very special. The vinyl is pressed on 180g, giving you the best audio quality possible, and is limited to 2500 copies worldwide. I hope you enjoy this as much as we did playing it.”</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/stone-sour-didnt-know-they-were-being-recorded-for-live-album">Rand admitted the band had no idea the Reno show was being recorded</a> – telling the <a href="https://www.metalsucks.net/2019/11/25/stone-sour-guitarist-josh-rand-on-the-metalsucks-podcast-316/">Metal Sucks podcast</a>: “The initial plan was for us to record on the Russian tour. </p>
      <p>“The equipment came in a couple of days early and our tour manager/front of house guy ended up hooking it up just to test run it at the Reno show. He didn't tell any of us and he recorded the show. </p>
      <p>“The next day he says, 'Hey, guys. I recorded last night's show. Check it out.' We listened to it and we were all pretty stoked with the performance.”</p>
