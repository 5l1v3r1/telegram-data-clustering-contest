      <p>The eldest daughter of the Duke of York has been forced to cancel her planned engagement party next week at the Chiltern Firehouse due to fears there would be too many photographers looking for Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>Princess Beatrice only recently got engaged to property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi when he popped the question in September of this year.</p>
      <p>Following advice from pals and the royals, the couple have decided to reschedule their engagement party over warnings the venue they had chosen is too high-profile at this time, reports the Daily Mail.</p>

      <p>As a result, Beatrice and fiance Edoardo are changing the date and venue of the special occasion to a location more suitable so that Prince Andrew can evade the paparazzi.</p>
      <p>As you probably already know, Prince Andrew stepped back from his royal duties after his "car crash" interview with Newsnight's Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>Quizzed about his controversial friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Duke of York offered unsubstantial answers to the questions posed to him.</p>
      <p>It is also alleged by Virginia Giuffre that the prince slept with her when she was seventeen-years-old, allegations Prince Andrew vehemently denies.</p>

      <p>The prince has left the royals in a scandal which is only getting worse for the 59-year-old. Seemingly, it is now even affecting his eldest daughters wedding plans.</p>
      <p>It's not solidified just when the royal couple will tie the knot, however, with the mess which is currently happening the wedding may very well be delayed.</p>
      <p>In September of this year Princess Beatrice and Edoardo got engaged in Italy.</p>
      <p>At the time the palace said in a statement: "The Duke and Duchess of York are delighted to announce the engagement of Princess Beatrice to Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.</p>
      <p>"Her Royal Highness and Mr Mapelli Mozzi became engaged in Italy earlier this month. The wedding will take place in 2020."</p>
      <p>The couple said: “We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement. We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can’t wait to be married."</p>
