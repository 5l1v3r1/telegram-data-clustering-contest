      <p>It is also set to see guest cameos from Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver – although were not present in the preview clip.</p>
      <p>Harold Ramis, who played Egon Spengler in original film Ghostbusters in 1984 and its follow-up Ghostbusters II in 1989, died in 2014.</p>
      <p>The trailer shows a single mother and her two children moving to a mysterious, inherited house in a small town – which is hit by unusual and unexplained tremors – where they start to discover the connection to the original ghostbusters and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind.</p>
      <p>Rudd plays a teacher who becomes enthralled when he discovers old pieces of kit used by the ghostbusters.</p>
      <p>The trailer also has glimpses of ghost Slimer and the car from the original films, the Ectomobile, complete with its Ecto-1 number plate.</p>
      <p>The film is the fourth in the Ghostbusters franchise and the first since the all-female release in 2016 starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, who started a ghost-catching business in New York City.</p>
      <p>It was directed by Bridesmaids film-maker Paul Feig and received a mixed reception.</p>
      <p>Juno and Up In The Air director Jason wrote and directed Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and his father Ivan took on a producing role.</p>
      <p>Ghostbusters: Afterlife will be released in cinemas in July 2020.</p>
