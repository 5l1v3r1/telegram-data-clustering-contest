      <p>If you're still to scoop up an iPad deal in the holiday sales you're in luck. We've found the cheapest prices for each iPad model from a range of your favorite retailers this week. Many of these deals are Black Friday / Cyber Week discounts still in stock at various retailers, meaning there's still time to save on iPad Pro deals and more. There's also still a healthy stock of iPad Air, and Mini deals about - all still carrying their seasonal sales price tags. </p>
      <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday were fantastic times to shop for an iPad, with some of the lowest discounts on 2019 and last year's models we've seen in a while. Thankfully, a few of those sales linger on into this week, and we're still seeing decent discounts on iPad Pro and Air models as well as some cheaper prices on 2018's installments. </p>
      <p>If you're looking for the cheapest iPad deal possible, you'll likely be looking at lower storage items. Thanks to iCloud, the 32GB and 64GB storage options available are more than workable if you're looking to stream your entertainment and keep you larger files in the cloud. That said, if you're looking for a tablet to potentially replace your laptop, or if you're going to be running several high performance apps for some hardcore work, you might want to take a look at some of the roomier options. </p>
