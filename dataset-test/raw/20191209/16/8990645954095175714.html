      <p>'THE STARS AT NIGHT ARE BIG AND BRIGHT!'</p>
      <p>Coming up in 2020, it will be the 35th anniversary of the classic movie 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure'. Where Pee Wee Herman is trying to make it to Texas to get his awesome bike. Why Texas? A psychic told him that his bike was in the Alamo's basement.</p>

      <p>As you know, the Alamo has no basement. Along the way, Pee Wee runs into some crazy characters. Probably the most famous and still scares the crap out of me. Large Marge. I think I legit would fast forward through that scene for years.</p>

      <p>It's a great movie and if you love it. You will want to be at the 35th anniversary screening over in Austin. Pee Wee Herman himself will be there. His real name is Paul Reubens in case you did not know. He will be there for the screening and afterwards will tell some behind the scenes stories.</p>
      <p>The screening is happening March 6th, 2020 at ACL Live at The Moody Theater. Tickets go <a href="https://www1.ticketmaster.com/pee-wees-big-adventure-35th-anniversary-tour-with-paul-reubens/event/3A005786BF679C2D">on sale this Friday.</a> If you need to remember one thing, remember the Alamo.</p>
