      <h1>Galaxy A (2020) series could employ MediaTek’s high-end 5G solution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:34:44+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Mihai M.</a></address>
      <p>Samsung’s <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-a-2020/">Galaxy A (2020)</a> lineup, or at least some models from the upcoming series, could be equipped with MediaTek’s Dimensity 1000 5G chipset, according to a report by <a href="https://www.bgr.in/news/samsung-in-talks-with-mediatek-for-dimensity-1000-5g-chips-report-862700/"><i>BGR.in</i> </a>citing industry sources from Taiwan.</p>
      <p>Readers might recall that Samsung was reportedly <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/06/28/samsung-is-trying-to-become-a-5g-chipset-supplier-for-chinese-oems/">trying to supply Chinese OEMs</a> including OPPO and Vivo with its own 5G solutions earlier in the year. But the tables have turned, according to this fresh report. OPPO and Vivo are now both rumored to plan on acquiring the Dimensity 1000 5G chip from MediaTek, and interestingly enough, Samsung could do the same for its Galaxy A (2020) series.</p>
      <h3>A flagship-grade 5G solution for non-flagship Galaxy phones</h3>
      <p>While some Galaxy A (2020) devices <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a71-5g-could-be-headed-to-china">like the Galaxy A71 5G</a> could end up carrying the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exynos-980-5g-integrated-processor/">Exynos 980</a> chipset with an integrated 5G modem, this won’t be the case across the entire lineup. The recent report suggests that at least some models could rely on MediaTek’s flagship-grade 5G solution instead. It doesn’t mention where the existing <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2018/08/15/samsung-5g-exynos-modem-5100-smartphones/">Exynos Modem 5100</a> would fit into this new picture. Would it fade into obscurity while MediaTek’s 5G chip will take center stage?</p>
      <p>In theory, there should be room for both chipsets to coexist. Some Galaxy A (2020) 5G models would presumably adopt the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 5G chip, while other, lower-end models could make use of Samsung’s own Exynos Modem 5100, or Qualcomm’s solutions.</p>
      <p>As for the Dimensity 1000 5G chip, it was manufactured on a 7nm process (the Exynos Modem 5100 is based on 10nm FinFET) and delivers impressive on-paper figures, such as 4.7Gbps maximum downlink speeds. This technically makes it over two times faster than the Exynos Modem 5100 solution which can achieve maximum downlink speeds of 2Gpbs.</p>
      <p>We are unable to confirm the validity of this rumor at this point, so take it with a pinch of salt. But assuming that there’s some truth to it, what would you say if Samsung would turn to MediaTek for 5G solutions? Do you think the Dimensity 1000 5G chip would be a good fit for the Galaxy A (2020) series? Share your thoughts below.</p>
