        <b>Fintech pioneer and first direct founder Mike Harris has come out of retirement to take on the role of chairman at mortgage switching tool Dashly.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harris has a long history in the digital banking world as the man behind not only first direct but also Prudential Banking and its successor, Egg.<br/><br/>He is now backing Dashly and its 'always-on' mortgage switching tool, which is currently running its broker-only pilot exclusively through Paradigm Mortgage Services before making itself available to the wider broker community in January.<br/><br/>Says Harris: “More than any other sector, financial services feeds on people’s inertia. Dashly puts an end to this once and for all, which could be one of the most significant developments in financial services since the birth of internet banking. <br/><br/>"Always-on price comparison will have a real financial impact on people’s lives, especially in relation to their mortgages, where it can help borrowers save thousands of pounds a year and move up the property ladder far more quickly than they would otherwise."</p>
