      <h4>In brief: For computing enthusiasts waiting for a more faithful recreation of the beloved Commodore 64, Retro Games Ltd. appear to be fulfilling pre-orders for those living in Europe. Unfortunately, there's no current indication on a US shipping date.</h4>
      <p>Thanks to the nostalgic wave of retro machines that has yet to crest, we learned earlier this year that the 8-bit 1980s gaming machine was getting a <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/80678-full-size-recreation-commodore-64-arrives-year.html">proper, full sized version</a>. The C64, as it's called, was announced with a December launch window. Now, it seems the full-sized C64 is <a href="https://retrogames.biz/the-c64">available for pre-order</a> in Europe and will begin shipping soon.</p>
      <p>The Commodore 64 has already received tribute in the form of last year's <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/75634-commodore-64-mini-officially-launches-us-october-9.html">Commodore 64 Mini</a>, and like other <a href="https://www.techspot.com/products/audio-video/nintendo-nes-classic-edition.154210/">retro</a> <a href="https://www.techspot.com/products/audio-video/playstation-classic.191722/">consoles </a>before it, it served as a fun nostalgia trip (albeit on a smaller scale) but still received mixed reviews. Reviewers took particular issue with the joystick.</p>
      <p>The C64 not only promises a full-sized keyboard, but an updated joystick as well. The full-sized keyboard will also allow users to load their own programs with multi-disk compatibility. The C64 will offer three switchable modes: C64, Vic-20, and Games Carousel Mode. There's also support for 720p HD output at 60Hz or 50Hz. The Games Carousel mode will come with 64 pre-installed games.</p>
