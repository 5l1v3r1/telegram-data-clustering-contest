      <p>Most Americans don’t seem to care that much about the stock market’s performance.</p>
      <p>According to a poll, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7fdedb5e-152f-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385">conducted by the Financial Times</a>, and the Peter G Peterson Foundation, 61% of Americans said that stock movements “had little or no effect on their financial well being,” compared to the 39% who said “stock market performance had a ‘very strong’ or ‘somewhat strong’ impact.”</p>
      <p>The Financial Times added that only 40% of those surveyed said the stock market has been going up in 2019, and 18% even said it decreased. The S&amp;P 500 has been hovering at record highs, and the index is up 26% this year.</p>
      <p>The strength of the <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1203387521402638343?s=20">US economy</a> may even be key to Donald Trump’s reelection chances.</p>
      <p>Those who said they voted Republican were more likely to correctly say the stock market had gone up than Democrats – 58% of Republicans compared to just 25% of Democrats, respectively.</p>
      <p>The poll is part of a year-long <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/international?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">survey</a> tracking Americans’ thoughts on Trump, and if he has made things better or worse, as we move closer to an election next year.</p>
      <p>The newspaper outlined the methodology behind the FT-Peterson poll: It “was conducted online by Global Strategy Group, a Democratic polling group, and North Star Opinion Research, a Republican group, between November 19 and November 24. It reflects the opinions of 1,010 likely voters nationwide, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.”</p>
      <p>Trump has been very bullish about the stock market this year, and the FT says he has staked his election chances on the health of the markets.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1202939897109192704?s=20">tweet</a> from three days ago touted US equity gains: “Stock Markets Up Record Numbers. For this year alone, Dow up 18.65%, S&amp;P up 24.36%, Nasdaq Composite up 29.17%. ‘It’s the economy, stupid.'”</p>
      <p>In a separate poll from the survey respondents, 64% said that they either felt worse, or no better off financially, since Trump was elected as president in 2016.</p>
