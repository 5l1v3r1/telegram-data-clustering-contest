      <h1>Nintendo Switch indie livestream tomorrow</h1>
      <h2>From 6pm UK time.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:31:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Nintendo will hold an indie game focused presentation tomorrow, 10th December, at 6pm UK time.</p>
      <p>Named Indie World, it'll be a 20-minute long Nintendo Direct-style broadcast focusing on Switch indie games.</p>
      <p>You'll be able to watch it via the video embed below, and we'll of course report on all the big announcements shortly after.</p>
      <p>This week is a busy one for game announcements. Things kick off at 2pm with PlayStation's own version of a Nintendo Direct, State of Play.</p>
      <p>Then, on Friday, you can join us in the wee hours of the morning (from 1.30am) for The Game Awards. We're expecting a couple of things from Nintendo there, too.</p>
