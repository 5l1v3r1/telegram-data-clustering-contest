      <p><b>Eskom has implemented</b> stage-6 load shedding as the problems at the failed state-owned utility keep mounting.</p>
      <p>“We regret and sincerely apologise that stage-4 load shedding will move to stage-6 load shedding as from 6pm today as a result of a shortage of capacity,” the company said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“This follows a technical problem at the Medupi power station impacting additional generation capacity.”</p>
      <p>Stage-6 power cuts mean Eskom is shedding a massive 6GW of electricity from its national grid. Eskom has load-shedding stages between 1 and 8, with stage 8 involving the 8GW of power being removed from the grid. — <i>(c) 2019 NewsCentral Media</i></p>
