      <p>Banksy unveiled a poignant mural in Birmingham today - and Brummies showed they had really taken it to their art!</p>
      <p>Crowds flocked to see the powerful artwork in Vyse Street in the Jewellery Quarter after news broke that the mystery artist had been in the city.</p>
      <p>And crowds, young and old, then took it in turn to have their picture taken on what will now become an iconic bench, next to the powerful mural of reindeer taking off into the sky.</p>
      <p>An image of the Banksy and a homeless man called Ryan was posted on the fabled artist’s Instagram earlier today.</p>
      <p>Banksy said: “God bless Birmingham.</p>
      <p>“In the 20 minutes we filmed Ryan on this bench passers-by gave him a hot drink, two chocolate bars and a lighter - without him ever asking for anything.” #Banksy.”</p>
      <p>Martin Clarke, from nearby Vault 88, took a picture of the Banksy hours after it had been painted in the early hours of on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>It was secretly unveiled after two men in hi-viz vests had been working at the scene behind a tent from 5am.</p>

      <p>Martin said: “There is a lot of work going on around here like roadworks, so I thought no more about it.</p>
      <p>“At around 9am I took the picture of the homeless man.”</p>
      <p>By then the men in hi-viz jackets had left - sparking speculation that one of them was Banksy.</p>
      <p>Stephen Huntley, 49, from Hamstead, was among the crowds who turned out to see the artwork.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had to come and see it.</p>
      <p>“You would never have thought you would get to see one of these in the flesh, so to speak.”</p>

      <p>A man who said he was one half of music group The Yak Boys said: “I found out via social media.</p>
      <p>“Banksy is the best artist to come out of the UK.</p>
      <p>“He should do more in Birmingham in deprived areas because the rich can see this everywhere - but this is the only chance we get to see it.”</p>
      <p>Police had arrived at the scene this afternoon as the crowds swelled.</p>
      <p>And barriers were later put in place around part of the artwork.</p>
