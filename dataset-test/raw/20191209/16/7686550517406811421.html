      <h1>Tributes to 'much loved' member of staff who died during 'traumatic' day for Swansea primary school</h1>
      <h2>A book of condolence will be placed at the school this week for people to leave their memories of Carol Watts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:40:45+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Christie Bannon</a></address>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to a "much loved and respected" staff member who died at a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> primary school.</p>
      <p>Carol Watts, a teaching assistant in the nursery at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/st-thomas">St Thomas</a> Primary School, was suddenly taken ill on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>In a letter sent out to parents, headteacher Russell Dwyer called Friday a "traumatic day" and said a book of condolence would be placed in the school this week.</p>
      <p>The letter read: "On Friday morning, Mrs Carol Watts, one of our teaching assistants in nursery, was suddenly taken ill.</p>
      <p>"Despite the swift response of our staff members and the best efforts of the paramedics, Mrs Watts sadly died.</p>
      <p>"Friday was a traumatic day for us all but I am so grateful to the staff for putting the children first and coping until the end of the day.</p>
      <p>"I am sorry to afternoon nursery for cancelling the session but I hope you can see now why I had no choice.</p>
      <p>"Carol was a much loved and respected staff member who gave her best for the children in her care.</p>
      <p>"Since Friday, I have received a number of moving comments as to how she touched some of you and your children’s hearts.</p>
      <p>"For this reason, we will have a book of condolence this week that people can write in should they wish to share any memories of Mrs Watts.</p>
      <p>"This book will be outside the school office from Tuesday to Friday."</p>

      <p>Mr Dwyer stated that the last two weeks of term would be "difficult" but that the staff and community "will support each other".</p>
      <p>The letter continued: "We have two weeks left in school before we finish for Christmas and I can’t deny that they will be difficult for us as staff; however, we will continue to ensure that children have positive and memorable experiences because that is what we are here to do and they come first.</p>
      <p>"Staff have therefore decided there should be as little change as possible to planned events. I will keep you informed as we proceed.</p>
      <p>"Thank you as ever for your ongoing support. It is always appreciated but at this sad time, even more so.</p>
      <p>"We are a strong and close staff in a strong and close community and together we will support each other."</p>
      <p>The school, in Grenfell Park Road, has around 350 pupils on its roll, and was judged to be a good performing school following an inspection by Estyn in 2014, with strong leadership.</p>
      <p>Nick Williams, Swansea Council's director of education, said on Friday: "Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends, and everyone associated with St Thomas Primary School following this dreadful news.</p>
      <p>"The member of staff was suddenly taken ill and despite the best efforts of colleagues and the emergency services, has sadly passed away.</p>
      <p>"Support is in place for the whole school community."</p>
