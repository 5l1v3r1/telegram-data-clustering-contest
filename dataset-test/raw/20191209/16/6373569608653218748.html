      <h1>Plymouth family's Christmas 'ruined' as mice run riot in their home</h1>
      <h2>Residents of Lofoten Close say they've caught over 20 mice in the building but PCH have not resolved the problem</h2>

      <p>Plymouth people are fuming after an 'infestation' of mice has been running riot through their homes, defecating on their belongings and gnawing on Christmas presents.</p>
      <p>Residents living at Lofoten Close in <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/devonport">Devonport </a>say they've caught over 20 mice in the building, many in flats with young children, but <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-community-homes">Plymouth Community Homes</a>, which owns the building, have not eradicated the problem.</p>
      <p>One lady told Plymouth Live that Christmas is 'ruined' as 'presents which were wrapped have been ruined either by mouse pee and poop or by the mice gnawing at them' and residents are afraid to have relatives visit over Christmas as 'all you can smell when you walk into your home is mice pee'.</p>
      <p>Now, Plymouth Community Homes has confirmed it is aware of the issue and will be resending a pest control expert to the block to solve the problem.</p>

      <p>One resident of the building, who did not want to be named, sent Plymouth Live several images of the mice infestation.</p>
      <p>The resident said: "PCH opened up outside my kitchen wall to bleed the drain pipe as there was a blockage and ever since then we have all been infested with mice.</p>
      <p>"[It] started with just the one property having mice, and now there are at least nine properties that we are aware of that currently have them."</p>
      <p>The resident told Plymouth Live residents reported the issue to Plymouth Community Homes in October but the company did not send pest control until mid-November.</p>
      <p>Since then, a group of Lofoten residents have caught 'between 20-25 mice' in their building.</p>
      <p>The infestation is particularly concerning parents with young children, the resident said.</p>
      <p>The resident told Plymouth Live: "My neighbour had family coming down for Christmas which she has had to cancel now due to this infestation.</p>
      <p>"There is only so much we can all do with having kids around.</p>
      <p>"Last night my son was on his Play Mat in the frontroom and the next thing we see is a giant mouse (biggest we’ve seen yet!) was circling around him."</p>
      <p>"This morning my husband was cooking breakfast for the children before school and he saw one bouncing around in the kitchen. As it was a big mouse it’s probably pregnant so no doubt it’ll be having mice soon so more of them will be here," the resident added.</p>

      <p>Neighbours say they can hear the mice 'scratching' doors and cupboards and have seen them gnaw on presents and defecate on them.</p>
      <p>Residents are 'out of pocket' from having to throw away and replace food and presents that have been 'ruined', Plymouth Live has been told.</p>
      <p>One resident said: "This has ruined our Christmas for all of us. We have had to spend money we didn't have on traps bait.</p>
      <p>"Presents which were wrapped were ruined either by mouse pee and poop or by the mice gnawing at them."</p>
      <p>"We can't have relatives to stay as it's not fair on them, all you can smell when you walk into your home is mice pee.</p>
      <p>"It’s an awful place to be in, [and] we're unable to put poison down as most of us have pets and kids. " the resident added.</p>

      <p>Plymouth Community Homes has confirmed to Plymouth Live that it is aware of the issue.</p>
      <p>Head of neighbourhoods, Steve Ford said: "We understand residents of Lofoten flats are frustrated, and we’re working hard to get rid of the mice from their homes.</p>
      <p>"We had a pest control expert baiting the block within two days of receiving reports and they are visiting again later this week.</p>
      <p>"It does take time to control mice in homes but we’ll continue to work with residents to do everything we practically can to try to solve the problem as soon as possible."</p>
