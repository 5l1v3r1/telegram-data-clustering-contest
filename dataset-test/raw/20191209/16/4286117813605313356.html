      <p>A 55-year-old man died of a heart attack after he suddenly fell sick while waiting in queue to purchase onions at Gudivada in Krishna district on Monday.<br/><br/>Sambaiah came to the farmers' market (Rythu Bazaar) to purchase onions, being sold by the state government at a subsidised price of Rs 25 a kg, but suddenly collapsed.<br/><br/>According to sources, local people tried to rush him to hospital but Sambaiah died on the way.<br/><br/>Doctors confirmed that he died of a heart attack.<br/><br/>The Telugu Desam Party sought to raise the issue in the Assembly in the afternoon but was disallowed.<br/><br/>TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu questioned why the government did not make a statement on the man's death.<br/><br/>"A man died, standing in queue to buy onions. Why did the government not come out with a statement on this," Naidu asked at a press conference.<br/><br/>He also asked why the village volunteers, appointed by the government to deliver various services at the people's doorstep, failed to deliver onions.<br/><br/>The retail price of onions was at Rs 110-160 per kg in the state on Monday, according to market sources.</p>
