          <b>About a fifth of all breast cancers are triple negative, the hardest form to treat </b>
        </li>

          <b>Scientists at Mt Sinai in New York found a protein that fuels the tumors' growth</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>They developed a drug that can 'degrade' the protein to slow tumor growth in petri dish and animal studies  </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A drug that stops the the deadliest form of breast cancer in its tracks has been developed.</p>
      <p>The experimental therapy on triple negative breast cancer worked on human tumor cells grown in the lab and living mice.</p>
      <p>It prevented the disease spreading - a process called metastasis. Scientists are hopeful of similar success in humans.</p>
      <p>Triple negative breast cancer has few effective treatment options, migrates further than other types and is more likely to recur and prove fatal. Younger women are most prone.</p>
      <p>The medication called MS1943 destroys a protein known as EZH2 that fuels its growth - while leaving healthy cells alone.</p>

      <p>Dr Jian Jin, director of the Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery in New York, said: 'Our findings suggest EZH2 selective degraders such as MS1943 may provide an emerging therapeutic approach for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.'</p>
      <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the US. Around 271,000 women are diagnosed each year - up to a fifth being struck down with the most aggressive.</p>
      <p>In tests of miniature triple negative breast cancer tumors in petri dishes and in mice, blocking EZH2 completely prevented them from metastasizing.</p>
      <p>There's not yet a drug that can be used in women that manages the same thing, said Dr Jin.</p>
      <p>He said: 'Triple-negative breast cancer represents 12 to 20 percent of all breast cancers.</p>
      <p>'It has poor prognosis, high recurrence, a low survival rate and has higher incidence in African-American and Hispanic women.</p>
      <p>'Currently, there are no effective therapies for treating a substantial portion of patients.'</p>
      <p>They believe the new drug, described in Nature Chemical Biology, could also treat prostate cancer - the most common in men.</p>
      <p>Dr Jin said: 'The EZH2 selective degrader reported in this study is also an invaluable tool to test therapeutic hypotheses in other cancers.'</p>
      <p>The protein is over-expressed in many tumors - including breast and prostate</p>
      <p>cancers.</p>
      <p>He said: 'In breast cancer, EZH2 has been identified as a major driver for disease development and progression, and high levels correlate with poor prognosis.'</p>
      <p>Several clinical trials of EZH2 inhibitors have already shown promise in treating sarcomas and lymphomas - tumors that start in soft tissue and immune cells respectively.</p>
      <p>Dr Jin said: 'MS1943 contains chemicals that are very toxic to triple negative breast cancer cells - while sparing normal cells.</p>
      <p>'It's effective in living animals - suggesting pharmacologic degradation of EZH2 can be advantageous for treating the cancers that are dependent on EZH2.'</p>
      <p>His team also found MS1943 reduced EZH2 levels in lab tests on lymphoma cells and non-cancerous prostate cells.</p>
      <p>Dr Jin said: 'Our results suggest pharmacological degradation of EZH2 may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for triple negative breast cancer.</p>
      <p>'Furthermore, based on the oncogenic role of EZH2 in other cancers including prostate cancer, we hypothesise degraders could be effective in treating these tumours.</p>
      <p>'MS1943 is a valuable tool to test this therapeutic hypothesis.'</p>
      <p>An estimated 268,600 new cases of breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2019 in the US - with as many as one-in-five being the dreaded triple negative.</p>
      <p>Chemotherapy is considered effective but the cancer often comes back - with a vengeance.</p>
      <p>Triple negative breast cancer is a form of the disease that does not have receptors for the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, or the protein HER2.</p>
      <p>This makes it trickier to treat due to the tumour not responding to these hormonal or protein therapies.</p>
      <p>The condition is more common in those under 40 and black women. It is diagnosed via a sample of the cancerous cells.</p>
