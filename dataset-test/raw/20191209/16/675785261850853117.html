      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:14:28+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom, Richard Wheeler</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson sparked outrage today by flying just 90 miles in a gas-guzzling 72-seat plane instead of taking his own election battle bus.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister was condemned after taking aides and journalists on the half-hour flight this morning from Doncaster Sheffield Airport to Teesside Airport - despite the same journey taking around an hour and 43 minutes on the road.</p>
      <p>It comes despite the Tory leader's allies claiming his plan for government would be the greenest in history - even greener than the Green Party.</p>
      <p>Last month Chancellor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp">Sajid Javid</a> said the manifesto would be "the most green manifesto any party has ever published".</p>
      <p>Yet today Mr Johnson took a plane for almost two thirds of the 156-mile journey between Grimsby Fish Market and Fergusons Transport, near Washington, Tyne and Wear.</p>

      <p>The distance between the two airports, on what is thought to have been a charter plane, would be around 90 miles on the roads, according to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> Maps.</p>
      <p>It's true that if Mr Johnson had wanted to go all the way from Grimsby Docks to Sunderland by rail, it would have taken more than four hours and three changes.</p>
      <p>But Doncaster and Darlington - the two stations nearest the two airports he used - are connected by a direct train that takes just 55 minutes.</p>
      <p>Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist Doug Parr said: “It’s absurd and unacceptable for anyone to take a flight for a journey that could be done less than an hour by train.</p>
      <p>"Not least the prime minister, who should be leading by example. It makes his lack of ambition for tackling the issue glaringly obvious.”</p>
      <p>Aaron Kiely, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Saving half an hour of travel time has resulted in a journey that’s far worse for the planet.</p>
      <p>"It’s impossible to see what benefit could come from flying over such a short distance rather than using a train, or even campaign bus.</p>
      <p>"Nobody, including the prime minister, can get away from the fact that fewer planes in the sky will help to fix the climate crisis.”</p>

      <p>Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald added: "How can <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> say he is committed to bringing down emissions when he's prepared to take unnecessary and environmentally damaging flights?</p>
      <p>"Boris Johnson is living proof that the majority of flights are taken by the privileged few, while the rest of us pay the price of global heating.</p>
      <p>"Under a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> government we'll make sure that our trains and buses are properly invested in, so that Boris Johnson can make more environmentally friendly decisions in the future."</p>
      <p>The Alsie Express twin-propeller plane has around 72 seats and was around two-thirds full when the PM and his team took the short hop.</p>
      <p>It was delivered in 2018 to Azerbaijan Airlines and is registered in Denmark and flies at 2,515ft.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was subjected to a bumpy ride as he flew to Teesside airport mid-morning.</p>
      <p>The windy conditions could be felt by those on the plane, particularly ahead of landing.</p>
      <p>As he got on board, Mr Johnson earlier joked about the "pungent aroma" of the fish, which was still present on everyone involved in the first visit to Grimsby.</p>
