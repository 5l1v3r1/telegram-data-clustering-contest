      <p>A drunk raccoon has been shot dead after staggering through a German <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/christmas/index.html"><b>Christmas</b></a> market before passing out underneath a bin after drinking too much mulled wine.</p>
      <p>At noon on Saturday, amused Christmas shoppers at the Erfurt market saw the furry creature stumbling between the stalls. </p>
      <p>The unsure animal was seen crossing tram tracks before playing with a woman's shoes.</p>

      <p>The raccoon then enjoyed a rest on the steps of someone's home, before having a snooze under a bin.</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson told <a href="https://www.bild.de/regional/thueringen/sachsen-anhalt-news/erfurt-betrunkener-waschbaer-torkelt-ueber-weihnachtsmarkt-66543718.bild.html#fromWall"><b>Bild </b></a>the raccoon had nibbled on leftovers of mulled wine mugs.</p>
      <p>He said the animal was 'obviously intoxicated', but said: 'However, a breathalyzer test on the animal was not carried out.'</p>
      <p>A security guard at the Christmas market noticed the raccoon and took him in before alerting the authorities. </p>

      <p>But then remarkably it was shot dead by a local hunter despite plans to take it to an animal shelter. </p>
      <p>It is not yet known where the animal had come from. </p>
      <p>In the same city last year, police found two drunk hedgehogs near the cathedral who had been gorging on some discarded advocaat.</p>
      <p>The animals were then taken in by the local zoo. </p>
