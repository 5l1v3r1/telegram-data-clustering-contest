      <h1>Harrowing warning of mum after son, 17, died from Tramadol overdose</h1>
      <h2>William Horley, 17, died last year, after overdosing on the painkiller Tramadol</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:49:08+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Goodwin, Tom Pyman</a></address>
      <p>A devastated mother whose teenage son lost his life to drugs is touring schools to warn kids about the dangers of substance abuse.</p>
      <p>William Horley, 17, died last year after overdosing on the painkiller Tramadol.</p>
      <p>He fell unconscious and was rushed to hospital, but could not be revived, <a href="https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/william-horley-17-drug-overdose-2484244">KentLive</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Now William's mum, Kim Webster, 48, is trying to warn others and paint a picture of how difficult her life has been since he died, telling her story to teens in schools across Kent.</p>
      <p>She said: "They are really shocked when I tell them what I've had to do in that time.</p>

      <p>"No-one realises how much you have to do when someone dies.</p>
      <p>"I ask them to think of their own mums, putting them in that position, saying 'this is what your choice could lead to.'"</p>
      <p>Kim tells school kids about the horror of identifying her son's body and how she had to decide between burying or cremating the child she gave birth to - as well as dealing with the police, coroner and the media.</p>
      <p>When a group of young people dabbles with drugs, Kim notes that there can be a reluctance to call the emergency services through fear of getting into trouble themselves.</p>
      <p>However she is keen to hammer home the message that doing so can save lives.</p>

      <p>Kim said: "Will didn't want it to happen, it was just a naive moment of stupidity. I'm trying to tell them they're not invincible, it can happen to anyone.</p>
      <p>"I completely understand that you don't really listen to your parents growing up, you think you're old enough and that you're going to make your own choices.</p>
      <p>"If someone passed you something in a bag, you wouldn't want to eat it, but once they have it in their mind that they want to try it, there's no going back.</p>
      <p>"Is it really worth that 15-minute buzz to make the wrong choice?"</p>
      <p>Will, a 6ft 6in fitness fanatic, had dreamed of joining the Army prior to his death.</p>

      <p>Kim added: "One head teacher told me I have Will's life to lead - they said 'he was being trained to save lives and you've got to carry on saving lives'. That blew me away."</p>
      <p>Rehabilitation charity the Kenward Trust is working with local stakeholders to improve education about the dangers of drugs.</p>
      <p>The campaign - dubbed 'Think Differently' - involves visits to schools to engage with young people, raising awareness of the issues and potential consequences of substance misuse.</p>
      <p>The family of Owen Kinghorn, a 15-year-old promising footballer who died after taking a drug for the first time, have also thrown their weight behind the campaign and have already raised more than Â£3,000.</p>
      <p>The charity is already operating in 75 schools across Kent, but hopes to expand its network to include all 203 schools and colleges across the county.</p>
