      <h1>EU and African banks sign $120 million climate action facility</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:38:30+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.esi-africa.com/author/pamela/" target="_blank">Pamela Largue</a></address>

        <b>The European Investment Bank and the Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Banks (TDB) have signed a deal to fund sustainable energy projects over the next 15 years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two banks signed a $120 million SME and climate action facility to fund climate action, renewable energy, and energy efficiency projects.</p>
      <p>The establishment of the facility comes after up to 65% of the African population is directly impacted by climate change, while only 4% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
      <p>Ambroise Fayolle, European Investment Bank Vice President, said: “The largest ever cooperation between the EIB and TDB will support a total of EUR240 million of new investment across Africa. Scaling up climate-related private sector investment is key for climate action and saving our planet.“</p>
      <p>This is the second line of credit to be extended by EIB to TDB, the first one having been signed in 2014 for €80 million.</p>

      <p>Admassu Tadesse, TDB President, said: “Alongside these lines of credit, we are also thankful for EIB’s technical assistance support to TDB via which world-class training sessions were delivered to our staff, among other activities.</p>
      <p>“Half of our portfolio is, directly and indirectly, contributing to SDGs; 70% of our energy portfolio is in renewables; and apart from our regular operations, we have recently launched an SME programme to address the missing middle-SME financing gap. Our multifaceted partnership with EIB will enable us to step-up our commitment to delivering triple-bottom-line results in the region we serve.”</p>
