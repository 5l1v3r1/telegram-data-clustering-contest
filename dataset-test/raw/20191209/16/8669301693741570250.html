      <h1>Boxing: Khatana, Kalaivani lead the way as India bag six gold medals at South Asian Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:13:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>National champion Ankit Khatana (75kg) and rising star Kalaivani Srinivasan (48kg) led India to six boxing gold medals even as World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik could only win a silver medal at the 13th South Asian Games in Kathmandu on Monday.</p>
      <p>In men’s category, Vinod Tanwar (49kg), Sachin (56kg) and Gaurav Chauhan (91kg) were the others who finished on top, while Parveen (60kg) was the other woman pugilist to take the gold for India.</p>
      <p>In the men’s 49kg final, Bhutan’s Tashi Wangdi proved no match for Tanwar, who easily cruised to a 5-0 win.</p>
      <p>Sachin was equally impressive and hardly broke a sweat against Bangladesh’s Mia Md Robin in 56kg, soaring to a win by the same scoreline.</p>
      <p>Khatana was unstoppable and stamped his authority over Sri Lanka’s Dinesh Maduranga Don Pathirage in the middleweight summit clash on his way to a commanding 5-0 victory.</p>
      <p>Gaurav Chauhan faced some stiff resistance from Pakistan’s Sanaullah early on in their 91kg face-off but was soon able to find his punches that helped him notch up a 4-1 win.</p>
      <p>While his compatriots performed upto the expectations, it was Manish Kaushik’s 64kg final loss that was the biggest surprise for the entire contingent.</p>
      <p>Kaushik was at his menacing best throughout the tournament but was outdone by Nepal’s Bhupendra Thapa, who recorded a huge 5-0 upset win.</p>
      <p>“Today man of the match goes to Vinod Tanwar in my view, the opponent was a rough puncher. He took him very easy by step back punch and sidestep punch and won the match by 5:0.</p>
      <p>“Manish’s opponent was very rough and he received 1 or 3 clear punches. It was unfortunate but this tournament was definitely a good experience for him,” said India’s men’s boxing chief coach, CA Kuttappa.</p>
      <p>The women, in contrast, had to fight hard for the gold.</p>
      <p>One of the most promising talents, Kalaivani showed her resilience in her 3-2 victory over Nepal’s Maharjan Lalita in 48kg.</p>
      <p>Parveen too showed her guts and gumption in a brave 3-2 triumph over Nepal’s Sunar Sangita in 60kg but 2017 Asian Championship bronze medallist Shiksha bowed out 0-5 to Minu Gurung of Nepal in 54kg.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Vikas Krishan (69kg), Narender (+91kg), Sparsh (52kg), Varinder (60kg) will be aiming for the gold from the men, while Pinki Rani (51kg), Sonia Lather (57kg), and Manju Bamboriya (64kg) will be hoping for a top-podium finish in women’s category.</p>
