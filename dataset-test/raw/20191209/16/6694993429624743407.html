      <h1>Erling Haaland responds to transfer links again amid Manchester United speculation</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd have been linked with Erling Haaland as a result of his impressive start to the season in Austria.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:26:45+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Corless, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/liam-corless/</a></address>
      <p>Erling Haaland once again batted away questions about his future as he prepares for the biggest match of his career against Liverpool.</p>
      <p>If RB Salzburg beat Liverpool by two or more goals and Napoli beat Genk on Tuesday night, the defending European champions will drop into the Europa League in the new year.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erling-haaland">Haaland's</a> focus is firmly on the task in hand, as he made clear after being asked about his future at the Austrian club for the umpteenth time in a pre-match press conference on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I’m just focused on my job: playing football. I try to enjoy what I do every day, and go in with a clear mindset and enjoy the moment right now,” Haaland said.</p>
      <p>“My focus now is on Salzburg and me as a player. It is not hard at all. I am enjoying every day playing football.</p>
      <p>“My father (Alf-Inge Haaland) was a former player so he has been helping me but I also have a lot of friends who also help me in these situations.</p>
      <p>“Doing what I am doing every week it is not easy but that’s what I try to do. My father has been helping a lot.</p>
      <p>“This is the biggest game of my career so far. Matches like this are what you dream of so I am enjoying it. I’m living the dream.”</p>
      <p>Salzburg manager Jesse Marsch said: “This not a new theme, there has been a lot of talk. At one point we had a joke at a press conference that every day there was a new team interested.</p>
      <p>“It is natural. Erling has had a great season and it is easy to see he is likeable and cares about the right things.</p>
      <p>“You don’t see him in the team every day like I do and that’s what makes him special, he cares so much about the team and team success."</p>
