    <meta property="og:description" content="Republican lawyer Steve Castor seemed to forget about some previous impeachment testimony during his own appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday. Castor argued that Ukraine didn't feel pressure from President Trump to investigate his domestic political arrivals and that the country's government wasn't even aware of a freeze in U.S. military aid until the end of August. Previous witnesses in the House Intelligence Committee's hearings, however, had a different story. Their testimony claimed that at least some Ukrainian officials knew about the hold up the same day as Trump's infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which spurred the impeachment process. How strange that Castor repeats the argument that the Ukrainians didn’t know the aid was withheld until late August, when we have documents and testimony dating it to July 25 if not earlier. — Blake News (@blakehounshell) December 9, 2019 #CastorLiesCastor: Ukraine officials &quot;did not learn it was paused until the pause was reported…"/>

      <p>Republican lawyer Steve Castor seemed to forget about some previous impeachment testimony during his own appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday.</p>
      <p>Castor <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1204060848588763138">argued</a> that Ukraine didn't feel pressure from President Trump to investigate his domestic political arrivals and that the country's government wasn't even aware of a freeze in U.S. military aid until the end of August. Previous witnesses in the House Intelligence Committee's hearings, however, had a different story. Their testimony claimed that at least some Ukrainian officials knew about the hold up the same day as Trump's infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which spurred the impeachment process.</p>

      <p>There's also the word of a former Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal who <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/881900/first-ukrainian-official-publicly-acknowledges-senior-officials-knew-about-aid-freeze-during-trump-pressure-campaign">said</a> (after she resigned) she knew about the aid situation by July 30.</p>
