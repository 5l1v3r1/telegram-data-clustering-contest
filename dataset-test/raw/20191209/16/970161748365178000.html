      <h1>Chris Cornell's widow suing Soundgarden for alleged unpaid royalties</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:05:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Chris Cornell’s widow is suing his band Soundgarden for alleged unpaid royalties in a row over seven of the late star’s songs.</p>
      <p>Vicky Cornell, who married the Black Hole Sun singer in 2004, has filed legal documents arguing that Soundgarden are withholding hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties, which she claims are owed to her and Chris’s children Toni, 15, and Christopher, 14.</p>
      <p>In legal papers filed by attorneys Marty Singer and James Sammataro, Vicky accused the band of making ‘an unlawful attempt to strong-arm Chris’ Estate into turning over certain audio recordings created by Chris before he passed away’.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit regards seven songs which Vicky claims were ‘solely authored by Chris; contain Chris’ own vocal tracks; and were bequeathed to Chris’ Estate’.</p>
      <p>However, Soundgarden – Kim Thayil, Matt Cameron and Ben Shepherd – argue that there were other members who co-wrote five of the seven songs and said they were ‘working on the files in a collaborative effort’ before <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/18/chris-cornell-dead-soundgarden-and-audioslave-musician-dies-aged-52-6645084/">Chris’s death in May 2017.</a></p>

      <p>In a letter to Vicky, the band says: ‘The entire band was feeling very positive about their rekindled artistic energy and creativity’ before Cornell’s death.</p>
      <p>However, Vicky claims that Soundgarden has ‘resorted to pressure tactics, harassment, unlawful conversion of royalties, and extortion’ and claims that Kim Thayil was ‘callously agitating the band’s rabid fan base’ by suggesting she is blocking the release of new music.</p>
      <p>Vicky wrote on Instagram: ‘I have been taking time these past few weeks to be grateful for all the good people around me and for those who have lifted me up at the very worst times in my life. The silver lining, during the storm, is finding and appreciating the subtle glow of those who sincerely support you in your life unconditionally. However, sometimes while you grieve the one you physically lost, you realise that you must now grieve the loss of some of those you considered friends and family as well.</p>
      <p>‘I am shocked at how often this occurs. It’s not just me, or the rock-star widow, or the political widow; it is the case for the vast majority of women after their partners have passed. It transcends socio-economic class, race, and religion. It is an unpleasant and unfortunately all too common theme. Hard-hearted family members, friends, and business associates; who will exploit a widow’s vulnerability when she’s broken and alone. These other people who have decided that her time is up as well.</p>

      <p>‘Through support groups and other widowed friends, and during both difficult and supportive conversations, I have learned that I am not a unique case. This seems to be the inevitable plight of the widow in this world and I cannot help feeling angry, sad and betrayed. I will not be bullied or shamed into silence. I will not accept something so wrong, so lacking in compassion or decency, even with the clear but unspoken threat of social rejection hanging over me.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘This was not the way I would have chosen to move forward. But I will not be pushed aside for someone else’s convenience or gain. I will not sacrifice our children’s futures for someone else’s greed. And I will not let someone else make me feel shame because the man I loved was taken from all of us too soon.</p>
      <p>‘I will do justice by my husband’s work and memory; for our children and for everything we stood for. I want to thank everyone who has stood by Chris and has supported us through this devastating time. Your love and your kindness will never be forgotten.’</p>
      <p>Soundgarden retired the band name in 2018, but reunited to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/17/brad-pitt-turns-support-chris-cornells-children-memorial-concert-8357580/">perform in a tribute concert for Cornell this year.</a></p>
      <p>Chris – also the lead singer of Audioslave – was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit on 18 May 2017, shortly after performing at a Soundgarden concert.</p>
      <p>His death aged 52 was ruled a suicide.</p>
