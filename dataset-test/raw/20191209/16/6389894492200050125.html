      <p>The value of fines issued by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) this year has soared to £391.8m.</p>
      <p>Research from law firm RPC found the level of fines so far this year was up more than 550 per cent on the £60m levied last year.</p>
      <p>The increase in fines by the FCA has been driven by a crackdown on the mis-selling of financial products, which accounted for £163m, and the mis-reporting of financial data, which accounted for £62.6m.</p>

      <p>The increase in fines from the FCA has been driven by a crackdown on mis-selling of financial products, which accounted for £163m of the total fines issued by the FCA, and mis-reporting of financial data, which accounted for £62.6m.</p>
      <p>The FCA reinforced its commitment to protecting consumers from financial mis-selling in its 2019-20 business plan. </p>
      <p>The largest fine issued to a financial institution for mis-selling in the last year was £30.8m for Standard Life for mis-selling pension annuities.</p>

      <p>The regulator has also cracked down on misreporting transactions as its relies on data from banks to spot discrepancies on deals that could indicate fraud or market abuse.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs was hit with a £34.3m fine in March for failing to provide complete and timely data on a raft of transactions over a 10-year period.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Cary, partner at RPC said: “Banks have been firmly in the FCA’s firing line this year, with huge penalties levied. </p>
      <p>“After several years of relatively low levels of fines, the FCA is baring its teeth.”</p>
      <p>The FCA declined to comment.</p>
