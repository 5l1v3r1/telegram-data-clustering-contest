      <p>NEW DELHI: Petrol price on Monday hit Rs 75 a litre mark for the first time in more than a year as oil firms raised rates to make up for rising cost of production.</p>
      <p>Petrol price was on Monday hiked by 5 paise per litre and diesel by 10 paise a litre, according to daily price notification of state-owned oil firms.</p>
      <p>The increase pushed price of petrol to Rs 75 per litre in the national capital and that of diesel to Rs 66.04 per litre.</p>
      <p>Rates have been on the rise since November 9, barring one day. Cumulatively, petrol price has been increased by Rs 2.30 per litre in the last one month.</p>
      <p>Diesel prices, however, have been moderate in their movement, hovering in between Rs 65-66 per litre range.</p>
      <p>While prices rose in the immediate aftermath of drone attacks on some of Saudi Arabia's giant onshore fields in mid-September, rising by a cumulative Rs 2.5 per litre in case of petrol in a matter of two weeks, rates had cooled off thereafter, with prices coming down from Rs 74.61 per litre to Rs 72.60 for petrol in Delhi.</p>
      <p>However, rates have again been on the rise since November 9, partly because of rupee-dollar exchange rate.</p>
      <p>Diesel prices had hit Rs 67 in the aftermath of the Saudi attack, but moderated in the days thereafter.</p>
      <p>Petrol and diesel prices are revised daily on the basis of changes in their benchmark international fuel prices and rupee-dollar exchange rate.</p>
