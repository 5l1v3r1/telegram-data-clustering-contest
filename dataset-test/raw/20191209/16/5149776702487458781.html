      <h1>Look inside the Carlton pub grotto with own ice kingdom and Christmas train</h1>
      <h2>Advance tickets to the festive pop-up sold out in a matter of days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:53:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>Narnia was found through a wardrobe, Neverland was past the second star on the right and, as it turns out, Santa's most over-the-top grotto is hidden in the upstairs' function room of a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/carlton">Carlton</a> pub.</p>
      <p>A true labour of love, husband and wife publican team Louise and Brian Howard-Blades, have been piecing together the winter wonderland pop-up at the Nag's Head, in Carlton Hill, since the end of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a>.</p>
      <p>New for this year is a magical ice kingdom area and new 'hop-in' <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> train, handmade by Brian, the muscle behind his wife's elaborate plans.</p>
      <p>"We had ladders criss-crossing on the stairs," says Louise, who started the tradition with Brian eight years ago, back in their hometown of Doncaster.</p>

      <p>"Health and safety is not a priority," the 43-year-old laughs, "I did say we could get some of that scaffolding but he said there wasn't enough time. He's always up and down ladders I'm convinced he'll be in hospital with a broken leg before Christmas."</p>
      <p>He's avoided disaster thus far however, which is just as well as he'll be playing the main man himself during grotto opening hours. Advance tickets sold out within a matter of days but there are still some walk-in places available.</p>
      <p>"We saw 18 children in just two hours on Friday," says Louise, who is already drawing up plans for a possible Easter grotto.</p>
      <p>"I hate taking down the Christmas decoration down, I wish they could stay up all year but realistically if we want to start building new props we have to get started in the new year," she adds.</p>
      <p>It's the third time have brought a sprinkling of Yuletide magic to the Nag's Head.</p>
      <p>To start with there was just an armchair for Santa and a red curtain backdrop but now it has bloomed into an all-signing, all-dancing interactive festive bonanza.</p>
      <p>Open until Christmas Eve, Santa will be in his grotto 4pm-6pm daily except on Saturdays.</p>
      <p>Visits are Â£4.50 a child and includes a selection box and a book as well as plenty of time to check out the moving ornaments, train sets, elves, gingerbread men, reindeer, nut crackers and animatronic animals.</p>
