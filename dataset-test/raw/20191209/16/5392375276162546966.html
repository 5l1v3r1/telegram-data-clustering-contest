      <p>With the end of the Galaxy S10 Android 10 beta program, Samsung is working hard to deliver the update for the Note 10 duo. Last week, the company rolled a fourth beta version for the Galaxy Note 10 duo.</p>
      <p>Now, we have new information regarding the official release of the stable version for the Galaxy Note 10 &amp; Note 10+. It will start to roll out before the end of this year. The community manager at Samsung’s <a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8/%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B810-10-%EC%A0%95%EC%8B%9D-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%86%8C%EC%8B%9D/td-p/2991875">official forum</a> in South Korea has confirmed it. It is the same guy who has a record to announce the accurate dates of Android 10 beta updates. The fixed release date has not unveiled yet, but the other guy with the user name Galaxy3813 has mentioned that stable update would release before December 25. He is a brand ambassador at the Samsung Community forum &amp; helping others in beta testing.</p>
      <p>This means that the 4th beta will be the last one for the devices. The beta community manager has also confirmed that the Galaxy Fold is not going to get the beta version. Last week, the company has declared any Galaxy A series devices will not get the beta version, instead, they will get a stable version.</p>
