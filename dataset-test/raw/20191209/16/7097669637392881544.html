      <p>A man has been arrested after a would-be thief tipped a woman out of her wheelchair on a train and attempted to steal it.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Cctv">CCTV</a> footage of the incident shows a man dressed in a red jacket and reindeer slippers, who lept out of his seat and grabbed the handles of the wheelchair as the train approached a station.</p>
      <p>The woman sitting in the chair can be seen desperately grabbing onto the railings inside the carriage as the attacker attempts to steer her out of the open doors.</p>
      <p>He eventually forces the woman to let go before throwing her onto the floor and running off with the wheelchair.</p>
      <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona said a number of passengers intervened and chased after the man during the attack at about 3.40pm on Friday 29 November. The assailant was tackled and eventually fled empty-handed.</p>
      <p>The Phoenix Police Department said 26-year-old Austin Shurbutt had been arrested in connection with the incident.</p>
