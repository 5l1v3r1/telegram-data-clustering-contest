      <p>A 28-year-old man has been arrested over the theft of a double ATM from a Tesco supermarket in Antrim town last week.</p>
      <p>The man was being questioned today on suspicion of conspiracy to steal and possession of class B drugs.</p>
      <p>A digger was used to rip two cash machines from the wall of the Tesco Extra store on Castle Way early on Friday morning. The digger was later set alight.</p>
      <p>Around half an hour after the raid, the machines were found on the Birch Hill Road - a few miles from the supermarket.</p>
      <p>It is understood cash was still in the machines when they were recovered.</p>
      <p>Detectives are continuing to examine the ATMs as part of their investigation.</p>
      <p>Police set up a dedicated taskforce early this year after cash machines across Northern Ireland were targeted in a string of robberies.</p>
      <p>The number of smash and grab robberies dropped over late spring and summer.</p>
      <p>However, criminals have tried to steal several ATMs over the last few months.</p>
      <p>In September, thieves attempted to take a cash machine from a service station in Enniskillen.</p>
      <p>Last month, a petrol station's forecourt roof in Ballynahinch, Co Down was torn down in an attempted ATM robbery.</p>
      <p>In the same month, thieves tried to rip a cash machine from Belfast City Hospital before ramming the shutters of a string of businesses in the city and Lisburn.</p>
