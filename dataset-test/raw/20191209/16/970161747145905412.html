      <p>A 32 year-old teacher sexted inappropriate images of herself to two 14 year-old students, sheriff’s deputies say.</p>
      <p>Science teacher Ashley Henson Beasley is said to have shared the X-rated photos and videos with the boys she taught at Hunters Creek Middle <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> in Onslow County, North Carolina.</p>
      <p>Beasley, a married mother of three was arrested on Friday, two days after Onslow County Sheriff’s Office were alerted to an anonymous tip the school had received about her alleged behavior.</p>
      <p>A spokesman explained: ‘The information was that a teacher at Hunters Creek Middle School was having an inappropriate relationship with two 14-year-old male students.</p>
      <p>‘An investigation by the Sheriff’s Office Special Victim’s unit was began immediately thereafter and revealed that Ashley Henson Beasley sent inappropriate photos and videos of herself to two of her students at the Hunters Creek Middle School.’</p>
      <p>Sheriff’s deputies have yet to say what the images showed, or give further information on how Beasley’s alleged crimes were spotted by the tipster.</p>
      <p>She has been charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of felony indecent liberties with a student by a teacher.</p>
      <p>Beasley is being held at Onslow County Sheriff’s Detention Center on $80,000 bond and is due in court Monday.</p>
      <p>She resigned and surrendered her teaching license last Thursday.</p>
      <p>Beasley had only started working at Hunters Creek in August this year.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Onslow County Schools said: ‘Our heart goes out to all of those who have been affected by the events that have resulted in charges being filed against Ashley Beasley.’</p>
      <p>The spokesman added that the allegations made against Beasley were ‘in stark contrast to our expectations.’</p>
