      <h1>Teen potheads caught smoking in police car</h1>

      <p>While most drug users would run away or cringe in fear at seeing a police car, this group of marijuana users in Quezon City turned one into a hotbox for their pot session.</p>
      <p>But their smoking stint in the mobile patrol car gave them a ‘bad trip’ early Monday morning as it led them straight to jail when lawmen pounced upon them.</p>
      <p>The ages of the eight teenagers nabbed in the car ranged from 18 (suspect Jovert dela Peña) to 13, the youngest.</p>
      <p>A report at Camp Crame in Quezon City stated that the operation stemmed from a tip of a local resident. The patrol car had long been parked at a local auto shop for repair.</p>
      <p>At around 1 a.m. on Monday, local police received a call about a group of teens holding a pot session inside the police car. A team of policemen were immediately sent to the area, leading to the arrest of the eight suspects.</p>
      <p>Confiscated from them were a small glass tube containing dried leaves of suspected marijuana weighing 2.45 grams and a small piece of crumpled paper with traces of dried marijuana leaves.</p>
      <p>The seven minors were turned over to the local office of the Department of Social Welfare and Development.</p>
      <p>Dela Peña, as an adult, was detained and is now facing drug charges.</p>
      <p>Local police officials could not be contacted for additional details.</p>
