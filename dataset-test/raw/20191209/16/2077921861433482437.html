      <h1>Lizzo Takes a Page From Beyoncé's Book in "Good As Hell" Marching Band Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:02:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author">Ellen Johnson  </a></address>
      <p>More than three years after it was released as the lead single from her 2016 <i>Coconut Oil</i> EP, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Lizzo">Lizzo</a>’s recently reemerged positivity anthem “Good As Hell” is getting the video treatment. The official music video premiered Monday morning and features Louisiana Southern University’s marching band and color guard.</p>
      <p>Lizzo brings a little sparkle to the Baton Rouge HBCU’s band rehearsal room as students dance around campus before taking the party on the road with a bag of Cheetos in tow. The video was shot during Southern University’s 2019 Homecoming Week and eventually shows snippets of a halftime performance. The outro features <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Lizzo">Lizzo</a> tinkering with a piccolo and making friends with students.</p>
      <p>The video recalls Beyoncé’s <i>Homecoming</i> special for Netflix, which stitched clips from games and pep rallys at HBCUs around the country with footage from her iconic 2018 <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Coachella">Coachella</a> performance, aka “Beychella.” Her now-legendary twin sets—one for each weekend of the California festival—featured Bey and dozens of dancers and performers decked out in symbolic marching band garb.</p>
      <p>Lizzo’s take on the topic is more specific since she singles out one school. The whole visual is an energetic delight including all of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Lizzo">Lizzo</a>’s trademarks: twerking, flute (or, in this case, piccolo), and smiles all around. “Good As Hell” was a career turning point for the singer back in 2016, and we named it one of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/best-songs-of-the-2010s-1.html">the best songs of the 2010s</a>.</p>
      <p>Watch Lizzo’s new “Good As Hell” video below. While you’re at it, watch the rapper/flautist extraordinaire perform “My Skin” in 2016 at the <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Daytrotter">Daytrotter</a> venue in Davenport, Iowa, via the <i>Paste</i> vault.</p>
