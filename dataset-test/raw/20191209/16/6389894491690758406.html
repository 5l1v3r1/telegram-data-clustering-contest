      <h1>Election 2019: Government adviser in altercation as health secretary visits Leeds General Hospital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:55:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Catherine Neilan</a></address>
      <p>A government special adviser has been involved in an altercation at Leeds General Hospital, during a visit by health secretary Matt Hancock.</p>
      <p>Hancock had been dispatched to the hospital after pictures emerged of a four-year old boy with suspected pneumonia sleeping on the hospital floor with coats for cover.</p>
      <p>However, Labour activists then turned up at the hospital in order to protest the Conservatives who are blamed for cutting resources to the NHS as a result of austerity.</p>
      <p>Multiple journalists have reported the incident, which appears to have occurred after the two groups met.</p>

      <p>Hancock’s intervention comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was criticised for his tone-deaf response to the picture of Jack Williment-Barr.</p>
      <p>Johnson has repeatedly dodged the matter, instead offering a general apologie to anyone who has had a bad experience in A&amp;E. He has also pledged to invest more in the NHS, and framed it as an issue relating to the Brexit delay.</p>
      <p>Johnson even took a journalist’s phone away during an interview, rather than look at the picture.</p>
