      <p>GO mBEANNAÍ Dia daoibh and welcome to an exceptionally friendly Bluffer’s Guide to Irish.</p>
      <p>This is the time of year when we get a little bit closer to family but also to <b>cairde</b> - friends.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are many kinds of friend.</p>
      <p><b>Dlúthchara</b> is a close friend as is <b>cara mór</b>.</p>
      <p>A nice phrase, if you are addressing someone you are very close to, is </p>
      <p><b>a chara na gcarad</b> - dearest friend. </p>
      <p><b>Cara cléibh</b> is a bosom friend and <b>cara rúin </b>- a confidante.</p>
      <p>Of course, not all friendships are that close. We all have superficial friendships - with <b>comhghleacaithe</b> - colleagues at work or people we meet in the street or ex-classmates for example.</p>
      <p>The Bluffer is the kind of person who always likes to make new friendships. </p>
      <p>Some people say “I have enough friends” but how many is enough?</p>
      <p>How many close friendships do you have, dear reader? Is that enough.</p>
      <p><b>Tá mó sháith cairde agam </b>- I have enough friends and to be honest two to six good friends is probably all you would need, but, hey, the more the merrier.</p>
      <p>You might only consider people <b>taobh amuigh den teaghlach</b> - outside the family as friends but some families are very close and members could be considered as friends in that case.</p>
      <p>We, of course, are hurtling towards the season of <b>cóisireacha Nollag - </b>Christmas parties which fill some of you with orgasmic delight while put the fear of God into others.</p>
      <p><b>Ní maith liom cóisireacha nuair nach bhfuil aithne agam ar dhuine ar bith</b> - I don’t like parties where I don’t know anyone is a sentence for all you wallflowers out there.</p>
      <p>Other people of course are dab hands at having conversations with anyone they meet. </p>
      <p>“<b>Is breá liom cóisireacha ar a bhfuil cuid mhór daoine </b>- I love parties where there are lots of people.</p>
      <p>Work outings can be hit or miss. Sometimes, colleagues find they have nothing to talk about <b>seachas</b> - apart from work and the chat inevitably gets round to how awful the boss is, while others stare into their turkey and ham and the bubbles die in their prosecco.</p>
      <p>Or worse, they manoeuvre you into a corner to tell you about their recent bout of <b>deir</b> - shingles or how Greta Thunberg is really the Anti-Christ or how their spouses are <b>ar mire le héad </b>- madly jealous and rarely let them out of the house – as they place their hand in your thigh. </p>
      <p>So maybe a better option is for you to organise a party in your own home – by invitation only to people who are guaranteed fantastic craic and company.</p>
      <p>Whichever you choose, hopefully friendships will be cemented and new ones formed over this festive period and beyond. Friends aren’t just for Christmas, you  know.</p>
      <p>The Bluffer is blessed with a small number of but close friends and family members,, others aren’t so lucky.</p>
      <p>Real friendships rarely die so, if you have <b>seanchairde </b>- old friends that you haven’t seen in a while, why not give them a buzz, send them a text and ask them out for a coffee and a catch-up.</p>
      <p>It’s always good to talk.</p>
