      <p>The ruling party of nationalist Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban submitted plans to parliament on Monday to tighten control over theatres, a decision - prompting protests from artists who see artistic freedom at risk, Reuters writes.

A public petition urging parliamentarians to reject the bill has gathered more than 47,700 signatures.</p>
