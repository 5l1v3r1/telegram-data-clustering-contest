      <p>Peter Kay is in talks with the BBC for a new project, according to a newspaper report.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old comedian was forced to cancel his first stand up tour in eight years and take a break from work last December "due to unforeseen family circumstances" - with his last TV appearance coming in the finale episode of Car Share in May 2018.</p>
      <p>But now it is being reported that the Phoenix Nights star has held discussions with the Beeb for a new project to "fill the void" left by the sitcom.</p>
      <p>An insider told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> that a "conversation" has taken place.</p>

      <p>"There is no rush and whatever happens will always be dictated by Peter but a new project has been discussed," the unnamed source is reported to have said.</p>
      <p>Peter performed in the comedy with actress Sian Gibson - and she teased earlier this year that the door could be open for a return.</p>

      <p>She told <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/1076413/Peter-Kay-news-Car-Share-NTA-Awards-2019-Sian-Gibson-relationship">the Express website</a>: "We left it open. Maybe, maybe not.</p>
      <p>And last November, the Welsh performer hinted they were working on a new TV show.</p>

      <p>She said to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/7807692/peter-kay-comeback-limelight-break/">The Sun</a>: "I was with Peter the other day and we have got something in the pipeline. There are things to think about."</p>
      <p>Car Share came to a conclusion after Sian's character Kayleigh walked out on Peter's John, prompting upset fans to organise a petition - signed by over 100,000 people - for another ending. </p>
      <p>Consequently, two more episodes were broadcast - and saw the duo drive off together in a bus.</p>

      <p>Sian admitted she preferred the updated finale, saying: "That was the final, final one. I liked the conclusion because they got a happy ending."</p>
      <p>And Peter admitted he was shocked by how the petition took off,  saying it was "incredibly flattering" to see the support for the show - while Sian confessed she'd put her name to the letter more than once.</p>
      <p>The comic fave Peter <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44198822">reacted</a>: "You'd never believe that it'd ever have that kind of effect. A petition."</p>
