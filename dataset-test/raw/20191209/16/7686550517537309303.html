      <p>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! winner Jacqueline Jossa has updated fans on how she's doing in an adorable Instagram video with her two daughters - and she's wearing her wedding ring again.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old triumphed over Coronation Street star Andy Whyment and DJ Roman Kemp in the live final on Sunday night after spending three weeks in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline was <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/jacqueline-jossa-children-imaceleb-reunited-17385512">sweetly met by her husband Dan Osborne at the end of the bridge</a> amid cheating claims and when she saw her daughters, she broke into a run to scoop them up and the waiting crowds cheered.</p>

      <p>While the I'm a Celeb runners-up have already appeared on various television shows talking about their time in the jungle, Jacqueline reportedly <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/jacqueline-jossa-cancels-tv-interviews-17388010">cancelled all TV appearances</a> - with a close source to the star telling MirrorOnline it was so she could spend time with her family.</p>
      <p>But earlier today, Jacqueline, who is still in Australia, broke her silence in an Instagram video featuring her two daughters, Ella, four, and one-year-old Mia.</p>
      <p>She told her fans: "Hello everybody. Thank you so much for voting for me. If you voted, it means the absolute world I cannot quite believe it's happening to me.</p>
      <p>"I just want you all to know that I am absolutely fine.</p>
      <p>"It has been the best experience of my whole entire life. And my babies are here."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline's time in the jungle was overshadowed by rumours TOWIE star Dan had cheated on her but eagle-eyed fans would have spotted that her wedding ring was firmly back on her finger.</p>
      <p>While she was in the jungle, campmate and Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson reportedly told her that Osborne cheated on her with Stephenson's ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>The pair were previously in the Celebrity Big Brother house together.</p>
      <p>Amid speculation over the status of their relationship, Dan, who supported his wife throughout her stint in the jungle, proudly posted a photo of the pair on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>He captioned the image: "My jungle Queen!! ❤️ words can not describe how proud I am of this woman! She absolutely smashed it from day 1 and deserves this sooo much!! Well done baby ❤️❤️❤."</p>
