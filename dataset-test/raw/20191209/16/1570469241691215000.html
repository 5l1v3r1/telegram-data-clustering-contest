      <p>More than 160 cars were vandalised in a Palestinian neighbourhood of Jerusalem with anti-Arab slogans scrawled nearby, Israeli police said Monday, in a suspected hate crime.</p>
      <p>The cars in the Shuafaat neighbourhood of <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/palestine-liberation-organisation-welcomes-eu-court-ruling-on-labelling-israeli-settlement-goods-261607">east Jerusalem</a> had their tyres slashed, with slogans such as "Arabs=enemies", "There is no room in the country for enemies" and "When Jews are stabbed we aren't silent" scrawled in Hebrew with red paint nearby, photos published by Israeli media showed.</p>
      <p>Police said their forces "continue to search the area for the suspects who fled the scene."</p>
      <p>A local official told public broadcaster Kann that footage revealed the vandalism took place overnight under the cover of the rain, and that the perpetrators were religious Jews.</p>
      <p>The incident bore the hallmark of a "price tag" attack, a euphemism for Jewish nationalist-motivated hate crimes that generally target Palestinian or Arab Israeli property in revenge for nationalistic attacks against Israelis.</p>
      <p>"Three masked settlers sneaked into the neighbourhood early and damaged the tyres of cars on the <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/palestine-president-mahmoud-abbas-points-finger-at-netanyahu-trump-administration-at-unga-252447">main street</a>," said Maysa Abu Khdair, a resident whose car was targeted and whose surveillance cameras caught the scene.</p>
      <p>"My daughter went on foot to school in the rain," she added.</p>
