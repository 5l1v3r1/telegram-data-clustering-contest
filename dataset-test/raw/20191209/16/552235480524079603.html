      <p>A shamed teacher who admitted making sleazy and inappropriate comments to eight pupils was today placed on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/child-sex-abuse">sex offenders</a> register.</p>
      <p>Maths <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/schools">teacher</a> Nat McMullen's  victims at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> school where he taught were girls aged between 12 and 16.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Glasgow Sheriff Court</a> heard he told a 16-year-old girl in front of her class: “I would pay 20 quid to look up your skirt,” pretended to spank another girl and pinned a third girl against a wall.</p>
      <p>All his victims were upset and some broke into tears because of his conduct.</p>
      <p>The court heard that McMullen, 70, retired in 2007, before returning to work in 2014.</p>
      <p>His lawyer Nicholas Nimmo claimed that McMullen, who started his career as a teacher in 1972, had adapted his teaching style to the modern world.</p>
      <p>Nimmo added: “He was trying to build a rapport and get street credibility.</p>
      <p>“He was using the language that the pupils were using in the classroom.</p>
      <p>“Part of his way of dealing with it was by the way of humour.”</p>
      <p>McMullen suggested to another girl that she should sit on his knee which made her feel “extremely uncomfortable.”</p>
      <p>He cornered a 12-year-old girl in a corridor and at one point touched her hip with his left hand to restrain her.</p>
      <p>In a police interview, the girl said: “I felt petrified as teachers don’t put their hands on me.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to move away from the wall and he wouldn’t let me move at all and that’s when I started crying as I got a fright and I froze.”</p>
      <p>A support teacher said McMullen made other inappropriate comments to girls such as “Who wants to be my girlfriend?”</p>
      <p>A 14-year-old was asked by McMullen to take off her shirt in one of his maths classes.</p>
      <p>The girl said she was “embarrassed and humiliated” by McMullen’s comment.</p>
      <p>Earlier that year, the same girl sprayed Victoria’s Secret perfume in one of McMullen’s classes.</p>
      <p>He asked her if she also bought her underwear from Victoria’s Secret.</p>
      <p>In August last year, a 15-year-old female student said McMullen came up behind her and squeezed her.</p>
      <p>The court heard McMullen made other comments such as “You fancy me” and then asked a girl who dropped her homework if it was a “love letter for me?”</p>
      <p>There were several complaints made to the school by the pupils and parents.</p>
      <p>McMullen apologised and told them that he felt “unwell” and took a few days off work before resigning.</p>
      <p>His wife was acting head teacher during some of the incidents.</p>
      <p>Parents were “dissatisfied” with the way the complaints were dealt with by school staff.</p>
      <p>McMullen was charged with conducting himself in a disorderly manner and repeatedly making gestures and uttering comments of an inappropriate and sexual nature towards the children.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alan Findlay deferred sentence on McMullen for reports until January next year.</p>
      <p>McMullen, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, was also put on the sex offenders register in the meantime.</p>
      <p>After the hearing, one of the victim's parents hailed the ruling as a "victory for the kids."</p>
      <p>They added: "He he has ruined a lot of children's lives - it’s a position of trust that he was in.</p>
      <p>"You send your kids away to school thinking they are going to be safe.”</p>
