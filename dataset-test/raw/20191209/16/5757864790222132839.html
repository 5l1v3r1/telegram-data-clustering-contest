      <p>Every year ends with a <i>cold moon</i>—the name given to a full moon that appears in December. The full <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/568413/winter-solstice-ursids-meteor-shower-and-cold-moon-tonight">cold moon</a> that's lighting up skies in 2019 will come with a bonus spectacle for sky-gazers. As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2019/12/06/when-and-where-to-watch-the-cold-moon-kiss-this-week-as-venus-and-saturn-appear-super-close/#7fb5ed9a1bd7"><i>Forbes</i></a> reports, a planetary "kiss" between Saturn and Venus will coincide with the last full moon of the year. Here's what you need to know about the astronomical events.</p>
      <h3>What is a Full Cold Moon Kiss?</h3>
      <p>The full moon of each month has a unique nickname associated with the time of year it occurs. A cold moon happens as temperatures drop and winter settles in, hence the name. December's full moon has also been called the <i>long nights moon</i> by some Native American tribes and the <i><a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/space-astronomy/full-cold-moon-december-2019">moon Before Yule</a></i> in Europe, according to <i>Travel and Leisure</i>.</p>
      <p>This year's moon will be visible the night of December 11 through the morning of December 12. On this same night, the planets Venus and Saturn will appear closer than usual in the night sky. The celestial bodies will be less than 2° apart and share a celestial longitude, a phenomena known as a <a href="https://www.space.com/42673-december-full-moon.html"><i>conjunction</i></a> or a planetary "kiss."</p>
      <h3>How to See the Full Cold Moon Kiss</h3>
      <p>During twilight on Tuesday, December 10, the bright planet Venus and the dimmer planet Saturn will arrive at their closest conjunction, 1.8° apart, above the southwestern horizon. The following evening, they'll be just .01° further away. Stick around the night of Wednesday, December 11 to catch the full cold moon, which reaches peak illumination at 9:12 p.m. on the West Coast and at 12 minutes after midnight on the East Coast.</p>
      <p>Not planning on staying up late to see the moon reach its fullest state? Moonrise on December 11 will be just as spectacular. When the moon surfaces around sunset, it will appear <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/595469/full-harvest-moon-coming-in-september">larger and more reddish</a> in color in the sky. Meanwhile, Venus's and Saturn's kiss will be visible 180º away.</p>
