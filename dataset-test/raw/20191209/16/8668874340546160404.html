      <h1>Watch: Painful footage of Lood de Jager injury is released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:49:05+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>Rugby World Cup winning lock Lood de Jager has given an update on the state of his shoulder, after he was forced from the field in the final against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in November. </p>
      <p>The 26-year-old left the pitch clutching his left shoulder after 21 minutes of play in Yokohama, and it was later revealed that he suffered a dislocation. He has since had surgery on his shoulder, and has shared footage on Instagram of what looks like a surgeon showing how unstable his shoulder was. </p>
      <p>The video shows the lock’s shoulder moving freely as it is manipulated in footage that some may find gruesome. </p>

      <p>This is the second time that the second row has had surgery in 2019, after he missed three months of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> season for the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/bulls">Bulls</a> following an operation to his right shoulder at the beginning of the year. </p>
      <p>This injury is expected to keep him out of playing for a longer period, however, and has significantly delayed his debut for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> Sharks, for whom he signed for over the summer. However, he may still be able to feature for Steve Diamond’s side towards the latter stages of the season. </p>
      <p>For now, this is the beginning of his road to recovery, which started with his shoulder being in a very bad state.</p>
