      <p>A cyclist has brought festive cheer to the streets of <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/london/index.html"><b>London</b></a> by riding a 79-mile route around the capital in the shape of a reindeer. </p>
      <p>Anthony Hoyte, 51, cycles long distances along intricate routes so that they appear in the shape of animals on his Strava fitness tracker. </p>
      <p>His latest work is his third annual <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/christmas/index.html"><b>Christmas</b></a> image, which he believes is his greatest yet. </p>
      <p>Mr Hoyte, of Cheltenham, cycled 79 miles from Hammersmith, west London, zigzagging across the city and finishing in Euston, to make a reindeer shape on his app.</p>
      <p>It took him nine hours, going as far north as Edgware, before heading south again and east through Hampstead Heath and Wood Green.</p>
      <p>Finally he returned south through Kilburn and Maida Vale before finishing along the Euston Road. </p>
      <p>He said: 'I'm pretty happy with it. You plan them all out but until you get back and upload it, you're not quite sure whether it's going to work or not.</p>

      <p>'I live in the countryside and it's very different to coming into London,' he said. 'Particularly around Neasden and Wembley, it's not the most pleasant cycling.</p>
      <p>'That's about my maximum distance - I wouldn't want to go too much above that. It's a long day in the saddle.'</p>
      <p>Mr Hoyte, a heritage consultant, has produced around a dozen pieces of art on his bike, and believes his training as a product designer helps in the creative process of planning the routes.</p>
      <p>He added: 'I just spend a lot of time looking at maps and it's waiting for things to jump out at you.</p>
      <p>'Normally I look at maps until I see something - 'That looks a bit like a nose' - so I think 'Where can I find eyes near that? It's like looking at patterns in clouds and seeing pictures.</p>
      <p>'With these ones it's a bit more tricky because I'm trying to do something festive so it's harder, but it's the same process really.'</p>

        <figcaption>He followed it up last year with a Santa shape in Birmingham. He rode for 88 miles to make the shape, which took him 10 hours in total </figcaption>

      <p>Other routes Mr Hoyte has cycled include a Yorkshire terrier in Leeds, two elephants in Birmingham, and a flock of birds in Bristol.</p>
      <p>In 2017 he produced his first festive work by cycling a snowman in London and he followed it up last year with Santa in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>He said: 'In a sense I've made a rod for my own back in that it's become a tradition and everyone was saying 'So what's it going to be this year?'</p>
      <p>'But in the end, the reindeer turned out almost exactly as planned.</p>
      <p>'There's a little glitch in there near Shepherd's Bush where I obviously lost the GPS signal and it creates a straight line that cuts through a couple of street blocks, but that's minor,' he said.</p>
      <p>'I made a couple of mistakes but they're so small that nobody's going to notice really. I'm happy. It looks how I wanted it to look.'</p>
