      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:29:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Melanie Bonn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/melanie-bonn/</a></address>
      <p>Police have confirmed a body was found in the River Tay at Newburgh yesterday, just days after a Perth pensioner went missing.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said at 3pm yesterday: “Police Scotland can confirm that the body of a man has been recovered from the River Tay in Fife.</p>
      <p>“A body was reported to be in the water near Newburgh around midday on Monday, December 9.</p>
      <p>“Formal identification has yet to take place but the family of missing man Michael McGannon, aged 73, from the North Muirton area of Perth, has been informed.</p>
      <p>“The death is currently being treated as unexplained pending further enquiries, and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.”</p>

      <p>The news came as police officers and water rescue crews had searched for Perth pensioner, Michael McGannon.</p>
      <p>He had last been seen at his home address in Iona Court in North Muirton at 9pm Saturday, December 7, before disappearing suddenly that evening.</p>
      <p>Calmer weather conditions made yesterday’s search efforts for Michael a little easier than the day before, when SFRS searched the River Tay near Queen’s Bridge using inflatable boats in high winds and torrential rain.</p>
      <p>A helicopter had been involved over the river and search dogs had been used to look in woodland near Mr McGannon’s home.</p>

      <p>River levels still remained very high yesterday as officers were out again, hoping to find traces of the missing man.</p>
      <p>Police had made a direct request for Michael to let them know if he was somewhere safe, but to no avail.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Inspector Mark Veal said: “We are becoming increasingly concerned for Michael’s welfare.</p>
      <p>“Given his age and the adverse weather over the past 18 hours we would like to know he is okay and would urge anyone with information to contact us, or if Michael is reading this, please let us know you are safe.”</p>
      <p>At the time he went missing, Michael was believed to have been wearing a green fleece jacket and dark trousers.</p>
