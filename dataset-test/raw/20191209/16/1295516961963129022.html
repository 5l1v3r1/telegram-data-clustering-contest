      <h1>Birds of Prey Will Be Much More Than Harley Quinn's Team, Director Promises</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:12:18+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">Sundi Rose</a></address>
      <p>Although trailers, posters and even the title have suggested Harley Quinn might be the lead of the upcoming <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/birds-of-prey-film/">Birds of Prey: And The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn</a></i>, that's not the case. In fact, director Cathy Yan promised it will be more of an ensemble movie and will explore the other female characters just as carefully.</p>
      <p>During a set visit attended by <a href="https://screenrant.com/birds-of-prey-not-harley-quinn-movie/">Screen Rant</a> and other outlets, Yan was quick to clear up any misconceptions about who the movie is <i>really</i> about. "I love that. I love that it isn't really 'The Harley Quinn Movie,' it very much is broader than that, and we check in with all of these women," she explained. "It's truly an ensemble film, it's not even a team. You see them as a team right now, but we really spend time with each of these women, and they are very much the protagonists in the film. I joke that we have two villains and five protagonists. And they each really are their own... they feel like leads. And I like that. I like that story, I think it hasn't really been told in that way."</p>

      <p>Although it's narrated by Harley and the stories of the women are told through her point of view, the film promises to explore the characters Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya and Cassandra Cain in their own merit. "[Harley] doesn't necessarily make friends with the other women, but they come together, and through that they all sort of emancipate themselves throughout the film," Yan said. "And of course, a really important relationship is her relationship with little Cass, as well."</p>
      <p>Directed by Cathy Yan from a script by Christina Hodson, <i>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i> stars Margot Robbie, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Ewan McGregor, Steven Williams, Derek Wilson, Dana Lee, Francois Chau, Charlene Amoia, Chris Messina and Matthew Willig. The film is scheduled for release on Feb. 7, 2020.</p>
