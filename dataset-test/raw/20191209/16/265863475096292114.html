      <p>Someone gushed over NeNe’s new look and said: ‘Loving these bangs on you,’ and another fan agreed: ‘Wow what a voice girl!!! Loving this look too!’</p>
      <p>Another follower was not happy about so much drama on the RHOA series: ‘Stop being so damn messy !!! How old are we?’</p>
      <p>A commenter responded: ‘they’re all old. And it’s a damn reality show, peace doesn’t keep the ratings up.’</p>
      <p>Someone else also said: ‘you must not know how real-tv tactics work. These girls all get along. How convenient nene and Kim Zolciak are back to being sissy 😂’</p>
      <p>An Instagrammer exclaimed: ‘Boom!! Sick of her playing victim. Then she acts tough around the other girls but smile in your face. You were right the entire time!!’ and someone else said: ‘Lord I thought y’all had made up. Watching the show makes everyone fall out again chile 😩’</p>
