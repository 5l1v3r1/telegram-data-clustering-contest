      <h1>Equity flows in MFs dip sharply, assets rise to a record in Nov.</h1>
      <h2>With stock indices rising, investors opt for profit booking; gold ETFs see inflows</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:49:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The total assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund (MF) industry crossed a record ₹27 lakh crore in November even as flows dipped substantially compared with the previous month.</p>
      <p>According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), the total AUM of the industry was pegged at ₹27.05 lakh crore in November, marginally higher than October’s AUM of ₹26.33 lakh crore.</p>
      <p>While the total AUM rose, the net flows fell considerably, especially in the debt segment wherein it more than halved compared with October.</p>
      <p>As per AMFI data, the income/debt segment saw inflows to the tune of ₹51,427.58 crore compared with over ₹1.21 lakh crore.</p>
      <h3>Overnight funds</h3>
      <p>Within the income and debt category, overnight funds saw the maximum flows at nearly ₹21,000 crore followed by funds dedicated to banks and public sector undertakings (PSUs).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the equity segment also saw a similar drop in flows like the debt category. The category saw flows to the tune of ₹1,311.65 crore in November against ₹6,026.38 crore in October.</p>
      <p>“Goal-based, long-term SIP investments from retail investors continue to grow steadily, with SIP AUM at an all-time high at ₹3.12 lakh crore,” said N.S. Venkatesh, chief executive officer, AMFI.</p>
      <p>“While, equity net inflows have come down sharply in November, partly due to investors booking profit, the overall mutual fund industry AUM reached an all-time high of ₹27 lakh crore,” he added.</p>
      <p>Market participants attribute the drop in flows in the equity segment to profit booking on the back of the benchmark indices touching record levels.</p>
      <p>The rally also saw many of the side counters surging strongly, leading to many investors booking profit.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw renewed investor interest with the segment registering inflows of nearly ₹8 crore, following previous month’s outflows of over ₹31 crore.</p>
