      <h1>Walmart apologises for Christmas jumper of Santa doing coke</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:04:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author">Almara Abgarian</a></address>
      <p>It is universally accepted that holiday jumpers are generally quite ugly, cheeky or just a bit naughty.</p>
      <p>However, one company got it wrong when they released a jumper that appears to have a design of Father <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christmas/">Christmas</a> doing cocaine.</p>
      <p>Walmart Canada has issued an apology after being called out for selling the narcotics-inspired design on its website.</p>
      <p>The jumper shows a very jolly Santa Claus, with wide pupils, sat in front of a table with three lines of a white substance in front of him.</p>
      <p>He also seems to be holding something thin and white in his hand, which is potentially meant to resemble a straw.</p>
      <p>‘We all know how snow works,’ the product description reads.</p>
      <p>‘It’s white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America. That’s bad news for jolly old St Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole.</p>
      <p>‘That’s why Santa really likes to savour the moment when he get his hands on some quality, grade A, Colombian snow.’</p>
      <p>Walmart has announced that the item, which is sold by a third party retailer called Fun Wear, has now been removed from its Canadian website.</p>
      <p>‘These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart’s values and have no place on our website,’ the spokesperson told <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6267927/walmart-canada-christmas-sweaters-cocaine/">Global News</a>.</p>
      <p>‘We have removed these products from our marketplace.</p>
      <p>‘We apologise for any unintended offence this may have caused.’</p>
      <p>Fun Wear still has other options available on the site, including a design of <a href="https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/Men-s-Free-Santa-Ugly-Christmas-Sweater/1B9CE8D9EZ2F">Santa Claus getting his mugshot</a> at the North Pole police department.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t picked up an outfit for Christmas Jumper Day yet, here are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/06/a-bumper-round-up-of-the-best-christmas-jumpers-for-2019-11203259/">some fantastic patterns to choose from this year</a> – from David Attenborough’s face to retro classics.</p>
      <p>You can also make a statement this year, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/peta-launched-terrifying-christmas-jumper-featuring-mutilated-sheep-11091382/">PETA released a terrifying jumper that features a mutilated sheep</a>.</p>
      <p>Or just do like Scrooge and skip out altogether.</p>
