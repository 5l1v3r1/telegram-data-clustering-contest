      <h1>‘I Am Jesus Christ’ Is the Ultimate God Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:55:20+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>There have been plenty of video games based on the <a href="https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/the-craziest-bible-stories-1646669/">Bible</a>. Most of them are bad, sometimes hilariously so. Religion has inspired some of history’s greatest works of art. But so far video games have yet to receive that divine touch, from Christianity at least. It’s about time that changed.</p>
      <p>For YEARS I’ve been pitching a game where you either play as Jesus or fight Jesus. It’s such a logical endpoint for a franchise like<i> Assassin’s Creed</i> or <i>God of War</i>. But whereas AAA publishers are too cowardly and full of sin to make the ultimate god game, this weekend our salvation was revealed in the form of an indie game.</p>
      <p>The first trailer for <i>I Am Jesus Christ</i> has risen.</p>

      <p>This is apparently a real game “coming soon” to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1198970/I_Am_Jesus_Christ/">Steam</a> from publisher PlayWay S.A. and developer SimulaM. Some other games from this team include <i>Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 </i>and <i>Priest Simulator</i>. And what is Jesus if not both of those things?</p>
      <p>This absolutely wild trailer has you role-playing as Christ in first-person, sticking out your hands to heal the sick and summon fish for the hungry using your, say, miracle meter. Walk on water! Get nailed to a crucifix! Resurrect yourself three days later! The Steam screenshots also show you vanquishing <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/the-11-best-demons-to-summon-1633814/">demons</a> so here’s hoping from some <i>Dante’s Inferno</i> or <i>Doom</i>-style action for good measure.</p>
      <p>You’d figure Christmas Day would be the perfect time to release a game this blessed. But just like Christ’s second coming,<i> I Am Jesus Christ</i> has no confirmed release date. When it comes to Jesus adaptations, here’s hoping it’s more Martin Scorsese than Mel Gibson. In the meantime, why not <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/build-with-the-pope-in-the-vaticans-minecraft-server-1812373/">play <i>Minecraft</i> with the Pope</a>.</p>
