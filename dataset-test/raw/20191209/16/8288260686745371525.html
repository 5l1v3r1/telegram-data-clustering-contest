      <p>Aston Villa host Middlesbrough in an under-23 clash at the all-new <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Bodymoor Heath</a> match complex this evening.</p>
      <p>The super-new facility was officially opened on November 29 with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> smashing six past Portsmouth in the Premier League Cup.</p>
      <p>The impressive complex features one 400-seater match stand, a small press box, dugouts and a players' tunnel.</p>
      <p>There's also a cashless bar in operation featuring all of your Villa Park refreshment favourites.</p>
      <p>It's located a short drive past the main Bodymoor Heath entrance with car parking available opposite the site entrance.</p>

      <p>"It's long overdue," explained Scott Ravenhill, who has been watching the under-23s relentlessly for five years now, "a proper home for the development squads.</p>
      <p>"As a fan it feel like a proper Aston Villa experience. vs Portsmouth. Hopefully that will make it more attractive for fans and we can build a stronger support for Villa through all the age groups."</p>
      <p>The fan experience was in full flow against Pompey, with legendary Villa Park stadium announcer Dave Poulton on hand behind the microphone for pre-match build-up, goal alerts and substitutions.</p>
      <p>This reporter was also at the most-recent match at the new facility, with a hundred-or-so braving the arctic and foggy conditions in the North Warwickshire countryside.</p>
      <p>But the site gives supporters their Villa fix. What's more is Dean Smith, John Terry, Richard O'Kelly, academy supremo Mark Harrison and performance director <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-staff-premier-league-16330888">Jeremy Oliver</a> were all there watching Villa's young guns stick six past a lacklustre Portsmouth youth side.</p>
      <p>Two youngsters who have already made their first-team bows - Jacob Ramsey and Cameron Archer - scored two of the goals with Tyreik Wright, Lewis Brunt and French striker Dimitri Sea scoring.</p>

      <p>Of the young bunch, Ramsey, Archer and centre-back Mungo Bridge stood out as Mark Delaney's side played in a fluid 4-3-3 formation, much like the first-team.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere at the training ground, improvements are aplenty as owners Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris continue to plough in funds to keep Villa pushing on into a vibrant, modern-day and sustainable Premier League football club.</p>
      <p>As for this evening's Premier League 2 encounter, ex-Villa striker Rudy Gestede is set to feature for Boro on his return from a hamstring injury. Season-ticket holders, meanwhile, can go free but tickets must be registered in advance. Adults are priced at £4, concessions £1.</p>
      <p>As for Villa, the club announced that all but one of the under-23s fixtures will now be played at Bodymoor Heath. The game against West Ham United on April 6, 2020, will be the only fixture at Villa Park.</p>
