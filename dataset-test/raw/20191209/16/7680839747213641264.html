        <li>Apple’s iPhones are probably the most supported smartphones out there in terms of accessories, but the glut of peripheral gadgets makes it tough to sort out the wheat from the chaff.</li>
        <li>Luckily for you, we’ve found a bunch of iPhone accessories that any iPhone user would love to receive as a holiday gift.</li>
        <li>Looking for holiday gifts in general? Read over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-gift-guide">all our holiday gift guides on Insider Picks</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of the great things about the iPhone is that, since it’s been a staple smartphone for so long, there is a veritable ton of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-iphone-accessories">iPhone accessories</a> for all sorts of budgets. Naturally, you have your high-end wireless headphones, speakers and even charging cases, but there are also straight cases, long-lasting Lightning cables and phone grips for as low as $10.</p>
      <p>As Insider Picks’ badge-wearing tech nerds and iPhone stans, we’ve tried out tons of accessories over the years, and gifted many of these accessories to friends and family as well – all of which have been received with glee and inevitable phone calls asking for tech support.</p>
      <p>The majority of these gifts are available with “free” two-day shipping if you subscribe to <a href="https://amzn.to/2URNDHW">Amazon Prime</a>, so they’ll arrive ready to wrap for Christmas if you act quickly.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It seems like iPhones get bigger every year, so why not buy a nice sturdy PopSocket grip and save your loved one the pinky strain? These handy grips stick on the back of most iPhone cases with ease and pop out twice to provide excellent grip. Your giftee can even use them to prop up their phone so it stands alone as they watch videos.</p>
      <p>PopSocket grips come in more patterns, colors, and styles than I can count, so you’ll be sure to find one that matches the personality of your loved one. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-iphone-accessories">I personally love my PopSocket grip so much</a> that I can’t imagine life without it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There are two things wrong with the lightning cable Apple includes in the box with each new iPhone: The cable is too short and it’s too weak. Native Union’s Night Cable solves both those problems with a 10-foot-long durable cable that can easily reach to charge your phone.</p>
      <p>It also has a handy knotted weight on it that you can move up and down the cable to ensure that your iPhone stays on the table while it charges without falling or moving. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-lightning-cable-iphone">It’s our favorite long iPhone cable</a>.</p>

      <p>Marshall is known for its classic rock-n-roll aesthetic, and its Kilburn II Bluetooth Speaker is an icon in its own right. This speaker has the classic Marshall look and appears to be an amp at first glance. It’s actually a powerful Bluetooth speaker with a massive battery inside that can last through about 20 hours of playback. I use this speaker at home often, and I love it – your iPhone-addicted giftee will, too.</p>

      <p>The lamp has five color temperature modes and seven brightness levels, so you can adjust it to suit your needs. The lamp’s head tilts up to 135 degrees and rotates up to 180 degrees, plus, the arm can be tilted up to 150 degrees and swivels 90 degrees, which is to say, this lamp will illuminate anything you want in just about any direction while charging your phone.</p>
