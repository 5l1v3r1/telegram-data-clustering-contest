      <p>According to her biography on the <a href="https://www.missuniverse.com/contestant/1000734#contestant.news">pageant website</a>, Tunzi hails from Tsolo, South Africa and is "a passionate activist and engaged in the fight against gender based violence."</p>
      <p>She also devoted her social media campaign to "changing the narrative around gender stereotypes" and worked to promote natural beauty as well as women loving themselves.</p>
      <p>"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me with my kind of skin and my kind of hair was never considered to be beautiful. And I think it's time that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face and see theirs reflected in mine," she said during the contest.</p>
      <p>After the show, Tunzi echoed that statement on Twitter saying, "Tonight a door was opened and I could not be more grateful to have been the one to have walked through it."</p>

      <p>Tunzi beat out nearly 90 other contestants for the crown. The two runners-up were Miss Mexico and Miss Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>South Africa was also represented in 2017 when Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters won.</p>
      <p>She congratulated Tunzi, saying, "What a woman you are!" and captioned one of her tweets, "Sisterhood!"</p>

      <p>Even Steve Harvey appeared to be enamored with Tunzi, asking her to sign his jacket, something he said he's never asked a contestant to do before.</p>
