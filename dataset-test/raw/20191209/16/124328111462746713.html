      <p>A student was left in 'excruciating pain' after he was hit on the head with a police baton during a protest, a hearing was told.</p>
      <p>Alfie Meadows, 29, said he saw an officer 'thrashing around' with the weapon before he was struck exactly nine years ago, when he suffered a head injury requiring emergency surgery.</p>
      <p>Then studying philosophy at Middlesex University, he was among more than 10,000 people demonstrating against student fees in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/london/index.html"><b>London</b></a> on December 9, 2010.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Mark Alston is facing a misconduct hearing in central London accused of using unreasonable force.</p>
      <p>He was a Pc when he was deployed to police the protest, which saw violent clashes in and around Parliament Square.</p>
      <p>Video footage played at the hearing is said to capture the moment Dc Alston raised his weapon in a 'violent, uncontrolled and dangerous manner' before striking Mr Meadows.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence, Mr Meadows, who is studying for a master's degree in philosophy, said protesters used fencing to push back against officers but denied he had been aggressive in any way to police before he was hit.</p>
      <p>'The officer was right in front of me and thrashing around with his baton,' he said.</p>
      <p>'He hit the fence away with his baton. The fence went off to his right and he was swinging his baton from high to low above his head.</p>
      <p>'He was right in front of me thrashing his baton around and swinging his baton towards me.'</p>

      <p>Mr Meadows continued: 'The baton swung from high to low. It was coming straight towards my head.</p>
      <p>'I instinctively span around because I thought I was about to be hit by the baton and as soon as I spun around I was struck by the baton.</p>
      <p>'I was struck on the top right of my head and it was incredibly hard and painful. I saw flashing lights and it was the most painful thing I have ever experienced.'</p>
      <p>He added: 'I put my hand to my head. I was in excruciating pain.'</p>
      <p>Mr Meadows told a three-person panel he felt 'confused and groggy' and his condition deteriorated when he was eventually taken to hospital by ambulance.</p>

      <p>He needed more than 100 staples in his head and was left with a large scar, but was charged with causing violent disorder and taken to court where he was cleared by a jury in 2013.</p>
      <p>A probe by the police watchdog, now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), found Dc Alston had a case to answer for gross misconduct, but City of London police rejected the recommendation.</p>
      <p>The force then failed in a court bid to challenge the IOPC's direction that he should face a full hearing.</p>
      <p>Dc Alston is said to have wielded his 'baton in a violent, uncontrolled and dangerous manner when he used it to deliver a number of downward strikes at head height towards a group of demonstrators'.</p>
      <p>The officer is also accused of using unreasonable force when he 'hit Alfie Meadows on the head, causing a serious head injury'.</p>
      <p>A response to the allegations submitted on Dc Alston's behalf said: 'The officer accepts he wielded his baton, but denies that it was in a violent, uncontrolled and dangerous manner or was in any way disproportionate in light of the circumstances in which he was operating.</p>
      <p>'The officer denies hitting Mr Meadows, or anyone, on the head with it.'</p>
      <p>The case continues. </p>
