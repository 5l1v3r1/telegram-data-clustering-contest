      <p>SEATTLE - Washington state authorities say 4-year-old twins freed themselves from their car seats and climbed an embankment seeking help following a car crash that killed their father.</p>
      <p>KING-TV reported 47-year-old Corey Simmons of Langley died when the vehicle with his daughters in the backseat crashed on Whidbey Island around 6 p.m. Friday.</p>
      <p>Family members say the girls climbed about 200 feet (61 metres) up to the road after the accident 34 miles (55 kilometres) north of Seattle.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Simmons was not wearing a seatbelt when the car crashed into trees and went down the embankment.</p>
      <p>Police say the girls were transported to a hospital with minor injuries after an unidentified woman passing in her car went back to help and called 911.</p>
