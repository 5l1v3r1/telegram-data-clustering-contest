        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a> have raised eyebrows with their unique interior design choices in the past, but fans drew the line this month over their cheerless Christmas decorations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, sources say Kim refuses to add a bit more festive cheer to the place just because fans aren’t loving it.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star gave her Instagram followers a tour of her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/06/kim-kardashian-shuns-tinsel-fairy-lights-cotton-wool-christmas-trees-baffled-11281386/">sparse corridors which are lined with cotton wool trees</a> and not much else.</p>
      <p>And by not much else, we mean no tinsel or baubles. But, according to insiders, the cotton wool trees are here to stay.</p>
      <p>‘Kim is extremely sensitive and she is not a fan of people calling out their feelings about her design or fashion missteps on social media, however, that doesn’t mean she will change anything or do anything differently,’ a <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/12/08/kim-kardashian-not-changing-christmas-decor-details/">source told Hollywood Life.</a></p>
      <p>‘She likes it and thinks it looks cute as it is.’</p>
      <p>If the kids like it, then who are we to judge?</p>

      <p>Sharing her excitement about the decorations, Kim said in her Instagram video on 5 December: ‘I love these. They’re so whimsical, like Whoville, but all white.’</p>
      <p>It turns out the cotton wool Christmas trees were recycled from her Christmas Eve party last year, which was hosted at her and Kanye’s pad for the first time after taking over from her mum Kris Jenner’s annual tradition.</p>
      <p>Kim’s interior design choices have certainly been questionable in recent years.</p>
      <p>Since moving into the $60 million (£46 million) mansion, Kim and Kanye have baffled fans with minimal furniture and mausoleum feel of the property which lacks bold colours – most of the rooms are white, beige and grey.</p>
      <p>Even the bedrooms belonging to their children North, six, Saint, four, Chicago, one and five-month-old Psalm, lack the vibrancy of most playrooms.</p>
      <p>Fans were also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/18/kim-kardashian-explains-going-sinks-fans-demand-answers-9242851/">super confused by the sinks in Kim’s kitchen</a>, which appeared to be a completely flat surface until it was revealed exactly how the modern feature works.</p>
