      <p>It is claimed eight different ITV presenters have broken their silence regarding Phillip's attitude. The show's Friday presenter Ruth, 59, is said to have made an official complaint. </p>
      <p>A report stated the situation behind the scenes at This Morning had become 'toxic' in recent months, with employees too scared to speak out publicly for fear of backlash. </p>
      <p>An ITV source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/"><b>The Sun</b></a>: 'For so long people have been silenced because they are scared for their job. If they speak out publicly about the atmosphere they fear there could be repercussions.'</p>

      <h3>Body language expert on Holly and Phil's This Morning appearance amid feud claims</h3>
      <p>MailOnline's Judi James says: </p>
      <p>'<i>Both Holly and Phil are veteran TV presenters and its hugely unlikely they would ever allow any negative inner feelings or relationships show on screen. If they did, I would expect over-congruent displays like stretched, rigid smiles and intensified laughing/touching displays to try to prove and rumours about fall-outs wrong.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>'If there is any change in their dynamic this morning it appears that Holly might be taking a less compliant and more dominant role, initiating a lot of the speaking and even raising one hand in the outdoor VT to signal that she intended to make the next comments. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>'I hate the word ‘bubbly’ but that has been word commonly used to describe her presenting style, but today she appeared adopt rather more serious and ‘adult’ demeanor on screen. Outside the building she had her coat thrown over her shoulders like a cape but her rather self-diminished poses were probably just down to the fact that it was a very chilly morning.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>'Back in the studio she sat confidently, looking straight at camera and there did seem to be a bit less of the tie-signs you normally get from the couple when they’re being ‘fun’ together, however they always do vary their body language behaviour together according to the subject of their interviews. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>'If there was any tension from Holly it might have come from the way she was picking at the sleeve of her jumper in one scene then fidgeting with her cue card in another and picking at her little finger in a third. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>'Even so, small self-comfort gestures like this would be normal from anyone working under the pressure of a daily live show like this. One thing both Holly and Phil excel at is making a very difficult job look very easy.'</i>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>An insider close to Holly added to the paper: 'It’s true there have been some issues. They’re like brothers and sisters - they have ups and downs but love each other.'</p>
      <p>Hitting back at the reports, a spokesperson for ITV said: 'It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.' </p>
      <p>'Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise.</p>
      <p>'Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike.'</p>

      <p>Martin Frizell, Editor of This Morning explained: 'I spend hundreds of days a year in their company and what you see is what you get, a genuine friendship from a couple who are both spontaneously funny and professional.</p>
      <p>'We have the smartest viewers watching telly and believe me they would be the first to notice any issues - they haven’t because there are none.'</p>
      <p>The Mail on Sunday revealed relations on set are said to be so bad, Ruth and husband Eamonn snubbed the show’s Christmas party to avoid Phillip, after a series of behind-the-scenes rows, with the silver-maned ITV stalwart being described as 'rude’.</p>
      <p>Ruth and Eamonn host the Friday episode of This Morning and sit in for other presenters’ holidays, but were surprisingly absent last week from the no-expense-spared dinner at a West London restaurant where 23 of their colleagues enjoyed a four-course meal and champagne to celebrate the holiday season.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Missing: Holly shared a snap form the This Morning Christmas party on Instagram in which regular Friday hosts Ruth and Eamonn were nowhere to be seen</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The tension between Ruth and Phillip stems from April when they spoke over each other while she was doing a live preview of Loose Women, which she also hosts. </p>
      <p>As he cut her off abruptly, saying: ‘We’re a bit tight for time at this end,’ she retorted: ‘I only had about two more words to say, don’t worry.’ </p>
      <p>Since then, it seems relations between Phillip, Ruth and a protective Eamonn have only deteriorated.</p>
      <p>The rift is causing anxiety at YMU, the agency formerly known as James Grant, which represents all four.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The show must go on: The pair continued to adhere to their hosting duties despite the feud rumours </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It is also understood that Phillip is playing down Ruth’s grievance over being cut off by insisting it was the fault of the show’s production team. </p>
      <p>A source revealed: ‘There are an increasing number of presenters who say that when the cameras aren’t running the atmosphere is toxic.</p>
      <p>‘Phillip is a man with high standards, he has survived a long time in the TV world. There has been an almighty clash. There is currently one household name on ITV daytime who refers to him as “the c***”.’</p>
      <p>Phillip, who joined This Morning in 2002, is also said to be envious that Eamonn, 60, was given an OBE last year for services to broadcasting. </p>

        <figcaption>Speaking out: Earlier on Monday, Amanda Holden weighed into the latest controversy surrounding Phillip by praising his This Morning co-hosts for standing up for themselves</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Despite the controversy, Phillip has taken to Twitter to thank fans for voting for This Morning to win an I Talk Telly award - seemingly ignoring the recent rumours about him causing a 'toxic' atmosphere on set.</p>
      <p>The presenter posted the video with the simple caption 'Thank You', in which he gushes about his and Willoughby's fans, accepting the award for the fifth consecutive year. </p>
      <p>MailOnline contacted a representative for further comment at the time of publication.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, Amanda Holden weighed into the latest controversy surrounding Phillip by praising his This Morning co-hosts for standing up for themselves amid a slew of alleged complaints regarding his behaviour.</p>

        <figcaption>Claims: Phillip is reported to have been furious at Holly (pictured with Declan Donnelly) for landing a presenting role on I’m A Celeb while Ant McPartlin recovered from alcohol issues</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The presenter, 48, previously hit out at Phillip over claims he blocked her from filling in for regular co-host <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/holly-willoughby/index.html"><b>Holly </b></a>while she spent three weeks in Australia presenting <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/index.html"><b>I'm A Celebrity</b></a>... Get Me Out Of Here! </p>
      <p>Addressing the latest claims on her Heart Radio show, Holden insisted she had moved on from her own spat with Phil, but conceded it may well have lit a fuse.  </p>
      <p>'Listen, I’ve drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip,' she told fellow presenter Jamie Theakston. </p>
      <p>'I’m just going to say I really admire anyone that’s going to stick up for themselves because it’s not an easy thing to do. </p>
      <p> 'There’s a tin opener and a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener. That’s all I’m saying.'</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Speaking to The Sun, insiders previously revealed that Holden believed he scuppered her chances of filling in on This Morning during her absence in November and December 2018.  </p>
      <p>It's understood that she headed to the top by lobbying ITV executives over the animosity after he allegedly pushed for former Saturdays star Rochelle Humes to take the job.</p>
      <p>A former daytime TV executive told the publication: 'Phillip actively campaigned for Rochelle Humes to get the job despite Amanda being more experienced - and having been told privately she’d got the gig.' </p>
      <p>And addressing the host on Heart Radio in June, Amanda alluded to a rift when revealing the three things things she wouldn't like to find in her home, flippantly telling fans: 'Spiders, flies and Phillip Schofield.’ </p>
