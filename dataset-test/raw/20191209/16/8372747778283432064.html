      <p>SAVANNAH, Ga. – A Georgia reporter was groped on live television while reporting on a running event on Saturday.</p>
      <p>At the time of the incident, Alexandrea Bozarjian was covering the annual Enmarket Savannah Bridge Run, during which runners make their way across the Talmadge Bridge.</p>
      <p>In a video posted to social media, several runners are seen posturing for the camera, some getting so close that Bozarjian looked visually uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>One man ended up taking things too far, smacking the reporter’s backside while jogging past her. Immediately afterwards, Bozarjian appears to take a minute to collect herself and then continues her report.</p>
      <p>Later on Twitter, Bozarjian called out the groper, saying “To the man who smacked my butt on live TV this morning: You violated, objectified, and embarrassed me. No woman should EVER have to put up with this at work or anywhere!! Do better.”</p>

      <p>Many have chimed in online, condemning the man’s actions, including the <a href="https://twitter.com/RobWells1/status/1203410742273331200?s=20">director of the Savannah Sports Council,</a> who said “This will not be tolerated at our events. Glad we have race bibs and photos for easy identification.”</p>
      <p>The Savannah Sports Council has said the man is now banned from participating in its races, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-reporter-groped-live-television-participant-running-event-n1097771">according to NBC News.</a></p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Savannah Police Department told NBC News that officers have been in touch with Bozarjian and they’re discussing how to move forward with the case.</p>
