      <p>Crime Stoppers could use your help solving a recent aggravated robbery.</p>
      <p>The crime occurred on Wednesday, October 30 at Abels General Store 2, located at 1335 Central Freeway.</p>
      <p>At around 4:20 pm, a tall, black male wearing an orange/red colored beanie and sunglasses with brown tint lenses entered the store. The suspect then jabbed a box cutter at the clerk several times, demanding money. The man fled the scene after the clerk gave him money from the register.</p>
      <p>If you have any information on this or any other felony crime, call Crime Stoppers twenty-four hours a day at (940)322-9888, or if youâ€™re calling long distance, call (800)322-9888. You never have to give your name, and if your information leads to the arrest and board approval, you could earn up to $1,000.</p>
