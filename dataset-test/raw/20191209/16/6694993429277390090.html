      <h1>Manchester United fans identify full strength team when everyone's fit</h1>
      <h2>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could soon have a dilemma when Paul Pogba returns from injury and other Man Utd players are available.</h2>

      <p>Manchester United fans believe Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is close to discovering his first choice team after two recent victories.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> have been plagued by inconsistent form for much of the campaign, but wins over Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City in the past week have provided a timely boost for Solskjaer and his squad.</p>
      <p>And it seems many supporters think that the return of <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-latest-news-pogba-17386250">Paul Pogba from injury</a> could give United yet another boost.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has been missing since September 30th with an ankle injury. And although United have coped well — particularly the midfield duo of Scott McTominay and Fred — many fans think Pogba should return in the No.10 role.</p>
      <p>Some fans also want to see youngster Brandon Williams reinstated at left-back, despite positive displays from Luke Shaw against City and Ashley Young versus Spurs. Shaw appears to be the current first choice on the left of defence.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's dilemma will be whether to bring back Pogba into a deeper midfield position and changed United's shape from the 4-2-3-1 that has been effective or late. Axel Tuanzebe and Williams are also pushing for regular inclusion, as is Mason Greenwood who started against Tottenham in Anthony Martial's absence.</p>
      <p>As well as Pogba, United's other current injury worries are over Diogo Dalot, Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Marcos Rojo, though none would break into the strongest XI as things stand.</p>
      <p>Here's the team that some fans want to see picked by Solskjaer on a regular basis — when all players are fit.</p>
