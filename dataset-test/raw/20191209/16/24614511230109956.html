      <p><b>Ford</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/f-stock-quote/"><b><u>F</u></b></a>) stock has an illusory high dividend yield. The company <i>still</i> can’t afford the quarterly 15 cent payment. So, investors shouldn’t be fooled by the 6.7% yield.</p>

      <p>This isn’t my fist time highlighting the flaws of Ford’s dividend. Since I last <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/09/can-ford-stock-really-afford-its-dividend/">wrote about the company Sept. 12</a>, F stock has fallen 3.7% from $9.41 to $9.06 per share.</p>
      <p>That article compared Ford’s second-quarter 2019 adjusted free cash flow with its dividend payments. We can now do the same here with Ford’s Q3 results.</p>
      <h3>The Cost of Ford’s Dividend</h3>
      <p>Ford’s Q3 adjusted free cash flow was flat compared with Q2 at just $200 million. Furthermore, its ability to finance the quarterly dividend worsened.</p>

      <p>The Ford dividend cost $800 million in Q3. This means its $200 million in adjusted FCF cash flow is not enough to cover those payments.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/01/16/ford-details-commitment-to-global-redesign.html">global redesign</a> and the company’s pension contributions cost another $500 million. Without the increase in debt, the total costs would have been $1.3 billion this past quarter. The $200 million in adjusted FCF can’t come close to financing these recurring expenses.</p>
      <p>On top of this, in Q2, as you can see in my previous article, the cash flow deficit from adjusted FCF has increased. The dividend only cost $600 million in Q2. However, the total deficit was $1 billion, slightly higher than this quarter’s $900 million.</p>
      <h3>Ford’s Cash Net of Debt Is Faltering</h3>
      <p>The proof is in the pudding. The fact that Ford can’t afford its dividend can be seen in its falling cash balance, net of total debt.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The cash balance, net of debt, has fallen from $8.9 billion to $7.5 billion by the end of Q3. This is a drain of $1.4 billion in just three quarters. The cash drain in the last two quarters has been $1.9 billion.</p>
      <p>So the question remains, can Ford really afford its dividend? In my September article, I pointed out that Ford has already cut out its special dividend.</p>
      <p>I am not sure Ford really sees things this way yet. Management has been telling analysts that the adjusted FCF has been increasing from losses last year.</p>
      <p>That is true, but in Q3 the adjusted FCF figure stayed at $200 million, flat with Q2. That is not growth. And that level of adjusted FCF still can’t cover the dividend, the global redesign and the pension payments.</p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line on Ford Stock</h3>
      <p>In its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/857684434/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/Ford-3Q2019-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf">Q3 earnings release</a> on Oct. 23, Ford lowered its guidance for its full-year earnings. This effectively means that Ford expects $500 million lower earnings before interest and taxes. That will feed directly into adjusted FCF by at least the same amount.</p>
      <p>So I suspect that the after-dividend cost will bring a higher deficit. It is highly likely that Q4 adjusted FCF could turn negative. The deficit after the dividend payment could be as much as $1.4 billion.</p>
      <p>This will draw down the company’s net cash balance further. That will not sit well with investors. For example, what if signs of a recession start to emerge? That will really draw down cash. Investors will begin to realize that the dividend is unaffordable at these levels.</p>
      <p>Now, to Ford’s credit, it has not cut the dividend in a long time. And it may not yet do so unless there is a recession coming. But the fears of a dividend cut will continue to plague Ford stock.</p>
      <p>For that reason, I do not see much upside. Holders of Ford stock should probably not sell yet. But I would be very wary of taking a new position just because the dividend yield looks enticing. It may turn out to be an illusory high dividend yield.</p>
