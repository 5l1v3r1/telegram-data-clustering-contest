      <h1>You can get a Lego replica of your house but it doesn't come cheap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:16:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author">Faima Bakar</a></address>
      <p>It’s a truth universally known that Lego is not just for kids.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen the colourful bricks in many forms, whether <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/31/the-bugatti-thats-made-of-lego-is-cruising-around-london-8092342/">a sports car</a> or a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/01/couple-build-an-8ft-advent-calendar-made-with-450000-lego-bricks-8198024/">giant advent calendar</a> built by fanatics.</p>
      <p>And now you can enjoy the stuff in the shape of your home. One woman who specialises in creating replicas of where you live</p>
      <p>Designer Shari Austrian is selling the miniature houses over on Etsy where’s she got some seriously good reviews.</p>
      <p>Founder of her business, aptly named <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/LittleBrickLane?zanpid=10723_1575903525_03ab5e1e98a7580a87654792d64fc982&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=affiliate_window&amp;utm_campaign=eu_buyer&amp;utm_content=414457&amp;utm_term=79713&amp;awc=10723_1575903525_03ab5e1e98a7580a87654792d64fc982">Little Brick Lane</a>, Shari offers miniature homes, complete with an interior to match your dwelling.</p>
      <p>But her designs are pretty expensive. The mum-of-two calculates the price by charging $1.25 (95p) per square foot (roughly 34 centimetres) of your home.</p>
      <p>So a home that’s 2,000sf will cost $2,500 (£1,901). That might sound like she’s making serious bucks but when you consider how many Lego bricks are needed, plus the number of hours required, it all adds up.</p>
      <p>Shari pays ten cents apiece and uses tens of thousands of pieces for each model plus extra resources needed.</p>
      <p>Some of the higher-end homes can cost up to £3000 (with free UK delivery) while those at the cheaper end are up for grabs at £700.</p>

      <p>The idea to make a house out of Lego came to Shari after watching her twins play with the bricks.</p>
      <p>Though she started recreationally, when she shared the results of her work, Shari decided to make a business out of it after being encouraged by loved ones.</p>

      <p>Shari constructs the houses from photographs and the architectural plans. Each model can take somewhere between eight to 12 weeks</p>
      <p>She’s a bit of a perfectionist and likes to add as much detail as possible.</p>
      <p>‘I have always adored, collected and created all sorts of miniatures — they’re just so cute. From the time I was a little girl, I was building mini fruits, animals, and homes out of Play-Doh and Lego,’ Shari<a href="https://www.today.com/home/one-woman-will-build-exact-lego-replica-your-home-t121701"> told Today</a>.</p>

      <p>‘I like working with Lego both for the complexity and simplicity.</p>
      <p>‘I’m a perfectionist just as much as I’m an artist and I value the clean lines, precision and interlocking strength of the bricks.’</p>

      <p>Londoners, this might be your only chance to own your own home.</p>
