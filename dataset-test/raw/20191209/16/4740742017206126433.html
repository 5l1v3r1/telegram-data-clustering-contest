      <h2>A disappointing weekend for the Flyers, who couldn't replicate their recent cup form</h2>

      <p>Bristol Flyers suffered back-to-back defeats against Sheffield Sharks and Surrey Scorchers in the opening weekend of the BBL regular season.</p>
      <p>The Flyers were unable to recreate their recent Cup quarter-final performance against the Sharks on Friday night, going down 71-85, despite a 21 point performance from Fred Thomas.</p>
      <p>In a complete role reversal from the previous weekend, Sheffield sank 45% of their shots from behind the three point line and were led by Nick Lewis, who tallied 20 points and weight rebounds, whilst Mackey McKnight had 19 points on a very efficient 7-8 from the field.</p>
      <p>The Flyers hit the road less than 24 hours later, where they led by double-figures at half-time against the Scorchers, before the hosts made four threes in a row in the fourth to hand Bristol a 93-87 defeat.</p>

      <p>Gentrey Thomas netted 10 of a game-high 25 points in an evenly-matched first quarter, to edge Bristol ahead by with a one point after the first ten minutes.</p>
      <p>The Flyers went on a 15-0 run in the second, whilst holding Surrey scoreless for four straight minutes, giving Coach Kapoulas’ side their biggest lead of the game at 12.</p>
      <p>But their poor free throw percentage haunted them, with the team making just 50% from the line to leave the door open for a Scorchers comeback.</p>
      <p>A 15-2 run for the hosts followed and Surrey briefly took the lead before Chris Taylor beat the clock to give Flyers a one-point lead heading into the fourth.</p>
      <p>A driving lay-up from Gentrey Thomas set up a tense finish, with the game tied at 87 points apiece in the last 30 seconds.</p>
      <p>But a jump ball saw the Flyers turnover possession, allowing Surrey to ice the game from the foul line.</p>

      <h3>What Andreas Kapoulas said</h3>
      <p>“It’s a disappointing weekend for sure. We’re all disappointed - it’s the not the way we wanted to start the regular season.</p>
      <p>"We knew that Sheffield were going to come into the game on Friday with a chip on their shoulder and they played a good defensive game.</p>
      <p>"We played a decent first half against Surrey on Saturday and we secured a double digit lead heading into half-time. But they had 25 in the third and the 30 points in the fourth and we ended up paying the price.</p>

      <p>"It’s back to the drawing board, we have a BBL Cup semi-final on Friday so we need to prepare for that"</p>
      <h3>Up next</h3>
      <p>It’s another doubleheader for the Flyers this weekend, with the team traveling to London City Royals in the first leg of the BBL Cup semi-final on Friday night, before hosting Worcester Wolves in the league on Saturday, December 14th at the SGS College Arena (7.30pm tip-off).</p>
