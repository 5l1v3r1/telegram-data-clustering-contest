      <h1>Paul Finebaum Thinks Nick Saban “Hates” Ole Miss Hiring Lane Kiffin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:21:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Ole Miss’ hiring of Lane Kiffin has shaken up the college football world over the past few days. Kiffin adds a new level of excitement to the University of Mississippi. Many believe he’s exactly what the school needs to lead the football team to greatness.</p>
      <p>One major obstacle will stand in Kiffin’s way every year though – his former boss, Alabama head coach Nick Saban. The two had plenty of heated arguments during Kiffin’s time with the Crimson Tide. It got to the point where Saban had to part ways with the offensive genius ahead of the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>SEC Network’s Paul Finebaum believes that hatred may still exist. That animosity could play a major role in enlivening the Alabama-Ole Miss rivalry.</p>
      <p>Finebaum believes Saban “hates” the fact Kiffin is the Rebels’ new head coach.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think he [Saban] hates it,” Finebaum said on WJOX Radio, via <a href="https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/alabama-football/paul-finebaum-nick-saban-lane-kiffin-hire-2019/">Saturday Down South</a>. “Because he knows Lane Kiffin, and Lane Kiffin is one of the few coaches he could not control. … Getting rid of Lane Kiffin cost Nick Saban a national championship, but it just shows you how sick of Lane Kiffin Nick Saban was that he was willing to risk that a couple years ago.”</blockquote>
      <p>Looks like this Saban-Kiffin feud is just getting started.</p>
      <p>The two head coaches won’t go head to head on the football field until October of 2020. But you better believe Saban and Kiffin are already looking forward to it.</p>
