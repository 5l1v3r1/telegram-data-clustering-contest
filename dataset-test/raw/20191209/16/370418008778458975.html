      <p>Ahead of their first-ever live album release this Friday (December 13), <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/stone-sour/">Stone Sour</a> have dropped a video for their track Whiplash Pants.</p>
      <p>The upcoming 16-track live record – Hello, You Bastards: Live In Reno – spans Stone Sour’s back catalogue, featuring everything from Bother to Reborn to Taipei Person / Allah Tea.</p>
      <p>“This is the Reno show in its entirety, just how it went down on October 5, 2018,” says guitarist Josh Rand. “We’re extremely proud of the fact that it’s 100 per cent live with absolutely no overdubs! It’s not perfect but neither are we. I hope you enjoy this as much as we did playing it.”</p>

      <p>Last week it was revealed that Josh and the band didn’t even know their live show was even being recorded.</p>
      <p>“The equipment came in a couple of days early and our tour manager/front of house guy ended up hooking it up just to test run it at the Reno show. He didn’t tell any of us and he recorded the show,” <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/stone-sour-didnt-know-they-were-being-recorded-for-live-album/">Josh told the MetalSucks Podcast</a>.</p>
      <p>“The next day he says, ‘Hey, guys. I recorded last night’s show. Check it out.’ We listened to it and we were all pretty stoked with the performance.”</p>
