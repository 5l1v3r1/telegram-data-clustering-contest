        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Controversial writer and feminist Taslima Nasreen, who was expelled from Bangladesh for taking on “fundamentalist Islam” through her writings, is currently living in exile in India.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taslima Nasreen, while referring to a dance performance by Bollywood duo<a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20191130/1077441813.html"> Salman Khan</a> and Actress <a href="http://sputniknews.com/society/20191023/1077118517.html">Katrina Kaif</a> in Bangladesh, took a jibe at “conservatives” in her home country.</p>
      <p>She said the Bollywood duo and half-naked girls were dancing “erotic” numbers, witnessed by the Muslim orthodoxy – whom she referred to as Hijabi (head-scarfed women), Burqua wali (veiled women) and bearded Mullahs (Islamic scholars)</p>
      <blockquote>“They love all non-Islamic things as long as it comes from other countries,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>Both Salman and Katrina were in <a href="http://sputniknews.com/world/20191206/1077504409.html">Bangladesh</a> to perform at the inauguration ceremony of Bangladesh's Premier League (BBPL) - a professional cricket encounter.</p>

      <p>Singing and dancing has often been referred to as haram (forbidden) in Islamic religion. However, the religion has two sides to it. While the orthodox clergy condemns such performing arts, another segment called the Sufis are the most dedicated dancers in the Muslim world, highlighting it as a way to grow closer to Allah, the Muslim God. </p>
      <p>Nasreen has been a vocal critique of orthodox Islam. Her book ‘Lajja’ (Shame), in which she shared her views on Islam, sparked a furore across Bangladesh. In 2015, the award-winning writer received threats from Al Qaeda-linked extremists, media reports said.</p>
      <p>Since then, the author has been living in exile in India, and some other countries. Indian Home Ministry in July 2019, extended the author’s residence permit for yet another year until July 2020.</p>
