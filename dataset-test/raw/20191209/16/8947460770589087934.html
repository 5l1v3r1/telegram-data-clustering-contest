      <h1>The BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe is the Best Used Bimmer you can buy</h1>

      <p>Have a little BMW<a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/10/28/bmwblog-podcast-episode-3-horatiu-joins-me-to-talk-m3-leak-m8-and-8-series-gran-coupe/"> 8 Series Gran Coupe</a> fever? That’s okay. Us too. It’s a wonderful car that drives as sensationally as it looks. The only downside is that it’s expensive, with even just the BMW 840i starting at $84,900. That’s a hefty sum for a car with just six cylinders and 340 hp. However, if you want something almost as good looking and very similar in style, but for a lot less green, you can check out the used market for a BMW <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/06/18/photo-comparison-bmw-8-series-gran-coupe-vs-bmw-6-series-gran-coupe/">6 Series</a> Gran Coupe.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t take more than just a quick glance at 6 Series Gran Coupe listings to realize how good of a deal it is. Regardless of model or spec, the 6er GC can be had for seriously cheap prices, especially considering the sorts of price tags it wore when new.</p>

      <p>Just a quick search on<a href="https://www.cars.com/for-sale/searchresults.action/?dealerType=all&amp;mdId=48064%2C49763%2C57269%2C52547&amp;mkId=20005&amp;page=1&amp;perPage=20&amp;prMx=50000&amp;rd=100&amp;searchSource=SORT&amp;sort=price-highest&amp;stkTypId=28881&amp;zc=08753"> Cars.com</a>, I was able to come up with 82 listings within 100 miles of my home under $50,000. Now, you might say that $50,000 isn’t exactly cheap and you’d be right. However, included in that search are BMW <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2018/03/28/2018-nyias-bmw-m6-gran-coupe-in-british-racing-green/">M6 Gran Coupes</a> and even one ultra-rare <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2016/12/07/video-bmw-m6-gran-coupe-vs-alpina-b6-gran-coupe-best/">ALPINA B6 Gran Coupe</a>. The latter of which is a 2015 model with just over 29,000 miles on the odometer and a price tag just under $50k. That was a six-figure car, uber-luxurious performance machine five years ago (it’s basically 2020, now) and now it can be had for less than the starting price of a four-cylinder BMW 530i.</p>
      <p>My search radius is small and there are still a few M6s in that list, along with a ton of 650i and 640i models. The latter two can get really cheap, we’re talking under $40,000 and $30,000, respectively. To be honest, I think the 640i is the sweetest deal for the 6 Series Gran Coupe at the moment. You can get ones with decent miles on them for about $30,000 and you still get the stunning looks, brilliant luxury and superb driving experience. For comparison’s sake, a bone-standard 2019/2020 BMW 330i costs $40,750. While I love the new G20 3 Series, there’s not a chance I’d choose one over a 6 Series Gran Coupe.</p>

      <p>Will maintenance and expenses be a bit more of an issue on an older 6 Series Gran Coupe versus a brand-new Bimmer? Of course, these cars are almost all out of warranty and they used to be very expensive vehicles. So parts and maintenance are going to be expensive in the long run. However, I’d reckon that it’s worth it because the 6er GC is more special and more enjoyable to own, while also having the lower overall sticker price. Maintenance and parts, even when expensive, are still not bad when you get the car at the right price. Especially if you can wrench some yourself.</p>
      <p>So if you’re looking for a used BMW at the moment, take a good long look at the 6 Series Gran Coupe. When it was new, it was the coolest Bavarian on sale. Now that it’s a bit older (and only just a bit older), it’s shockingly affordable.</p>
