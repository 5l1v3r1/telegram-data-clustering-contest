      <p>Russian Foreign Minister<a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/russian-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov-to-visit-washington-us-confirms-267075"> Sergei Lavrov</a> will meet US President <a href="https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/global-stocks-rattled-after-donald-trump-says-no-deadline-on-us-china-trade-deal-266025">Donald Trump</a> during talks with his US counterpart in Washington on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency cited a Russian foreign ministry source as saying.</p>
      <p>Lavrov's trip to Washington for talks with US Secretary of State <a href="https://www.wionews.com/opinions/mike-pompeo-attempts-us-reset-in-the-middle-east-191020">Mike Pompeo</a> comes as bilateral ties are at post-Cold War lows, strained over everything from alleged election meddling to the wars in Ukraine and Syria.</p>
      <p>Time is also running out for the two sides to strike a deal that would replace or extend their New START nuclear arms treaty that is set to expire in February 2021.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.wionews.com/photos/vladimir-putin-a-brief-profile-of-the-russian-president-728">Vladimir Putin</a> last week offered the United States an extension on the deal without any pre-conditions or further discussion.</p>
      <p>Russia's foreign ministry confirmed Lavrov's trip to Washington in a statement. It did not mention a meeting with Trump, but Interfax cited a foreign ministry source saying there would be such a meeting.</p>
      <p>"We expect that (Lavrov) will be received by (Trump) and will hold talks with (Pompeo)," the source was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate response from the United States.</p>
      <p>US intelligence agencies have said Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election campaign in order to tilt the vote in Trump's favor. Moscow has denied any interference.</p>
