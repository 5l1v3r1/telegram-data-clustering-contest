      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:22:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/zulfikar-majid-1" target="_blank">Zulfikar Majid </a></address>
      <p>After the abrogation of Article 370 and re-organisation of Jammu and Kashmir, Union Territory authorities of J&amp;K are invoking Central Prisoners Act to declare the places where the political leaders are detained as subsidiary jails.</p>
      <p>Official documents reveal that the Home Department of J&amp;K UT has established two subsidiary jails in Kashmir under the Prisoners Act, 1900. One is for three former chief ministers – Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar and Mehbooba Mufti - and another for more than 30 politicians including former ministers and legislators detained at MLA hostel in Srinagar.</p>
      <p>The Prisoners Act, 1900 was among the 109 central laws extended to the UTs of J&amp;K and Ladakh, which came into existence on October 31. Before the extension of the Central law, the then Jammu and Kashmir government would declare subsidiary jails under its own law - the Jammu and Kashmir Prisoners Act, Svt 1977.</p>
      <p>The Home Department issued two statutory orders on November 14 declaring House number 6 at Transport Lane, Srinagar, where former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti is detained, and Block A of MLA Hostel along with its premises as subsidiary jails under the Central law.</p>
      <p>“In exercise of the powers conferred by clause(b) of Section 2 of the Prisoners Act 1900 (Act No. 3 of 1900) and in suppression of notification SRO-494 dated 4th August, 2019, the Lieutenant Governor hereby declare block A of MLA Hostel Srinagar along with its premises as subsidiary jail,” reads the notification issued by the Home Department.</p>
      <p>“In exercise of powers conferred by clause(b) of Section 2 of the Prisoners Act 1900, the Government hereby declare House no. 6 at Transport Lane, Srinagar as subsidiary jail,” the notification reads.</p>
      <p>Besides three former chief ministers, over 30 senior politicians, including former ministers and legislators, are undergoing detention since August 5 when the Centre abrogated J&amp;K’s special status under Article 370 and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two UTs.</p>
