      <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama called the ongoing impeachment proceedings "surreal," but said the country would "come back from it" in an interview with former first daughter Jenna Bush Hager on NBC's "Today Show."</p>
      <p>"It's surreal, I think, because the last impeachment hearing — a lot of young people weren't around for that, so this is all new,'' she said. "I don't think people know what to make of it. But do I think we can come back from it? Oh yeah." </p>
      <p>Obama said the country has survived more destabilizing events than President Donald Trump's impeachment. </p>
      <p>"We've seen tough times in this country. You know we've gone through depressions and wars and bombings and terrorist attacks, and we've gone through Jim Crow, and we've always come out stronger," she said. "And that's what we have to continue to believe because what's our choice? To ball up in a corner and call it a day? Well that's not fair to this next generation that's coming before us that are counting on us to get this right."</p>
      <p>She added, "It's not an us or them, it's not an R or a D, we are all here as part of this country. We all want the same things, it's just sometimes that gets lost in the noise."</p>
      <p>Obama conducted the interview in Vietnam, where she was promoting girls' education on her first public international trip since leaving the White House. </p>
