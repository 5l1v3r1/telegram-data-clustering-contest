        <b><a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/alfred-mutua-kicked-out-wiper-party">Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka </a>might be known for his laid-back political nature in the country and but not many might know that he is a top voice in a University in Uganda.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Musyoka is the chancellor of the Uganda Technology and Management University (UTAMU), a private institution located in Kampala, Uganda.</p>
      <p>According to the institution's website, UTAMU is a private University in Uganda founded in 2012 and licensed by the National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) to do teaching, research and community engagement.</p>

      <p>The University was founded by <b>Venansius Baryamureeba</b>, a Ugandan mathematician, computer scientist, and academic administrator who served as the vice-chancellor in the same institution before joining the race to unseat Museveni in 2016.</p>
      <p>Musyoka has been serving in the chancellor's capacity since 2013, with the university announcing on July 26, 2017, that his tenure had been extended to 2021.</p>
      <p>"Uganda Technology and ManagementÂ  University (UTAMU) has extended the chancellorship of H.E. Hon. Dr. Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka for another four years. The former Vice President of the Republic of Kenya has been the Chancellor of UTAMU since his appointment on June 10, 2013," the statement read.</p>
      <p>Kalonzo's tenure, according to the institution, marked a period in which the university grew in leaps and bounds, recording a steady increase from five academic programs to 42 at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.</p>
      <p>It was also during this period that the university reported an increase in the number of students at the institution to over 1,800 as of 2018.</p>
      <p>In 2014, UTAMU was ranked as the 12th best by Webometrics, the largest academic ranking of higher education institutions out of the 37 best universities in Uganda, 10th in 2015 and 2016.</p>
      <p>In March 2017, a report by UniRank, an international higher education search engine, ranked UTAMU as the 8th best University in Uganda.</p>
