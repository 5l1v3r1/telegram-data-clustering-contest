      <h1>The 8 best Christmas wreaths for 2019 (and how to make one at home)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:54:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:54</time> by <a rel="author">Madeleine Howell, Lela London</a></address>
      <p>The wreath is a tradition packed with symbolism; in classical times, they are said to have signalled victory, and now they are synonymous with joy and the welcoming of guests.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://www.thehappygardeners.co.uk/history-of-the-christmas-wreath/">The Happy Gardeners</a>, the word wreath comes from the word “writhen”, an old English word meaning “to writhe” or “to twist.” The circular ring shape is seen to signify eternity, and the evergreens used are also significant, representing growth and the everlasting. </p>
      <p>For many, the making of a Christmas wreath is part of the magic of the festive season (Pinterest is packed with <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/explore/christmas-wreaths/?lp=true">creative ideas</a> to make yours stand out from the crowd, using different materials). </p>
      <p>Those of us a little more strapped for time may prefer to invest in one of these showstopping Christmas wreaths, guaranteed to both impress your guests and give you that elusive fuzzy feeling as you approach your front door on a cold winter's night.</p>

      <h3>How to make a homemade Christmas wreath</h3>
      <p>Sarah Raven's <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardeningadvice/11271019/How-to-make-a-Christmas-wreath-for-your-front-door.html">guide to making a Christmas wreath</a> using moss, berries, leaves and seedheads from the garden:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Harvest a generous trugful of whatever you can find.</li>
        <li>Divide what you've harvested into two groups: a strong, zappy collection of three or four plants and a calmer group of two or three to use as filler.</li>
        <li>Do you have enough colourful stuff to make the wreath punchy? If not, buy some limes, chillis or mini Spartan apples to fill out your home-grown harvest.</li>
        <li>To make the wreath, you'll need a wire base and some moss. Both are available at good garden centres and online. You could also rake moss from shady parts of your lawn.</li>
        <li>The first step is to pad out the wire circle with the moss. Lay an even and generous layer all round the frame. Wire this on to the frame with florists' wire (thin wire on a spool), binding it quite tightly. Aim for the padding to be about 3in (7.5cm) across. Don't get much wider than this or it will look too heavy.</li>
        <li>Add a loop of wire with which to hang up the finished wreath and mark this by tying on a piece of string. It's easy to lose the loop without this string marker when the whole thing is completed.</li>
        <li>The next step is to cover the moss with silver birch, cornus twigs or some sprigs of rosemary – anything pliable and twiggy you have in the garden. They help create a more generous look and strengthen the frame. Push the stem ends in hard so that they jam into the moss and then, every so often, bind them in a curve on to the base with wire.</li>
        <li>Now start to add your trugful of things, beginning with the stronger, more dramatic-coloured group at three, six and nine o'clock in a sort of triangle around the ring (see chillies and limes, above). If they have stems, just poke them into the base and then wire them if you don't think they're sufficiently secure.</li>
        <li>If they don't have good stems, as with apples, chillies and limes, you'll need to create these. Push a length of strong stub wire about a third of the way up the fruit, in and straight out the other side. Bend the first end down to where the stem would be, leaving this long. Then bend the other end down and on to the first and twist them around each other. Add all the wired items to the base, poking the wire through and then bending it round the frame to secure.</li>
        <li>Finally, fill in the areas between the punchy zones with a lighter mix of seedpods and leaves. Keep going until you have covered the base.</li>
        <li>If the moss dries out, rehydrate it by floating the wreath in a sink of water for half an hour every week or so. It will last at least a month if kept cool, hanging outside.</li>
      </ol>
