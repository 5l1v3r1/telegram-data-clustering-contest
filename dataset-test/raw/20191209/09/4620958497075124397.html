      <p>While the Metro Vancouver weather forecast called for a chance of flurries at the start of December, the upcoming week calls for a great deal of rainfall.</p>
      <p>Starting on Monday, Dec. 9, however, Environment Canada calls for sunshine and a high of 7°C during the day. Since the skies will be somewhat clear, the evening is expected to dip down to a chilly 1<b>°</b>C. Following this, Tuesday’s forecast calls for showers and a high of 7<b>°</b>C with a far milder low of 6<b>°</b>C overnight. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are also expected to be mild and wet.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the forecast calls for a day’s respite from the rainfall with a mix of sun and cloud and a high of 6<b>°</b>C; the evening is expected to dip down to a frigid -1<b>°</b>C.</p>
      <p>Sunday is expected to see a 60 per cent chance of showers.</p>

      <h3>B.C. Winter Forecast </h3>
      <p>Back in September, The Weather Network predicted that British Columbia <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/09/16/vancouver-weather-network-bc-fall/">would have a milder winter, but that December was a “wild card.”</a></p>
      <p>Since then, <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/18/vancouver-weather-winter-forecast-bc/">the winter forecast has been updated</a> to include the most recent prediction, which calls for milder temperatures along the B.C. coast and across much of Northern B.C. While northeastern B.C. to the southern interior will see near normal temperatures.</p>
      <p>While the north coast region is, “expected to see above average rainfall and alpine snow,” the south coast region is expected to be drier than normal. With this in mind, the forecast adds that this dry pattern may break at times during the season. During these breaks, the Lower Mainland could have the, “potential to see several weeks’ worth of precipitation in just 5 to 10 days.”</p>
