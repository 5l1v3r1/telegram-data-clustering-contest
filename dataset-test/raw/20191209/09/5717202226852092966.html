      <p>Supposed Tottenham Hotspur transfer target Youcef Atal is set to have surgery to repair a meniscal injury in his knee (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50701349">BBC Sport</a>).</p>
      <p>The Nice full-back will be out for ‘a long time’ after suffering the injury during the 4-1 win over Metz.</p>
      <p>A Nice statement read: “Bad news for Youcef Atal and the Eagles. The diagnosis revealed a meniscal lesion in the right knee.</p>

      <p>“He will be operated on soon and will unfortunately be out of action for a long time.”</p>
      <p>It is a big blow for Patrick Vieira’s team, with Atal a key player.</p>
      <p>The star had made 13 appearances this season and had been in great form for <i>Les Aiglons</i>.</p>
      <p>News of the injury could now force Spurs to rethink their transfer plans, after they were linked earlier this year (<a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/spurs-boss-mauricio-pochettino-plots-20533208">Daily Star</a>).</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Atal injury a big frustration for Spurs</h3>
      <p>Atal’s injury is obviously bad news for Nice, but it could also come as a frustration for Spurs who desperately need a new right-back.</p>

      <p>Atal – who would apparently cost at least £34 million (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/05/01/tottenham-tell-mauricio-pochettino-work-transfer-miracles-smaller/">Telegraph</a>) – is a wonderful player who would undoubtedly improve Spurs on that right flank, but the club surely won’t be able to move for the 23-year-old now.</p>
      <p>He is someone many Spurs fans have been clamouring for in recent weeks, but it looks like any move next month is now off the cards.</p>
