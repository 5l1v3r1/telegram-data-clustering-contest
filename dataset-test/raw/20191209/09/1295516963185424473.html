      <h1>Stargirl Teaser Reveals ANOTHER New Logo Ahead of DC Universe Show's Launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:12:12+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Dominguez</a></address>
      <p>DC Universe has released a (very) short teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/stargirl/">Stargirl</a> -- and with it, the latest iteration of the upcoming superhero series' title logo.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDCUniverse/status/1203886991017775104?s=20">teaser</a> -- which appears to be a shortened version of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dc-universe-first-stargirl-teaser/">now-removed trailer</a> previously shared by DC -- boasts the series' connection to prolific creator Geoff Johns and promises to introduce "a new generation of superheroes." Shortly thereafter, the clip displays the new <i>Stargirl</i> logo, which depicts the show's title written out in sheeny blue, red and yellow letters. The teaser ends with a brief shot of Brec Bassinger's Stargirl wielding the Cosmic Staff.</p>

      <p>The first <i>Stargirl</i> television logo -- in which the titular hero's name is printed in bold yellow -- was revealed as part of the series' <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dc-universe-stargirl-art/">first key art</a> following its <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dc-universe-announces-stargirl-live-action-series/">initial announcement</a> back in the summer of 2018. Just over two weeks ago, DC Universe <a href="https://www.cbr.com/stargirl-dc-universe-new-logo-title-card/">revealed a brand-new logo</a> for the series, which saw "<i>Stargirl</i>" written in metallic cursive. Now that another title card with yet another new design, it seems the streaming network is fine-tuning <i>Stargirl</i>'s aesthetic ahead of its premiere next year.</p>
      <p>DC Universe's <i>Stargirl</i> follows Courtney Whitmore (played by Bassinger), a high school student who discovers her stepfather once served as sidekick to the superhero Starman. Courtney becomes the new wielder of Starman's Cosmic Staff in order to usher in a new era of superheroes as Stargirl. The series will feature multiple other DC characters, including members of the Justice Society of America and the Injustice Society.</p>
