      <h2>Boris Johnson was challenged live on LBC over "made up" figures from Home Secretary Priti Patel about an alleged violent crimewave that would follow a Labour victory in this week's general election</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:55:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Taylor, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson struggled to explain the Conservative Party's "made up" crime and HS2 figures during a flailing interview.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister was grilled over Home Secretary Priti Patel's claims that a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> win in this week's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> would spark a violent crimewave.</p>
      <p>She said there would be 4,000 more violent assaults, 150 extra sex assaults and 52 more murders each year under Labour - because of the party's opposition to police stop-and-search powers.</p>
      <p>LBC radio presenter Nick Ferrari asked Mr Johnson to explain the source of the figures.</p>
      <p>He said during the live interview: "How does she come by these figures?</p>
      <p>"You're a journalist, I'm a journalist, where'd she get those figures?"</p>
      <p>In a rambling reply, the Tory leader said: "The answer, very simply, is that to tackle crime you need not just (to support) the police by putting the police out on the street, which is what we're doing."</p>

      <p>When pinned down on the figures once again, Mr Johnson said: "Forgive me Nick, I haven't been able to..." before Mr Ferrari shot back: "She's made them up, Prime Minister, hasn't she?"</p>
      <p>Ms Patel's original <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/08/labours-opposition-stop-search-could-lead-52-murders-claims/">Daily Telegraph article</a> claimed the figures were from the Conservative research department.</p>
      <p>During the LBC interview, Mr Ferrari also suggested the Prime Minister had "made up" figures about the total cost of HS2.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson says HS2 will probably cost "north of £100 billion" even though the current estimate is £88 billion.</p>
      <p>Questioned on why he was using the £100 billion figure, he said: "It's a figure I've used many times in the past."</p>
