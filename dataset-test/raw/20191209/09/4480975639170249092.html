      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:32:06+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Investor confidence in the <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/country/c9822cb1-6cee-45f4-a9a2-89d136990308">Eurozone</a></b> improved sharply in December, despite looming US-China trade tensions and German recession, the latest data published by the Sentix research group showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>The gauge jumped to +0.7 in December from -4.5 in November and against a reading of -4.9 expected. The investors’ morale hit the highest since March 2018.</p>
      <p>Sentix Managing Director Patrick Hussy said: " More and more investors are convinced that the worst is over for the economy in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a> zone and that impulses from the central bank and politicians will stimulate the economy in the coming months.”</p>
      <p>"Investor optimism was best reflected in labor markets, which had remained "extremely robust" despite economic weakness in Europe and the United States over the past two years. That would soon feed through into wage inflation," Hussy added.</p>
