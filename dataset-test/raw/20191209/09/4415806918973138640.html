      <p>“You haven’t really missed much, but great to have you back.”</p>
      <p>Whyment said: “That was banned in camp, that word was banned.”</p>
      <p>He added that it had been a “mad old day” since the winner was announced, and he had only been given half an hour to take a shower after leaving the jungle.</p>
      <p>Garraway, who came fourth, said: “I’m so pleased I did it, it was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“You know when you watch the show and think ‘That looks really hard, I could never do it’, and it was really hard and I couldn’t really do it!”</p>
