      <p>The New Year is traditionally the time when we turn our attention to our health, with vows that this will be the year that we do something about it.</p>
      <p>The great news is that if you are in need of an operation in 2020, Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre has three routes to treatment at the CQC-rated ‘Outstanding’ hospital.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NHS</b>
      </p>
      <p>You can access treatment via the NHS. Provided your GP or other referring medical practitioner agrees you need an operation, and it is for a procedure the hospital carries out, you can ask to be referred to Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre for your care.</p>
      <p>It is your right to choose under the NHS Constitution, which also says that you can ask to be switched to another hospital with a shorter waiting list for you operation, if you have been told you must wait for more than 18 weeks.</p>
      <p>Waiting lists at Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre are typically shorter than other NHS alternatives.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Self-pay</b>
      </p>
      <p>The self-pay option is for patients who do not wish to be put on a lengthy NHS waiting list or who have been told that the care they needed was no longer available on the NHS. It is an option which is proving especially popular with people who run their own businesses, or whose life commitments mean it is important to be able to plan when their surgery takes place.</p>
      <p>Self-pay means that patients can choose to pay for their consultant-led care at Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre at a greatly reduced rate compared with local private health providers, and there is a 0 per cent finance option to spread the costs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Private medical insurance</b>
      </p>
      <p>A select number of private medical insurers will support care at Peninsula Treatment Centre. Insurance company details are available on the hospital’s website below</p>
      <p>Mark White, Hospital Director at Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre, said: “Treatment at Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre is now accessible to any patient in need of care regardless of how they choose to access services, be that via the NHS, self-funding or using private medical insurance.”</p>
      <p>Surgical teams at Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre carry out a wide range of orthopaedic procedures for hips, knees, shoulder and elbows, feet and ankles, and hands and wrists. </p>
      <p>It also offers cataract treatment, endoscopy and general surgery (such as hernia repair and gallbladder removal). The hospital was the first of its kind to achieve an ‘Outstanding’ rating from the Care Quality Commission.</p>
