      <p><b>LAHORE:</b> Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar on Monday said corruption is the biggest hurdle in the country’s progress and prosperity.</p>
      <p>In his message on the International Anti-Corruption Day which is being observed today, the Punjab governor asserted that Prime Minister Imran Khan has freed all the anti-graft watchdogs of undue political interference.</p>
      <p>“Condemnation of corruption is indispensable at every forum. Moral turpitude is, in fact, the base of financial corruption and we must get rid of the menace of corruption,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Our government has a zero-tolerance policy against corruption. We want a corruption-free Pakistan. All of us must pledge today to raise voice against this evil at every platform.”</p>
