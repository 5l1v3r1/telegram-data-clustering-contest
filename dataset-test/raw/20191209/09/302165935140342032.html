      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — Lynas Corporation Ltd said today it will open a new cracking and leaching plant in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia to extract low-level radioactivity from materials to be shipped to Malaysia for final treatment.</p>
      <p>The Australia-based rare earth miner said it has signed an option to sublease an industrial-zoned property from the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder with the proposed terms being finalised.</p>
      <p>“The signing of this option follows our signing of an MOU with the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, details of which were announced on September 6, 2019,” company secretary Andrew Arnold said in a statement, referring to a memorandum of understanding.</p>
      <p>“Lynas’ Kalgoorlie cracking and leaching plant will upgrade the Lynas Mt Weld rare earth concentrate that is currently exported to the Lynas rare earth processing facility in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“It is a further step towards delivering on the Australian Government’s Critical Minerals Strategy and the objective of the Western Australian Government for more downstream processing.</p>
      <p>“Lynas will also explore opportunities for the next stage processing (upstream solvent extraction) in Western Australia,” he added.</p>
      <p>The new planned cracking and leaching plant in Western Australia will form part of a US$500 million (RM2.08 billion) growth strategy to boost production by 2025, it said.</p>
      <p>After lengthy tensions with Putrajaya over environmental concerns about its operations in Malaysia, Lynas was given four years by the country to build a plant to remove low-level radioactivity from material it ships here for processing into elements vital for products ranging from fighter jets to wind farms.</p>
      <p>The firm will invest in infrastructure and supply chain capabilities to form the basis of further industry development in the region.</p>
