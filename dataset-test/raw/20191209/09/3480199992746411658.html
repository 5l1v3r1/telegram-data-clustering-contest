      <p>And a large proportion of those seizures have come around Christmas time, when crooks are fully aware that more people than usual are out looking for a bargain.</p>
      <p>This year will certainly be no exception, and shoppers are advised to be on the lookout for poor quality imitations which could easily take the shine off the festive season.</p>
      <p>There has been a rise in the number of online sellers offering next-day delivery on toys that are out of stock elsewhere, with buyers only finding out that the items do not exist once they have handed over their cash.</p>
      <p>Not only do such items leave people out of pocket, they can also be dangerous.</p>
      <p>There have been numerous occasions where trading standards officers have seized fake booze, such as vodka and gin that contains extremely harmful chemicals.</p>
      <p>There have been instances where people have been blinded after consuming dodgy alcohol, while fake perfume had caused people to receive burns on their skin.</p>
      <p>Experts warn that fake toys can contain toxic materials, damage hearing and pose choking or strangulation risks.</p>
      <p>Aside from the health risks, counterfeit sales also have a negative effect on our local economy.</p>
      <p>With high streets all around the region struggling, due largely to the continuing rise of online shopping, our local stores need all the help they can get.</p>
      <p>We should all be committed to using the legitimate shops in our community.</p>
      <p>No right-minded person can be happy lining the pockets of criminals.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that fake items are increasingly hard to detect just by looking at them.</p>
      <p>But while the product may look legitimate, it does not usually take long for the reality to dawn on the unsuspecting buyer.</p>
      <p>As the old adage goes, if something is too good to be true, it usually is.</p>
