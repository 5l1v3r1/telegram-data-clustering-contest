      <h1>Daniel Batty will have a point to prove to Leeds United after boyhood release</h1>
      <h2>Leeds United face off with Hull City in the Championship this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:45:46+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United take on Hull City in midweek as they attempt to continue their fine six-game winning streak. The Tigers are themselves enjoying a good run of form, winning five of their last eight games in the Championship. That form leaves them 12th in the league, just three points off Sheffield Wednesday in sixth.</p>
      <p>One of the key players in their recent form has been young midfielder Daniel Batty. The 21-year-old has established himself as a regular for the club recently, playing in their last four matches and starring in the weekend win against Stoke City. </p>

      <p>He, more than many others, will have a special reason for wanting the get the best of Leeds United at the weekend. </p>
      <p>Batty is a boyhood Leeds United fan and, in fact, grew up in the Leeds United academy. </p>
      <p>The midfielder, no relation to Elland Road great David Batty, was with Leeds from the age of five all the way until under-16s. At that point, he was released for being ‘too small’, as he detailed in a 2018 interview <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dan-batty-ready-prove-leeds-1847287">with the Hull Daily Mail.</a> </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“I’d to think they’re looking at me and thinking they’ve made a mistake. Leeds were my team growing up and I was there from the age of five right up to under-16s. That’s when I was released.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“I was devastated. I was in tears. That proved that I cared and how much I wanted it…</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“The main reasons for me getting released was because I was too small and not strong enough. I had to battle through that, learn from it and hopefully get a bit stronger. I’ve been working work hard ever since I got here. I’m pushing as much as I can.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This week he will be up against a very imposing Leeds United midfield including Mateusz Klich and the returning Kalvin Phillips, a player who did make it through the Leeds academy. </p>
      <p>It will be a hard task showing the West Yorkshire side how they made a mistake in such a clash. But Leeds fans will no doubt be keeping an extra eye on a player they decided would not make the grade. </p>
