      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> will not be doing any interviews today despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/im-celebrity-2019-jacqueline-jossa-crowned-winner-emotional-finale-11412652/">winning I’m A Celebrity… Get Me out of Here!</a> following an explosive few weeks for husband Dan Osborne, according to Lorraine Kelly.</p>
      <p>Traditionally the King or Queen of The Jungle would be doing the rounds of morning television after their victory, but the former EastEnders actress will be enjoying time out of the limelight instead.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old leapt into the arms of her hubby in an emotional reunion last night after she reportedly spoke to the former Towie star in unaired scenes over rumours he cheated with fellow camp mate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a>’s ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>

Dan also denied these claims.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Roman Kemp today, Lorraine explained: ‘I know she’s not doing interviews – I hope she’s having a bubble bath!’</p>
      <p>The Capital FM presenter revealed Jacqueline almost quit the series but he managed to convince her to stay.</p>
      <p>‘I said, “if you stay you can win it,”’ he told Lorraine.</p>

      <p>Following her shock win, after bookies tipped Andy Whyment to take the title, Jacqueline told hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/im-celeb-winner-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-tears-fears-seen-doormat-11413281/">didn’t want to be seen as a doormat.</a></p>
      <p>‘It’s so easy to care so much what other people think of you, people who say nasty things for the sake of it,’ she began</p>
      <p>‘I try to change their opinion and it doesn’t make sense, but in here, you have no choice. You have to be you. I’ve had amazing people constantly bigging me up.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I feel like I’ve come in here and proven myself.’</p>
      <p>Sharing a cosy photo with the winner of I’m A Celeb today, Dan wrote: ‘My jungle Queen! Words can not describe how proud I am of this woman!<br/>‘She absolutely smashed it from day 1 and deserves this sooo much!! Well done baby.’</p>
