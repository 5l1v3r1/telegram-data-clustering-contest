      <p>Lamar Patterson’s hot hand wasn’t enough to help the Brisbane Bullets, whose NBL road woes continued with a 96-85 loss to the New Zealand Breakers in Auckland.</p>
      <p>American forward Patterson scored 36 points, a career-high in the NBL, but fatigue caught up with him in the final quarter when his influence waned and the Breakers held on for their fourth win of the season.</p>
      <p>The seventh-placed Bullets have lost six of their past seven on the road and slip to 6-8 for the season, with the Breakers (4-9) one spot behind them on the ladder.</p>

      <p>It was a crucial result for the Kiwi hosts, who suffered another setback in a tumultuous season when American import Glen Rice Jr. was sacked earlier on Monday, for a breach of his bail conditions.</p>
      <p>They were also without rising star RJ Hampton, who is awaiting scan results on a hip injury.</p>

      <p>Those blows were countered by the return from injury of big-scoring guards Corey Webster and Scotty Hopson, who were both influential.</p>
      <p>Webster top-scored for the hosts with 23, supported by captain Tom Abercrombie’s 19. A third Kiwi, Finn Delany, mixed 14 points with eight rebounds.</p>
      <p>The Brisbane stats sheet was more lop-sided. While Patterson’s haul was the most by any Bullets player since their return to the NBL in 2016, their next biggest contributor was Jason Cadee with 11.</p>
      <p>Three-point shooting was a major differential, with the hosts landing nine of 21 compared to Brisbane’s lamentable six of 25 from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p>Both teams spurned decent early leads to be level 47-47 at half-time but the New Zealand held sway after the main break, helped by some spectacular Hopson dunks in the final quarter.</p>
