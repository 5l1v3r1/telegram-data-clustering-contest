      <h1>How much money are people willing to spend on their kids this Christmas?</h1>
      <h2>Are you going to spend more or less than the UK average?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:12:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Trinity Shaw, Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>New figures from money.com estimate Brits will spend massively this Christmas, buying well over £33.3billion worth of gifts for family and friends.</p>
      <p>Children will see the bulk of this money spent on them, with a national average of £105.99 for older children and £129.79 for under-16s comparative to partners and spouses who receive around £120.51. And mums and dads having roughly £60 spent per parent.</p>
      <p>A 2,000 person study by Nationwide earlier this year suggested a lot less will be spent in 2019, with people spending around two weeks wages over the entire span of Christmas - equating to around £727 for celebrations, work parties and festivities.</p>
      <p>Roughly 1 in 12 will spend more than this, splashing over £800 - with some landing in crippling debt, reports <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/amount-money-parents-spend-kids-17362497">LiverpoolEcho</a> .</p>
      <p>Guy Simmonds head of customer management at Nationwide, said: "The cost of Christmas can quickly mount up.</p>
      <p>"t's incredibly easy to spend more than we can afford. Planning is vital to sensible spending."</p>
      <p>Figures from Nationwide show nearly one in five people will be struggling financially by January, one in 10 will end up deep into their overdraft and 7% will start 2020 in significant debt.</p>

        <b>
          <b>How much people spend on each item/person at Christmas:</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>£363 for food</p>
      <p>£67 for kids</p>
      <p>£40 for mums</p>
      <p>£33 for dads</p>
      <p>£28 for grandparents</p>
      <p>£31 for sibings</p>
      <p>£30 for inlaws</p>
      <p>£22 for uncles and aunts</p>
      <p>£20 for pets</p>
      <p>£63 for partners.</p>
      <p>This is despite the 4% of people who admit to spending nothing on their other half. And 23% feeling pressure to buy Secret Santa presents for colleagues.</p>
      <p>The expense is not helped by 42% of men and 33% of women setting no budget on their Christmas. The figures setting no budget are 45% in north east england, 44% in Scotland and 49% in wales.</p>
      <p>This compares to 30% of people from the south west who bought two to six months in advance.</p>
      <p>The advice is to budget well and keep tabs on your money this Christmas.</p>
