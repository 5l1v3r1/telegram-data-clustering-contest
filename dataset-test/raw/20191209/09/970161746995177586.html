      <h1>Caitlyn Jenner celebrates 'sweet friend' Jacqueline Jossa's I'm A Celebrity win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:24:17+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author">Cydney Yeates</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> was seriously stoked that her ‘sweet friend’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> was crowned the winner of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! last night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/im-celebrity-2019-jacqueline-jossa-crowned-winner-emotional-finale-11412652/">Jacqueline was named Queen of the Jungle</a>, beating the likes of Coronation Street’s Andy Whyment and Roman Kemp in the nail-biting finale, and the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star celebrated her fellow campmate’s victory in the most lovely way.</p>
      <p>Showing her love for the former EastEnders actress, Caitlyn shared a selfie of the pair together and posted it to her 9.8million Instagram followers.</p>
      <p>Captioning the pic, she wrote: ‘Congratulations to my sweet friend @jacjossa witnessing your growth on this show was amazing! Congrats Jungle Jack!’</p>
      <p>We bet Jacqueline will be made up by the heartwarming post.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn and Jacqueline became good friends while living it up in the I’m A Celebrity jungle.</p>
      <p>Early on in the series, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/caitlyn-jenner-compares-jacqueline-jossa-kylie-jenner-smashes-im-celebrity-bushtucker-trials-11211799/">Caitlyn compared the soap star to her daughter Kylie Jenner</a> after she’d smashed her Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Giving her encouragement, especially after she got 12 stars for the camp, Caitlyn told Jacqueline: ‘After you came back and you were all happy and that good feeling you should be and you reminded me of Kylie.</p>
      <p>‘Enthusiastic, like wow, here we go. We’re doing this, wow that was fun, you know. It’s very much that way.’</p>
      <p>Naturally, Jacqueline was bowled over by Caitlyn’s remark and excitedly exclaimed in the Bush Telegraph: ‘How cool is that?!</p>
      <p>‘Caitlyn Jenner just casually said, “oh you remind me of Kylie.” Winning. Winning! She always notices when I’m down, she notices when I need picking up, and she’s just really, really an amazing person.’</p>
