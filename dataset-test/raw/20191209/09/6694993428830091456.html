      <h1>Manchester teacher reveals what it's really like to work in a secondary school</h1>
      <h2>Joshua Griffiths has been helped along the way by the Chartered College of Teaching</h2>

      <p>If it's been a while since you were last at school - either as a parent or a teacher - what goes on behind the gates once the bell rings can be a mystery.</p>
      <p>Most of us remember our school days fondly and wish we could go back, but for those who pursued a career in education, their days in the classroom continue.</p>
      <p>Shaping young minds and passing on their knowledge holds a lot of responsibility. It's not a job for everyone so we wanted to find out what it's really like to work as a teacher in <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester">Manchester</a> .</p>
      <p>We spoke to Dr. Josh Griffiths, a science teacher at Cedar Mount Academy in <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gorton">Gorton</a> , to find out the truth about teaching.</p>
      <p>Josh is a member of the Chartered College of Teaching - an organisation which helps support the professional development of teachers across the country. Here he tells us how it is benefiting him and his pupils.</p>
      <h3>Have you always wanted to be a teacher?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Having grown up with a father who was a secondary school teacher, Josh admitted that although he had always admired his work, it was not something he immediately saw himself doing.</p>
      <p>He said: "I remember going into school with him and seeing how he loved the work he did.</p>
      <p>"Several times when I was younger, I remember going with him to boxing matches and musicals that his pupils were performing in.</p>
      <p>"They always came over at the end to see him. You could tell that they not only respected him but that he was more than just someone who taught them the curriculum.</p>
      <p>"He was someone who supported them and was a constant, even when home life may have been complicated."</p>
      <p>But it was during his PhD in ocean physics that Josh decided on pursuing a career in teaching.</p>
      <p>He said: "During my PhD, I got the opportunity to give talks, lead seminars and run workshops for a whole range of people. I loved when I was able to achieve that click when they were suddenly able to understand something that they thought they never could."</p>
      <p>Once his PhD came to an end, Josh discovered Researchers in Schools, a programme that allowed him to carry on doing research part time while also training to become a teacher.</p>
      <h3>What do you like the most about teaching?</h3>

      <p>A teacher for the last two years, Josh previously worked at Oasis Academy in Oldham where he completed his QTS and NQT years.</p>
      <p>He is now teaching at <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cedar-mount-academy">Cedar Mount Academy</a> , a school that teaches 824 pupils aged 11 to 16. Born in Stockport, it's just a few miles from where he grew up.</p>
      <p>Josh told us what he likes the most about being a teacher.</p>
      <p>He said: "One of the best feelings is when you teach a pupil something and then with that knowledge they ask you a question that you had never even considered."</p>
      <p>His colleagues and the supportive community within the school is also a highlight for this Manchester teacher.</p>
      <p>He said: "Teaching is like working indefinitely to complete an unfinishable piece of art. Everyday pupils come to me with new challenges and new questions that I have to figure out how I will solve and how I will change my teaching to improve for next time.</p>
      <p>"This would seem like an unsurmountable task were it just for me to carry out, but it is not. It is undeniable that the team that I get to work with everyday and the community that is present in a school has got to be one of the best things about my job."</p>
      <p>He also gets a lot of job satisfaction from his pupils.</p>
      <p>He added: "Seeing a pupil's face when they see that they have done better than they ever expected before makes me proud to be a teacher."</p>
      <h3>What is the funniest thing a child has ever said to you?</h3>

      <p>Being a science teacher, Josh told us how this has led to many funny moments and conversations in the classroom.</p>
      <p>He said: "Human biology often leads to a lot of hilarious questions, some of which may be better left unmuttered.</p>
      <p>"Often in science, funny comments come out of misconceptions, such as 'if I don't have ribs and someone touches my heart, it will explode'."</p>
      <p>Josh's wife is a primary school teacher which means he has also heard about some funny classroom discussions with younger children.</p>
      <p>He said: "My wife once had a pupil, who after watching a black and white film, asked completely straight-faced what year the world became colourful."</p>
      <h3>How many times a day do you get called dad?</h3>
      <p>Surprisingly, being called dad is not something that happens regularly to Josh, but there have been other embarrassing slips of the tongue.</p>
      <p>He told us: "I get called Miss about 10 times a day. I normally tell the pupils to call me either Sir or Dr. Griffiths."</p>
      <h3>What is the hardest thing about being a teacher?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Although an extremely rewarding role, being a teacher holds a lot responsibility and with that, a lot of pressure.</p>
      <p>Josh said: "As a teacher you always feel like there are many people depending on you; your pupils, your fellow teachers, your support staff.</p>
      <p>"As much as there have been big pushes to improve workload, it is still there and the stresses are undeniably still present; are my lessons ready? Is my work marked? Have I sent that email off?</p>
      <p>"Did that lesson go well? How can I deal with the behaviour of a pupil? What will that observer think of my lesson? What have I not done?</p>
      <p>"This is difficult, especially when you are dealing with the stresses present in your everyday life."</p>
      <h3>What is the biggest myth about teaching?</h3>
      <p>But with all the holidays, finishing at 3pm and not working weekends, getting so much time off work might sound like a dream but this is just a common misconception about teaching.</p>
      <p>Josh added: "Teaching is not 9am to 3pm Monday to Friday.</p>
      <p>"Teaching is often working all weekend marking exams or working late into the night making sure that the lessons you are doing in the morning are the best they can be."</p>
      <h3>Why did you want to become a member of the Chartered College of Teaching?</h3>

      <p>Josh has been a teacher for two years and became a member shortly after becoming a teacher.</p>
      <p>With an interest in research, Josh told us his reasons behind becoming a member.</p>
      <p>He said: "I feel research is the best way to improve. The Chartered College pushes the revolution of evidence-informed teaching, including through their journals, which is one that I wholeheartedly support.</p>
      <p>"In addition, I feel that the College provides a way to demonstrate that teaching is a professional career and through a body such as this, will provide teaching with the reputation it deserves."</p>
      <h3>What are the benefits to being a member?</h3>

        <figcaption>Being a member of the Chartered College of Teaching gives teachers access to resources including regular journals</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Through his membership, Josh has made real use of the resources available to him and feels as though it has impacted his time in the classroom.</p>
      <p>He said: "I often use information from the Impact journals to improve my classroom practice and broaden my belief of how things can be done differently."</p>
      <p>The opportunity to network with others in the profession is another benefit of the membership.</p>
      <p>Josh told us: "The Chartered College connects you with a network of teachers who are similarly eager to improve the profession.</p>
      <p>"This is not working on your own, not working in your school but working nationally to improve education - a noble yet achievable aim."</p>
      <p>Becoming a member is something that Josh recommends to all teachers.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think that membership should not be a question, it should be fundamental to being a teacher.</p>
      <p>"I know of many SCITT providers who are now providing their new trainee teachers with memberships as part of their entry. I believe it is only a matter of time until this becomes the case in schools themselves."</p>
