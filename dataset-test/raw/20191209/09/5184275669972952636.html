A lot of stars attended the award show, like Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Taapsee Pannu, Ayushmann Khurrana, Sara Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and many others. Alia Bhatt had to skip the awards night due to prior commitments.</p>
      <p>While Bhatt didn’t attend the function, she made sure to collect her trophy before the main event. The Raazi actress was papped leaving with her award which she won for her performance in Gully Boy.
