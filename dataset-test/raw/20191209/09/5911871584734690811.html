      <p>Kaya Wilkins is releasing her second album as Okay Kaya, <i>Watch This Liquid Pour Itself</i>, at the end of January. We’ve heard two tracks from it already, “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058406/okay-kaya-ascend-and-try-again/video/">Ascend And Try Again</a>” and “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2064646/okay-kaya-baby-little-tween-video/video/">Baby Little Tween</a>,” and today Wilkins is sharing a new one called “Asexual Wellbeing.”</p>
      <p>The track’s music video, which Wilkins co-directed with Adinah Dancyger, starts with a breathy spoken word piece before launching into the track proper, a rubbery synth song about the spectrum of desire. “I know sex with me is mediocre, but I can give you asexual wellbeing,” Wilkins sings. “But I can probably feel what you’re feeling.”</p>
      <p>Wilkins had this to say in a press release:</p>
