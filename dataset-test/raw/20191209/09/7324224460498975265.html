      <h2>Rosie Swarbrick rates the players as Wolves drew 2-2 at Brighton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:28:23+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/rosie-swarbrick/" target="_blank">Rosie Swarbrick</a></address>
      <p><b>Rui Patricio 6</b> Did the hard work by getting a hand to the first goal, but he was too easily beaten at that post. Needs to improve when dealing with shots from distance. Normal standards were resumed in the second half though as he helped Wolves preserve a point.</p>
      <p><b>Leander Dendoncker 6</b> A bit hit and miss at the moment. After a storming performance against West Ham, he picked up where he left off against Sheffield United with a shaky showing. He needs to find some consistency to cement his place at the back once everyone is fit.</p>
      <p><b>Conor Coady 6</b> Could have done more to stop Neal Maupay for the first goal. All of Wolves’ defence went to sleep at the end of that first half, but Coady produced an improved second-half performance which was summed up by that late, brave block.</p>
      <p><b>Romain Saiss 6</b> Like in Wednesday’s win over West Ham, he nearly got a goal. Wolves' best defender on the day, but like the rest of the backline, he delivered a shaky final 20 minutes in that first half. Like Coady and Patricio, improved in the second half as Wolves contained Brighton.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Doherty 6</b>  A quiet first half as Brighton targeted Wolves’ right flank. He was involved a lot more in the second half, which aided Traore’s game. But could have brought a touch more end product to help Wolves find the extra goal that would have given them victory.</p>
      <p><b>Ruben Neves 7</b>  A key cog in Wolves’ play. Brighton’s desire to pass the ball around ended up playing into his and Moutinho’s hands as they helped harry and press the hosts into mistakes. He had a thunderous strike, but more is still needed from him in attack.</p>
      <p><b>Joao Moutinho 7</b> Like Neves, played a key role in Wolves’ engine room. As soon as Brighton started to pass the ball around their own half, his eyes lit up. His set-pieces could have been better though – delivery was not on the mark like it usually is.</p>
      <p><b>Jonny Castro Otto 7</b> Intelligent play to pick up that loose pass in Brighton’s half for the second Jota goal. But needs to keep focus for the full 90 minutes. He was guilty of giving the ball away in a dangerous position in his own half in the second period.</p>
      <p><b>Adama Traore 7</b>  A quiet first half due to Brighton’s tactics, but lit up the right wing after the interval. The only way Brighton could deal with his pace was to foul him. Referees need to be stronger when teams are deploying those methods to stop Wolves’ flying winger.</p>
      <p><b>Raul Jimenez 7</b> Tired in the second half, but his link-up play with Jota in the first half was high class. The way they linked up showed how strong their connection is. Brighton could not handle the duo in that first 45 minutes and his pass for the opening goal was delightful.</p>
      <p><b>Diogo Jota 8</b> Ended his goal drought with a sublime performance. At times in the first half, he was unplayable and hit the levels we expect from him. The only slight on his performance is that he should have had a hat-trick after going through one-on-one.</p>
      <p>Subs: <b>Neto on for Jota 76, 6</b>. Hard to replace Jota when he was in that form</p>
      <p><b>Cutrone on for Jimenez 84, 6</b>. Brought energy and fresh legs off the bench.</p>
      <p><b>Vinagre on for Traore 90, 5</b>. Not enough time to make an impact  </p>
