      <h1>DART security alert system receiving dozens of passenger texts each month</h1>

        <b>Fireworks being set off on-board, passengers drinking and taking drugs and people urinating on platforms are some of the alerts sent to DART security staff.</b>
      </p>
      <p>145 texts were sent over a three-month period after the monitored alert system was <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/dart-text-alert-anti-social-895129">introduced in August</a></b>.</p>
      <p>More than a third of passengers complained about anti-social behaviour involving groups of teenagers, <b><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/security-alert-for-dart-getting-60-plus-passenger-texts-monthly-1.4108678">the <i>Irish Times</i> reports</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Barry Kenny from Irish Rail said 'large groups being intimidating' remains one of the biggest concerns for DART users, and that has been reflected in the text alerts.</p>
      <p>He explained: "It isn't a situation where there's a violent situation, but nonetheless... we recognise how intimidating that can be.</p>
      <blockquote>"We're ensuring that our security personnel are addressing these issues as they're reported."</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Kenny said there are often situations when an alert is sent, but the passengers involved would get off the train shortly after.</p>
      <p>However, he stressed that the company is ready to deploy security teams 'immediately' when needed.</p>
      <p>He added that they're hoping to expand the alert system to Commuter train services in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Anyone who sees something that concerns them on a DART or is the victim of an incident can text TRAIN to 51444.</p>
      <p>The text alerts the DART security centre and allows them to dispatch roving security teams - or, where appropriate, alert gardaí.</p>
