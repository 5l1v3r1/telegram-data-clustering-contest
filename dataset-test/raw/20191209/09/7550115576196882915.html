        <b>Liverpool’s visit to Asia next summer will consist of just one match in China and not a full pre-season tour, it is reported.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Reds didn’t visit the continent last summer, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> having been disappointed after the trip to Hong Kong in 2017 was beset by problems due to waterlogged pitches.</p>
      <p>That meant Klopp requested a return to America last summer, rather than alternating between heading west and east as has been the norm for the club over recent history.</p>
      <p>So with a new kit deal with Nike also in the pipeline and their massive distribution in Asia, the club decided to grant Klopp’s wish and delay their return to the continent.</p>
      <p>It’s now <a href="https://theathletic.com/1440713/2019/12/09/ornstein-on-monday-city-planning-for-life-after-pep-koscielny-and-ozils-goodbyes-to-emery-and-contract-talks-for-leicesters-maddison-and-soyuncu/?source=shared-article">reported</a>, by <i>the Athletic</i>‘s David Ornstein, that Liverpool will only play one game though rather than a full pre-season ‘tour’.</p>
      <p>Klopp is said to be keen to ensure most of the pre-season is spent in Europe, and owners FSG are to grant that wish.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have spent increasingly less time on vast pre-season tours under Klopp, with training camps instead taking place in Europe, including in Germany and France in the last two summers.</p>
      <p>That could mean taking part in the Audi Cup in Munich, as the Reds did in summer 2017, basing themselves at nearby Rottach-Egern.</p>
      <p>What’s pleasing is to see the owners and decision-makers at the club put football before business decisions and granting Klopp these wishes, however disappointing that may be for fans in Asia.</p>

      <p>Speaking in Hong Kong after monsoon-like conditions had greeted the players on their arrival, Klopp said: “I’m a football manager, I’m interested in the game, I’m interested in the quality of the game and different things have influence on the quality.”</p>
      <p>The Reds played two games in the PL Asia Cup, on a pitch that then-<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sunderland">Sunderland</a> boss Paulo di Canio had described as a “killer pitch” and had seen Jan Vertonghen suffer ankle ligament damage in waterlogged conditions.</p>
      <p>Liverpool also played in torrential rain against a Thai All-Stars side in 2015 in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>As things stand, Liverpool cannot launch their new Nike kits until after June 30, due to the New Balance deal not ending until then, so a launch of a kit in China seems highly likely.</p>
