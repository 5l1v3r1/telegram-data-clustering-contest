        <b>2019 was a mixed season for Red Bull as they finished third in the Constructors' Championship but Max Verstappen led them to three race wins. Helmut Marko believes the team are yet to reach their potential.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Verstappen's wins in Austria, a chaotic German Grand Prix and Brazil helped the Dutchman to third in the Drivers' Championship. However, at the start of the season Helmut Marko called for the team to aim for five race wins, and although Toro Rosso achieved two podiums, five wins was not achieved.</p>
      <p>This was not helped by the uncertainty the team faced in regards to Verstappen's partner with Alex Albon seeing out the year after Pierre Gasly started it. Marko believes the team still have a lot of developing to do. At a commemoration for Jochen Rindt, explained why they maybe didn't reach their potential this season. </p>

      <p><i>“We have not reached our potential. On the one hand this was due to unfortunate circumstances, such as crashes, as well as that the combination of chassis and Honda engine only really got going later,"</i> the Austrian told the press.</p>
