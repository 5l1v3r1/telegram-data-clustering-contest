      <p>Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti has directed the police to fish out the killers of one Dotun Kosedake who was shot during Saturday’s local government election in the state.</p>
      <p>The governor gave the directive in a statement issued on Sunday night in Ado-Ekiti by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Yinka Oyebode.</p>
      <p>He, however, expressed satisfaction at the general conduct of the election.</p>
      <p>He congratulated all APC members that were newly elected Chairmen and Councillors of the 16 local government councils.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN) reports that this followed official announcement of the results of Saturday’s council election by the State Independent Electoral Commission which the ruling APC won.</p>
      <p>” While the election was largely peaceful, the incident in Ikere was, however, a sour point.</p>
      <p>” We commiserate with the family of the deceased, even as I have directed the police in the state to investigate what actually transpired and bring the perpetrators to book,” he said.</p>
      <p>He lauded the professionalism of the EKSIEC officials under the leadership of Justice Jide Aladejana, saying that the hitch-free nature of the election was a reflection of their professional conduct.</p>
      <p>Fayemi said he was particularly impressed the election held under a peaceful atmosphere as voters and SIEC officials conducted themselves in orderly manner.</p>
      <p>While congratulating the newly elected council chiefs, the governor urged them to see their election as a call to service, adding that they could not afford to disappoint those who voted for them.</p>
      <p>He reminded them of his administration’s zero-tolerance for corruption and mediocrity, adding that it was no longer business as usual in the councils.</p>
      <p>“I congratulate the good people of Ekiti State, for demonstrating their peaceful nature and love for democracy during Saturday’s council poll</p>
      <p>” The professionalism of SIEC under the leadership of Justice Jide Aladejana is also commendable</p>
      <p>“I also congratulate and welcome on board all our newly elected chairmen and councillors</p>
      <p>” I urge them to see their election as a call to serve and should do their best not to disappoint the people that voted for them.</p>
      <p>“ They should be guided by the fact that our administration has zero-tolerance for corruption and it is certainly not going to be business as usual in our councils this time around</p>
      <p>“While the election was largely peaceful, the incident in Ikere was, however, a sour point</p>
      <p>” We commiserate with the family of the deceased, even as I have directed the police in the state to investigate what actually transpired and bring the perpetrators to book,” the statement quoted Fayemi as saying.</p>
