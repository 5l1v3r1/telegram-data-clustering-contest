      <p>Transport Minister Phil Twyford today announced construction is underway on Wellington commuter rail upgrades which will mean more frequent services and fewer breakdowns.</p>
      <p>The upgrades include converting the Trentham to Upper Hutt single track section to a double track, with a new signalling system, upgraded stations and level crossings, and a pedestrian underpass.</p>
      <p>Phil Twyford said rail is the backbone of a sustainable 21st Century transport network.</p>
      <p>“Improved reliability and more services will benefit the 20,000 Wellington commuters who take the train every weekday and encourage even more to get on board.</p>
      <p>“Not only does this help reduce emissions by getting cars off the road, it helps to ease congestion - which boosts the region’s productivity by $290 million every year.</p>
      <p>“Double tracking the rail line between Trentham and Upper Hutt has been talked about since the 1950s. Our Government is getting on with this important infrastructure upgrade,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
      <p>The 2.7km track between Trentham and Upper Hutt is a major bottle neck at an important point where commuter services and freight trains interact. These upgrades will help freight services to keep on time despite increased passenger services.</p>
      <p>Phil Twyford said the Government is getting rail back on track after years of neglect.</p>
      <p>“Our $196 million Wellington rail package also includes important upgrades for the Wairarapa line, without them, the line would have deteriorated with more and more disruptions to services.</p>
      <p>“While the previous government may have been okay letting Wellington’s rail network get this bad, it is simply unacceptable to our Government to do nothing.</p>
      <p>“We’re taking a long-term view and investing in rail around the country to get our cities moving, help transition to a zero-carbon economy and to support our regions,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
      <p>The Trentham to Upper Hutt work will finish in 2021 and the upgrades across the Wellington rail network and are funded with $193 million through the Transport Agency and $3 million from the Greater Wellington Regional Council.</p>
