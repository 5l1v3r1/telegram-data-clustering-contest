      <h1>New Mercedes-Benz GLA: fresh sketch drops ahead of full reveal…</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:55:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.carmag.co.za/author/ryanbubear/" target="_blank">Ryan Bubear</a></address>
      <p>Mercedes-Benz has released a sketch of its new GLA ahead of the second-generation model's full reveal on 11 December.</p>
      <p>Published across its various social media channels, the sketch depicts the new GLA from a rear three-quarter angle, and follows two earlier teasers (one showing the new model’s <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-mercedes-benz-gla-teaser-image-drops-along-with-initial-details/">silhouette</a> and the other giving us a glimpse of its <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/mercedes-benz-teases-the-new-glas-cabin/">cabin</a>).</p>
      <p>The latest sketch provides us with an idea of the second-generation GLA’s exterior styling, which includes a rising beltline and a new rear lighting signature (we’re going to ignore the impossibly large alloy wheels).</p>
      <p>The Stuttgart-based firm – which earlier confirmed the height of the new GLA would exceed that of its predecessor by more than 100 mm despite the vehicle’s overall length shrinking by 15 mm – promised the newcomer would boast “more character, more space and more safety” than the outgoing model.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the new GLA’s unveiling will be a purely digital world premiere, the first time Mercedes-Benz has taken such an approach.</p>
