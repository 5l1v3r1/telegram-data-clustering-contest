        <b>Bluebird bio’s gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD), LentiGlobin, has demonstrated significant benefit in a small group of patients treated in a phase 1/2 study. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Hot-on-the-heels of Bluebird’s approval for its groundbreaking beta thalassaemia gene therapy <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/a_first_for_bluebird_and_europe_as_gene_therapy_zynteglo_approved_1289724">Zynteglo</a> (autologous CD34+ cells encoding βA-T87Q-globin gene), the biotech has revealed new data for its SCD gene therapy LentiGlobin.</p>
      <p>LentiGlobin is designed to add functional copies of a modified form of the β-globin gene, which does not work as it should in SCD sufferers, into a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells. When patients have copies of the functional gene, their red blood cells can produce anti-sickling haemoglobin which decreases the amount of the faulty sickled haemoglobin.</p>
      <p>The results from the ongoing phase 1/2 HGB-206 study were presented at ASH 2019, and included additional patients treated and updated data from the pivotal trial.</p>
      <p>The updated data includes findings from 17 patients treated with LentiGlobin over 21 months – the results were promising, with none of those who previously suffered from pain attacks experiencing any while receiving the therapy. Over 40% of haemoglobin present in the treated patients red blood cells were found to be the healthier form (anti-sickling haemoglobin) thanks to the effects of the gene therapy.</p>
      <p>Out of the 17 treated, nine patients with at least six or more months of follow-up who had experienced at least four vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) or acute chest syndrome (ACS) events in the two years prior to treatment with LentiGlobin, experienced a 99% reduction in the annualised rate of these events.</p>
      <p>There was also no reports of either VOC or ACS events up to 21 months post-infusion.</p>
      <p>“The data continues to demonstrate sustained expression of gene therapy-derived haemoglobin in patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD, which resulted in significantly improved haemoglobin (&gt;2g/dl/patient), near-normalisation of markers of hemolysis and no reports of acute chest syndrome, stroke or serious vaso-occlusive crises in these patients,” said Julie Kanter, University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p>
      <p>The LentiGlobin data is impressive, but Bluebird is not alone in the sickle cell market, with a number of other therapies for the disease also emerging.</p>
      <p>This includes Global Blood Therapeutics’ <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/fda_backs_gbts_sickle_cell_drug_oxbryta_1318186">Oxbryta</a> (voxelotor), which recently won FDA approval for the treatment of SCD in patients aged 12 and over.</p>
      <p>The FDA also cleared Novartis’ anti-P-selectin antibody <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/fda_starts_speedy_review_of_novartis_sickle_cell_antibody_1294611">Adakveo</a> (crizanlizumab) to reduce VOCs – one of the most serious complications of SCD.</p>
      <p>Bluebird’s own <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/bluebird_puts_1.57m_price_on_gene_therapy_zynteglo_1291433">Zynteglo</a> is also in late-stage development for SCD, which could help it to secure a more dominant space in the market.</p>
      <p>On the gene therapy front, Bluebird may face competition from <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/vertex_reveals_promising_data_from_first_crispr-treated_patients_1317564">Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics</a>, who recently penned a deal for the development of up to six gene therapies, including candidates for SCD and other haemoglobinopathies.</p>
      <p>The partners recently revealed initial positive data from the first two patients treated with the investigational CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing therapy CTX001. The two patients both had severe haemoglobinopathies, including severe SCD and transfusion-dependant beta thalassaemia.</p>
