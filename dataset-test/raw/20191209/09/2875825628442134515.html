      <h1>Conor McGregor UFC news: Notorious wants Jorge Masvidal fight, says Dana White</h1>
      <h2>The Crumlin fighter will make his long-awaited return against Cerrone on January 18</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:32:04+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/eamon-doggett/" target="_blank">Eamon Doggett</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor will turn his sights to Jorge Masvidal if he defeats Donald Cerrone in January.</p>
      <p>This is the according to UFC chief Dana White who has also not ruled out a rematch between <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/khabib-nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> in the new year.</p>
      <p>White told 101.6FM in Washington: "Conor has told me he definitely wants a fight with Masvidal, so we'll see what happens."</p>

      <p>McGregor will make his long-awaited return against Cerrone on January 18 - over a year since his loss to lightweight king Nurmagomedov in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>And White sees a scenario where the Crumlin man could get the rematch he craves against the Russian in 2020.</p>

      <p>"A couple of things have got to happen first; he's got to beat 'Cowboy' Cerrone which is a very tough fight, especially at 170 without 'Cowboy' having to cut weight.</p>
      <p>"Then Khabib has to beat Tony Ferguson. If both of those things happen then yeah I think we can make the rematch.</p>
      <p>"[McGregor] would rather take that fight right now and not fight 'Cowboy', he wants that fight really bad.</p>
      <p>"In reality, Rich, it would be the biggest pay per view ever in the history of the sport."</p>
