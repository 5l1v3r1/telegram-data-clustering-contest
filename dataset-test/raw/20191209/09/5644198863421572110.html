      <p>APIA, Samoa: A devastating measles outbreak continued to spread in Samoa, data released Monday (Dec 9) showed, as the death toll from the epidemic climbed to 70, mostly young children.</p>
      <p>Official figures showed there were 112 new cases in the 24 hours to Monday morning, despite a massive immunisation drive last week that saw the entire Pacific nation shut down for two days.</p>

      <p>The government said the mobile vaccination teams had succeeded in ensuring 90 per cent of the 200,000-strong population was immunised, up from about 30 per cent when the epidemic began in mid-October.</p>
      <p>However, the vaccine takes 10 to 14 days to take effect, meaning it is too early to say whether the outbreak has peaked.</p>
      <p>The total number of cases was 4,693, with 229 people currently in hospital, including 16 critically ill children.</p>
      <p>Infants are the most vulnerable to measles, which typically causes a rash and fever but can also lead to brain damage and death.</p>
      <p>Among the 70 dead, 61 are children aged four or under.</p>

      <p>Health authorities have blamed anti-vaxxers spreading conspiracy theories for the low immunisation rate that left Samoa's children so vulnerable to a measles outbreak.</p>
      <p>Outbreaks elsewhere in the Pacific, including Tonga, Fiji and American Samoa, have been easier to contain because of higher immunisation rates, with no deaths reported.</p>
