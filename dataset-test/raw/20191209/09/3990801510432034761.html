      <h1>OnePlus might finally introduce a mid-range phone next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:23:55+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author">Ivan Mehta</a></address>
      <p>OnePlus has increasingly grown every year with better and more flagship models. But with that growth, prices of their phones have increased too. The company hasn’t released a mid-range phone since launching <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2015/10/29/hands-on-with-the-oneplus-x-you-might-buy-it-but-it-wont-be-much-to-do-with-the-phone/">the OnePlus X in 2015</a>.</p>
      <p>However, this might change next year. A bunch of renders published by <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-8-lite-renders-design-punch-hole-display-camera/">91mobiles in partnership with OnLeaks</a> suggest the company will release a OnePlus 8 ‘lite’ in 2020.</p>
      <p>The renders indicate the phone will have a punch-hole display – 6.4-inch or 6.5-inch – on the front, and a dual-camera setup with a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor on the back.</p>

      <p>The report remarks the phone will have a USB-C port for charging, in-display fingerprint sensor to unlock the device, and no headphone jack.</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that the company’s ‘cheapest’ phone, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/05/31/first-impressions-the-oneplus-7-is-a-flagship-for-people-who-can-resist-the-pro/">the OnePlus 7</a>, this year cost more than $450. Its rival, Xiaomi, released a very competitive <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/09/27/the-redmi-k20-pro-is-my-favorite-ever-xiaomi-phone/">K20 Pro</a> with a price tag of under $400. So it won’t be surprising if OnePlus releases a sub-$400 phone the next year.</p>
      <p>It would be interesting to see if OnePlus will launch three models – the OnePlus 8 ‘lite’, the OnePlus 8, and the OnePlus 8 Pro – next year. With Realme rising in ranks, mid-range phone space is going to be really contentious.</p>
