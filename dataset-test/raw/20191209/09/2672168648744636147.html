      <p>Local residents are repairing an over-100-year-old monastery of Konbaung Era design in Aunglan Township, Magway Region, without harming the original architecture.</p>
      <p>The monastery, built under the reign of King Thibaw in Letplanhla Village, is being repaired under the permission of the Department of Archaeology and National Museums. </p>
      <p>"It is said that the abbot of this monastery was a novitiate together with King Thibaw. The monastery was built by the carpenters sent by the king. It is over 100 years old. Some parts of the building are in a state of ruin. This is why locals collected money to repair the monastery. Permission was sought from the department of archaeology and was granted permission. But there are rules and disciplines as well as dos and don'ts in order not to harm the original style in repair work," said the current abbot. </p>
      <p>The ancient monastery is built of teak. The top of the roofing is designed with floral arabesques. There are also ancient cultural inscriptions and statues in the monastery.   </p>
