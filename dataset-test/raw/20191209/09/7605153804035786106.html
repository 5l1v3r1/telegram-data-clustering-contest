        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec 9 – Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s troubled past haunted him on Monday, after the prosecution heavily relied on it to argue its case in opposing his bail or bond in a corruption case in which he denied more than 30 counts in a Sh357 million scandal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The state specifically cited a case in which the governor escaped from Shimo La Tewa Maximum prison in Mombasa, more than a decade ago, portraying him as a dangerous person.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Prosecutors handling his case also told a magistrate’s court that Sonko has a pending criminal case that has stalled “because he has refused to present himself.”</p>
      <p>Already, the prosecution said, a warrant of arrest has since been issued by a Magistrate’s court in Mombasa.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the prosecution argued, if he is released on bail, “Sonko is likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.”</p>
      <p>“If released on bail or bond there is a high likelihood that he will interfere and intimidate witnesses who are junior officers and employees of Nairobi County Government,” a state prosecutor submitted, after Sonko denied corruption-related charges including money laundering and bribery.</p>
      <p>They accused the Governor of using his position to stop his staff against recording statements in the ongoing investigations and as such “releasing him will jeopardize investigations.”</p>
      <p>The prosecution further tightened the noose on Sonko by claiming he has threatened Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officers during the course of investigations.</p>
      <p>“Releasing him will impede or interfere with the ongoing probe,” the court heard.</p>
      <p>The prosecution also said he is a flight risk.</p>
      <p>Among the stringent demands by the prosecution includes barring the Governor from accessing his office, submitting his passports and any other traveling documents.</p>
      <p>His lawyers led by Cecil Miller were mounting a defence to try secure his release on bail.</p>
