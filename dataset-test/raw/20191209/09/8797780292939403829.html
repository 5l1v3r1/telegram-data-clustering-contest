      <p>Jesus! Arguably the first chronicles of a superhero, the bible is basically the original comic book minus the fancy pictures. Starring the son of an omniscient creator of the universe, Jesus has all the hallmarks of a caped crusader that set the benchmark for fiction over the centuries to come: An exotic array of powers chalked up to miracles, a good heart and his own sense of style that set him apart from the flock. He totally had a cape.</p>
      <p>There’s been no shortage of video games starring the Super-Messiah over the years (And a disgusting lack of games starring that other fella Brian who is not the Messiah but a very naughty boy), but few have attempted to put a <i>realistic </i>spin on the man of miracles. Realistic gameplay such as healing the sick, feeding the hungry and going toe to toe with the almighty Satan in the very depths of hell as you toss bolts of pure Christianity at a demon that looks like it’s still pissed off that it got beat in a rock-off by Tenacious D.</p>
      <p>Here’s the first trailer for it, oh true believers:</p>

Get into old times and follow the same path of Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago. Game is covering the period from Baptizing of Jesus Christ and to Resurrection.

      <p>Well alright then. According to developer SimulaM, this simulator will allow you to perform around 30 miracles, although none of them will help you shake the feeling that you’re watching the equivalent of a CSI: Miami episode on video games. Or a low budget Doctor Strange virtual reality game.</p>
