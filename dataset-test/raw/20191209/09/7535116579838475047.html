      <p>Is it really a safe world for women out there? We read news and hear stories almost daily from all the women out there about the harassment that happens to them just when they step outside. The worst part? It’s just creepy how some perverted men stalk and prey on innocent women. One such terrifying incident happened to this girl during her journey in the train.</p>
      <p>Twitter user @mvddoxrebel shared a tweet about her experience where she went on a train ride and was sitting beside a random guy. To her horror, the random guy messaged her on Whatsapp right after he got out of the train and used her actual name. Bear in mind, she didn’t even SPEAK to him nor did she give him her number.</p>

      <p>You can see in the messages how the guy doesn’t seem to find what he did creepy at all and was messaging her like he was messaging an old friend. The question still stands as to how this creepo got her number without even speaking to her! Many netizens advised her to immediately block the guy’s number as we don’t know what kinds of acts these men are capable of.</p>
      <p>
        <i>We hope she stays safe and reported this pervert’s number. To creepy men out there, just stop! If you think this is “game”, maybe actually consult women and before you pull these stunts.</i>
