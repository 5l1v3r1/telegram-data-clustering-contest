      <h1>Get started with Collections in Microsoft Edge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:07:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:07</time> by <a rel="author">Microsoft Edge Team</a></address>
      <p>We’re excited to announce that Collections is now enabled by default for all <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/">Microsoft Edge Insiders</a> in the <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/">Canary and Dev channels</a> (build 80.0.338.0 or later). Following <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2019/08/20/collections-now-available-microsoft-edge-preview/">our initial preview behind a feature flag</a> two months ago, we have been adding in new features and functionality. For those who enabled the feature flag – thank you! We have been listening to your feedback and are excited to share the improvements we’ve made.</p>
      <p>We designed Collections based on what you do on the web. If you’re a shopper, it will help you collect and compare items. If you’re an event or trip organizer, Collections will help pull together all your trip or event information as well as ideas to make your event or trip a success. If you’re a teacher or student, it will help you organize your web research and create your lesson plans or reports. Whatever you are doing on the web, Collections can help.</p>
      <h3>Recent improvements to Collections</h3>
      <p>We’ve been working hard to add more functionality and refine the feature over the last couple months – some of which were directly informed by your feedback.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the improvements we made, based on your input:</p>
      <p><b>Access your collections across your devices: </b>We’ve added sync to Collections. We know some of you have seen issues around sync, your feedback has been helping us improve. We know this is an important scenario and are ready for you to try it. When you are signed into Microsoft Edge preview builds with the same profile on different computers, Collections will sync between them.</p>
      <p><b>Open all links in a collection into a new window: </b>We’ve heard you’d like an easy way to open all sites saved in a collection. Try out “Open all” from the “Sharing and more” menu to open tabs in a new window, or from the context menu on a collection to open them as tabs in the current window so you can easily pick up where you left off. We’ve also heard that you want an easy way to save a group of tabs to a collection. This is something that we are actively working on and are excited to share when it is ready.</p>
      <p><b>Edit card titles</b>: You’ve been asking for the ability to rename the titles of items in collections, so they are easier for you to understand. Now you can. To edit a title, right click and choose “Edit” from the context menu. A dialog will appear giving you the ability to rename the title.</p>
      <p><b>Dark theme in Collections: </b>We know you love dark theme, and we want to make sure we provide a great experience in Collections. We’ve heard some feedback on notes which we’ve addressed. Try it out and let us know what you think.</p>
      <p><b> “Try Collections” flyout:</b> We understand that if you’re an active user of Collections that we were showing you the “Try Collections” flyout even though you previously used the feature. We’ve now tuned the flyout to be quieter.</p>
      <p><b>Sharing a collection: </b>You’ve told us that once you’ve collected content you want to share it with others. We have lots of work planned to better support sharing scenarios. One way you can share today is through the “Copy all” option added to the “Sharing and more” menu, or by selecting individual items and copying them via the “Copy” button in the toolbar.</p>

      <p>Once you’ve copied items from your Collection, you can then paste them into your favorite apps, like OneNote or Email. If you are pasting into an app that supports HTML you will get a rich copy of the content.</p>

      <h3>Try out Collections</h3>
      <p>You can get started by opening the Collections pane from the button next to the address bar.</p>
      <p>When you open the Collections pane, select Start new collection and give it a name. As you browse, you can start to add content related to your collection.</p>

      <h3>Send Feedback</h3>
      <p>Now that we’re on by default, we hope that more of you will give us a try. Thank you again to all of you that have been using the feature and sending us feedback. If you think something’s not working right, or if there’s some capability you’d like to see added, please send us feedback using the smiley face icon in the top right corner of the browser.</p>
