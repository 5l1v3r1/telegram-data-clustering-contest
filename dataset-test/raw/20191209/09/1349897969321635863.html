      <ul>
        <li>The Blaugrana have now won their group on 20 occasions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Barcelona have once again qualified from their Champions League group as group winners. This season, in addition, they have managed to do it in what was dubbed one of the more difficult groups. However, they have overcome Inter, Borussia Dortmund and Slavia Prague, who have been the surprise package despite exiting the competition early. </p>
      <p>Barça booked their place in the last 16 in their fifth game out of six, beating Borussia Dortmund to also confirm themselves as one of the seeds in the next round. As group winners, they will have the second leg at home and will play one of the teams that finishes second. That mean they avoid the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Juventus and Bayern Munich. They also can't draw any Spanish teams yet. </p>
      <p>As was the case last season, Ernesto Valverde's side have nothing to play for in their final game at Inter on Tuesday. The coach, therefore, can take advantage of the situation by making changes with tough games coming up away against Real Sociedad and at home to Real Madrid in the next nine days. </p>
      <p>Winning the group has become a habit for Barcelona. They have now managed to do so 20 times, four more than Real Madrid and five more than Manchester United and Bayern Munich. They also have the record for progressing from the group unbeaten, as well: 12 times, four more than Madrid. </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, against Inter, Barça can play without fear, knowing that they have already done their job. </p>
