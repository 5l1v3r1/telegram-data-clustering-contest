      <h1>Coal Scam: SC Asks SG To Suggest Names To Replace Special Prosecutor</h1>

      <p>The Supreme Court on Monday did not take kindly to the ED's request for changing certain investigating officers associated with the Coal-gate scam.</p>
      <p>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had sought permission to repatriate these officers to their home-states on account of their "personal issues", advancing that they were anyway on deputation.</p>
      <p>'Is deputation a punishment? They can resolve (their problems) and return...when the probe is underway, to change the officers would be against the basic principle...', Chief Justice S. A. Bobde took a prima facie view.</p>
      <p>The SG agreed to enquire into the status of the investigation, seek instructions and report back to the court.</p>
      <p>Further, the bench asked the SG and Senior Advocate R. S. Cheema, who has been the Special Public Prosecutor on the ED's cases, to suggest ideal names in lieu of Mr. Cheema, the latter having expressed a desire to withdraw from the responsibility.</p>
      <p>The investigation against former CBI Chief Ranjit Sinha, for manipulating the probe in the coal-block allocation scam, having been almost completed, the court adjourned the matters to be heard in February when the CBI shall file its report.</p>
