      <h1>Gender neutral debate after mum slammed for calling Santa 'Father Christmas'</h1>
      <h2>The mum said she was 'shamed' on social media for not using a gender neutral term</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:49:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:49</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Dowrick, Sarah McGee</a></address>
      <p>A Plymouth mum took to a social media group to discuss a children's Christmas book, but was "shamed" in the comments for failing to give Santa a gender neutral name.</p>
      <p>She referred to the jolly Christmas figure as 'Father Christmas' but many people criticised her, saying that 'Santa' is the preferred gender neutral term.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/mum-shamed-calling-santa-father-3615725">Plymouth Live,</a> the anonymous parent said she feels "on edge"' since posting in the group, saying she doesn't want to offend anybody by saying 'Father Christmas'.</p>
      <p>The mum said: "I've just been shamed [on a Facebook group] for using the name 'Father Christmas' and [told] that 'Santa' is now seen as gender neutral.</p>
      <p>"I was only referring to the book ['Father Christmas' by Raymond Briggs] but it's left me a little confused/on edge about what we are allowed to say.</p>
      <p>"I have a small child and don't really want to raise him saying 'Father Christmas' if it's hurtful to some."</p>
      <p>'Santa'/ Santa Claus' and 'Father Christmas' are arguably the most common names in the UK for the jolly person in red, while 'Saint Nick/Saint Nicholas' is used in other parts of the world.</p>
      <p>In France, they are called 'Pere Noel', similar to Italy's 'Babbo Natale' which both translate to 'Father Christmas'.</p>
      <p>In Germany the common term is 'Weihnachtsmann' (Christmas Man) and in Hungary and Poland it's 'Mikulas' and 'Mikolaj', both of which translate to [St] Nicholas.</p>
      <p>In Russia, the name 'Ded Moroz' translates as 'Grandfather Frost'.</p>
      <p>While many of these terms allude to Santa being a masculine figure, UK parents have weighed in on the debate with some parents calling for a gender neutral change.</p>
      <h3>'This gender neutral stuff is way out of hand'</h3>
      <p>One mum said: "It's always a man,</p>
      <p>"Santa is so American, Father Christmas here and will always be Father Christmas."</p>
      <p>Another dad agreed, saying: "It is Father Christmas, we are English not American! This gender neutral stuff is way out of hand."</p>
      <p>One mum said: "Father Christmas is fine! We have always used that in our family!! Use what YOU want."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Carry on calling him Father Christmas, it's your choice."</p>
      <p>However, some parents disagreed with one saying: "I must be the only one who hates 'Father Christmas', I much prefer 'Santa/Santa Claus,</p>
      <p>"plus it's easier for littlies to say."</p>
      <p>Other people noted that LGBTQ+ community did not seem to be offended by the masculine pronoun and aren't asking for the name to be changed.</p>
