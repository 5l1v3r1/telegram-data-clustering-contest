      <p>The huge impact of two Manchester charities was put centre stage as they received a share of £25,000.</p>
      <p>Representatives from homelessness charity Big Change and the We Love MCR Charity were recently invited to attend Manchester’s full Council meeting.</p>
      <p>They were there to receive a cheque for more than £25,000, raised earlier in the year when councillors and council staff took on the Three Peaks Challenge.</p>
      <p>The efforts of both charities are well known, and greatly appreciated throughout the city.</p>
      <p>For years they have tirelessly worked to raise money and awareness to support people in Manchester who need a helping hand.</p>
      <p>Big Change was set up as a local charity to support local people.</p>
      <p>Since it was set up it has raised tens of thousands of pounds to support the homeless community in the city.</p>
      <p>Funded through small donations made by members of the public, it has been able to make a huge difference in the lives of people who have fallen on hard times. </p>
      <p>Stephanie Moore, board member for Big Change Manchester, said: “Big Change is the Manchester charity here to support Manchester people.</p>
      <p>"Whether it is helping someone get together a deposit for a flat, to an outfit to wear for an interview, a huge difference is being made thanks to the public’s generosity.</p>
      <p>"This generous donation will go a long way to helping us pull people out of homelessness, and into a better life."</p>
      <p>For the We Love MCR Charity, this donation will allow them to continue helping young people in Manchester, and give everyone the power to make positive changes in their communities.</p>
      <p>Ged Carter, We Love MCR charity development manager, said: "I am beyond proud to have been part of the group which took on this incredibly tough challenge.</p>
      <p>"The money raised for We Love MCR Charity will go a huge way to supporting the young people of Manchester to achieve the potential we all know they have.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank everyone who took part in this challenge, and especially give thanks to the people who made a donation. You really have made a huge difference."</p>
      <p>The money raised through the Three Peaks Challenge will be split between both charities.</p>
