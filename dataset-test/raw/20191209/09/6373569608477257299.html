      <p>Plymouth Argyle striker Alex Fletcher was named man-of-the-match when he made his debut for Tiverton Town.</p>
      <p>Fletcher and another young Pilgrims’ professional, defender Mike Peck, completed one-month loan moves to the Southern League Premier South side on Saturday.</p>
      <p>They went straight into Tiverton’s squad for their away game against Harrow Borough and both played a part in a 5-1 win.</p>
      <p>Fletcher played the whole match, setting up Josh Key for Town’s 10th minute opening goal after some excellent play on the right and then a pinpoint cross.</p>
      <p>Peck, meanwhile, came off the bench as a 70th minute substitute.</p>
      <p>Former Pilgrims’ midfielder River Allen netted twice for Tiverton, who are third in the table and host second-placed Chesham United at Ladysmead on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>This is the second one-month loan spells of the season for 20-year-old Fletcher and Peck, 18.</p>
      <p>Fletcher made six appearances for National League club Aldershot while Peck played three times for Dorchester Town.</p>
      <p>Two more teenage Argyle professionals remain on loan to Dorchester, who parted company with manager Callum Brooks after a 3-0 home defeat by Metropolitan Police on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That result left Dorchester 21st in the Southern League Premier South, one off the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>Striker Klaidi Lolos played the whole match for the Magpies while midfielder Tom Purrington was substituted in the 78th minute.</p>
      <p>Purrington had scored a hat-trick when Dorchester won 7-0 at home to Hamworthy United in the Dorset Senior Cup quarter-finals last week.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Argyle pair Luke Jephcott and Ryan Law were both second half substitutes for Truro City in their 5-1 home defeat of Walton Casuals.</p>
      <p>Paul Wotton’s side remained top of the table in the Southern League Premier South after their 13th win in 18 games this season.</p>
      <p>Left-back Law and striker Jephcott replaced former Pilgrims’ pair Rio Garside and Alex Battle respectively in the 61st minute of the match at Treyew Road.</p>
      <p>Ex-Argyle striker Tyler Harvey completed a hat-trick for the White Tigers while Battle was also on target.</p>
