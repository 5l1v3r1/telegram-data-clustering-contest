      <p>Catholic prelates welcomed the appointment of Cardinal Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle of Manila to a Vatican post, saying it was a “blessing” to our country.</p>

      <p>“For his appointment, we glorify our God, we are grateful to His Holiness,” Bishop Ruperto Santos of Balanga said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“It is an immense blessing to our country, overflowing grace to His Eminence,” he added.</p>
      <p>His appointment, Santos said, showed the trust and confidence of Pope Francis on Cardinal Tagle.</p>
      <p>“He makes us proud as Filipinos, and our country as beacon for new Evangelization,” he said.</p>
      <p>Santos assured the cardinal of their collaboration and services.</p>
      <p>Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo also welcomed the appointment of Tagle as the country will again have a Filipino cardinal working in the Vatican.</p>
      <p>“That would be good. We have again a Filipino Cardinal who is working in the Vatican. He can bring his wisdom to the work of evangelization,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We wish him success in this heavy responsibility and we pray for him,” added Pabillo.</p>
      <p>The Vatican announced the appointment of Tagle as the new Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It is still unclear if the cardinal will have to leave his post as archbishop of Manila since members of the Roman Curia are usually based in Rome.</p>
      <p>Cubao Bishop Honesto Ongtioco, meantime, explained that as servants of the Church, they are always ready to go where they are assigned by the Holy Father.</p>
      <p>“We obey and we know the Lord will give us strength and graces plus heavenly wisdom,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Archdiocese of Manila is expected to release a statement on the appointment, Monday.</p>
