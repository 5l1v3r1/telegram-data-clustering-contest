      <p>A huge financial scandal has hit the Northern Regional Coordinating Council (NRCC) involving an official with the bursary department who is alleged to have diverted over hundred thousand Ghana cedis into his personal account through fraudulent means.</p>
      <p>Baba Osman Daney, 45, who is at the centre of the scandal, has since been transferred from the unit and according to a provisional charge sheet sighted by this portal faces charges of forgery, contrary to section 158 of the criminal offences code act 1960 (Act 29), stealing contrary to section 124(1) of the criminal offences act and corruption of public officers, could soon be arraigned before court.</p>
      <p>According to the statement of offence, the civil servant who is under the direct supervision of the Controller and Accountant General’s Department in October 2019 forged four bank cheques of the Northern Regional Coordinating Council and withdrew the total sum of GH¢119,423.60.</p>
      <p>The amount according to officials of the NRCC who lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Ghana Police Service was not sanctioned by them and therefore demanded a thorough investigation be conducted into the incident.</p>
      <p>According to official sources at NRCC, the Chief Director travelled and as a result directed the Regional Economic Planning Officer to act on his behalf. For avoidance of doubts, the officer in Charge of the Regional Economic Unit insisted on checking the balance in the accounts together with the Chief Director before accepting the caretaker’s responsibility.</p>
      <p>Upon the return of the Chief Director, the planner decided to recheck the account balance before handling over. He, however, discovered a drastic reduction in the accounts, even though he had not approved for or authorized any cash withdrawal while the Chief Director was away.</p>
      <p>Already, the main signatories to the NRCC accounts had been the Regional Accountant (Baba Daney) and the Chief Director so the Regional Economic Planner in high suspicion questioned the accountant.</p>
      <p>After failing to mount any clever defence, Baba Daney allegedly admitted his guilt. He reportedly confirmed making four different withdrawals without the knowledge of the Planning Officer.</p>
      <p>Police sources that pleaded strict anonymity, corroborate findings that there is pressure for the case to be swept under the carpet with the suspect currently on bail, freed and not be arraigned before court as planned.</p>
      <p>Mr. Daney who is believed to have involved himself in similar financial scandals or stealing of public funds previously during his time as District Accountant for Gushegu, Zabzugu, Tolon and Savelugu, allegedly forged the signature of the Chief Director of the Northern Regional Coordinating Council Investigations, however, reveal that there are attempts by some power brokers to conceal the matter as the person involved is said to be a member of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) who is also eyeing the parliamentary seat in the Yendi Constituency of the Northern Region.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, sources at the Northern Regional Coordinating Council indicate that there have been attempts by Baba Osman Daney to pay back the amount in order not to be hauled before court.</p>
