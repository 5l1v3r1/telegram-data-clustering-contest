      <p>The two sides meet in a Central League Cup group game, with the fixture kicking off at 1pm tomorrow at Fleetwood's Poolfoot Farm training ground.</p>
      <p>Former Seasider Stephen Crainey, now part of Fleetwood's academy, is to lead a development squad.</p>
      <p>Grayson, meanwhile, suggested some of his fringe first-team players might see some action to give them some vital minutes ahead of the busy festive schedule.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s going to be a busy period coming up, but as you can imagine the players were buoyant in the changing room after the Fleetwood game.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going to be complacent or anything because it’s a tough run of games and we have to have players fit and available who haven’t been playing much.</p>
      <p>“Some of them will play against Fleetwood on Tuesday in the reserve game because we’re going to need everybody over the next three weeks with so many games coming up.”</p>
      <p>Both sides tasted defeat in their opening Central League Cup group games, Fleetwood losing 4-3 to Wigan Athletic and Blackpool finding themselves on the wrong end of a 5-3 loss against Morecambe.</p>
      <p>Supporters of both clubs are welcome to attend.</p>
