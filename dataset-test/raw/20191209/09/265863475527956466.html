      <h1>Jordyn Woods Makes Fun Of Khloe Kardashian After Recent Social Media Meltdown Over Tristan Thompson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:37:23+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:37</time> by <a rel="author">Mel Walker</a></address>
      <p>Khloe Kardashian is trying to get rid of all the garbage in her life, and she recently made some dramatic posts on social media, where she claimed to have forgiven everyone that had ever wronged her.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star said in part: “It’s for anyone else who has ever hurt me. For some reason, people want to assume that I’m talking only about Tristan. This message applies to ALL parties involved in situations that have ever hurt me. Men, friends, family, work associates… anyone who played a role in my pain. I have moved on, found forgiveness and wish you only happiness and joy!”</p>
      <p>And while most people were impressed with her display and cheered her on, some have been far less positive about her attitude, and have taken to social media to call her out.</p>

      <p>More specifically, Jordyn Woods was seemingly unimpressed with what was going on, which should hardly be surprising considering the colossal scandal between her, Tristan Thompson, and Kardashian.</p>

      <p>The situation with the love triangle is far from over — or at least the fallout from the whole scandal is still fresh in many people’s minds, from what it seems.</p>
      <p>Many were hurt by what happened, and it does not seem like this will change anytime soon.</p>

      <p>And it seems like Woods is not going to let the situation slip out of her control, as she has been determined to set the record straight on every occasion that has come up so far.</p>

      <p>Woods responded by: “Someone somewhere is still discussing the old you because they don’t have access to the new you. Not every quote that is posted is a sub or a ‘clap back’ and not everything posted is directed towards one person in general. I deal with a lot of different s–t daily. It’s all love. Only positive vibrations.”</p>

      <p>Some of her fans seem to be getting tired of the constant negative exchanges, while others have been more supportive of Woods in her struggle.</p>

      <p>In any case, there is no indication that Woods is going to have the same approach to the situation as Kardashian, and she is still in a much more aggressive mood overall.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, there is some peaceful resolution in the end.</p>
