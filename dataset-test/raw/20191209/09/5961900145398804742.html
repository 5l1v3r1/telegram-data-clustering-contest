      <h1>NZ Police Confirm 5 Dead In Volcanic Eruption With “At Least A Double Digit” Still Missing</h1>

      <p>Five people have been confirmed dead as a result of a volcanic eruption on New Zealand’s Whakaari/White Island on Monday afternoon, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/dec/09/new-zealand-volcano-tourists-injured-and-missing-after-eruption-on-white-island-live"><b>The Guardian</b></a> reports. This number is expected to rise in the coming hours as police and rescue workers further investigate the scene.</p>
      <p>Whakaari Island, which is known as New Zealand’s “most active volcano” erupted at around 2.15pm local time on Monday.</p>

      <p>It was initially believed that up to 100 people were on the island at the time of the blast however, New Zealand Police later clarified that fewer than 50 people were in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>According to The Guardian, more than 20 of the people on the island at the time of the blast were Australian.</p>
      <p>23 people have been taken to shore and treated for injuries, but it is believed that up to 27 more people remain on the island.</p>
      <p>“A number of other people have been taken to hospital. A number of people have burns as a result of the eruption. It is still too early for police to confirm how many people are involved…including how many are still on the island,” Police deputy commissioner <b>John Tims </b>said in a press conference.</p>
      <p>Due to the severity of the eruption, police and rescue workers have not been able to access the island, meaning they are unable to confirm exactly how many people remain on the island, or their condition.</p>
      <p>“The physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island.”</p>
      <p>The deputy commissioner was able to confirm that “at least a double digit number of people remain on the island,” but due to the nature of the current conditions, was unable to be more specific.</p>
      <p>Footage and photographs of the eruption appear to show the wreckage of a helicopter on the island’s shore, however, this is yet to be confirmed by authorities.</p>
      <p>Police are currently on the shore of the island, and – conditions permitting – will seek to investigate the mainland.</p>
