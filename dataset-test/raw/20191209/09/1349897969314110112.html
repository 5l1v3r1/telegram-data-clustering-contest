      <ul>
        <li>The Argentine has hit top gear after an injury-hit start to the campaign</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With just nine days to go until the Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid at Camp Nou, Zinedine Zidane has become obsessed with how to stop Lionel Messi. </p>
      <p>Messi has become a nightmare for any rival to deal with. Madrid are no different. With the first Clasico of the season on Dec. 18, Zidane has been dedicating large chunks of time to studying how to stop the Argentine. </p>
      <p>Barça's No.10 has returned to top form recently after an injury-hit start to the season -- scoring three against Mallorca and the winner against Atletico Madrid. </p>
      <p>Until now, opponents have tried everything, but Messi has always won. Especially when it comes to the Clasico, one of his favourite games. He's always motivated and, as revealed in AS on Monday, Madrid are aware that stopping him could hold the key to the game. </p>
      <p>Zidane doesn't want any more Messi surprises. Therefore, he's looking at what he can do to slow him down. Man marking? That could be a job for Fede Valverde, who's been one of Los Blancos' best players this season. </p>
      <p>Another option would be to turn to the centre-backs, as has been the case previously. Varane and Sergio Ramos would be tasked with controlling the Argentine's movements. </p>
      <p>Finally, Casemiro, who's a booking away from a ban with a tricky trip to Valencia to come first, could be another option. </p>
      <p>For now, Zidane's weighing up the alternatives, man-marking or zonal, but he's aware that whatever he does, stopping Messi is almost mission impossible. </p>
