      <p>New Delhi: ‘The people of Karnataka have ensured that the Congress or  the JD(S) will not be able to betray them.’ The words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi after BJP whisked of 12 seats of the 15 in the by poll elections   in Karnataka.  He said its message for all states that the public will punish those who go against the popular mandate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a rally in Jharkhand.</p>
      <p>To boost the victory, the rebel Congress and JD(S) candidates fielded in their successive constituencies, are the BJP winners.  Yediyurappa can retain power with a whopping majority in by polls.  BJP won twelve of the 15 seats in the by election.</p>
