      <p>A man is fighting for life after reportedly setting himself on fire outside a pub in London.</p>
      <p>Horrified drinkers and a bouncer came to the man's aid by putting out the flames after he reportedly set himself alight in Chislehurst on Sunday just before 9pm.</p>
      <p>Witnesses claim the man arrived at the Queen's Head pub with two petrol cans before he ignited himself in the car park.</p>
      <p>One told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10511267/man-sets-himself-on-fire-pub/">The Sun</a> : “There were two petrol cans in his bag and it started catching flame and I extinguished it, heart was racing.</p>
      <p>“If it wasn't for the quick action from three blokes in the pub and one of the bouncers ripping his burning clothes off and extinguishing him he would have been dead."</p>

      <p>One man who was at the scene said he spoke to three eye-witnesses who all reported the man had set himself alight, <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/man-rushed-hospital-after-setting-17385460">MyLondon reports</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: "I spoke with several eyewitness’s on the scene who told me what had happened 10 minutes previously although I didn’t witness it first hand.</p>
      <p>"The ambulance then drove towards Mottingham with a police escort (away from PRUH) so guessing it was towards a London hospital.</p>
      <p>"Although a friend who was driving up from Mottingham told me he saw a number of Air Ambulance support vehicles in Mottingham so the chap may have been flown out from somewhere."</p>
      <p>Police were forced to cordon off the scene resulting in road diversions in the area.</p>
      <p>Bromley Police tweeted: "We're being asked about road closures in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chiselhurst?src=hashtag_click">#Chiselhurst</a> .</p>
