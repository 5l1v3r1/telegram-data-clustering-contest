      <blockquote>Well, I thought it was pretty decent to be fair. Granted, I was only able to play a simple tutorial battle and then one more challenging battle (which, I was told, I was one of a select few in Gamescom to have actually beat it - I may play too many strategy games). I'm going to gloss over the tutorial because that's all it was, a basic intro, and get onto the meat of the game that I saw. Needless to say, BonusXP has certainly crafted a strong Turn-Based Tactics (TBT) title.</blockquote>
