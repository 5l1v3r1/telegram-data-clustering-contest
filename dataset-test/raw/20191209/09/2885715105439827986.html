      <p>Panipat is Kriti Sanon’s first historical film.</p>
      <p>Actor <a href="http://indianexpress.com/about/kriti-sanon/">Kriti Sanon</a> says it was nearly impossible for the team of Panipat to trim down its run-time because when one deals with history, it’s difficult to cut a lot of events.</p>
      <p>Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, Panipat released last Friday. The <a href="http://indianexpress.com/about/arjun-kapoor/">Arjun Kapoor</a>-Kriti starrer historical drama has a duration of nearly two hours fifty minutes.</p>
      <p>When pointed out that there has been some criticism with regards to its length, Kriti told reporters, “When you’re dealing with history, it’s difficult to cut a lot of things because you’ve to show facts. When there are a lot of characters, which there were in Panipat war, it takes time to establish them.”</p>
      <p>The actor said a period love story is comparatively easier to trim as the story revolves around just those characters.</p>
      <p>“The pace in historical, period films is always slow in the beginning, unless it’s a love story, which is easier with just a few characters and life revolving around them. Here, there’s so much that’s happening. I don’t think there was anything which we could’ve let go, which wasn’t important or relevant to the times,” the actor said at the red carpet of Star Screen Awards on Sunday.</p>
      <p>There were reports that Kriti might feature in Farah Khan’s Satte Pe Satta but the actor said, “I’d love to but there’s nothing that I know of, to be very honest.”</p>
      <p>“The year started with ‘Luka Chuppi’, then ‘Housefull 4’ and now ‘Panipat’ is getting such amazing reviews. I’ve been getting great response for my character and it took me a while to sink it in! Because it was my first historical, I wanted to make sure it’s convincing and people don’t see Kriti in it,” she added.</p>
