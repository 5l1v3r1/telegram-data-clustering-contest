      <p>The nature of Andrzej Sapkowski’s <i>Witcher</i> books being more focused on a collection of time-strewn short stories than it is actual linear novels makes the particular trial of adapting them for television a struggle. It was one Lauren Schmidt Hissrich wrangled with when she helped bring Geralt to life for Netflix—but we almost got a very different take on it.</p>
      <p>In an interview going behind the scenes on the upcoming fantasy series, Hissrich revealed that initially, she struggled to find a way to transform Sapkowski’s collections of short tales into a cohesive season of television. Jumping around <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/breaking-down-the-monsters-politics-and-bathtubs-of-the-witchers-latest-trailer">timelines and events</a> was less of a problem—she assumed modern TV viewers, at this point, are more than capable of dealing with non-linear narratives.</p>
      <p>Instead, her original problem was not wanting to spend significant periods of time getting to know <i>The Witcher</i>’s <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/10/netflixs-witcher-series-has-cast-2-of-its-most-important-female-characters">powerful female characters</a>, like Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) and Ciri (Freya Allan), solely through the lens of its male protagonist (Henry Cavill’s Geralt).</p>
      <p>“In the books, all of the characters are met through Geralt,” Hissrich said in footage of her speaking to fans at MCM London Comic-Con. “So you get Geralt’s impression of them, and <i>then</i> you get to learn, to meet them. I wanted the world to see Ciri, who she was, first.”</p>
      <p>And so, when Hissrich first started writing a pitch for <i>The Witcher</i> to send for Netflix, she started out with a version of the show radically different to what we ultimately got: instead of starting with the earliest of Sapkowski’s novels, she reached forward to the end.</p>

      <p>“I pitched [Netflix] a version of the story that actually started with the second-to-last book, which is <i>Lady of the Lake</i>,” Hissrich revealed. “...Ciri sort of ends up sitting by a lake, meeting with a man, and telling her story. And I started with that narrative structure, which is to have Ciri be our focal character, and be kind of our narrator.”</p>
      <p>But Hissrich found herself facing an inverse version of the problem she wanted to avoid. “I realised as I started writing that version, that I wasn’t getting enough of Geralt and his perspective, because it was all being told through Ciri,” Hissrich continued.</p>
      <p>“It took me a while. I went through several versions, and I literally had one of those ‘aha!’ moments in the shower, jumped out of the shower and said to my husband ‘does this make sense,’ can I tell all three of these stories at the same time and not have it be too confusing?”</p>
      <p>It won’t be much longer before we find out for ourselves if Hissrich succeeded at blending together Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer’s stories. But it’s interesting to hear that we almost got a version of <i>The Witcher</i> where the titular Witcher was not as forward in the narrative as we might have expected.</p>
      <p><i>The Witcher</i> hits Netflix on December 20.</p>
