      <p>A high-flying recruitment executive hanged himself four days before <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/christmas/index.html"><b>Christmas</b></a> after developing an <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/alcohol/index.html"><b>alcohol</b></a> problem while drinking socially with friends, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Steven Davis-D'Cruz, 39, earned £80,000 a year recruiting <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/nhs/index.html"><b>NHS</b></a> managers and was said to be 'the life and soul of any gathering' - but his social drinking escalated until he was consuming at least one bottle of wine a day.</p>
      <p>Although he was regarded as 'the Number One employee' at work, Mr Davis-D'Cruz would have drink fuelled rows with his husband Jason at home and then call his brother in a distressed state.</p>

        <figcaption>On December 21 last year, a month after seeing his GP about his 70 units a week alcohol consumption, Mr Davis-D'Cruz (left) was found dead by his husband at their shared property in Heaton Moor, near Stockport, Greater Manchester</figcaption>

      <p>On December 21 last year, a month after seeing his GP about his 70 units a week alcohol consumption, Mr Davis-D'Cruz was found dead by his husband at their shared property in Heaton Moor, near Stockport, Greater Manchester.</p>
      <p>There was so much alcohol in his system, a coroner said he may not have intended to take his own life.</p>
      <p>The Stockport hearing was told Mr Davis-D'Cruz, who worked in Manchester, had met his husband when interviewing him for a job in 2005 and they married in 2015.</p>
      <p>At the time of his death, he planning to see Cher in concert for his 40th birthday and the couple were planning trips to Paris or Australia.</p>
      <p>Jason, a marketing manager, told the inquest: 'Stevie was a very kind hearted person, talented and selfless and would always do more for others than for himself.</p>
      <p>'He was the life and soul of any gathering and he progressed through the ranks at works quite quickly.</p>

      </slideshow>
      <p>'Had been head hunted to help set up a health care division within the Manchester office and in the short time he was there he won everything.</p>
      <p>'He hit all targets and excelled and was classed as their 'Number One' employee when he passed away.</p>
      <p>'He was a perfectionist about his job and if he had a target he was focused on achieving that.</p>
      <p>'Alcohol was a very social thing, with friends or going to see family and it was not something I was worried about at the time and Stevie wasn't either.</p>
      <p>'But over the last couple of years it did become more challenging not just for him but me too.</p>
      <p>'There were more arguments, more drinking and whenever there was any kind of disagreement, drink was involved - like it often is for any couple.</p>
      <p>'It wasn't something that was detrimental to Stevie's ability to do his job and go to work.</p>

      <p>'But sometimes he could become a bit uncharacteristically pensive, sad and upset - although it was not always very clear what he was upset about.</p>
      <p>'He knew himself that he had to sort out the drinking and to a degree I had to do as well to be his husband and support him.'</p>
      <p>Jason added: 'Stevie was always someone who pushed himself. He was very responsible with his money and always planned ahead. In the days leading up to his death had gone down to London for a work meeting.</p>
      <p>'I wrote him a letter to tell him how much I loved him and he wrote a note back saying how much he loved me and how we're going to make 2019 our year because we deserve it.</p>
      <p>'Usually he would stay over in London with his friend but he wanted to come back home as he knew I needed the support still.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He attended a traditional Christmas get together with friends and then on December 20, we both went to work and we were in touch with each other by texting and email.</p>
      <p>He was messaging me that day looking forward to being together over Christmas.</p>
      <p>'Later we went to his mum's home had some drinks and she packed his dinner for him. We got home and Steven said he still wasn't feeling well and said he would eat upstairs in bed. I just said to him go have your dinner and I'll be up within the hour.'</p>
      <p>Jason fell asleep whilst watching TV then woke up at 3.30am and his husband when he went to bed.</p>
      <p>Mr Davis-D'Cruz's brother Simon Davis told the inquest: 'Stevie enjoyed life and lived it to its max every day. He was quite flamboyant earned around £80,000 a year had a good standard of living and went out for nice meals and drinks.</p>
      <p>'To be on alcohol wasn't something new in Stevie's life. Yes he drank, but when he would light up the room you wouldn't know whether he had a drink or not. He was able to control himself and seemed to develop a tolerance.</p>

        <figcaption>Tests showed Mr Davis-D'Cruz had 200 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood in his system. The alcohol limit for driving in blood is 80mg</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'They have got no children and he would drink as and when he felt like it.</p>
      <p>'He did drink a lot but never thought have any detrimental effect on him in terms of psychological state.</p>
      <p>'He was functioning, able to get up and go to work in a very demanding job.'</p>
      <p>Mr Davis added: 'He would tell me about his personal life how he was feeling and concerns how it made him feel. </p>
      <p>'He would ring me occasionally in a distressed state but over the last few months was ringing me more regularly.</p>
      <p>'He and Jason going through a difficult time. Jason had lost his brother and my brother was supporting him and I think Steve needed a little extra support from me. I would calm him down when he was feeling particularly anxious.'</p>
      <p>Mr Davis-D'Cruz's GP Dr Salim Shaikh said: 'I was the last doctor to see Steven on November 19, 2018.</p>
      <p>'He attended the surgery due a problem with drinking alcohol and he was having a bottle of wine daily.</p>
      <p>'I assessed him for symptoms of depression but he didn't have any. He denied having any thoughts or intention to harm himself.</p>
      <p>'He reported he did have arguments with his husband but still found him supportive. He was well kempt but sweating and little trembly [sic] and that maybe due to anxiety or alcohol related.</p>
      <p>'He requested anti depression tablets but I explained it was not the right treatment given the regular alcohol consumption. He was drinking at least 70 units of alcohol per week - 56 units more than the recommended intake.</p>
      <p>'I explained that alcohol is a depressant but he declined a referral to a community alcohol team.</p>
      <p>'I encouraged him to have counselling and asked to return to see me in two to four weeks. It seems used alcohol to cope with his social circumstances.'</p>
      <p>Tests showed Mr Davis-D'Cruz had 200 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood in his system. The alcohol limit for driving in blood is 80mg.</p>
      <p>Recording a narrative conclusion coroner Chris Morris said: 'Steven was somebody who was very popular, decent, and clever and with a kind heart and generous spirit.</p>
      <p>'He perhaps had been troubled more so than willing to share with those close to him and he had a consultation with a GP as levels of alcohol he regarded as problematic.</p>
      <p>'But I am not satisfied that he necessarily intended to bring about his death. There's an absence of anything clear and consented note of intent and I'm bound to reflect on the very high levels alcohol in his system which raises very significant question marks over his ability to form intent at that time.</p>
      <p>'He was somebody who had plans for his future and planning his holiday a concert and making plans for Christmas. Nobody has given any sign of concern about him about to end his life.'</p>
