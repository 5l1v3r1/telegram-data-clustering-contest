          <b>Roman Kemp finished in third place on last night's finale of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. </b>

      <p>Last night, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/jacqueline-jossa-crowned-winner-im-celeb-2019-346167"><i>Jacqueline Jossa</i></a> was crowned Queen of the Jungle. After three weeks of gruelling challenges, new friendships and a daily fight for food, the former EastEnders star came out on top.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline was then closely followed by Andy Whyment in second place and <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/roman-kemp-finishes-third-im-celeb-346165"><i>Roman Kemp</i></a> in third.</p>
      <p>Now, as they bid farewell to the Australian jungle and get ready to head back to life in the UK, it's going to be a busy couple of weeks for the stars of the show between TV appearances, interviews, events and coming to terms with their increased Instagram followers.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.agy47.com/"><i>AGY47</i></a>, a digital marketing agency that specialises in organic search, paid search and conversion rate optimisation, they studied the social media accounts of all the campmates to see what kind of money the stars would be making off their profiles since leaving the jungle - and the results are pretty interesting.</p>
      <p>Although Jacqueline Jossa won I'm A Celeb last night, surprisingly, she won't have the biggest jump in cost for a sponsored post. Now charging £9,524.56, this is only £1,496.64 more than she was previously charging.</p>
      <p>However, Roman Kemp on the other hand will see the biggest increase in fee. With an increase in almost half a million followers since entering the jungle, Roman's fee will double to £3,237.01, a £2,131.71 increase.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/calls-to-boycott-the-kardashians-after-caitlyn-jenners-elimination-346111"><i>Caitlyn Jenner</i></a>, still reigns as the I'm A Celeb star to make the most money from her social media platform. Outside the jungle, Caitlyn Jenner makes money from doing a hashtag SP and now, she'll make almost £2,000 more at £49,060.34 per cent per Instagram post.</p>
      <p>Other notable figure increases are Myles Stephenson and <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/nadine-coyles-sister-teases-potential-romance-nadine-myles-stephenson-345712"><i>Nadine Coyle</i></a>, both seeing an almost £1,000 increase in fee. Now they're both able to charge £2,753.89.</p>
