      <p>Five people were killed, 18 were injured and several more were left stranded after an island volcano popular with tourists erupted unexpectedly in New Zealand on Monday.</p>
      <p>Police said some 50 people were visiting White Island when it exploded suddenly in the early afternoon -- hurling ash and rock high into the air.</p>
      <p>Two dozen people made it off the island, five of whom have since died. The rest are being treated for injuries, including severe burns.</p>
      <p>Nothing is yet known about a group - now estimated to number in the double digits - who are still trapped on the island.</p>
      <p>"We're unsure of the exact numbers on there and we're unsure of their wellbeing," said deputy commissioner John Tims.</p>
      <p>As night fell, he said volcanic activity made a rescue attempt too dangerous.</p>
      <p>"The island is unstable, there's a danger of further eruptions, it is physically unsafe for us to return to the island"</p>
      <p>"I've got to consider the safety of our people and emergency services staff."</p>
      <p>The eruption occurred at 14:11, thrusting a thick plume of white ash 3.6 kilometres into the sky.</p>
      <p>Seconds before, live camera feeds showed a group of more than a half dozen people walking on the crater floor. Then the images went black.</p>
      <p>A "considerable number" of those caught up in the disaster are believed to be Australian, according to officials in Canberra.</p>
      <p>As many as 30 people are also believed to be cruise passengers on a day trip from the vessel Ovation of the Seas, Kevin O'Sullivan, chief executive officer of industry body the New Zealand Cruise Association told AFP.</p>
      <p>The ship's operator Royal Caribbean - who had billed the trip to White Island as "an unforgettable guided tour of New Zealand's most active volcano" - said "a number of our guests were touring the island" but did not confirm that number.</p>
      <p>The ship has a capacity of around 4 000 people and set sail from Sydney last week on a 12 day voyage.</p>

        <b>Scene of terror</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tourist Michael Schade, made it off the island just in time and was able to capture footage of the devastation.</p>
      <p>His videos showed groups of startled tourists clustered by the shoreline, waiting to be evacuated as the ground around them smouldered, the sky filled with white debris. An ash-caked helicopter lies damaged nearby.</p>
      <p>As his ship hurtled away, the caldera became virtually invisible, shrouded by a thick bank of ash.</p>
      <p>Volcanic Air said they had landed a helicopter on the island shortly before the eruption carrying four visitors and one pilot. All were now accounted for.</p>
      <p>"It had landed on the island. What happened after that we don't know, but we know that all five made it back to Whakatane on one of the tourist boats," a company spokesman told AFP.</p>
