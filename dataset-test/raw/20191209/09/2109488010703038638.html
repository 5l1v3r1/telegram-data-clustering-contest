      <h1>Beijing kicks overseas kit out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:32:30+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#kavitmajithia" target="_blank">Kavit Majithia</a></address>
      <p>China directed all government offices and public institutions to replace non-domestic computer equipment and software with home-grown alternatives within three years, <i>Financial Times </i>(<i>FT</i>) reported.</p>
      <p>The move is considered to be retaliation to a US government <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/huawei-lands-on-us-trade-blacklist/">export ban</a> on Huawei, and is tipped as a blow to companies including Microsoft, HP and Dell.</p>
      <p>Chinaâ€™s government issued the demand earlier this year, with the details only coming to light after employees from two cybersecurity companies told <i>FT</i> their clients had revealed the details.</p>
      <p>Beijing apparently set specific targets for the replacement of non-domestic technology, providing a boost to companies including Huawei and ZTE as they continue to face troubles in the US and other international markets.</p>
      <p>As well as banning Huawei from buying US-made equipment in May, the US government also embarked on an <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/deutsche-telekom-puts-5g-deals-on-hold/">international campaign</a> to press its allies to block the vendor from 5G rollouts on security grounds.</p>
      <p><b>Major programme<br/></b>Analysts at brokerage China Securities told <i>FT </i>between 20 million and 30 million pieces of hardware would have to be replaced as a result of the order, with around half the substitutions taking place in 2021.</p>
      <p>Government offices already use Lenovo desktop computers.</p>
      <p>Hardware, however, may not be the biggest challenge: many of the offices in question rely on Microsoft Windows or Apple macOS, which must be replaced with Chinese-developed operating systems.</p>
      <p>One known alternative is Kylin OS, but it is challenged by having a smaller pool of developers to produce software.</p>
