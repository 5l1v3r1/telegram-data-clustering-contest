      <h1>South Korea: Gov’t Seeks to Tax Crypto Transactions as Capital Gains</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/south-korea">South Korean</a> government plans to tax capital gains on cryptocurrency transactions. A Dec. 9 <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/12/367_279973.html">report</a> from The Korea Times reveals that a revised bill to introduce the measure will be drawn up by the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance by the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>In parallel, the Korean National Assembly is in the process of advancing a related bill aimed at increasing transparency in cryptocurrency trading. If passed, the new regulations would come into effect one year after the Assembly’s plenary session.</p>
      <p>While the government’s capital gains bill will reportedly go ahead regardless of related legislation, The Korea Times notes that a more adequate definition of cryptocurrencies and digital assets will be required to provide clarity for the government’s interventions. </p>
      <p>Among the matters to be clarified is the question of whether crypto-related gains are to be deemed similar to gains in stock trading or real estate transactions.</p>
      <p>To implement its taxation plans, the government could therefore need to obtain access to trading records on cryptocurrency exchanges — a practice already underway in countries such as the United States.</p>
      <h3>Anti-Money Laundering measures</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-to-bring-crypto-exchanges-under-direct-regulation">reported</a>, South Korea’s proposed Act on Reporting and Use of Certain Financial Transaction Information will, if passed, stipulate that banks must issue real-name accounts to crypto exchanges. This would ensure that crypto exchanges adhere to the same <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/kyc">Know Your Customer</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/aml">Anti-Money Laundering</a> standards as traditional financial institutions. </p>
      <p>This move to bring cryptocurrency exchanges under the direct regulation of the country’s watchdog, the Financial Services Commission, will also include introducing a crypto exchange licensing system, as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fatf-to-release-new-rules-for-global-crypto-sector-impacting-exchanges-funds-custodians">recommended</a> by the Financial Action Task Force (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fatf">FATF</a>).</p>
      <p>Major South Korean exchange Upbit, which is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-koreas-largest-multi-billion-dollar-conglomerates-enter-the-cryptocurrency-market">run</a> by a subsidiary of Korean tech giant Kakao, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-crypto-exchange-upbit-confirms-theft-of-342-000-ether-50m">revealed</a> last month that 342,000 Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>) had been stolen from its hot wallets. </p>
      <p>The thefts happened when the exchange was allegedly moving assets between its hot and cold storage facilities, sparking some <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/signs-point-to-inside-job-in-upbit-crypto-exchange-hack-says-commentator">speculation</a> that the incident may have been an inside job, rather than an external breach. Upbit has pledged to reimburse those affected from its corporate funds. </p>
      <p>Transfers of the ill-gotten assets have since been <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/upbit-hack-stolen-eth-worth-millions-on-the-move-to-unknown-wallets">detected</a> on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
