        <b>Second-graders help dogs in need</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jennie Warmouth’s second-grade class at Spruce Elementary in Lynnwood has been writing online descriptions for adoptable dogs for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>This year, her class took it a step further by organizing and promoting an eight-day fundraiser at their school.</p>
      <p>The drive culminated with the class presenting a $387.57 check to the CEO of PAWS, an animal shelter and adoption agency.</p>
      <p>The donation goes toward caring for dogs being transferred from shelters in Texas to the Northwest.</p>
      <p>“In Texas shelters, highly-adoptable dogs are at risk of being euthanized due to overcrowding,” a news release said. “In the Northwest, many shelters have room to accommodate these homeless animals due to high demand from our animal-loving community.”</p>
      <p>Those looking to donate to the cause can visit facebook.com/MiracleK9 or www.give.paws.org.</p>
