      <h3>BALER, Aurora - Eight high-powered firearms and assorted materiel belonging to a unit of the New People’s Army (NPA) were recovered Saturday in a joint Army-Police operation in barangay Punglo, Maria Aurora town.</h3>
      <p>“Among those recovered from the suspected firearms cache of Platoon Dos Kilusang Larangang Gerilya (KLG) Sierra Madre were 2 AK-47 assault rifles, 5 M-16 rifles, 1 M-14 rifle, 16 long magazine assembly for cal. 5.56/M-16, 15 short magazine assembly for cal. 5.56/M-16, 4 bandoliers and 150 cal. 5.56 live ammunition,” Army 703rd Brigade Commander Colonel Andrew D. Costelo disclosed.</p>
      <p>The recovery of these high-powered firearms and assorted materiel was made possible through the revelation of former rebel “Roel” who used to be a squad leader of the KLG Sierra Madre Platoon Uno operating in the provinces of Nueva Ecija and Aurora. They are now in the custody of 91st Infantry Battalion for proper disposition and documentation.</p>
      <p>“The Army and Police will continue to operationalize the government’s campaign to end local communist armed conflict. That is why I encourage the remaining members of the NPA to go back to the fold of law, start a new life and benefit from the services the government offers,” Costelo emphasized.</p>
