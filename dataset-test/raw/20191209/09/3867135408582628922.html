        <b>Sounder parking shortage</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sounder commuters at the Mukilteo Station may have found parking a bit more difficult Tuesday. Those challenges may continue during construction of the new WSDOT ferry terminal for the next six months. Twelve Sounder parking spots were temporarily relocated but were restored. Sound Transit said if the regular stalls are full, commuters should drive through to the front of the lot, loop around, and the new stalls will be on your right.</p>

        <b>Fire dangers</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Marysville Fire District will display wreaths at all five of its stations through New Year’s Day, to remind people about fire safety. Each wreath is covered in green bulbs that change to red when there’s a fire in the district, and to white when a firefighter dies in the line of duty in the United States.</p>
      <p>The wreathes are supposed to serve as a reminder to prevent fires during the holidays.</p>
      <p>The fire district gives these reminders:</p>
      <p>Stay in the kitchen while cooking. Christmas Eve and Christmas are two leading days when home fires are caused by unattended cooking.</p>
      <p>Put out candles when you leave the room or go to bed. Don’t place candles near decorations or other flammable items.</p>
      <p>Make sure Christmas trees are at least three feet away from any heat source.</p>
      <p>Always turn off the Christmas tree lights before leaving the house or going to bed.</p>
