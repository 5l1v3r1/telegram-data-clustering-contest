      <p>Tokyo (AP) — Stock markets weakened during European trading on Monday as investors weighed the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on China and the outlook for negotiations on the trade dispute.</p>
      <p>A Chinese official said that Beijing wants a prompt settlement of its trade war with Washington as another U.S. tariff hike on $160 billion of Chinese imports is due to take effect Sunday. China announced Friday it was carrying out a promise to waive punitive tariffs on American soybeans and pork.</p>
      <p>France's CAC 40 slipped 0.4% in midday trading to 5,850, while Germany's DAX declined 0.2% to 13,145. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.1% to 7,232.</p>
      <p>U.S. shares were set to drift slightly lower with Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures both falling less than 0.1%.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged 0.3% higher to finish at 23,430.70, after the Cabinet Office reported the economy expanded at a 1.8% annual pace in July-September, spurred by strong consumer purchases ahead of an Oct. 1 sales tax hike. That was much stronger than the 0.2% growth earlier reported and marked a fourth straight quarter of expansion for the world's No. 3 economy.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 added 0.3% to 6,730.00. S outh Korea's Kospi edged 0.3% higher to 2,088.65. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed, inching down to 26,494.73. The Shanghai Composite index rose nearly 0.1% to 2,914.48.</p>
      <p>The week got off to a strong start after the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 300 points on Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 erased losses from earlier in the week, nudging the benchmark index to a second consecutive weekly gain.</p>
      <p>A surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report for November put investors in a buying mood Friday on Wall Street, extending the market’s winning streak to a third day.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department said employers added 266,000 positions, well above estimates of 184,000. The report also showed unemployment falling to a 50-year low. Separately, an index that measures how consumers feel about the economy showed an increase from last month.</p>
      <p>In energy markets, the benchmark for crude oil lost 56 cents to $58.64 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It advanced 77 cents to $59.20 per barrel on Friday. Brent crude oil, the international standard for pricing, shed 59 cents to $63.80.</p>
      <p>In currencies, the dollar fell to 108.47 Japanese yen from 108.59 yen on Friday. The euro strengthened to $1.1077 from $1.1062.</p>
