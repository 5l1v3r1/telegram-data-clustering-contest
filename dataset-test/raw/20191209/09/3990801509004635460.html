      <p>Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Descartes used to say: Crack open this tasty lobster!</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin price</h3>
      <p>We closed the day, December 08 2019, at a price of $7,564. That’s a minor 0.17 percent increase in 24 hours, or $13. It was the highest closing price in seven days.</p>
      <p>We’re still 62 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin market cap</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $136,847,419,896. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin volume</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s volume of $15,409,908,086 was the lowest in four days, 6 percent below the year’s average, and 65 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 328 tons of gold.</p>

      <p>A total of 278,705 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 15 percent below the year’s average and 38 percent below the year’s high.</p>

      <p>Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.11. That’s $3.59 below the year’s high of $3.71.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin distribution by address</h3>
      <p>As of now, there are 11,407 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.0 percent, and the top 1000 34.9 percent.</p>

      <p>He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 95.0 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $152,805 by now, according to dickline.info.</p>
