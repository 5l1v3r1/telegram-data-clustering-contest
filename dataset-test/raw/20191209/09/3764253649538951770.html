      <p>Arsenal interim manager Freddie Ljungberg has exuded confidence the side can still make top four despite a poor run of results.</p>

      <p>However, Ljungberg has moved to assure his wards to maintain their eyes on the prize as he seeks to turn around the club's fortunes.</p>
      <p><i>"I don't think we should stop talking about the top four. But for us it's about concentrating on what we're doing now,"</i> the tactician insisted.</p>

      <p>Despite managing Arsenal for just two matches, the Swede boss has already attracted criticism, with a section of fans and pundits questioning if he is the right man for the job.</p>
      <p>But the former midfielder is backing himself to steady the ship at the Emirates and to get the north London outfit out of their malaise.</p>

      <p><i>"100 per cent, otherwise I wouldn't be here. Of course it will be difficult. When confidence is low, it's low. We're going to work trying to get that back,"</i> he said when asked if he has what it takes to return the club to winning ways.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal will be looking to make a good account of themselves when they take on struggling West Ham at the London Stadium on Monday night, December 9.</p>
