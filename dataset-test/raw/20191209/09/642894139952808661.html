      <p>Through First Distribution’s extensive African footprint, Veeam is now proudly available across SADC countries, as well as Central, East and West African countries.</p>

        <b>The First Distribution Veeam offering</b>
      </p>
      <p>Veeam recognises the new challenges companies across the globe face in enabling the Always-On Enterprise, a business that must operate 24/7 365. To address this, Veeam has pioneered a new market of availability for the Always-On Enterprise by helping organisations meet recovery time and point objectives (RTPO) of less than 15 minutes for all applications and data.</p>
      <p>Veeam Availability Suite, which includes Veeam Backup &amp; Replication, leverages virtualisation, storage and cloud technologies that enable the modern data centre to help organisations save time, mitigate risks and dramatically reduce capital and operational costs, while always supporting the current and future business goals of Veeam customers.</p>
