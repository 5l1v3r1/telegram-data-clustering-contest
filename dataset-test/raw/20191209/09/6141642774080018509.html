      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said she has had lots of “unsolicited advice” during the election campaign – including a tip to wear lower cut tops.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said she has had people telling her to speak and dress differently, but said she will be “true to myself”.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader said the comments were not from within her own team.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Swinson said: “I get lots and lots of unsolicited advice. I’m not short of people telling me that I should speak differently or wear different shoes or wear different earrings.</p>
      <blockquote>I am who I am and some people will not like the way that I dress or talk or my accent or whatever<cite>Jo Swinson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“Or in one case, somebody suggested that I should wear lower cut tops.</p>
      <p>“I mean as if that’s going to be the thing that changes the poll rating. I’m not short of unsolicited advice.”</p>
      <p>Asked if the “advice” was coming from her own election team, she said: “Not in my election team, but as I say, I do get these gems of advice that come to me.</p>
      <p>“I am who I am and some people will not like the way that I dress or talk or my accent or whatever.</p>
      <p>“And fine. In a sense that’s their problem. I’m going to stand here, do the best that I can arguing for the positions that I believe in because I do believe our politics can be better.</p>
      <p>“And I’m going to be true to myself in the way I do it.”</p>
