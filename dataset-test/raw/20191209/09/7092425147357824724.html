      <p>Five people have died and several others are injured after a volcano erupted off the coast of New Zealand's North Island, spewing a plume of ash thousands of metres into the air.</p>
      <p>White Island is about 50km off the east coast of New Zealand's North Island and huge plumes were visible from the mainland.</p>
      <p>Volcanologists said the ash plume shot over 3,600 metres into the air. The eruption occurred about 2:11pm local time.</p>

      <p>Following the eruption, 23 people were evacuated from the island and seven of these people are critically injured. Up to 27 people are still unaccounted for and the island is currently too dangerous for police and rescue to access.</p>
      <p>Police have stated: "While it was initially believed there were approximately 100 people on or near the island at the time of the eruption, we now believe there were fewer than 50. There remain a number of people on the island who are unaccounted for."</p>
      <p>The New Zealand Police are continuing to work with the National Emergency Management Agency to coordinate a search and rescue operation following the volcanic eruption.</p>

      <p>A report from the police states: "Both New Zealanders and overseas tourists are believed to be involved. At this stage, we can confirm there has been one fatality, and based on the information we have it is likely there are others. A number of injured people have been transported to Whatkane Hospital and Middlemore Hospital.</p>
      <p>"Police are leading the search and rescue operation and we are working at pace to confirm the numbers of those involved.</p>
      <p>"The island is currently covered in ash and we are taking expert advice with regards to the conditions to determine when we can safely access the island. We will provide more details as soon as we are in a position to do so. People in the area should continue to go to the Civil Defence and Emergency Management website for any safety advice."</p>
