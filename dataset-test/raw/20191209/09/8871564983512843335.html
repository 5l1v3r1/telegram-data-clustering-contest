      <h1>Countdown to 2020 with Silent Disco at Empress Lawn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:50:04+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the endless list of NYE countdown parties, but Silent Disco Asia at the Marina Bay Countdown 2020 might be the perfect one for the discerning party people. Expect a madly fun night of genre-bending music, dancing, singing (badly) and general merriment with 3 DJs playing simultaneously across 3 channels, broadcasting directly to your personal set of LED equipped headphones. You can change DJs (and music genres) at the flick of a switch and take charge of your own playlist so you’ll never find yourself swaying awkwardly to a song you’re not totally feeling… we’ve all been there right?</p>
      <p>Silent Disco Asia has been specially invited to be part of the nation’s official countdown celebrations, bringing their trademark Silent Disco Asia party to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/3164271023600122/"><i>Unwind @ Civic District: Eats &amp; Beats</i></a> at the Empress Lawn. The event space boasts a great view of the spectacular fireworks display that rings in the New Year in Singapore, and it’ll also be host to a variety of food vendors as well as a fully stocked bar so all of your F&amp;B needs will be catered for. Ring in the new year against a backdrop of the stunning Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall. This is an open-air party not to be missed!</p>
