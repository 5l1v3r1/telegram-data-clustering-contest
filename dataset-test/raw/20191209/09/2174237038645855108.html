      <p>Former <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/twisted-sister-top-10-songs">Twisted Sister</a> frontman <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/dee-snider-twisted-sister-interview-2016-metal-meltdown-lemmy">Dee Snider</a> says the rumoured <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-greatest-acdc-songs-ever">AC/DC</a> reunion is on, with the band planning on releasing a new album in 2020.</p>
      <p>He posted a series of tweets addressing the current situation in the AC/DC camp and confirmed that “all four surviving members” were involved and it will include tracks recorded by the late <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/malcolm-young-january-6-1953-november-18-2017">Malcolm Young</a>.</p>
      <p>Snider began by saying that frontman Brian Johnson was “good” after his <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ac-dc-brian-johnson-stop-touring-hearing-loss">much publicised hearing problems</a>, and added: “All four surviving members have reunited with tracks recorded by Malcolm while he was still alive. </p>
      <p>“Malcolm's nephew Stevie Young is replacing him – he's done this a couple of times before. It's as close as you can get to the original band.”</p>
      <p>One of his Twitter followers then asked: “So, I gather that Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd will be back?” Snider replied: “Yup and yup!”</p>
      <p>Snider also turned his attention to the Super Bowl, saying: “I’m focused on one band for the 2021 halftime show: AC/DC! Reuniting with new album next year, touring, celebrating 50 years together.”</p>
      <p>News of an AC/DC reunion began to emerge in August last year, when <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/acdcs-brian-johnson-and-phil-rudd-pictured-together-in-vancouver">Johnson and estranged drummer Phil Rudd were spotted outside Vancouver’s Warehouse Studios</a> where the band have recorded several albums in the past.</p>
      <p>They were then photographed with longterm engineer Mike Fraser at the same location, with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/acdc-have-been-in-the-studio-doing-something-says-engineer-mike-fraser">Fraser later confirming the band have been back in the studio “doing something."</a></p>
      <p>Then, in April this year, US radio host <a href="https://eddietrunk.com/">Eddie Trunk</a> reported: “I have sources that have told me that they are absolutely going to tour with Brian back again. That’s all unconfirmed from their camp, but I had it from some reliable sources.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s pretty much a done deal that AC/DC, at the very least, are going to release some sort of record and it’ll be some sort of tribute to Malcolm Young, just like <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/ac-dc-the-epic-inside-story-of-back-in-black-by-brian-johnson"><i>Back In Black</i></a> was a tribute to <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-last-highway-the-untold-story-of-bon-scotts-death">Bon Scott</a>.</p>
      <p>“So I have no doubt about that, and I’m pretty confident they’re probably going to do shows as well, but I think at this point it’s pretty much just when they announce it.”</p>
      <p>Since his departure from AC/DC Johnson has played live <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ac-dc-ex-brian-johnson-guests-with-muse-at-reading-festival">with Muse</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ac-dcs-brian-johnson-returns-to-the-stage">Paul Rodgers</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/brian-johnson-joins-mick-fleetwood-for-cover-of-route-66">Mick Fleetwood</a>.</p>
