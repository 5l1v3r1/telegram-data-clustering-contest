      <p>It was so unfortunate that the rapper mentioned in one of his lyrics that he might not make it beyond the age of 21</p>
      <p>Reacting to his death, Tonto Dikeh shared:</p>
      <blockquote>“He said he would die at 21..<br/>Yesterday he died at 21..<br/><br/>I can’t OVER emphasis how important it is to speak of your self positively wether it be thru songs, poems, write up or straight Talk..<br/><br/>If you don’t learn this for your own good, Atleast do so for the ones who love and cherish you!!<br/>GREATEST WEAPON GOD GAVE MAN, “YOUR MOUTH”.</blockquote>
