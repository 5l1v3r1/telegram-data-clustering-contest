      <p>Netflix seems unusually chill about the emergence of Disney+ in Australia. How else do you explain its almost non-existent lineup this week? Over the next seven days, a grand total of six titles are coming to the service. There are no Netflix Original movies or TV shows either. Literally none.</p>
      <p>It's not unusual for Netflix to have one or two quieter weeks during the month but we don't recall ever seeing a lineup this paltry or anaemic before. On the plus side, this means you have a chance to catch up on all the content you haven't got around to watching yet.</p>
      <p>Here are the official synopses and trailers for each film and TV show. (You could probably get through these in an afternoon.)</p>
