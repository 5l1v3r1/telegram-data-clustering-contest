        <b>Anthony Joshua has said being heavyweight champion gave him “f****** headaches” prior to his initial defeat to Andy Ruiz Jr.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Anthony Joshua believes he will always have to prove himself in the heavyweight division, stating it is tough to live life as a champion.</p>
      <p>Joshua regained the IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles on Saturday, as he recorded a comprehensive points victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in a rematch in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Ruiz stunned Joshua in his initial victory in New York in June, as the Briton fell to the only defeat of his professional career, and the 30-year-old acknowledged he had been drained by the pressure of retaining his title.</p>
      <p>“The belts can be your best friend or your worst enemy,” Joshua, who is now expected to face one of his mandatory challengers Kubrat Pulev or Oleksandr Usyk, told reporters.</p>
      <p>“It just depends on you as a person. Even at the weigh-in when I gave him the belts [before the first fight], I was just tired of them. It’s hard being champion. Trust me, it’s not all fun.</p>
      <p>“I just remember hearing Mike Tyson telling people ‘you couldn’t walk in my shoes.’ It’s not all what it seems, it’s a life of discipline, dedication and f*****g headaches.</p>

      <p>“I’m always going to have to prove myself, aren’t I? That’s the name of the game. Over the next three to six months, I’m going to have to do it again.</p>
      <p>“It’s no good winning this time and losing next time, saying, ‘Look, I won six months ago, let’s look at that.’ Even though I’ve proved it to myself, I’m going to have to prove it to you guys once again. I can’t get too comfortable.</p>
      <p>“But I knew the belts were coming home. They spent some time with me and they spent some time in Andy’s house, and they were crying to come back to daddy.”</p>
      <p>Joshua has reportedly earned over £50million from taking the rematch with Ruiz to Saudi Arabia, though he is hoping to return to Britain for his next fight.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know, man. London’s calling,” Joshua said. “We’ve been away for the whole year, in New York and now here. But it’s nice to have a breather. It’s nice to have a bit of controversy, a bit of doubt.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been out here for two weeks. I was out for five weeks before [in New York], got too comfortable. Now it’s back home to Finchley, back home to Sheffield, back to the grind. Being back on home soil will make a big difference.”</p>
