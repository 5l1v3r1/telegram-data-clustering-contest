      <p>The team behind The Elder Scrolls Legends has ceased development on the game.</p>
      <p>In an announcement to the game's community via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollslegends/comments/e70lbu/an_update_on_the_elder_scrolls_legends/">Reddit</a>, the publisher announced that all new content developer or releases have been put "on hold for the foreseeable future."</p>
      <p>The game's roadmap had previously suggested one more expansion pack would be released before the end of the year, but these plans have been scrapped.</p>
      <p>However, Bethesda has assured that it will continue to support the game with regular in-game events and reward cards every month, as well as ongoing maintenance support.</p>
      <p>It has also clarified that the development and release for the Asia-specific version, which operates separately, will not be affected and will "inform our decisions on content and feature development going forward."</p>
      <p>It was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollslegends/comments/e70lbu/an_update_on_the_elder_scrolls_legends/fa0vw40/?context=3">further stressed</a> that both versions of Legends would continue to operate after the launch of the Asian edition and will not be merged, keeping their player bases separate.</p>
