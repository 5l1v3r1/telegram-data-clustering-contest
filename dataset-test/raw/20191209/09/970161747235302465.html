      <p>The I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here camp mates appear to have achieved the unthinkable and created for themselves a Brexit-free utopia after banning the word in camp.</p>
      <p>… Anyone else suddenly fancying a couple of weeks away in the Australian Outback?</p>
      <p>As the UK continues to be knee-deep in election confusion, fierce debate and three years into <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> talks, the campers decided that while they were in the series, they were allowed a politics free world.</p>
      <p>Yeah, at this point we’re extremely jealous of that, if we’re honest here.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway, who came fourth on the show, and Andy Whyment, who placed runner up, appeared on GMB and made the revelation.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the pair, Piers Morgan said: ‘You’ll be pleased to know, nothing’s changed in Brexit. The world’s still gone nuts.</p>
      <p>‘You haven’t really missed much, but great to have you back.’</p>

      <p>‘That word was banned in camp. That word was banned,’ Corrie star Andy responded.</p>
      <p>‘I have no idea what’s happened, but you can fill me in,’ Kate then told her co-star.</p>
      <p>With the election coming up this week and Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn going head-to-head in debates (or avoiding them altogether), the idea of this political detox sounds pretty fab at this point.</p>
      <p>We’d even be willing to consider taking on a Bushtucker trial or two for the peace and quiet!</p>

      <p>While talking to Kate and Andy, Piers took a moment to congratulate his friend and co-star for her ‘brilliant’ job in the jungle.</p>
      <p>‘You guys did brilliantly. You were obviously hugely popular as you were in the last four both of you,’ he told her.</p>
      <p>‘You’re our queen Kate. We’re very proud of you,’ Piers continued.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve shown everyone what you’re really like, which is what you’re like on telly.</p>
      <p>‘What you see is what you get. We’re very proud of you, congratulations.’</p>
