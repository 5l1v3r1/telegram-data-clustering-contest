      <h1>Dart text alert system receives 145 messages in three months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:23:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Fireworks being set off on trains, passengers drinking and taking drugs, and people urinating on platforms are some of the issues raised with Dart security staff.</p>
      <p>145 texts were sent over a three month period after the monitored alert system was introduced in August.</p>
      <p>The system, which alerts security staff, was set up after an increase in anti-social behaviour on trains.</p>
      <p>More than a third of passengers complained about anti-social behaviour involving groups of teenagers.</p>
      <p>Barry Kenny from Irish Rail said it remains one of the biggest concerns for Dart users.</p>
      <p>"This is reflected in the text alrets," said Mr Kenny.</p>
      <p>"It isn't a situation where there is a violent situation but none the less in a confined space, we recognise how intimidating that can be.</p>
      <p>"We are ensuring that our security personnel are addressing these issues as they are reported."</p>
