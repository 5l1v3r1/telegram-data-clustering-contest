      <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will travel to Washington to meet for talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on December 10, the U.S. State Department has said in a brief statement.</p>
      <p>The two countries' top diplomats will "discuss a broad range of regional and bilateral issues," according to the statement.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post and AP on December 6 quoted senior U.S. officials as saying that a joint news conference was likely to follow.</p>
      <p>They said the two diplomats would discuss Ukraine, Syria, arms control, and other issues related to currently tense U.S.-Russia relations.</p>
      <p>A crucial summit in Paris precedes Lavrov's visit, where the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia will have met to find a lasting a truce in the simmering military conflict in two eastern regions of Ukraine, where more than 13,000 people have been killed since April 2014.</p>
      <p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova earlier said Lavrov's "meeting is being prepared" for December 10, but she did not provide details.</p>
      <p>Pompeo and Lavrov have met several times over the past year and have spoken occasionally by phone.</p>
      <p>Lavrov and Russia's then-ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, met at the White House with President Donald Trump in May 2017, prior to Pompeo becoming secretary of state.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if Lavrov will meet with Trump during this visit.</p>
