      <h1>Leicester keeps pressure on Liverpool</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:32:46+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>The Fox hunt hasn’t been disbanded just yet.</p>
      <p>Leicester City have handed Aston Villa their biggest defeat of the season as they sounded a warning to league leaders Liverpool – the title race isn’t over.</p>
      <p>Leicester registered its eighth successive Premier League victory – a club record – with Jamie Vardy netting twice in its 4-1 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The problem for Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers is that Liverpool are eight points in front.</p>
      <p>There is still more than half the season remaining and a meeting between the top two on December 26.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think anyone expects us to be near the top,” former Reds boss Rodgers said.</p>
      <p>“After Manchester United won at Manchester City on Saturday, the caption came up about how far City are away from Liverpool (14 points).</p>
      <p>“We respect that, we get on with our work and keep developing as a team.”</p>
      <p>Rodgers knows all about title challenges, winning the Scottish top flight twice with Celtic after falling just short of City in the 2014 title race while managing Liverpool.</p>
      <p>He watched from afar as Claudio Ranieri defied 5000-1 odds to win the Premier League for Leicester in 2016.</p>
      <p>“We have finished ninth in the last two seasons but today we looked like a top team,” Rodgers said.</p>
      <p>“It was a real historic day, to surpass the club record of straight wins in the top flight was fantastic for us.”</p>
      <p>Vardy opened the scoring in the 20th minute and Kelechi Iheanacho doubled the lead four minutes before halftime.</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish pulled a goal back in first-half stoppage time but Jonny Evans’ header after the break restored Leicester’s two-goal advantage before Vardy wrapped the game up with 15 minutes left with his 16th of the campaign.</p>
      <p>“Jamie is such a top-level player, he is always ready when the chances come,” Rodgers said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s any doubt he isn’t going to score.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Socceroos goalkeeper Mat Ryan has now made the second-most saves this season with 62 after his performance in Brighton &amp; Hove Albion’s 2-2 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>The results saw Wolves match a 57-year-old club record by going an 11th top-flight game unbeaten.</p>
      <p>Diogo Jota got the opener for Wolves and the leveller on 44 minutes.</p>
      <p>Neal Maupay and Davy Propper struck in quick succession to give Brighton a 2-1 lead.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Southampton and Norwich City are in the bottom three after both lost 2-1 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United came from behind to overcome Norwich courtesy of a George Baldock winner to move into eighth place while Newcastle jumped to 10th thanks to Federico Fernandez’s 87th-minute strike at home to the Saints.</p>
