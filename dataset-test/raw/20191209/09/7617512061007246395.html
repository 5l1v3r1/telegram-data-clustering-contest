      <h1>Greater Victoria hockey tournament hit with norovirus-like outbreak</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:38:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author">Cindy E. Harnett</a></address>
      <p>Island Health says there are no new reported cases of a norovirus-like outbreak that affected players in a hockey tournament over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“We have not had any reports that the suspected noro-like virus has spread beyond people taking part in the tournament,” said Island Health in an email on Monday.</p>
      <p>A medical health officer is reaching out to tournament organizers to determine how people fell ill and track their progress and any possible spread.</p>
      <p>The four-day 47th Annual Rick Lapointe Memorial bantam-level hockey tournament, which began Thursday at four rinks in Greater Victoria, was interrupted after some players exhibited symptoms of a norovirus infection — diarrhea, vomiting, nausea or stomach pain.</p>
      <p>Island Health said it was informed of the outbreak and worked “closely” with tournament organizers to manage the situation.</p>
      <p>“Tournament organizers were very proactive in dealing with this situation and implementing additional hygiene measures to decrease the risk of spreading the illness,” said Island Health.</p>
      <p>Tournament organizers monitored the health of all players and ill players dropped out of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Norovirus is highly contagious and is spread through direct contact with an infected person, consuming contaminated water or food, or touching contaminated surfaces.</p>
      <p>Such outbreaks occur most often from November to April.</p>
      <p>Sick players stopped playing in the tournament on the weekend and others were monitored. Additional hygiene measures were recommended to decrease the risk of spreading the illness.</p>
      <p>Players who returned to the Lower Mainland stayed in their vehicles on B.C. Ferries “to help limit transmission of the virus,” said Island Health.</p>
      <p>Players came from across the West Coast to play at four venues in Greater Victoria: Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre, Pearkes Arena, Juan de Fuca Arena and Ian Stewart Complex. The tournament ended on Sunday at the Ian Stewart Complex.</p>
      <p>To prevent illness, health officials recommend regular handwashing, rinsing fruits and vegetables thoroughly, cooking shellfish thoroughly, and staying home when ill. It’s also advisable not to prepare food for others for two days after symptoms stop.</p>
