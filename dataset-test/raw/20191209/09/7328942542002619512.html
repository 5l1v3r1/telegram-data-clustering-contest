      <h1>Is the FDA's Speedy Approval of New Drugs Putting Us at Risk?</h1>
      <h2>The FDA's priority review process is putting new drugs on the market in just six months rather than the usual ten months.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:31:40+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author">Marcia Wendorf</a></address>
      <p>A <b>December 6, 2019</b> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-06/fda-is-green-lighting-drugs-at-breakneck-speed-and-raising-alarm">story by Bloomberg</a> reported that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is approving new drugs at an unprecedented rate.</p>
      <p>In <b>October 2019</b>, Trikafta, a drug from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. used to treat cystic fibrosis, was approved <b>five months</b> early. Vertex's investors called it an early Christmas gift from the FDA.</p>

      </p>
      <p>On <b>November 25, 2019</b>, the FDA approved Global Blood Therapeutics Inc.'s new sickle cell drug, Oxbryta, almost <b>three months</b> ahead of its scheduled approval date, which is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_Drug_User_Fee_Act">Prescription Drug User Fee Act</a> (PDUFA) date. PDUFA was passed in <b>1992</b>, and it allows the FDA to collect fees from drug manufacturers to fund the new drug approval process.</p>
      <p>Another sickle cell drug, Adakveo, from Novartis AG, was approved in <b>November 2019</b>, <b>62</b> days ahead of its scheduled approval date. A drug to treat <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/lymphoma/lymphoma-non-hodgkin/understanding-cancer/types-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/mantle-cell-lymphoma.html">mantle cell lymphoma</a>, BeiGene Ltd.'s Brukinsa, was approved <b>three months</b> ahead of its PDUFA date.</p>
      <h3>What's driving this change?</h3>
      <p>Normally, it takes the FDA <b>ten months</b> to approve a new drug, however, for drugs that treat conditions that have few therapies, or for drugs that show exceptional promise, the FDA offers a priority review that takes only <b>six months</b>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That priority review was given to <b>three-fourths</b> of the record number of drugs that were approved in <b>2018</b>, <b>59</b>. During one <b>thirty day period</b> in <b>2019</b>, from <b>mid-October to mid-November</b>, the FDA approved <b>five</b> medicines, the quickest taking only <b>eight weeks</b>.</p>
      <p>Pharmaceutical manufacturers explain this landslide of new drugs by touting breakthroughs in biotechnology and genetics and say that their scientists are providing the FDA with better data.</p>

      <p>The Bloomberg article quoted the director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Janet Woodcock, as saying, "If there are people out there with no options and they have terrible diseases, we are going to get those drugs to them as fast as feasible."</p>
      <p>While that's great for sufferers, it's also great for the pharmaceutical manufacturers, and those who invest in them, but is the expedited process putting the public's health at risk?</p>
      <h3>A risk to our health?</h3>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3837">recent study</a>, drugs that went through the expedited approval process rather than the regular process were <b>48%</b> more likely to get either a black-box warning or to receive contraindications that restrict the drug's use.</p>

      <p>Black box warnings are the FDA's strictest labeling requirement. First implemented in <b>1979</b>, black-box warnings highlight serious and sometimes life-threatening adverse drug reactions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://news.yale.edu/2017/04/05/fda-approves-drugs-more-quickly-peer-agency-europe">A <b>2017</b> study</a> reported that <b>71</b> of the <b>222</b> drugs approved by the FDA between <b>2000</b> and <b>2010</b> were withdrawn, required a black-box warning, or received a safety warning.</p>
      <p>More worrying still, the study found that the FDA approved new drugs faster than it's European counterpart, the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en">European Medicines Agency</a> (EMA).</p>
      <p>Drugs that have been pulled from the market due to safety concerns include:</p>

      <p>A <b>2017</b> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/09/527575055/one-third-of-new-drugs-had-safety-problems-after-fda-approval">NPR article</a> quoted Dr. Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness as saying, "All too often, patients and clinicians mistakenly view FDA approval as [an] indication that a product is fully safe and effective. Nothing could be further from the truth. We learn tremendous amounts about a product only once it's on the market and only after use among a broad population."</p>
      <p>The public's only response to that is "caveat emptor", or let the buyer beware.</p>
