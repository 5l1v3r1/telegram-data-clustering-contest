      <p>The leader of the banned Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has debunked rumours that Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe is sponsoring his group, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that the pro-Biafra leader said this on Sunday during a live broadcast on Radio Biafra.</p>
      <p>Senator Abaribe and two others stood as sureties for Kanu to be granted bail on health grounds by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on April 25, 2017.</p>
      <p>Justice Binta Nyako, who presided over the case, granted the pro-Biafra leader bail on health grounds, after part of the charges filed against him and three others – were struck out by the court.</p>
      <p>While ruling on the bail application, Justice Nyako banned Kanu from speaking with the press and taking part in any rally or joining a crowd of over 10 persons.</p>
      <p>During the live broadcast, Kanu had also condemned the treatment meted out to the Convener of the Revolution Now movement Omoyele Sowore by the Department of State Services (DSS).</p>
      <p>Also, he said Abaribe had never given a dime to the pro-Biafra group but that he loves him (Abaribe) as he speaks the truth always.</p>
      <p>He denied reports that IPOB gets backing from some leaders in the South-East region, also.</p>
      <p>“Have you seen anybody tough Abaribe?” he asked. “Tough him and you will see. Abaribe has not given IPOB one dime but the man speaks the truth, that is why I love Abaribe.”</p>
