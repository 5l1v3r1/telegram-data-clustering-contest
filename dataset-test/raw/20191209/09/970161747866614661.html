      <h1>Rare whisky collection expected to sell for £8,000,000 at auction</h1>

      <p>Whisky lovers: get your pennies together, because a rare collection is set to go under the hammer.</p>
      <p>The haul is made up of more than 3,900 bottles, and is sure to impress if you have friends round (though you may not want to ever open them).</p>
      <p>It includes the most expensive single bottle in the world, a 1926 Fine and Rare Macallan, which sold for £1.5 million.</p>
      <p>Richard Gooding, a former PepsiCo bottling magnate, built the collection over decades, regularly travelling to Scotland from his US home to source special bottles at auctions and distilleries before his death in 2014.</p>
      <p>He kept the thousands of bottles in his own ‘pub’ – a room in his family home in Colorado specially designed to display the collection.</p>
      <p>After being contacted by his family, Perthshire business Whisky Auctioneer will sell the collection over two online auctions next year.</p>

      <p>Mr Gooding’s widow Nancy said: ‘It was clear to us as a family that collecting Scotch was one of Richard’s greatest passions – an endeavour that spanned over two decades.</p>
      <p>‘He loved every aspect of it, from researching the many single malt distilleries to visiting them and tasting their whiskies.</p>
      <p>‘He was always so pleased to acquire the bottles that he was searching for over the years – his mission was to collect a bottle that represented every single distillery but his favourite was always Bowmore, with his preferred whisky being Black Bowmore.</p>
      <p>‘Richard truly loved and was proud of his collection and enjoyed sharing it with friends and fellow Scotch lovers in his ‘pub’ at home.’</p>
      <p>Iain McClune, Whisky Auctioneer founder, said the collection coming to auction is ‘unprecedented’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘There’s never been a private sale of a collection like this ever before at auction – more than 3,900 bottles from one private collector.</p>

      <p>‘It’s the largest collection by value, by volume as well, and it’s very exciting to be part of that, to bring this to Whisky Auctioneer and to the wider public.</p>
      <p>‘What’s exciting about this collection is Mr Gooding really developed and built an extensive range of whiskies across the whole Scotch Whisky industry and from other countries as well.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘It really comprises everything from independent bottlings from closed distilleries, from the big brand names like Macallan and Bowmore and so on. It’s a wonderful opportunity.<br/>“There’s 1926 Fine and Rare Macallan which recently became the most expensive bottle of whisky sold in the world.</p>
      <p>‘There’s also the 1926 Valerio Adami. These are two of the most legendary, most expensive whiskies ever produced.</p>
      <p>‘Over several decades, Mr Gooding spent his time really putting together what was considered the perfect collection of whisky in his eyes and it really does show.’</p>
      <p>The collection will go on sale over two auctions, from February 7-17 and April 10-20 2020, via the Whisky Auctioneer website.</p>
