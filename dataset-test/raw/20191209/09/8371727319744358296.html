      <h1>Airtel Announces Out of Bundle Rates, Revamps Amazing Data Bundles</h1>
      <h2>This is a smart way of having a no expiry option without having non expiry bundles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:01:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:01</time> by <a rel="author">Kiruti Itimu</a></address>
      <p>Airtel Kenya has today launched out of bundle rates, which comes after <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/10/23/safaricom-no-expiry-date-data-and-calling-bundles/">Safaricom launched a similar product some time ago.</a> These have a new tagline which is #BeSurewithAirtel</p>
      <p>In the previous system, Airtel charged Kshs 4.3 per MB for out of bundle rates which meant that using 5MB of data cost you Kshs 21.50 or if you used 50MB, that would cost Kshs 215!</p>
      <p>In the new system, that same 5MB of data will only cost you 1 KES while 50MB of data will only cost you 10 KES.  They will also charge Kshs 2 per minute for calls. All you have to do is dial *544*2# according to Airtel.</p>
      <p>This is a great move for the over 12 million Airtel customers who will get out of bundle data at cheaper rates.</p>
      <p>This is a very smart move by Airtel to have ‘no expiry bundles’ without necessarily having no expiry bundles. By substantially lowering the price of out of bundle rates, Airtel customers can estimate how much their airtime would last them when they are online.</p>
      <h3>Revamped Amazing data bundles</h3>
      <p>Airtel is also revamping their Amazing Data Bundles. The company is now giving more data bundles for the same price. The Amazing Data bundles have an expiry period just like before, but now Airtel has decided to double the data offerings in some cases</p>
      <p>Here are the new prices which you can compare with <a href="https://techweez.com/2018/10/25/airtel-new-amazing-data-bundles/">the old rates</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazing 20 – 200MB (1 day)</li>
        <li>Amazing 50 – 500 MB (1 day)</li>
        <li>Amazing 50 – 350 MB (7 days)</li>
        <li>Amazing 100 – 750MB (7 days)</li>
        <li>Amazing 300 – 3GB (30 days)</li>
        <li>Amazing 500 –  5GB (30 days)</li>
        <li>Amazing 1000 – 12GB (30 days)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
