      <h1>A new Crash Bandicoot game may be revealed this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:34:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:34</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Activision may once again be teasing a new Crash Bandicoot game reveal.</p>
      <p>A number of influencers have received Christmas-themed <b>Crash Bandicoot</b> figures recently, suspiciously close this week’s big reveal events.</p>
      <p>YouTuber <a href="https://twitter.com/Canadianguyehh">Canadian Guy Eh</a> spotted social media posts from a number of “large scale” influencers, all of whom posing with a figurine from the Crash series they had just received.</p>
      <p>You may remember that Activision utilised this particular tactic almost exactly a year ago, sending Christmas cookies and other themed gifts to influencers and members of the press just days before <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/12/07/crash-team-racing-remastered-release-date-trailer/">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled was announced</a> at The game Awards 2018.</p>

      <p>This also isn’t the first time the publisher teased a new Crash Bandicoot game. Sony’s recent It’s Time to Play ad campaign featured a new <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/20/new-crash-bandicoot-game-may-be-in-development/">character model for Crash</a>, as well as a new mask. This was followed by a 4Chan rumour which said that Crash Bandicoot Worlds is the name of the game from which the new material originates.</p>
      <p>Considering how recent all of this is, and the two big events taking place this week, there’s a very good chance we’re getting an announcement before the end of the week. The year’s final <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/12/06/last-state-of-play-2019-december-date/">State of Play</a> airs tomorrow, followed by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/12/05/the-game-awards-2019-will-feature-around-10-new-game-announcements/">The Game Awards ceremony</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It’s worth keeping in mind that this may not necessarily be a new full game, as it could simply be new content for Nitro-Fueled or N’Sane Trilogy, though that is unlikely.</p>
