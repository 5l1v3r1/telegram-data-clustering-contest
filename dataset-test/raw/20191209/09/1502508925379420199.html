      <p>India climbed one spot to 129 among 189 countries in the 2019 human development index, according to a report by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/united-nations">United Nations </a>Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
      <p>In India, 27.1 crore people were lifted out of poverty from 2005-06 to 2015-16, UNDP India resident representative Shoko Noda said.</p>
      <p>India ranked 130 last year. The steady progress was due to nearly three decades of rapid development, which had seen a dramatic reduction in absolute poverty, along with gains in life expectancy, education, and access to health care, she said.</p>
      <p>As per the HDI, no other region had experienced such rapid human development progress.</p>
      <p>South Asia was the fastest growing region witnessing 46 per cent growth during 1990-2018, followed by East Asia and the Pacific at 43 per cent.</p>
