      <p>That one thing that many were cribbing about for years about his own fans, Pawan Kalyan realized it now finally. But that is too late already as they are out of hands now. As you might have guessed, it is about how crazy and annoying Pawan Kalyan fans get sometimes like shouting and creating nuisance at various events.</p>
      <p>The video of Pawan Kalyan who failed to prove his ability in politics that last elections blaming the failure on the fans and their low discipline levels has gone viral online. “You have no discipline and I lost because of you” is what the leader told to his fans who were yelling at his own political event. Now he realized and reacted which he should have done long back when all the Tollywood top heroes even his mega brother Chiranjeevi was annoyed because of them.</p>
      <p>If you remember, Allu Arjun sensed this attitude of the fans who were disturbing the cinema events of other heroes and also gave requesting warning to the fans to behave at events as their irresistibly naughty attitude is only bringing disgrace to their star. But PK did not react then and now he does after they go out of his control too. Thank goodness, at least, he did now.</p>
