      <p>Jac and Dan, 28, put on a united front as they shared a kiss, after The Sun revealed the former Towie star cheated on his wife last year in a wild threesome with Chloe Ayling, 22, and Natalie Nunn, 34.</p>
      <p>He led his wife into the hotel, where their daughters, Ella, four, and Mia, one, waited for their mum in matching dresses.</p>
      <p>The family were all smiles as she picked them both up for a hug.</p>
      <p>Her mum and dad - Sarah and John Jossa - were waiting for the actress in the hotel, alongside her I'm A Celeb campmates.</p>

      <p>Despite the loving display, a show insider told how the troubled couple headed straight for crisis talks to discuss the cheating allegations.</p>
      <p>"It feels like Jacqueline has grown and is stronger than when she went in there," a source told<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/tv-film-news/jacqueline-jossa-leaves-im-celeb-21054176"> The Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>"She loves Dan but they have split up several times before so it would not be a huge surprise if they split up again in the future, despite Dan denying all the allegations and insisting he is not worried about the situation. Time will tell."</p>
      <p>This will be the first time the family are reunited since fellow campmate Myles Stephenson told Jac Dan had cheated on her with Love Island's Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>The revelation caused Jacqueline, who married Dan in 2017, to remove her wedding ring and threaten to quit.</p>

      <p>Just days before Jac left the jungle, Chloe Ayling told The Sun how her, Dan and Natalie had a steamy group sex session after the end of last year's Celebrity Big Brother following a boozy night out in London.</p>
      <p>Chloe said: “Dan cheated on Jacqueline with me and Natalie. We’d all had a lot to drink and a threesome happened.</p>
      <p>“He had full sex with Natalie in in front of me in the bathroom, and then kissed and performed a sex act on me.</p>
      <p>“It was a debauched night – we were drunk and we let loose."</p>
      <p>ITV bosses dramatically axed an early reunion on I'm A Celeb between Dan and Jac amid fears she would break down in tears.</p>
      <p>A source told The Sun: "The visit would have been really awkward for her.</p>

      <p>"Bosses couldn’t give her advance notice as it would ruin the surprise, which is the whole point of the reunion segment.</p>
      <p>"But if they didn’t give her a heads-up and she hated that Dan had been sent in it could’ve really upset her.</p>
      <p>"ITV are all about duty of care. They decided that Dan and Jacqueline’s first proper conversation since the dramas emerged should be off- camera and not in front of millions of viewers."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jac's parents stayed far away from Dan on the I'm A Celebrity bus to the finale last night.</p>

      <p>Selina captioned the picture: "On our way to get you @jacjossa [you're] our winner no matter what. Good luck everyone."</p>
      <p>But eagle-eyed fans spotted they had chosen to sit four rows away from their son-in-law.</p>
