        <b>Steve Harvey relived his 2015 horrors by making an awkward mix-up while hosting this year’s Miss Universe pageant.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The television host accidentally named the wrong winner for the best national costume category and everyone simultaneously winced.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old announced Miss Philippines as the winner when the actual winner, Miss Malaysia, stood beside him.</p>
      <p>Everyone in the audience probably thought: ‘Oh God, not again.’</p>
      <p>The real winner, Shweta Sekhon, quickly grabbed the microphone from Steve and corrected him.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘It’s not Philippines, its Malaysia.’</p>
      <p>Big yikes.</p>

      <p>Steve must be cursed when it comes to Miss Universe as the star made a similar mistake of naming Miss Colombia the winner of the 2015 pageant when Miss Philippines had won.</p>
      <p>Maybe four years from now he’ll name Malaysia as the winner when it’s Argentina.</p>
      <p>At the time, the crowd and everyone around the world watched with second-hand embarrassment as the crown had to be moved from the head of Miss Colombia onto the actual winner’s head.</p>
      <p>What made it worse was Miss Colombia – real name Ariadna Gutierrez – waving and blowing kisses at the crowd.</p>
      <p>However, this year’s Shweta made sure to prematurely fix the blunder before it went too far.</p>
      <p>After realising his mistake, Steve explained: ‘Let me explain something to you. I just read that in the teleprompter.</p>
      <p>‘Y’all got to quit doing this to me. I can read. Now, they are trying to fix it now. See? This is what they did to me back in 2015, played me short like that.’</p>

      <p>Steve is apparently still haunted by the events in 2015 and we don’t blame him.</p>
      <p>‘That’s crazy,’ he added.</p>
      <p>At this point, it feels like someone is out to get him.</p>
      <p>Miss Malaysia’s costume was inspired by the Peranakans, who descended from Chinese settlers, and was designed by couturier Carven Ong.</p>
      <p>It focused on Peranakan bridal traditions and included elaborate designs such as wings, a gorgeous gold headpiece, and bedazzled altars around the bottom of the dress which featured traditional Peranakan sweets and treats.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Miss South Africa Zozibini Tunzi was crowned the winner of Miss Universe 2019.</p>
