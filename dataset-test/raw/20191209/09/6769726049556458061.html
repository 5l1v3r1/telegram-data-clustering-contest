      <h1>Perth pub closes doors after nearly 50 years</h1>

      <p>PUNTERS can take home a piece of a Perth pub which has closed its doors after nearly 50 years.</p>
      <p>The Northlands Tavern, also known as the Roundhouse, has shut ahead of anticipated development of the site.</p>
      <p>A notice from the operators said the restaurant, bar, bottle shop and TAB had closed because of redevelopment and thanked its “wonderful loyal clients who have become friends over our 13 years in the business”.</p>
      <p>The tavern was built in 1973 at the Northlands shopping centre site at the corner of Amelia and Main streets.</p>

      <p>Items including tables and chairs, audio equipment, fridges, sports memorabilia, TVs, dishwashers and a complete kitchen are being auctioned on site on Thursday from 10am.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman on behalf of centre manager Primewest said the owners had financially supported the tavern operators for several years.</p>
      <p>“But with a downturn in trade and an ageing asset, the parties have mutually decided to close the business,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Retail shopping centres across the country are currently going through a transition and the owners of the Balcatta site will take this opportunity to redevelop the site and are reviewing alternative uses for the western car park.</p>

      <p>“While many locals may have enjoyed the Roundhouse since it’s opening in 1973, the current level of patronage is insufficient for any of these redevelopment plans to include a new or refurbished tavern.</p>
      <p>“The owners instead hope to be in a position to lodge a development application with the council in early 2020 and will in due course make announcements on the centre’s improvements.”</p>
