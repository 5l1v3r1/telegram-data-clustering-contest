      <h1>Jhunjhunwala likely to withdraw from YES Bank's preferential share offer</h1>
      <h2>Lender’s board may also reject the $1.2-b offer by Erwin Singh Braich, SPGP Holdings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:12:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">PALAK SHAH/SURABHI</a></address>
      <p>Fresh concerns seem to be emerging about private sector lender YES Bank’s capital-raising plans as billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is likely to withdraw plans to invest $25 million in the lender through his wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala’s family office. He is expected to issue a formal letter to this effect on Tuesday when the board of directors of YES Bank meets to discuss the capital-raising plans.</p>
      <p>“The logic behind not subscribing to YES Bank’s preferential allotment by Jhunjhunwala is that it is higher than the prevailing market price. There is also a lock-in period of one year.</p>
      <p>Instead, Jhunjhunwala can easily buy YES Bank shares in the open market, lower than the preferential issue price, and it will also not have any lock-in period,” said sources close to the development.</p>
      <p>The preferential offer that YES Bank had recently announced is priced at around ₹78. YES Bank shares closed at around ₹56 on Monday on the BSE.</p>
      <p>An email sent to Jhunjhunjwala’s Rare Enterprises by <i>BusinessLine</i> remained unanswered. Significantly, on November 4, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had purchased 1.29 crore shares, amounting to a 0.51 per cent stake in YES Bank. The transaction through a bulk deal was at a price of ₹67.10 apiece, taking the total value of the deal to about ₹87 crore.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, sources also indicated that YES Bank’s board is likely to reject the $1.2-billion offer by Canadian billionaire Erwin Singh Braich and SPGP Holdings.</p>
      <p>“This is purely speculative and YES Bank does not, as a matter of policy, comment on market speculation,” said a YES Bank spokesperson in response to an e-mail by <i>BusinessLine</i> on the two issues.</p>
      <p>The board of Yes Bank had, on November 29, approved plans to raise $2-billion capital through preferential allotment of shares.</p>
      <p>Apart from Braich and Jhunjhunwala, investors, including include Citax Holdings Ltd and Citax Investment Group, are keen to invest $500 million. The bank had also said that a top-tier US fund house is willing to invest $120 million.</p>
      <p>Other interested investors include GMR Group and Associates, which are keen to invest $50 million; Aditya Birla Family Office and Rekha Jhunjhunwala are also keen to pledge $25 million each.</p>
      <p>Foreign institutional investors Discovery Capital and Ward Ferry are willing to invest $50 million and $30 million.</p>
