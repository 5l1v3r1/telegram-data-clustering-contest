      <p>A two-year-old girl, Parker Curry visited the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC accompanied by her mother, her sister, and her best friend during the spring season of 2018. They came across a lot of artwork that day but a portrait of the First Lady Michelle Obama made by Amy Sherald made Parker stop and look up in wonder. Parker who is four years old now recalled that the portrait of First Lady Michelle Obama emerged before her and it was very appealing. She said that she was inspired by the painting and added that Michelle Obama is now her friend.</p>

      <h3>Moment becomes a viral sensation</h3>
      <p>The moment became a viral sensation when a fellow museum-goer captured an awesome picture of her standing astonished. Less than a week later, Parker got to meet and danced with Obama. The experience has inspired her to pen down a picture book 'Parker Looks Up' written by Parker and her mother, Jessica Curry Morton and illustrated by Brittany Jackson.<br/>Parker said that it is fun working with her mother. In the above-mentioned book, Parker highlighted a number of the Portrait Gallery's famous paintings. She said that it is difficult to translate the artwork into a book for kids. Jackson said that she wanted to respect Amy Sherald. She added that she drew it in her own style which is cartoonized to some extent.</p>

She added that Jackson's illustrations recall the magical moment of life. She said that when she looks at the picture she usually smiles and gets teary-eyed. She added that it was a beautiful moment that will inspire children and people for many generations.</p>
