      <p>TransLink is preparing customers after CUPE 7000, the union representing 900 SkyTrain workers, announced that it would forward with <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/12/07/skytrain-strike-tuesday-vancouver/">full withdrawal of services on Tuesday, Dec. 10</a>.</p>
      <p>The transit authority released a statement listing a number of options for riders if union job action causes a total Expo and Millennium Line shut down December 10, 11 and 12. It adds that they, “should be aware the travel options will not match the level of service these SkyTrain lines provide.”  </p>
      <p>With this in mind, TransLink notes that the following services will be operating normally, including: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Canada Line</li>
        <li>West Coast Express</li>
        <li>Coast Mountain Bus</li>
        <li>West Vancouver Blue Bus</li>
        <li>HandyDART</li>
        <li>SeaBus</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Earlier today, Coast Mountain Bus Company announced that it <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/12/09/skytrain-strike-vancouver/">would not be increasing bus service</a> in response to the planned strike given operational constraints and labour considerations. As such, customers should expect heavier passenger volume. </p>
      <p>If possible, customers are advised to make other arrangements such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using one of our park and rides to connect to bus service</li>
        <li>Travelling outside of rush hours</li>
        <li>Working from home</li>
        <li>Using a carpooling service such as <a href="http://liftango.com/">Liftango</a> and <a href="http://www.gobyride.com/">gobyRIDE</a></li>
        <li>Walking or cycling to work</li>
        <li>Free bike valet service at Vancouver Public Library from 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To plan a trip without SkyTrain, both TransLink’s Trip Planner and Google Maps have an option to exclude SkyTrain. Visit <a href="http://translink.ca/stayinformed">translink.ca/stayinformed</a> to learn more about alternative travel options.</p>
