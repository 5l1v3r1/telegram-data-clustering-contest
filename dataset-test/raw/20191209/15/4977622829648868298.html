      <p>A Delhi Court on Monday (9 December) allowed Robert Vadra, businessman and Congress interim Chief Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law, to travel to Spain for medical treatment and business purposes.</p>
      <p>The court allowed Vadra to travel abroad while hearing his plea seeking the court's permission after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed its response.</p>
      <p>Vadra, who is married to Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, had moved a plea on Saturday seeking permission to travel to Spain for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The court had sought the ED response over this.</p>
      <p>Vadra is facing the financial probe agency investigation under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) pertaining to allegations of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property at 12, Bryanston Square, worth 1.9 million pounds. The property is allegedly owned by Vadra. He is currently out on anticipatory bail.</p>
