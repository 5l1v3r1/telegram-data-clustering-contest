      <h1>Jim Jordan: House Democratic staff not 'accountable to the people'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:55:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Dominick Mastrangelo</a></address>
      <p>Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff should be testifying <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-judiciary-committee-holds-latest-impeachment-testimony">before the House Judiciary Committee</a> instead of lawyers for the two parties arguing over whether or not to impeach President Trump.</p>
      <p>"We don't get to hear from Adam Schiff today," Jordan complained. "Under Nadler’s rules, 4 hours of today’s impeachment hearing will be staff asking staff questions. Dems want to use unelected staff to remove a duly-elected President, none of whom are directly accountable to the people."</p>

      <p>After questioning foreign diplomats during public hearings, Daniel Goldman, the Judiciary Committee lawyer for the Democrats, and Stephen R. Castor, the Judiciary Committee lawyer for the Republicans, are laying out the evidence for or against impeachment.</p>
      <p>Jordan has been one of Trump's <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/adam-schiff-to-jim-jordan-i-do-not-know-the-identity-of-the-whistleblower">most vocal defenders</a> against Democrats' impeachment push. He and his Republican colleagues have spent recent weeks discrediting Schiff and other leading Democrats who they say lack a serious case for impeachment.</p>
      <p>The impeachment proceedings center on Trump's contacts with the government of Ukraine and his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">July 25 call </a>with the country's president. During the call, Trump asked the leader of Ukraine to investigate a political rival.</p>
      <p>Democrats say this was an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/democrats-likely-to-impeach-trump-on-obstruction-and-abuse-of-power">abuse of power</a> and warrants impeachment and removal from office.</p>
