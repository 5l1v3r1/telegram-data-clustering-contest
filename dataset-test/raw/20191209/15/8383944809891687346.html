      <p>Syrian regime leader Bashar Assad's uncle went on trial in Paris Monday on charges of pilfering Syrian state coffers and using the spoils to build a property empire in France.</p>
      <p>The dock was empty as the hearing got underway, with lawyers for 82-year-old Rifaat Assad citing health problems as the reason for his absence.</p>
      <p>"His doctors have recommended that he avoids all stressful situations," lawyer Pierre Cornut-Gentille told the Paris court.</p>
      <p>Rifaat Assad, dubbed the "Butcher of Hama" for commanding troops that put down an uprising in central Syria in 1982, has been under investigation in France since 2014.</p>
      <p>This year, an investigating magistrate ordered he stand trial on charges of organized money laundering related to his 90-million-euro ($99.5-million) property portfolio in France.</p>
      <p>The trial of the younger brother of Syrian ex-president Hafez Assad -- the current president's father -- is scheduled to last until Dec. 18.</p>
      <p>It concerns crimes allegedly committed between 1984 and 2016, including aggravated tax fraud and misappropriation of Syrian funds.</p>
      <p>Assad, who splits his time between France and Britain, denies the charges.</p>
      <p>Formerly Syria's vice-president, Assad left his home country in 1984 after mounting a failed coup against his brother Hafez, who led Syria from 1971 to 2000.</p>
      <p>After he arrived in Europe, Rifaat Assad's lavish lifestyle, four wives, and 16 children soon raised eyebrows.</p>
      <p>His reported French fortune includes two Paris townhouses, one measuring 3,000 square meters (32,000 square feet), as well as a stud farm, a chateau and 7,300 square meters of office space in Lyon.</p>
      <p>He and his family also built up a huge portfolio of 507 properties in Spain, valued at around 695 million euros, Spanish legal documents show. All his properties in that country were seized by the authorities in 2017.</p>
      <p>Assad has maintained that his lifestyle was made possible by gifts from the Saudi royal family that amounted to more than a million dollars per month.</p>
      <p>But despite documents from Assad's lawyers meant to justify gifts of almost $25 million between 1984 and 2010, French investigators registered transfers of only $10 million from Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>This is only the second trial of a foreign dignitary in France on charges related to "ill-gotten gains."</p>
      <p>The first, Equatorial Guinea vice-president Teodorin Obiang, received a three-year suspended jail term in October 2017 after being convicted of using public money to fund a jet-set lifestyle in Paris.</p>
      <p>Paris has long been a favored destination for the corrupt gains of wealthy figures linked to political leaders in Africa, particularly in France's former colonies.</p>
