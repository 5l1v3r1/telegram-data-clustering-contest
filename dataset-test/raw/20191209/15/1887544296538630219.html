      <p>A 26-year-old Ajax man has been charged with attempted murder after a male victim was stabbed numerous times outside an Oshawa convenience store last Saturday, in what investigators say started as a cell phone theft.</p>
      <p>Durham Regional Police say they were called to the Smoke Ways convenience store on King Street East at 4:30 p.m. for a report of a disturbance inside.</p>
      <p>Police said a male suspect inside the store “became enraged” and allegedly began knocking over store shelves.</p>
      <p>He then went outside the store and got into a fight with a 53-year-old man.</p>
      <p>In the confrontation, the suspect allegedly took the victim’s cell phone, which had fallen to the ground.</p>
      <p>When the victim confronted the suspect to get his phone back, he was stabbed several times.</p>
      <p>Police got to the scene and found the victim in a parking lot, he was rushed to a Toronto hospital trauma centre where he remains in serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>The suspect approached the front desk at the Durham Regional Police station in Oshawa approximately one hour later and turned himself in.</p>
      <p>He was identified by police as Tyler Dupont.</p>
      <p>He was charged with attempted murder, robbery, weapons dangerous and mischief.</p>
      <p>Dupont was held in custody pending a bail hearing.</p>
