      <p>Rev. Karen Clark Ristine is the new pastor at Claremont United Methodist Church, where they’re known for their topical, non-traditional nativity scenes with a provocative message.</p>
      <p>“I knew about that before I was assigned to come here, and I was excited about it.” Ristine said. “What would happen today if the holy family showed up at our borders seeking asylum?”</p>
      <p>Thousands of families seeking asylum in the U.S. were separated at the border.</p>
      <p>Separating Jesus, Mary and Joseph is certainly getting the desired reaction among those drawn to the display by social media posts.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen a nativity scene like this. It’s making a very bold statement,” Judi Rivera said.</p>
      <p>“I can totally see it being controversial,” Lars Schmitz said. “It really makes me think. In a way, it puts a mirror in front of us right now, and so that bothers me.”</p>
      <p>The Maung family, who recently emigrated from Burma, said this brings back some sad memories of their homeland,</p>
      <p>“People are separated and arrested,” Chowa Maung said. “Yeah, we saw some families like this.”</p>
      <p>But what about separation of church and state? Is this crossing a line?</p>
      <p>Ristine doesn’t see it as a political statement. Yet many who posted on her Facebook page disagree.</p>
      <p>One wrote “inappropriate and incredibly false analogy ... Using the nativity scene for political agendas is wrong. Ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>Inside the church was no statement at all, simply the traditional nativity scene.</p>
