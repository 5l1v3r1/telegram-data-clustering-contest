      <h1>Nicolas Bourbaki: One of the greatest mathematicians of 20th century never really existed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Gunderman, The Conversation</a></address>
      <p>By many measures, Nicolas Bourbaki ranks among the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.</p>
      <p>Largely unknown today, Bourbaki is likely the last mathematician to master nearly all aspects of the field. A consummate collaborator, he made fundamental contributions to important mathematical fields such as set theory and functional analysis. He also revolutionised mathematics by emphasising rigour in place of conjecture.</p>
      <p>There’s just one problem: Nicolas Bourbaki never existed.</p>
      <h3>Never existed?</h3>
      <p>While it is now widely accepted that there never was a Nicolas Bourbaki, there is evidence to the contrary. For example, there are <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/when-was-the-bourbaki-wedding">wedding announcements</a> for his daughter Betty, a baptismal certificate in his name and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03028596">an impressive family lineage</a> extending back to an ancestor Napoleon raised as his own son.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/mathematical-apocrypha">Even the professional mathematics community</a> was misled for a time. When Ralph Boas, an editor of the journal <i>Mathematical Reviews</i>, wrote that Bourbaki was a pseudonym, he was promptly refuted by none other than Bourbaki himself. Bourbaki countered with a letter stating that BOAS actually just was an acronym of the last names of the editors of the <i>Reviews</i>.</p>
      <p>These cases of confused identity were not all fun and games. For example, <a href="https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/912">it is alleged</a> that, while visiting Finland at the outset of World War II, French mathematician André Weil was investigated for spying. The authorities found suspicious papers in his possession: a fake identity, a set of business cards and even invitations from the Russian Academy of Science – all in Bourbaki’s name. Supposedly, Weil was freed only after an officer recognised him as a preeminent mathematician.</p>
      <h3>Who was Bourbaki?</h3>
      <p>If Bourbaki never existed, who – or what – was he? The name <a href="http://www.mcs.csueastbay.edu/~malek/Mathlinks/Bourbaki.html">Nicolas Bourbaki</a> first appeared in a place rocked by turmoil at a volatile time in history: Paris in 1934.</p>
      <p>World War I had wiped out a generation of French intellectuals. As a result, the standard university-level calculus textbook had been written more than two and half decades before and was out of date.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199803/borel.pdf">Newly-minted professors André Weil and Henri Cartan</a> wanted a rigorous method to teach Stokes’ theorem, a key result of calculus. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03025255">After realising that others had similar concerns</a>, Weil organised a meeting. It took place December 10, 1934, at a Parisian café called Capoulade.</p>

      <p>The nine mathematicians in attendance <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IieQDwAAQBAJ&amp;ppis=_e&amp;dq=%22to+define+for+25+years+the+syllabus+for+the+certificate+in+differential+and+integral+calculus+by+writing,+collectively,+a+treatise+on+analysis,%E2%80%9D&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">agreed to write a textbook</a> “to define for 25 years the syllabus for the certificate in differential and integral calculus by writing, collectively, a treatise on analysis,” which they hoped to complete in just six months.</p>
      <p>As a joke, they named themselves after an <a href="https://www.bourbakipanorama.ch/en/museum/history/">old French general</a> who had been duped in the Franco-Prussian war.</p>
      <p>As they proceeded, their original goal of elucidating Stokes’ theorem expanded to laying out the foundations of all mathematics. Eventually, they began to hold regular Bourbaki “conferences” three times a year to discuss new chapters for the treatise.</p>
      <p>Individual members were encouraged to engage with all aspects of the effort, to ensure that the treatise would be accessible to nonspecialists. <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Dieudonne(2).pdf">According to one of the founders</a>, spectators invariably came away with the impression that they were witnessing “a gathering of madmen.” They could not imagine how people, shouting – “sometimes three or four at the same time” – could ever come up with something “intelligent.”</p>
      <p>Top mathematicians from across Europe, intrigued by the group’s work and style, joined to augment the group’s ranks. Over time, the name Bourbaki became a collective pseudonym for dozens of influential mathematicians spanning generations, including Weil, Dieudonne, Schwartz, Borel, Grothendieck and many others.</p>
      <p>Since then, the group which has added new members over time, has proved to have a profound impact on mathematics, certainly rivaling any of its individual contributors.</p>

      <h3>Profound impact</h3>
      <p>Mathematicians have made a plethora of important contributions under Bourbaki’s name. To name a few, the group introduced the null set symbol; the ubiquitous terms injective, surjective, bijective; and generalisations of many important theorems, including the Bourbaki-Witt theorem, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0315-0860(78)90136-2">Jacobson-Bourbaki</a> theorem and the Bourbaki-Banach-Alaoglu theorem.</p>
      <p>Their text, <i>Elements of Mathematics</i>, has swelled to more than 6,000 pages. It provides a “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00283-017-9763-5">solid foundation for the whole body of modern mathematics</a>,” according to mathematician Barbara Pieronkiewicz.</p>

      <p>Bourbaki’s influence is still alive and well. Now in “his” 80th year of research, in 2016 “he” published the 11th volume of the <i>Elements of Mathematics</i>. The Bourbaki group, with its ever-changing cast of members, still holds <a href="http://www.bourbaki.ens.fr/seminaires/2020/index.html#seminaire">regular seminars</a> at the University of Paris.</p>
      <p>Partly thanks to the breadth and significance of “his” mathematical contributions, and also because – ageless, unchanging and operating in multiple places at once – “he” seems to defy the very laws of physics, Bourbaki’s mathematical prowess will likely never be equaled.</p>
