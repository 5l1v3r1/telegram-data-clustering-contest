      <p><i>Minecraft</i> on the PlayStation 4 is finally getting updated to the unified Bedrock Edition on December 10th. The new update will enable cross-platform play between the Xbox One, Windows 10 PCs, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, Gear VR, and now PS4. <i>Minecraft</i> players on the PS4 will also get access to all of their purchases and progress, and the update will be available free of charge.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is starting to roll out the Bedrock Edition to PS4 just months after Sony brought its PS4 cross-play support <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/playstation-now-updates/">officially out of beta</a>. It also comes two years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339242/minecraft-cross-platform-update-better-together-windows-10-pc-mobile-switch-xbox">cross-play was available</a> for <i>Minecraft </i>on Xbox, PC, mobile, and the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453628/fortnite-nintendo-switch-cross-play-sony-ps4-microsoft-xbox-one-e3-2018">Sony previously blocked cross-play</a> for titles like <i>Minecraft</i> and <i>Fortnite</i>, and after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15807138/sony-playstation-cross-network-play-xbox-block-response">significant <i>Fortnite</i> backlash</a>, the company eventually backed down and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17905146/sony-fortnite-ps4-cross-play-support">changed its policies</a> in September 2018. Since then, <i>Fortnite</i>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182389/rocket-league-cross-play-enabled-ps4-switch-xbox-pc"><i>Rocket League</i></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20812212/pubg-cross-play-xbox-one-date"><i>PUBG</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873038/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-cross-play-beta-how-it-works-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a> have all included cross-play.</p>

      <p>“One of <i>Minecraft’s</i> core missions is to connect players across devices and provide the best experience regardless of platform,” says <i>Minecraft</i> studio head Helen Chiang, in a statement to <i>The Verge</i>. “We continue to fulfill that mission here today by welcoming PS4 players to <i>Minecraft</i> on Bedrock and growing our cross-platform multiplayer community.”</p>
