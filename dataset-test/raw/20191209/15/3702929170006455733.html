      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Former MIC president Tun S. Samy Vellu’s son has filed a legal proceeding to determine his father's mental health which allegedly has been deteriorating over the last two years.</p>
      <p>Datuk Seri S. Vell Paari, through Messrs Mathews Hun Lachimanan, has named his father as the sole defendant in his originating summons filed at the High Court on Dec 2.</p>
      <p>According to the summons, the former MIC vice-president wants the court to determine when his father’s mental health deteriorated and whether Samy Vellu was capable of giving instructions to his counsel.</p>
      <p>Vell Paari, who is Samy Vellu’s eldest son, also wants to know all the properties owned by his 82-year-old father.</p>
      <p>The plaintiff also is seeking Penang Adventist Hospital Neurobehavioural Medicine head Dr Prem Kumar Chandrasekaran or any expert in mental health to examine his father’s mental condition.</p>
      <p>“This is to ensure that a report on the defendant’s mental health can be produced under Section 54 of Mental Health Act 2001.</p>
      <p>“If the defendant is mentally disordered, we are seeking the court to appoint lawyer Datuk C. Vijaya Kumar and Vell Paari or anyone deemed fit by the court to be appointed to a committee to organise his estate,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Vell Paari is also seeking an order from the court to declare him as a litigant in representing his father.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old politician in his supporting affidavit said Samy Vellu’s mental health had deteriorated since 2017.</p>
      <p>“Psychiatrist consultant from Victoria, Professor David Ames, declared that my father suffered from dementia.</p>
      <p>“Ames’ finding is also supported by his counterpart from Pantai Hospital Dr V. Bharathi who had interviewed my father in March, April and May this year.</p>
      <p>“His finding stated that my father suffered from Alzheimer's disease and he was not capable of managing his estates, medication, and decision making,” he said, adding that his mother and sister knew about the originating summons.</p>
      <p>Vell Paari said his father's former mistress known as Meeriam had initiated a legal proceeding against him and his father at the Ipoh High Court.</p>
      <p>“Meeriam is trying to take advantage of my father’s condition and trying to cross-examine him even though he did not affirm any affidavit.</p>
      <p>“Meeriam is an opportunist and trying to stain my father’s name to extort his money for her own benefit.</p>
      <p>“I believe my father is incapable of defending himself via affidavit or through written or oral evidence,” he said.</p>
      <p>He sought to have this inquiry disposed before Meeriam’s suit as it could effect the latter’s proceedings.</p>
