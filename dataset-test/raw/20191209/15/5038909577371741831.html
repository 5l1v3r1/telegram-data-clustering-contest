      <p>© EDITOR — It is sad to note that most local authorities are failing to provide essential services throughout the country.<br/>The economy is in bad shape, everyone knows that. Residents are struggling to service their bills.</p>
      <p>For this reason, local authorities’ revenue bases are dwindling.<br/>Under such a scenario, we would expect those at the helm to tighten spending and channel the little revenue trickling their way to essential services provision. </p>
      <p>At least that is what is supposed to happen anyway because at the end of the day, councils are there to provide services for residents.</p>
      <p>The opposite of this, however, is what we are seeing happening and Harare City Council is the biggest culprit.<br/>The council has been hogging the limelight for all the wrong reasons. It is important to note that service provision in Harare is almost non-existent.</p>
      <p>There are perennial shortages of water, raw sewage flowing on the streets, burst water pipes and rubbish is everywhere. <br/>Right now, the quality of water running through our taps is appalling and only the grace of God is saving us.</p>
      <p>The city fathers do not seem to care. For a council that is dogged by poor service provision, you can’t have the greatest chunk of the little revenue going towards salaries and wages. </p>
