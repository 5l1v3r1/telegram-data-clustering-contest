      <h1>Sweden charges former China envoy over Gin Minhai meetings</h1>

      <p>Sweden’s former ambassador to China has been charged after holding unauthorised meetings in Stockholm aimed at freeing dissident bookseller Gui Minhai.</p>
      <p>Anna Lindstedt is suspected of organising a meeting in January between Gui’s daughter, two businessmen and China's ambassador about the possible release of her father.</p>
      <p>Hans Ihrman, <a href="https://www.aklagare.se/en/news-and-press/press-releases/?newsId=3266744">Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor at the National Security Unit</a> said Lindstedt “exceeded her mandate and has therefore rendered herself criminally liable”.</p>
      <p>The charge against Lindstedt “during negotiations with a foreign power is unprecedented in modern times”.</p>
      <p>The former ambassador allegedly told Angela Gui that she should fly to Stockholm to explore a “new approach” to her father’s case. It is alleged that the businessmen in attendance could arrange a Chinese visa for her and connect her with China’s ruling Communist Party.</p>
      <p>Angela Gui later said in her blog that she was advised to keep quiet about her father's case while negotiations were proceeding.</p>
      <p>Anna Lindstedt was replaced as ambassador in February amid a furore over her alleged role in setting up the meetings. Sweden's Foreign Ministry said it had no advance knowledge of the meeting.</p>
      <p>In a written statement to Swedish news agency TT, Lindstedt's lawyer said that she rejected the accusation.</p>
      <p>“Ambassadors must adhere to certain guidelines and instructions” issued by the Swedish Government and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Ihrman.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the ambassador was launched in February after the Swedish Security Service filed a criminal complaint.</p>

      <h3>Who is Gui Minhai?</h3>
      <p>Swedish citizen Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong-based publisher of books critical of China's communist leaders, went missing in Thailand in 2015.</p>
      <p>He was released in October 2017, but his whereabouts were unclear until January last year when his daughter said he was seized by Chinese agents on a Beijing-bound train in the presence of Swedish diplomats.</p>
      <p>China later confirmed it had detained him again, on suspicion of revealing state secrets and intelligence on China.</p>
      <p>Stockholm has accused China of preventing Sweden giving consular support to Gui, which Beijing rejects, and relations between the two countries have turned frosty.</p>
      <p>In November, China's ambassador to Sweden threatened to blacklist Swedish Minister of Culture Amanda Lind for attending a literary award ceremony in Stockholm where Gui was honoured.</p>
