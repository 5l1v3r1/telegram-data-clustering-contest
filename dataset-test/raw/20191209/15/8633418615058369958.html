      <p>Mojang took to the <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/12/09/minecraft-bedrock-version-coming-to-ps4">PlayStation Blog</a> today to officially announce Bedrock is finally coming to the PlayStation 4 tomorrow, December 10, just as <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/minecraft-bedrock-edition-may-be-coming-to-playstation-4-enabling-cross-play">recent leaks</a> had predicted. The game that's currently available on the Sony console will be getting the new version as an update, bumping it up to version 1.14, which is the upcoming <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/buzzy-bees">Buzzy Bees</a> release.</p>
      <p>Alongside feature parity with all other versions, the biggest new addition that Bedrock brings to the PlayStation 4 is cross-play support. Now, PlayStation 4 players will all be able to play together with Windows 10, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, mobile, and other version players - who are also on update 1.14 - in the same multiplayer servers.</p>

      <p>Access to Minecraft Marketplace is incoming too, letting PlayStation players purchase worlds, skins, mash-up packs, and more through the in-game store. See the new cross-play showcase Better Together trailer above.</p>
      <p>Since this will be delivered as an update tomorrow, slated to land at 8AM PST, all existing owners will be upgraded to the new version without needing to purchase anything. Anyone purchasing a new copy of <i>Minecraft on </i>PlayStation 4 will also be jumping into the Bedrock version from the start.</p>
