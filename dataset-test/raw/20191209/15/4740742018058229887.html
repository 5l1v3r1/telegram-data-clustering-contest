      <p>Banksy has painted a new mural in Birmingham - and he revealed it by posting a poignant video of a homeless man on Instagram.</p>
      <p>The anonymous Bristolian artist has painted the piece on a Vyse Street brick wall in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter.</p>
      <p>Footage posted to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/banksy">Banksy's</a> Instagram page today (December 9) shows a homeless man called Ryan having a drink before settling down on a bench next to a bin.</p>

      <p>The camera moves back to reveal a mural of reindeer, who appear ready to lift Ryan into a starry sky.</p>
      <p>The Instagram message reads: â€œGod bless Birmingham. In the 20 minutes we filmed Ryan on this bench passers-by gave him a hot drink, two chocolate bars and a lighter - without him ever asking for anything. #Banksy."</p>

      <p>A host of passers-by have been pictured posing on the bench since the painting appeared.</p>
      <p>Banksy first made his name in the 1990s when he broke out onto Bristol's underground graffiti scene.</p>
      <p>His largest canvas painting was unveiled in Bristol Museum in March, almost a decade after it was last shown there.</p>
      <p>'Devolved Parliament', which shows the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/authors/patrick-daly/">House of Commons</a> filled with chimps, was displayed in the museum until September.</p>
