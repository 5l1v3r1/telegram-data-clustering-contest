      <p>This is the moment a wildlife photographer found himself ambushed by a curious leopard cub after it sauntered over to check out his boot.</p>
      <p>Game ranger Dillon Nelson was filming a mother leopard and her young daughter when the inquisitive cub decided to get a closer look.</p>
      <p>The 10-month-old cub climbed down from a termite mound in Sabi Sands nature reserve, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/south_africa/index.html"><b>South Africa</b></a>, and ended up inches away from Mr Nelson.</p>

      <p>The photographer froze as the young leopard investigated his boot before staring him down and letting out a defensive hiss.</p>
      <p>Mr Nelson, 25, said: 'I work in the area as a game ranger or nature guide and take people out on safari and bush walks.</p>
      <p>'We were following a resident female leopard and her 10-month-old cub as they moved through a very dense monkey orange and bush willow thicket.</p>

        <figcaption>Then the curious cub decides to get a closer look at Mr Nelson's boot, venturing away from its mother and moving just inches away from him</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'She was presumably taking the cub on a walkabout, teaching her some skills about hunting and stalking prey.</p>
      <p>'The adult went up on to this termite mound to get a better look at her surroundings, with the youngster following right behind.</p>
      <p>'With the cub being quite young and inquisitive she came to investigate what my shoe might be, possibly thinking or hoping it was a scrub hare or squirrel.</p>

        <figcaption>The cub nibbles on a blade of dried grass and seems to be in a non-threatening mood as it looks directly into the camera lens</figcaption>

      <p>'I was quite nervous but more excited than anything else. It's hard to describe how it felt during the sighting because I was trying to keep calm and take in what was happening.</p>
      <p>'As I saw her approaching I already knew it was too late for me to move. I thought I should just keep still and allow her to investigate.</p>
      <p>'She saw what she needed and then proceeded on her way. Definitely a thrilling experience, and one not many people get to have.'</p>
