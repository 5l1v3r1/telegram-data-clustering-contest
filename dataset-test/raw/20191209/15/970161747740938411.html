        <b>The new Ghostbusters Afterlife trailer has finally arrived and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>’ Paul Rudd and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a>’ Finn Wolfhard are out to bring back the stylings of the original film.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Afterlife stars Paul, Finn, Carrie Coon, and Mckenna Grace, who move to a tiny town and soon discover the hidden secrets.</p>
      <p>In true reboot fashion, they soon follow the path left behind by the original Ghostbusters movies.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we can barely see the ghosts in the trailer as they zoom by at lightning speeds but we’re hoping that, with modern technology, they are just a spookier version of their original cartoonish selves.</p>
      <p>The latest film is directed by Jason Reitman who is also the son of the original Ghostbusters director, Ivan Reitman, so we can only expect great things.</p>
      <p>Several of the original movie’s cast members are set to reprise their roles including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson.</p>

      <p>You heard that right, Bill Murray’s back.</p>
      <p>Afterlife will be the fourth movie in the franchise and, yes, we just got a reboot of it in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 2016 version was an all-female reboot that Ivan claims takes place in a different storytelling universe, and people were not happy with it.</p>
      <p>This film seems to be totally ignoring any existence of the female film – which starred Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig – but we don’t totally blame them after the extreme backlash.</p>
      <p>Here’s to hoping the latest one exceeds our expectations.</p>
      <p>The original film, released in 1984, took in more than $295million (£224m) at the box office.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife hits cinemas on 10 July 2020 in the US and UK.</i>
