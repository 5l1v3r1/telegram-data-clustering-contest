      <p>If you're prone to picturing your favorite Christmas characters as stop-motion puppets, you can thank Rankin/Bass. The production company founded by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass found success in transforming holiday songs and myths into fully-developed television specials in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. Their most popular specials, like <i><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72048/12-very-shiny-facts-about-rudolph-red-nosed-reindeer">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a></i> and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72865/8-jolly-happy-facts-about-frosty-snowman"><i>Frosty the Snowman</i></a>, are still staples of holiday programming decades after they first aired.</p>
      <p>But not every holiday film that played under the Rankin/Bass banner was an instant success. After adapting the most beloved Christmas stories, the company broadened its definition of holiday material, with varying degrees of success. Some films were forgettable, and others were so strange and unsettling that young viewers forced themselves to forget. Here are some Rankin/Bass specials that may be missing from holiday television marathons this year.</p>
      <h3>1. Rudolph’s Shiny New Year (1976)</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>After the stressful events of his 1964 Christmas special, Rudolph deserved a vacation. In <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073640/"><i>Rudolph's Shiny New Year</i></a><i> </i>(1976), the red-nosed reindeer barely has a day to rest before being sent on his next adventure. When Santa Claus and his reindeer return home to the North Pole after delivering presents on Christmas, they learn that Happy the Baby New Year is missing. It’s up to Rudolph to bring him home before midnight on New Year’s Eve or else the calendar will be stuck at December 31. And because it wouldn’t be a Rankin/Bass cartoon without a terrifying villain, a vulture named Eon the Terrible is racing to catch Happy first so he can live forever. Thankfully, Rudolph has a caveman, a Medieval knight, and Benjamin Franklin on his side.</p>
      <h3>2. The Little Drummer Boy, Book II (1976)</h3>

      <p><i>The Little Drummer Boy</i> from 1968 ends with the birth of Jesus Christ, a.k.a. the events of Christmas. This meant that Rankin/Bass’s most overtly religious Christmas special wasn’t an obvious choice for a follow-up, but the studio still released one in 1976. <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/every-rankinbass-christmas-special-ranked"><i>The Little Drummer Boy, Book II</i></a> is inspired by "Silver Bells"—a song whose lyrics have nothing to do with the first Christmas at Bethlehem. In the sequel, the drummer boy Aaron and the wise man Melchior join forces to protect silver bells made for baby Jesus from the Roman soldiers plotting to steal them.</p>
      <h3>3. Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey (1977)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868038/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass16.jpg?itok=eySLzaMz"/>

      <p>By the late 1970s, it was apparent that Rankin/Bass was running out of Christmas myths to expand into television specials. <i>Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey</i>, their 1977 stop motion film, tells the story of an outcast donkey who experiences a series of traumatic events during the Roman Empire. After being bullied by other animals, left for dead by his owner, and <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2015/12/rankin-bass-stop-motion-christmas-specials-santa-claus-rudolph-frosty-the-snowman-nightmares-45105/">suffering</a> the loss of his mother, Nestor becomes a hero by carrying a pregnant Mary to Bethlehem, where she gives birth to Jesus. Needless to say, <i>Nestor, the Long-Eared Donkey</i> didn’t have the same cultural impact as <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i>.</p>
      <h3>4. The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow (1975)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868192/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass2_1.jpg?itok=CILPFdpr"/>

      <p>It may have a happy ending, but <i>The First Christmas</i> (1975) is the bleakest movie on this list. An orphaned shepherd named Lucas is taken in by a group of nuns after he’s blinded by lightning. When snow falls during the abbey’s Christmas pageant, Lucas miraculously regains his eyesight and sees snow for the first time. The story swaps Rankin/Bass's signature humor and fantasy for heavy-handed sentimentality, which may be why it didn’t land as well with kids as the company’s other holiday specials. One highlight is a voice performance by Angela Lansbury as the narrator.</p>
      <h3>5. Jack Frost (1979)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868248/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass56.jpg?itok=C1cNuMtu"/>

      <p>So this film from 1979 is technically a Groundhog Day special, but its connection to winter means it’s usually lumped in with the rest of Rankin/Bass’s Christmas programming. A groundhog named Pardon-Me-Pete (voiced by Buddy Hackett) narrates the story of Jack Frost. After Jack Frost falls in love with a woman on Earth, Father Winter agrees to make him human, with the catch that Jack will turn back into a sprite if he fails to obtain a house, a horse, a bag of gold, and a wife by the first sign of spring. The special is notable for its weird characters, including a villain with a clockwork horse and henchmen. And—<i>spoiler alert!</i>—because Jack doesn’t get the girl at the end, it’s one of the few Rankin/Bass films that doesn’t have a happy ending.</p>
      <h3>6. Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July (1979)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868336/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass0.jpg?itok=W8ZjbhtY"/>

      <p>In 1979, Rankin/Bass gave two of its most iconic Christmas characters—Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer—their own movie. The studio was so confident in the product that<i> Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July</i> even had a brief <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/rankin-bass-has-its-own-avengers-and-its-a-must-watch-1831177105">theatrical release</a> overseas. But the film has failed to take the place of the original specials in the public consciousness—maybe because seeing snow snakes terrorize Rudolph and watching an evil wizard transform into a tree were too much for younger viewers to handle.</p>
      <h3>7. Pinocchio's Christmas (1980)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868407/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass1.jpg?itok=I7ebqR23"/>

      <p>The story of Pinocchio may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Christmas, but that didn’t stop Rankin/Bass from turning the classic Italian fairytale into a holiday special. <i>Pinocchio's Christmas</i> (1980) features many of the same themes and characters as <i>The Adventures of Pinocchio</i>—only this version of the tale centers around the puppet’s first Christmas. Santa Claus even makes a cameo appearance.</p>
      <h3>8. The Stingiest Man in Town (1978)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868481/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass12.png?itok=q_5ifkug"/>

      <p>Charles Dickens’s <i>A Christmas Carol</i> is one of the most <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/90009/supercut-fits-400-versions-christmas-carol-one-movie">widely adapted</a> stories of all time, so of course it shows up in Rankin/Bass’s filmography. An insect named B.A.H. Humbug narrates this musical retelling from 1978, with Walter Matthau starring as Ebeneezer Scrooge.<i> The Stingiest Man in Town</i> joins <i>Frosty the Snowman</i> as one of the few Rankin/Bass Christmas productions made with traditional 2D animation instead of stop-motion.</p>
      <h3>9. The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold (1981)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868550/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass5.jpg?itok=9XAoswaR"/>

      <p>Rankin/Bass’s streak of mashing up Christmas with other holidays reached peak weirdness in 1981. That’s when the studio released <i>The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold</i>—a story that follows a young Irish sailor who helps a clan of leprechauns protect their gold from an evil banshee named Old Mag the Hag. By trying to create a special that could air around Christmas and St. Patrick’s Day, the filmmakers ended up with something that made little sense at any time of year.</p>
      <h3>10. The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1985)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1574868617/shape/mentalfloss/609505-rankinbass3.jpg?itok=OWdB2-M8"/>

      <p>In 1970, Rankin/Bass explored how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus with <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/santa-claus-comin-town-4-fun-facts-about-classic-christmas-movie-2196897"><i>Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town</i></a>. Fifteen years later, the studio produced a film that provided an alternate origin story for the character, based on L. Frank Baum's 1902 children's book of the same name. This second special wasn’t as well-received as the first. It starts with an antler-sporting sorcerer called the Great Ak finding an abandoned baby in the forest. The child is taken in and raised by wood nymphs, eventually growing up to become a jolly man who delivers toys to children—all while fighting monsters called Awgwas on the side. It ends with a council of mythical beings granting Santa Claus immortality. What was arguably Rankin/Bass’s most unusual Christmas special was also the last to use stop-motion animation.</p>
