      <h1>Holly and Phil take selfies as they brush off 'complaints' row</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:32:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Deen</a></address>
      <p>Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby spent Monday’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> taking selfies together at a Christmas fair as they continued to brush off the ‘complaints’ row currently surrounding the pair.</p>
      <p>Reports over the weekend alleged that some <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/phillip-schofield-breaks-silence-following-claims-morning-presenters-complain-attitude-11410682/">presenters have ‘complained about Phil’s behaviour’.</a></p>
      <p>The pair’s working relationship is also said to have become ‘strained over recent months’, The Sun has claimed.</p>
      <p>But there were no signs of any strain as the presenters took a ride on a Ferris wheel during Monday’s episode of This Morning.</p>
      <p>Wrapped up warm against the chilly December weather, Holly and Phil posed for selfies on the wheel as today’s installment got started.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the two hour show they were joined by celebrity guests such as Aled Jones, Russell Watson and Martin Lewis.</p>
      <p>Neither of the presenters, who are famously close and often go on holiday together, addressed the allegations about Phil on the programme.</p>
      <p>According to The Sun a handful of ITV faces have spoken about the alleged ‘toxic’ atmosphere behind the scenes.</p>

      <p>Loose Women panelist Ruth Langsford, who hosts This Morning with husband Eamonn Holmes on Fridays, is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/ruth-langsford-throws-pen-fury-loose-women-cut-off-phillip-schofield-11480365/?ito=twitter">reported to have made an official complaint</a> about the 5 Gold Rings presenter.</p>
      <p>It comes after Amanda Holden weighed in about what was going on during her show with Jamie Theakston on Heart Breakfast.</p>
      <p>The Britain’s Got Talent star insisted she had put any issues with Phil behind her, however she did appear to back Ruth.</p>
      <p>She said: Listen, I’ve drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip.</p>

      <p>‘Well, I’m just gonna say that I really admire anyone who sticks up for themselves because it’s not an easy thing to do.</p>
      <p>‘There is a tin opener and there’s a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener. That’s all I’m saying.’</p>
      <p>Her comments followed rumours that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/23/phillip-schofield-defends-amid-claims-blocked-amanda-holdens-morning-gig-hope-know-better-10034230/">Schofe ‘blocked’ Amanda from replacing Holly on This Morning</a> when she joined Dec Donnelly on I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! last year.</p>
      <p>Instead Phil was joined by Rochelle Humes while Holly was away.</p>
