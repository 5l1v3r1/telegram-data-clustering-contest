      <p>Ghanaian singer and Rufftown records signee, Wendy Shay and former Bhim Native, Kelvynboy have quashed their beef that erupted during the Shatta Wale-Stonebwoy peace conference.</p>
      <p>The two singers got entangled in public fracas after the joint press conference held by Stonebwoy and Shatta Wale at Marriott Hotel in Accra on June 4, 2019, to squash their long-standing beef.</p>
      <p>The humiliating incident occurred when Kelvynboy was invited to join the photoshoot immediately after the conference.</p>
      <p>He tried to shake hands with Stonebwoy, Shatta Wale and Bullet but Kelvynboy rebuffed the “Uber” driver hitmaker when she attempted to hug him.</p>
      <p>This caused the public to react and this started the beginning of another industry beef after one had ended. Shots were thrown from both camps with Bullet alleging that Kelvynboy snubbed his artist because of an award.</p>
      <p>Well, the dust has finally settled as the ‘Uber Driver’ hitmaker together with her manager and Kelvynboy reconciled on Sunday, December 8 during Ghana Stands In Worship at the Charismatic Anointing Ministries International.</p>
      <p>In a viral video, Kelvynboy, before he mounted the stage at the church to sing, gave Wendy Shay and Bullet a hug and a big smile to indicate that ait’s all love.</p>
