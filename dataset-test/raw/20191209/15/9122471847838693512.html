      <h1>Tom Brady Posts Simple Message After Loss To The Chiefs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:49:49+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>If there’s one thing we all know about Patriots QB Tom Brady, it’s that he won’t let a loss detour him from the team’s goals. New England’s defeat to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday was ugly. But Brady is bound to come back better than ever.</p>
      <p>The Patriots’ quarterback took to Twitter to post a simple message after the loss. Brady’s clearly already moved on and is ready to get back to winning.</p>
      <p>“We’re on to Cincinnati.”</p>

      <p>Fortunately for Brady and the Patriots, they’ll face the Cincinnati Bengals this upcoming Sunday. An easy opponent and a chance to bounce back after a tough loss to the Chiefs.</p>
      <p>While New England will be big favorites over the Bengals on Sunday, the team’s long term outlook isn’t as optimistic as years past. The Patriots’ performance against the Chiefs exposed several glaringly obvious weaknesses, specifically in the passing game.</p>
      <p>If Brady wants to add another Super Bowl ring to his already impressive collection, New England needs to find answers on offense. But as things currently stand in the AFC, the Ravens and Chiefs remain the favorites to represent the conference in the Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>Yet, with a duo like Brady and coach Bill Belichick, you can never count the Patriots out. It’ll be interesting to see how the team responds this upcoming Sunday.</p>
