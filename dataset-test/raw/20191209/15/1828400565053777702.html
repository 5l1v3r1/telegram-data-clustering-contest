      <p>The Seasiders were originally scheduled to take on the Trotters on Saturday, January 4 2020.</p>
      <p>However, that fixture had to be postponed due to Blackpool's progression in the FA Cup, as they will now take on Championship side Reading on that date.</p>
      <p>The rearranged encounter with Bolton will now take place on Tuesday, February 25 (7.45pm kick-off).</p>
      <p>The midweek game will be sandwiched in between a trip to AFC Wimbledon on Saturday, February 22 and the home game against Ipswich Town the following Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Seasiders drew 0-0 with Bolton in the corresponding fixture earlier in the season.</p>
