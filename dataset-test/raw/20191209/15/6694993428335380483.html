      <p>A man arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence during the Manchester derby between City and United at the Etihad Stadium has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Police said investigations would continue.</p>
      <p>Anthony Burke, 41, a father from Wythenshawe, was arrested after Saturday's match.</p>
      <p>He has now been released from custody after questioning, the force confirmed.</p>
      <p>United midfielder Fred appeared to have objects thrown towards him in the second half of the Premier League clash as he went over to take a corner.</p>
      <p>Television images then showed what appeared to be a supporter making potentially racist gestures as Fred walked away, holding the back of his head. The video was widely circulated on social media.</p>
