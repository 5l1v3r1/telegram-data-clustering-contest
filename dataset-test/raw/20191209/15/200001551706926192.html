      <h1>Director to start operation to sign Norwich City player during next window</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.fotomac.com.tr/galeri/fenerbahce/volkan-demirelden-fenerbahceye-2-bomba-birden-ikisi-de-cok-iyi-alalim">Fotomac</a> report Fenerbahce assistant coach Volkan Demirel has urged the Super Lig club to sign Norwich City forward Teemu Pukki in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Finnish striker has been a key player for Daniel Farke’s side this season and in recent matches he’s rediscovered his scoring touch</p>
      <p>According to Fotomac, Fenerbahce will try their luck in signing Pukki because Demirel was impressed with what he saw of the Norwich City attacker during the last international break. Finland qualified for next summer’s Euros, which will be the country’s first major tournament.</p>
      <p>Following Demirel’s advice, Fenerbahce sporting director Damien Comolli will now begin the operation to sign Pukki in the new year.</p>
      <p>However, with the Canaries in a relegation fight it’s unlikely they will allow an important player to leave halfway through the season.</p>
      <p>The 29 year old has made 16 appearances for Norwich City in the Premier League this season, scoring eight goals. His contract at Carrow Road will expire at the end of June 2022.</p>
