      <h1>'We demand proof, not promises': Papuans urge Jokowi to bring justice to Paniai tragedy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:12:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">Benny Mawel</a></address>
      <p>University students and human rights activists staged a rally on Sunday in Sorong, West Papua, demanding that President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo fulfill his vow to settle a human rights violation case in Paniai, Papua.</p>
      <p>Five people, including four high school students, were allegedly shot and killed by Indonesian Military (TNI) soldiers on Dec. 8, 2014, during a protest in Paniai.</p>
      <p>Five years later, demonstrators gathered at the Sorong urban park and put up leaflets that read, “We demand proof, not promises”.</p>
      <p>They called for the prosecution of those responsible for the shooting.</p>
      <p>“Papua does not need [more] security [personnel]. Papua only needs justice,” protesters chanted during the rally, demanding that the government show respect to Papuans “as human beings”.</p>
      <p>Jokowi promised to uphold justice and resolve the case in a speech delivered at a  Christmas celebration in Papua’s provincial capital of Jayapura on Dec. 27, 2014, said Ambrosius Klangit, the field coordinator of Sunday’s protest,.</p>
      <p>Papuans and the victims’ families have since waited for Jokowi to fulfill his promise, he added.</p>
      <p>Klangit expressed concerns that instead of upholding his commitment to resolving the case, Jokowi’s administration seemed to be responsible for more human rights violations over the past five years.</p>
      <p>“If [the government] has exploited natural sources [in Papua], they should respect Papuans’ rights to ownership and life,” Klangit said.</p>
      <p>The Paniai shooting is among the cases of human rights violations in Papua — including the 2001 Wasior and 2003 Wamena case — that Jokowi has vowed to settle since his first term in office.</p>
      <p>Activists and the victims’ families, however, have repeatedly criticized the government for making what they see as sluggish efforts to take action.</p>
      <p>Papuan human rights lawyer Yohanes Mambrasar argued that the government actually had the tools to resolve the Paniai case, citing a 2000 law that stipulates that rights abuse cases committed after the year 2000 should be resolved through the human rights court.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, there is no reason not to settle [the case],” he told reporters on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Yohanes said settling the Paniai case could be a barometer of Jokowi’s willingness to resolve other human rights violations in Papua.</p>
      <p>“When one talks about the development of Papua, one also talks about the settlement of rights abuse cases,” he said, “If [Jokowi] cannot solve the cases, Papuans can also measure Jokowi’s capability to develop Papua.”</p>
      <p>Although five years have passed since the incident, Papuans are still pinning their hope on new Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Mahfud MD — a well-known legal expert — to help them.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people are depending on [Mahfud],” Yohanes said. (sau)</p>
