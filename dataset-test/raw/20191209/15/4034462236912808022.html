      <h1>Chevrolet Camaro Discounts Are Even Better This Month</h1>
      <h2>Any Mustang owners willing to switch sides?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:20:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Despite being a fantastic muscle car, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro">Chevrolet Camaro</a> still lags behind its chief rival, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang">Ford Mustang</a>, in sales. While the Mustang is available overseas in right-hand-drive configuration, the Camaro is not. Even on the domestic front, the Mustang outpaces Camaro sales. Last year, for example, a total of 75,842 Mustangs were sold in the US, compared to 50,963 Camaros. Expect a similar result for 2019. Instead of accepting defeat outright, Chevrolet continues to stay in the fight by offering attractive Camaro sales incentives.</p>
      <p>Last month, Chevy was selling the V8-powered Camaro SS Coupe at <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chevrolets-brilliant-strategy-to-convince-people-to-buy-camaro-v8s">12 percent below MSRP</a>. And last summer the Bow Tie brand had an even <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chevrolet-makes-an-unusual-offer-to-ford-mustang-owners">more interesting offer</a>: a $2,500 discount on 2019 Camaros for current Mustang owners and lessees. Could they coax some Mustang drivers to switch sides?</p>

      <p>Whatever ultimately happened, Chevy has decided to bring back this offer, only better. As part of the brand's December sales program, not only is it offering Chevy employee pricing but also another $2,500 total cash allowance for a grand total of $5,495 off MSRP for a 2019 Camaro SS.</p>
      <p>But again, the main stipulation is that buyers must be current Mustang owners or lessees. It's an interesting offer, no doubt, but if you're only seeking to get the best V8 power bang for your buck without any brand loyalty, then it probably doesn't get any better than this. The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro SS has an MSRP of $37,000. Do the quick math and this discount drops the price to a darn reasonable $31,505.</p>

      <p>That gets you a 45- hp 6.2-liter V8, rear-wheel-drive muscle car. To further compare, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang-gt">Ford Mustang GT</a> has a 5.0-liter V8 with 460 hp and an MSRP of $35,630, though that's without any incentives. As of this writing, Ford does not appear to be offering any Mustang discounts this month, but it's always best to check at dealerships because some offers are unadvertised.</p>
