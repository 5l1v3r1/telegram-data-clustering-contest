      <h1>Irish pig prices remain stagnant at below €2/kg mark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:13:20+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author">Breifne O'Brien</a></address>
      <p>It has been outlined that there has been no rise given in quotes from Irish pig factories for a fourth week in succession and there is “complete justification for the Irish pig price to increase”.</p>
      <p>According to a statement from the Irish Farmers’ Association’s (IFA’s) pigs committee, quotes remain “at €1.96c/kg predominately”.</p>
      <p>However, the statement further outlined: “Some farmers are receiving less with a price 2c/kg lower in the south of the country while a pig processor in Cookstown, Co. Tyrone, is paying in excess of €2/kg to some Irish suppliers.”</p>
      <p>Commenting on the situation, the IFA’s pigs chairman, Tom Hogan, said: “It is disappointing that the Irish pig price has not kept pace with EU prices which have seen significant increases in the past three weeks.</p>
      <blockquote>All processors are very anxious to secure enough pigs for the new year in anticipation of the continued demand from China.</blockquote>
      <p>Continuing, the IFA pigs chairman said: “The German and Danish prices have officially broken across the €2/kg mark and this is reportedly on the back of the unprecedented demand from Asian buyers – the same market that Ireland is now exporting directly into.”</p>
      <p>Concluding, Hogan said: “There is complete justification for the Irish price to increase by 4c/kg and every pig should be paid a €2/kg minimum.”</p>
