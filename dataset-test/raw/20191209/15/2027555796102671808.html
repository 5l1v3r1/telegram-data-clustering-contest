      <h1>Impatient Trump might change Kim's views: N.Korea envoy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:16:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may change his views toward U.S. President Donald Trump if he continues making "inappropriate, dangerous" comments, a senior Pyongyang official said on Monday, calling him an "impatient, old man."</p>
      <p>Kim Yong Chol, a senior North Korean official who was instrumental in arranging a failed second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, said the United States was ignoring a year-end deadline set for Washington to soften its stance in stalled denuclearisation talks.</p>
      <p>"We have nothing more to lose," he said in a statement carried by state news KCNA.</p>
      <p>Trump said on Sunday Kim risks losing "everything" if he resumes hostility and his country must denuclearise after the North said it had carried out a "successful test of great significance."</p>
