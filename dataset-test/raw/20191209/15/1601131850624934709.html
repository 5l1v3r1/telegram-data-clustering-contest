      <h1>No Android 10/One UI 2.0 beta program coming for the Galaxy Fold</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:46:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>In the least surprising news of the day, Samsung has <a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8/%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B810-10-%EC%A0%95%EC%8B%9D-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%86%8C%EC%8B%9D/td-p/2991875">confirmed</a> that there will be no One UI 2.0 beta program for the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-fold/">Galaxy Fold</a>, its company’s costliest mobile device in the market right now. The confirmation comes via the company’s community forums in Korea, where it was also revealed that the Galaxy Note 10’s stable Android 10 update will come out “soon”, with no other specifics given.</p>
      <p>Galaxy Fold not getting access to an Android 10 beta to test out the new version of the OS is in line with how Samsung has treated its foldable device <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/opinions/2100-euros-dont-expect-samsung-care-much-about-galaxy-fold/">as far as software updates are concerned</a>, especially the 5G-enabled variant. The Fold has <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-fold-gets-galaxy-note-10-camera-features-in-new-update/">constantly been playing catch-up</a> in both security and feature updates compared to the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy S10. Even the Android 10 update for the Fold has been scheduled for April, a full three months after the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 if we go by <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-india-galaxy-s9-note-9-s10-note-10-m20-and-m30-get-android-10-in-january/">Samsung’s official roadmap</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, the considerably lower sales figures and limited availability of the Galaxy Fold probably have to do with Samsung’s decision to not start a beta program for it, despite how high the foldable phone’s price may be. It’s also unclear just how many Fold owners would be willing to install beta software on it, and we can only hope Samsung will at least <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/opinions/why-the-galaxy-fold-often-feels-like-a-missed-opportunity">introduce some functionality that takes advantage of the foldable form factor</a> with the Fold’s Android 10 update in return for making us wait so long for the update to come out.</p>
