      <h1>Mark Timlin the third player to re-sign with Finn Harps for 2020</h1>

        <b>Finn Harps have confirmed that Mark Timlin has re-signed with the club ahead of the 2020 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The midfielder has been at the Ballybofey club since joining on loan in 2017 from northern rivals Derry City.</p>
      <p>The Buncrana native featured fifteen times for the Harps last season, making just ten starts and five substitute appearances.</p>
      <p>However, his time on the pitch last season was curtailed due to injuries and Timlin is hoping that he can have a bit more luck on that front next year.</p>
      <p>"Last season was a tough year for me personally having to sit the majority of the season out injured, but overall I was delighted to be able to contribute towards the end and help the club stay in the Premier Division," Timlin told <a href="https://www.finnharps.ie/">finnharps.ie</a>.</p>
      <p>"Fingers crossed I can stay injury free this year and help the club push on."</p>
      <p>The news of Timlin's re-signing comes less than a week after Ollie Horgan signed a new two-year deal to remain on as manager with the club.</p>
      <p>Horgan echoed Timlin’s hopes for greater fortune in 2020.</p>
      <p>"Mark had an awful time with injuries last season but in fairness to him, he worked at it and did all he could to get back on the pitch and help the lads.</p>
      <p>"He’s probably one of our more creative players so with a bit of luck he can keep fit and give us a big boost going forward."</p>
      <p>Gareth Harkin was the first player Horgan signed ahead of the new season and he will be counting on the midfielder's experience.</p>
      <p>"We’re delighted to have Gareth back with us for next year," said Horgan. "He’s been a big part of the squad in our time in the Premier over the past few years and knows what it takes at this level."</p>
      <p>The club's 2019 Player of the Season, Mark McGinley - who kept an impressive 9 clean sheets in 19 starts - has also signed up for the coming season.</p>
