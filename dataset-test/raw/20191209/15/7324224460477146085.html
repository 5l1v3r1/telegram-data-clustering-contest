      <p>The homeowners heard flapping noises during the night coming from the chimney breast in the living room and when they went to investigate they could just see a bird’s talons holding onto a ledge above the fireplace.</p>
      <p>They alerted the RSPCA and animal collection officer Catherine Strawford was sent to the property, off Holly Lane in Great Wyrley, near Walsall.</p>
      <p>She managed to free the bird of prey by dismantling part of the fireplace. The owl escaped and took flight for a few seconds in the room until Catherine was able to safely capture him.</p>
      <p>She said: “As soon as he flew from the fireplace I was relieved because I knew that meant his wings were not damaged.</p>
      <p>“I managed to safely get hold of him but he was quite feisty.</p>
      <p>“He looked in good bodily condition but was covered in soot so I took him to the RSPCA’s Stapeley Grange Wildlife Centre, in Cheshire, where he was cleaned and checked over.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully, he was in good health so I was able to take him back to the nearby location and released him back into the wild at dusk that night. It is always amazing to see a job through like this with a happy ending.</p>
      <p>"The owl is believed to have got down the chimney as it was not capped off and birds are often able to fit through small openings, so the RSPCA advises fitting a wire mesh guard or cowl to the top of the chimney to prevent birds from becoming trapped."</p>
