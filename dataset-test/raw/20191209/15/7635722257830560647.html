        <b>Chelsea manager Frank Lampard's been handed a boost ahead of their Champions League meeting with Lille with a return to fitness for Antonio Rudiger.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The German defender has managed just 45-minutes under Frank Lampard this season - away to Wolves on September 14 - before succumbing to a groin injury.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/12/09/blues-train-ahead-of-lille-but-duo-miss-out">Fikayo Tomori and Olivier Giroud</a> will both miss the make-or-break Group H clash at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Chelsea will go into the game third in the group, and needing a win if they're to make the last-16.</p>
      <p>The Blues have lost three of their last five games, last keeping a clean sheet on November 9, so Rudiger's return is a timely one for Lampard, "He’s been training really well. He’s got a lot of his fitness work done, his injury has healed.</p>
      <p>"It will potentially be difficult for him [after a long time out], but our guard against that was to give him a lot of work.</p>
      <p>"We have managed to create some things behind the scenes here in training that look like matchplay, and some pure running as well. He has come through all that.</p>
      <p>"You can only speak as you look at him, and he looks fit and ready to go, and I know he’s hungry.</p>
      <p>"In terms of building him up, rightly so, he’s a good defender.</p>
      <p>"People maybe overlook the fact we started the season with five big players all injured for a period of time.</p>
      <p>"You do miss those individuals, so let’s see what he can add to us."</p>
      <p>England defender Tomori misses the game due to what Lampard describes as "a tiny strain around his hip area".</p>

      <p>Chelsea began Group H with a 1-0 defeat at home to Valencia, and have drawn each of their last two games in the group.</p>
      <p>Despite their stuttering European form, Lampard is happy his young squad still have the opportunity to progress within their grasp, "There are expectations we that would get through the group, I get that, but it was a tough group.</p>
      <p>"The slightly young feel to our team, the fact we lost the first game, the few difficulties we have had, I think we have dealt with them very well to get into this position.</p>
      <p>"There is still work to be done so we have to go out to win the game."</p>
