      <h1>20-storey Bolton tower block branded a 'blot' on the landscape</h1>
      <h2>It would bring 144 new apartments to the town centre</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:36:17+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Timan, Local Democracy Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Guardians defending <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bolton">Bolton’s heritage</a> have criticised plans to transform a key gateway site as a “blot” on the landscape.</p>
      <p>In a formal objection to the council, the heritage group has said the “overbearing” 20-storey tower at the centre of the Trinity Gateway project would compete for prominence with “much-loved” local landmarks like the town hall and parish church.</p>
      <p>Bolton and District Civic Trust described the multi-million-pound scheme as a “desert of hard paving” which gives out the wrong message at a time of a climate emergency.</p>
      <p>The group also fear that the 144 apartments would act as an “overflow development” for young office workers commuting to Manchester.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “In the recent past, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bolton-council">Bolton Council</a> has turned its back on high-rise development, it being deemed to be unpopular with residents, difficult to maintain and unsightly in an essentially low-rise environment.</p>
      <p>“Suddenly, in an attempt to ‘capture’ some of the high-rise living ‘boom’ that is sweeping across central Manchester, it is deemed to be acceptable, even desirable, to once more encourage high-rise living in the town.</p>
      <p>“There is no evidence for believing that this is appropriate for the habitation needs in the context of sustainable town centre regeneration.”</p>
      <p>Beechlane Investments submitted plans for the Trinity Gateway project, which includes 30,000 sq ft of office space, a 505-space multi-storey car park and public open space, together with a proposal to turn the former Magistrates’ Court in Le Mans Crescent into a hotel.</p>
      <p>The development, which would be located on the corner of Bradshawgate and Trinity Street, is intended to kickstart the regeneration of this part of the town centre which is one of the five “intervention areas” in the council’s £1.5bn masterplan.</p>
      <p>The heritage group also objected to the lower and upper ground floors in Le Mans Crescent being part of the proposed hotel, urging it to be retained by the council for potential expansion of the library and museum instead.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman: “Consultation is underway on the planning applications which have been submitted for both Le Mans and Trinity Gateway.</p>
      <p>“We welcome comments on the developer’s proposals, and feedback received on planning matters will form part of the report which is considered by planning committee.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the developer said: “The Trinity Gateway project application marks an important step in the regeneration of Bolton town centre.</p>
      <p>“We read with interest all of the comments from consultees and aim to deliver a project which will kick start positive change in this part of the town.”</p>
      <p>Councillors on the planning committee are due to make a final decision on the proposal in the new year on the advice of town hall planners.</p>
