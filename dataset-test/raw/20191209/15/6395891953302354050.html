      <p>Walmart Canada apologized after several adult-themed sweaters were posted for sale on its website, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/business/walmart-apology-santa-sweater/index.html">CNN</a> reported. According to <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6267927/walmart-canada-christmas-sweaters-cocaine/">Global News</a>, a Canadian news organization, one of the sweaters included Santa Claus and a drug reference.</p>
      <p>One sweater depicts a wide-eyed Santa Claus and three lines of a white, powdery substances that are implied to be cocaine, the website reported. The shirt had the slogan "Let it snow" emblazoned on its front.</p>
      <p>"We all know how snow works. It's white, powdery and the best snow comes straight from South America," <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6267927/walmart-canada-christmas-sweaters-cocaine/">Global News</a> reported, citing the product's description on Walmart's website. "That's bad news for jolly old St. Nick, who lives far away in the North Pole."</p>
      <p>"These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on <a href="http://walmart.ca/">Walmart.ca</a>, do not represent Walmart's values and have no place on our website. We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologize for any unintended offense this may have caused," a spokesman told <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6267927/walmart-canada-christmas-sweaters-cocaine/">Global News</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The sweater appeared to have been removed from Walmart's website Sunday night, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/business/walmart-apology-santa-sweater/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The sweater was made by clothing company <a href="https://www.fun.com/ugly-christmas-sweaters.html">FUN Wear</a>.</p>
      <p>Several shoppers commented about the product on social media:</p>
