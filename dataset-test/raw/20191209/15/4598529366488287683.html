      <p>Tough love, indeed.</p>
      <p>Singer Linda Ronstadt didn’t hesitate to rip into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a State Department reception at the 42nd Annual Kennedy Center Honors in Washington on Saturday night, according to a <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/linda-ronstadt-mike-pompeo-trump-kennedy-center-honors-1203428866/">Variety report</a> Sunday.</p>
      <p>During his first turn as the official host of the event, where honorees receive their Kennedy Center rainbow ribbons, Pompeo wondered aloud: “As I travel the world, I wonder when I will be loved,” referring to lyrics in Ronstadt’s 1975 hit “When Will I Be Loved,” according to Variety.</p>
      <p>When Ronstadt, who is known as an ardent critic of President Trump, took the microphone to receive the honor, she took aim at Pompeo.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to say to Mr. Pompeo, who wonders when he’ll be loved, it’s when he stops enabling Donald Trump,” Ronstadt said, according to Variety.</p>
      <p>Variety reported that Ronstadt immediately sat down after her remark, which drew gasps, slow-building applause and cheers from the audience.</p>
      <p>Last month, Pompeo signaled that that he would be <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/pompeo-gives-trump-cover-on-his-bogus-ukraine-conspiracy-theory-floats-potential-probe">open to investigating</a> Trump’s debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 elections.</p>
