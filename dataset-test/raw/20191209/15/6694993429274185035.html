      <h1>Dalian Atkinson death: Two police officers appear in court and will stand trial</h1>
      <h2>Benjamin Monk is accused of the murder of the former Manchester City star and Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith denies assault</h2>

      <p>A police officer accused of murdering former Manchester City star Dalian Atkinson will stand trial in September next year alongside a colleague who denies assaulting the ex-footballer.</p>
      <p>PC Benjamin Monk, 41, was not required to enter pleas to a count of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter during a pre-trial hearing at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>The West Mercia Police constable's colleague, Pc Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, 29, entered a not guilty plea to a charge alleging that she assaulted Mr Atkinson occasioning actual bodily harm prior to his death on August 15 2016.</p>
      <p>Mr Atkinson, 48, who also played for Aston Villa, Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday, died after police used a Taser during an incident near his father's house in the Trench area of Telford, Shropshire.</p>
      <p>Both officers were charged last month after a three-year inquiry into the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/family-former-manchester-city-player-13477242">death of Mr Atkinson</a>, who went into cardiac arrest in an ambulance on his way to hospital.</p>

      <p>Judge Melbourne Inman QC granted both officers unconditional bail until a further hearing in May next year, and fixed a trial date for September 14 at Birmingham Crown Court.</p>
      <p>The judge also rejected the defence's application for the trial to be held outside of Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Asking for the trial to be moved to another location, Paul Gibbs, defending Monk, said: "There is an unusual element of personality in this case.</p>

      <p>"Mr Atkinson was a well-loved character and an admired figure in the area.</p>
      <p>"He is connected to totemic events such as cup finals."</p>
      <p>The officers were anonymous until November 13, when a judge removed reporting restrictions banning publication of their identities.</p>
      <p>Atkinson was pronounced dead at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford.</p>
      <p>He also played for Sheffield Wednesday, Ipswich Town, Fenerbache and Real Sociedad during a career spanning 16 years.</p>
      <p>He scored in Villa's 3-1 1994 League Cup final victory over Manchester United and went onto net 36 times for the club in 114 appearances.</p>
      <p>His solo wonder goal against Wimbledon in October 1992 also won him Match of the Day's goal of the season award in the inaugural Premier League season.</p>
