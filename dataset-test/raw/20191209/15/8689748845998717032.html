      <p>According to James Gardiner, even though the essence of “The Year Of Return” initiative has not been properly explained to Ghanaians, it is important for us to stop dwelling on past mistakes and start thinking of the way forward.</p>
      <p>James Gardiner further explained that, most of the foreigners coming for the year of return are only coming to have fun and organize parties and instead of fixating on the brouhaha with Cardi B, we should rather focus on making sure those coming down to Ghana have an amazing experience.</p>
      <p>Taking to his Instagram page, James Gardiner wrote;<br/>“Even though I feel not a lot has been done with regards to educating people about the ” year of return “, I would like to plead that we stop dwelling on past events and focus more on how to sell Ghana well. I feel like everyone is just coming to down to party…which is not a bad thing at all. It’s just that we have a lot more to offer. But if loads of people are coming down only to party for the ” year of return”, that’s still a very good start! At least people outside will know Ghana is a fun place to be! Let’s dwell on these things instead! Medaase”.</p>
      <p>James Gardiner was recently accused of being a womanizer by budding actress, Edwina Mensah who has a crush on him.<br/>Checkout his post below;</p>
