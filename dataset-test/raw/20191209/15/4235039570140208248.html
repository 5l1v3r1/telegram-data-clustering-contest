      <p>Photographer Liz Carlson has shot coloured <b>glaciers</b> at Mount Aspiring National Park on <b>New Zealand</b>'s South Island, Science Alert reported.</p>
      <p>“Our <b>glaciers</b> don’t need any more battles as they are already truly endangered,” Carlson wrote on her blog. “It puts the impact of climate change into even more stark reality we can’t ignore.”</p>
      <p>For now, it is unknown what caused the <b>red</b> colour of the glaciers. According to meteorologist Chris Brandolino, it could be soot or a carbon material from burnt wood. However, it could also just be <b>red</b> dust blown over from Australia, a phenomenon that's been observed before. Australian topsoil is rich in iron oxides, giving it its characteristic <b>red</b> hue. </p>
      <p>In addition to the catastrophic fires on Australia's east coast, has also seen strong dust storms. Last month in Mildura, Victoria, a storm turned the sky <b>red</b> and the temperatures reached 40 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>Whether the <b>red</b> cover of the pristine <b>New Zealand</b> mountains is dust, soot or anything else, Brandolino explained that several factors need to be combined to allow it to cross the Tasmanian Sea.</p>
      <p>"You need to have smoke or dust in the air to begin with, and you have to have the right wind direction, and I think, having two happening at the same time, that's what's led [to this]”, he said.</p>
      <p>"The fact that Australia had ... numerous fires out there, I think that's certainly been a part of it."</p>
      <p>The photos also show how interconnected the ecosystems of our planet are. Pollution can even reach the most remote places.</p>
