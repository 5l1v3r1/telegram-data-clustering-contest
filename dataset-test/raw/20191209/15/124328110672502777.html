      <p>A grandmother has been jailed over a £30,000 blackmail plot against a married man she had a brief 'sexual encounter' with.</p>
      <p>Lorraine Cox, 60, warned her victim he would be attacked or killed unless he made regular cash payments in a cruel scam that lasted two years after their secret liaison in 2016.</p>
      <p>In a statement made shortly after his ordeal, the married grandfather, who is in his 60s, said: 'I have lost my family, my marriage and all my savings due to one stupid mistake.</p>
      <p>'I hate myself for it. At one point I felt suicidal. I want the whole thing to go away.'</p>
      <p>Cox, of Linden, Gateshead, denied blackmail but was found guilty by a jury after a trial. Judge Stephen Earl sentenced her to two and a half years behind bars. </p>
      <p>Prosecutor Graham O'Sullivan told Newcastle Crown Court the victim had told Cox about his fantasy to have a threesome and she said she would arrange it, with one of her female friends.</p>
      <p>But the court heard when the man 'backed out' of the threesome, Cox commenced her blackmail campaign.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Sullivan said: 'He started receiving text messages in which she told him the boyfriend of her friend had found out about the arrangement and he was now demanding he pay money and unless he did so he would kill him.</p>
      <p>'Ill advisedly, instead of going straight to the police, the complainant gave the defendant £1,000 to give to the supposed angry husband.'</p>
      <p>The court heard the victim continued to hand over cash during regular meetings with Cox, who usually asked for £1,000 at a time.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Sullivan added: 'Sometimes he was simply unable to pay the full amount and would end up paying her whatever he could afford at the time.</p>
      <p>'Over the period of the blackmail, at least two years, the Crown would say he handed over a substantial amount of money.'</p>
      <p>The court heard the victim initially thought he had handed over around £10,000 but a through investigation through his bank statements showed it was closer to £30,000.</p>
      <p>Cox was arrested after a member of the victim's family overheard a phone call of him telling her he could not afford to pay her and his wife found out.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Sullivan said: 'He then, and only then, told her everything that had happened and understandably that put a great strain on the marriage. He described it having ended.'</p>

      <p>The court heard Cox continued her demands even after she knew her victim's family had found out and sent him 150 text messages between July and August last year.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Sullivan added: 'One of the aspects of the blackmail which became evident was that the defendant appeared to present herself as also being blackmailed by the angry partner of her friend, presenting herself as the victim as well.</p>
      <p>'In reality, she was nothing of the kind.</p>
      <p>'In interview with the police, the defendant was to admit there had been no angry husband or partner making threats, she had made this all up.' </p>
      <p>The judge told her: 'There was threats of violence that actually worked, that's what got the money paid.</p>
      <p>'It was long term nature threats of violence imposed upon him to obtain various sums of cash, well in excess, clearly, of what he could realistically afford.</p>
      <p>'You didn't just threaten for revenge, this was an extraction of money and you did receive considerable sums of money from him for your own benefit.</p>
      <p>'You caused enormous distress over a lengthy period of time, not only to him but to his wider family.'</p>
      <p>The court heard it is unclear whether the victim's marriage completely ended but it is understood he does still have support from his family.</p>
      <p>Annelise Haugstad, defending, said the £30,000 sum is an estimation and not an accurate calculation of the money received.</p>
      <p>Miss Haugstad said Cox, who has never been in trouble before, is a mother and grandmother who is carer for her long term partner of 43 years who has significant health problems.</p>
      <p>Miss Haugstad said Cox's absence would have a huge impact on the wider family.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have launched proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover an assets Cox has.</p>
