      <p>Penny Lancaster stunned husband, Sir Rod Stweart, on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> today (9.12.19).</p>
      <p>Penny, 48, left Rod unimpressed when she got his age wrong.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she mixed him up with her DAD when she googled him.</p>

      <p>Rod was describing how thankful he was for all the people who come out and still see him perform.</p>
      <aside>I'm sitting there thinking you know, I'm 74.</aside>
      <p>"I'm sitting there thinking you know, I'm 74," he said.</p>
      <p>But Penny interrupted as the audience laughed: "Darling, you're 75... you're 76 in January."</p>
      <p>"No I'm not, shut up... no I'm not, I'm 74 now," he responded.</p>

      <p>Penny then realised she'd actually got her husband mixed up with her dad, who is a year older than him.</p>
      <p>"Oh maybe I'm talking about my dad, cos he's one year older!" she said, leaving the audience in hysterics.</p>
      <p>She quickly googled her husband to confirm his age.</p>
      <p>"Sorry, my mistake, we all make mistakes darling, sorry," she said red-faced when she realised she had made the faux pas.</p>

      <p>The last time Penny appeared on the show, she broke down in tears talking about her <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/penny-lancaster-cries-as-she-gives-update-on-sir-rod-stewarts-cancer-battle/">husband's prostate cancer battle</a>.</p>
      <p>She revealed that he was diagnosed with the potentially-fatal illness two-and-half years ago and doctors discovered that the tumour had moved outside his prostate gland and so removing it wouldn't cure him.</p>
      <p>But he was given the all-clear after a three-month 'intensive treatment program', she said.</p>
