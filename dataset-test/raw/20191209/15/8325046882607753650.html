      <p>Malaysia has reported its first polio case nearly three decades after the last occurence in 1992.</p>
      <p>Last Friday (Dec 6), The Star reported the country’s Health Ministry confirming that a <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/12/08/polio-case-reported-in-malaysia--first-in-27-years">three-month-old boy</a> from Tuaran, Sabah, has been infected with vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) after being admitted into a hospital’s intensive care unit.</p>
      <p>The Star quoted health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah who said on Sunday (Dec 8): “The patient is currently undergoing treatment in an isolation ward and is in stable condition but needs respiratory support.”</p>
      <p>He added that the poliovirus is classified as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1), which originates from a poliovirus that has been weakened by the orally-administered polio vaccine.</p>
      <p>The Star reported that Dr Hisham said the weakened virus excretes from the body through faeces.</p>
      <p>However, in unsanitary environments, the virus can infect others who have not been immunised against polio and will “thus spread in communities whose polio immunisation rates are less than 95 per cent”.</p>
      <p>He warned that if the disease is left uncontrolled, it can genetically mutate until it once again becomes an active virus.</p>
      <p>The New Straits Times reported that the Health Ministry <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/12/546040/polio-makes-comeback-27-years-after-eradication">will continue vaccination exercises</a> in the area where this case was found, as well as other risk areas, to ensure that immunisation is above the rate of 95 per cent.</p>
      <p>NST stated that Malaysia’s last polio case was in 1992, before the country was declared polio-free in 2000.</p>
      <p>Here are three things you should know about the incurable disease:</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1) Polio mainly affects young children</h3>
      <h3>Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a contagious disease mainly affects young children, and lives in an infected person’s throat and intestines.</h3>
      <h3>It can invade an infected person’s brain and spinal cord, causing paralysis in serious cases – which can lead to permanent disability or death.</h3>
      <h3>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – an American public health institute – states that the virus<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.htm"> enters the body through the mouth</a> and spreads through contact with the faeces of an infected person.</h3>
      <h3>Though less common, it can also spread through droplets from a sneeze or cough.</h3>

      <h3> 2) Symptoms range from flu-like to paresthesia and paralysis.</h3>
      <h3>The institute noted that about one in four people with poliovirus infection will have flu-like symptoms, including: Sore throat; fever; fatigue; nausea; headache; and stomach pain.</h3>
      <h3>CDC said these symptoms usually last two to five days, and “then go away on their own”.</h3>
      <h3>A smaller proportion of people will develop more serious symptoms, like paresthesia (feeling pins and needles in the legs), meningitis (infection of the covering of the spinal cord and/or brain), and paralysis.</h3>
      <h3>However, meningitis only occurs in about one in 25 people with polio, while paralysis occurs in about one out of 200 people.</h3>

      <h3>3) Vaccination is the most effective way of prevention</h3>
      <h3>Although incurable, the disease can be prevented.</h3>
      <h3>Polio vaccines, given multiple times, <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis">can protect a child for life</a>, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.</h3>
      <h3>A 2019 article by HealthHub – a web portal by Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) – says that <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/479/whatallparentsneedtoknowaboutpolio">two booster doses</a> should be given to all children, with the first at 18 months of age, and the second at 11 years of age.</h3>
      <h3>As for adults, CDC recommends a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/what-is-polio/travelers.html">series of three doses</a>, the first two separated by one to two months, and a third dose – six to twelve after the second.</h3>
