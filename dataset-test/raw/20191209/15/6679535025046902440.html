      <p>In an unusual turn of events, a snake crawled its way into the ACA cricket ground here on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy match between Andhra and Vidarbha.</p>
      <p>This delayed the start of the match by a few minutes. The domestic twitter handle of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, ‘@BCCIdomestic’ posted a video of the snake. In the video, the ground staff were seen directing the snake towards the exit, while the players seemed to remain clam throughout the situation.</p>
