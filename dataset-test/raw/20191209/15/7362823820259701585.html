      <p>Last year, a real estate agent from Dallas, Texas, traveled to Mexico for plastic surgery and died after her family claims a doctor injected anesthesia in the wrong place and caused her to have a heart attack, which resulted in fatal brain damage. Laura Avila’s family said she was healthy before she underwent a nose job and breast implant replacement surgery.</p>
