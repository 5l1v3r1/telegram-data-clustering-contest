      <h2>Forth Rivers Trust's Riverside Project is engaging with the local community to clean up the River Almond.</h2>

      <p>Volunteers pulled 33 shopping trolleys from the River Almond last week.</p>
      <p>Forth Rivers Trust organised the event as part of their Riverside Project and their volunteers teamed up with West Lothian Angling Association and removed 33 shopping trolleys, three bikes and two scooters from the water.</p>
      <p>They worked for over two hours on Friday, December 6, starting at Howden Weir viewing platform in Livingston.</p>
      <p>Scot Muir, who is a consultant with the Forth Rivers Trust, asked volunteers to bring decent footwear and to dress for the weather. They hauled Asda, Lidl, Marks and Spencer and Morrisons trolleys from the riverbed.</p>
      <p>Scot said: “There are issues in West Lothian, and in Scotland, where it seems to be a pastime for certain individuals to throw shopping trolleys in the river.</p>
      <p>“I believe all the rivers in Scotland suffer the same issue and trolleys are dangerous to fishermen and wildlife.</p>
      <p>“I really appreciated the guys who came along and removing the trolleys will improve the habitat and boost the river.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “The sight of them had been troubling me for a while so it was great to see the amount of interest from the public.”</p>
      <p>Forth Rivers Trust’s Riverlife: Almond and Avon Project looks to engage communities with all aspects of rivers and their wildlife through a range of activities and learning opportunities to promote the sustainable use of rivers and protect all wildlife which use rivers to thrive.</p>
      <p>The Trolley Removal Crew are operating on an ad hoc basis but the Riverlife team are always looking for volunteers to help their efforts on the River Almond.</p>
