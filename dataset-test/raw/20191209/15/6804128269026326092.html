      <h2>Arsenal news includes a look at how the club's loanees are getting on at their current clubs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:03:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>It's time to check in on those playing their football away from Arsenal this season.</p>
      <p>A busy summer of incomings at the Emirates Stadium resulted in the likes of Laurent Koscielny, Alex Iwobi and Carl Jenkinson leaving on permanent deals.</p>
      <p>While others left temporarily to get some first-team football under their belts this season.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at how Arsenal's loan contingent have all been getting on around the world.</p>
      <h3>Jordi Osei-Tutu</h3>
      <p>Life in Germany initially got off to a rotten start as the youngster was racially abused during a pre-season friendly back in July, reducing him to tears.</p>
      <p>"I am very disappointed about what happened," he told the official Arsenal website. "No one should ever be subject to any discrimination and it is really hard to understand how a fellow professional footballer could do this.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal and Bochum have provided great support to me and I hope that if nothing else, we can show that racism has no place within football."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But on the pitch things had started well for Osei-Tutu as he found the net for VfL Bochum in a 3-3 draw against Wehen Wiesbaden and was being used in a right-wing role at times.</p>
      <p>However, he then found first-team opportunities for the next month and returned as a late substitute in the German Cup loss against Bayern Munich at the end of October.</p>
      <p>Since then he's featured three times - taking his appearances to nine for the campaign - but was left on the bench in both of their last two games.</p>
      <h3>Ben Sheaf</h3>
      <p>Since sealing his move Doncaster Rovers, Sheaf has been getting plenty of game time.</p>
      <p>He was ever-present in the opening three games of the League One season, registering an assist in a 3-2 win over Fleetwood Town and has been used as a defensive midfielder by manager Darren Moore.</p>
      <p>Sheaf played 45 minutes of the 1-0 Carabao Cup first round loss against Grimsby Town, featured in the cup win over Lincoln City and has been getting regular 90 minute games.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Furthermore, he opened his account in the 7-1 win over Southend United in October.</p>
      <p>Found it tough going against Burton Albion last month as he was hauled off at half-time are making an error which resulted in a goal for the away side.</p>
      <p>Continues to be a regular for Doncaster, but suffered heartbreak in the FA Cup at the weekend as he played 90 minutes of the 3-0 defeat at the hands of Gillingham in the second round.</p>
      <p>He was subsequently left out of the midweek clash against Leicester City's Under-21s in the Football League Trophy, but returned for the draw against MK Dons on Saturday, in which he was substituted with 10 minutes remaining.</p>
      <h3>Dejan Iliev</h3>
      <p>With the season in Slovakia getting underway as early as July, Iliev is the Arsenal loanee with the most games under his belt so far.</p>
      <p>18 to be exact.</p>
      <p>Finally kept a clean sheet on his ninth appearance for SKF Sered and repeated the trick on his following two appearances, although he has conceded 26 in the process.</p>
      <p>Was beaten in the 88th minute as Sered fell to a 2-1 defeat against bottom side Pohronie that leaves them 10th of 12 in the table.</p>
      <h3>William Saliba</h3>
      <p>One of six signings this summer, but Saliba is spending the season on loan with the French outfit instead of being with the Gunners.</p>
      <p>However, his start to the season was delayed.</p>
      <p>In August, Saliba underwent surgery on an adductor muscle injury and missed up to six weeks of action. He also returned to London Colney in September to step up his rehabilitation and even attended the 2-2 draw against Watford at Vicarage Road.</p>

      <p>Made his first league appearance of the season as a late sub against Nimes, started the Europa League draw against Wolfsburg and helped Saint-Etienne keep a clean sheet against Lyon.</p>
      <p>Impressed Arsenal fans with his performance against Bordeaux and <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/arsenal-saint-etienne-william-saliba-17194315">caught the eye once again as Saint-Etienne beat AS Monaco 1-0</a> last month as he shut down Wissam Ben Yedder.</p>
      <p>He has unfortunately not featured since that Monaco game, after breaking a bone in his foot which has kept him sidelined.</p>
      <h3>Eddie Nketiah</h3>
      <p>It was a stunning start to the season for Arsenal's young attacker with Leeds United in the Championship.</p>
      <p>He scored on his first appearance for Marcelo Bielsa's side - a 3-0 win over Salford City in the Carabao Cup and followed that up with the winning goal on his league debut against Brentford.</p>
      <p>Nketiah also netted in Leeds' penalty shoot-out loss against Stoke City and helped himself to a hat-trick for the England u21's against Austria during the recent international break.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In total, Nketiah has five goals in 15 appearances across all competitions for Leeds, but even his late equaliser against Preston North End wasn't enough to earn him a start away at Sheffield Wednesday a few days later.</p>
      <p>The next task is to break into the Championship starting XI with all of his appearances so far coming off the bench.</p>
      <p>It looked like he was a certainty to start against Queens Park Rangers last month, <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/players/eddie-nketiah-injury-leeds-arsenal-17190279">only for injury to deny him that chance</a> .</p>
      <p>Nketiah made a return to action last week, grabbing 10 minutes off the bench against Middlesbrough with Leeds already four goals up.</p>
      <p>And during the week, another potential problem appeared with Arsenal drawn against Leeds in the FA Cup, leading to calls for the Gunners to recall the striker from his loan deal.</p>
      <p>And he was again restricted to the substitutes' bench this weekend in the clash against Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield. However, Nketiah came off the bench and played a part in the build up to Leeds' second goal in the 2-0 win.</p>
      <h3>Mohamed Elneny</h3>
      <p>On his first league appearance for his loan club the Egypt international failed to complete 90 minutes - and not because of an injury scare or being substituted.</p>
      <p>The midfielder saw red just 75 minutes into his debut for the Turkish side,as he lashed out after being elbowed by his opponent, who also saw red for his part in the incident.</p>
      <p>What a start!</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Has played in all five of Besiktas' Europa League games thus far which has yielded one victory.</p>
      <p>Is also a regular in the league team and featured in two wins in the past week, one in the Turkish Cup and another in the league that leaves Besiktas second in the table, three points behind Sivasspor.</p>
      <h3>Henrikh Mkhitaryan</h3>
      <p>Just like when he made his first Arsenal start, the Armenia international enjoyed a dream debut for AS Roma.</p>
      <p>On the scoresheet after 22 minutes to give the Serie A side a 3-0 lead over Sassuolo, he would play the entire 90 minutes as his loan club ran out 4-2 winners at the Stadio Olimpico.</p>

      <p>"He was already complaining of a discomfort to the adductor and with this density of matches it was clear he could feel some discomfort," Paulo Fonseca did.</p>
      <p>"As a preventive measure I had kept him out against Atalanta and he had recovered well. Then he got hurt against Lecce."</p>
      <p>He returned to action in a Europa League tie and scored on his Serie A comeback last weekend.</p>
      <p>This week he played 89 minutes of the 0-0 draw against Inter in his first start since his comeback from injury. Roma ended Inter's five-game winning streak in Serie A, but were on the back foot for much of the game with Mkhitaryan having to do plenty of tracking back to help his side.</p>
