      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:24:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Warren, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-new-office-in-nyc-2019-12">Amazon is opening a new office in New York City</a>, the company announced on Friday. The news comes less than a year after the company abandoned its plans for an NYC-based headquarters.</li>
        <li>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is worth an estimated $109 billion, according to both <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#59dc4b193d78">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index</a>.</li>
        <li>That makes Bezos roughly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/11/23/the-british-royal-family-is-worth-88-billion/">20% richer than the British monarchy.</a></li>
        <li>While <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/jeff-bezos">Bezos</a> is one of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-richest-person-net-worth-billions-2018-12">the richest people in the world,</a> his current ranking among the world’s billionaires is unclear.</li>
        <li>In November, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-overtakes-jeff-bezos-as-worlds-richest-person-bloomberg-2019-11">Bill Gates surpassed Bezos</a> to reclaim his spot as the world’s richest person after two years.</li>
        <li>But while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#59dc4b193d78">Forbes ranks Bezos as the world’s richest person</a> once again, Bloomberg’s calculations put Gates just ahead of him, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/">an estimated $110 billion net worth.</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-new-office-in-nyc-2019-12">Amazon is opening a new office in New York City’s Hudson Yards</a> neighborhood, the company announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>The company’s CEO, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos,</a> is one of the richest people on the planet. Worth <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/jeffrey-p-bezos/">an estimated $109 billion,</a> Bezos is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/11/23/the-british-royal-family-is-worth-88-billion/">20% richer than the British monarchy.</a></p>
      <p>The Amazon CEO has been the world’s richest person for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2018/10/03/how-jeff-bezos-became-the-richest-person-in-the-world-2018-forbes-400/">more than two years</a>, but that status has become unclear in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>In November, Microsoft cofounder <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-overtakes-jeff-bezos-as-worlds-richest-person-bloomberg-2019-11">Bill Gates surpassed Bezos</a> to reclaim his spot at the top of the billionaire rankings. Now, Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/william-h-gates/">pegs Gates’ wealth at $110 billion</a> – $1 billion more than Bezos. But <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#59dc4b193d78">Forbes ranks Bezos as the world’s richest person</a>, with Gates trailing by almost $3 billion.</p>
      <p>Bezos retained his ranking as the world’s richest person even following his divorce from MacKenzie Bezos in 2019. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mackenzie-bezos-amazon-stake-sales-2019-4">She kept a 4% stake in Amazon</a> worth roughly $35.7 billion, making her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mackenzie-bezos-amazon-career-wealthiest-richest-people-women-world-princeton-2019-4">the fourth-richest woman in the world</a>.</p>
      <p>Though Jeff Bezos’ <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/tech/jeff-bezos-pay/index.html">annual salary is only $81,840</a>, most of his wealth <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-amazon-stock-jeff-bezos-owns-after-divorce-2019-4-1028087921">comes from his Amazon shares</a>. The world’s richest man <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-makes-every-day-hour-minute-2018-10">makes $2,489 per second</a>, or more than twice what the median US worker makes in one week, according to Business Insider’s calculations last year.</p>
      <p>Here are 11 mind-blowing facts that show just how wealthy Bezos really is.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1. Bezos is worth $109 billion despite being paid an annual salary of just $81,840, less than what most US representatives take home.</h3>

      <p>Of course, a large portion of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-amazon-stock-jeff-bezos-owns-after-divorce-2019-4-1028087921">Bezos’ wealth is tied to Amazon stock</a>, not his salary.</p>
      <p>Business Insider last year calculated <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-makes-every-day-hour-minute-2018-10">how much Bezos <i>actually</i> makes in a year</a>, based on the change in his net worth year-over-year, and found it to be closer to $8.9 million.</p>
      <p>It’s even more impressive if you break that down to how much Bezos makes every day, every hour, and even every second.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>2. Bezos makes $2,489 per second — more than twice what the median US worker makes in one week.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>That’s $149,353 per minute.</p>
      <p>As Business Insider’s Hillary Hoffower previously reported, that means that in just one minute, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-makes-every-day-hour-minute-2018-10">the Amazon chief makes more than three times</a> what the median US worker makes in a year: about $47,000, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf">according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data</a>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>3. After divorcing MacKenzie Bezos and giving up 25% of the Amazon stock owned by the couple, Jeff Bezos kept his ranking as the richest person in the world.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>MacKenzie Bezos is now the fourth-richest woman in the world, after the L’Oreal heiress <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/all-about-franoise-bettencourt-meyer-heir-to-the-79-billion-loreal-fortune-2017-9">Francoise Bettencourt Meyers,</a> Walmart heiress <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-alice-walton-wealthiest-woman-spends-fortune-2017-9">Alice Walton,</a> and Mars candy company heiress <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/jacqueline-b-mars/">Jacqueline Mars.</a></p>
      <p>MacKenzie, who was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mackenzie-bezos-met-jeff-bezos-2019-1">one of Amazon’s first employees</a>, is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/mackenzie-bezos/">worth an estimated $35.2 billion</a>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>4. With his $109 billion, Bezos has a net worth equivalent to 23% of the top 100 US college endowments.</h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Which-Colleges-Have-the/245587">three richest colleges in the US</a> in 2018 based on the size of their endowments were Harvard University, with $38.3 billion, the University of Texas system, with $30.9 billion, and Yale University, with $29.4 billion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Bezos’ fortune is greater</a> than those three universities’ endowments combined – with more than $10 billion to spare.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>5. Bezos is so rich that an average American spending $1 is similar to Bezos spending $1.1 million.</h3>

      <hr/>
      <h3>6. The Amazon CEO is 20% richer than the British monarchy.</h3>

      <p>The British royal family was worth <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/11/23/the-british-royal-family-is-worth-88-billion/">an estimated $88 billion</a> in 2017, according to Forbes.</p>

      <h3>10. Even if a moderate wealth tax had been implemented almost 40 years ago, Bezos would still be the richest American, and the second-richest person in the world.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>At the end of 2018, Bezos was worth $160 billion.</p>
      <p>If the US had introduced a moderate wealth tax in 1982 – when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-americans-getting-richer-forbes-billionaires-list-jeff-bezos-2019-10">the first Forbes 400 data on American billionaires was published</a> – his net worth would now be about half that, or $86.8 billion, according to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Saez-Zucman_conference-draft.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;amp;stream=top#_ga=2.207975447.425031345.1568122231-1410129735.15679577595.1567957759">a recent study</a> published in Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.</p>
      <p>But even with a mere $86.8 billion fortune, Bezos would still be the richest American and the second-richest person in the world, outranked only by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernard-arnault-richest-person-in-europe-lvmh-life-photos-2019-1">French businessman Bernard Arnault</a>, who’s currently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/bernard-arnault/">worth $95.5 billion.</a></p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/wealth-tax">wealth tax</a> has been a hot topic among the Democratic presidential candidates in 2019, with both <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-warren-wealth-tax-drawing-support-from-2020-democrat-moderates-2019-10">Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren calling for increased taxes on the super-rich.</a></p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>11. Bezos has lost more money in 2019 than any other billionaire in the world, but he’s still the richest — or perhaps second-richest — of them all.</h3>
