      <p>Urabandai in the Fukushima Prefecture is a place that’s become very popular for nature sightseeing - and it’s at its best during autumn.</p>
      <p>Japanese families visit to show the spot to their children, while canoeing is available for the more adventurous.</p>

      <p>“The Bandai Mount you can see over there erupted 131 years ago, spilling out a great deal of earth and sand,” says guide Mutsuhiro Ikea. “The river was blocked and the lake formed. Then trees were replanted here and so nature has recovered.”</p>

      <p>Going deep into the forest, the Goshikinuma Walk, a four kilometre path, is famous for its ponds in different shades of blue.</p>
      <p>The relationship between the Japanese and nature is tight, almost spiritual - according to Hanitsu Jinja priest Shigetsugu Miyazawa.</p>
      <p>“The way Shinto thinks about nature is not to dominate it - but to live in symbiosis with it,” he explains. “This is how we think.”</p>
      <p>And when night falls, you have the impression you’re in a fairy tale.</p>
