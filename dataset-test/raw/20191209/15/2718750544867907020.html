      <p>This has been a very good year for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/6-stories-from-mel-brookss-q-and-a-in-london-last-night.html">Mel Brooks</a> fanatics looking to learn more about the comedy legend’s life and career. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/mel-brooks-biography-funny-man-book-highlights.html">exhaustive biography <i>Funny Man</i></a><i> </i>—<i> </i>which made <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/best-comedy-books-2019.html">Vulture’s list of the “10 Comedy Books of 2019”</a> — was released, and this week HBO will debut a documentary about Brooks that looks very promising. Titled <i>Mel Brooks: Unwrapped</i>,<i> </i>the documentary is a mix of new and old moments featuring Brooks and former creative director for the BBC Alan Yentob. It combines footage from Yentob’s 1981 documentary about Brooks, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2012/12/enjoy-the-1981-mel-brooks-bbc-doc-i-thought-i-was-taller.html"><i>I Thought I Was Taller</i></a><i> </i>(which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcenTHRTE5o">on YouTube</a>), with new footage in the form of “candid conversations and mock interviews.” “This doesn’t seem like a big production to me really,” Brooks says. “I mean, what the hell are you people spending on it? $28? I mean, you don’t even have a good ending!” If the trailer is any indication, it’s the perfect setup for what Brooks calls an “idiot documentary” about his fascinating life and beloved films: “All my films are serious. They’re not <i>dramatic </i>— that’s the difference.” <i>Mel Brooks: Unwrapped </i>airs on HBO this Friday at 9 p.m.</p>
