      <p>Red Bull Salzburg goalscoring sensation Erling Braut Haaland insists he is not distracted by speculation linking him to some of Europe’s top clubs.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has taken the Champions League by storm on his debut in the competition and his eight goals so far is bettered only by Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski.</p>
      <p>Haaland, son of former Leeds and Manchester City midfielder Alf-Inge, has scored 28 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions this term and has five hat-tricks to his name, including one on his Champions League debut.</p>

      <p>That has, understandably, led to him being linked with a number of clubs but the teenager is remaining focused on the job in hand: namely beating Liverpool on Tuesday to secure a place in the knockout stage at the defending champions’ expense.</p>
      <p>“I’m just focused on my job: playing football. I try to enjoy what I do every day, and go in with a clear mindset and enjoy the moment right now,” he told a press conference.</p>
      <p>“My focus now is on Salzburg and me as a player. It is not hard at all. I am enjoying every day playing football.</p>
      <p>“My father was a former player so he has been helping me but I also have a lot of friends who also help me in these situations.</p>
      <blockquote>This is the biggest game of my career so far. Matches like this are what you dream of so I am enjoying it. I'm living the dream.<cite>Erling Braut Haaland</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“Doing what I am doing every week it is not easy but that’s what I try to do. My father has been helping a lot.</p>
      <p>“This is the biggest game of my career so far. Matches like this are what you dream of so I am enjoying it. I’m living the dream.”</p>
      <p>Salzburg coach Jesse Marsch has praised the way the youngster has coped with the attention which has been thrust upon him.</p>
      <p>“This not a new theme, there has been a lot of talk. At one point we had a joke at a press conference that every day there was a new team interested,” Marsch said.</p>

      <p>“It is natural. Erling has had a great season and it is easy to see he is likeable and cares about the right things.</p>
      <p>“You don’t see him in the team every day like I do and that’s what makes him special, he cares so much about the team and team success.</p>
      <p>“Erling doesn’t have success without the whole group understanding how to play with each other and committing to each other.</p>
      <p>“In the end he has handled himself incredibly well given all the talk of potentially what will happen.</p>

      <p>“The biggest thing is he is living in the moment and he has done that well, as has the whole group.”</p>
