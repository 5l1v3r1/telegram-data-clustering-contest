          <h3>Revenue shortfalls in Nigeria</h3>
          <p>With this appointment, Nami will step into the shoes of Fowler, controlling a revenue agency that has witnessed<a href="https://www.pulse.ng/bi/finance/despite-hitting-its-highest-record-in-2018-the-firs-has-failed-to-meet-revenue/rdenxrh"> revenue shortfalls </a>for the country since the inception of the Buhari-led government in 2015.</p>
          <p>Four months ago, the government queried Fowler, over dwindling tax revenue and asked him to account for significant variances in the budgeted collections and actual collections by the agency. For this year, the agency projected N8 trillion collections for 2019.</p>
          <p>At different fora, the IMF and other international organisations have advised the government to increase its revenue sources to close a huge fiscal gap, rising debt level, and improve on infrastructural decay.</p>
