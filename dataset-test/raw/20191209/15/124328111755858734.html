      <p>The guide is going under the hammer at Hanson Auctioneers in Wolseley Bridge, Staffordshire, on December 12 and is expected to smash its estimate after a number of similar publications sold by Hansons Auctioneers proved to be a popular success.</p>
      <p>The salacious guide describes one woman as a 'frigate fit for a king', while another performs her part with admirable skill and dexterity'.  </p>
      <h4>Miss Alice Grey - The love-inspiring queen </h4>
      <p>One page of the guide describes a Miss Alice Grey, of Portland Road, Westminster, as 'frequently mounted a la militaire, and as frequently performs the rites of the love-inspiring queen according to the equestrian order, in which style she is said to afford uncommon delight.' </p>

      <h4>Miss Murray - A frigate fit for a king</h4>
      <p>The salacious book calls Miss Murray, of Foley Place, Oxford Street, 'a little frigate fit for a king to board.'</p>
      <h4>  </h4>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>Hansons Auctioneers books expert Jim Spencer said: 'Early erotic publications are extremely sought after with collectors both nationally and internationally.</p>
      <p>'Books like these were published and sold in secret at a time when they would have been regarded as obscene.</p>
      <p>'The fact that this latest find was disguised as a wallet speaks volumes about its content.'</p>

      <h4>Miss A Parks - 'She performs her part with admirable skill and dexterity'</h4>
      <p>The raunchy guide goes on to describe other prostitutes including Miss A Parks who is noted for her singing when she 'visits the side-boxes'.</p>
      <p>It says: 'In duets she employs her tongue and voice full as satisfactory as when it emits the shrillest note.</p>
      <p>'She performs her part with admirable skill and dexterity, and in such cases chooses the lowest part'  </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>There is a section entitled 'The Health of The Man of Pleasure' which includes prescriptions and descriptions of sexually transmitted diseases</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>However, the unknown author also offers a glimmer of romance among the debauchery, writing of Miss Parks:</p>
      <p>'Observe the rapture-giving squeeze</p>
      <p>The glowing cheek, the sparkling eye</p>
      <p>The falt'ring voice, the trembling knees</p>
      <p>That speak in silent words - I die'</p>
      <p>Another unnamed woman found at Jessops near Windmill Street is also recommended.</p>
      <p>It adds: 'Her conversation is pleasing, she drinks little, and swears seldom, so that, as time go, she is a very desirable companion.'</p>
      <h4>Miss Fowler - 'Makes the most of her leg' </h4>
      <p>Then there is Miss Fowler 'who when stepping into a cab or coach, she makes the most of her leg.'</p>
      <p>It continues: 'She generally sets fire to all the male passengers, so that you see them fidgeting and adjusting their rebellious members the remainder of the journey.'</p>

      <h3>Beware of clickman toads and fiery snorters: The language used by the ‘men of pleasure’ in saucy brothel guide</h3>
      <p>The Man of Pleasure's Illustrated Pocket-Book for 1850 uses slang terms as euphemisms for sexual activity, as well as many archaic words which are less commonly used.</p>
      <p>The below list helpfully defines them all: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hebe</b> - The name of the goddess of youth, who was daughter of Hera and Zeus and cup bearer to the gods. </li>
        <li><b>Ninion l'Enclos</b> - The name of a female 17th-Century author, whose name in France was synonymous with wit and beauty.   <b> </b></li>
        <li><b>Clickman Toad</b> - a nightwatchman</li>
        <li><b>Drawing a Wiper</b> - stealing a handkerchief</li>
        <li><b>Fiery Snorter </b>- a red nose</li>
        <li><b>Potato Trap </b>- a mouth </li>
        <li><b>A la militaire </b>- to the military </li>
        <li><b>Chide</b> - To scold or rebuke</li>
        <li><b>Quintessence </b>- the most perfect or typical example of a quality or class</li>
        <li><b>Genteel</b> - Polite, refined or respectable</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>The book also includes a Flash Dictionary, a guide to London criminal slang, with phrases such as Clickman Toad (a nightwatchman); Drawing a Wiper (stealing a handkerchief); Fiery Snorter (a red nose) and Potato Trap (a mouth). </p>
      <p>There is also a section entitled 'The Health of The Man of Pleasure' which includes prescriptions and descriptions of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
      <p>A page on 'gonorrhoea or clap' advises drinking a pint of water containing linseed and sugar or lemon and also advocates barley water or thin gruel to offset the symptoms..</p>
      <p>Mr Spencer uncovered a 300-year-old sex manual from 1720 which sold for £3,100 from an estimate of £80-£120.</p>
      <p>This was followed by Memoirs of the Life of Miss Fanny Hill, The Career of A Woman of Pleasure, from 1749, which sold for £360 from an estimate of £40-£60.</p>
      <p>Another auction success was Swell's Night Guide Through the Metropolis from 1841 which made £4,000 from its £800-£1,200 estimate.</p>
      <p>He also discovered six volumes of Justine by Marquis de Sade from 1791.</p>
      <p>Napoleon ordered the destruction of all copies and its rarity saw the price reach £8,000 from a guide of £2,000-£3,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Spencer added: 'I have a knack for unearthing centuries-old erotic literature, so much so my nickname at work is The Laird of Lewd.'</p>
