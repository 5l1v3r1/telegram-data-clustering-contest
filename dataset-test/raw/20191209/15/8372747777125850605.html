      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. â€” City leaders are discussing an $8 million-gun range for the Cape Coral Police Department.</p>
      <p>In June, council members approved to use police impact fee reserves for the training facility at the cost of $650,000.</p>
      <p>The Governor vetoed the funding request.</p>
      <p>The police department still wanted to move forward with the project.</p>
      <p>City council said they wanted to see more research before making any decisions.</p>
      <p>They are expected to vote on funding again tonight.</p>
      <p>The facility would be built on the corner of Andalusia and Durden Parkway.</p>
