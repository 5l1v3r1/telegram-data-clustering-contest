      <h3>What is Resident Evil 3 remake?</h3>
      <p>This is a full remake and reimagining of Capcom's Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, which released back in 1999. This game follows Jill Valentine, one of the protagonists of the original Resident Evil, as she attempts to escape Raccoon City, which is completely overrun with zombies. Along the way, an advanced creature known as the Nemesis begins stalking her throughout the city.</p>

      <p>Much like Resident Evil 2 (2019), Capcom is treating this remake as an entirely new entry, it's not a remaster. While it will be faithful to the story and characters, things may happen in different ways and enemy encounters or puzzles may play out differently.</p>
      <h3>What does Resident Evil 3 remake's gameplay look like?</h3>
      <p>Again like Resident Evil 2 (2019), the remake of Resident Evil 3 is a third-person survival-horror game. Players will have to manage scarce ammo and healing items as they struggle to survive.</p>
      <h3>Resident Evil 3 remake overview of features</h3>
      <p>Here's everything we know about the different features of the game, as well as some pre-release images. We have the different cover art for the game:</p>

      <h3>Will there be a demo for the Resident Evil 3 remake?</h3>
      <p>While we don't yet know if there will be a demo, Capcom has historically provided demos for their major upcoming games. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard had multiple demos, as did Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry V and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.</p>
      <h3>When is the release date for Resident Evil 3 remake?</h3>
      <p>We don't have a release date at the moment, though it's almost certainly going to be sometime in 2020. Capcom tends to favor January, March and September release date periods.</p>
