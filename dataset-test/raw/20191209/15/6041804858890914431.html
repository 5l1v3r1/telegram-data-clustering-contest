      <p>Andhra Pradesh Assembly Sessions began today this morning in Undavalli. The Principal Opposition Party, TDP has announced its intention of raking 13 issues in this session but the Ruling Party, YSR Congress seems to have some other ideas. The Ruling Party has no answers except for counter-attacking TDP with unrelated issues, the Opposition Party alleged.</p>
      <p>As the session convened, a person suffered a heart attack while standing in queue for onions at Gudivada Rythu Bazaar and passed away on the spot. “While the Opposition raked the issue, the Chief Minister, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy himself resorted to diverting the issue by mentioning about Onion Prices in Heritage Supermarkets,” TDP alleged.</p>
      <p>“Heritage is not the only place where the Onions are being sold at high prices. In fact, if the government controls the prices, automatically the prices in Heritage will also come down. Moreover, <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/chandrababu-naidu-insulting-himself-in-desperation/">Chandrababu</a> is not the sole proprietary of Heritage to decide the prices,” a former Minister of TDP alleged.</p>
      <p>While the house was discussing the crucial issue of Bifurcation Problems, the treasury benches raked the issue of Vote of Note Case and tried to show it as a reason for all problems. “The Government has nothing to say about what it did in this Six months to solve the issues,” TDP ridiculed.</p>
