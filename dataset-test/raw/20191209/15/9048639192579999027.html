      <p><b>WISNER, La. (KNOE) - </b>Authorities have identified the victim of a fatal fire in Franklin Parish.</p>
      <p>According to the state fire marshal's office, the victim was 72-year-old Ronald H. Bixler of Wisner.</p>
      <p>The fire happened in Wisner in the 400 block of Hope Street at 6:30 a.m. on Sunday, December 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>Bixler is disabled and was still inside his home when firefighters arrived. Firefighters went inside and found him on the living room floor next to his overturned walker. He was taken to the hospital where he later died.</p>
      <p>The case remains open and the fire is still under investigation.</p>
      <p>The fire marshal's office adds:</p>
      <p>
        <i>"SFM investigators believe the fire likely began in a bedroom, however, an exact cause remains undetermined. At this time, deputies are not ruling out the potential for electrical malfunction related to the homeâ€™s wiring and/or the use of a space heater.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Witness statements indicated the home did have working smoke alarms.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The SFM advises residents using space heaters to be sure to place the devices 3-5 feet away from combustibles and to always plug the devices directly into wall outlets as opposed to power strips and/or extension cords."</i>
