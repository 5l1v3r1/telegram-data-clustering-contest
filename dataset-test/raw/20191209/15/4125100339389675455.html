      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to depart Abuja Tuesday for Aswan, Egypt to attend the Aswan Forum designed to set “<i>An Agenda for Sustainable Peace and Development in Africa.”</i></p>
      <p>A statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina explained that the Forum which holds December 11-12, 2019, is an initiative to address the interconnections between peace and development in Africa while promoting Africa-led solutions through strengthening policies and practices.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, “The initiative is being launched by the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in his capacity as the Chairman of the African Union (AU) and as an advocate of Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development in Africa – a recurring theme of his tenure as the AU Chairman. It is also grounded in the AU’s <i>Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want</i>, and the search for African solutions to African problems.</p>
