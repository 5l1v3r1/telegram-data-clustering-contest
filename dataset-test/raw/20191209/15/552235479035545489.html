      <h1>Appeal launched to find missing Renton cat, Yoda</h1>
      <h2>The little hairless moggy went missing from the Dalquhurn area on Saturday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:55:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Lennox Herald, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lennox-herald/</a></address>
      <p>A worried pet owner has issued a plea over the disappearance of her rare cat.</p>
      <p>Rhonda Armstrong’s house cat Yoda vanished from her Renton home on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The moggy, a member of an exotic hairless breed, is particularly vulnerable to cold due to his almost complete lack of hair.</p>
      <p>Yoda, a pink Sphynx, disappeared from Rhonda’s home in the village’s Dalquhurn estate.</p>
      <p>The concerned pet owner took to Facebook to rally public support in the hunt for the vulnerable creature.</p>
      <p>Holistic therapist Rhonda said: “He’s an indoor cat but we can’t find him anywhere so can only assume he must have got outside.”</p>
      <p>She added: “My kids and I are all devastated. He’ll be terrified and cold.”</p>
      <p>Rhonda – who also has another cat – and her two children are worried about the missing animal’s welfare.</p>

      <p>Sphynx cats have markings on their hairless skin, similar to patterns found on their more usual cousins.</p>
      <p>They emerged as a breed in the 1960s and lose more body heat than run-of-the-mill moggies due to their lack of hair, causing them to look for heat sources.</p>
      <p>Yoda has fur only on his tail, feet and around the ears, as well as white markings on his face.</p>
      <p>Residents are being urged to keep an eye out for the unusual feline and check outbuildings or garden hedges.</p>
