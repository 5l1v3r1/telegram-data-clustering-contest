      <h1>The Wait Is Over: DOJ Inspector General Report On Alleged Obama-Era FISA Abuses Against Trump Team Drops Today</h1>

      <p>Well, the day has arrived. The long-awaited report from Michael Horowitz, the Department of Justice’s inspector general, on the alleged FISA abuses that occurred under the Obama administration will be released. We already have some tidbits that this report doesn’t corroborate the allegation that the Obama White House spied on the Trump campaign, but it will conclude that there were deviations from department policy concerning the process in obtaining these warrants. Okay, let’s play on that for a minute. That’s still not good. The liberal media will chalk this up as a win for them because President Trump’s accusation won’t be legitimized or something. There’s still an ongoing pattern of FBI officials going off the reservation in order to get what they want. We know they didn’t want Trump to be president. We know disgraced former FBI Director James Comey took memos he had about the meeting she had with the president and gave them to a friend who leaked them to <i>The New York Times</i>. This was done on purpose; it was meant to ensure a special counsel investigation. The <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2019/11/22/liberal-media-is-already-in-spin-mode-regarding-the-doj-ig-report-on-alleged-obamaera-fisa-abuses-n2556960">liberal media was out in full force</a> last week trying to spin the report as a dud against the anti-Trump wing of America. </p>

      <p>There seems to be a ‘see no bias’ issue at the DOJ. The FBI is the top law enforcement force in the country, but it’s also our largest domestic intelligence agency. We knew they had far-reaching surveillance powers, just look up Hoover and COINTELPRO.  Agents going rogue isn’t new. And now we have some allegation that in the process of getting a FISA spy warrant for Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign and supposed Russian collusion boogeyman, <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2019/11/22/cnn-senior-legal-analyst-peter-strzok-altering-a-fisa-warrant-is-alarming-n2556915">they altered the warrant</a>. A secret court almost always grants FISA warrants.  That’s another problem. It’s also a problem that the FBI didn’t notice that the Trump dossier, the basis for this mess, was a biased and unverified piece of political opposition research that was funded by the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Clintons retained the services of Fusion GPS, a research firm, who then hired ex-MI6 spook Christopher Steele to get dirt on Trump. The errors in the dossier prove the FBI did next to nothing to verify it. Why? Congress asked another disgraced FBI official, Andrew McCabe, about that and he didn’t want to answer the question. I wonder why. The State Department knew that the dossier was trash <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2019/05/09/uncovered-steel-dossier-authors-admission-makes-the-fbis-spy-warrant-against-t-n2546078">because Steele told them</a>, and members of British intelligence were also skeptical of the details. Then, why was this piece of political propaganda considered a credible piece of evidence in obtaining these warrants? It sounds like a sitting Democratic president’s DOJ was spying on the presidential operation of a candidate from a rival party. That sounds like an overreach, huh?</p>
      <p>Oh, and as for the spying, <i><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2019/11/27/yes-the-latest-nyt-spin-of-doj-ig-report-on-alleged-obamaera-fisa-abuses-is-as-pathetic-as-one-could-imagine-n2557186">The Times assured us that it didn’t happen</a></i>…because they said so. My eyes cannot roll hard enough with this attempt to suggest there was no spying.  The FBI wasn’t spying on the Trump campaign, they just sent their operatives to try and get information from its members without them knowing their true background and relaying said information if any to their superiors. But that’s not spying. Bloomberg’s Eli Lake tweeted, “The FBI never tried to place informants inside the Trump campaign. They only ran informants to solicit information from people who worked for the campaign. Is it just me, or does this seem like a distinction without a difference?” Larry O’Connor, a Washington Times editor and radio host for WMAL’s afternoon drive, also mocked this spin when the publication tried to pass that off months ago. This was when the story about some person named Azra Turk was sent by the FBI to oversee an operation that included Stefan Halper, the other FBI informant who was trying to get information from George Papadopoulos, Sam Clovis, and Carter Page. It was the London rendezvous during the 2016 election cycle. Alas, we have “Operation Crossfire.” Papadopoulos, one of the Trump officials targeted, said he had no issue with <i>The Times'</i> story at the time, though he thought the woman named Turk was CIA, not FBI. Even then the headline for that story was “FBI Used Informant to Investigate Russia Ties to Campaign, Not Spy.” Yeah, that’s like someone declaring that they’re not vegan, they just don’t eat anything from animals. </p>

      <p>It’s simply not believable that there was no bias at the DOJ/FBI during the 2016 cycle. Folks, have we forgotten the other <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2019/08/14/judicial-watch-finds-documents-showing-fusion-gps-working-directly-with-doj-to-frame-trump-with-ties-to-russia-n2551685">Trump dossier-DOJ link </a>here with <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2018/08/20/trump-will-doj-ever-fire-bruce-ohr-n2511381">Bruce Ohr</a>? The former top DOJ official, whose wife worked at Fusion, had contact with Christopher Steele and <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2019/03/11/former-doj-official-bruce-ohr-and-his-fusion-gps-wife-had-breakfast-with-british-spy-chistopher-steele-n2542935">tried to keep that hidden</a>, a move that led to his demotion.</p>
      <p>Even the ‘there was no spying’ counterpunch is weak. James Clapper, Obama’s former spy czar, even said what the FBI did here fit the dictionary definition of spying. And with the media having tripped over so many rakes in being wrong with their coverage of Trump due to their bias—none of this is believable. We’ll have the details here later.</p>
