      <p>The Federal Communication Commission has given the all-clear for the Mac Pro, with both the tower and rack-mounted version of the Mac workstation clearing regulatory checks for radio frequency emissions.</p>

      <p>Initially revealed at WWDC 2019 alongside the new <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac-pro">Mac Pro</a> for conventional usage at a desk, little has been heard about the version that is intended to be mounted in a rack and used as a server. However, FCC regulatory filings about the device have surfaced, confirming it is on the way and could arrive soon. <br/><br/>The <a href="https://fccid.io/BCGA2304/Test-Report/Part-15B-report-4541317">filing</a> for model number A2304 offer no real major details about the model other than what is already known or expected, such as its appearance. A photograph showing the test setup for the rack-mount Mac Pro shows it to look very close to the version briefly displayed in an image on the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/11/inside-apples-fantastically-fast-new-mac-pro">WWDC stage</a>, complete with the signature metal lattice and two handles in the front. <br/><br/>Other than the alternate enclosure, it is highly probable the internals will be the same as for the regular Mac Pro, complete with all of the possible upgrade options. <br/><br/>One detail from the filing is that the unit measures 8.58 inches thick. In terms of a typical 19-inch-wide server cabinet, this means the rackable Mac Pro takes up 4.9U of space at 1.75 inches per "U", equating to a 5U enclosure. <br/><br/>Apple is anticipated to start taking orders for the Mac Pro <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/12/07/mac-pro-pro-display-xdr-orders-start-december-10">on Tuesday</a>, but it remains to be seen whether the rack-mountable variant will be offered at the same time.</p>
