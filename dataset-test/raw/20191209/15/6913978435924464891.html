      <p><b>KARBALA, Iraq —</b> A prominent civil society activist was shot dead late Sunday in Iraq's shrine city of Karbala while returning home from anti-government protests, a neighbor said.<br/><br/>Fahem Al-Tai, 53, had been taking part in weeks of rallies denouncing Iraq's entrenched political elite as corrupt, inept and beholden to neighboring Iran.<br/><br/>On Sunday night, he was dropped off by two friends on a motorcycle near his home, according to a neighbor.<br/><br/>"The area is close to the shrines, the police station, the provincial headquarters — it's a very secure area," the neighbor said.<br/><br/>"He was with two of his friends when he was killed."<br/><br/>In footage from a street security camera seen by AFP, Tai could be seen disembarking from a motorcycle when another motorcycle with two men pulled up behind him.<br/><br/>The passenger could be seen shooting Tai at least twice with a pistol that appeared to have a silencer on it, before the driver also begins shooting.<br/><br/>The footage shows the activist collapsing and the assailants driving off.<br/><br/>The gunmen and a white vehicle then chased down the two activists who had dropped Tai off, according to a relative.<br/><br/>One of them was shot in the back but they both survived.<br/><br/>More than 450 people have died and another 20,000 have been wounded since anti-regime rallies erupted in Iraq's capital and Shiite-majority south in October.<br/><br/>They include several activists gunned down in mysterious circumstances or abducted and later found dead.<br/><br/>In one particularly gruesome case last week, the bruised body of 19-year-old Zahra Ali was left outside her family home in Baghdad, hours after she had gone missing.<br/><br/>On Friday, relatives of Zeid Al-Khafaji, a 22-year-old photographer, said he had been abducted whilst returning from Tahrir Square in the capital.<br/><br/>Protesters have for weeks complained of being monitored, threatened and harassed in an intimidation campaign meant to keep them from pursuing their movement.<br/><br/>There has been minimal accountability for the casualties or the kidnappings.<br/><br/>Tai, married with children, had been publicly critical of other intimidation attempts against protesters.<br/><br/>"We will be victorious and our country will return, despite you. Despite the pain inside us, we will smile. Despite you, despite your rotten parties," he wrote on Facebook less than a day before he died. — AFP</p>
