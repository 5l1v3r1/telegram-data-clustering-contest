      <p>Ole Miss fans are loving their new head coach.</p>
      <p>A good number of them showed up to greet new football coach Lane Kiffin when he landed in Oxford on Sunday evening. A fan in attendance handed over his baby to Kiffin in order to take a picture.</p>
      <p>Following that picture, Kiffin hanbded the baby back and receives some advice from a guy.</p>
      <p>“Get you a burner phone, alright?” the fan said to Kiffin.</p>

      <p>You may be wondering why he would tell him that. It all stems from the controversy that led to the downfall of former Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze when the program uncovered him using a cell phone to call female escort services and massage parlors.</p>
      <p>He initially denied it, but would soon apologize for his actions.</p>
      <p>“While I realize a statement from me could be met with criticism and more negative attention, I believe I owe the Ole Miss family an apology for the pain and disappointment I’ve caused them,” Freeze said in a statement released two months after his resignation. “With this being an open week for the football team, and with the NCAA hearing behind us, this seemed to be the right time for me to speak from my heart.</p>
      <p>“As you know, in July of this year Ross Bjork asked me about a concerning number discovered in my phone records. In the days that followed, I shared with him the truth about my past, ultimately resulting in my resignation. It’s a truth I’d already shared with my wife, Jill, and with two of my closest friends months earlier.</p>
      <p>“While some of the things being reported about the matter are inaccurate, or in some cases completely false, it’s much more important for me to tell you that what I did was wrong, and there’s no justification for me making the selfish decisions that I knowingly made. I know I’ve hurt many people, especially those in the Ole Miss family, and I am asking you to forgive me for what I’ve done. I miss being a part of Ole Miss but will be pulling for our team every Saturday this season. To my faith family, I ask for your forgiveness and appreciate your prayers as well.”</p>
      <p>Sounds like that fan gave him some good advice.</p>
