      <h1>Scrooges ban tenants from putting Christmas wreaths on their doors</h1>

      <p>Tenants at a housing association have been told to remove Christmas wreaths from their doors because they are a fire hazard.</p>
      <p>Landlords say they could spread a blaze and also block people from getting outside in an emergency.</p>
      <p>Samantha Kruszczak, one of the residents at the block of flats in Windsor, Berkshire, had put up a wreath on her door.</p>
      <p>She received a letter telling her to remove it within two days or see it confiscated.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old has been in the same flat for two decades and never had a problem with her artificial wreath made up of fake foliage, pine cones and berries before.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Merry B****y Christmas.</p>

      <p>‘It’s been okay for the 20 years I’ve been here. I have my wreath up every year.</p>
      <p>‘And its the same wreath I always use.</p>
      <p>‘Bah Ffing Humbug.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘It’s to do with being a trip and fire hazard.’</p>
      <p>Another resident in another street in the royal town fumed: ‘It is ridiculous.</p>
      <p>‘We have an artificial Christmas tree inside made of the same stuff.</p>
      <p>‘But that’s okay. It doesn’t make any sense.’</p>

      <p>The letters told tenants if their wreaths were confiscated, they would have to book an appointment within a month to get them back.</p>
      <p>However, they would still not be able to put them back up and would have to pay a £10 fee.</p>
      <p>If they wee not collected they would be disposed of.</p>
      <p>Sandra Theckston, Assistant Director of Housing at the Radian Group said: ‘The festive period is a time to celebrate and we want all our residents to have a happy and safe Christmas.</p>
      <p>‘Our policies are always designed in the best interests of customer safety, and our commitment to keeping communal areas clear applies at all times of the year including the holiday season.</p>
      <p>‘This approach is based on the advice of fire and rescue services and ensures that communal areas are free of any items that could continue the spread of fire or impede safe evacuation of a building in the event of a fire.</p>
      <p>‘We have, and continue to take, steps to communicate our policy to all our residents and appreciate their cooperation in helping to keep everyone safe by ensuring communal areas are kept clear all year round.’</p>
