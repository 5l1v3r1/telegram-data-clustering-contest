      <h1>'Rapist prison guards forced female inmates to have threesome with them'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:24:25+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author">Jimmy McCloskey</a></address>
      <p>Guards at a scandal-hit prison forced female inmates to have threesomes with them and sunbathe topless, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Staff at Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Wildwood, Florida, are also accused of forcing a woman to perform oral sex.</p>
      <p>A third woman – one of 14 former inmates who have now filed a lawsuit – said she was raped by a guard in a remote trailer, who then said: ‘You know they’ve accused me before of rape, but they’re never going to believe you.’</p>
      <p>Seven of those who are suing have agreed to be named, with Gina Hernandez the woman who says she was forced into threesomes and to sunbathe topless.</p>
      <p>She told the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/florida-prisons/article238130204.html">Miami Herald</a> that the facility’s layout, with multiple buildings and wooded paths, makes it easy for abusive guards to take advantage of inmates.</p>
      <p>The Herald’s investigation so shocked Florida Senator Marco Rubio that he has now urged the Bureau of Prisons to conduct a review of Coleman</p>
      <p>Writing to the Bureau, Rubio said: ‘These allegations are simply abhorrent, and I urge you to take immediate action to ensure such behavior is neither happening, nor tolerated, at FCC Coleman or any other BOP facility.’</p>
      <p>Another woman, who did not wish to give her name, said that during her spell at Coleman between 2014 and 2018 sexual abuse by guards was ‘an open secret.’</p>
      <p>One officer, who has been named in the lawsuit and has since resigned, would break rules by entering women’s dorms unannounced, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>He would then ‘pull up a chair’ and hang around if a woman was getting dressed, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Those women who are suing are seeking compensation and for sweeping reforms to ensure no other female inmates suffer the same kind of abuse they say they endured.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Coleman refused to comment.</p>
