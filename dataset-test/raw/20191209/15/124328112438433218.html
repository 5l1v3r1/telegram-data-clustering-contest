      <p>Tourists on Australia's biggest cruise ship are 'grateful' they decided to stay on board after passengers and crew members were caught up in New Zealand's volcano tragedy.  </p>
      <p>At least five people died in the powerful eruption on White Island, also known as Whakaari, at 2.11pm local time on Monday when an estimated 50 tourists were on or around the volcano crater.</p>
      <p>Eighteen survivors were evacuated - some suffering severe burns - leaving an estimated 27 people unaccounted for. </p>
      <p>Australians were among the visitors on Whakaari from a nearby cruise ship, the Ovation of the Seas, which originated in Sydney.  </p>

      <p>The vessel, which has 4579 passengers and 1595 crew on board, is docked in Tauranga, 90 kilometres from White Island. </p>
      <p>Kasey Bebrouth, who lives in Ipswich, Queensland, wrote on Facebook she was safe on the cruise ship after choosing not to tour the island.</p>
      <p>'Okay so me and Marty are on the Ovation of the Seas and yes people have been hurt,' she wrote.</p>
      <p>'The boat is staying overnight. At this point we are OK but very grateful that we stayed on the ship.</p>
      <p>'We thank everyone for their kind words and worries. We will post more when we know more, just know that we are safe.' </p>
      <p>Her friend Stephen Irvine told <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nz-volcano-tragedy-inside-the-cruise-ship-that-turned-into-a-nightmare/news-story/1918d8576354a3bc05d8bbdd1b8b9ff0"><b>News Corp</b></a> he had been messaging the mother-of-one after the eruption and she said she saw injured passengers covered in ash being carried back to the boat.  </p>
      <p>'The passengers have been offered counselling,' Mr Irvine said.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Wright, whose Facebook says she's a lighting technician at Royal Caribbean International, also wrote a status about being safely docked at Tauranga.</p>

      <p>'This is absolutely tragic. I'm on Ovation of the Seas,' Ms Wright wrote.</p>
      <p>'We're docked overnight in Tauranga hoping and waiting for news and the return of our crew and passengers. </p>
      <p>'Keep them in your thoughts and if you pray, hold them there too.'  </p>
      <p>The captain of the vessel announced one crew member and a group of passengers were on the island when the volcano erupted, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12292240"><b>New Zealand Herald </b></a>reported.  </p>
      <p>Passenger Nigel Walker, from Wollongong, south of Sydney, extended his thoughts to those missing.   </p>
      <p>'It's tragic... I was only saying to my mother-in-law before the cruise that White Island would be a great place to visit,' he said. </p>
      <p>Royal Caribbean issued a statement saying the ship would stay in the nearby port overnight 'until we learn more about the situation'.</p>
      <p>The vessel, which embarked on a 12-day cruise from Sydney, was supposed to sail to Wellington on Monday evening before touring New Zealand’s South Island and returning to Circular Quay.  </p>
      <p>Michael Schade, a traveller from San Francisco, said his tour group was standing at the edge of the main crater less than 30 minutes before the blast. </p>

      <p>'Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable.'</p>

      <p>Brazilian tourist Allessandro Kauffmann, who was on a tour to the island, shared a series of Instagram stories throughout the day and said he fled moments before the eruption.  </p>
      <p>'Some people have extensive burns on their bodies. Two tours on the volcano. Ours was the first. The other one right after,' he said after escaping. </p>

      <p>'It is important that we consider the health and safety of those that are going to rescue those on the island. So we will be taking that advice.'   </p>
