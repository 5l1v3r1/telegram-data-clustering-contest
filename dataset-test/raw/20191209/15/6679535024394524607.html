      <p>Telangana has become a haven for boozers, said former minister and BJP leader D K Aruna.</p>
      <p>She was here on Monday to console the family members of a teenage girl who was molested and killed by her friend recently and to meet the Governor of Telangana. Speaking to media persons, she said Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who promised Bangaru Telangana, has in fact turned the State into a liquor haven.</p>
      <p>“The uncontrolled sale of liquor in the State is one of the main reasons for growing crime against women,” she said.</p>
      <p>The BJP leader said she has plans to go on a two-day hunger strike at Indira Park in Hyderabad from December 11, demanding that the government impose liquor prohibition in the State.</p>
      <p>Referring to the teenage girl’s rape and murder case, Aruna accused the police of showing discrimination as the girl hails from a low-profile family. “The police who arrested one person were trying to goof up the case by allowing the others to go scot-free . Even though the victim’s parents raised some doubts the police are not ready to listen,” Aruna alleged.</p>
      <p>Justice should be the same, whether the victim belongs to an ordinary family or high profile, she said, demanding that the government constitute a fast track court. She found fault with the police for allegedly forcing the victim’s parents to come to the police station time and again. Further she alleged that a MLA was asking the victim’s family to meet him. BJP Warangal Urban District president Rao Padma and other senior leaders were present.</p>
