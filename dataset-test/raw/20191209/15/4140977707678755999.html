          <p>Arsenal’s star striker is rumoured to end his time at Arsenal and wish to grab a new challenge in his career. With lack of progression at the club, the Gabon International views it as the right decision.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-ready-quit-21042346">The Mirror</a> say Aubameyang was in negotiations over a contract extension to his current deal, which expires in 18 months, but he is now ready to quit the club for a new challenge in the summer.</p>

                      <p>Moreover, with Aubameyang soon entering into the last phase of his career would surely be looking ahead for winning trophies but it doesn’t seem the North London club can achieve it for the Gabonese International in the current state.</p>
                      <p>Arsenal lost their fourth game of the season on Thursday, with the 2-1 defeat to Brighton in Freddie Ljungberg’s second game in charge leaving the North London side in 11th place in the league going into the game against West Ham.</p>

                            <p>Even though Arsenal has remained underwhelming throughout Aubameyang’s stint, yet he has provided brilliant performances for the Gunners. The 31-year old striker has bagged 53 goals in 83 appearances ever since he completed his £58 million move in 2018.</p>
