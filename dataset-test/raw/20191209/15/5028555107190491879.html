      <p>2020 will bring all the usual yearly updates from all the usual phone vendors, but one interesting new addition is a cheaper smartphone from OnePlus. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/oneplus-7-pro-review-the-fastest-best-designed-best-value-android-phone/">king of value flagship</a> smartphones is making what looks like a midrange device.</p>
      <p>The news comes to us from <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-8-lite-renders-design-punch-hole-display-camera/">OnLeaks and 91Mobiles</a>, which have whipped up CAD-based renders of the device. <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1203196094781505536">OnLeaks says</a> there's no name for the device yet, but for now, the report is going with "OnePlus 8 Lite." The render shows a device with a flat display measuring somewhere around 6.4-inches and a front camera that lives in a hole punch in the middle of the display, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/galaxy-note10-hands-on-samsung-falls-behind-the-competition/">just like a Samsung device</a>. The hole-punch camera is apparently the design OnePlus will go with across its lineupâ€”OnLeaks has released "<a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-8-pro-renders-images-quad-cameras-punch-hole-display-exclusive/">OnePlus 8 Pro</a>" renders earlier, featuring this same Samsung-y front camera design.</p>
      <p>Other features on the render include two cameras and a lot of sensors on the back, a USB-C port and speaker on the bottom, and a physical mute switch on the side. It's hard to imagine an Android phone shipping without a fingerprint reader (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/google-pixel-4-review-overpriced-uncompetitive-and-out-of-touch/">unless you're Google</a>, I guess), so an in-screen fingerprint reader is probably included. There's no headphone jack, which is a shame for a mid-range device.</p>
      <p>The design doesn't really matter, though. What we're mainly interested in are the specs and price, which are mysteries for now. OnePlus regularly delivers the best bang-for-your-buck in the industry, and having the company build something cheaper than a flagship smartphone has the potential for greatness. For now, we'll have to be on the lookout for more info before the launch sometime next year.</p>
