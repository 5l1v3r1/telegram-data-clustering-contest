      <h1>Epic is accused of stealing ‘Dancing Pumpkin Man’ look for a Fortnite dance</h1>
      <h2>Epic filed a legal complaint defending itself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:34:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/adi-robertson" target="_blank">Adi Robertson</a></address>
      <p><i>Fortnite</i> creator Epic Games is trying to avoid yet another lawsuit over dance emotes. The company preemptively <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.527927/gov.uscourts.nysd.527927.1.0.pdf">filed a complaint</a> against Matt Geiler, also known as <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-untold-story-of-the-dancing-pumpkin-man">the “Dancing Pumpkin Man”</a> from a 2006 viral video. Geiler reportedly told Epic to stop offering a Halloween-themed emote called “Pump It Up,” which copies his dance and briefly gives avatars a jack-o’-lantern for a head. Now, Epic is asking courts to declare that it didn’t infringe Geiler’s trademark or copyright.</p>
      <p>Epic has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184401/epic-games-fortnite-dance-emote-legal-lawsuit-2-milly-carlton-floss">faced several lawsuits</a> over dance emotes, including one from <i>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i> star Alfonso Ribeiro. But this case is a little different. Where most suits have hinged purely on dance moves, Geiler apparently says the combined dance and pumpkin head constitute a recognizable character. Also, unlike the other cases, Epic previously struck a licensing deal with Geiler — something he’s mentioned in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mattgeiler/videos/10156656261851589/">a Facebook post</a> comment and <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-untold-story-of-the-dancing-pumpkin-man">a <i>Mel Magazine</i> profile</a>. The complaint doesn’t explain why Geiler sent a cease-and-desist letter after reaching this deal, but it indicates that he discussed suing Epic over the use of his likeness.</p>
      <p>Epic’s preemptive complaint makes some standard defenses. It says that <i>Fortnite</i> doesn’t reference the Dancing Pumpkin Man name, the emote uses a different-looking jack-o’-lantern, and Geiler made a “clear admission” that he’d licensed the likeness. Epic also (presumably) paid someone to find every other pumpkin-headed character ever created, including one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_O%27Lantern_(Marvel_Comics)">silliest-looking Spider-Man villains ever created</a>, to prove Geiler’s look isn’t unique.</p>
      <p>Most of the <i>Fortnite</i> dance suits were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257385/epic-fortnite-lawsuit-ribeiro-2milly-dance-emote-lawsuits-withdrawn-pause-registration">temporarily withdrawn earlier this year</a>, following a Supreme Court decision that required people to register a copyright before suing. Another performer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516306/fortnite-epic-games-phone-it-in-saxophone-emote-lawsuit-leo-pellegrino-likeness">filed a lawsuit in April</a>, but the case covered appropriating his likeness, not infringing a copyright.</p>
