      <h1>Finland to get youngest ever PM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:07:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/tarmo-virki/" target="_blank">Tarmo Virki</a></address>
      <p>Finland’s transportation minister Sanna Marin has been selected by her Social Democratic party to become the country’s youngest prime minister ever, taking over after the resignation of Antti Rinne.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old Marin, whose party is the largest in a five-member governing coalition, will be the world’s youngest serving prime minister when she takes office in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Mr Rinne resigned on Tuesday after a party in the coalition, the Centre Party, said it had lost confidence in him following his handling of a postal strike.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of work ahead to rebuild trust,” Ms Marin told reporters after winning a narrow vote among the party leadership on Sunday. Antti Lindtman, head of the party’s parliamentary group, was runner-up.</p>
      <p>Ms Marin has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27.</p>

      <p>She will take over in the middle of a three-day wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland’s largest companies from Monday. The Confederation of Finnish Industries estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($A808 million) in lost revenue.</p>
      <p>The centre-left coalition, which took office just six months ago, has agreed to continue with its political program stressing a shift to carbon neutrality, after Mr Rinne announced he was stepping down at the demand of the Centre Party.</p>
      <p>“We have a joint government program which glues the coalition together,” Ms Marin said.</p>
      <p>The timing of the change in leadership is awkward for Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year, playing a central role in efforts to hammer out a new budget for the bloc.</p>
