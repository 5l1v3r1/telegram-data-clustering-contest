      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian finance ministry said on Monday it remained confident that the UK Supreme Court would rule in Moscow's favor in a Russia-Ukraine $3 billion Eurobond case, it said in a statement.</p>

      <p>The finance ministry also said Moscow's total claims to Ukraine, including interest payments, came to about $4.5 billion.</p>
