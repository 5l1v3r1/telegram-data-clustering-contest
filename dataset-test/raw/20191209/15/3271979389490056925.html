      <p><b>Jennifer Aniston</b> and <b>Justin Theroux</b>’s romance is not “back on,” despite an untrue tabloid report. Although the ex-spouses are on good terms, they haven’t rekindled a romance. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can clear up the situation.</p>
      <p>Theroux attended his ex-wife’s annual Friendsgiving dinner this year, along with famous pals such as Courteney Cox, Jimmy Kimmel and Jason Bateman. That’s all <i><b>Woman’s Day</b></i> needed to decide that Aniston is giving her romance with Theroux another shot. “Jen and Justin have realized just how much they still mean to each other,” a supposed source tells the outlet. “They’re speaking virtually every day and Justin spent an entire week at Jen’s LA home over Thanksgiving.”</p>
      <p>The magazine further contends that Aniston has told pals she believes she gave up on their marriage too quickly, and wishes she tried harder. “Jen was so scarred from her divorce from Brad [Pitt], but after working with the same therapist for several years, she realizes now she tends to put a wall up as soon as things get tough, rather than working through them,” adds the suspicious tipster. “It’s dawned on her now that Justin was everything she wanted in a partner, and she’s beginning to feel as though the lost the best thing in her life. She can’t help but feel hugely regretful.”</p>
      <p>The seemingly made-up insider claims it was Cox who encouraged Aniston to invite her ex over for Thanksgiving, which “felt like a big risk and she was terrified he might reject her, but he jumped at the chance.” The alleged source adds, “He ended up staying with Jen for a week. She says it felt like the old days when they were married, and it reminded them again just how much they love each other.” The “insider” concludes, “Jen has decided life is too short not to give this another try. She’s excited about seeing where things go.”</p>
      <p>The tabloid’s phony story was concocted simply because Aniston and Theroux reunited for her Friendsgiving celebration. The friendly exes aren’t back together. <b>Gossip Cop</b> reached out to individuals close to both stars, who tell us they haven’t rekindled a romance. We’re further assured that Theroux didn’t spend the week at his ex-wife’s house over Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>It should be noted, <i>Woman’s Day</i> has spent a lot of time insisting that Aniston was getting back together with Pitt. Less than a month ago, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the tabloid for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-peoples-choice-awards/">Pitt surprised Aniston with flowers backstage at the People’s Choice Awards</a>. That never happened, and now the magazine is switching over to Theroux instead. The <i>Friends</i> star isn’t rekindling a romance with either of her ex-husbands.</p>
      <p>Also less than a month ago, the unreliable magazine made up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-justin-theroux-serious-dating/">Theroux dating Katie Holmes</a>. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked that report after learning the two stars don’t even know each other. The outlet clearly has trouble keeping track of its phony narratives, which are contradictory and all over the place.</p>
