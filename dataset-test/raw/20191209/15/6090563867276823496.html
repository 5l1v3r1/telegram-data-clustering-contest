      <p>If I was the President, there would not be a single Mushurugwi breathing right now. I would have ordered that they not be captured and arrested but put down on sight like the rabid dogs they are.<br/>The viral video on WhatsApp of those diseased terrorists murdering 2 men in full view of a sizable crowd is traumatising and proof that they are no longer humans but two legged animals that have to be put down for the safety and security of the public.</p>
      <p>But is it a coincidence that the terrorist Mashurugwi became a full menace with the ascension of Emmerson Mnangagwa to the highest office in the land? The brutal terrorists are said to be feared by the police because they enjoy the protection of Owen Ncube, Minister of the CIO. The Americans recently added this man to the sanctions list after having received credible intelligence that he is associated with Mashurugwi who commit heinous murders and are allowed to continue doing so by the evil Mnangagwa regime.</p>
      <p>Mnangagwa is as soft as wool with Mashurugwi but turns into a Nile crocodile when hungry Zimbabweans go onto the streets to demonstrate against their suffering.<br/>Many people say Mnangagwa mu korokoza and he is also associated with madzura moyo aya so why would he unleash security forces against them?</p>
      <p>Mr Mugabe was a lot of things but no way would he have stood for those animals butchering people in broad day like that. Do you even have to wonder why people increasingly believe Mr Mugabe was far better than the horrible and heartless man occupying the office of the President right now?</p>
      <p>The man is not fit to run a hamburger stand, much less an entire country! No doctors, no teachers, no electricity, no water, no fuel, no jobs, no action on Mashurugwi and he has time for Mazondo and selfies , high up in the skies?</p>
      <p>May be we should have listened to G40. The man has turned out to be all that they said he was. Just listen to Matemadanda’s genocidal utterances. Just read some of Mutodi’s twitter posts. You will certainly see just how fucked we are!</p>
      <p>A lot of people have over the years warned Mnangagwa is evil and some of us thought the frightening stories told about him were exaggerations. But now I believe them to be wholly true. Even ya Godfrey Majonga. We should have listened. Evil, evil, pure evil he is.</p>
