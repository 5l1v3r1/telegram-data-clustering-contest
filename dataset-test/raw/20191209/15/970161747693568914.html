      <h1>It's so cold in China an entire river has frozen over</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:29:23+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Basit Mahmood</a></address>
      <p>A cold snap in China that has seen temperatures plummet, has led to one of the major rivers in the country freezing.</p>
      <p>Hun River, which is 258 miles long and is located in northeast China’s Liaoning province and runs through the city of Shenyang, has completely frozen.</p>
      <p>Pictures show hundreds of cars on a bridge above the river, with the frozen ice covering the landscape below.</p>
      <p>Temperatures in Shenyang city are currently at -4C.</p>
      <p>The freezing conditions coincided with what is referred to in the Chinese calendar as the day of Daxue, a Chinese solar term that is translated as the Great Snow, which falls on December 7<sup>th</sup> or 8<sup>th</sup> every year.</p>
      <p>The cold weather in the country has also moved towards upper Thailand, claiming three lives yesterday in three provinces.</p>
