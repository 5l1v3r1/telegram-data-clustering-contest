      <h1>Robbie Williams teases he'd be up for I'm A Celebrity next year</h1>
      <h2>It might cost a few quid to get him on board, though</h2>

      <p>Robbie Williams could be heading to the Aussie jungle next year - and not because he intends to be touring down under.</p>
      <p>The Angels singing star joked he might be keen on taking part in next year's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> during his ITV special last night.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m A Celeb hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec</a> made a cameo appearance for a skit via video link on his Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show - and following some banter about how many viewers would be watching their respective shows, Robbie made his case to be among the 2020 campmates.</p>
      <p>"What about the next series? Any guests lined up, yeah?" he said as he pointed out his 'supper'.</p>

      <p>Whipping away a cloche as he revealed a plate of fake mealworms and wallaby anus, Robbie pantomimed auditioning for the ITV reality series.</p>
      <p>"Someone was telling me the bigger the star, the more you get paid," Robbie added, with a wink and nudge.</p>
      <aside>How am I looking for the next series?</aside>
      <p>He chuckled: "So a really famous singer will get paid millions for going on I'm A Celebrity, right?"</p>
      <p>Swallowing down the alleged Bush tucker treats, Robbie pretended to be repulsed by the offerings.</p>

      <p>"Those bugs are so disgusting... but I am going to eat them anyway to make great prime time television," he said sarcastically.</p>
      <p>As if on a wind up, Ant and Dec encouraged him to carry on chomping as Robbie plumped for a spot of anus.</p>
      <p>"Stuff your face!" suggested Ant.</p>
      <p>Dec chimed in: "Fill your boots!"</p>
      <p>A mock-hopeful Robbie then enquired: "How am I looking for the next series?"</p>
      <p>The Geordie duo replied they were "impressed" and "amazed" before letting Robbie down gently.</p>

      <p>"We're not the people who book the celebs," Ant concluded as Robbie spat out the remnants of whatever it was he'd had in his gob.</p>
      <p>"Enjoy your dinner!" Dec signed off.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for nothing," Robbie splutter as the last word on the matter.</p>
      <p>Fans seemed to love the sketch, with many tweeting about it on social media.</p>

      <p>"That 'Not Live' segment with Ant &amp; Dec was just top telly!" said one Twitter user.</p>
      <p>"Omg Ant and Dec were on Not The Robbie Williams Show!!!" added another excited fan.</p>
      <p>Another person remarked: "Watching not the Robbie Williams Christmas show and @antanddec made a short appearance. In Oz and still get everywhere haha not that I'm complaining."</p>
