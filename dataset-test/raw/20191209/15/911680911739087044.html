      <p>The Phoenix Business Journal is gearing up for its biggest event of the year — think of the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve all rolled into one party.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Best Places to Work awards are set for Dec. 12 at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort &amp; Spa, with more than 650 people expected as the winners are named.</p>
      <p>Though the attendees like to have fun and show their team spirit, make no mistake, human resources managers and company leaders take the Best Places to Work nominations very seriously, considering how important they are for recruiting and employee retention.</p>
      <p>The Business Journal will publish its annual Best Places to Work special section in the Dec. 13 weekly edition, in which all the rankings will be revealed and where the top companies in the five size categories will outline their strategies for keeping employees engaged, enlightened and invigorated.</p>
