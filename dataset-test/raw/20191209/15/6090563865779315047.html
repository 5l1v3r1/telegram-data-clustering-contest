      <p>SOUTH AFRICA: Foreigners in the City of Cape Town face a bleak festive season after the City applied an urgent court interdict to have them arrested and deported back to their countries of origin.</p>
      <p>The group, who have been camped at the Methodist church in Greenmarket Square are refusing to be deported back to their countries citing persecution and death. The group has been living in the corridors of the Waldorf Arcade for the almost a month, in the hopes of catching the attention of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Cape Town City council is not happy with the group “polluting” the city and say the conditions are not conducive for human settlement therefore they need to be “removed”.</p>
      <p>Earlier in November, under a court order, the same group consisting of women and children was arrested but later released.</p>
