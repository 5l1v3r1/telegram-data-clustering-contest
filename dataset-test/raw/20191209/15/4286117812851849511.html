      <p>Foul smell emanating from the suitcase of a man traveling in an auto in Thane near Mumbai, led to the revelation of a spine-chilling crime. This time, choosing to stay with the man of her choice, cost a woman her life - once again.</p>
      <p>The murderer? Her father. Unable to digest the fact that his daughter excercised her choice to stick to the man she loved, he killed her. Such was the rage, that merely killing was not enough. He also chopped her body. However, only the bottom part of her body was recovered, and it was chopped into three parts, most probably to fit in the suitcase.</p>
      <p>The crime came to fore, when an auto driver, in which the accused father was travelling with the suitcase, opened the attach√© and found the chopped body parts of the woman. The accused had fled leaving the suitcase in the auto when the auto driver questioned him on the foul smell emanating from the bag.</p>
      <p>Without any clues on identity of the deceased or the accused, the Thane crime branch launched an investigation and traced a man named Arvind Tiwari. Aged 47, Tiwari, a resident of Titwala, confessed that the deceased was his daughter and she was in relationship with a man, of whom he disapproved. This led to an altercation between him and his daughter.</p>
      <p>Tiwari said that despite repeated warnings when his daughter, 22-year-old Princey, did not listen to him, he killed her.</p>
      <p>The man has been taken into custody and is being interrogated to find out more about the murder and other parts of the deceased.</p>
      <p>The man was tracked down with the help of CCTV footage from where the accused had fled the auto near Kalyan railway station. Then CCTV footage was also recovered from Titwala railway station, from where he boarded the train with the suitcase. CCTV grabs were also taken of the area from where the accused had boarded the rickshaw. The photographs of the accused were shown to locals who helped the police identify him and reach his residence.</p>
      <p>It was found that the daughter had come from her native place in Jaunpur just four months ago after completing her graduation to work and help the family. The accused stayed alone in Titwala while his four daughters and wife stayed in Jaunpur. Princey worked in a Bhandup-based private firm as a clerk. It was here that she got into a relationship, which was opposed by the father who feared that her relationship would create hurdles for the marriage of her younger sister, and defame the family. This altercation led to her brutal death.</p>
