        <b>Kim Kardashian, an American reality TV star, has threatened to fire her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, from the ‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’ cast for hiding part of her private life.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The reality show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian family.</p>
      <p>Kim and Khloe have been slugging out with Kourtney in recent times over the latter’s refusal to be “open enough” on the cameras when it comes to her love life — amid prior suspicions with regard to Kourtney’s absence.</p>
      <p>In the recent episode, Kim and Khloé confronted their sister after she showed up to filming with a hickey but refused to talk about it.</p>
      <p>“Our job is being open and honest and sharing a lot of ourselves. And it just seems like Kourtney hasn’t really been open about her personal life on camera. All of the days that Kourtney isn’t filming, Khloé and I are picking up the slack and having to share more,” she said.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Kris Jenner, their mother, Kim added: “We have a proposal. It starts with an F and ends with a D. Everyone needs a consequence. Let’s show her. If she doesn’t want to show up, if she doesn’t want to work and she has too many boundaries, then she’s out.”</p>
      <p>In defense, Kourtney said: “My sisters are nosy when it comes to anything in my life. I try to keep certain things private. I don’t like to share about dating. I don’t know if they are bored in their own lives and they want to live through my wild dating life that they think is going on”.</p>
