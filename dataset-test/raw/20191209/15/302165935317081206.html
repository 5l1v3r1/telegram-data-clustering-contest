      <p>LOS ANGELES, Dec 9 — Netflix dominated the Golden Globe nominations today as its heart-wrenching divorce saga <i>Marriage Story</i> grabbed six nods including best drama, kicking off the race for the Oscars.</p>
      <p>The streaming giant secured a whopping 17 film nominations unveiled at a Beverly Hills ceremony, trouncing the competition from Hollywood studios among whom Sony finished second with just eight.</p>
      <p>“I’m not surprised by the dominance — I’m surprised by how massive the dominance is,” Lorenzo Soria, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, told AFP.</p>
      <p>“The announcements this morning are sort of like a coming of age of the streaming services.”</p>
      <p><i>The Irishman</i>, Martin Scorsese’s three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic also from Netflix, secured five nominations, ending tied for second with <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, Quentin Tarantino’s nostalgic love letter to 1960s Tinseltown.</p>
      <p>The nominations traditionally see the stars and movies destined for awards success start to break away from the competition — the Globes are seen as a key bellwether for February’s Academy Awards.</p>
      <p><i>Marriage Story</i> earned nominations for its stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, and for its screenplay, but director Noah Baumbach missed out.</p>
      <p>The film portrays how a seemingly stable love can be ripped apart after Johansson’s actress moves from New York to Los Angeles, calling in the lawyers as she separates from a narcissistic theatre director played by Driver.</p>
      <p>Scorsese was nominated for best director for <i>Irishman</i> but there was no best actor nod for his leading man Robert De Niro. Instead, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci were both selected for supporting roles.</p>
      <p>For <i>Once Upon a Time...</i> there were acting nods for A-listers Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie.</p>
      <p>Netflix’s Vatican drama <i>The Two Popes</i> also performed well for the streamer, while dark comic book tale <i>Joker</i> received recognition in best drama, best actor (Joaquin Phoenix) and best director.</p>

      <p>Underlining its supremacy, Netflix also secured the most television nominations. The latest series of royal family drama <i>The Crown</i>, which features an all-new cast led by Olivia Colman, secured a joint-top four nominations, as did the streaming giant’s limited series <i>Unbelievable</i>.</p>
      <p>Netflix managed 17 television nominations, to its rival HBO’s 15.</p>
      <p>Apple’s new batch of television shows for its streaming platform Apple TV+, launched last month, secured their first three nominations, all for flagship launch programme <i>The Morning Show</i>.</p>
      <p>Lead actresses Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who also executive-produced the series about a morning news programme hit by a #MeToo scandal, were both nominated.</p>
      <p>Today’s nominations were announced at an early-morning Beverly Hills ceremony by actor Tim Allen (<i>Toy Story</i>) and actresses Dakota Fanning (<i>I Am Sam</i>) and Susan Kelechi Watson (<i>This Is Us</i>).</p>
      <p>The 77th Golden Globes will take place in Los Angeles on January 5, two days before voting for Oscars nominees ends.</p>
      <p>Nods for Beyonce, Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lopez across best original song (<i>The Lion King</i>, <i>Cats</i>) and best supporting actress (<i>Hustlers</i>) will lend further star power to the gala hosted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p>
      <p>The show will be hosted by British comedian Ricky Gervais, returning for a record fifth time. — AFP</p>
