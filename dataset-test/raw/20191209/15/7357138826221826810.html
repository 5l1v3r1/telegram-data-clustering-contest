      <h1>Macy’s Spotlights Women-Owned Businesses With SoGifted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:39:53+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Macy’s is partnering with the female-led millennial venture capital fund <a href="http://www.sogalventures.com/">SoGal Ventures</a> to launch an in-store initiative focused on women-owned businesses, Macy’s said in a <a href="https://www.macysinc.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/1599/macys-launches-sogifted-a-female-entrepreneur-focused">press release</a> on Thursday (Dec. 5).</p>
      <p>The retailer is opening SoGifted shops in its flagship Manhattan store and six other locations. The pop-up shop is dedicated to selling products from a variety of women-led small businesses and will be open through January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/tag/macys/">Macy’s</a> has a minority stake in SoGal Ventures, which has invested in over 65 startups and reaches a network of more than 100,000 entrepreneurs in over 30 countries in the U.S., Asia Pacific and Europe. SoGal was co-founded by Pocket Sun and Elizabeth Galbut in 2016 and is headquartered in New York City. The two managing partners invest in diverse entrepreneurs at the seed and pre-A stage.</p>
      <p>The SoGifted shops feature products and gifts from women-founded enterprises in the SoGal community. Brands include <a href="https://lovevery.com/">Lovevery</a>, which sells expert-designed brain toys; <a href="https://neelyandchloe.com/">Neely &amp; Chloe</a>, offering fashion-forward accessories; <a href="https://hidratespark.com/products/storm-hidrate-spark-3">HidrateSpark 3</a>, a smart water bottle that tracks hydration; herbal teas from <a href="https://shopbontemps.com/">Bon Temps</a>; unbreakable hosiery by <a href="https://sheertex.com/">Sheertex</a> and more.</p>
      <p>“Our mission is to build a firm that embodies the cultural values we want to see in the world,” said Galbut. “With the partnership at Macy’s, we’re taking this a step further and giving in-store shoppers across the country an opportunity to discover and support female-led small business brands.”</p>
      <p>SoGifted shops will be located in Manhattan’s Herald Square; Atlanta’s Lenox Square; Fashion Show in Las Vegas; Boston’s Northshore; North Star Mall in San Antonio; Twelve Oaks Mall in Detroit; and The Galleria in Ft. Lauderdale.</p>
      <p>Macy’s ongoing partnership with <a href="https://b8ta.com/">b8ta</a>, which helps brands set up physical retail operations, enabled SoGal to quickly open at the department store.</p>
      <p>SoGifted will also host entrepreneurial-focused events, including a “For Women, by Women” panel discussion at Herald Square with the founders of Blume, TomboyX and Sheertex on Jan. 14 at 6:30 p.m. Beauty and trunk shows are also planned, as well as a wellness-focused event.</p>
      <p>The SoGal partnership aligns with the goal of Macy’s to double the number of <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/macys-story-themed-experiential-shops/">pop-up shops</a> within its stores.</p>
