      <h1>Juventus 'open talks with Barcelona' over Man Utd transfer target Ivan Rakitic</h1>
      <h2>The club's sporting director Fabio Paratici in believed to have discussed the prospect of signing Rakitic in a swap deal, with two Juventus players also entering the negotiations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:05:47+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc?service=responsive">Juventus</a> have reportedly entered discussions with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> over a potential swap deal for Ivan Rakitic.</p>
      <p>The Croatian midfielder has found himself on the fringes of the Barca first team this season despite playing a key role in recent seasons.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ivan-rakitic">Rakitic</a> has managed just three league starts so far this campaign, and looks set to leave the Nou Camp in the near future with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Man Utd</a> among the interested clubs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/incontro-tra-juve-e-barcellona-com-e-andata-tra-rakitic-e-i-nomi-69492">CalcioMercato report</a> that Juve have made the first move to land the 31-year-old though, and have opened talks regarding his possible transfer.</p>
      <p>They state that Rakitic could be allowed to move to Turin if Juve agree to let one of their stars head to Barcelona in return.</p>

      <p>Defenders Daniele Rugani and Merih Demiral are both believed to have been discussed in the negotiations, while Barca are keen on winger Federico Bernardeschi.</p>
      <p>Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici is said to have held meetings with Barca chiefs in an attempt to finalise an agreement ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>However it is thought that Bernardeschi will not be let go in January.</p>
      <p>Rakitic has recently played down suggestions he could be set to leave the club, after stating how he felt Barcelona was the "perfect place" for him.</p>

      <p>He said: "After recent months a lot of things happened to me. Sometimes things happen that one can’t understand but has to accept.</p>
      <p>“It happened to me. Nobody gives you anything. I want to give everything and if I can play here then I’ve always said there’s no better place than Barca to keep winning titles, it’s the perfect place for me."</p>
      <p>He has also enjoyed a mini resurgence in the Barca side, starting all of their last three matches, raising questions as to whether Ernesto Valverde would be happy to let the player leave.</p>
      <p>Should a transfer not go through in January, it could be delayed until the summer, which would then bring Bernardeschi into the equation.</p>
      <p>Juve would not be keen on doing a straight swap with their 25-year-old star in exchange for Rakitic, but could be tempted if another player was included.</p>
      <p>Paratici has expressed his admiration for young Barca defender Jean-Clair Todibo, who could be a potential option.</p>
