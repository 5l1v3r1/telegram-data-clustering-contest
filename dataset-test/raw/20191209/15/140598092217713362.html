      <h1>Golden Globes nominations 2020: streaming on top as Killing Eve, Fleabag and The Crown recognised</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:34:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>The 2020 Golden Globes nominations celebrated British talent such as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/phoebe-waller-bridge/">Pheobe Waller-Bridge</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/andrew-scott-sexy-priest-fleabag-making-catholicism-relevant/">Andrew Scott</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/taking-tiara-olivia-colman-crown-follow-another-actors-award/">Olivia Colman</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/andrew-lloyd-webber/">Andrew Lloyd-Webber</a>, but sounded a death knell for terrestrial British television with no non-streamed television shows earning recognition.</p>
      <p>The nominations, which were announced on Monday in Los Angeles by Tim Allen, Dakota Fanning and Susan Kelechi Watson, recognise the best of the year’s entertainment on television and film.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/the-crown/">The Crown</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fleabag-tv-series/">Fleabag</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/killing-eve/">Killing Eve</a> were all nominated in several categories, but all are triumphs of online television: The Crown is one of Netflix’s flagship shows, Fleabag was originally a BBC Three show and returned via the Corporation’s online channel for its second season and Killing Eve was made for BBC America after being repeatedly turned down by British production companies. </p>
      <p>Streaming networks also succeeded stateside, with Netflix films The Irishman and Marriage Story both earning four nominations a piece.<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel/"> The Marvelous Mrs Maisel</a>, which is created by Amazon Studios, was also nominated. The Morning Show, a drama from Apple TV, the newest offering on the streaming scene, performed well with two nominations, one of which for actress Jennifer Aniston. </p>
      <p>Such nominations mark a departure from the days when British terrestrial stalwarts such as Downton Abbey and The Night Manager would win in several categories. Game of Thrones, traditionally a big winner at the Golden Globes, earned just the one nomination for its critically panned final series, for Kit Harington as Best Actor in a Television Series.</p>

      <p>Alongside The Irishman and Marriage Story, the frontrunners in the film categories are Sam Mendes’ First World War epic 1917, Joker and Little Women for drama. In comedy or musical, Knives Out and Rocketman were contenders, with British actors Daniel Craig and Taron Egerton both nominated, alongside Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. </p>
      <p>Already, social media has been swift to point out omissions: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/see-us-netflix-review-harrowing-tale-central-park-five-american/">When They See Us</a>, Ava DuVernay’s drama about the five young black men who were wrongly accused and prosecuted for the rape of a woman in Central Park in 1989, received no nominations.</p>
      <p>The Best Original Song category has one of its starriest years in history, with Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, Elton John and Frozen songwriting duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez all nominated.</p>
      <p>The winners will be announced in the 77th Golden Globe Awards ceremony on January 5, hosted by Ricky Gervais.</p>
