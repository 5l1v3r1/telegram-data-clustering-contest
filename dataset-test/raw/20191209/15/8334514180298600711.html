      <p>MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s Enel has installed New York City’s biggest battery storage system, which it said on Monday will help power the Brooklyn area during periods of peak demand.</p>
      <p>The need for battery storage systems is expected to mushroom as renewable energy plays an ever-greater role in helping to power the grid when there is not enough wind or sun.</p>
      <p>NYC is looking to install 3,000 MW of energy storage by 2030 to help build a cleaner and more resilient grid and Enel said the 16.4 Megawatt hour (MWh) battery will help cut emissions by limiting the use of more carbon-intensive power.</p>
      <p>Enel, Europe’s biggest utility and one of the world’s biggest renewable energy companies, said it had developed a 4.8-megawatt lithium ion battery system near a shopping center in East New York together with real estate owner Related Companies.</p>
      <p>The battery is designed to support the local grid of New York energy company Con Edison when demand hits highs, it said in a joint statement with Related.</p>
      <p>Enel said its Gateway Center Project had so far delivered more than 100 MWh of stored electricity to the local grid.</p>
