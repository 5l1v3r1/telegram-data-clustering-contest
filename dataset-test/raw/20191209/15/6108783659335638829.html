      <h3>Time to become the hero.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/free-guy/"><i>Free Guy</i></a> is a film in which Ryan Reynolds (<i>Deadpool</i>) will star as a sentient NPC in a long-running open world multiplayer game.</p>
      <p>Reynolds will play a bank teller who discovers he’s an NPC in a video game… and worse yet, that the video game is scheduled for closure soon. He’ll be joined by Joe Keery (<i>Stranger Things</i>), Jodie Cormer (<i>Killing Eve</i>) and Takia Waititi (<i>Thor: Ragnorok, Jojo Rabbit</i>).</p>
      <p>“In a world where there are no limits, he is determined to be the guy who saves his world his way… before it is too late,” reads the film’s synopsis.</p>
      <p>Directed by Shawn Levy, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/free-guy/"><i>Free Guy</i></a> will head to theatres in July 2020.</p>
