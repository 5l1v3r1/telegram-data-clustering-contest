        <b>LEADER of Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), Gani Adams, has described as a ‘national tragedy, the invasion of the Federal High Court on Friday by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS), to forcefully rearrest the convener of #RevolutionNow, and publisher of Sahara Reporters,  Omoyele Sowore, less than 24 hours after he was released on bail.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adams said the incident showed that the rule of law was gradually dying, while the Federal Government remains helpless, noting that the situation played out at the court has only indicated that Nigeria had lost its drift as a democratic nation.</p>
      <p>He said, “With what happened at the court, it reminded me of the dark era of the military but ironically, the present government under President Muhammadu Buhari is likened to the military junta of late Sani Abacha where the military brigande held sway for years.</p>

      <p>“I have been watching events as they unfold, but I am saddened that the event that transpired in the court was a testimony that Nigeria had a long way to go.”</p>
      <p>According to him, DSS failure to respect the rule of law was a sad reminder of the military era.</p>
      <p>“This is not the democracy we fought for between 1993 and 1998,” Adams said.</p>
      <p>He however, advised President Buhari not to allow these set of people at the corridors of power to use his name and the Presidency to perpetrate evil that could later discredit his name in future.”</p>
