        <b>Cosel has announced four series of open frame, low profile, compact power supplies covering the range of 30W to 100W and UL/EN62368-1 certified.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The LHA30F, LHA50F, LHA75F and LHA100F complement Coselâ€™s existing LHA150F and LHA300F models, now offering an option for industrial applications. The power supplies have a typical efficiency up to 90% high-line and 86% low-line. In addition, noise and ripple levels have also been reduced using partial resonance technology. They operate in a temperature range from -10 to +70 degrees C.</p>

      <p>The LHA series has been designed to simplify choice for systems designers when selecting power supplies for demanding applications. All units in the LHA family are UL/EN 62368-1 certified.</p>
      <p>The power supplies have an input voltage range of 85VAC to 264VAC single phase, and conform to the safety standards input voltage range of 100-240VAC (50/60Hz).</p>
      <p>The 30W variation is available with output voltages of 3.3, 5, 12, 15 and 24V. For an broader range of applications, the LHA50-75F is available in seven output voltages, 3.3, 5, 12, 15, 24, 36 and 48V, while the LHA100F comes in output voltages of 5, 12, 15, 24 and 48V.</p>
      <p>Standard products are delivered with a factory trimmed output voltage though it is possible to order the LHA30-50-75-100F with a built-in potentiometer making it possible to adjust the voltage up and down.</p>
      <p>To reduce energy consumption when a unit is operating at light loads or is in standby, the LHA30-50-75-100F automatically switches to an energy saving mode using intermittent pulse modulation. The power supplies include inrush current protection, over-current protection with automatic recovery when the default is removed, and over-voltage protection.</p>
      <p>They can be mounted in any orientation, though depending on the ambient temperature and environment a derating may apply.</p>
      <p>The power supplies comply with FCC-B, VCCI-B, CISPR11-B, CISPR32-B, EN55011-B, and EN55032-B. Cosel offers EMI/EMC filters type EAC-03-472 for further noise reduction.</p>
      <p>The units have a 3,000VAC input to output isolation voltage, 2,000VAC input to ground and 500VAC output to ground.</p>
      <p>The units measure from 50x27x87.5mm in the 30W version to 62x27x155mm in the 100W version. They weigh between 100-250g.</p>
      <p>Additional options are available for specific applications, including a conformal coating for improved moisture resistance, lower leakage current (0.15mA max.), input and output EP connectors, or an output voltage potentiometer.</p>
      <p>Suggested applications include measurement and analysis equipment, machine tools and industrial robots, display equipment, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.</p>
      <p>The power supplies comply with the RoHS directive and are CE marked in accordance with the Low Voltage directive.</p>
