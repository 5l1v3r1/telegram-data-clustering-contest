        <b>Rohan Dennis split from Bahrain-Merida under a cloud, but the Australian is looking to a bright future after joining Team INEOS.</b>
      </p>
      <p>World time trial champion Rohan Dennis has signed for Team INEOS on a two-year deal.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who retained his time trial crown in Harrogate in September, described the move as “a dream”.</p>
      <p>It follows a falling out with his former employers Bahrain-Merida, who released Dennis from the final year of his contract after he abandoned the Tour de France following a reported row over his equipment.</p>
      <p>In moving to INEOS, Dennis will add to a line-up that already boasts multiple Grand Tour winner Chris Froome and this year’s Tour champion Egan Bernal, as well as last year’s victor Geraint Thomas.</p>
      <p>“This has been a dream of mine since turning professional,” the Australian told his new team’s website.</p>
      <p>“Watching on from afar, I’ve always been a huge fan of the team – ever since the early years. It’s always been a goal of mine to ride for this team, so to finally fulfil that dream is a brilliant feeling and a huge honour.</p>
      <p>“I already feel a connection to this team – a team that really believes in innovation, especially in time trialling, which is obviously something I’m hugely passionate about.</p>
      <p>“I hope I can do the team colours proud over the course of my time here.”</p>

      <p>Team principal Dave Brailsford welcomed the addition of a man with 28 race wins to his name, with a debut expected to come on home soil in 2020.</p>
      <p>“We all know what a world-class talent Rohan is,” said Brailsford.</p>
      <p>“He is one of the best and most exciting time trial riders in modern cycling and we are very pleased to have signed him at Team INEOS.”</p>
