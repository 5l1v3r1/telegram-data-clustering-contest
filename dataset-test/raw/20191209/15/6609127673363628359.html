      <p>Grezda, who represented himself at Glasgow Sheriff Court claimed he did not realise his insurance had lapsed because he had not checked his mail.</p>
      <p>He admitted driving without insurance and not having a valid licence and was fined £400.</p>
      <p>The court heard Grezda was banned from driving for six months in March this year, and should have applied for a new licence when the disqualification ended.</p>
      <p>Grezda told the court that he thought he had paid his insurance by direct debit and added: “I wasn’t aware that they had refunded the money back into my account.</p>

      <p>“They wanted information from my drivers licence but I didn’t reply as I didn’t see it.</p>
      <p>“I never saw the mail as I never checked the mail I was sure I had insurance.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Barry Divers asked if the insurance company could have been getting in touch because he had been disqualified, Grezda replied: “Maybe.”</p>
      <p>Grezda, of Glasgow's Kelvinside, told the court: “I wish to apologise to the court for this incident. I didn't intend to drive without insurance and I hope this will be taken into consideration.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Barry Divers ordered his licence to be endorsed with six penalty points.</p>
