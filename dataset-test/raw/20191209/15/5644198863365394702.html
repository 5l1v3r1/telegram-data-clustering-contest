      <p>Rugby Australia (RA) have backed embattled Chief Executive Raelene Castle to continue in the role in the wake of intense criticism over her handling of the Israel Folau case.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Rugby Australia (RA) have backed embattled Chief Executive Raelene Castle to continue in the role in the wake of intense criticism over her handling of the Israel Folau case.</p>
      <p>Former Wallabies fullback Folau settled his unfair dismissal case with RA and Super Rugby team the New South Wales Waratahs last week, bringing an end to a bitter dispute triggered by his controversial social media post.</p>

      <p>The settlement drew criticism from some quarters as a humiliating surrender by RA, but despite calls to resign Castle said the agreement was in the best interests of the game.</p>
      <p>"Raelene's position is not in question and the board is united behind the process undertaken with Israel Folau," RA Chairman Cameron Clyne said in a statement on Monday after the governing body's final board meeting of the year.</p>
      <p>Castle's position was further complicated by reports earlier this year that RA could end its two-decade relationship with Fox Sports when the current broadcast rights deal expires at the end of next season.</p>
      <p>Clyne, who will step down as chairman in March, said RA was still in talks with the pay TV provider over an extension.</p>
      <p>"We remain in dialogue with our long-term partner Fox Sports as we aim to deliver the strongest levels of coverage for all of our competitions over the next five-year cycle," he said.</p>
