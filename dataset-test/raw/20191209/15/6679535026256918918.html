      <p>Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, who visited the construction site of the Cochin Cancer Research Centre where the porch roof that was newly built had collapsed last Monday, said that it was a matter of serious lapses in procedures.</p>
      <p>Calling for investigation, he said he would be writing to the Chief Minister in this regard.</p>
      <p>The Congress leader also said that all projects under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board Fund needed to have proper investigation. The government should come clear on its stand in all these projects, he added.</p>
