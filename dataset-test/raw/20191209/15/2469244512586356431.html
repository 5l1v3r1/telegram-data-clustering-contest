      <p>The search for a man who remains "unaccounted for" after a huge fire in North Devon still cannot take place.</p>
      <p>Last Monday (December 2) we reported on a large blaze at a property in the Upcott area of Bideford which billowed smoke in to the air and could be seen for miles around.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, police and the fire service revealed there was a man still "unaccounted for" but that a search of the premises could not take place due to the structural state of the building.</p>
      <p>Today, a week on from the blaze, it is still not known when structural clearance will be granted so search teams can enter the premises.</p>
      <p>Fire, police and ambulance crews were called to the house in the early hours of last Monday morning.Â  They found the building well alight with smoke visible from miles around.</p>

      <p>In their latest statement issued last week, Devon and Cornwall Police said investigations into the incident were ongoing.</p>
      <p>They said: "Officers were called by the ambulance service to a fire at a property in Upcott, Bideford, at around 6.50am on Monday 2 December.</p>
      <p>"A male occupant is currently unaccounted for. His next of kin are aware.</p>
      <p>"Investigations are currently ongoing whilst a scene examination is carried out.</p>

      <p>"The incident is not believed to be suspicious at this time."</p>
      <p>Speaking to Devon Live on the day of the blaze, fire incident commander Graham Rook told Devon Live: "We got called in the early hours of the morning to a report of a domestic fire.</p>
      <p>"We sent two crews from Bideford and a crew from Torrington and Barnstaple, so four crews in total, as well as a water bowser to help us with water supplies.</p>
      <p>"When crews first attended they confirmed there was a well developed fire within the property which was affecting both floors.</p>
      <p>"I arrived 10 minutes after the first crews and can confirm the fire is on all floors and is coming through the roof as well.</p>
      <p>"At this stage unfortunately we still have one person that's unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>"We can't get access to the building at the moment because of stability issues, so we're awaiting a structural engineer to come in and give us some more information on where we can get access to at the moment."</p>
