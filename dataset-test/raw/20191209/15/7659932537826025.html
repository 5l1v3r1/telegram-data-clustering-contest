      <p>Israel edged closer to a third election within a year Monday as neither the embattled premier Benjamin Netanyahu nor his main rival appeared close to forming a government two days before a deadline.<br/><br/>Right-winger Netanyahu and former army general Benny Gantz, who leads the centrist Blue and White alliance, traded blame over the impasse ahead of Wednesday, the last opportunity to form a coalition and avoid fresh polls.<br/><br/>A new election would be a repeat of September's deadlocked vote, which in itself was a response to inconclusive April polls, and would further deepen the political turmoil in the Jewish state.<br/><br/>"We made offer after offer and got nothing. Nada," Netanyahu said Sunday at a conference organized by a conservative Israeli newspaper. "Blue and White did not budge a millimeter."<br/><br/>The two parties have been discussing forming a unity coalition but Gantz has rejected serving under Netanyahu, pointing to his indictment on a string of corruption charges.<br/><br/>"The prime minister must serve as an example to the public," Gantz said at a meeting of his faction Monday.<br/><br/>He called on Netanyahu to publicly drop a demand that he be immune from prosecution, saying doing so would open the door to a unity government and avoiding "costly and unnecessary elections".<br/><br/>Following the inconclusive elections in September, both Netanyahu and Gantz were given 28-day periods to try and negotiate a workable coalition in Israel's proportional political system.<br/><br/>Neither was able to get the support of more than half of the members of the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament.<br/><br/>- Down to the wire -<br/><br/>President Reuven Rivlin then turned to parliament in the hope of avoiding an unpopular election.<br/><br/>But the 21-day period he granted parliament to find a suitable candidate expires at 11:59 pm (2159 GMT) on Wednesday.<br/><br/>If nothing changes by then, new polls will be called for, most likely to be held in March.<br/><br/>Theoretically, any member of parliament could try and gain the necessary support, but Netanyahu and Gantz remain the only realistic contenders.<br/><br/>A last-minute deal could still be reached with the help of a kingmaker in a political system where such battles often go down to the wire.<br/><br/>Avigdor Lieberman, whose secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party has eight seats and holds the balance of power, could decide to throw his support behind either bloc.<br/><br/>He has so far refused to back either, accusing Gantz of being reliant on the support of Israel's Arab minority and Netanyahu of being at the whim of ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.<br/><br/>He prefers a unity government, but weeks of talks have faltered.<br/><br/>Most Israeli media Monday reported little movement in the negotiations, setting the stage for new elections.<br/><br/>- Internal challenge -<br/><br/>Netanyahu's political problems are intertwined with his legal woes -- Israel's attorney general last month indicted him for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.<br/><br/>He strongly denies the allegations and accuses the country's media, police and prosecution of a witch-hunt.<br/><br/>No date has yet been set for the beginning of the proceedings.<br/><br/>Under Israeli law Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving prime minister, can remain in office despite an indictment.<br/><br/>A new poll Monday by Israel's public broadcaster Kan found that Netanyahu's Likud and Blue and White would again be deadlocked if elections were held today.<br/><br/>But if they do take place, Netanyahu might face yet another battle -- this time over the leadership of Likud.<br/><br/>Gideon Saar, a rival within the party, has called for a primary vote before any new election, though no decision has been taken yet on the idea.<br/><br/>On Sunday, both Saar and Netanyahu spoke at a closed-door meeting of Likud's central committee attended by around 800 people.<br/><br/>According to sources at the meeting cited by Israeli press, Saar received a warm welcome from his supporters but shouts of "traitor" from Netanyahu backers.<br/><br/>Saar later posted a video on his Facebook page of supporters chanting his name at the event.<br/><br/>"The attempts to delegitimize and besmirch those who seek to run (against Netanyahu) are against the Likud's democratic spirit," he told the crowd.<br/><br/>"A democratic competition strengthens the movement."</p>
