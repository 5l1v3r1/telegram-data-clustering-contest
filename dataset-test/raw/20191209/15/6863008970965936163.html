      <p>Head of the Center for Political Conjuncture Alexei Chesnakov has said Ukraine and Russia will most likely hold another prisoner swap, which is planned in the "all for all" format by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>"The exchange of all agreed people on all agreed – yes, it is quite possible, according to this formula, by the end of the year, closer to Christmas," he said, according to Russian Interfax news agency.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke about the fact that the "all for all" prisoner swap might be discussed during the Normandy Four summit.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, the Kremlin said the negotiations on this issue were at the final stage, however, they called a different format – 250 per 100. Ukraine supposedly had to transfer 250 detainees from its side to Russia.</p>
