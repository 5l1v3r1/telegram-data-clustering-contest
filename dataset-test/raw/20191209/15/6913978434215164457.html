      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>RIYAHD — </b>US tennis star John Isner is hoping next week’s Diriyah Tennis Cup presented by Saudi Aramco will be the catalyst in inspiring Saudi Arabia’s first breakout tennis superstar, insisting that it’s “never too late” for committed players to make it to the top.<br/><br/>The big-serving American — ranked 19th in the world, and who will touch down in Saudi this next week — is “thrilled” to be one of the eight tennis stars competing in the first ever professional tournament to take place in the Kingdom.<br/><br/>With Vision 2030 already driving participation in tennis to its highest level yet across the country, the three-day, $3 million-prize-pool competition is aiming to take national interest in the sport to even greater heights, further inspiring young players.<br/><br/>To big-hitting Isner — who did not turn professional until he was 22 — that is the most exciting element of this weekend’s tennis, and he hopes the play will encourage fans of all ages to pick-up a racquet in pursuit of their dreams.<br/><br/>“It is never too late to play professional tennis,” said the 2018 Wimbledon semi-finalist, who has smashed more than 10,000 aces since he made it to the sport’s grandest stage.<br/><br/>“While there will always be some players who decide to turn pro at the younger ages of 14, 15, 16, the majority of players in my mind who succeed on Tour are the ones who have taken the time to develop their game through practice and have fully prepared themselves for the rigors of being a professional tennis player. I needed four years of college in order to be ready to play professional tennis and it’s something that when looking back on my past I wouldn't’ hesitate to do again.”<br/><br/>Asked what tips he would give to younger players dreaming of making the grade, Isner said: “Eat your vegetables! Practice hard throughout training and prepare for bumps in the road while you look to achieve your goals. Tennis is a sport where it’s integral to focus on what is going on in the moment and not thinking about what has occurred in your previous matches or what is ahead of you.”<br/><br/>Held on the outskirts of Riyadh, the three-day Diriyah Cup tournament will welcome eight leading ATP players from seven nations: Isner is joined by Stan Wawrinka (SWZ), David Goffin (BEL), Daniil Medvedev (RUS), Lucas Pouille (FRA), Fabio Fognini (ITA), Gael Monfils (France) and Jan-Lennard Struff (GER)<br/><br/>The Cup is one of several sporting spectacles taking place as part of the Kingdom’s 2019 Diriyah Season festival, which has already featured the Clash of the Dunes heavyweight boxing bout between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz.<br/><br/>Its 15,000-seater venue is set upon the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ad Diriyah, where the ancient mud-wall city will offer a breath-taking backdrop for three-days of hard-court tennis.<br/><br/>For Isner — who has won five career titles — it is an unmissable opportunity, both for the players and the fans.<br/><br/>He said: “I’m excited to really get a look at the culture and historical significance that Saudi Arabia has had on our world. Playing tennis at a world heritage site is really unique and I’m thrilled to be a part of it.<br/><br/>“It is thrilling to think that I am taking part in such a historical moment that will be a remembered in the sport of tennis for years to come. Tennis is always looking for new fans and opportunities to help grow the game and I believe that this event coming to Saudi Arabia is a great way to truly help impact and expand the game as we look to connect to new fans.<br/><br/>“December is a key part of the off-season training for many players as we gear up for the 2020 year and being able to play against some of the top players in the world while provide some world-class preparation for myself as I get ready for next year.”<br/><br/>He added: “The biggest thing when it comes to watching tennis live compared to watching it on TV is the overall atmosphere when you are sitting in the seats and watching the points. You have a different feel for every point and you truly feel part of the match itself as the fans watch what will for sure be some incredible points.”<br/><br/>The Diriyah Tennis Cup presented by Saudi Aramco will be the first time ATP stars have ever played professionally in Saudi Arabia, following recent similar events in the likes of neighboring Dubai and Abu Dhabi.<br/><br/>With 70% of the country’s 32 million population aged under-24, the Kingdom is aiming to diversify its health and recreation offering — as well as its education, infrastructure and tourism sectors — to meet the ambitious targets of Vision 2030, set in place by Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman.<br/><br/>The campaign has already brought results across the Kingdom, with 76% of under-15s becoming more active as a result. Exercise amongst people aged 15 and over has almost doubled in the last three years too.<br/><br/>“Tennis played at the level these players play at consistently, week-in-week-out, is a truly awe-inspiring sight to behold,” said Peter-Michael Reichel, co-chairman of Basel Sports Group, the tournament organizer.</p>
