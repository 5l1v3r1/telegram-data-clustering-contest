      <p>A Derby sweet shop has relocated, increased its line of <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/business">products and introduced longer opening hours</a>.</p>
      <p>The store, which first started trading at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/intu-derby">Intu Derby in September</a>, has seen some new improvements with a bigger and better menu, longer opening hours and a delivery service across Derby.</p>
      <p>You can now find Captain Flavours, which specialises in sweets from America and imaginative candy creations, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/alvaston">in Brighton Road, Alvaston</a>.</p>
      <p>Sweet-toothed shoppers can get their sugar fix late at night as the store's new opening hours are Thursday to Sunday, 1pm until 10pm.</p>
      <p>Dan Khalifa, owner of <a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/all-about/east-midlands">the business</a>, said from setting up on Instagram and turning his dreams into reality, he's since had an "amazing journey".</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old said: "From starting to sell American snacks and drinks via Instagram and delivering them around Derby to then opening my first shop in the city centre.</p>
      <p>"Now I've moved into a bigger and better shop. I couldn’t have done this without my followers and supporters continuously showing love."</p>

      <p>He bought stock and shared his colourful creations on his growing Instagram page, which now has over 5,000 followers.</p>
      <p>There are a plethora of sweet creations to explore and the store offers customers the opportunity to personalise their toppings.</p>

      <p>Dan added: "Business and entrepreneurship is all about taking risks to create opportunities with the hope of prospering and that’s exactly what I did.</p>
      <p>"I moved from the city centre because I took the opportunity to create something that would give my customers and the people of Derby an even better Captain Flavours experience. I now offer a more enhanced menu, easier accessibility, a delivery service and longer opening hours. <br/><br/>"But, most importantly, I’m making people happy with what I do and that’s what I love.</p>
      <p>"I want to thank the locals in Alvaston for giving me such a warm welcome into the community and I also want to thank the Derby Telegraph for giving me the opportunity to get my business and voice heard.<br/><br/>"The new location is 384 Brighton Road, DE24 8TF. Come down and explore your imagination.”</p>
