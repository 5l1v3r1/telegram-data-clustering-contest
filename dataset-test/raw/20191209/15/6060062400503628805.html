      <h1>The 2020s could be an apocalyptic decade for Wall Street as artificial intelligence takes over the most popular jobs in finance</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Jobs in banking and the financial services industries continued to be among the most popular occupations of 2019.</li>
        <li>Despite their popularity, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/value-of-ai-at-banks-to-reach-300-billion-but-jobs-at-risk-2019-4">report</a> predicts that 1.3 million bank workers will lose their jobs or be reassigned due to automation.</li>
        <li>Banks have already begun investing in artificial intelligence, and recognize the technology will displace workers.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Jobs in banking are some of the most sought after for job seekers — but plenty of roles may not be around much longer. </p>
      <p>Algorithms that model prices or build portfolios could wipe out 6 million high-paying jobs in finance, according to Cornell University professor Marcos Lopez de Prado. </p>
      <p>Lopez de Prado told the US House Committee on Financial Services that AI might not replace jobs entirely, but current finance employees aren't trained to work alongside new technology, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-06/robots-in-finance-could-wipe-out-some-of-its-highest-paying-jobs">Bloomberg reported</a>. </p>
      <p>Lopez de Prado's statement aligns with a 2019 report that revealed 1.3 million US finance jobs — particularly customer-service reps, financial managers, and compliance and loan officers — could disappear by 2030, according to a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/value-of-ai-at-banks-to-reach-300-billion-but-jobs-at-risk-2019-4">British insights firm IHS Markit</a>. Brookings, too, recently found <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-stem-education">white-collar employees in tech and finance are more susceptible to AI job loss</a> than social workers, teachers, or cooks.</p>
      <h3>How AI is set to disrupt the finance industry</h3>
      <p>Despite a year of scandals that entangled many of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/largest-banks-us-list">country's largest banks</a>, the desire to work at these companies remains high, according to a report by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amid-scandals-banks-defy-headlines-persist-among-top-us-devin/">LinkedIn</a>. Some of the more high-profile scandals include <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/danske-bank-scandal-federal-reserve-probes-deutsche-bank-2019-1">Deutsche Bank's</a> alleged involvement in a global money-laundering scheme and accusations against <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wells-fargo-ceo-tim-sloan-is-retiring-2019-3-1028068293">Wells Fargo's</a> auto-loan and mortgage practices.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase remain <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedins-most-popular-companies-alphabet-facebook-amazon-and-more-2019-4">five of the most popular places to work in 2019</a>. LinkedIn attributes the popularity to banks offering increasingly tech-focused jobs that attract <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/highest-paying-entry-level-jobs-in-tech-2019-4#2-product-manager-9">talented software engineers and developers</a> out of college.</p>
      <p>"The reality is that if somebody wants to learn finance and strategy, these banks are still the places to be trained and developed," Heather Hammond, co-head of the global banking and markets practice at Russell Reynolds Associates, told <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amid-scandals-banks-defy-headlines-persist-among-top-us-devin/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
      <p>Jobs in banking as a whole are some of the most expensive in the country. Starting analysts make $91,000 in base pay, while <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-salary-how-much-bankers-make-2018-7">managing directors can earn almost $1 million after bonuses</a>. In fact, the industry could add a whopping $512 billion in global revenue by 2020 with the use of intelligent automation, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-institutions-boost-revenue-with-automation-2018-7">according to a 2018 report from Capgemini</a>.</p>
      <h3>Major banks have already begun implementing AI</h3>
      <p>While the use of AI remains sparse, and the technology is still basic, a boost in revenue will increase the adoption of automation, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-institutions-boost-revenue-with-automation-2018-7">Business Insider analyst Lea Nonninger reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for job seekers, banks' investment into automation is well under way. In fact, a detailed 2018 report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-in-banking-and-payments-report-2018-2">Business Insider Intelligence</a> noted that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ai-in-banking-report-2019-6">banks are already using AI</a> to mimic bank employees, automate processes, and preempt problems. JPMorgan is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-streets-running-into-the-stark-reality-of-ai-2019-2">cleaning thousands of databases</a> to make room for machine learning tech. Citi president Jamie Forese said in 2018 that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-executive-warns-banking-jobs-automation-2018-6/">robots could replace as many as 10,000 human jobs</a> within five years.</p>
      <p>Laura Barrowman, chief technology officer at the Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse, revealed the company is already retraining employees whose jobs have been displaced by AI: "Globally, if you look at cyber skills, I think there is a deficit," Barrowman told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-suisse-tech-head-on-automation-2019-1">Business Insider's panel at the World Economic Forum earlier this year</a>. "There is such a shortage of skills, and you need people who have that capability."</p>
