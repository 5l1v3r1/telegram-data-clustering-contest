      <h1>Saudi gunman complained about nickname ‘Porn Stash’ given by Pensacola flight instructor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:27:12+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>The Saudi national who opened fire at a Navy base in Florida <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/us/pensacola-gunman.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">was <u>outraged</u></a> at his peers who slapped him with the nickname “Porn Stash.”</p>
      <p>Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, opened fire, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/man-who-shot-up-naval-air-station-pensacola-was-a-saudi-aviation-student">killing three and wounding seven</a>, at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. Alshamrani was named as the presumed terrorist on Friday, but he was known by a different name on the base: "Porn Stash."</p>
      <p>The accused terrorist sported a thick mustache similar to the facial hair of many adult film stars.</p>
      <p>Alshamrani was “infuriated” after a meteorology instructor, James Day, called him “Porn Stash” during class in front of nearly a dozen other students. The Saudi national filed a complaint with his superior officer about the public mockery.</p>
      <p>“I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class,” Alshamrani said in the complaint obtained by the<i> New York Times. </i>“Laughing, he continued to ask, ‘What? Have you not seen a porn star before? After I did not respond, he just let go of the subject.”</p>
      <p>The incident took place more than seven months ago, and the FBI does not believe the nickname was the basis for the shooting. Day’s employer noted that they had no updates related to the situation because it had been handled and closed in April. Day had offered to apologize to Alshamrani, but the gunman declined and requested to be reassigned to a different instructor, which he was.</p>
      <p>Authorities have presumed that the shooting as an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/defense-secretary-confirms-saudi-nationals-filmed-pensacola-shooting"><u>“act of terror”</u></a> and Saudi officials have been retracing Alshamrani’s steps to see if he had been radicalized <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/saudi-arabia-investigating-if-pensacola-shooter-was-radicalized-during-visit-to-middle-east"><u>during a visit</u></a> to the Middle East in February.</p>
