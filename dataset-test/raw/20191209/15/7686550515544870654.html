      <p>Police have said that two reported stabbings on City Road in less than a month are not linked.</p>
      <p>A man was taken to hospital on Friday with reported knife wounds after an incident on City Road, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> .</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has since been released from hospital after being treated for minor injuries.</p>
      <p>Armed officers were called to the area near Blue Honey Local and Express Imaging at 6.15pm on Friday following an alleged assault.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/south-wales-police">South Wales Police</a> said: "The nature of the man's injury suggested that the incident involved a weapon.</p>
      <p>"Inquiries are continuing to identify and arrest the suspect."</p>
      <p>It is understood that weapon was a blade.</p>
      <p>Police have confirmed they sent armed officers to the scene due to the "nature of a man's injuries".</p>

      <p>Witnesses <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/city-road-cardiff-police-closed-17379211">described seeing armed police at the scene ,</a> which was cordoned off by police officers from the Roath Park pub to the Royal George Pub for almost three hours.</p>
      <p>Seren Kitchener, who lives above a shop in City Road, said: “It’s a bit disconcerting but we made sure all the doors were locked.”</p>
      <p>Last week, police confirmed that <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/city-road-stabbing-cardiff-police-17368810">two teens had been arrested </a>after a 27-year-old man was allegedly stabbed on the street on Sunday, November 24.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said an 18-year-old from Tremorfa, and a 16-year-old from Trowbridge had been arrested and have been released under investigation.</p>
      <p>She added: "Understandably there is shock and worry within the community when an incident such as this happens.</p>
      <p>"Please be reassured that tackling knife crime is a priority for the force and we are seeing good results.</p>
      <p>"Families and communities can play their part in helping to tackle serious violence by taking responsibility for their children and young adults who are on the fringes of criminality or at risk of carrying a knife."</p>
      <p>An investigation has been launched and police are urging any witnesses with information to contact 101 giving reference 449759.</p>
