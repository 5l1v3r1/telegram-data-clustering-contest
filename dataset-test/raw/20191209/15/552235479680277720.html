      <p>A mini geyser was bubbling away on Dumbarton Common last week.</p>
      <p>Scottish Water fixed the burst water main which residents say resembled a small geyser and has left a huge hole in the grass.</p>
      <p>One resident told us on Friday: “There is a large hole in Dumbarton Common.</p>
      <p>“I first saw it at around 8am on Thursday morning. We hadn’t even had a lot of rain at that point.</p>
      <p>“Then at around 10am I was passing it and it was quite obviously bubbling up from under the ground.</p>
      <p>“It looked like a little geyser.</p>
      <p>“The water board were there at night. They had machinery and they were pumping water out.</p>
      <p>“The hole is still there and is surrounded by white and red barriers.</p>
      <p>“Before the railway was there, Dumbarton Common was part of the River Leven.</p>
      <p>“There must be pipes under there but they have obviously managed to plug it in some way.”</p>
      <p>A Scottish Water spokeswoman said: “We received a report of a bust water main in this area on Thursday, December 5.</p>
      <p>“Scottish Water operatives attended, isolated the burst on the nine-inch main and carried out a repair. This incident had no impact on customers’ water supply but did cause some localised flooding.”</p>
      <p>A West Dunbartonshire Council spokeswoman said: “Work to repair a burst water main at Dumbarton Common has been undertaken by Scottish Water.”</p>
