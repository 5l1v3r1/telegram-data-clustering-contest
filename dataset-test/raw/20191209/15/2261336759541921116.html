      <p>Although Colby Covington was going up against the No. 2 ranked welterweight in the world at the time of UFC Fight Night 119, the UFC had every intention of cutting ‘Chaos’ after the fight.</p>

      <p>That’s according to a recent interview with conservative political commentator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQRMxivohcI">Candace Owens</a>, where Covington revealed that his WWE-style post-fight promo literally saved his career. After dominating Demian Maia enroute to a unanimous decision at Sao Paulo’s Ginásio do Ibirapuera, Covington called the local crowd ‘filfthy animals’ and referred to Brazil as a ‘dump’.</p>

      <p>“I’ve never told this story before but three fights ago, before I fought the No. 2 guy in the world, this guy named Demian Maia, in Brazil, they had told my manager Dan Lambert that they weren’t going to re-sign me,” Covington said, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/12/9/21002178/colby-covington-claims-the-ufc-was-going-to-release-him-before-his-now-infamous-filthy-animals-promo">per MMA Fighting</a>. “They didn’t like my style, they didn’t like that I wasn’t entertaining, and this is before I really started to become an entertainer and really understand the entertainment aspect of this business. So before this fight they told me no matter what happens, I was ranked No. 6 in the world, ‘We’re not re-signing you. We don’t like your character. We don’t like your fighting style.’ And I’m getting paid $30,000 to go fight the No. 2 guy in the world. After you pay taxes and pay your coaches, you’re really going to get like, $5000 or $10,000.</p>
      <p>“So I go out there and I beat him up and leave him in a pool of blood in Sao Paulo, Brazil, his home city, and I shoot this promo on the Brazilians and I say, ‘You guys are all a bunch of filthy animals and Brazil you’re a dump.’... So I go and shoot this promo, and I wasn’t supposed to have my job, but that promo goes so viral on the internet, that the UFC’s like, ‘We have to keep him. We have to re-sign him because that promo is so big.’ So that’s what saved my career and that was the turning point of my career and the rest has been history.”</p>
      <p>Now fully embracing his role as the ‘bad guy’, 31-year-old Covington has no intentions of slowing down after he promises to beat Kamaru Usman to win the welterweight title at UFC 245.</p>
      <p>“When I’m on camera, I’m amping everything up to 110 because this is the show business, entertainment...” Covington said. “I’m entertaining. I’m putting on a show for the fans because that’s what they want to see. That’s what they pay their hard-earned money for, so I’ve got to give it to them.”</p>
      <p>UFC 245: Usman vs. Covington takes place this Saturday, Dec. 14 at T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas.</p>
