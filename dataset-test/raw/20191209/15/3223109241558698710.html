      <h1>Watch: What To Expect From ‘Doctor Who’ Season 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:25:46+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Only 23 more sleeps until the <i>Doctor Who</i> season premiere. But what can we expect from the new series?</p>
      <p>A lot of excitement, according to the show’s cast and crew.</p>
      <p>“It’s got action. It’s got scares. It’s got humor. It’s got warmth,” showrunner Chris Chibnall teased in a new video. “And it’s got the TARDIS.”</p>
      <p>What more could a geek want?</p>
      <p>Well, for starters, how about some more footage of the upcoming series.</p>
      <p>The new clip—featuring Chibnall, Jodie Whittaker, Tosin Cole, Mandip Gill, and Bradley Walsh—recycles content from <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/watch-bbc-drops-doctor-who-season-12-trailer-1811730/">last month’s trailer</a> mixed with talking-head extracts.</p>
      <p>“The season is about … the individual characters going on their own journey,” according to Whittaker. “And particularly for the Doctor, it’s a series about self discovery.” </p>
      <p>“It was exciting to revisit certain relationships,” she said, possibly alluding to the return of familiar adversaries like the Cybermen, Judoon, and Racnoss (or maybe just her traveling companions). “But also to have new ones as well.”</p>

      <p>Intended as a scare-the-pants-off-you children’s show, <i>Doctor Who</i> has serious, ponderous moments, too. And this season, as the titular Time Lord faces one of her greatest foes, audiences can expect some dark twists and turns.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to see the 13th Doctor really tested,” series producer Nikki Wilson said.</p>
      <p>Season 12 <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/watch-doctor-who-returns-with-two-part-new-years-special-1812519/">premieres on Wednesday, Jan. 1</a> at 8 p.m. on BBC America. Two-part special “Spyfall” features <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/stephen-fry-sir-lenny-henry-to-guest-star-in-doctor-who-season-opener-1811425/">guest stars Stephen Fry and Sir Lenny Henry</a> in what looks like a sensational start to a long-awaited series.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, the 10-episode adventure slides back into its regularly scheduled Sunday slot.</p>
      <p>“I think there’ll be lots of exciting things to come,” according to Whittaker.</p>
      <p>Trust her: She’s the Doctor.</p>
