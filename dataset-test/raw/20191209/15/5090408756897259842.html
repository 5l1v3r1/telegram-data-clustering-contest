      <h3>Pairing yellow walls and warm lighting was popular in the last decade, but it likely won’t be moving forward.</h3>

      <p>“Yellow interior paint combined with yellow temperature lighting needs to stay in this decade,” the team from <a href="https://transitionstate.com/">Transition State</a>, a Los Angeles-based design label, told Insider.</p>
      <p>“Since 2010, that style has evolved into a much lighter, airy feeling ranging from the weight of furniture pieces to the drapery and print,” Transition State said.</p>

      <h3>Painted floors were big in the 2010s, but experts don’t think they’ll continue to be in the next decade.</h3>

      <p>“I’m pretty sure that painted floors will not be returning,” Ashley Quinn, the vice president of creative marketing at <a href="http://www.imgnyc.com/">Interior Marketing Group</a>, told Insider of the trend.</p>

      <h3>Excessive greenery as decor will probably stay in the 2010s.</h3>

      <p>You probably won’t see homes with “an overwhelming amount of plants” in the 2020s, according to Transition State.</p>
      <p>While greenery will likely still be used as a decor piece, filling every corner of a home with plants probably won’t be commonplace again.</p>

      <h3>You’ll probably say goodbye to farm doors in the next decade.</h3>

      <p>While barn doors did make for a cute addition to a space, they’re likely not going to be popular moving forward.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/decorating-trends-to-avoid-2020-36651863">Apartment Therapy</a>, barn doors aren’t functional, making them unappealing to people.</p>

      <h3>The Transition State team also thinks using mason jars as decor won’t continue into the 2020s.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Mason jars entered the design sphere as an accent to the farmhouse aesthetic, particularly as wedding decor, but overuse of the trend has rendered them obsolete.</p>
      <p>“We’re ready to leave that behind,” the Transition State team said of the trend.</p>

      <h3>Millennial pink everything is out, and it will probably stay that way.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Though it seemed like it would last forever, the <a href="https://www.insider.com/millennial-pink-products-2017-4">millennial pink trend</a> is over, according to <a href="https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/trends/g9169186/outdated-home-decor-trends/?slide=7">Elle Decor</a>.</p>
      <p>Joe Berkowitz of <a href="http://jabinteriors.com/">Jab Design Group</a> told Insider that neutral colors like gray, beige, and white will win out over bright, trendy hues.</p>

      <h3>Accent walls definitely had a moment in the last decade, but that moment appears to be over.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>“What used to be known as a pop in a room now tends to make a space feel unfinished and underwhelming,” the Transition State team said of accent walls.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>But some experts think all design trends are destined to come back eventually.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>“Everything comes back eventually,” Berkowitz said. “I have been in this industry for 30 years and I have witnessed that firsthand.”</p>
      <p>For instance, wallpaper had a renaissance in the 2010s, which Berkowitz has loved. “The selection that has been made available to us is incredibly beautiful, varied, and creative.”</p>
