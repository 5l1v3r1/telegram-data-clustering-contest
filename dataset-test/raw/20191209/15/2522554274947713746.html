      <h1>Juice Wrld’s Security Guards Arrested for Having Guns at Airport: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:22:46+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/trentfitzgerald/" target="_blank">Trent Fitzgerald</a></address>
      <p>Two security guards with <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/juice-wrld/">Juice Wrld</a> were reportedly arrested at Chicago's Midway International Airport at the time of late rapper's <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/12/juice-wrld-dead/">untimely death</a> after an apparent seizure on Sunday (Dec. 8).</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/12/08/two-of-rapper-juice-wrlds-security-guards-arrested-for-having-guns-at-airport/"><i>New York Post</i></a> report published on Sunday, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that Juice arrived at the airport with a group of about 10 to 12 people, including his entourage, airplane personnel and the two security guards, Chris Long and Henry Dean. Although Long and Dean had a valid conceal and carry permit, that permit didn't authorize them to bring their firearms into an airport.</p>
      <p>Long, who is publicly recognized as Juice Wrld’s personal photographer and videographer, and Dean were arrested and charged with misdemeanor gun violations. Guglielmi added that both men were "very cooperative" during the investigation. Police didn't find any contraband on the other members of the group. Dean was later released without bail, while Long was also released, though he had to post a $1,500 bond.</p>
      <p>Juice, born name Jarad Higgins, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/12/juice-wrld-dead/">suffered from a seizure</a> after landing at Chicago's Midway Airport following a private flight from California. According to witnesses, the medical emergency occurred as the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/10/juice-wrld-interview-new-album/">Chicago rapper</a> was at the airport. The seizure reportedly caused him to bleed from the mouth. Paramedics rushed Juice to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., where he was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m. He was 21.</p>
      <p>An autopsy on the late rapper is scheduled for Monday (Dec. 9) at the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. Police said there were no signs of foul play.</p>
      <p>Juice Wrld's record label, Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, released a statement to <i>XXL</i> on the rapper's death.</p>
      <p>"Juice made a profound impact on the world in such a short period of time," the statement reads. "He was a gentle soul, whose creativity knew no bounds, an exceptional human being and artist who loved and cared for his fans above everything else. To lose someone so kind and so close to our hearts is devastating. Our thoughts are with Juice’s family and friends, everyone at his label Grade A, and his millions of fans around the world."</p>
      <p><i>XXL</i> has reached out to Juice Wrld's reps as well as the FBI for comment.</p>
