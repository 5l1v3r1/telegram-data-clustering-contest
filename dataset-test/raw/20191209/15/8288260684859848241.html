      <h1>Semi Ajayi describes West Brom star Matheus Pereira in one word</h1>
      <h2>West Brom news | Semi Ajayi, who scored the first goal in Albion's 5-1 win over Swansea City on Sunday, claims that Pereira is the best player in the Championship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:09:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Chapman, https://www.facebook.com/josephchapmanBM/</a></address>
      <p>Semi Ajayi says that watching Matheus Pereira is a 'joke’ as he claimed that the Brazilian is the best player in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Centre-back Ajayi, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-no-respect-anyone-17384927">who opened the scoring in Sunday’s 5-1 hammering of Swansea City</a> , watched Pereira work his magic at the other end of the pitch as he ran rings around the Swans and played a part in all five of the Baggies’ goals.</p>
      <p>The £1.5m summer signing from Rotherham United - a fee that by the weeks looks more and more of a bargain - netted his third goal of the campaign in that win, and is generally enjoying himself at The Hawthorns after striking up a flourishing partnership with Kyle Bartley.</p>

      <p>Pereira, though, is someone he enjoys watching just as much as playing alongside.</p>
      <p>“He’s a joke. It’s a joy to play with him, but I can imagine it’s even more of a joy to watch him,” Ajayi said. “Some of his passing against Swansea was unreal and long may it continue.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, definitely [best in the league]. From the performances he has put in it’s hard to argue otherwise. We’re all really pleased for him.</p>

      <p>“It’s a joy to be part of this team. Everyone is singing off the same hymn sheet and we have got a lot of talented players in the team.</p>
      <p>“I think everyone has got a really good understanding of what we want to do. It is a joy to play in this team, definitely.</p>
      <p>“It’s about keep the momentum going. We are taking things one game at a time. Our focus now switches to Wigan.</p>
      <p>“We will prepare for that and try to implement the game plan the manager wants. Hopefully we can do that and get another win.”</p>
      <p>It’s not just Pereira who has been excelling recently.</p>
      <p>Hal Robson-Kanu has been enjoying form that Albion fans have scarcely seen from him in the last couple of months; he’s netted six goals in his last nine matches and has been the focal point that Albion have been longing for at the front end of the pitch.</p>
      <p>“Hal is on absolute fire at the moment, too. We are all really, really happy for him,” Ajayi added.</p>
      <p>“He is getting the goals but more importantly his all-round play has been really good and that is allowing us to get up the pitch. I’m delighted for him.”</p>
