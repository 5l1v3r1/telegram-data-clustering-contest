      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kate-garraway-confesses-im-celeb-21055562">The Mirror</a> reports that Kate said the women in the camp were nervous and embarrassed by the prospect of having to shower in their bikinis in front of the nation.</p>
      <p>So much so that they all made a pact 'block off' the cameras for each other when they showered.</p>
      <aside>You think, 'I'm never going in that shower, it's too embarrassing.</aside>
      <p>"You think, 'I'm never going in that shower, it's too embarrassing'," she said.</p>
      <p>"But it is the only way to wash."</p>
      <p>It wasn't until that they realised that they were "really, really, really smelly" that the ladies of the camp decided to take a shower.</p>

      <p>Instead, Kate took inspiration from fellow campmate Caitlin Jenner.</p>
      <p>"You think 'if she's brave enough to shower then, you know, then we'll all get in'"</p>
      <p>"There's nowhere to hide," she added.</p>

      <p>During the series, it was reported that the female campmates - including Kate, Nadine Coyle and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jac-jossa-crowned-jungle-queen/">eventual winner Jacqueline Jossa</a> - had <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebritys-female-stars-refuse-to-do-a-myleene-and-are-reluctant-to-have-showers/">'refused to do a Myleene'</a>.</p>
      <p>Ex-contestant Myleene, 41, stripped down to her bikini in the 2006 series, which produced an iconic shower image.</p>
      <p>The Sun reported that they were 'reluctant to be seen showering'.</p>
