      <p>The Absa Premiership goalscoring chart has a new man on top after his hat-trick at the weekend. </p>
      <p>Samir Nurkovic’s three goals for Kaizer Chiefs in a 5-3 win over Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday evening, saw the Serbian being placed as one of the top goalscorers in the league. </p>

      <p>Nurkovic, Peter Shaluilile of Highlands Park and Knox Mutizwa of Golden Arrows all occupy the number one spot with eight goals each.</p>
      <p>After missing just two league fixtures for Chiefs due to a head injury, the 27-year-old returned to action with a bang, scoring seven goals in his last five appearances. </p>
      <p>However, following closely behind the Amakhosi marksman, is Cape Town City’s Kermit Erasmus and AmaZuluFC’s Bongi Ntuli on seven goals so far in the Absa Premiership, while SuperSport United’s Bradley Grobler and Orlando Pirates’ Tshegofatso Mabasa has scored six goals each.</p>
