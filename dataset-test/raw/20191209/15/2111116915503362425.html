      <p>If you're still looking for an Echo Dot deal to complete your smart home, you'll be happy to know you can pick up a smart speaker complete with a set of Philips Hue bulbs for a great price this week. This Echo Dot Philips Hue deal bundle was all the rage over Cyber week and is now back in stock at Amazon. You can get both a third generation Echo Dot smart speaker and two Philips Hue A19 smart bulbs for just $34 this week - that's less than the usual MSRP of either item on a normal day. </p>
      <p>You're essentially paying £17 for each of the items in this bundle, making this by far the cheapest we've ever seen them go for. The Echo Dot by itself is usually $49.99, making this an excellent saving just in time for the holidays. </p>
      <p>You're getting the standard third-generation Echo Dot everyone knows loves, with all its Alexa smart speaker goodness. But what's a smart home without bulbs? Two Philips Hue bulbs are also included in this deal. What's more, these particular A19 bulbs <b>don't require a hub to work</b>, meaning you don't have to shell out for that costly smart home brain to enjoy voice-controlled lighting. They link directly to Alexa through Bluetooth, leaving you with a stress-free and a reliable connection. </p>
