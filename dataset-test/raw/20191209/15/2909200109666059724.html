      <p>The Founder of Anointed Palace Chapel (APC) Francis Antwi, aka Reverend Obofour has threatened to expose officials of the Tema West Municipal Assembly who took some monies from him as bribes when they inspected progress of his church building in the area.</p>
      <p>“I will talk when you push me. Anyone who has collected money in connection with the construction of the building will have to vomit it when we get to the court,” he threatened</p>
      <p>A week ago, there was news that Adwoa Amoako, Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) of Tema West Assembly, escaped being physically attacked by some agitated members of APC after the MCE and her officers had visited the premises of the church to inspect building permits and also collect property rates.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the fracas that ensued on the premises of his church in Tema, Rev. Obofour called the TWMA official “liars” and rather accused them of attacking three of his security men on the church premises without any justification.</p>
      <p>He explained  in a 28-minute 17-seconds video on his YouTube channel <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> sighted that the allegations levelled against his church workers by the assembly were fabricated to cover their bad deeds at his church.</p>
      <p>“I want the government to know that we did not take the law into our hands but they rather assaulted three security men at the church,” the controversial pastor claimed despite so-called bloodstains in a video which has gone viral.</p>
      <p>“I am stating on authority that no well-built men assaulted anyone at my church. The person who said well-built men assaulted someone at my church is a liar, and those who do not understand can send me anywhere they want,” he declared.</p>
