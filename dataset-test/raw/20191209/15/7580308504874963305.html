      <h1>Jordan jails man over plot to attack Israel embassy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:22:40+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:22</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>A Jordanian court on Monday sentenced a man to eight years in prison for allegedly plotting to attack the Israeli embassy in Amman last year.</p>
      <p>The state security court ruled that Khaled Abu Raya “threatened to carry out terrorist acts”.</p>
      <p>According to the charge sheet, the 33-year-old Jordanian planned “to open fire on the embassy and its employees in a bid to kill a large number of Israelis”.</p>
      <p>The plot was alleged to be in response to the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed city of Jerusalem in May 2018, a major policy shift that outraged Palestinians and Arabs.</p>
      <p>According to the charge sheet, it was also motivated by Israel’s blockade of the impoverished Gaza Strip which has been rocked by anti-Israeli protests since March last year.</p>
      <p>The same court also sentenced another Jordanian, Munir Ibrahim, to three years in jail on Monday for allegedly planning to infiltrate Israel and attack soldiers in the Jewish state.</p>
      <p>Illegal crossings of the tightly secured border between Jordan and Israel are rare.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Jordan referred an Israeli to court on charges of illegally entering the kingdom and possessing drugs.</p>
      <p>Ties between the two countries, which are bound by a peace treaty, have been cool in recent years amid disagreements and issues linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
