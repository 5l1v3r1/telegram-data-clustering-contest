      <h2>Gavin Collins also spoke about a female voice which suggested good chess moves</h2>

      <p>A man accused of murdering a pensioner in a death crash told a psychiatrist he had "no memory of the actual killing".</p>
      <p>Gavin Collins had spoken with Dr Ramneesh Puri in HMP Manchester after Collins allegedly reversed into and killed 87-year-old Terry Radford, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/cctv-image-released-man-following-3568954">Mansfield Woodhouse</a>.</p>
      <p>Collins, 39, of Addison Street, Tibshelf, denies murder; two burglaries; aggravated vehicle taking, attempted robbery and kidnap.</p>
      <p>Jurors at his trial heard more about what he had told Dr Puri about events that day.</p>
      <p>Collins had checked Facebook and realised his son had not been on the social networking site for a year which worried him, Nottingham Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>"He said 'the voices' started saying 'that they had killed him'," said Dr Puri. "It was a female voice, which previously helped him with chess by suggesting good moves.</p>
      <p>"When I took his personal history, he mentioned from the age of seven or eight, he used to hear a female voice - which he said was quite helpful to suggest chess moves for him. He said they were good moves, because 'I used to win at chess'".</p>
      <p>Collins had said he needed to check on his son's welfare, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>The jury have heard how the day began with him allegedly taking a car and crashing into the corner of a house in Skegby.</p>
      <p>"I remember driving it, I remember crashing it", he had told Dr Puri.</p>
      <p>"He remembered talking to his dead brother and dad while he was driving," said Dr Puri. "He remembered he still wanted to get to Rainworth. He believed he was Jesus Christ. He said he got into some stranger's car.</p>
      <p>"He added he had no memory of the actual killing."</p>
      <p>The jury has heard how Collins got into a Seat Leon with the keys from a home he had just burgled and, says the prosecution, drove "quite deliberately and at speed" many metres straight into Mr Radford, forcing him backwards into a bus shelter and pinning him between the shelter and the Seat.</p>
      <p>The pensioner was badly injured and, despite the initial help of members of the public, followed by paramedics and, ultimately, a doctor from an air ambulance, he died at the scene.</p>
      <p>Collins was shouting things like "I've killed him", the jury has heard. He returned to the Seat and twice rammed a police car before driving off at high speed. The chase ended in a cul-de-sac, where he crashed into a front garden and police Tasered him.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/murder-accused-medication-stopped-prison-3618875">trial </a>continues.</p>
