      <p>It’s understood that a 13-year-old supporter was ejected from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for a ‘racist gesture’ directed at the South Korean.</p>
      <p>And Burnley insist that the incident is now "under investigation" by the Metropolitan Police and Lancashire Police, while the football club will be contacting the fan directly.</p>

      <p>A statement from the club read: “Burnley Football Club is aware of an incident during the Tottenham Hotspur v Burnley game on Saturday, December 7.</p>
      <p>“During the Premier League game, a 13-year-old Burnley supporter was ejected from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium following an alleged racist gesture towards Spurs player Heung-Min Son.</p>
      <p>“The minor, who was accompanied by a guardian, is now under investigation by the Metropolitan Police, with help from Lancashire Police and the two clubs.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime, Burnley Football Club will be contacting the teenager and his family, with a view to an enforced educational programme, run in conjunction with Kick It Out and Burnley FC in the Community.</p>
      <p>“Burnley Football Club would like to reiterate its zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination of any kind.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, a 41-year-old Manchester City fan was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of racist abuse during the Manchester derby.</p>
      <p>It’s understood that Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard and Fred were both abused during the 2-1 win for the Red Devils.</p>

      <p>The man in question - named as Anthony Burke - was seen making monkey chants in the stands.</p>
      <p>There were also multiple cases of homophobic abuse.</p>
      <p>Everton launched an investigation on Sunday into reports of homophobic chanting aimed at Chelsea fans during the Toffees' 3-1 victory at Goodison Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>While Brighton have announced that two visiting supporters were arrested on suspicion of homophobic abuse during Sunday's match with Wolves at the Amex Stadium.</p>
      <p>Two men, aged 46 and 48 from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, were ejected from the away section during the 2-2 draw and later arrested by Sussex Police outside the ground. They have since been released pending investigation.</p>
