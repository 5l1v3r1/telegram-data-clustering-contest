      <h2>The ex-treasurer of the Manchester City Former Players' Association passes away in his sleep a day after attending the Manchester derby</h2>

      <p>Former Manchester City player Roy Cheetham, who holds a unique place in the club’s history, has died, aged 79.</p>
      <p>A native of <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newton-heath">Newton Heath</a> , but born in <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/eccles">Eccles</a> , Roy was for many years the treasurer of City’s Former Players’ Association.</p>
      <p>He attended Saturday’s <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-derby">derby</a> , which <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">City</a> lost 2-1, and died in his sleep on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>That was poignant in itself, as one of his first City appearances was against United in September 1958 when, as an 18-year-old, he was up against Bobby Charlton.</p>
      <p>He said in a later interview: "I was still only 18 and there were about 63,000 at Maine Road, and here I was playing alongside my heroes Trautmann, Barnes, Hayes, Ewing and the others, against another team of heroes – Dennis Viollet and Bobby Charlton.</p>
      <p>"The game started and within the first few minutes I gave United a penalty – apparently I’d cut Bobby Charlton’s legs from under him! – and I thought this was it. I thought I’d never play again."</p>
      <p>But the wing half recovered to be named man of the match by some as the Blues fought back to a 1-1 draw.</p>
      <p>His claim to fame at City was that he was the first-ever Blues substitute. Subs were introduced in 1965, and on August 30, Mike Summerbee cut his head open after being dumped into the sidelines at Wolves.</p>
      <p>Cheetham took his place, one of 127 appearances he made for City in a 12-year career.</p>
      <p>He went on to play for Detroit Cougars, Charlton Athletic and Chester before winding up his career with a second spell in North America, at Windsor Stars, in 1972.</p>
      <p>He leaves behind a daughter, Nicola, and son Dean.</p>
