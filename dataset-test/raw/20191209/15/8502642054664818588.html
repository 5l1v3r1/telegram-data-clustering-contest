      <p>SAO PAULO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The number of cows slaughtered in Brazil after spending 90 days in feedlots is estimated to have grown by 2% to about 5.3 million head in 2019, a survey of Brazil's cattle market by Dutch animal nutrition company DSM showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>The figure will continue to grow as Brazilian ranchers seek more efficient ways to raise and finish livestock, DSM executives said at a media presentation, adding that an estimate for 2020 will be released in February.</p>
      <p>Strong demand for Brazilian beef, partially spurred by a rise in meat exports to China after a deadly pig disease disrupted supplies there, has boosted cattle prices in Brazil, becoming a driver for the feedlot model.</p>
      <p>"As cattle prices rise, the producer is encouraged to use more technology and put more animals in confinement," said Marcos Baruselli, DSM manager for feedlots businesses.</p>
      <p>DSM, which filed for Brazilian registration of a new feed additive for cows that can cut methane emissions by around 30%, is on track to launch it in the country by the end of next year, said Juliano Acedo, marketing director. (Reporting by Ana Mano; editing by Jonathan Oatis)</p>
