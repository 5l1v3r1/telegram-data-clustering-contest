      <p>The State High Court 1 in Yola, Adamawa State, has sentenced a fake medical doctor, Ibrahim Mustapha, to 54 years in jail.</p>
      <p>Justice Nathan Musa gave the ruling on Monday following an earlier plea of guilt by the accused.</p>
      <p>The judge said the court had considered the plea by the convict’s counsel for a mitigated sentence, and therefore sentenced him on the nine counts charge.</p>
      <p>He said, “On counts one to three, I sentence you to six months each with the option of fine of N20,000 to each.</p>
      <p>“On count eight, I sentence you to three years imprisonment with the option of N50,000 fine.</p>
      <p>“On counts four, five, six, seven and 10, I sentence you to 10 years of prison term on each of the counts without the option of a fine.”</p>
      <p>Justice Nathan added that all the terms will run concurrently. This means that he will spend 10 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>Mr Mustapha was arrested by the State Security Services in June this year for operating without valid papers.</p>
      <p>The state government accused him of responsibility for the death of dozens of patients, vowing to ensure he was brought to book to serve as a deterrent to others.</p>
      <p>During his parade by the SSS, Mr Mustapha had claimed that despite operating without valid documents, he never killed anybody.</p>
      <p>He said he had successfully carried out major and minor operations on dozens of patients since he began operation.</p>
