      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:35:39+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Skoulding</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> won <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> last night and then had to deal with a barrage of comments that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/dan-osborne-admits-smiling-hasnt-always-possible-amid-cheating-claims-jacqueline-jossa-heads-im-celebrity-finale-11412483/">her husband Dan Osborne has been unfaithful</a>.</p>
      <p>But the EastEnders actress is letting nothing ruin her queen of the jungle glory as she returned her wedding ring to her finger today to film I’m A Celebrity…Coming Out.</p>
      <p>The star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/im-celebrity-2019-winner-jacqueline-jossa-fine-dan-osborne-cheating-allegations-11481071/">cancelled all her TV interviews</a> on Monday after last night’s final amid accusations that her other half has cheated on her, but she has insisted on Instagram she’s doing ‘fine’.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline, 27, put the sparkling diamond right back on her ring finger to celebrate her 2019 win with all her co-stars after beating Coronation Street star Andy Whyment and DJ Roman Kemp in Sunday’s final.</p>
      <p>She was even seen <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/dan-osborne-jacqueline-jossa-cosy-im-celebrity-jungle-win-11413591/">smooching her other half Dan</a> in front of the hotel after leaving the jungle.</p>
      <p>‘Hello everybody. Thank you so much for voting for me. If you voted, it means the absolute world,’ she said on Instagram.</p>
      <p>‘I cannot quite believe it’s happening. I just want to let you all know, I am absolutely fine and it has been the best experience of my whole entire life and my babies are here.’</p>

      <p>It’s not all plain sailing for Jacqueline. It was claimed that she asked fellow contestant, Myles Stephenson, about her husband’s alleged infidelity while on the Australia-based reality show.</p>
      <p>In unaired scenes, Myles apparently told Jacqueline that he believed Dan, 28, had been involved with former Love Island contestant Gabby Allen, who is also Myles’ ex-girlfriend.</p>
      <p>The move apparently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/26/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-threatens-quit-phone-call-dan-osborne-cheating-allegations-unaired-scenes-11218991/">nearly caused Jacqueline to quit I’m A Celeb for good</a>.</p>
      <p>Since Jacqueline’s jungle exit, model Chloe Ayling has also accused Dan of being unfaithful, saying she and fellow Celebrity Big Brother star Natalie Nunn had a threesome with him a year after he married Jacqueline.</p>

      <p>But Dan has denied all claims of infidelity.</p>
      <p>He’s blasted reports that he had a fling with Gabby, as has Gabby herself.</p>

      <p>Dan, a former Towie star, has also completely denied the threesome that he’s been accused of.</p>
      <p>A rep for Dan told Metro.co.uk: ‘This story is not true and Dan will be seeking legal advice.’</p>
      <p>And now Jacqueline has chosen to focus on her win as she was pictured enjoying a glass of champagne and proudly wearing a flower crown at the Palazzo Versace hotel in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>While the actress is the first-ever winner in the show’s 17 years to cancel all TV interviews, an I’m A Celebrity spokesperson told the MailOnline Jac wants to ‘spend as much time as possible with her family in Oz before they have to travel back to the UK. Plus she’s filming Coming Out’.</p>
