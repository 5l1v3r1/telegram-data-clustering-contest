      <h1>World's first skincare brand using artificial intelligence arrives in Ireland</h1>
      <h2>Specific ingredients are selected to offer products optimally designed for the skin</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:28:44+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/sam-roberts/" target="_blank">Sam Roberts</a></address>
      <p>The world's first skincare brand to use artificial intelligence is coming to Ireland.</p>
      <p>Skinmade is a German company that uses advanced technology and artificial intelligence to measure and understand the skin's individual needs.</p>
      <p>Specific ingredients are then selected to offer products optimally designed for the skin.</p>
      <p>Skinmade founder Dr. Lars Rüther said: “Originally we were working with this technology in the Fraunhofer-Institute in Germany, when we realised the potential to use this intelligence for personalised skincare.</p>

      <p>"Today we are absolutely at the forefront of this capability within the worldwide skincare industry.</p>
      <p>"One day we will all look back and think it is crazy that we all used to use the same generic skincare products as each other, instead of having individual products that are designed specifically for us, by our own skin. Products that are Skinmade.”</p>
      <p>Customers can book a Skinmade reading at Akina Beauty Clinic on Leeson Street in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The moisturiser is available now from the clinic and www.akina.ie costing €55.</p>
