The <i>Cuz I Love You </i>singer paid a visit to Southern University to perform with the school's talented band that backed her production for her to sing her confidence bosting track. "If he don't love you anymore / Just walk your fine ass out the door," Lizzo preaches</p>

"This is a special moment for me... Good As Hell took a trip to Baton Rouge and was blessed by @su_humanjukebox and the dancing dolls at Southern University," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B53L0gLhAoh/">she captioned a clip on Instagram.</a></p>
