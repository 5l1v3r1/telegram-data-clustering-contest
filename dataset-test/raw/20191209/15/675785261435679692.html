      <h2>Lovehoney has launched a new ‘Design A Sex Toy’ competition with a prize of £5,000, as well as the chance to earn royalties on your product</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:16:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sex-toys">Sex toys</a> are often seen as taboo, but if you’re not too prudish about the devices you could get paid to design one.</p>
      <p>Lovehoney has launched a new <a href="https://www.lovehoney.com/design-a-sex-toy/">‘Design A Sex Toy’ competition</a> with a prize of £5,000, as well as the chance to earn royalties on your product.</p>
      <p>The sex toy firm is accepting toy designs for penises, prostates, vulvas, solo play and couples, although the design must have a ‘sci-fi’ theme.</p>
      <p>Lovehoney said: “Can you transport your imagination ten years down the road and give us a design that will help shape the future of sex?</p>
      <p>“If so, you could be in with a chance of bagging a 5,000 cash prize in your local currency. And that’s not all.</p>

      <p>“The winning design has a chance of being made into an actual product, which will go on sale on the Lovehoney website, and could earn you hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties!”</p>
      <p>These royalties can really add up over the years. According to Lovehoney, the winner of the 2009 competition has earned over £300,000 in royalties for his oral sex toy!</p>
      <p>The competition has three categories - Students, Professional Designers and the Public - although the prize money is the same for each category.</p>
      <p>The competition is open now and closes on February 21.</p>
      <p>The competition comes shortly after another sex toy company penned an open letter to the Department of Health, urging the NHS to prescribe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sexual-health">masturbation</a> to stressed patients.</p>
      <p>Kate Moyle, a sex therapist at LELO UK, said: “The function of pleasure is to make us feel good; and self-pleasure and masturbation can have positive benefits for our health in a variety of ways, including the release of the hormone oxytocin which can lower cortisol levels, getting to know our bodies better, and building sexual self-confidence.</p>
      <p>“Potentially recommended as a part of an integrated wellness programme, masturbation could be of benefit to some patients, when put forward with confidence and educative information.”</p>
