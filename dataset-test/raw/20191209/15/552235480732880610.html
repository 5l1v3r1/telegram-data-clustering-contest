      <h1>Awards recognition for Hope for Autism sports coach</h1>
      <h2>Majella Kerr was named disability coach of the year by sportscotland for her work with young people at the Airdrie charity.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:18:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:18</time> by <a rel="author">Judith Tonner, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/judith-tonner/</a></address>
      <p>A sports coach with an Airdrie-based charity has earned a prestigious national honour in recognition of “the life-changing impact she has on young people”.</p>
      <p>Majella Kerr was named disability coach of the year at the sportscotland coaching, officiating and volunteering awards in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>She works tirelessly with young people with autism from across North Lanarkshire, running a huge range of sessions including football, swimming, trampolining, cycling, yoga, karate and fitness.</p>
      <p>Her achievements include learning Makaton sign language and the picture exchange communication system to communicate with youngsters who cannot speak; and running a two-year balanceability class which saw more than 90 per cent of its participants learn to ride a bike despite the co-ordination difficulties this can pose for people with autism – described as “exceptionally challenging”.</p>
      <p>Majella has been coaching for six years, and was praised by both judges and colleagues at the Chapel Street organisation for her “enthusiasm, patience and dedication, all of which have made a lifelong difference to the children and families she works with”.</p>
      <p>She said: “Hope for Autism exists to give young people with autism the opportunities to get involved in sport that, unfortunately, they don’t always get elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“It’s honestly the best feeling to see someone come in and take part, whether that’s for five minutes or the full session – it should all be celebrated.</p>
      <p>“Just to get there takes a lot for the children and their family, so to see them enjoy it is absolutely brilliant and makes you want to do more and help get more coaches and volunteers in so that even more children can benefit; the sessions are great fun and are always geared around something that the young people want to learn or try.”</p>
      <p>Majella was among 15 “inspirational” sporting stars from across Scotland who were honoured at the ceremony.</p>
      <p>Her award was named in honour of renowned coach Janice Eaglesham, the chair of Scottish Disability Sport and co-founder of Red Star athletics club, who sadly died earlier this year.</p>
      <p>A short film about her saw nominator John Bruin praise “her enthusiasm for the job and the fact she can see potential in all the young people she works with”; while Gartcairn Hope FC coach John Graham added: “She’s a more than worthy winner and a great person – she’s just amazing and the kids love her”.</p>
      <p>Sportscotland chief executive Stewart Harris said: “Thousands of dedicated sporting enthusiasts devote their time, knowledge and skills to afford others the chance to take part in and experience all the benefits that come with sport participation.</p>
      <p>“These awards give us a chance to celebrate the great sporting achievements that are taking place every day and congratulate those who are making an incredible commitment to Scottish sport.”</p>
