      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:47:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/367421-buhari-travels-to-egypt-tuesday.html" target="_blank">Press Release</a></address>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari will depart Abuja Tuesday for Aswan, Egypt, to attend the <a href="https://www.aswanforum.org/">Aswan Forum</a> designed to set “An Agenda for Sustainable Peace and Development in Africa.”</p>
      <p>The Forum which holds December 11-12 2019 is an initiative to address the interconnections between peace and development in Africa, while promoting Africa-led solutions through strengthening policies and practices.</p>
      <p>The initiative is being launched by the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in his capacity as the Chairman of the African Union (AU) and as an advocate of Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development in Africa – a recurring theme of his tenure as the AU Chairman. It is also grounded in the AU’s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and the search for African solutions to African problems.</p>
      <p>The gathering is expected to bring together heads of state and government, leaders from regional and international organisations, financial institutions, private sector and civil societies as well as scholars, visionaries and prominent experts for action-oriented discussions on the threats, challenges and opportunities.</p>
      <p>It is also expected to end with a Declaration on the theme of the Forum and become an annual event.</p>

      <p>The President will be accompanied by Governors Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa, Godwin Obaseki of Edo and Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State.</p>
