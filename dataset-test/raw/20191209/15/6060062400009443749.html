      <p>At long last, the highly anticipated collaboration between Beyoncé and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/adidas">Adidas</a> is (almost) here. </p>
      <p>On Monday morning, the star shared a series of images on Instagram teasing her upcoming Ivy Park collection, along with an official release date of January 18. The creative partnership was first announced in April, through <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beyonce-adidas-collaboration-could-win-over-women-2019-4">several viral posts</a> that showed the singer clad in an Adidas bodysuit and laying atop a sea of sneakers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beyonce-posts-adidas-collaboration-photos-2019-4">Beyoncé was tapped</a> to help design new footwear and apparel as Adidas continues to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beyonce-adidas-collaboration-could-win-over-women-2019-4">build out its women's category</a> and appeal to female shoppers. The partnership also serves as the catalyst for the singer to relaunch Ivy Park, the athleisure company she co-created and is now the sole owner of after buying out <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/topshop-billionaire-owner-philip-green-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-2018-10">Topshop billionaire Phillip Green</a> in November 2018. </p>
      <p>"I took a chance on myself when I bought my company back," Beyoncé told <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29999871/beyonce-ivy-park-adidas-interview/">Elle in an interview published Monday</a>. "We all have the confidence in us to take chances and bet on ourselves."</p>
      <p>Beyond her obvious star power, bringing Beyoncé's legions of fans and social media followers — including 135 million on just Instagram alone — is a major boost for a company like Adidas. While the athletic retailer has worked with several celebrities and notable figures in the past, including Karlie Kloss, Pharrell Williams, and Stella McCartney, Beyoncé brings a new caliber of social media reach for the brand. </p>
      <p>A photo of Beyonce clad in a maroon Ivy Park bodysuit had already amassed more than 2.5 million likes in less than two hours on Monday. </p>

      <p>Adidas did not immediately return Business Insider's request for additional comment. </p>
      <p>The early images depict several pieces of gold jewelry as well as a pair of leather sneakers. </p>

      <p>As for the rest, we'll have to wait until January 18. In the meantime, Beyoncé <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29999871/beyonce-ivy-park-adidas-interview/">told Elle</a> to look forward to pieces for both men and women alike. </p>
      <p>"This new line is fun and lends itself to creativity, the ultimate power," she said. "I focused on designing a unisex collection of footwear and apparel because I saw so many men in Ivy Park. The way they have embraced the brand is an unexpected gift. I appreciate the beauty of gender-neutral clothing and breaking the so-called fashion rules."</p>
