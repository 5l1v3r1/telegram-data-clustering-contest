      <p>HONOLULU - While a taste for its flavors may continue, a Hawaii ice cream company is facing a serious decrease in business after a partner firm declared bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Dave’s Ice Cream Inc. may reduce its supply after last month’s bankruptcy of national food and beverage firm Dean Foods.</p>
      <p>Owner Dave Leong says it sells around 15,000 gallons of ice cream to Hawaii restaurants through a wholesale arrangement with Dean Foods subsidiary Meadow Gold Dairies-Hawaii.</p>
      <p>Leong says Meadow Gold plans to import ice cream from a Utah plant. That will cut his sales by more than $1 million annually.</p>
