      <p>The LSU Tigers are coming off a decisive SEC Championship victory over Georgia and now head into the College Football Playoff as the No. 1 team in the nation. But before their Peach Bowl tilt with Oklahoma, they have some time to chill and enjoy the fruits of their labor.</p>
      <p>For starters, they get to go back to Baton Rouge and celebrate with their newly-minted SEC title. And it looks like they’ll have their chance to party soon.</p>
      <p>A photo from the LSU facilities shows that the SEC Championship trophy has been delivered to the school.</p>
      <p>The trophy depicts a trio of football players battle in the trenches.At the bottom of the trophy are the words, “Louisiana State University: 2019 Champion.”</p>

      <p>The Tigers are 13-0 for the first time since 2011 thanks in part to a Heisman-caliber season from quarterback Joe Burrow. LSU’s signal caller is breaking just about LSU single-season passing record and SEC passing record.</p>
      <p>Burrow had 349 yards and four touchdowns in Saturday’s 37-10 win over the Bulldogs. He broke the SEC single-season touchdown record in the process.</p>
      <p>LSU now heads into late-December as winners of their last 14 games and boasting one of the best offenses in the nation.</p>
      <p>Let the celebrations commence!</p>
