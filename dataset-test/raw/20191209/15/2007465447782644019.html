      <h1>Php 61 million gets you this special Nissan GT-R50 by Italdesign</h1>
      <h2>2020 Nissan GT-R 50 goes from concept to production</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:36:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>Nissan isn't slowing down on the 50th anniversary celebrations of their halo sports car, the GT-R. After unveiling the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/php-63-million-could-buy-you-a-nissan-gt-r50-by-italdesign.html">GT-R 50 concept</a> by Italdesign earlier this year, they have made the production model official. Much like before, only 50 will be built.</p>

      <p>Just about every panel of the high-performance coupe was changed by the Italian design house. From the bumpers, fenders, doors, and quarter panels, no part was left untouched when Italdesign got their hands on it. The headlights, for instance, are totally different from the GT-Rs you see in showrooms, and the front end, and the grill is much wider than the standard model. Despite the changes, it's still recognizable as a GT-R from the front.</p>

      <p>The same goes for its flanks. Italdesign changed just enough for the GT-R to look more aggressive than usual. Its roof line is more sloped than the standard GT-R, but retains the look of the sports car thanks to the blacked out pillars and squared-off rear windows. As for the rear, that's where the most dramatic changes are seen. The rear windshield, trunk lid, and fascia were given a retro-futuristic look, and it's capped off by the active rear spoiler.</p>

      <p>Inside, it gets a unique dashboard with Alcantara laid down on the top part and embellished in carbon fiber at the center. The infotainment is unique to this model, as well as the door panels and the deeper bucket seats.</p>
      <p>But it's not just a cosmetic upgrade either. Powering the GT-R 50 is the same 3.8-liter, twin-turbo V6 that's been under the hood of this car for quite some time already, but that's where the similarities end. This one gets much more power, rated at a whopping 720 PS and a staggering 780 Nm of torque. Keeping that power on the road is a re-tuned all-wheel drive system to handle the extra power.</p>
      <p>Want one? You still have a chance. Surprisingly, there are still stocks of it left but it won't exactly be the most affordable GT-R out there. This one will set you back a cool $ 1.2 million, which is about Php 61,000,000 at current conversion rates.</p>
