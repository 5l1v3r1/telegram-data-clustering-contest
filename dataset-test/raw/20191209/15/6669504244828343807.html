      <p>The Tony Award winning musical <i>Chicago</i> is coming to Penticton for two shows on Saturday, March 28, 2020 with a matinee performance at 2 p.m. and an evening show at 7:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The hit musical is the recipient of six Tony Awards, two Olivier awards and a Grammy.</p>
      <p>The universal tale of fame, fortune and all that jazz has everything that makes Broadway great including show-stopping songs and some astonishing dancing.</p>
      <p><i>Chicago</i> is the story of Roxie Hart, a housewife and nightclub dancer in the 1920s who murders her on-the-side lover after he threatens to walk out on her. She hires Chicago’s slickest criminal lawyer to transform her crime into a barrage of sensational headlines.</p>
