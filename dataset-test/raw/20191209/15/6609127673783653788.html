      <p>And the local council told The Scottish Sun the situation will be reviewed to decide whether the youngsters will return to school as normal on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The school said that the situation was “highly unusual” and thanked the local community for their support.</p>
      <p>They told kids that they will still be able to access classwork via their Chromebooks, and said staff will give them work “where possible”.</p>
      <p>Nairn Academy wrote on Facebook: “Following the decision to close the school to S1 – S3 pupils today as a result of 15 staff absences through illness we regret to confirm that the school will remain closed tomorrow to S1 – S3 pupils as indications suggest we will be similarly short-staffed.</p>
      <p>“S1 – S3 pupils should be able to access classwork through their Chromebooks and, where possible, staff will post additional subject work for completion.</p>
      <p>"We very much appreciate that this situation is highly unusual and appreciate the support of the community.</p>
      <p>“We will provide further updates tomorrow through Facebook, blog, school closure line and Highland Council School Closure website.”</p>
      <p>The statement on social media was echoed by Highland Council.</p>
      <p>The school first confirmed the decision to send some kids home this morning due to the “unprecedented” number of absences.</p>
      <p>Parents were urged to contact the school if their child could not return home immediately - as they attempted to arrange transport for rural pupils.</p>
      <p>They wrote: “Due to unprecedented staff absences through illness we will be sending S1-S3 pupils home at the end of period 1 (9.45).</p>
      <p>“If your child needs to remain in school please contact the school office as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“We are currently looking with Stagecoach to arrange uplift of rural pupils.”</p>
