      <p>This is the wheel spinning moment a tractor loses a tyre and grinds along a road on its sparking axle, wiping out a passing car in the process.</p>
      <p>The terrifying incident took place in Belgorod, southern <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/russia/index.html"><b>Russia</b></a>, at 3.50pm last Thursday as the tractor navigated icy roads at a moderate speed.</p>
      <p>A car can be seen overtaking the tractor along a quiet road while another, recording via dash cam, follows closely behind at around 20 mph.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Moments later, in a bout of incredibly bad timing, a car passes the tractor from the opposite direction just as the tractor's wheel breaks free from the axle. </p>
      <p>The wheel is thrown across the road and smashes into the windscreen of the passing car, causing it to skid to a stop.  </p>
      <p>Without a wheel the tractor's axle creates sparks as it grinds along the road eventually coming to a standstill as its shocked driver looks over his shoulder. </p>
      <p>Although the car sustained significant damage incredibly the driver walked away unscathed. </p>

        <figcaption>Unluckily a car happened to be passing by on the quiet road, smashing into the heavy tractor wheel</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The incident took place at 3.50pm last Thursday. </p>
      <p>A witness driving the car behind said: 'The rear wheel of the tractor broke away as a car was driving past.</p>
      <p>'The driver didn't have a chance to react and collided with the heavy wheel. </p>
      <p>'The car was badly damaged, however, the driver was luckily not injured.' </p>
