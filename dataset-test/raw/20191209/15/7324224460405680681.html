      <p>Boris Johnson has said he is “looking at” abolishing the BBC licence fee.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said that while the Tories were currently “not planning to get rid of all TV licence fees”, the current system “bears reflection”.</p>
      <p>After being asked whether he would abolish TV licences altogether, Mr Johnson replied: “Well, I don’t think at this late stage in the campaign I’m going to make an unfunded spending commitment like that, but what I certainly think is that the BBC should cough up and pay for the licences for the over-75s as they promised to do.</p>
      <p>“But at this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licence fees, though I am certainly looking at it.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson added that the question of whether the funding format for public service broadcasters “still makes sense” needs to be asked.</p>
      <p>He said: “But you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV, a media organisation still makes sense in the long-term given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves – that’s all I will say.</p>
      <p>“I think that the system of funding by what is effectively a general tax, isn’t it, everybody has a TV, it bears reflection – let me put it that way.</p>
      <p>“How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels – that is the question.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson later told reporters the BBC “is not going to be privatised” while also outlining how decriminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee was under consideration.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’re looking at what we can do, the possibility of decriminalising, it’s part of the options to be considered.”</p>
      <p>In their manifesto, the Conservatives said they “recognise the value of free TV licences for over-75s and believe they should be funded by the BBC”.</p>
      <p>They have also pledged to “keep other pensioner benefits” which ensure older people have the security and dignity they deserve.</p>

      <p>Labour have promised to keep free TV licences for over-75s if they win power in the upcoming election.</p>
      <p>Both the BBC and the Government have been criticised over the announcement in June that free licences to all people aged over 75 were being scrapped.</p>
      <p>In response to Mr Johnson’s comments, shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary Tom Watson said: “This is a pathetic attempt by Boris Johnson to distract from his refusal to even look at the picture of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on a hospital floor.</p>
      <p>“We already know that Boris Johnson is a danger to our NHS.</p>
      <p>“His comments today reveal that he will threaten the very existence of another of Britain’s great institutions, the BBC, by scrapping its funding mechanism.</p>
      <p>“This is on top of the cruel decision to strip over-75s of their free TV licences.</p>
      <p>“An extreme Johnson government will damage everything that is good about this country. The only way to stop that is to vote Labour on Thursday.”</p>
      <p>A BBC spokesman said: “As we’ve said before, the licence fee ensures a universal BBC which serves everyone, is the most popular funding system among the public and is agreed as the method of funding the BBC for another eight years.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson’s relationship with broadcasters has been tested during the election campaign.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the campaign, a Conservative source suggested the party may review Channel 4’s public service broadcasting position after it replaced the Prime Minister with an ice sculpture when he refused to take part in a climate change debate.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson insisted he wanted an “unbridled” media after Labour accused the Tories of wanting to “restrict the free press” by threatening Channel 4.</p>
      <p>The party also made a formal complaint to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom’s election committee over what it said was “a provocative partisan stunt, which would itself constitute making a political opinion in its own right”.</p>
      <p>Ofcom decided that Channel 4 did not breach impartiality rules and decided not to investigate the complaint.</p>
      <p>Last week, the BBC’s broadcasting veteran Andrew Neil issued a direct challenge to the Prime Minister at the end of his fourth party leader interview to take part in a sit-down interview with him before Thursday’s election.</p>
      <p>Sam Packer, media campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which has led the Axe The TV Tax campaign to scrap the licence fee, said: “Boris is right to see the way the wind is blowing and look at axing the TV tax.</p>
      <p>“The licence fee is a hangover from a past media age, before the advent of streaming services and catch-up telly. It’s high time that politicians acknowledged the problems in the system and put a stop to this annual poll tax, bringing the BBC model into the 21st century.”</p>
