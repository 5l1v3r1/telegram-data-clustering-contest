      <h1>Florida city issues summons for 7-year-old parking violation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:23:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Gearty</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida">Florida city</a> mailed a summons to a vehicle owner seeking payment for a parking violation that was seven years old.</p>
      <p>Joe Reeser says he knew nothing about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/coast-guard-rescues-florida-dog-swimming-for-its-life">City of Tampa</a> $40 ticket from 2012 but paid it anyway after being told that his name had been flagged in a parking system review to identify unpaid tickets, WFLA-TV reports.</p>
      <p>“The policy is wrong,” he told the station. “I don’t know how many other people they’re dinging on this, but the whole thing is wrong.”</p>
      <p>Tampa doesn’t have a statute of limitations on old tickets, WFLA said.</p>

      <p>City officials claimed some old violations fell through the cracks in a change from a manual system to an automated one in 2012 — around the time of Reeser’s ticket.</p>
      <p>Tampa is now mailing out the outstanding years-old summonses with a demand to pay up, the station reported.</p>
      <p>Reeser is still angry.</p>

      <p>“You just shouldn’t -- seven years you’re going back and what’s to say that tomorrow they don’t send me something from 15 years ago,” he told the station. “It’s just ridiculous in my opinion.”</p>
      <p>City officials said Reeser was ticketed for a violation at the William F. Poe parking garage in downtown Tampa on Aug. 16, 2012, WFLA reported.</p>
      <p>The officials said the original summons had been sent to Reeser’s finance company because his vehicle was a lease.</p>
      <p>Reese said if that’s true, the finance company never sent him the summons.</p>

      <p>“I’ve never heard of this before now,” he told the station. “And now, so much time has passed, there is no recourse, no proof either way.”</p>
