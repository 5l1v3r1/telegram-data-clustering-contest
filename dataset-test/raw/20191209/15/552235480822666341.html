      <h2>Elf, It's A Wonderful Life and Die Hard will all be shown at Sir John Wilson town hall this month.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:57:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Bunting, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ian-bunting/</a></address>
      <p>Explosions, nightmares and burglars coming under attack aren’t things you traditionally associate with Christmas.</p>
      <p>But don’t worry, it’s all part of the fantastic festive fare set to hit the big screen at Airdrie town hall cinema over the next couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>Kicking things off this Friday (December 13) will be a double bill consisting of Tim Burton’s animated favourite The Nightmare Before Christmas at 6.30pm, and Bruce Willis at his best in seminal actioner Die Hard, at 8.30pm.</p>
      <p>A triple screening with three of the finest Christmas flicks on offer then follows on Sunday, December 22.</p>
      <p>It begins with family favourite Home Alone at 12 noon, continues with Will Ferrell having a ball in Elf at 3pm before classic tear-jerker It’s a Wonderful Life concludes the movie magic at 7pm.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the cinema said: “Movie fans can enjoy family festive films on the big screen, with a relaxed setting and licensed bar also available.</p>
      <p>“Both kids and adults can stretch their legs or enjoy refreshments without fear of being shushed!”</p>
      <p>To book tickets for any of the screenings, call 01698 403120 or visit culturenl.co.uk.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the cinema will also host a showing of a majestic opera early next year when La Bohème comes to town.</p>
      <p>Exploring themes of love, loss and the fight for survival, Puccini’s story of young love in 19C Paris is packed with beautiful music, including celebratory choruses for Act II’s evocation of Christmas Eve in the Latin Quarter, and a poignant final scene.</p>
      <p>Richard Jones’ character-led production perfectly captures La Bohème’s mixture of comedy, romance and tragedy, with striking designs by Stewart Laing.</p>
      <p>The cast features some of the greatest interpreters of Puccini’s bohemian lovers performing today, as well as former members of The Royal Operas Jette Parker Young Artists Programme.</p>
      <p>The opera is sung in Italian with English subtitles, and the screening at Airdrie town hall cinema is approximately two hours and 30 minutes long.</p>
      <p>It takes place on January 29 and to book tickets for the showing contact the phone number or website above.</p>
