      <p>The latest episode features interviews with the founders of some of the various charities that the @SussexRoyal Instagram account follows to highlight small grassroot charities and give them a bigger platform. </p>
      <p>Each month @SussexRoyal selects 15 new accounts to follow; all amazing people with stories that reflect the passions and interests of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p>'Diana would be so proud of what Harry and Meghan are doing with their platform at the moment…being creative with it, thinking outside the box, doing things differently,' explained Omid Scobie. </p>
      <p>'If she was around today, she'd be doing exactly the same on social media.'</p>
      <p>He added: 'There was a time when what went on behind palace walls was top secret, there was a veil over the members of the royal family.'</p>

      <p>'Now with social media…that's changed the way that the royal family communicate with the world.'</p>
      <p>The video series also heard from CJ Bowry, the founder of Sal's Shoes and Jaime Thurston, founder of 52 Lives. </p>
      <p>In the episode they reflect on how they felt, and the impact that this unexpected follow has had on their lives and businesses.  </p>
      <p>Speaking of the shock of being followed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on social media, CJ Bowry, of Sal's Shoes, said: </p>
      <p>'I think it was five minutes of hysterical laughter, and then as quickly as I'd received the notification saying that Harry and Meghan had followed the Sal's Shoes page, more and more people started following us.'  </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jaime Thurston, 52 Lives, added: 'My first thought was: Is it the real account? I clicked on it to make sure it wasn't a fake account or anything and when I realised it was real, I was over the moon.'</p>
      <p>'We've had an increase in followers on Instagram and particularly international followers… it's about reaching new audiences with our message which is about kindness.'</p>
