      <h1>White House, Democrats close to USMCA trade deal: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:15:29+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p>The White House and House Democrats are on the verge of a new North American trade deal in what would give <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> a signature legislative victory. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-congressional-democrats-on-cusp-of-revised-north-american-trade-deal-trumka-says/2019/12/09/096c4f3c-1a8f-11ea-87f7-f2e91143c60d_story.html">reported Monday</a> that AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said the two sides had come to a deal and that the labor union was reviewing it. The White House and AFL-CIO did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But a senior Democratic aide pushed back on the report, saying that nothing had yet been finalized. "We’re still studying the proposal," the aide said. Trump announced the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) more than a year ago. Negotiations with House Democrats have been ongoing ever since, with Democratic leaders pushing for stronger labor and environmental regulations. A deal on the USMCA would come at a time when House Democrats are moving to impeach Trump and would also benefit Democrats by helping the party argue it is legislating even as impeachment moves forward.</p>
      <p>The legislation is a divisive point among some Democrats, however. Sharp critics of the president have been reluctant to vote on the USMCA and give Trump a legislative victory, while some more moderate lawmakers have been wary of returning to their districts with impeachment dominating the conversation.</p>
      <p>But Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-Calif.) has been adamant that the caucus can keep impeachment separate from legislation, and she has met in recent weeks with U.S. Trade Representative <a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-bob-lighthizer">Robert Lighthizer</a> and other administration officials.</p>
      <p>Trump has repeatedly hammered Pelosi for her decision not to bring the USMCA up for a vote to date, accusing her of delaying it to shepherd votes on impeachment.</p>
      <p>"I'll see if I can be switched from 'no' to 'yes,'" Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bill-pascrell">Bill Pascrell</a> (D-N.J.), a member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade and close union ally, said late last week when asked about the USMCA.</p>
      <p>One of the major questions hanging over the talks in recent weeks was whether Mexico would agree to invasive oversight and enforcement of the deal.</p>
      <p>"We don't have very much confidence in that the government of Mexico can fulfill what we're going to be putting in these trade bill," Pascrell said.</p>
      <p>"If they can't get [El] Chapo's son from killing people and his cohorts, how are they going to follow through and administer the legislation we're talking about?" he added, referring to the drug cartel leader.</p>
      <p>But even without union support, Pascrell said some members of Democratic leadership would be eager to push ahead.</p>
