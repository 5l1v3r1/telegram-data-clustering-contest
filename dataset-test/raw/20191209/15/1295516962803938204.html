      <p>Jonathan Groff, who's currently gracing the big screen as the voice of Kristoff in Disney's <i>Frozen 2</i>, has been cast in an undisclosed role in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/matrix-4/"><i>The Matrix 4</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Operating under the working title <a href="https://www.cbr.com/matrix-4-working-title-2/"><i>Project Ice Cream</i></a>, little is known about the plot of <i>The Matrix 4</i> at this time. However, last month, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/matrix-4s-script-ambitious-keanu-reeves/">Reeves confirmed he'd seen the script</a> and said, "It's very ambitious. As it should be!" Additionally, it was reported that studio execs may be looking to cast a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/matrix-4-young-morpheus/">younger incarnation of Morpheus</a> for the planned sequel.</p>
      <p>Officially confirmed to be in active development in August after years of rumors and speculation, the fourth <i>Matrix</i> is expected to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/matrix-4-confirmed-reeves-moss-wachowski/">begin principal photography</a> in early 2020, though <a href="https://screenrant.com/matrix-4-movie-release-date-cast-story-trailer/">no release date has been announced</a> by Warner Bros.</p>
      <p>"Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality are even more relevant now," Lana Wachowski said when <a href="https://www.cbr.com/matrix-4-confirmed-reeves-moss-wachowski/">the film was announced</a>. "I’m very happy to have these characters back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my brilliant friends."</p>
