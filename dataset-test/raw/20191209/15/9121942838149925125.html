      <p>HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A man was shot and wounded by police over the weekend following a vehicle chase in South Florida, authorities said.</p>
      <p>An officer attempted to make a traffic stop for a moving violation early Sunday morning in Hallandale Beach, police spokeswoman RaShana Dabney-Donovan told news outlets. The driver refused to stop and headed north toward Hollywood. An officer reported seeing a passenger holding a gun during the chase.</p>
      <p>The vehicle pursuit ended at a Hollywood gas station, but two men in the car tried to flee on foot, Dabney-Donovan said. An officer chased the men on foot and fired his weapon, striking one of the suspects, police said. The man was taken to a nearby hospital with injuries that weren’t considered life threatening. The other man was detained nearby.</p>
      <p>Police didn’t say what prompted the officer to shoot at the suspect.</p>
      <p>Police didn’t immediately identify the names or races or the officer who fired or the suspect who was shot.</p>
