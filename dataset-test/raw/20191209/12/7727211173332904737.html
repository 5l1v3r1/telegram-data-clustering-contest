      <h2>Rubie launched an astonishing attack on Liverpool as Bobby Duncan left the club in the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:38:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/joe-rimmer/" target="_blank">Joe Rimmer</a></address>
      <p>Saif Rubie, the agent of former Liverpool striker Bobby Duncan, has been fined and banned by the FA.</p>
      <p>Duncan's controversial move from Liverpool to Italy went through in July after negotiations fraught with issues between the Reds and Rubie.</p>
      <p>Rubie<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bobby-duncan-saif-rubie-liverpool-16828555"> launched an astonishing attack on the Reds</a> and sporting director <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/michael-edwards">Michael Edwards</a> in particular.</p>
      <p>Among a number of allegations were released on Twitter  - <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-bobby-duncan-agent-response-16829365">which prompted a strong response from Liverpool</a> - was that the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bobby-duncan">Duncan</a> was being kept at the club against his will after the Reds turned down an earlier offer from Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>The agent later <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bobby-duncans-agent-saif-rubie-16831760">removed his Twitter account</a> after an angry backlash from Liverpool fans.</p>
      <p>And now Rubie is banned from acting as an intermediary for six weeks, as well as being handed a £10,000 fine and sent on an FA Education Programme for improper use of social media. It is not specified which posts the punishment is for.</p>
      <p>A statement from the FA lists two breaches of rules including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is alleged that the particiant's comment on Twitter was improper and/brought the game into disrepute, contrary to Rule E3(1)</li>
        <li>It is alleged that the participant's post on Twitter was improper and/or abusive and/or insulting, contrary to Rule E3(1).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rubie is banned from December 4 to January 15.</p>
