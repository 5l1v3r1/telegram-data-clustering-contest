      <p>A POTENTIALLY LIFE-saving defibrillator that was stolen from outside a shop in Drogheda, Co Louth has been found.</p>
      <p>It was stolen on Friday night from outside the Village Store in Aston Village, Drogheda.</p>
      <p>The theft by two young men was captured on CCTV footage that has been given to the gardaí.</p>
      <p>Local resident Kenneth Flood confirmed this morning that it had been found.</p>
      <p>He said it was discovered “this morning in Redshank Court. It wasn’t there yesterday so it was brought back and dumped.”</p>
      <p>Locals had searched for the device over the weekend; twelve local residents, including staff at the nearby Aston Village Educate Together primary school had been trained as first responders and were able to use it.</p>
      <p>Flood, who paid for the device during his time as a councillor, said that the Order of Malta will check the AED to see if it is okay to use.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend a funding page was set up to pay for a replacement.</p>
      <p>Flood confirmed this morning that Sinn Féin councillors have agreed to cover the costs of replacing it or repairing it from their community allocation funds.</p>
      <p>It was one of two defibrillators stolen over the weekend, the other was taken in Wicklow.</p>
      <p>In a statement on its Facebook page today, Community First Responders (CFR) Wicklow Town confirmed that a defibrillator had been found over the weekend. </p>
      <p>It said that the defibrillator had been damaged and that the LED screen had been smashed. </p>
      <p>“We will likely send off [the] machine for testing and see if it can be fixed, but highly unlikely,” the group said.</p>
      <p>Gardaí have confirmed that they are investigating both thefts. </p>
      <p>No arrests have been made with regard to either case.</p>
