      <h1>Beyonce’s Rep Confirms She Is Not Doing A Las Vegas Residency</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:20:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Tanja Saric</a></address>
      <p>Beyonce will not be hitting the Las Vegas strip any time soon.</p>
      <p>In a statement to <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/beyonce-las-vegas-residency-rumors-false-1203428422/">Variety</a>, </i>the singer’s rep has confirmed that she will not be doing a residency in Sin City.</p>
      <p>It’s “absolutely not true,” the rep said.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, rumours that Queen Bey would be getting her own Las Vegas residency began flying when a website called “LoveBScott” posted a story saying she would announce shows in the first half of 2020. The article also said that this would have made Beyonce the highest-paid entertainer in the city. The website even cited “sources.”</p>

      <p>This, of course, sent Beyonce fans into a frenzy, with some claiming there was no way she would ever do this instead of touring, while others said she might prefer the steadiness a residency can bring.</p>
      <p>The “Lemonade” singer released the <i>I am…Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas</i> album which was recorded during her “I Am…” tour in 2009. For now, this is the closest fans can see of Beyonce in Vegas.</p>
