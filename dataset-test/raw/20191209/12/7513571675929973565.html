        <b>A high court in Yola, Adamawa state capital, has sentenced Ibrahim Mustapha, a fake medical doctor, to 54 years in prison.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In June, the Department of State Services (DSS) arrested Mustapha, who was employed as a doctor in the state with forged medical certificates.</p>
      <p>The convict was the principal medical officer at the cottage hospitals in Mayo Belwa and Fufore, and had reportedly performed surgical operations on several patients since 2015.</p>
      <p>At least 15 patients were reported dead after Mustapha performed surgical operations on them.</p>
      <p>Delivering the verdict, Nathan Musa, the presiding judge, said the court considered Mustapha’s earlier plea of guilty.</p>
      <p>“On counts one to three, I sentenced him six months each with the option of fine of N20,000 each,” the judge ruled.</p>
      <p>“On count eight, I sentence him to three years imprisonment with the option of N50,000 fine.</p>
      <p>“On counts four, five, six, seven and 10, I sentenced him to 10 years of prison term on each of the counts without the option of a fine.”</p>
      <p>The judge said the sentence will run concurrently.</p>
      <p>Bola Ilori, the state director of DSS, said Mustapha started his fake practice as a ward attendant in Gombe state before he was employed in Adamawa.</p>
