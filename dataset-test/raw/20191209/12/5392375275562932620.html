      <p>Pursuing a genuine full-screen design will ruin the smartphone makers. They are all investing a lot in the design of such screens. Also, they want the phone display to get larger and larger. In other niches, it’s called Gigantomania. In this sense, China-based smartphone markets have been on everyone’s lips. First, Xiaomi released its original MIX series handset. Later the market hosted devices with bangs, a drop screen design, and a punch-hole screen design. But this is not all. Some companies like Nubia released dual-screen handsets. Thus year, two tech giants introduced their folding screen smartphones. But Xiaomi will always stand out. Not that long ago, it showcased a concept phone, the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/27/mi-mix-alpha-unboxing-video-surfaces-online/">Mi MIX Alpha</a>. It takes the full-screen concept a step higher in comparison to the previous-gen Mi MIX 3 with sliding screen design. But the latter may return in face of another Xiaomi smartphone.</p>

      <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.tigermobiles.com/">tigermobiles</a> released a new Xiaomi smartphone design patent. As the photos show, the phone uses a quad-camera module and a sliding display design to expand the screen area.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Xiaomi applied for a design patent to the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China as early as August 28, 2018. But this patent was officially announced on December 6, 2019.</p>

      <p>From the sketches published by CNIPA and the sketches designed by tigermobiles, we can see that this phone uses a front dual-camera design. The left side of the phone has a large frame. And the other three sides look narrower. The back of the phone also uses a dual-camera design.</p>

      <p>The difference is that this phone can be rolled sideways to get a bigger screen. In order to increase the screen display area, many smartphone manufacturers choose two design methods: foldable screen and surround screen. In this sense, the sliding screen is a new design.</p>
