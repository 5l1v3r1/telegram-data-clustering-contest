      <h1>Celtic hero Fraser Forster's Rangers heroics emulate keeper's fantastic display</h1>
      <h2>The Great Wall's display in the Betfred Cup final was incredible, but 24 hours earlier, another goalie was working wonders of his own.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:41:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic hero Fraser Forster may have hogged the headlines for his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/betfred-cup-rangers-0-celtic-21052535">Hampden heroics</a> - but 'The Great Wall' has serious competition when it comes to the goalkeeping performance of the weekend.</p>
      <p>Forster was immense as Celtic beat Rangers 1-0 to win the Scottish League Cup, pulling off a string of sensational stops - including a penalty save - to deny Steven Gerrard's men.</p>
      <p>But as incredible as his display was, 24 hours earlier, Irvine Meadow keeper Paddy O'Neil was working cup wonders of his own.</p>
      <p>The former Brechin City star was in inspired form as Meadow beat Glenafton 4-2 on penalties in a Scottish Junior Cup fourth round replay.</p>
      <p>He saved Glens' first two spot kicks in the shootout to set Meadow up for victory but his finest moment in an all-round stunning performance between the sticks came late in the match with the sides locked at 1-1.</p>
      <p>O'Neill produced a jaw-dropping triple-save to keep Glens at bay, twice hauling himself off the turf in the space of a few seconds to deny the 2017 winners a certain goal.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old, who signed from Brechin in October, admitted he'd never had a game like it but insisted he was just happy to repay the faith shown in him by Meadow boss Brian McGinty.</p>
      <p>"I had a wee bit of a shaky start coming here but the gaffer showed great faith in us, so did the boys," he said.</p>
      <p>"I've taken a bit of stick over the last couple of weeks and they've backed me up. I was just really more relieved and happy to repay them a wee bit.</p>
      <p>"I've had some key moments in games before but never really any consecutive saves like that. It's a good confidence booster to be honest.</p>
      <p>"By the time the penalties came I felt 10 feet tall.</p>
      <p>"We did a bit of bit of penalty practice at the end of every session over the last couple of weeks so I'd faced a few penalties.</p>
      <p>"I've given a few away this season too - so I've had plenty of practice!"</p>
      <p>O'Neil is now relishing the prospect of playing in the last 16 of the competiion.</p>
      <p>"I've never really had a decent Scottish Cup run," he added.</p>
      <p>"At Brechin, we played Celtic once at Parkhead. We've never really got far though.</p>
      <p>"A home tie would be preferable in the next round but it doesn't really matter who it is because you've got to beat the best teams to win it."</p>
