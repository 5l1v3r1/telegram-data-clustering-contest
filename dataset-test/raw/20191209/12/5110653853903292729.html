      <h1>Seahawks vs. Rams final score: Seattle's offense stifled in crucial loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:12:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:12</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>The Seahawks slipped up in the race for the NFC West on Sunday night, looking lifeless for much of their 28-12 loss to the Rams in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Seattle kicked a field goal on its opening drive, but the Russell Wilson-ledoffense wouldn't score again until the fourth quarter. The Rams scored 21 consecutive points to close the first half and added a backbreaking touchdown in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <p>Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff had a strong night overall (22-for-31 passing, 293 yards), but his two touchdowns were matched by two interceptions. After the Seahawks took that 3-0 lead, he marched his team down the field for two touchdown drives and completed nine of his first 10 passes.</p>
      <p>Goff had an ugly start to the second half, however, throwing a pick-six on the opening drive and another interception on the following possession. That helped give Seattle three possessions while trailing 21-9 in the third quarter, but the offense managed just two first downs during that stretch. Wilson finished 22 for 36 for 245 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception.</p>
      <p>A 7-yard touchdown run by Rams running back Todd Gurley put the game away; it gave Los Angeles (8-5) a 28-9 lead with 11:07 to play.</p>
      <p>Seattle's loss carries massive implications for the NFC West; the Seahawks (10-3) are one game behind the 49ers (11-2), who beat the Saints earlier Sunday. The result also helps keep the Rams' slim wild-card hopes alive.</p>
