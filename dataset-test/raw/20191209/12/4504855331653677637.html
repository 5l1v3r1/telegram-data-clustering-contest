      <h1>A New Jersey bill would require schoolchildren to be taught cursive handwriting</h1>

      <p>(CNN) — Should children be required to learn cursive?</p>
      <p>A New Jersey legislator says so. Assemblywoman Angela McKnight has introduced a bill that would require elementary schools to teach kids how to read and write in the graceful, flowing loops taught to previous generations as a matter of course.</p>
      <p>You remember cursive handwriting. It’s what we use to sign our names on, say, a check or other legal document. It’s fallen out of favor in the digital age, even getting dropped from Common Core standards in 2010.</p>
      <p>Since then, many schools have stopped teaching it, New Jersey Assembly Democrats say.</p>
      <p>“In some cases, children are entering middle school without knowing how to sign their own name in cursive,” McKnight (D-Hudson) said in a statement. “We are doing our children a disservice by not teaching them a vital skill they will need for the rest of their lives.”</p>
      <p>California, Texas, North Carolina and other states have moved to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/cursive-is-coming-back-trnd/index.html">encourage cursive</a> in recent years.</p>
      <p>“Our world has indeed become increasingly dependent on technology, but how will our students ever know how to read a scripted font on a word document, or even sign the back of a check, if they never learn to read and write in cursive?” McKnight said.</p>
      <p>Even in the days of texting, some research shows cursive still can improve cognitive development, spelling and writing speed.</p>
      <p>“When writing cursive, the word becomes a unit, rather than a series of separate strokes, and correct spelling is more likely to be retained,” says the <a href="https://dyslexiaida.org/why-bother-with-cursive/">International Dyslexia Association.</a> “The Declaration of Independence and many other important archival documents are written in cursive. A cursive signature is more difficult to forge than a printed one.”</p>
      <p>Research also shows that we learn more when taking notes in longhand compared to <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf">taking notes on, say, a laptop</a>.</p>
      <p>“Knowing how to write in cursive isn’t only for writing ‘thank you’ cards to Grandma — research suggests it can boost kids’ reading and writing skills, too,” says publishing company <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/parents/books-and-reading/raise-a-reader-blog/cursive-writing-practice.html">Scholastic</a>.</p>
      <p>The bill was introduced in the state legislature last month and is heading to the education committee for review.</p>
