      <h2>The 26-year-old made his first Blues start in Saturday’s 3-2 win at Reading, beginning a game for the first time since February</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:27:50+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Josh McEachran’s Birmingham City career is up and running- but it could all have been so different.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/josh-mceachran">26-year-old</a> made his first Blues start in Saturday’s 3-2 win at Reading, beginning a game for the first time since February.</p>
      <p>He delivered a polished and influential display before leaving the field utterly spent but having earned the praise of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> ’ coaches and supporters alike.</p>
      <p>That response might not have been quite so positive had things worked out in a different way in the summer.</p>

      <p>After his release from Brentford McEachran passed the off-season as a free agent, seemingly destined for a reunion with his former Bees boss Dean Smith at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>“I was close to signing but one or two things went a bit wrong and it didn’t end up. I am here now, I am happy here now so I don’t really need to speak about that,” McEachran said at last week’s Junior Blues Christmas party.</p>
      <p>What he is happy to talk about is how unsettling it had been spending the summer without a club - and then when he did finally find one - at the invitation of a former Griffin Park team-mate, he did so with a lot to prove and improve.</p>

      <p>“You don’t know whether you are going to be in England, America, anywhere in the world - that’s obviously not good.</p>
      <p>“I finally got sorted here, after a trial at Birmingham - thanks to Harlee Dean really. He got me in. I am excited to be here and am excited for the season.</p>
      <p>“It probably was humbling having to prove myself again, I wasn’t really expecting it to be honest because I was a free agent and there were quite a few teams and I was umming and ahing where to go and stuff.</p>
      <p>“To come here, to get the opportunity to come and play for Birmingham, obviously it’s a massive club in the Championship, I have seen what they want to do in the next year, two  years.</p>
      <p>“They want to get back to the Premier League and that’s what I want to do so I am grateful to be here.</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to come here and prove myself.</p>
      <p>“It was tough getting physically ready, I didn’t have a pre-season so I was always playing catch up.</p>
      <p>“I think with the 23s games and the training I was on I have got up to speed with things, now I just want to start playing a few games with the first team and cement my place in the team.”</p>
      <p>McEachran’s arrival suits both parties, coinciding with a footballing make-over, one that has seen Blues go from one of the most direct teams in the country to an increasingly attractive one.</p>
      <p>“I have seen a lot of difference coming into the team and seeing the football they wanted to play, from last season and the season before.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I would have had a chance of playing in those two seasons because it wasn’t my style of football.</p>
      <p>“But the football that Pep wants to play now definitely suits me a lot more.”</p>
      <p>That much was clear for everyone to see in his first start in Royal Blue.</p>
