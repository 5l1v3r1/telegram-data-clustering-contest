      <h1>Jonathan Sexton ruled out of Champions Cup clash against Northampton Saints with knee injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:39:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:39</time> by <a rel="author">Des Berry</a></address>
      <p>Jonathan Sexton will not play against Northampton Saints in the Champions Cup on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Leinster out-half will see a specialist sometime today to further investigate a knee injury suffered against Saints in the reverse fixture last Saturday.</p>
      <p>There must be a serious concern that Sexton's involvement in the Six Nations is in jeopardy.</p>
      <p>It looks like James Ryan will also miss out on the round four rendezvous at the Aviva from a blow to the head.</p>
      <p>The second row is following return-to-play protocols and is unlikely to be risked.</p>
      <p>Hooker Sean Cronin will return to full training this week after a bothersome neck problem.</p>
      <p>Centre Joe Tomane will miss 6-8 weeks after re-aggravating his hamstring just when the centre was finding his form.</p>
