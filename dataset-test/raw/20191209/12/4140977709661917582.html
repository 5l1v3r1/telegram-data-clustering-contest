                          <p>Fellaini’s contracted with the Chinese Super League outfit until December 2021 with an option of an additional year. Meanwhile, Mourinho is known for having physicality in midfield and he sees Fellaini as a valuable addition considering Eric Dier is not standing up to the expectations.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>Although Fellaini would not be an outright regular starter at the club with Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko and Giovani Lo Celso contesting for the central area of the pitch, the Belgian seems to be a viable option in bolstering the bench.</p>
                            <p>The season in Chinese league is finally over and Fellaini has over 3 months to think about the reported proposal to ply his trade in Europe once again.</p>
