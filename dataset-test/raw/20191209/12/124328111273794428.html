      <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Get off my man! Moment Raheem Sterling's fiancée Paige Milian SHOVES woman out the way as she twerks against Man City star at his Great Gatsby-themed 25th birthday</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/raheem-sterling/index.html"><b>Raheem Sterling</b></a>'s fiancée Paige Milian shoved a woman out of the way who was twerking against the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><b>Manchester City</b></a> star at his 25th birthday. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/premierleague/index.html"><b>Premier League</b></a> ace was seen on video enjoying an intimate dance with a glamorous party-goer, who was grinding her hips against him as he bent her over. </p>
      <p>But their moment in the spotlight didn't last long as Paige quickly barged the woman aside so she could reclaim the rights to her man - and began twerking on him herself. </p>
