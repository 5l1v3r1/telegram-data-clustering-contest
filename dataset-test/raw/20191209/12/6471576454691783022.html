      <p>Vehicles with the 3.0-liter EcoBoost V6 engine are potentially affected, namely 3,858 in the United States and federal territories plus 35 in Canada and seven in Mexico. These mid-sized SUVs were produced with a convolute protective sleeve on the liquid fuel line that isn't long enough. This condition translates to contact with the vapor fuel line, and over time, hard contact between the two lines may turn into a fuel leak as well as a vehicle fire.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/ford/">Ford</a> isn‚Äôt aware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue, but nevertheless, all of these vehicles need to be fixed. Dealers are to inspect the protective convolute on the liquid fuel line, and if it doesn‚Äôt cover the entire length of the line, then a replacement will be fitted.</p>
      <p>The second <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/recall/">recall</a> of our story involves the 2017 through 2019 model years of the F-Series Super Duty. The F-250, F-350, and F-450 are called back over a tailgate problem, and the number of trucks affected by this condition total 261,617 in the U.S. and its territories, as well as Canada.</p>
      <p>If equipped with an electric tailgate latch-release switch, then water may enter the electrical wiring system. Causing a short circuit results in the unintended release of the tailgate, which isn‚Äôt a nice scenario at all. Imagine that happening while carrying a fridge in the bed on the highway or while the Ford F-Series Super Duty is stationary and a kid plays next to the tailgate.</p>
      <p>For this problem, dealers have been instructed to modify the wiring harnesses in the tailgate frame by adding jumper pigtails. Their purpose is to isolate the release control circuits, and as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the Ford Motor Company will also install a different tailgate release switch. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>6 DECEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>Safety recall for select 2017-19 Ford F-250, F-350 and F-450 Super Duty vehicles for unintended tailgate opening</p>
        <p>Ford is issuing a safety recall for select 2017-19 Ford F-250, F-350 and F-450 Super Duty vehicles for unintended tailgate opening. In affected vehicles with an electric tailgate latch-release switch mounted in the tailgate handle, water entering the electrical wiring system may cause a short circuit, resulting in unintended switch activation and release of the tailgate latches. This could cause the tailgate to open unintentionally, whether the vehicle is in motion or stationary. This condition may result in the loss of unrestrained cargo, increasing the risk of a crash. Vehicles with a mechanical tailgate release handle are not affected.</p>
        <p>Ford is not aware of any reports of accident or injury related to this condition.</p>
        <p>This action affects 231,664 vehicles in the U.S. and federal territories and 29,953 in Canada.</p>
        <p>Affected vehicles were built at Kentucky Truck Plant from Oct. 8, 2015, to Nov. 3, 2019.</p>
        <p>Dealers will modify the tailgate frame wiring harnesses by adding jumper pigtails to isolate the tailgate release control circuits and install a new tailgate handle release switch. The Ford reference number for this recall is 19S48.</p>
        <p>Safety recall for select 2020 Ford Explorer and 2020 Lincoln Aviator vehicles with 3.0-liter engines</p>
        <p>Ford is issuing a safety recall for select 2020 Ford Explorer and 2020 Lincoln Aviator vehicles. In some affected vehicles, the convolute protective sleeve on the liquid fuel line is not long enough, which may allow for potential hard contact with the convolute-protected vapor fuel line. Over time, with vibration and engine roll, hard contact between the two fuel lines could cause the convolute on the vapor fuel line to rub through the plastic liquid fuel line. A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source increases the risk of a fire.</p>
        <p>Ford is not aware of any reports of accident, injury or fire related to this condition.</p>
        <p>This action affects 3,858 vehicles in the U.S. and federal territories, 35 in Canada, and seven in Mexico.</p>
        <p>Affected vehicles were built at Chicago Assembly Plant:</p>
        <p>Ford Explorer vehicles built Jan. 18-July 17, 2019</p>
        <p>Lincoln Aviator vehicles built Jan. 15-July 17, 2019<br/>Dealers will inspect vehicles for a full-length yellow-colored protective convolute on the liquid fuel line. If the convolute does not cover the full length of the liquid fuel line, dealers will remove the existing convolute, replace it with one that has the correct length and secure it with a tie strap. The Ford reference number for this recall is 19S49.</p>
