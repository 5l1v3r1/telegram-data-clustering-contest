      <h1>Land Rover Defender By Overfinch Is A $315,000 One-Off</h1>
      <h2>Has Overfinch created the most unique Land Rover Defender in the world?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:06:49+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>Overfinch has been <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/overfinch-gives-range-rover-a-bold-new-look">modifying Land Rovers and Range Rovers since 1975</a>, but this is one of the tuner's most unique creations to date. What you're looking at here is a one-off Soft Top <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/land-rover/defender">Land Rover Defender</a> conversion specially commissioned by a client. Based on a Defender 90, the Overfinch 6.2L Soft Top Defender has been stripped down from a four-seat configuration and rebuilt as a two-seater.</p>
      <p>The exterior is finished in Emerald Green with a matching removable soft top cover that clips onto the specially constructed roll-over protection cage. Overfinch has also converted the rear load space using marine-grade teak and built a lockable storage box finished with the addition of an Overfinch 'Special-Commission' plaque.</p>

      <p>Under the hood is a new General Motors-sourced, 6.2-liter V8 producing 450 horsepower and encased in carbon fiber, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and complemented with a stainless-steel sport exhaust system. This makes it even more powerful than the limited-edition 400-hp <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/original-land-rover-defender-reborn-with-400-hp-v8-special-edition">Land Rover Defender Works V8</a>. With this setup, Overfinch claims the Soft Top Defender will reach a limited top speed of 110 mph. Uprated six-piston front and four-piston piston rear brakes improve the off-roader's stopping power.</p>
      <p>Inside the opulent interior, Overfinch's Soft Top Defender is fitted with Recaro sports seats trimmed in Emerald and Tan leather featuring contrast stitching, while the dashboard and steering wheel are fully upholstered. It's a stark contrast to the original Defender's utilitarian styling. Overfinch has also applied fine knurling on chrome components such as the door handles, gear selector, handbrake, pedals and instrument dials.</p>

      <p>Handcrafted Overfinch lettering adorns the hood and special branding has also been applied to door handles, fuel cap, wheel caps, side sills and headrests to highlight the SUV's exclusivity. Bespoke 18-inch Apollo alloy wheels finished in bespoke Emerald Green complete the look. According to Overfinch, this unique take on the Land Rover Defender costs an eye-watering Â£239,990 ($315,820).</p>
      <p>"This Defender demonstrates our DNA of Land Rover restoration and contemporary styling.
