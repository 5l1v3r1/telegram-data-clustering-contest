      <p>“The Palace lauds Miss Philippines Gazini Ganados for representing our country well in the Miss Universe pageant in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Ms. Ganados has given pride and glory to the Filipino nation by showcasing the unique beauty and talent of the Filipina,” Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo said.</p>
      <p>Panelo said Ganados’ experience in joining the Miss Universe should “add further to her development as a beauty queen.”</p>
      <p>He added that the Palace wishes Ganados all the best in her future endeavors.</p>
      <p>Ganados joined the set of top 20 Miss Universe semi-finalists but failed to make it to the next round. The towering beauty reportedly hoped for a back-to-back win for the Philippines in the international pageant following the footsteps of Miss Universe Catriona Gray.</p>
