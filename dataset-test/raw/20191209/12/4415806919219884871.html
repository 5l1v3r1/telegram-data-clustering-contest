      <p>Jessica Harrington’s 2017 Cheltenham Gold Cup hero Sizing John is set to make his return from a two-year absence at Punchestown on New Year’s Eve after pleasing connections in a post-racing workout at the County Kildare circuit on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The nine-year-old completed the rare treble of the Irish Gold Cup at Leopardstown, the blue riband at Cheltenham and the Punchestown Gold Cup in the first half of 2017.</p>
      <p>However, although he made a flying start to the following campaign in the John Durkan, he disappointed at Leopardstown over the Christmas period and injuries have kept him off the track ever since.</p>
      <p>While it has been a long road back, Harrington was delighted with Sizing John’s latest racecourse spin and views the Bet With Tote At Punchestown Hurdle as an ideal comeback target.</p>
      <p>“All is good. I was happy with the way he worked and Robert (Power) was very happy – and he’s the most important person,” said the Moone-based trainer.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t enter him in anything over Christmas. At the moment we’re aiming towards the conditions hurdle at Punchestown on New Year’s Eve, that’s the plan.”</p>
      <p>Harrington also provided an update on her three-times Grade One-winning hurdler Supasundae, who is likely to make his seasonal reappearance in the Matheson Hurdle on December 29.</p>
      <p>“He worked after racing at Punchestown as well and just got a bit tired,” Harrington added.</p>
      <p>“He is a very hard horse to get fit, but he’s getting there and hopefully he’ll have a run over Christmas in the two-mile Grade One.”</p>
