      <blockquote>Last year we released a <a href="https://crowdsim3d.com/">crowd simulation add-on for Blender</a>. This year we've added traffic simulation to the add-on. We've created a short video that shows the features and possibilities of the traffic simulation. More tutorials on traffic and crowd simulations will follow soon.<br/><br/>The traffic simulation is released with the CrowdSim add-on but is also available as a separate add-on. Besides the paid add-on there is also a demo version available. The demo contains all features but is limited to 25 agents. There's a discount 'till the 1st of December 2019.</blockquote>
