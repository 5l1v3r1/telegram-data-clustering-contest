      <h1>Delingpole: Britain’s Political Class Has Surrendered to the Green Blob</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:46:26+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">James Delingpole</a></address>
      <p>The entirety of Britain’s political class, left and right, has surrendered to the Green Blob.</p>
      <p>Here is how the various parties responded to a question from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/08/what-will-you-do-about-the-climate-crisis-the-parties-answer"><i>Guardian</i></a>: ‘Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation?’</p>
      <blockquote><b>Conservatives</b>: Yes, it is one of the biggest issues facing the world. Thanks to the efforts of successive governments, the UK has cut carbon emissions by more than any similar developed country. We have also already doubled our support for developing nations to tackle climate change. <b>Greens</b>: Absolutely. The science is clear: it is the biggest threat facing the UK and the world. <b>Labour</b>: Yes and this election is our last chance to tackle it. We’re already off course to meet our targets and radical and urgent action over the next five years is essential. <b>Liberal Democrats</b>: Yes, a Liberal Democrat government would solve Brexit on day one, so climate change would be the biggest issue. <b>SNP</b>: Scotland – like the rest of the world – faces a climate emergency. We have a moral responsibility to tackle climate change and will lead the way in showing how our society can transition to net zero.</blockquote>
      <p>As you see, there is not a single mainstream party left in Britain that is prepared to stand up to eco-fascism.</p>
      <p>There is no credible evidence whatsoever that the world is facing a ‘climate crisis’, still less that it is ‘the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation?’ (What? Not Brexit? Immigration? Healthcare? Knife Crime? The Economy?)</p>
      <p>Yet all the main parties, even the Conservatives, have bought into the false narrative written by the kind of people who hate them and always will.</p>
      <p>I analysed the green phenomenon in my book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Watermelons-Environmentalists-Destroying-Stealing-Childrens/dp/1849544050"><i>Watermelons</i></a> and concluded that the primary purpose of environmentalism is to advance leftist causes – wealth redistribution, bigger government, identity politics, the destruction of Western industrial civilisation, the promotion of commissar-style ‘experts’ and technocrats, state-mandated restrictions on freedom – behind a cloak of green righteousness. Watermelons: green on the outside, red on the inside.</p>
      <p>The only choice British voters are being offered is one of degrees: do you support unaffordable, uncosted, economically debilitating green lunacy or do you support head-banging, window-licking, away-with-the-fairies green lunacy or some shade of green lunacy in between?</p>
      <p>Not even the Brexit Party has been prepared to talk sense on this issue. Yes, Nigel Farage has been robust. But not his party, as I reported with some disappointment, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/09/30/vote-conservative-get-more-green-crap/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>This cowardice in the face of perhaps the world’s most dangerous ideological movement is something we shall all come to rue.</p>
      <p>Already, we inhabit such a bonkers climate of environmental righteousness, that the <i>Guardian</i> feels able to ask questions like this of Britain’s political parties:</p>
      <blockquote>Will your government implement a policy to reduce red meat consumption in the UK?</blockquote>
      <p>And instead of getting a two-word response from the Conservatives, the second which is ‘off!’, the actual response from the Conservatives is, as follows:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Conservatives</b>: The meat that British farmers produce is already significantly less carbon-intensive than meat produced elsewhere in the world. We will back our farmers to match their own net zero by 2040 ambition with funding to develop new agri-tech to reduce emissions and farm in an even more environmentally friendly way.</blockquote>
      <p>Why do the Conservatives pander to the enemy in this way? It ought to be a straightforward Conservative position that it is not the business of government to interfere with people’s diets. Since when did the Conservatives so lose touch with their ideological first principles that they are now prepared to treat insinuating, loaded questions like this from the<i> Guardian</i> with anything other than total contempt?</p>
      <p>I hear nasty rumours that once the Conservatives have won this election, as I believe they will with a decent working majority, they plan to put Michael Gove in charge of implementing their Zero Carbon by 2050 policy.</p>
      <p>Britain’s contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions is about one percent. What is the point of putting one of the ablest ministers in government in charge of an economically destructive, environmentally pointless crusade to decarbonise the UK economy when, within a year, any notional benefits will have been more than offset by China’s new coal-fired power stations?</p>

      <p>Just like under David Cameron and Theresa May, the Conservatives are whoring their principles in order to attract the kind of people who ought never to be let within a million miles of influencing party policy because these people are not and never will be — at least not until their frontal lobes have formed and they become productive members of the economy — Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Like this fellow, for example:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Is it any wonder so many natural Conservative voters are so unenthused about their party’s direction of travel?</p>
