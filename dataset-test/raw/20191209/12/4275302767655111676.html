      <p><a href="https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/pedestrian-dies-after-being-hit-by-school-bus-on-a92/">As reported in the Evening Express</a>, emergency services were called to the A92 near Newtonhill at about 9.45am on Sunday after a person was struck by a silver single-decker coach.</p>
      <p>The incident, which also involved a white Mazda car, took place on the southbound section of the road.</p>
      <p>The bus was carrying pupils from the Oban High School Pipe Band back home after they attended the Trad Music Awards in Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>The A92 was closed for more than 12 hours as police investigated the collision.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the force confirmed that a 69-year-old man had died in the incident.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Scott Deans, from the Road Policing Unit, said: “This incident is completely tragic and our thoughts are with those involved. One death on our roads is one too many and the heartbreak that is left behind is far-reaching.</p>
      <p>“Inquiries are continuing into the incident and I would ask anyone with information or dash cam footage who has not yet come forward to please get in touch.</p>
      <p>“We are particularly keen to trace an orange Ford Focus and a purple motor car that passed the scene around the time of the collision.”</p>
