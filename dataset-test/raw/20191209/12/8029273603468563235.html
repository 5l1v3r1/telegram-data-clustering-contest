      <p>In January, the Seoul office of the National Tax Service filed a complaint with the prosecution requesting an investigation into suspicions that he may have evaded gift tax.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors did not charge him with tax evasion but discovered borrowed-name bank accounts assumed to have been used by Cho during the probe.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors believe that he may have used the accounts to appropriate company money and receive kickbacks.</p>
      <p>Cho claimed that he had already made up for the embezzled funds, but a court issued an arrest warrant for him on Nov. 21, saying that his actions were grave.</p>
      <p>Cho also serves as the chief operations officer at Hankook Technology Group, the holding company of the Hankook Tire group. He is a son-in-law of former President Lee Myung-bak. (Yonhap)</p>
