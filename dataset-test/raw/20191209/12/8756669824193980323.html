      <p>Aston Martin South Africa has confirmed its <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-aston-martin-dbx-finally-fully-revealed-as-brands-first-suv/">new DBX</a> will be priced from <b>R3,6-million</b> when it launches locally early in 2020. For reference, the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/lamborghini-has-a-new-sa-distributor-check-out-full-pricing/">Lamborghini Urus</a> starts at R3 495 000.</p>
      <p>That pricing means the new DBX will slot into Aston Martin’s local range above the Vantage V8 and Rapide S but below the DBS Superleggera. In the four-strong DB11 line-up, only the V8-powered coupé will be less expensive than the SUV.</p>
      <p>The DBX, which is built at Aston Martin’s new manufacturing facility in Wales, is both the first SUV and the first full five-seater in the British firm’s 106-year history.</p>
      <p>Power comes from a Mercedes-AMG-sourced twin-turbo 4,0-litre V8 shared with the DB11 and Vantage, although here it offers 405 kW and 700 N.m (and a “sound character that is unquestionably Aston Martin”). That’s enough, claims Aston Martin, for a sprint from standstill to 100 km/h in 4,5 seconds and a top speed of 292 km/h.</p>
      <p>A nine-speed torque convertor automatic transmission sends that oomph to all four wheels, while adaptive air suspension combines with a 48 V electric anti-roll control system and electronic adaptive dampers to lend the DBX what Aston terms “a huge breadth of ability”.</p>
      <p>Inside, the British company claims “class-leading” levels of headroom and legroom, as well as 632 litres of boot space. There’s also a full-length glass panoramic roof and frameless door glass, along with full-grain leather trim, plenty of Alcantara and a range of wood, composite and metal veneers.</p>
      <p>In terms of technology, the DBX features a 10,25-inch TFT screen in the centre console as well as a 12,3-inch TFT screen ahead of the driver. Apple CarPlay comes as standard, as does a 360-degree camera system and ambient lighting that offers 64 different colours in two zones.</p>
