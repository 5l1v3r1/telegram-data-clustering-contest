      <p>Members of a gang which was planning a major crime in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> involving guns and Royal Mail uniforms have been jailed for a total of 18 years and three months.</p>
      <p>Ezekial Aremu and Cade Johnston were halted by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> in a dramatic armed swoop outside the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/gun-gang-snared-armed-cops-20868640">Forge shopping centre</a> .</p>
      <p>A third member of the gang Richard Carty was snared at an Airbnb in Springfield Gardens, Glasgow, with two pistols and live ammunition, but claimed he was in the city for a painting and decorating job.</p>
      <p>At the High Court in Glasgow Carty, 38, from Salford, Manchester, Aremu, 21, and Johnson, 21, from Prestwich, Bury, all admitted their part in a conspiracy to become involved in a serious organised crime in Glasgow in March this year.</p>

      <p>Sentencing the three judge Lord Arthurson said: “The targets have not been identified but it must have involved the use of disguises and the use of firearms.”</p>
      <p>Lord Arthurson said all three men were assessed as being at significant risk of re-offending.</p>
      <p>Carty was jailed for six years and six months, Aremu for six years and Johnston for five years and nine months.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Murdo McTaggart said: “The evidence in this case shows that the Carty and Aremu were involved in the planning and preparation for a serious <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/">crime</a> involving the use of a firearm with live ammunition.</p>

      <p>“Aremu's position is that he was not going to be involved in the ultimate use of the weapons.</p>
      <p>“Johnson was involved in the planning and preparation for a serious crime, although it is accepted he was not aware of the presence of the firearms.”</p>
      <p>The court heard that a massive police operation began with police monitoring the movements of the three who stayed at the Airbnb from March 7 into March 8.</p>
      <p>At 12.08pm Aremu and Johnston and another man were stopped by armed police as they drove a grey Mercedes car along East Wellington Street near the Forge shopping centre.</p>

      <p>The occupants were removed from the car at gunpoint and detained. The car contained a balaclava in the passenger footwell, £1,000 of counterfeit £20 notes in the glove boxes and two cans full of petrol were in the boot.</p>
      <p>At 3pm armed police went to the flat in Springfield Gardens where they found Carty.</p>
      <p>He was asked if there were any firearms and replied: “There is maybe something in a bag in there.”</p>
      <p>In the bedroom police found a holdall which contained a Luger pistol and six live cartridges and parts of a Glock pistol.</p>
      <p>Also found were Royal Mail uniforms and bags and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow-city-council">Glasgow City Council</a> hi-vis vests.</p>
      <p>Carty's DNA and Aremu's fingerprints and were found on the holdall and on a box that had been specially adapted to hold a gun.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor McTaggart said: “In one of the Royal Mail bags was a cardboard box addressed to a vets practice at the Forge Retail Park in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“The box had been adapted so that a handgun could be concealed in and readily accessed from it.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The target or targets have not been identified by the police, but the serious crime intended must have involved the use of disguises – a postman and a Glasgow City employee – with the intention of evading security of avoiding suspicion, to enable a place or person to be approached without suspicion.”</p>

      <p>Graham Robertson, defence counsel for Carty said: “My client says he only touched the guns out of curiosity. He initially though he was coming to Glasgow for painting and decorating jobs.”</p>
      <p>Defence counsel for the other two accused claimed that their clients had suspicions, but did not know anything about the actual crime being planned.</p>
