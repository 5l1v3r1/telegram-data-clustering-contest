      <h1>Lizzo's Thong Outfit Draws Comparisons To WWE Wrestler Rikishi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:14:55+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:14</time> by <a rel="author">Yohance Kyles (@HUEYmixwitRILEY)</a></address>
      <p>The onetime Minneapolis resident had her eyes on Karl-Anthony Towns of the T-Wolves.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> "Juice" songstress Lizzo stole the show at the Lake Show on Sunday. The Grammy-nominated performer made waves when she began twerking in a thong during the Lakers-Timberwolves game in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Lizzo's asset-showing outfit quickly spread across social media. Some Twitter users began pointing out the similarities between her black shirt-dress with a whole in the back to the ring attire of professional wrestler Solofa Fatu Jr. (aka Rikishi).</p>
      <p>The WWE Hall of Famer was known for the Stink Face, a move where he sat on the face of his opponents as they were laid out in the corner of the squared circle. Plus, Rikishi had a finisher called The Banzai Drop which also involved his derriere.</p>
      <p>Rikishi's name became a Twitter trending topic on Monday morning. Some of the commenters instantly understood why the father of WWE superstars Jey and Jimmy Uso was getting so much attention, while other users gradually discovered the connection to Lizzo's apparel at the Staples Center.</p>
