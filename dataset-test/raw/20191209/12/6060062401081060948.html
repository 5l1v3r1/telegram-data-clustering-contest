      <p>"Larry and Sergey were visiting Stanford to 'take a trip down memory lane' after stepping down on Tuesday from their roles at Google and Alphabet," <a href="https://twitter.com/jwkritchie/status/1203199158808506368">Ritchie said in a follow-up tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>Page and Brin met in 1995 while working on computer-science Ph.D.s at Stanford and went on to found Google in 1998. The pair announced last week that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alphabet-larry-page-sergey-brin-stepping-down-sundar-pichai-2019-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">they would step down from their roles at Alphabet</a>, Google's parent company â€” but remain <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/sergey-brin/#495817434b43">two</a> of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-page/#56a84de07893">richest</a> people on the planet.</p>
      <p>As it happens, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwkritchie/status/1203199162394669056">Ritchie occupies what used to be Page's office</a>, which Page got after Brin "illicitly" gave him the master key to the building early, allowing him to choose the best desk.</p>
      <p>Ritchie said Page and Brin knocked on his door while he was working late, "on the off chance that there was someone inside," adding that the surprise visit was "an incredibly surreal and amazing experience."</p>
