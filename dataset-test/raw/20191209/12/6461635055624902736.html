      <h3>Barcelona leave some heavy hitters out of their line-up for match against Inter Milan.</h3>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde’s Barcelona is set to field a heavily rotated side in their final Champions League group stage match against Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique and Sergi Roberto were among the names left out of the matchday squad. Arthur Melo, Nelson Semedo  and Jordi Alba are set to miss the match due to injury. Players from the Barça B squad were also added to round-up the final list.</p>
      <p>The club also got a significant boost as Ansu Fati received the <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/football/first-team/news/1524959/the-squad-for-the-trip-to-inter-milan?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=fcbarcelona&amp;utm_campaign=197e9892-565e-4f67-b605-364d5d68e433"><b>medical green light</b></a> and will be back for this match.  Fati missed the match against Mallorca due to discomfort in both his knees.</p>
      <p>For Barcelona, the result of this match will have no effect on their Champions League campaign as they already won their group and advanced to the knockout stage.</p>
      <p>For Inter, this is a must-win as they are battling with Borussia Dortmund for the second spot in the group. An elimination this early in the tournament would be a significant blow both to Inter and Antonio Conte.</p>
      <h4>Expected Starting XI (4-3-3):</h4>
      <p><b>Goalkeeper: </b>Neto<b><br/></b><b>Right-back: </b>Moussa Wague<b><br/></b><b>Centre-back (right): </b>Jean-Clair Todibo<b><br/></b><b>Centre-back (left): </b>Samuel Umtiti<b><br/></b><b>Left-back: </b>Junior Firpo<b><br/></b><b>Central midfielder (right): </b>Arturo Vidal<b><br/></b><b>Defensive midfielder: </b>Ivan Rakitic<b><br/></b><b>Central midfielder (left): </b>Carles Aleña<b><br/></b><b>Right winger: </b>Carles Perez<b><br/></b><b>Center forward: </b>Antoine Griezmann<b><br/></b><b>Left-winger: </b>Ansu Fati</p>
      <p>Neto will be making his first start of the season taking over for Ter Stegen. Defensively, Valverde only has a few options but he could mix-and-match both in midfield and attack.</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez could start given there is no other striker on the team and Riqui Puig could also start in place of Arturo Vidal.</p>
      <p>The last time these two sides faced, Inter Milan dominated the game at the Camp Nou and should have been a couple of goals up at the end of the first-half had they taken advantage of their opportunities.</p>
      <p>Inter did not and Barcelona managed to turn the game around in the second-half.</p>
      <p>With an alternative side and an even more motivated Inter, Ernesto Valverde’s team is going to be put to the test. Despite this being a “meaningless” game, Barcelona should still want to put on a good performance.</p>
