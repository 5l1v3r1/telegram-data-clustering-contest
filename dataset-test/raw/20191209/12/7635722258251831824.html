        <b>Councils are being criticised for not publishing details of any political donations given to their councillors.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A National Integrity Index of all 31 local authorities shows that just 10 are displaying their councillors' political donations or their ethics declarations.</p>
      <p>The Transparency International Ireland research finds Fingal and South Dublin County Councils are the most transparent, while Kerry and Westmeath Councils are the worst performing.</p>
      <p>Their report points to Wexford, Galway County and Kilkenny councils as having seen the biggest improvements.</p>
      <p>Overall, TI Ireland claims too few councils are open with their efforts to tackle the risk of corruption.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the findings, Dr Elliott Jordan-Doak from TI Ireland said it is vital the public knows if their councillors are receiving donations.</p>
      <p>He explained: "Although we did see an improvement overall, we'd like to see more councils post the donations statements and the ethics declarations of councillors - these pieces of information are crucial for ensuring transparency.</p>
      <blockquote>"Basically we want to know that councillors have nothing to hide."</blockquote>
      <p>He added: "We don't have enough money on who is funding councillors - we don't have the donation statements.</p>
      <p>"Of course they're available in person... but, as I said, [putting] them online would be to make the whole process more transparent."</p>
      <p>You can see the full ranking of local authorities below.</p>
