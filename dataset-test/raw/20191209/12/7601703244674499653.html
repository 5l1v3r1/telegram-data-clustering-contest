      <p>"Namaskaar,</p>
      <p>For the past 28 days, I was at Breach Candy hospital...</p>
      <p>I was diagnosed with pneumonia. The doctors preferred that I extend my stay in the hospital and go home when completely healthy.</p>
      <p>Today, I am back home with the blessings of Mai and Baba I have my deepest gratitude to all my well-wishers all over. Your prayers and good wishes have worked and I humbly bow down to each one of you.</p>
      <p>My doctors at Breach Candy have been my guardian angels and I stand in eternal gratitude to each one of them. The nursing staff has been exceptional. A special thank you to the team of doctors who treated me with the utmost care and love... Dr. Pratit Samdani, Dr. Ashwin Mehta, Dr. Zareer Udwadia, Dr. Nishit Shah, Dr. Janardan Nimbolkar and Dr. Rajeev Sharma. Your endless love and blessings are precious. Thank you, again!" (sic)</p>
