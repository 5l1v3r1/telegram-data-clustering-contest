      <h1>Aston Villa fans criticise John McGinn’s performance in home defeat versus Leicester</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder was not on top of his game in the 4-1 defeat.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:15:17+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa were comfortably beaten 4-1 by fellow Midlands club Leicester City at Villa Park yesterday as Brendan Rodgers’ side continued their winning run.</p>
      <p>It’s now a club-record eight in a row for the Foxes and after a promising opening spell, the hosts fell away and slipped to a heavy defeat.</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish was the only player who looked capable of making things happen, scoring Villa’s goal right on half time and taking on the creative burden.</p>
      <p>John McGinn was his midfield partner in crime in the engine room last season and at the start of this campaign, but the Scotland international is struggling now.</p>

      <p>Some fans on Twitter felt that the midfielder is simply tired and needs a rest, having been an ever-present for club and country this season.</p>
      <p>Both others speculated that he has started to believe his own hype after an impressive start to the season or that his game has been found out slightly at the higher level.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith faces a big call over whether to rest him as he searches for the right balance in midfield, but any criticism of Villa’s recent run should take into account that they’ve played three top sides – two away from home – in the past week.</p>
