      <p>A scene both thrilling and disturbing in equal parts on a busy road at Koregaon Park junction in Pune, Maharashtra, has been captured in a video (above).</p>
      <p>In a chase lasting almost half a kilometre, a pair of horses drawing a carriage can be seen speeding down the Bund Garden Bridge, with three men on a single motorcycle in pursuit.</p>
      <p>What followed was almost out of a film, with the horses being stopped, but one of the riders being injured. According to <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/chariot-in-pune-goes-out-of-control-charioteer-rides-triples-on-bike.html">reports</a>, Jitendra Kadam suffered minor internal injuries in his abdomen and on his hands.</p>
      <p>“There were no other injuries or damage caused by the incident,” the Koregaon police has stated. However, the condition of the horses is yet unknown.</p>
