      <p>R Kelly’s former manager<b> </b>Demetrius Smith is set to testify about the singer’s controversial marriage to Aaliyah.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/nyregion/rkelly-aaliyah.html?action=click&amp;module=Latest&amp;pgtype=Homepage">New York Times</a>, R Kelly, real name Robert Kelly, is set to be prosecuted for bribery after he reportedly obtained a fake ID in 1994 for an underage girl named only in court documents as Jane Doe.</p>
      <p>However, it is believed to be Aaliyah that is referenced as the unknown woman in the documents given the timing of the alleged offence.</p>

      <p>The alleged incident occurred just one day before the then 27-year-old married then 15-year-old singer Aaliyah.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/09/r-kelly-aaliyah-marriage-indictment-allegation-demetrius-smith-fake-id-testify-trial-prison/">TMZ,</a> Demetrius said that he will stand by revelations he made in his 2011 book The Man Behind the Man: Looking from the Inside Out – that R.Kelly’s team obtained a fake ID for Aaliyah so that he could marry the underage teen.</p>
      <p>“I wrote the story 10 years ago about the documents and all that stuff and it was known back then and all of its coming out now but it’s after the fact,” he explained.</p>
      <p>The music manager also spoke about the fake ID while giving an interview for the Lifetime documentary Surviving R.Kelly which detailed the many sexual abuse allegations against the Ignition singer.</p>

      <p>The couple’s marriage was later annulled, and Aaliyah later died in 2001 aged 22.</p>
      <p>Conscious of the fact the Aaliyah is not here to speak for herself, Demetrius said he doesn’t want to bring her into the conversation.</p>
      <p>“Aaliyah is not here, and I really don’t wanna bring her back up in this.”</p>
      <p>He also said that her family knew about the incident at the time and didn’t wish to pursue the matter any further.</p>

      <p>“Her parents didn’t want to have nothing done. I wanna help out I wanna be used as a witness to… I told them when they interviewed me that I wrote it and if you read it then I have to stand on my words.”</p>
      <p>“But I don’t wanna use the words to prosecute Robert Kelly.”</p>
      <p>Demetrius also said he didn’t think R. Kelly, real name Robert Kelly, to be prosecuted.</p>
      <p>“I don’t wanna be used as a witness to hurt Robert Kelly.”</p>
      <p>“I think Robert should get a psych evaluation that’s what I think and from there that’s where we should help him more so than hurt him.”</p>
