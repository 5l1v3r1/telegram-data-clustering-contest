      <p>Since the unveiling of the <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/12/08/elon-musk-spotted-driving-teslas-new-cybertruck-electric-pickup-la/">Cybertruck</a>, we couldn't stop talking about it for a minute and there's almost nothing bigger than that right now.</p>
      <p>The Tesla CEO Elon Musk, said earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-la-sighting-elon-musk-driving-video/">Cybertruck</a> is his favorite next product. It must be indeed his favorite that he was seen on Saturday evening driving the stainless steel <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/video/why-does-cybertruck-look-like-the-way-it-does-actually">Cybertruck</a> in Los Angeles. He drove with his world-famous, cool-looking car to Nobu restaurant in Malibu with several of his friends.</p>

      <p>Not a lot of the features of the new <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/video/explanation-to-why-cybertruck-pulling-an-f-150-video-wasnt-accurate">Cybertruck</a> was illustrated, the only feature clearly seemed was the camera-based digital rear-view "mirror."</p>
      <p>Of course, this time no one threw metal balls to the truck, instead, everyone seemed to be really interested in the truck and took photos of it. Actor Edward Norton was one of the people who paid special attention to the vehicle.</p>
      <p>The same day, someone else spotted Elon Musk's Cybertruck near LAX.</p>

      <p>On December 7, Roberto Cruz shared a video on Youtube a Cybertruck prototype on the 405 highway, with the title of "Tesla truck cybertruck on 405 s FW, Dec 7th at 11pm. Ford F-150 moves out the way. Elon Musk driving."</p>

      <p>We've seen a couple of Cybertruck on the road for now, and we can't wait until it'll be released to the market so we can see more!</p>
