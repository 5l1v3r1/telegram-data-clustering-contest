      <h3>Jean-Clair Todibo has been touted as a potential Superstar but ever since his arrival at Camp Nou, the youngster has struggled to find enough play-time.</h3>
      <p>As per <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/12/09/ac-milan-hold-meeting-with-barcelona-as-they-consider-swoop-for-e10m-rated-starlet/"><b>Caught Offside</b></a>, AC Milan and Barcelona have initiated talks regarding the sale of Jean-Clair Todibo to AC Milan. The 19 year-old hasn’t been able to feature in the playing XI on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>The defender has made only 4 appearances this year and hence, hasn’t been able to develop as much as the defending La Liga champions would’ve wanted him to. Moreover, he has Samuel Umtiti sitting ahead of him who is ready to take over from either of Pique or Clement Langlet.</p>
      <p>Todibo is valued at £10 million and Barcelona are looking to include a buy-back clause in case Todibo does live up to his potential. For the time being, however, it does seem as if this move is in the best interest of both the parties involved.</p>
      <p>The squad is set to undergo a major overhaul and the Catalans do have quite a few targets on their radar. One must note the fact that these are high value targets can prove to be long-term prospects for the club. With the current defense set-up, a place for Jean-Clair looks highly unlikely.</p>
      <p>Valverde will need to decide if they want to keep Pique’s long-term replacement with them or send him on a potential loan-deal where he is almost guaranteed a place in the playing XI. Only time will tell if this deal is going to materialise or not.</p>
