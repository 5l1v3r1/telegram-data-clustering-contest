      <p>'Listen, I’ve drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip,' she told fellow presenter Jamie Theakston. </p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/"><b>The Sun,</b></a> Insiders previously revealed that Holden believed he scuppered her chances of filling in on This Morning during her absence in November and December 2018.  </p>
      <p>It's understood that she headed to the top by lobbying ITV executives over the animosity after he allegedly pushed for former Saturdays star Rochelle Humes to take the job.</p>
      <p>A former daytime TV executive told the publication: 'Phillip actively campaigned for Rochelle Humes to get the job despite Amanda being more experienced - and having been told privately she’d got the gig.'</p>

        <figcaption>On-screen chemistry: The coveted role eventually went to former Saturdays star Rochelle Humes</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And addressing the host on Heart Radio in June, Amanda alluded to a rift when revealing the three things things she wouldn't like to find in her home, flippantly telling fans: 'Spiders, flies and Phillip Schofield.’</p>
      <p>Phillip has since been feuding with other This Morning co-stars and the atmosphere behind the scenes has turned 'toxic', according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/"><b>The Sun</b></a>.</p>
      <p>He is said to be at the centre of a 'civil war' at the ITV programme amid claims his attitude has impacted his professional relationships with his colleagues, including Ruth and Holly.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/09/13/21955312-7772133-Allegation_Phillip_been_accused_of_creating_a_toxic_atmosphere_o-a-14_1575897304837.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Allegation: Phillip been accused of creating a 'toxic atmosphere' on the set of the ITV show, with claims of ongoing feuds with Holly and stand-in hosts Ruth and Eamonn</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It is claimed that eight different ITV presenters have broken their silence about the situation, while the show's Friday presenter Ruth, 59, is said to have made an official complaint.</p>
      <p>However, an ITV spokesperson has strongly refuted the 'disappointing allegations, saying they are simply 'malicious gossip'.</p>
      <p>The denial comes after a report stated the situation behind the scenes at This Morning had become 'toxic' in recent months, with employees too scared to speak out publicly for fear of backlash.</p>

        <figcaption>Rumours: Tensions reportedly rose when Ruth and Phillip spoke over each other while doing a live preview of Loose Women in April</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>An ITV source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/"><b>The Sun</b></a>: 'For so long people have been silenced because they are scared for their job. If they speak out publicly about the atmosphere they fear there could be repercussions.'</p>
      <p>A insider close to Holly told the paper: 'It’s true there have been some issues. They’re like brothers and sisters - they have ups and downs but love each other.'</p>
      <p>Hitting back at the reports, however, a spokesperson for ITV said: 'It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip. </p>

        <figcaption>Missing: Holly shared a snap form the This Morning Christmas party on Instagram in which regular Friday hosts Ruth and Eamonn were nowhere to be seen</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise.</p>
      <p>'Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike.'</p>
      <p>Martin Frizell, Editor of This Morning said: 'I spend hundreds of days a year in their company and what you see is what you get, a genuine friendship from a couple who are both spontaneously funny and professional.</p>
      <p>'We have the smartest viewers watching telly and believe me they would be the first to notice any issues - they haven’t because there are none.'</p>

        <figcaption>Rumoured rift: To make matters worse, Phillip is reported to have been furious at Holly (pictured with Declan Donnelly in a promotional picture) for landing a lead presenting role on last years I’m A Celebrity while Ant McPartlin recovered from alcohol issues</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Mail on Sunday revealed that relations on set are so bad, Ruth and husband Eamonn Holmes snubbed the show’s <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/christmas/index.html"><b>Christmas</b></a> party to avoid Phillip, after a series of behind-the-scenes rows, with the silver-maned ITV stalwart being described as ‘rude’.</p>
      <p>Ruth and Eamonn host the Friday episode of This Morning and sit in for other presenters’ holidays, but were surprisingly absent last week from the no-expense-spared dinner at a West London restaurant where 23 of their colleagues enjoyed a four-course meal and champagne to celebrate the holiday season.</p>
      <p>The tension between Ruth and Phillip stems from April when they spoke over each other while she was doing a live preview of Loose Women, which she also hosts. </p>
      <p>As he cut her off abruptly, saying: ‘We’re a bit tight for time at this end,’ she retorted: ‘I only had about two more words to say, don’t worry.’</p>

        <figcaption>Opening up: The presenter addressed the issue while hosting her daily show alongside Jamie Theakston </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Since then, it seems relations between Phillip, Ruth and a protective Eamonn have only deteriorated.</p>
      <p>The rift is causing anxiety at YMU, the agency formerly known as James Grant, which represents all four.</p>
      <p>It is also understood that Phillip is playing down Ruth’s grievance over being cut off by insisting it was the fault of the show’s production team. </p>
      <p>A source revealed: ‘There are an increasing number of presenters who say that when the cameras aren’t running the atmosphere is toxic.</p>
      <p>‘Phillip is a man with high standards, he has survived a long time in the TV world. There has been an almighty clash. There is currently one household name on ITV daytime who refers to him as “the c***”.’</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Phillip, who joined This Morning in 2002, is also said to be envious that Eamonn, 60, was given an OBE last year for services to broadcasting. </p>
      <p>Despite the controversy, Phillip has taken to Twitter to thank fans for voting for This Morning to win an I Talk Telly award - seemingly ignoring the recent rumours about him causing a 'toxic' atmosphere on set.</p>
      <p>The presenter posted the video with the simple caption 'Thank You', in which he gushes about his and Willoughby's fans, accepting the award for the fifth consecutive year. </p>
      <p>MailOnline contacted a representative for further comment at the time.</p>
