      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:21:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Louis Vuitton's <i>League of Legends</i> <a href="https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/lvxlol/discover-the-collection/lvxlol-the-collection/_/N-yyd2rt/to-3">apparel line</a> is here, and as you'd expect, it is expensive. On the lower end, there's a <a href="https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/products/lvxlol-short-sleeve-t-shirt-nvprod2000053v">$670 t-shirt</a> with <i>League of Legends </i>champion Qiyana on the front and back. On the other end of the spectrum, you can nab a <a href="https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/products/lvxlol-leather-biker-jacket-nvprod2000039v">$5,650 leather biker jacket</a> or a <a href="https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/products/lvxlol-zip-up-hoodie-nvprod2000049v">$2,420 hoodie</a>.</p>

      <p>All of the apparel and accessories (there's a $515 keychain and bag charm) combine the iconic LV pattern with the brand's take on a <i>League of Legends</i> color palette. Several items have a tiger-stripe design. As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/9/21002716/louis-vuitton-league-of-legends-collab-drop-clothing-hoodie-price"><i>Polygon</i></a> points out, there isn't a direct connection between the pattern and the game, but it gives the line a consistent feel.</p>

      <p>As we've noted before, this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/23/louis-vuitton-league-of-legends-trophy-case/">isn't an entirely surprising collaboration</a>. It could help both Riot Games and Louis Vuitton reach audiences they wouldn't otherwise. Louis Vuitton already makes apparel for traditional sports, like its <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/5/louis-vuitton-fifa-2018-world-cup-leather-accessories">FIFA line</a>, and now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/21/how-the-traditional-sports-world-is-embracing-esports/">eSports have gone mainstream</a>, this isn't a huge leap. The prices might seem high to the uninitiated, but they're in line with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/29/louis-vuitton-tambour-horizon-snapdragon-wear-3100/">price of other Louis Vuitton goods</a>, and clearly, there's a market for those.</p>
