      <h1>SBI lowers MCLR based lending rates by 10 bps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:28:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Country's largest lender State Bank of India on Monday announced the reduction in its marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points across all one-year products, effective Tuesday.</p>
      <p>This is the eighth consecutive cut in MCLR by the lender this fiscal.</p>
      <p>"To pass on the benefit of our falling cost of funds to customers, we have reduced MCLR by 10 bps across all tenors," a statement from the bank said.</p>
      <p>The new one-year MCLR has been cut to 7.90 per cent from 8 per cent.</p>
      <p>The reduction comes as the Reserve Bank in a surprise move left the key policy rates unchanged last Thursday at 5.15 per cent.</p>
