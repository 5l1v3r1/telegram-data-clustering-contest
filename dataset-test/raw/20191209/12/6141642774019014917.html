      <h1>Will States relax the rules on busking?</h1>
      <h2>STREET entertainers will be allowed to use amplifiers while performing if proposals to relax Jersey’s busking laws are approved by the States this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:35:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Heath</a></address>
      <p>Deputy Montfort Tadier’s proposition, which is due to be debated, would also see the permit fee for buskers waived as well as the requirement removed for them to donate all of their December earnings to charity.</p>
      <p>The move is intended to improve the quality of street entertainment in Jersey.</p>
      <p>Members are also due to debate another proposition lodged by the backbencher which calls for an additional bank holiday on 28 September to be introduced each year from 2021 onwards in Jersey, marking the anniversary of the Corn Riots.</p>
      <p>The proposals call for up to £10,000 to also be set aside to fund celebrations and entertainment each year in commemoration of the event, which took place in 1769 and prompted reforms of Jersey’s parliament to make it more democratic.</p>
      <p>External Relations Minister Ian Gorst has also lodged a proposition, which, if approved, would allow distributions to be made from the Jersey Reclaim Fund, which was established by the Dormant Bank Accounts Law in 2017.</p>
      <p>During the last two years, the fund has gathered £16 million in funds from disused bank accounts that could be distributed towards charitable and social causes.</p>
      <p>In question time, Senator Kristina Moore is due to ask Education Minister Tracey Vallois how she intends to deliver planned savings in her department of £1.78 million under the government’s efficiencies plan. And Deputy Kevin Pamplin is due to ask Senator Vallois what measures are being taken to ensure that canteen food in Jersey’s schools is healthy and affordable for all students.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Deputy Geoff Southern plans to ask Health Minister Richard Renouf what action is being taken to improve access to primary care for vulnerable Islanders under the Jersey Care Model.</p>
      <p>The backbencher’s proposals to set aside £0.9 million in the Government Plan to reduce GP fees for groups such as pensioners and young children were rejected by the States last week.</p>
      <p>External Relations Minister Ian Gorst and Social Security Minister Susie Pinel are due to be grilled for 15 minutes each during questions without notice.</p>
