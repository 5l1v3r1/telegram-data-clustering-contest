      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:45:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Beijing hopes that it can reach a trade agreement with the United States that satisfies both sides as soon as possible, China's Assistant Commerce Minister Ren Hongbin said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Ren made the remarks during a press briefing in the Chinese capital.</p>
      <p>China and the United States are negotiating a so-called "phase one" deal aimed at de-escalating the prolonged trade dispute, but it is unclear whether such an agreement can be reached in the near term.</p>
      <p>Washington's next round of tariffs against Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15.</p>
