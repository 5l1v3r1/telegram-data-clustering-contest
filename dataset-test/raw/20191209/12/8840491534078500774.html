      <p>THINK like Santa and don't put the presents under the tree until Christmas – that's the advice of Superintendent Joe McKenna.</p>
      <p>With many homes having valuables bought as presents at this time of the year, the Supt. advised they should not be put on public display in our homes for would-be burglars.</p>
      <p>“People will have presents under the tree, but don't put them out. Don't come until Christmas morning, like Santa.”</p>
      <p>Supt. McKenna's festive advice also warned against keeping cash in your home. Cash, he pointed out, is not identifiable – if you catch a person down the road you can't identify the money on them as being yours.</p>
      <p>The superintendent's advice for the business community is to keep an eye out for scams coming via fake emails where the name looks like someone they do business with who is looking for an immediate transfer of money.</p>
      <p>Businesses, he said, need to have a system of checks because if you transfer money it will be gone in a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>“If you get a bill looking for immediate payment, check it out immediately. Ring the company. Do not send money until you have checked it out,” was the advice.</p>
      <p>Online shoppers, too, need to be aware – if something sounds too good to be true it probably is and he advised that money should not be paid over until you have the goods in your hands.</p>
      <p>He had seen people get caught out with tickets and tractors – he saw one tractor sold three or four times on one particular website.</p>
      <p>And closer to home again, the supt. asked people to keep an eye out for elderly relatives and neighbours at this time of year.</p>
      <p>Supt. McKenna, at a meeting of Mayo's Joint Policing Committee, said there have been 160 burglaries in the county so far this year – down 25 on last year. Normal theft numbers are 199 – a reduction of 45, while thefts from shops are 307 – up 32.</p>
