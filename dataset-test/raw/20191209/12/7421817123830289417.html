      <p>The head of Russia's anti-doping agency said Monday that his country had "no chance" of winning an appeal against a four-year international sporting ban he said was a tragedy for clean athletes.</p>
      <p>"There is no chance of winning this case in court," Rusada chief Yury Ganus told AFP after the World Anti-Doping Agency imposed the ban that will rule Russia out of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Rusada's supervisory board is set to meet on December 19 to take a decision on whether to appeal the ban, he said.</p>
      <p>"This is a tragedy," he said. "Clean athletes are seeing their rights limited."</p>
      <p>Ganus said that some Russian athletes were contemplating leaving Russia so that they could train elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He described the sentiments among athletes as "awful," stressing that four years for a sportsman is a long time in what can be a short career.</p>
      <p>Earlier Monday Wada's executive committee, meeting in Lausanne, decided that Russia be handed a four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory data.</p>
      <p>Russian athletes have already faced a series of bans over the last few years and were forced to participate in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games as neutral competitors.</p>
      <p>The heads of several Russian sports federations said they were preparing to send athletes to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>The head of Russia's swimming federation, Vladimir Salnikov, said the country's athletes "must go to the Olympics whatever the situation."</p>
      <p>"Of course we'd prefer that our athletes participate under the Russian flag and hear their national anthem. But the circumstances may be different... (and) no-one has the right to deprive innocent athletes of their dreams," he told state news agency RIA Novosti.</p>
      <p>"If (participating under a neutral flag) is the only possibility, we must go and win. Our clean athletes, I am sure, will show that they are strong, even in these circumstances," said the head of the waterpolo, diving and synchronised swimming federation, Alexei Vlasenko.</p>
