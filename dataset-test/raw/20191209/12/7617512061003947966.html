      <p>A man who barricaded himself inside a Victoria synagogue for four hours Monday morning was eventually apprehended by police under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>Victoria police Const. Matt Rutherford said the man suffered “non-life-threatening injuries,” but police were unable to say how they occurred.</p>
      <p>The man could face possible mischief charges for allegedly breaking some items in the building, Rutherford said.</p>
      <p>“He allegedly committed a criminal offence, but right now we’re worried for his own welfare.”</p>
      <p>Police first responded to reports of an unwanted male at Congregation Emanu-El, at Blanshard Street and Pandora Avenue, just after 8:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>The first officers on the scene encountered a man experiencing a mental health crisis, Rutherford said. As a precautionary measure, police called in the emergency response team and began negotiating with the man, who had barricade himself in a room on the second floor.</p>
      <p>A daycare in the building was safely evacuated and the children taken to another location without injury.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Harry Brechner said the man pushed his way into the synagogue.</p>
      <p>“He was clearly dealing with severe mental health issues,” he said. “It took the police quite a while to safely get him out of the building.”</p>
      <p>Brechner said there was a bit of damage as a result of the incident.</p>
      <p>“Some of it’s going to be probably pricey because it’s very old things like stained glass windows, but nothing that can’t be fixed.”</p>
