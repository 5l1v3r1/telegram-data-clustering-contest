      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- The New York Knicks have fired head coach David Fizdale, a league source told ESPN.</p>
      <p>The team has also dismissed assistant Keith Smart, a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28238796/sources-knicks-fire-david-fizdale-8th-straight-loss">league source told ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>The Knicks lost their eighth straight game with a 129-92 defeat to the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night in which they trailed by as many as 43 points in the fourth quarter. That came on the heels of a 44-point loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
      <p>Fizdale called the team's effort against the Nuggets "sickening."</p>
      <p>At 4-18, the Knicks have the worst record in the Eastern Conference and are tied for the worst record through 22 games in franchise history.</p>
      <p>Fizdale chose the Knicks over several other offers in 2018 -- including Atlanta, Charlotte and Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Knicks assistants Mike Miller and Pat Sullivan are candidates to become interim head coach, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.</p>
