      <p>Cape Town - Suriname's <b>Jairzinho Rozenstruik</b> claimed a shock TKO victory over Dutch star <b>Alister Overeem</b> in the dying seconds of their heavyweight UFC bout on Sunday.</p>
      <p>According to the <b>Stuff <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/combat-sports/118043504/ufc-star-alistair-overeems-lip-explodes-in-gruesome-late-ko-to-jairzinho-rozenstruik">website</a></b>, it wasn't so much the upset that made headlines around the world, but rather the devastating injury suffered by Overeem.</p>
      <p>With just 11 seconds left on the clock in the fifth and final round, Rozenstruik landed a right hook flush on Overeem's mouth, ripping open his top lip and exposing his teeth underneath.</p>
      <p>The exploding action of his lip tearing apart was enough to leave even the most hardened of fight fans wincing as social media went into meltdown.</p>
      <p>Unbelievably, Overeem managed to get back to his feet after the blow, but the referee had seen enough, ending the fight by way of TKO with four seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>It was an unfortunate turn of events for Overeem who was likely to win the fight on points had it lasted a few more seconds.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Alistairovereem">Twitter</a> so provide a medical update - and to bemoan what he believed was a fast stoppage.</p>
