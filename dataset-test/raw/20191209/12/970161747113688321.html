      <p>Remember the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/04/83-year-old-grandma-loves-using-tinder-to-find-younger-men-for-casual-sex-10682376/">sex-positive grandma we had no choice but to stan?</a></p>
      <p>83-year-old gran Hattie ‘Retroage’ delighted us with the tales of her sexual conquests and how she has no time for old grandfatherly types.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two and grandmother-of-three, divorced in her 50s and has spent nearly 30 years on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> scene.</p>
      <p>Obviously, as a singleton in New York, she joined Tinder, choosing exclusively to date younger men.</p>
      <p>Despite all the success with casual sex and flings, Hattie now wants to find the one. She is tired of meaningless sex and hopes to find love again, like what she had with her former husband.</p>
      <p>‘I’m a cougar by default,’ she says. ‘Each time I would have wanted one of the men to say, “I can’t live without you, this is so great”.</p>
      <p>‘My former husband said that, but nobody else has said it yet.’</p>
      <p>Still, whoever she eventually settles down with has to be at least 20 years younger. And of course, an active sex life is a prerequisite to the relationship.</p>
      <p>She adds: ‘What I would desire from my life is a partner – one that’s turned on by me, and I’m turned on by him. So I want a man, I would guess that’s 60.’</p>

      <p>After being such a prolific dater, Hattie’s decision to find one man has surprised people around her.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Sometimes people say “don’t you want variety? If you only had one man, would that be good enough?”</p>
      <p>‘It’s not that I need variety, I need frequency, so if you have one man, you always have a dick in bed with you or wherever it’s going to be.</p>
      <p>‘I really want that steady sexuality, I had that when I was married, but if it isn’t happening, it isn’t happening.’</p>

      <p>Even when she signed up to Tinder, Hattie was hoping to start a relationship rather than a series of one night stands.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘I was not visualizing myself as just a one-night stand but I ended up that way by default.</p>
      <p>‘A man would be attracted to me and me to him, and we would meet, have a drink, then if we were interested in each other, more specifically if I was interested in them, I bring them to the apartment and we’d make love.</p>
      <p>‘But I’ve noticed that if a guy really gets into me, he wants to leave, because he did not expect the 83-year-old to be what I am.’</p>

      <p>Signing herself up to more traditional dating websites Hattie is hopeful she can meet that special someone.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I learned a lot from Tinder. You learn a lot about who you really are.</p>
      <p>‘What I learned is that men are people instead of potential hard dicks or orgasm givers or g-spot geniuses.</p>
      <p>‘But finally, I said, look, I can’t just keep saying yes to what I don’t really want, I really want one man.’</p>
      <p>Good luck, Hattie.</p>
