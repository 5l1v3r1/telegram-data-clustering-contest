      <p>MOSCOW: The head of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Russia">Russia</a>'s anti-doping agency said on Monday that his country had "no chance" of winning an appeal against a four-year international sporting ban he said was a tragedy for clean athletes.</p>
      <p>"There is no chance of winning this case in court," RUSADA chief <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Yury-Ganus">Yury Ganus</a> said after the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Anti-Doping-Agency">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> imposed the ban.</p>
      <p>RUSADA's supervisory board is set to meet on December 19 to take a decision on whether to appeal the ban, he said.</p>
      <p>"This is a tragedy," he said. "Clean athletes are seeing their rights limited."</p>
      <p>Ganus said that some Russian athletes were contemplating leaving Russia so that they could train elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He described the sentiments among athletes as "awful," stressing that four years for a sportsman is a long time.</p>
      <p>Earlier Monday <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/WADA">WADA</a>'s executive committee, meeting in Lausanne, decided that Russia be handed a four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory data.</p>
