      <p>The Edinburgh Fringe is the world’s biggest <a href="https://www.timeoutsharjah.com/culture">arts</a> festival, with hundreds of thousands of people flocking to the <a href="https://www.timeoutsharjah.com/travel">Scottish city</a> every August.</p>
      <p>And now Sharjah will be hosting its own version of the event in January 2020.<br/><br/>From January 16 until February 1, 2020, there will be more than 600 shows going on across the emirate.</p>
      <p>The key areas for the Sharjah Fringe event will be the Al Majaz Waterfront, Al Qasba and Al Noor Island, where you’ll find plenty of performers.</p>
      <p>The Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq) and Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority (SCTDA) are presenting the festival.</p>
      <p>Ahmed Al Qaseer, COO of Shurooq, told our sister publication Arabian Business, “By bringing Fringe to Sharjah, we want to send a message that ours is ‘a city of choice’.</p>
      <p>“Through Fringe, we want the 200-plus nationalities residing in the UAE to connect with the global language of arts. At the same time, we build bridges with other cultures.”</p>
