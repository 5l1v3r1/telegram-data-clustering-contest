      <p>French striker Maupay hit the winner at Arsenal on Thursday and struck again during Sunday's 2-2 draw with Wolves.</p>
      <p>The former Brentford frontman now has six goals for the season and is hungry for more.</p>
      <p>"To score two goals in a week is a good feeling," he told the club website. "We had a great win on Thursday, but unfortunately we didn't get the three points on Sunday, so we need to keep believing in ourselves.</p>
      <p>"We are a good team as well, with good players, so we need to keep working hard. Personally, as it's my first season in the Premier League, I'm still trying to settle in.</p>
      <p>"I am doing OK, with six goals so far, but I can do more. I am working hard every day to become a better player, and score more goals.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully I will be able to do that and help the team get more wins."</p>
      <p>Maupay cancelled out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diogo-jota/"><b>Diogo Jota</b></a>'s opener with a clinical first-time volley, before Davy Propper's header gave Brighton the lead.</p>
      <p>However, Jota struck again before half-time to secure a point for Wolves and stretch their unbeaten run to 11 matches.</p>
      <p>Jota, who had previously gone nine matches without scoring, told Wolves' website: "I'm always looking to get the goal or an assist to help the team.</p>
      <p>"I am doing my best, but I wasn't scoring. I think Sunday, with two goals, it was a good moment for me, but I'd switch those goals for the victory if that was possible."</p>
