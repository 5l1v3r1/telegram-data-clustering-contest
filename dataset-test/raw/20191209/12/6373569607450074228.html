      <p>There are not believed to be any more survivors following a major volcano eruption on an island in New Zealand earlier today.</p>
      <p>Five people have already been confirmed dead <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/health/new-zealand-volcano-eruption-leaves-3622189">with dozens still missing</a> - 23 people were rescued from the island on tour boats following the eruption.</p>
      <p>A number of people are missing and believed dead, but it is too dangerous for rescuers to to set foot on White Island because it is covered in ash and volcanic debris.</p>
      <p>No signs of life were observed when police, rescue and military aircraft <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/health/new-zealand-volcano-eruption-leaves-3622189">made repeated flights over the scene</a> following Monday afternoon's explosion, which came just days after a warning from experts.</p>
      <p>The search for bodies will not begin until at least Tuesday morning after sunrise, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-new-zealand-volcano-no-21056987">reports the Mirror.</a></p>

      <p>Tour boats helped to rescue 23 people from the island in the immediate aftermath of the eruption, which happened while tourists were walking in and near to the crater just after 2pm local time.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath, one expert described New Zealand's most active cone volcano as a disaster waiting to happen and questioned why visitors were still allowed on the island despite the risks.</p>
      <p>Of the 23 who were rescued, five died and the remaining 18 were injured, including some with severe burns. The dead are said to be a "range of nationalities".</p>

      <p>One of the those killed was a man who worked as a tour guide for a company based in Whakatane, located across from the island on the Bay of Plenty.</p>
      <p>Police said less than 50 people, including New Zealanders and foreign tourists, were on White Island when the volcano erupted.</p>
      <p>It is understood that some of them were on a day trip from the Ovation of the Seas - the world's 12th largest cruise ship - and more than 20 were tourists from Australia.</p>
      <p>The cruise ship is docked at Tauranga, on the North Island, on a cruise that began in Sydney last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Survivors were left covered in ash as they waited to be rescued by boats, including a small dinghy, at the water's edge as an ash cloud billowed 12,000ft into the air and volcanic debris rained down.</p>
      <p>Several people with burn injuries were brought by helicopter to Whakatane, the nearest town on on the mainland.</p>
      <p>The death toll is expected to rise once it is safe enough for search teams to go onto the island, also known by its MƒÅori name, Whakaari.</p>
      <p>Deputy police commissioner John Tims told a news conference: "The physical environment is unsafe for us to return.</p>
      <p>"It is a no-fly zone at the moment."</p>
