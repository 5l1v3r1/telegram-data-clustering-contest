      <p>PEEKSKILL, Westchester County (WABC) -- Flames tore through an apartment complex in Westchester County.</p>
      <p>The four-story building was under construction when the fire broke out Sunday night in Peekskill.</p>
      <p>Firefighters battled the fire for more than eight hours off of Crompound Road.</p>
      <p>Firefighters used their ladder trucks to put water on the building early Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The Assistant fire chief says the building was completely engulfed in flames when they responded just after 10 p.m.</p>
      <p>They had trouble initially getting water on the building as there were no nearby hydrants, so they called in tanker trucks.</p>
      <p>But, the building was already gone. It took less than an hour before it burned to the ground.</p>
      <p>"This is one of the worst fires I've seen in Peekskill in five or six years," said Assistant Chief Mike Sniffen," Peekskill Fire Department. "Yorktown came with tankers; we had departments from all over. We've got Ossining covering houses. On location, we had at least 150 firefighters."</p>
      <p>It was set to be a senior living complex with 52 units under construction.</p>
      <p>The building was made of mostly wood, sending embers flying around, leaving neighbors nearby fearful that it might spread.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there were no injuries.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
