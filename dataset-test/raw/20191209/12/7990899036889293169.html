      <p>House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member <b>Doug Collins</b> (R-Georgia, 9th District) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/01/politics/doug-collins-adam-schiff-testify-house-judiciary-impeachment/index.html">called</a> on Schiff to testify in the ongoing impeachment hearing against President <b>Donald Trump</b>. Collins wanted Schiff to talk about the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment report, but Schiff said no because “There is nothing to testify about.”</p>
      <p>“I think if the President or his allies in the Senate persist it means they are not serious about what they are doing,” Schiff said in a December 1 episode of CNN’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/01/politics/doug-collins-adam-schiff-testify-house-judiciary-impeachment/index.html"><i>State of the Union</i></a>. “What would I offer in terms of testimony that I heard Dr. [Fiona] Hill in open hearing say such and such? That is not pertinent. The only reason for them to go through with this is to mollify the President and that is not a good reason to try to call a member of Congress as a witness.”</p>
      <p>House Judiciary Chairman <b>Jerrold Nadler </b>(D-New York, 10th District) denied Collins’s request for a subpoena of Schiff and other potential witnesses.</p>
