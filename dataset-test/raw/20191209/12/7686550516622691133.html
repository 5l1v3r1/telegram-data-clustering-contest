      <h2>The powerful techniques were deployed by a qualified hypnotist and the results caught on camera</h2>

      <p>Eight people who hated the yeasty toast topper Marmite have been converted to loving the divisive spread thanks to hypnosis.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Marmite set out to find the nation's 10 biggest Marmite haters and see if they could be brought across to the other side.</p>
      <p>In a newly released video, the results of the hypnosis experiment are showcased as eight of ten participants (80%) walked away lovers of the savoury spread.</p>
      <p>The brand received more than 3,000 applications when it announced entries for the unique mind control experience, which aimed to leave participants a fan of the savoury spread and encourage them to broaden their breakfast horizons, ditching sugar-filled alternatives.</p>
      <p>Marmite invited the selected group of haters to London to watch a powerful hypnosis film – under strictly controlled conditions.</p>

      <p>The experiment was conducted and overseen by professional hypnotist, hypnotherapy trainer and best-selling author, Rory Z Fulcher and begins as the haters definitively confessed their distaste for the spread, claiming it’s “the worst thing I’ve ever tasted.”</p>
      <p>Edd Edmondson, 40 from London said his reason for applying was he wanted to “cut down on the sugary spreads”, whilst Andy Bushman, 41 from Bedford said that he’d love to enjoy the toast topper with his Marmite-obsessed son.</p>
      <p>The participants went on to watch a 15-minute video created by Rory Z. Marmite says the film is so powerful it cannot be released to the general public and features a series of mind control techniques designed to change taste perceptions.</p>
      <p>Once complete, the participants are presented with hot, butter and Marmite-smothered crumpets to deliver their final verdict on whether the experiment has worked.</p>

      <p>Seven participants saw the immediate effect of the hypnosis, and the video shows them declaring themselves lovers as they look bemused by their newly acquired taste for the toast topper.</p>
      <p>Former hater Eiran Khangura, 28 from Shadwell said “it tastes really nice”, whilst Helen Giles, 22 from London added “I feel like you’ve cured me!”.</p>
      <p>Whilst two of the participants remain firm haters, in an unusual twist, Edd, who didn’t enjoy the Marmite-covered crumpet during the test, has since declared himself a Marmite lover.</p>

      <p>In a private follow up video, filmed at home, Edd said: “I watched the Marmite Mind Control video and it didn’t work – I still hated Marmite. Since then, I’ve started smelling Marmite quite vividly. Yesterday, I tried a bit of Marmite on my finger, and it’s actually not that bad at all.”</p>
      <p>Rory Z Fulcher, Hypnotist, said: “All of the people who took part in the experiment shared two key characteristics. Firstly, they all absolutely hated Marmite. Secondly, they were all willing to change.</p>

      <p>“Nearly everyone in the world can be hypnotised, however, around 30% of the population are responsive to hypnosis. The results of the experiment exceeded our expectations with the majority of participants proving to be very responsive to hypnotic suggestion.</p>
      <p>“In the case of Edd, he experienced a delayed reaction to the hypnosis recording, which is not unusual for those that feel particularly strong in their convictions – in this case, his hate for Marmite. Hypnosis is a self-generated state, which means participants have the power to accept the hypnotic suggestions at any point – even hours, days or weeks after the hypnosis takes place.</p>

      <p>“Now we know the Marmite Mind Control film works, it would be possible to convert thousands more Marmite haters into lovers. But only if they’re willing to change!”</p>
      <p>The video comes as part of Marmite’s bid to stop the nation from sleepwalking into the same breakfast choices. From sugary cereals to jam on toast, the brand is encouraging Britain to consider savoury breakfast options as part of their breakfast repertoire.</p>

      <p>Rachel Chambers, Marketing Manager at Marmite, said: “When we embarked on our mission to find Britain’s most fierce Marmite haters, the aim was to orchestrate a unique social experiment.”</p>
      <p>“The results have staggered us and exceeded all expectations. After dividing families for over 100 years, we’re so pleased to have converted 80% of the participants to Marmite lovers. Here’s hoping they spread the love to their family and friends for years to come!”</p>
