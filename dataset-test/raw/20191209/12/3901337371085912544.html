      <p>Kaizer Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic is one of the most in-form players in the PSL currently, with his recent hat-trick testimony to that. Off the field, the Serbian is shining as well, and we took a peek at some of his best looks. Check it out!</p>
      <p>In what was some spectacle, Kaizer Chiefs and Bloemfontein Celtic played out to an eight-goal thriller this past weekend, as the Soweto giants romped to a 5-3 victory over Siwelele.</p>
      <p>The game also saw Nurkovic net an inspired hat-trick as he took his tally to nine goals in all competitions this season.</p>
