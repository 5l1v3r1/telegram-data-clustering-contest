      <p>Not wanting to disappoint the American pop star, these celebrities put on their best of clothes and trooped in to her hotel to meet with her. Unfortunately for them, they had to wait for close to 6 hours only to be told Cardi was not coming out anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale’s tight buddy who was displeased with how things turned out lamented saying;</p>
      <p>“I am really hurt. I am so so disappointed,” she said. “You know I was officially invited alongside with other celebrities to come and have a meet and greet with Cardi B but guess what? The organizers didn’t even let her show up, I came to the pool side and where she was chewing khebab. Yeah, it’s so embarrassing, like I’m sorry, all the celebrities that came out, sorry to you guys, sorry to me. We deserve better like this is really really sad. You know, I am a fan that is why I agreed to be here but I was treated anyhow.”</p>
      <p>Reacting to this,  Shatta Wale in a video clip said: “Ghana artistes, stop dey do that thing. You like dey do ahushieshe too much. What’s up? Don’t go day there, you people dress go sit there like you dey go church. Cardi B be stripper, she be street girl, she understands street.”</p>
      <p>He also took to his Twitter page to post that when he says Ghana is a village, people will lambast him.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale in order words was calling the celebrities “villagers” for wearing “church” clothes to meet a stripper.</p>
