      <h1>Garth Crooks lauds Tottenham star Son Heung-min after ‘extraordinary’ moment</h1>
      <h2>The 27-year-old netted a tremendous individual effort in a resounding win over Burnley on Saturday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:15:48+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/leeclarke/" target="_blank">Lee Clarke</a></address>

        <b><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50706000">BBC Sport pundit</a> Garth Crooks has compared the goal scored by Son Heung-min on Saturday to George Weah’s famous solo effort back in 1996.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The South Korean star ran virtually the length of the pitch to score for Tottenham at the weekend as they dispatched Burnley 5-0.</p>
      <p>Son netted the third goal during the demolition and handed Jose Mourinho his first clean sheet since taking the job last month.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is in great form this season. He has netted 10 goals and registered nine assists in all competitions.</p>

      <p>Former Liberian legend George Weah famously scored a superb solo effort whilst playing for AC Milan in 1996.</p>
      <p>Crooks believes Son’s moment of magic was similar.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50706000">He told BBC Sport:</a> “The last time I saw a goal scored of this quality it was by His Excellency the President of Liberia. He was then of course just George Weah playing for AC Milan.</p>
      <p>To run practically the entire length of the pitch, outrun a posse of defenders prior to putting the ball into the back of the net is quite extraordinary.</p>
      <p>“Son scored an early candidate for goal of the season and it’s quite an achievement to have something in common with the President of Liberia.”</p>
      <p>With Harry Kane typically smashing a glut of goals every season, Son often slips under the radar.</p>
      <p>The man with 89 caps for his country is arguably one of the most underrated players in the Premier League and his importance to Tottenham sometimes goes unnoticed.</p>
      <h3>Integral</h3>
      <p>Mourinho will clearly realise his importance, particularly after Saturday. He has started him in every game he has overseen and clearly rates him as a player.</p>

      <p>Tottenham are seventh in the league, six points behind Chelsea in fourth.</p>
      <p>Qualifying for the Champions League again will surely be Mourinho’s aim for the remainder of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Spurs face Bayern Munich on Wednesday in a dead rubber. Both clubs have qualified for the knockout stages and Tottenham cannot top the group.</p>
      <p>Pride is at stake though and the Londoners will hope to avenge an embarrassing 7-2 loss to Bayern earlier in the season.</p>
