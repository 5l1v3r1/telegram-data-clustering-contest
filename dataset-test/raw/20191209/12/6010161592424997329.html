      <h1>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne’s Safi’jiva Siege brings transforming armor and Awakened weapons to the game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:52:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>The Safi’Jiva Siege will kick off next week in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.</p>
      <p>Alongside the new Siege comes new armor for <b>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</b> players as well as three new weapons.</p>
      <p>Right now a recon quest related to  Safi’jiva (the adult form of  Xeno’jiiva) <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/12/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-update-new-weapon-trees-armor-skills-stygian-zinogre/">is live in-game</a>, which will familiarize you with what to expect once the siege goes live<b> December 13</b> and through <b>January 5</b>.</p>
      <p>The armour set you will earn from taking the monster out sounds rather cool. Once you have the entire set bonus active, the gear will change form. As far as the weapons are concerned, once you defeat the monster <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX1fPsCgK-g&amp;feature=emb_logo">you will receive Awakened versions</a>.</p>
      <p>Once you have the weapons appraised, you can choose three to keep. At least one of the weapons will match the type you currently have equipped. Each of the weapons will start with the same base stats but feature different elements and statuses.</p>
      <p>After slaying the Safi’jiva, you’ll be able to get the new material, <b>Rigid Dracolite</b>. You can then choose the weapons you want, each can be upgraded using the <b>Rigid Dracolite</b>. Upgrading adds<b> Awakened</b> abilities and these abilities, which are rolled, can increase affinity, sharpness, or even an armor kill bonus to the weapon.</p>
      <p>If you hit up Arekkz’s video below, he explains the new system and RNG elements in detail.</p>

      <p>You can now earn the <b>Defender Armor</b> and weapons in-game, which will give your stats a much-needed boost if you’re new to Monster Hunter World or haven’t played in a while and need to catch up a few levels. There’s a story mode you can complete that will net you these items and it’s pretty straightforward Monster Hunting.</p>
      <p>The Defender Armor will give you the following skills:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Recovery Up, Level 3:</b> Restores health by 30%. A Potion now heals 45 health and Mega Potion heals 91 health.</li>
        <li><b>Marathon Runner, Level 3:</b> Slows down your stamina depletion by 50%.</li>
        <li><b>Health Boost, Level 3:</b> Increases maximum health by 50.</li>
        <li><b>Divine Blessing, Level 3:</b> Damage taken is reduced by 50%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also simply buy the armour for 300 Zenny per item, which is a bargain.</p>
      <p>Also coming next week is the second part of the Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds collaboration for PS4 users.</p>
      <p>The event goes live on December 12. Here you will have the chance to craft all-new themed equipment fashioned after the Shield-Weaver armor and upgrade the Stormslinger weapon from the previous November quest.</p>
      <p>The opportunity to upgrade <b>Aloy’s Bow</b> and craft a new <b>Felyne Watcher</b> equipment will also be available and Palico companions can get special gear designed after Frostclaws, the bear-like machines from the game.</p>
      <p>And a third round of exclusive collaboration quests for PS4 players will be available on December 26. This event will let you create the Banuk α+ armor set which was originally available in  Monster Hunter World<i> </i>with Master Rank level stats.</p>
