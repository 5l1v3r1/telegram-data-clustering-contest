      <p>A Twitter campaign seeking to revive the dormant <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/stargate/"><i>Stargate </i></a>franchise has won support from series veterans Jewel Staite and Michael Shanks. Joseph Mallozzi -- a former showrunner of all three <i>Stargate </i>TV series, <a href="https://screenrant.com/stargate-sg-1-storylines-never-resolved/"><i>Stargate: SG-1</i></a>, <i>Stargate: Atlantis</i>, and <i>Stargate Universe --</i> fired off the campaign with the hashtag #WeWantStargate.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WeWantStargate&amp;src=trend_click&amp;pt=1203175654084136960%2C1203172049738330112">Mallozzi</a>, who was also the co-creator of Syfy's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dark-matters-marc-bendavid-talks-memory-loss-mystery-and-fight-scenes/"><i>Dark Matter</i></a> and is currently the showrunner of the upcoming <i>Utopia Falls</i>, is working to organize a fan campaign called <i>Stargate</i> Superdrive to grab the attention of the IP's current owner, MGM, and convince it to greenlight a new series.</p>

      <p>The last <i>Stargate </i>TV series, <i>Stargate Universe</i>, aired on Syfy from 2009-2011, but was <a href="https://www.cbr.com/syfy-executive-defends-decision-to-cancel-stargate-universe/">canceled</a> before a proper conclusion of the show's storylines could make it to the screen. Reports of a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/sorry-that-stargate-remake-isnt-happening-anytime-soon/">new film trilogy</a> then began circulating as late as 2015, but those plans were ultimately shelved. So, apart from a 2018 prequel web series <a href="https://www.cbr.com/stargate-origins-reboot-announced-sdcc/"><i>Stargate Origins</i></a>, several video games and graphic novels published by American Mythology Productions, the <i>Stargate </i>universe has remained in stasis for eight years.</p>
      <p>On <i>Stargate: Atlantis</i>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JewelStaite">Staite</a> played a member of the villainous alien species the Wraiths, and later, the protagonist Dr. Jennifer Keller. <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelShanks">Shanks</a> portrayed Dr. Daniel Jackson in both <i>Stargate: SG-1 </i>and <i>Stargate Universe, </i>a protagonist who originated in the 1994 film that kicked off the entire franchise and was initially played by James Spader.</p>
      <p>#WeWantStargate became a top trending hashtag. It remains to be seen if it will provoke a response from MGM.</p>
