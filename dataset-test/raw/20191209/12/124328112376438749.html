      <p>The centre back was snapped up by Spurs in 2017 and was a record signing at the time.</p>
      <p>He is paid £65,000 a week, which works out just over £3million a year.</p>
      <p>Sanchez Mina was landed in hot water earlier this year when he kicked out at <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><b>Arsenal defender </b></a>Laurent Koscielny during a north London derby.</p>
      <p>But he did not face retrospective punishment from the Football Association for his actions in the March game.</p>
