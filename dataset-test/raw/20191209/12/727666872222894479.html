      <p>Sorry, Beyhive. Your queen won't be performing a series of concerts in Sin City.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Beyoncé Knowles-Carter is not headed to the Vegas Strip for a 2020 residency. Speculation that Queen Bey was setting up shop in Nevada next year made headlines over the weekend.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/beyonce-las-vegas-residency-rumors-false-1203428422/">Variety</a></i>, a representative for Beyoncé said the Las Vegas residency rumors were “absolutely not true." Many of Bey's fans believed the reports because it was recently the ten-year anniversary of her 2009 live album<i> I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas.</i></p>
      <p>2019 was a big year for Beyoncé. She released her <i>HΘMΣCΘMING</i> concert film and live album. The 38-year-old singer/actress also starred in <i>The Lion King</i> animated film and curated <i>The Lion King: The Gift</i> compilation LP.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Recording Academy nominated Beyoncé for four awards at the 62nd Annual Grammys. The Parkwood Entertainment founder is up for Best Pop Solo Performance ("Spirit"), Best Song Written for Visual Media ("Spirit"), Best Pop Vocal Album (<i>The Lion King: The Gift</i>), and Best Music Film (<i>HΘMΣCΘMING</i>).</p>
