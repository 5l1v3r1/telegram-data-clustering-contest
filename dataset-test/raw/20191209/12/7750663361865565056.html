      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed the punishment in Lausanne after considering recommendations from its independent compliance review committee (CRC).</p>
      <p>The judgement means Russia will be banned from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar.</p>

      <p>Individual Russian athletes untainted by the scandal will able to compete independently under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>WADA said the decision was unanimous, but Russia's Anti Doping Agency (RUSADA) has 21 days to appeal against the ban.</p>
      <p>If it does so, the appeal will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p>
      <p>However, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 next summer, which it has qualified for and is a tournament host with games due to be played at St Petersburg.</p>
      <p>European football's governing body does not fall under the definition of a Major Events Organisation under the international compliance code.</p>
      <p>The CRC made its recommendations based on evidence presented to it by WADA's intelligence and investigations (I&amp;I) team.</p>

      <p>The I&amp;I team found there were inconsistencies in data handed over to WADA in January 2019 by Russia under the terms of its reinstatement to compliance in September 2018.</p>
      <p>The data provided was inconsistent with a copy of the database supplied to WADA by a whistleblower in 2017, in that positive findings present in 2017 were missing from the 2019 data.</p>
      <p>The I&amp;I team found that some of the manipulation and deletion had occurred as recently as December 2018 and January 2019 â€“ after reinstatement.</p>
      <p>Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015 when it was first declared non-compliant.</p>
