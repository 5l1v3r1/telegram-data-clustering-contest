Mujhe tumse bohat, bohat pyaar ho gaya hai. Actually, you are the reason why I wanted to become an actor when I was 10. So, tonight, I would like to share this award with you as well. And I hope I can meet you one day," Muhammad Khan exclaimed in his speech.</p>
      <p>Before walking down the stage, Muhammad sang SRK's 1998 hit song Mere Mehboob Mere Sanam from his film Duplicate as the audience clapped and cheered for him.</p>
