      <p>Going to their last match of the year against Black Leopards next Saturday, Pirates currently have three players on three yellow cards each, this after Paseka Mako joined the list with his caution in the 2-2 draw against Baroka FC at the weekend. </p>

      <p>Bucs will get their 2020 league campaign underway with a match against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium on January 04.       </p>
