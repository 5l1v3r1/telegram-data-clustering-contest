      <p>A TV reporter said she was left “violated” and “embarrassed” after being smacked on the bottom during a live broadcast.</p>
      <p>Alex Bozarjian, of WSAV News, was reporting roadside from a 10km race in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/savannah">Savannah</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/georgia">Georgia</a>, when a male participant ran up behind and struck her.</p>
      <p>Ms Bozarjian appeared visibly shocked in footage of the incident as streams of runners continued to pass her on Savannah Bridge.</p>
      <p>She later condemned the runner, saying: “To the man who smacked my butt on live TV this morning: you violated, objectified, and embarrassed me.</p>
      <p>“No woman should EVER have to put up with this at work or anywhere! Do better.”</p>
      <p>Fellow reporters showed their support for Ms Bozarjian’s statement on Twitter, while criticising the man responsible.</p>
      <p>“I’m so heated for you,” Emily Bloch of the <i>Florida Times-Union</i> said. “This is disgusting. Sending strength and solidarity your way. Now, let’s get this grimy dude and warn the women in his life.”</p>
      <p>ABC News 13’s Caitlyn Penter wrote: “DO NOT TOUCH REPORTERS. Period.”</p>
      <p>Ms Bozarjian was covering the annual Savannah Bridge Run on Saturday when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>Robert Wells, director of the Savannah sports council, promised to find the runner and take action.</p>
      <p>“Alex, what happened today is 100 per cent unacceptable,” Mr Wells said. “You have my assurance we will identify him.</p>
      <p>“This will not be tolerated at our events. Glad we have race bibs and photos for easy identification.”</p>
