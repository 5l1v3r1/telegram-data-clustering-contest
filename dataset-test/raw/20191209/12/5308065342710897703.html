      <p>For some time now, some Ministers in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad have spoken publicly on the existence of a ‘deep state’.</p>
      <p>They argued it was a powerful entity that is sabotaging the works of the Pakatan Harapan government, including blocking attempts at reform within the civil service.<br/>Yesterday in Langkawi, Dr Mahathir said he will seek information over allegations of the existence of the “deep state”.</p>
      <p>He told reporters the ‘parallel’ entity is allegedly trying to sabotage the administration of the Pakatan Harapan government and it is a movement that is active among civil servants.</p>
      <p>He also said he will seek information on the existence and activities of the group.</p>

      <p>In April, Foreign Affairs Minister Saifuddin Abdullah alluded to the deep state in Malaysia saying it is out to undermine the Pakatan Harapan government.</p>
      <p>According to him, the deep state wanted to remove the new government through undemocratic means.</p>
      <p>He referred to them as a “state within a state” pursuing its agenda outside the national political leadership.</p>
      <p>But Dr Mahathir said the Pakatan government was capable of handling it if it was indeed taking place.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if it is taking place but if a hidden state exists, I think we can contain it. Prior to this, there were a lot of problems when I was prime minister, but we could continue to administer…I will deal with it, I will view and study the matter first,” he said.</p>
      <p>Recently, the Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry Ministry secretary-general Mohd Sallehhuddin Hassan got transferred from the Agriculture and Agro-Based ministry.<br/>The media wanted to know if that happened because of the hidden hands of the deep state.</p>
      <p>The PM says he was not sure and would seek information on the matter.</p>
      <p>When the Pakatan Harapan was in the opposition, it campaigned against what it calls a ‘bloated’ civil service.</p>
      <p>After 61 years in power, it is not surprising that the civil service is filled with pro-Barisan Nasional elements, said an observer. -/TISG</p>
