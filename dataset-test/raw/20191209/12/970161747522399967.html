      <h1>White Island survivors describe carnage after New Zealand volcano erupts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:43:57+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Harrison Jones</a></address>
      <p>Survivors from the volcanic eruption in New Zealand have described their terrifying ordeal.</p>
      <p>Up to 30 people are feared dead after<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/new-zealand-volcano-erupts-white-island-people-injured-missing-11413508/"> ‘White Island’ blew up at around 2.10pm, while tourists were visiting the site</a>.</p>
      <p>Horrifying footage shows the aftermath of the eruption from on board a boat, in which survivors are urged to get inside as a giant ash cloud races across the island, also known as Whakaari.</p>
      <p>50 people were on the island at the time of the incident, police said. They added that 23 had escaped, including 5 dead, but said that there was no further ‘sign of life’.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Michael Schade wrote: ‘My god, White Island volcano in New Zealand erupted today for first time since 2001.</p>

      <p>‘My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it. Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable.’</p>
      <p>Sharing footage of the incident as a boat raced away from the site, he continued: ‘This is so hard to believe. Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not 30 minutes before.</p>
      <p>‘My thoughts with the families of those currently unaccounted for, the people recovering now, and especially the rescue workers.’</p>
      <p>People on board a boat are heard shouting ‘oh my god, go, go, go, go, we’ve got to get out of here’ as the ash cloud approaches.</p>
      <p>Sharing footage on Twitter, ‘Dina’, wrote: ‘This is video we were taking as our boat tried to get us a safe distance before going back for survivors.</p>
      <p>‘It didn’t dawn on us right away what had just happened or that there were still people were still on the island.’</p>

      <p>Another tourist, Aline Moura, shared a number of videos on Instagram and explained: ‘This was the end of today’s trip that I had. The beginning was excellent, lots of cool pictures, amazing experience…</p>
      <p>‘But nature is autonomous and man has no control over his will.</p>
      <p>‘Surely we never forget that day. Let us pray that everyone will be fine.’</p>
      <p>Her partner, Brazilian Allessandro Kauffmann, also shared a series of Instagram stories and added: ‘Some people have extensive burns on their bodies. Two tours on the volcano. Ours was the first. The other one right after…</p>
      <p>‘We left the island and wasn’t even five minutes before it erupted. This other tour that arrived after couldn’t leave in time.’</p>
      <p>Royal Caribbean International have confirmed that passengers from its ship Ovation of the Seas passengers were visiting the island.</p>
