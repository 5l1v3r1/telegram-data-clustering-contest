      <h1>'Brahmastra': Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Amitabh Bachchan starrer gets postponed yet again; here's the new rumoured release date</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:07:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Filmmaker <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayan-Mukerji">Ayan Mukerji</a> is all set to treat the audiences to a fantasy-action drama '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brahmastra">Brahmastra</a>', starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranbir-Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alia-Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Amitabh-Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> in the lead. However, according to the latest reports, there has been a slight delay.</p>
      <p>If reports are to be believed, then Ranbir and Alia will not be able to keep their date with the audience in the Summer of 2020. It is being said that the reason behind this delay is that a major chunk of VFX work is left to be completed, which includes scenes with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the film was slated to hit theatres on Christmas 2019, but they chose to delay the project in order to pay attention to the VFX work and match international standards.</p>
      <p>Reports also suggest that the company which is working on the visual effects has informed the makers that they will not be able to complete the work by summer 2020 due to the complexities in the visuals. Although "shocked" and unhappy by the same, it is being said that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karan-Johar">Karan Johar</a> and Ayan are now looking for a release in the last quarter of 2020 as they don't want to present a "half baked" film to the audiences.</p>
      <p>The official announcement of the new release date is expected to be made with the release of a new poster or teaser.</p>
      <p>Though the fans will have to wait a tad longer, KJo will reportedly make sure that the team delivers a blockbuster visual spectacle.</p>
      <p>The film that also stars Nagarjuna and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mouni-Roy">Mouni Roy</a> in the pivotal roles is currently in its final leg that is being shot in Manali.</p>
