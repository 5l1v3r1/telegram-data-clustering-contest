      <p>Gino D’Acampo seriously struggled with his pronunciation on today’s episode of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> and accidentally dropped a dirty expletive live on air.</p>
      <p>The celebrity chef, who hails from Italy, made the blunder in conversation with presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield over the scent of truffles.</p>
      <p>‘Not many people like truffle because of the smell,’ Gino began, before going onto explain that if you give the fungus a good old sniff you can get over any distaste for its aroma.</p>
      <p>‘For people at home and you don’t like it, do this experiment,’ he continued as he instructed Holly to close her eyes as he tried it out on her. ‘I’m going to open and what I want you to do is to just analate it. Analate it as much as you can.</p>
      <p>‘The more you do that, analate…’</p>
      <p>But before Gino could continue, Holly and Phil stopped him in his tracks and corrected him.</p>

      <p>Gino then attempted to say ‘inhale it’ correctly but stumbled over his pronunciation, causing Phil to urge him to ‘stop’ trying.</p>
      <p>Naturally, audiences were in stitches over Gino’s mistake and shared their thoughts on Twitter through tears of laughter.</p>
      <p>‘Gino Anal’ing truffle on This Morning is the highlight of my morning,’ wrote one.</p>
      <p>Echoing a similar sentiment, another added: ‘Gino D’campo strikes again.’</p>

      <p>Elsewhere on today’s show, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/phillip-schofield-ignores-complaint-allegations-continues-presenting-morning-holly-willoughby-normal-11440298/">Holly and Phil continued presenting as normal</a> despite reports that some presenters have ‘complained about Phil’s behaviour’.</p>
      <p>The hosts returned to front the show and didn’t mention allegations that their partnership is strained, with the episode kicking off with them both sat on a Ferris wheel outside the London studios.</p>
      <p>Holly and Phil were joined by the likes of Aled Jones, Russell Watson and Martin Lewis over the course of the shows two hours.</p>
