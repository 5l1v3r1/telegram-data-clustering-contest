      <h1>Five dead, many injured after New Zealand volcano eruption</h1>

      <p>Five people were killed, 18 were injured and several more were left stranded after an island volcano popular with tourists erupted unexpectedly in New Zealand on Monday.</p>
      <p>Police said some 50 people were visiting White Island when it exploded suddenly in the early afternoon — hurling ash and rock high into the air.</p>
      <p>Two dozen people made it off the island, five of whom have since died. The rest are being treated for injuries, including severe burns.</p>
      <p>Nothing is yet known about a group — now estimated to number in the double digits — who are still trapped on the island.</p>
      <p>“We’re unsure of the exact numbers on there and we’re unsure of their wellbeing,” said deputy commissioner John Tims.</p>
      <p>As night fell, he said volcanic activity made a rescue attempt too dangerous.</p>
      <p>“The island is unstable, there’s a danger of further eruptions, it is physically unsafe for us to return to the island”</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to consider the safety of our people and emergency services staff.”</p>
      <p>The eruption occurred at 2:11 pm (0111 GMT), thrusting a thick plume of white ash 3.6 kilometres (12,000 feet) into the sky.</p>
      <p>Seconds before, live camera feeds showed a group of more than a half dozen people walking on the crater floor. Then the images went black.</p>
      <p>A “considerable number” of those caught up in the disaster are believed to be Australian, according to officials in Canberra.</p>
      <p>As many as 30 people are also believed to be cruise passengers on a day trip from the vessel Ovation of the Seas, Kevin O’Sullivan, chief executive officer of industry body the New Zealand Cruise Association told AFP.</p>
      <p>The ship’s operator Royal Caribbean — who had billed the trip to White Island as “an unforgettable guided tour of New Zealand’s most active volcano” — said “a number of our guests were touring the island” but did not confirm that number.</p>
      <p>The ship has a capacity of around 4,000 people and set sail from Sydney last week on a 12-day voyage.</p>
      <p>– Scene of terror –<br/>Tourist Michael Schade made it off the island just in time and was able to capture footage of the devastation.</p>
      <p>His videos showed groups of startled tourists clustered by the shoreline, waiting to be evacuated as the ground around them smouldered, the sky filled with white debris. An ash-caked helicopter lies damaged nearby.</p>
      <p>As his ship hurtled away, the caldera became virtually invisible, shrouded by a thick bank of ash.</p>
      <p>Volcanic Air said they had landed a helicopter on the island shortly before the eruption carrying four visitors and one pilot. All were now accounted for.</p>
      <p>“It had landed on the island. What happened after that we don’t know, but we know that all five made it back to Whakatane on one of the tourist boats,” a company spokesman told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>Guillaume Calmelet, the co-director of Skydive Tauranga, saw the eruption from above as he took a customer on a tandem skydive from a plane 12,000 feet above the Bay of Plenty.</p>
      <p>“As soon as the parachute opened there was this huge cloud that was really different to whatever we’ve seen before,” he told<i> AFP</i>. “I could see it coming out in freefall, so probably about 30 seconds for the whole cloud to form, if that. It was pretty quick.”</p>
      <p>The country’s National Emergency Management Agency described the eruption as “moderate”, although the plume of ash was clearly visible from the mainland and from satellites flying overhead.</p>
      <p>“We have seen a steady decline in activity since the eruption. There remains significant uncertainty as to future changes but currently, there are no signs of escalation.”</p>
      <p>White Island — – also known as Whakaari — is about 50 kilometres (30 miles) offshore in the picturesque Bay of Plenty and is popular with adventurous tourists willing to don hard hats and gas masks.</p>
      <p>It is New Zealand’s most active volcano cone and about 70 per cent of it is underwater, according to government-backed agency GeoNet.</p>
      <p>Around 10,000 people visit the volcano every year. It has erupted frequently over the last half-century, most recently in 2016.</p>
      <p>In August of that year, the New Zealand Defence Force airlifted a 2.4-tonne shipping container onto the island to serve as an emergency shelter in case of an eruption.</p>
      <p>“Sudden, unheralded eruptions from volcanoes such as White Island can be expected at any time,” said University of Auckland volcanologist Shane Cronin.</p>
      <p>“The hazards expected from such events are the violent ejection of hot blocks and ash, and formation of ‘hurricane-like’ currents of wet ash and coarse particles that radiate from the explosion vent.”</p>
      <p>“These can be deadly in terms of causing impact trauma, burns and respiratory problems. The eruptions are short-lived, but once one occurs, there are high chances for further, generally smaller ones as the system re-equilibrates.” hg</p>
