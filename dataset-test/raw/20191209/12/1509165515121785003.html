      <h1>Eagles’ Miles Sanders rapidly approaching these notable franchise rookie records</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:04:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Kaye, nj.com</a></address>
      <p>PHILADELPHIA -- <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/10/week-8-studs-and-duds-from-eagles-win-over-bills-miles-sanders-jordan-howard-eat-up-yards-ronald-darby-bounces-back-after-injury-hiatus.html">Miles Sanders</a>’ first season with the <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/">Eagles</a> could set a new bar for all future rookie playmakers who arrive in Philadelphia after him.</p>
      <p>Sanders is rapidly approaching a pair of notable franchise rookie milestones.</p>
      <p>While he <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/09/heres-why-eagles-miles-sanders-wont-be-buried-on-the-bench-mike-groh-weighs-in-on-rookies-fumbling-woes.html">struggled during the first half of the season</a>, the second-round pick is only 117 rushing yards away from tying former All-Pro running back <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/08/nfl-rumors-bills-to-release-former-eagles-rb-lesean-mccoy-is-it-time-for-a-reunion.html">LeSean McCoy</a>’s franchise rookie rushing record (637), which was set in 2009.</p>
      <p>He is also just 129 total yards away from tying former Pro Bowl wide receiver <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/09/eagles-week-3-inactives-desean-jackson-alshon-jeffery-highlight-list-of-sidelined-players-vs-lions-will-dallas-goedert-play.html">DeSean Jackson</a>’s franchise rookie record for scrimmage yards (1,008), set in 2008.</p>
      <p>While Sanders has <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/10/duce-staley-explained-jordan-howard-miles-sanders-rb-rotation-so-far-and-how-it-might-look-going-forward-does-it-make-sense.html">received most of his praise for his ability to catch out of the backfield</a>, the rookie has produced 184 rushing yards over the past three games with veteran running back <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/11/eagles-week-11-inactives-will-jordan-howard-play-vs-patriots-the-latest-on-sidney-joness-status.html">Jordan Howard</a> sidelined with a shoulder injury. He collected a career-high 83 rushing yards during the Eagles’ <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/12/nfl-playoff-picture-eagles-lose-to-dolphins-on-the-road-heres-what-win-means-for-nfc-east-division-race.html">Week 13 loss to the Miami Dolphins</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think [Sanders] continues to improve every week,” offensive coordinator Mike Groh said during his Wednesday press conference. "I think you can really see a lot of that growth in the run game.”</p>
      <p>Even if Howard were to return to the lineup at some point during the home stretch of the season, Sanders would only need to average 29.5 rushing yards over the next four games to break McCoy’s 2009 franchise rookie rushing record.</p>
      <p>“I think you’re seeing the patience in the running game,” Eagles coach Doug Pederson said Saturday, regarding Sanders. “His vision is better, it’s improved from Week 1 to Week 13."</p>
      <p>McCoy had 945 scrimmage yards (637 rushing, 308 receiving) and four touchdowns as a rookie. Sanders already has 879 scrimmage yards and three touchdowns. Those numbers include 359 receiving yards and two receiving scores. Sanders could surpass McCoy’s rookie production on <a href="https://www.nj.com/giants/2019/12/giants-vs-eagles-forecast-heres-how-rain-will-impact-monday-night-football-matchup-in-week-14.html">Monday</a> against the <a href="https://www.nj.com/giants/">Giants</a> by producing 66 total yards, a mark the Penn State alum has hit or exceeded in seven of his 12 career games.</p>
      <p>Jackson’s rookie scrimmage yards mark is also well within Sanders’ reach over the next four games. Sanders needs to average just 32.3 total yards per game to surpass Jackson and set a new franchise rookie scrimmage yards record.</p>
      <p>Jackson and McCoy both built on their impressive rookie campaigns by becoming household names as Pro Bowl playmakers for the Eagles.</p>
      <p>McCoy eventually set the Eagles’ franchise records for season and career rushing yards. Jackson, who returned to the Eagles in March, is fourth on the team’s all-time receiving yards list and seventh on the franchise’s all-time receptions board.</p>
      <p>With Sanders off to an equally impressive start, the Eagles should feel very good about their rookie running back.</p>
      <p>Sanders can further the confidence of the Eagles’ coaching staff and front office by finishing his rookie season with a breakout performance during the final month of the campaign.</p>
      <p>With the Eagles <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/12/nfl-playoff-picture-cowboys-lose-to-bears-heres-what-week-14-results-mean-for-eagles-in-nfc-east-division-race.html">still in the NFC East division race</a> and <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/12/eagles-injury-update-the-latest-on-jordan-howard-has-he-been-cleared-for-contact.html">Howard still reeling from his shoulder injury</a>, Sanders could be one of the biggest factors in Philadelphia’s push toward a third consecutive <a href="https://www.nj.com/sports/2019/12/updated-afc-nfc-standings-seeds-projected-postseason-matchups-through-week-14-ravens-49ers-headed-for-home-field-advantage-patriots-slipping.html">postseason</a> berth.</p>
      <p>“The more he gets time, the more he gets snaps,” Pederson said, “the better he’ll get.”</p>
