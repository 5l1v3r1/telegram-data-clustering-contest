      <p>Diana Prince reunites with Steve Trevor in the first trailer for <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/patty-jenkins-will-direct-wonder-woman-sequel-delighted-253619"><i>Wonder Woman 1984</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The brand new trailer sees the superhero, played by Gal Gadot, embracing Chris Pine's pilot as he tells her "the world needs you".</p>

      <p>In a voiceover, Gadot can be heard saying: "My life hasn't been what you probably think it has, we all have our struggles."</p>
      <p>It offers a first look at Kristen Wiig as Barbara Minerva, who asks her if she has ever been in love to which Diana replies: "A long, long time ago."</p>
      <p>While Wonder Woman was set in the 1940s, the sequel sees the action move to the 1980s, with Gadot sporting big hair.</p>

      <p>There are also shots of people performing aerobics in leotards, while Pedro Pascal's Max Lord wears classic 1980s power suits and Trevor wears a shellsuit with a fanny pack.</p>
      <p>Wonder Woman can be heard saying: "Nothing good is born from lies and greatness is not what you think."</p>
      <p>The trailer touts the new film, directed by Patty Jenkins, a "a new era of wonder".</p>
