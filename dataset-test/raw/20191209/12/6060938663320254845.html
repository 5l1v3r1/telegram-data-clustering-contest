      <p>HYDERABAD: PV Sindhu toiled hard for the last two-and-half weeks and is confident of regaining top form when she competes at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/BWF-Tour-Finals">BWF Tour Finals</a>. After winning the world championship, Sindhu lost momentum and exited in the early rounds of the next six tournaments.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, who is drawn in Group 'A' along with Chen Yu Fei of China, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akane-Yamaguchi">Akane Yamaguchi</a> of Japan and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/He-Bingjiao">He Bingjiao</a> of China, said that six of the eight have equal chance of winning the title. Group 'B' comprises Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nozomi-Okuhara">Nozomi Okuhara</a> of Japan, Ratchanok Intanon and Busanan Ongamrungphan of Thailand.</p>
      <p>Sindhu worked with Korean coach Park Tae Sang to rectify her mistakes. They have watched all the matches from the last six tournaments and noticed some important points. "I am training with him for the last two-and-half weeks. He is helping me to rectify my mistakes. It's important to have good communication with the coach.</p>
      <p>We are watching all my matches and analysing where I had done wrong," Sindhu told TOI before leaving for the Tour Finals, which begins in Guangzhou on December 11.</p>
      <p>The world No.6 admitted that she was very disappointed with her poor show after winning the Worlds. "Obviously, I felt bad, then I didn't think that I am going down, then I worked out on my mistakes and improved. I don't feel that I am going down, definitely I lost in the tournaments but I worked and rectified my mistakes," she said.</p>
      <p>Sindhu said that there were some mistakes from her side as she conceded big leads. "I have made mistakes from my side. Many a time I conceded big leads and it was difficult to cover that gap. I think I was not lucky enough as I lost some close matches. I thought I could have been more patient," said Sindhu adding that she is working more on being consistent.</p>
      <p>"My preparation went on well. I got some valuable time and I worked hard in practice. I am working more on improving my consistency," she added</p>
      <p>Asked if she was under pressure to perform after winning the world title, Sindhu said, "No, there is no pressure. It's indeed different after becoming world champion, responsibilities are there. But it is mostly like, every match is a new match. For every tournament the players are changing their strategy. So, you can't expect the same kind of matches every time. Definitely, it is going to be very much different. You can never take it easy at this stage".</p>
