      <hr/>
      <p>Montreal producer, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kaytranada/profile">Kaytranada</a>, has one of the most distinct sounds in music: rubber-thick basslines, sun-soaked synths and perfectly-placed percussion. The attempts of countless people to mimic his blueprint sent him down paths of reinvention, proving he could switch it up if he pleases. However, today, he returned with a song that bursts with that classic Kaytra bounce.</p>
      <p>"10%" features Kali Uchis, who has previously collaborated with the producer on her 2015 song "Rush". The song serves as the first single off <i>BUBBA</i>, Kaytra's sophomore project that was surprise-announced today and will arrive this Friday (Dec. 13). Like his critically-acclaimed debut, <i>99.9%</i>, his new album boasts a wonderful selection of guests. <i>BUBBA</i> will feature <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/goldlink/profile">GoldLink</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tinashe/profile">Tinashe</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/MickJenkins/profile">Mick Jenkins</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Pharrell/profile">Pharrell</a> Williams, Teedra Moses and many more. Peep the tracklist below and go dance to "10%".</p>
