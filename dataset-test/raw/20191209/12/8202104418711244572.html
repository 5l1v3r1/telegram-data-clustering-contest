      <p>By Micah C.</p>
      <p>Do you ever go out in public wearing a disguise, so no one knows who you really are and you can choose who you want to be? Don’t answer too quickly, because most of us do this all the time.</p>
      <p>An internet persona is a social identity online. Some consider it a presentation of yourself. Everyone sees what you present online. You put the best attributes out there and no one sees your worst.</p>
      <p>How do you think other people see you when you put out an image of yourself that isn’t entirely accurate? This is a dangerous road to go down, and I found that out the hard way.</p>
      <p>I’ve always heard grown-ups talk about other people being the problem when you go online. When you can’t even hold a stable identity online, though, is it really the other people?</p>
      <p>If you go online, you might expect that everybody is acting like themselves, just online instead of in person, right? That’s what people thought of me, but was I really myself?</p>
      <p>The answer was no. I used to act in two different ways. In person I would be this good little boy, teacher’s pet, parent pleaser, anything along those lines. Online I would be a different person — I would be everything I thought I wanted to be at the time.</p>
      <p>I would be tougher in some ways — being a sensitive and introverted boy, I didn’t really have the confidence to expose that part of myself. It’s a standard idea that all guys are meant to be strong or manly.</p>
      <p>An example could be group chats, where people would say things I would never say. I went along with it, though. I kind of pushed out my morals and let it happen.</p>
      <p>I didn’t learn until much later that it’s okay to have feelings, and in the moment it felt good to be abrasive. I wasn’t doing it in a very smart or healthy way, though.</p>
      <p>It was unhealthy because most of the people I was talking with were complete strangers. They weren’t necessarily all my friends from my school. They would’ve seen me as something nobody else really would.</p>
      <p>To most people in real life, I would be that sweet little kid they always knew, but to others online, I would be the opposite. I could even consider myself to be a little insensitive and rude at some points, but those people really liked me for it.</p>
      <p>They thought I was funny and interesting, things I never considered myself to be. But think about what it would be like once they met me in person. I was a really quiet and shy person, honestly speaking. I still am — that’s just part of me, and that’s okay.</p>
      <p>I remember being someone completely different when I was younger. I feel like parts that I used to just simply act became actual parts of me. I didn’t even notice it happening.</p>
      <p>It attracted an audience of people I never wanted. I would meet people on social media as that person I didn’t really want to be. Then I would hang out with them and sometimes I would pretend to be that person; other times it was just awkward.</p>
      <p>It’s interesting to think about how many people like me could exist on your favourite social media platforms.</p>
      <p>I wish I would have just been myself. It isn’t worth it. It’s a short term feeling that has long term consequences.</p>
      <p>Always be yourself. Everyone deserves a chance to express themselves, online or in real life. They deserve respect. I didn’t have any for myself. No one ever really showed me I could be me until I learned it on my own.</p>
