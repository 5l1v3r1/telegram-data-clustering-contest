      <p>— Oxford police received a report Nov. 30 of toys valued at approximately $200 taken from the trunk of a car parked in a driveway on Kelly Drive.</p>
      <p>The report was made by a woman who had purchased the toys as Christmas presents for her daughter and had been left in the trunk of the vehicle for several days. The toys had been purchased at Target at Bridgewater Falls and still in their bags, although the toys were taken and the bags left behind.</p>
      <p>She told the officer one item was an “LOL Surprise! 2-in-1 Glamper Fashion Camper” valued at $100. The other toys were “LOL Surprise!” brand toys but smaller, miscellaneous items with an approximate value of another $100, although she could not recall what they were.</p>
      <p>The victim was not sure when she had last seen them but believes they had been left in the trunk for two or three days. She said the car did not seem to have been broken into and said she did not have a spare key to the car.</p>
      <p>She said she is usually good about locking her vehicle but said it is possible she hit the “Trunk” button on the key fob accidentally at some point, which would have opened the trunk. She said she believes using the key fob is the only way to open the trunk.</p>
