      <p>Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus says the environment on “Saturday Night Live” (SNL) was very sexist during her tenure.</p>
      <p>Although there were plenty of “incredibly funny” people on the show, the “Veep” star told Stephen Colbert that it was also a “very sexist” environment during her three-year tenure, reports ew.com.</p>

      <p>“I was unbelievably naive and I didn’t really understand how the dynamics of the place worked,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It was very sexist, very sexist. People were doing crazy drugs at the time. I was oblivious. I just thought, ‘Oh wow. He’s got a lot of energy’,” she added.</p>
      <p>The two comedians took part in a Q&amp;A session during the Montclair Film Festival held in Montclair in New Jersey, where they discussed Louis-Dreyfus’ career from “Saturday Night Live” to “Seinfeld” to her successful “Veep”.</p>
      <p>Despite “Saturday Night Live” not being the right fit for her, Louis-Dreyfus found a silver lining in working on the show.</p>
      <p>“It was a pretty brutal time, but it was a very informative time for me,” she said, as it taught her to value the “fun-meter” of her subsequent jobs.</p>
      <p>“I learned I wasn’t going to do any more of this show-business crap unless it was fun. I don’t have to walk and crawl through this kind of nasty glass if it’s not ultimately going to be fulfilling, and so that’s how I sort of moved forward from that moment. I sort of applied that ‘fun meter’ to every job I’ve had since and that has been very helpful,” she explained.</p>
