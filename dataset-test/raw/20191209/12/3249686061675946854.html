      <p>Fans are celebrating <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kang-daniel">Kang Daniel</a>'s 23rd birthday by making a big donation to terminally ill children.<br/><br/>According to one of idols' fan-made Daum cafes '<b>God Daniel</b>,' they donated 12,100,000 Korean won (roughly $10,000 USD) to the <b>Korea Association for Children with Terminal Diseases</b>, matching the donation money amount with his December 10 birthday.<i><br/><br/>"Please use [the donation money] for the treatment and well-being of children suffering from terminal diseases," </i>the members of the cafe told the organization in the letter shared with their donation. <i>"It is only a small amount of money, but we hope the children affected can be cured and will be able to run around dreaming of their future."</i></p>
      <p>A representative for the association thanked the fan cafe, adding that they will be using the money to treat the affected children with the goal of helping them make a full recovery so that they can have successful futures.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, for Kang Daniels' birthday last year, fans <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/12/fans-of-wanna-one-s-kang-daniel-celebrate-with-donation-relay-to-support-nation-s-youth">held a 'donation relay,'</a> raising money for Korea's <b>Social Welfare Society</b>, <b>UNICEF</b>, <b>Korean Children's Vaccination Foundation</b>,<b> </b>as well as the idol's former middle school <b>Shinsung Junior High School</b>.</p>
