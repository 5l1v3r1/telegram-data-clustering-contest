      <h1>NBA Power Rankings Week 8: Lakers have most wins, but Bucks' blowouts keep them No. 1</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:41:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN.com</a></address>
      <p>The first week of December is starting to establish an elite duo at the top of what is becoming a top-heavy league.</p>
      <p>The win streak of the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a> didn't come close to being snapped this week, and they retain the top spot ahead of the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>. But here come the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> surging right behind them to leap past the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a> to round out the top four.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Throughout the regular season, our panel (ESPN's Tim MacMahon, Andre' Snellings, Royce Young and Bobby Marks, and The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears) is ranking all 30 teams from top to bottom, taking stock of which teams are playing the best basketball now and which teams are looking most like title contenders.</i>

      <p>The Bucks aren't just sporting the longest winning streak in the NBA this season at 14 games and counting, but they are also lowering the boom on their opponents. They are fresh off a 28-point demolition of the Clippers that might not have even been that close, and their plus-13.6 scoring margin on the season is ahead of pace for the best such margin in NBA history of plus-12.3 from the 1971-72 Lakers. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

      <p>The Lakers have won 11 straight road games and ended Sunday with a league-best 11-1 road record. After beating the Timberwolves on Sunday, Los Angeles will go on the road to play Orlando, Miami, Atlanta and Indiana before a showdown in Milwaukee. The Lakers' only road loss was in the season opener against the Clippers on Oct. 22, and they have not lost a road game away from Staples Center. <i>-- Spears</i></p>

      <p>The wins over Miami and Denver last week further cemented the status of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6479/kemba-walker">Kemba Walker</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3917376/jaylen-brown">Jaylen Brown</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum">Jayson Tatum</a> as Boston's new Big Three, a trio that could also represent the Celtics in Chicago for the All-Star Game. The three players combined to average 72 points out of the team's 110 during those two games, and Brown had his breakout performance of the season, averaging 26 points (on 51.4% from the field and 50% from 3) and 5.5 rebounds and committing only two total turnovers. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>It's hard not to have some kind of a reaction to the Bucks' jarring 28-point win in what was supposed to be a marquee showdown. But it probably says more about the Bucks' general awesomeness than an issue with the Clippers. Doc Rivers said it best after the game: "It was <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo">Giannis</a>' birthday, and we searched all over the city to find a gift and we couldn't find one, so we gave him this one. That's all I can come up with because we were awful." That's it for regular-season games between the Bucks and Clippers, though. If they're going to meet again, it will have to be in June. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>The Heat's win in Toronto -- an intense overtime victory featuring a <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler">Jimmy Butler</a> takeover -- was the kind of statement they've been looking for since the opening week of the season. Which made it understandable that the Heat were run over by the Celtics 24 hours later in an unfortunate back-to-back. But they handled the Wizards and escaped the Bulls in overtime (with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395725/tyler-herro">Tyler Herro</a> hitting big shot after big shot after big shot ... after big shot), continuing their impressive trend of taking care of business against teams they're better than. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>The Raptors just completed a tough four-game stretch that saw them face the Jazz, Heat and Rockets at home before going on the road against the rival 76ers. They stumbled a bit during this stretch, especially defensively, but are still right in the mix with the five Eastern Conference teams vying for second behind the surging Bucks. The Raptors also got <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3012/kyle-lowry">Kyle Lowry</a> back, reintroducing another strong perimeter threat to a balanced unit that currently ranks 10th in offensive efficiency at 110.1 points per 100 possessions. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

      <p>It's the first real rough patch of the season for the Nuggets, who have lost four of five, with the lone win being a gimme against the Knicks. In litmus test games against the Lakers and Celtics, Denver looked a notch below and showed signs of tangible issues on offense. In these past five games, they are pretty much holding steady defensively. But offensively, they're scoring 104.8 points per 100 possessions, which for the season would rank just above the bottom five of the league. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>The sight of Cleveland on the schedule Saturday night was exactly what the 76ers needed. On the heels of a six-point loss to the Wizards on Thursday, the Sixers went on to beat the Cavaliers by 47 points, setting a franchise record with a 41-point halftime lead. In Thursday's loss, however, the 76ers turned the ball over 21 times -- <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid">Joel Embiid</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907387/ben-simmons">Ben Simmons</a> committed a combined 15 turnovers -- and that led to 30 Washington points.

      <p>The Grizzlies are the only team that the Jazz have beaten over the past seven games. Fortunately for Utah, Memphis was on the schedule twice in that span. The Jazz's 126-112 win over the Grizzlies on Saturday was the start of a soft stretch of schedule, featuring seven straight opponents who are .500 or worse. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>

      <p>If there was a silver lining to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a>'s injury, it was that it came at the right time in the schedule. In the absence of Irving, Brooklyn has gone 9-3, including a 7-0 record against teams under .500. Besides taking advantage of the schedule, Brooklyn has patched up two deficiencies that plagued it early in the season: rebounding and sharing the ball. In the two wins at Atlanta and Charlotte, the Nets averaged 51 rebounds, including 16.5 offensive boards and 30.5 assists with a season-high 35 at Charlotte. Before both games, the Nets averaged 10.5 offensive rebounds with only 23.8 assists. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>The Timberwolves have lost eight of their past 11 games, including four in a row, and now find themselves tied at 10-12 with Oklahoma City and Phoenix for seventh in the West. The Timberwolves lack a consistent team identity on either side of the ball, ranking 20th in the NBA in defensive efficiency (109.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) and 17th in offensive rating (108.0 points scored per 100 possessions). They are getting some strong individual contributions but have yet to put those together into a cohesive team attack. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

They will face a much sterner test moving forward, starting with three games against the Bucks, the Lakers and the Rockets, followed by a four-game road trip out West that includes stops in Utah, Denver and Portland.

      <p>The Thunder have won four of their past five, and a big part of it has been their offensive improvement. Balance has been a big part of OKC's step forward offensively. In the bonkers overtime win against the Wolves, OKC had five 20-point scorers (the first time that's been done in the NBA since 2004), and in a quality road win over Portland, the Thunder had three more 20-point scorers. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a>'s closing instincts shined in both of those games, scoring 11 of OKC's 17 in overtime against Minnesota, and 14 in the fourth against the Blazers. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>San Antonio's first consecutive wins since October featured encouraging performances by young players who could be critical to the franchise's future. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277890/lonnie-walker-iv">Lonnie Walker IV</a>, last year's first-round pick who has yet to earn coach Gregg Popovich's trust, scored a career-high 28 points and defended <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden">James Harden</a> as well as humanly possible in Tuesday's double-overtime victory. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907497/dejounte-murray">Dejounte Murray</a>, who recently lost the starting point guard job, had 14 points and hit the winning jumper in Friday's OT win over the Kings. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>

      <p>The Kings have to be the hardest team in the NBA to figure out. In the past five games, Sacramento beat two of the West's best teams (at Dallas and against Denver) but in between lost three games against teams with losing records in San Antonio, Portland and Chicago. While the Kings have won just nine of 22 games, keep in mind that starting power forward <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277848/marvin-bagley-iii">Marvin Bagley III</a> (thumb) has yet to debut this season and starting point guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066259/de'aaron-fox">De'Aaron Fox</a> (ankle) has been out since Nov. 8. <i>-- Spears</i></p>

      <p>Their win over the 76ers really shouldn't be as surprising as it seemed, with the way they compete on a nightly basis and have the ability to score with anyone. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura">Rui Hachimura</a> had his most effective game of his young career in the win over the Sixers, showing more than enough signs of possible future stardom.

      <p>Before a 12-point, 4-for-17 performance in Sunday's loss to Atlanta, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3133601/devonte-graham">Devonte' Graham</a> was having a week to remember and was likely on the verge of being named Eastern Conference Player of the Week. In the three games before Sunday, the guard averaged a team-high 25.7 points per game on 20 attempts, 45.9% from 3, and 10 assists per game. If there were an award for coach of the year of a team below .500, James Borrego would be a candidate. Before the loss to Atlanta, Charlotte was 8-5 against teams under .500. Borrego and his staff certainly deserve credit for the play of Graham and for balancing a roster with both youth and veterans on expiring contracts. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>Long losing streaks and the recent speculation on what the future holds for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3449/kevin-love">Kevin Love</a> were to be expected from the Cavaliers this season. As for the play on the court, the Cavaliers are on a six-game losing streak, including a 47-point loss to Philadelphia on Saturday, and have gone 1-12 since Nov. 10. In those 13 games, eight of them at home, Cleveland had an average point differential of minus-16.8 overall, including minus-26.4 -- yes, that is not a misprint -- on the road. To say Cleveland has not been competitive on the road would be an understatement. As for the future of Love, the forward is under contract through the 2022-23 season with an average cap hit of $30M.<i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>We will see if there is any lasting effect of New York's one-point loss to the Pacers on Saturday night. One day after head coach David Fizdale was fired, interim head coach Mike Miller led the Knicks to their most complete performance of the season. Miller made no drastic lineup changes to a roster that had been blown out by a combined 81 points to Denver and Milwaukee in the previous two games. The difference is the Knicks competed on the defensive end of the court. New York had 11 steals, 37 defensive rebounds and 6 blocks, and held Indiana to 104 points, including a scoreless final five minutes. <i>-- Marks</i></p>
