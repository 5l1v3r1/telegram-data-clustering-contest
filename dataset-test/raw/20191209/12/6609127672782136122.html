        <b>CELTIC ace Liam Burt has shut down a Rangers fan who aimed sectarian abuse at him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The midfielder, 20, crossed the Old Firm divide earlier this year after being released by the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Light Blues</a>.</p>

      <p>And the boyhood <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> fan celebrated their Betfred Cup victory over his former club yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Sharing Celtic's tweet about being champions, he said: "Beautiful Sunday."</p>
      <p>However, a Rangers fan named Davie, with the username @Coplandfront54, then responded by aiming sectarian abuse at Burt.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "Dirty fenian b******."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But Burt was quick to reply as he simply said: "And I love it."</p>
      <p>The Rangers fan's tweet is no longer available and he appears to have deleted his account in the hours since the abuse.</p>
      <p>While the Celtic ace has made no further reference to it since then.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, talkSPORT host Alan Brazil has <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5045133/alan-brazil-alfredo-morelos-cheat-rangers-celtic-talksport/">branded Rangers star Alfredo Morelos a 'cheat'</a>.</p>
      <p>The breakfast show presenter claimed the Colombian striker falls over too easily during games.</p>
      <p>He said: "He's a cheat. Simple as that. He just falls over too easily.</p>
      <p>"He's a good player but he's got to stop cheating. Simple as that."</p>
