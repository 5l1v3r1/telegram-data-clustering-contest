      <p>Boozy all-inclusive breaks at Spanish holiday hotspots could be banned from next year under a range of hard-hitting measures to tackle troublesome tourists.</p>
      <p>Politicians are discussing plans to outlaw bad behaviour on the island of Majorca - and they could come into force as soon as next month.</p>
      <p>Under the planned new measures, holidaymakers arrested for certain offences could be sent back to their home countries immediately and businesses found to encourage excess alcohol consumption could be hit with huge fines.</p>
      <p>Under the new guidelines, bars selling booze after hours could also be slapped with extortionate fines and forced to close during the high season throughout June, July and August.</p>

      <p>Hotels will also face punishment  if they fail to swiftly kick out disruptive guests. While all-inclusive holidays could be outlawed by the authorities in a bid to change the image of the party resorts.</p>
      <p>Residents and business owners in tourist centres like Magaluf have previously slammed government authorities for half-hearted responses to the problem of drunken and offensive behaviour.</p>
      <p>One year, officers from West Midlands Police were drafted in to patrol the streets of Magaluf in a bid to crackdown on drunkenesss amongst Brits. Other unpopular measures have included a ban on music on terraces after certain times.</p>

      <p>The tough new rules are expected to be approved next January and come into force for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>Expat pub boss Paul O'Neill, who runs Sammy's Bar in Magaluf, gave his backing to the drive.</p>
      <p>"Many people do not like the all-inclusive deals. Any measures taken to help local businesses would be welcomed," he continued.</p>
