        <b>Nisaidie na chumvi kidogo, yangu imeisha tu sahii!</b>
      </p>
      <p>We all have different characteristics and personalities. This difference can make it hard for us to live with one another.</p>
      <p>Since we don’t get to decide who to live with, sometimes we find ourselves living with interesting and peculiar neighbors who can be irritating at times. Some can be good and reliable while others can be a pain in the neck, making you regret why you ever moved into the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the different types of neighbors you are likely to meet in your neighborhood.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The borrower</b>
      </p>
      <p>This type of neighbor is always running out of things; Sugar, salt, matchbox, omo, cooking oil etc. If he borrows your charger, he will take 48-hours to return it. These type of people should be grateful but you will be surprised by how rude and impolite they always are.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The fighting couple</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is the type of couple that everyone is always complaining about. When they fight, everyone will know since they are dramatic, loud and petty. They will break windows, utensils and even hurt other neighbors in the process.</p>
      <p>Every time they fight, they always vow to break up but its been 4 years now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Party freaks</b>
      </p>

        <p>They are a complete nightmare. They will throw a loud party at 1 am in the night and you will do nothing about it. They will scream and shout until your ears bleed.</p>
        <p>
          <b>The complainer</b>
        </p>
        <p>Nothing is ever good enough for this neighbor. They will always complain about everything, from the water shortages, the black outs, the crying babies, the noisy neighbors, everything. These kind of people are usually irritated easily and have a short temper.</p>
        <p>
          <b>The drug lord</b>
        </p>
        <p>You will always have that neighbor who has or can access alcohol or other types of drugs at any time. When people want to have a good time, he is the life of the party.</p>
        <p>
          <b>The one allergic to clothes</b>
        </p>
        <p>There are neighbors who get allergic to clothes when staying indoors. They will walk around in towels, or vests and tiny shorts. Others will be comfortable with a very light lesso tied on their chest. The ones with big behinds will make sure they bend a lot until you see their behinds.</p>
        <p>
          <b>The shouter</b>
        </p>

          <p>God created them with a boombox in their throat. They will greet you and all the people in the neighborhood will know that Kevo said Hi. Even when they are discussing private matters, they will shout at the top of their voices. Whenever they are not around, the building is quiet.</p>
          <p>
            <b>The player</b>
          </p>
          <p>This is the guy your mama warned you about. He might not be good looking but he always has a way with ladies.</p>
          <p>Every time this guy brings different women and mama wa ploti fear him since he chases anything in a skirt.</p>
          <p>
            <b>The homeless one</b>
          </p>
          <p>Have you ever had a neighbor who loves staying at another neighbor’s place such that you cannot even tell their house?</p>
          <p>Once they get home, they will go play FIFA, cook, gossip and watch movies at their neighbor’s place. The only time you will find them at home is when they are sleeping.</p>
          <p>
            <b>The noisy one</b>

              <b>The mysterious neighbor</b>
            </p>

              <b>The gossiper</b>
            </p>

                  <p>Some neighbors will invest in your life as if they get paid for that. They know what time you leave and the people you bring in your house. And some even know what meal you cooked on Friday evening when Jane came to visit you.</p>

                    <b>Kind hearted one</b>
