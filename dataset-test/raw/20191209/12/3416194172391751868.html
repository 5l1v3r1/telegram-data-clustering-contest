      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/hayley-kiyoko/"><b>Hayley Kiyoko</b></a> has a newfound appreciation for her heritage after a visit to Japan.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old “Girls Like Girls” singer shared her experience with her fans in a new Instagram.</p>
      <p>“When I was younger I was embarrassed of being Asian. It wasn’t ‘cool’ being different. Idk who the heck planted that seed in my brain because I LOVE BEING HALF JAPANESE AND BEING DIFFERENT IS SO POWERFUL AND LIBERATING,” <b>Hayley </b>wrote.</p>
      <p>She added a note to fans, saying “Don’t let anybody tell you otherwise.”</p>
      <p>“I am so proud to continue to learn more and more about my culture every time I visit. Japan will always have a piece of my heart. Gonna try to stay zen for as long as I can until I can visit again :) ❤️❤️.”</p>
