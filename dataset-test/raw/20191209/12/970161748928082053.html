      <h1>Ant McPartlin looking happy as larry following end of I'm A Celebrity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:52:36+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Higgins</a></address>
      <p>Having completed a successful TV comeback, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a>’s face says it all.</p>
      <p>The presenter had a huge grin on his face as he walked out for dinner with his girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>
      <p>Ant was also joined by his TV partner Dec, who was with his wife Ali Astall and daughter Isla and the bunch was no doubt celebrating the end of their presenting stint on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>The lifelong friends were out in Brisbane the day after their huge hour and a half final of the show last night.</p>

      <p>For Ant, the end of the show is all the more significant as this year was his first time back in the Australian jungle since 2017, following his break from TV last year.</p>
      <p>He pulled out of hosting in 2018 following a drink driving conviction and battles with alcohol and prescription drugs. Holly Willoughby stepped in to replace Ant on I’m A Celebrity, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/fans-loving-ant-mcpartlin-back-im-celebrity-miss-holly-willoughby-11172667/">fans are thrilled to have Ant back this year.</a></p>
      <p>Anne-Marie is Ant’s former personal assistant, who he got close to following the split from his wife Lisa Armstrong.</p>

      <p>Ant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/ant-mcpartlin-king-world-sports-gold-crown-celebrate-44th-birthday-australia-11177423/">recently celebrated his 44th birthday</a> Down Under with friends. He seemed happy and relaxed despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ant-mcpartlin-face-estranged-wife-lisa-armstrong-court-battle-hash-divorce-11073897/">reports that he is going to face his ex Lisa in court</a> to thrash out their divorce.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7679115/Ant-McPartlins-ex-Lisa-Armstrong-refuses-sign-NDA-amid-62-million-divorce-battle.html">According to MailOnline</a>, lawyers are preparing for a High Court hearing next year, which means details of the marriage may be made public. It also means any revelations about Ant’s battle to overcome his alcohol addiction will be made public.</p>
      <p>Before the hit ITV reality show started last month Ant <a href="https://www.metro.news/ant-mcpartlin-toasts-im-a-celebrity-return/1792556/">said he was excited to come back</a>: ‘I missed it last year. It’s a brilliant place to work and I’m back with my best friend,’ he said.</p>
      <p>But ratings for the 19th series have dwindled, with some fans asking for Holly Willoughby to come back. According to The Sun <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10506323/im-a-celeb-bosses-ant-dec-holly-willoughbys-ratings/">the show has lost 5 million viewers</a>.</p>
      <p>Eastenders actor Jacqueline Jossa was <a href="https://www.metro.news/jacqueline-jossa-crowned-queen-of-the-jungle-of-im-a-celebrity/1828427/">crowned queen of the jungle last night</a>.</p>
