      <h1>Bristol City's Championship rivals Leeds United set for huge £120m cash injection in promotion boost - reports</h1>
      <h2>It could play a big part in the January transfer window</h2>

      <p>Paris Saint-Germain's Qatari owners are reportedly on the verge of sealing a potential £120m takeover of Leeds United.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/psg-owners-on-verge-securing-21050192">The Mirror</a> report that <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City's</a> Championship rivals are set to receive around£10m for a stake in the Elland Road club, which would allow them to complete the takeover if Leeds are promoted to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Leeds have been in terrific form this season and experts rank their chances of promotion highly.</p>

      <p>Current owner Andrea Radrizzani wants £80m to sell the club now but that fee would go up by £40m if the club are promoted.</p>
      <p>It is believed that Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) see the added sum as worth paying, instead of taking an £80m risk now following a string of unsuccessful promotion bids.</p>
      <p>Buying a stake in the club now would act as a deposit for a full takeover should the club get promoted.</p>
      <p>However, in the short term, it will create added money for Marcelo Bielsa to spend in January.</p>
      <p>It could be bad news for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City,</a> with both clubs said to be keen on a striker and the Whites suddenly having extra spending power.</p>
