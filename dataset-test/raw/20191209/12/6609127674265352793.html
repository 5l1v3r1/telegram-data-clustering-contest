        <b>JOHN HARTSON has dismissed Rangers' complaints over Celtic's offside goal with a throwback to his own disallowed strike.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> legend wrongly had a goal chopped off for offside in the 2-1 defeat to the Light Blues in the 2003 League Cup Final.</p>

      <p>And he has now blasted the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Ibrox club</a> and their fans' criticism of Christopher Jullien's winner as "sour grapes".</p>
      <p>The Frenchman appeared to be in an offside position when he fired the ball past Gers keeper Allan McGregor at Hampden yesterday.</p>
      <p>Now, Hartson has posted a picture of the moment Henrik Larsson passed the ball to him before his goal in the 2003 final, showing him to be onside.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "Sour grapes!"</p>

      <p>Many Celtic fans agreed with Hartson.</p>
      <p>@AllezMadone said: "Sent this to my Rangers supporting mates earlier JH. The silence was deafening!"</p>
      <p>@Lukesagooner added: "Never forget."</p>
      <p>While @Stlucia04 simply replied: "Exactly John."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, talkSPORT host Alan Brazil has <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5045133/alan-brazil-alfredo-morelos-cheat-rangers-celtic-talksport/">branded Rangers star Alfredo Morelos a 'cheat'</a>.</p>
      <p>The breakfast show presenter claimed the Colombian striker falls over too easily during games.</p>
      <p>He said: "He's a cheat. Simple as that. He just falls over too easily.</p>
      <p>"He's a good player but he's got to stop cheating. Simple as that."</p>
