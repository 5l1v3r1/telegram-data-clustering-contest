        <b>Kids campaign leads to proposed 40kmh speed limit outside school</b>
      </p>
      <p>Children have helped convince a regional council to lower speed limits outside their school and cut the chances of being "squished".</p>
      <p>Tua Marina School students took their clipboards to the street, surveyed parents, tallied the result, and made a submission to the Marlborough District Council's speed limit review.</p>

      <p>Online maps showed the school, about 10 kilometres north of Blenheim, is surrounded by two 100kmh zones, an 80kmh zone and a railway line.</p>
      <p>Now, the council has proposed dropping speed limits at Tuamarina to 40kmh as part of a push to make the region's roads safer.</p>
      <p>Marlborough Roads manager Steve Murrin said this included Blind Creek Rd and parts of Hunter Rd, which had 80kmh limits, and Campbells Rd and Cotterill St - which bordered the school. They currently had "undefined speed limits", so were 100kmh zones.</p>
      <p>The proposal comes as the Government last week announced it would lower speed limits surrounding schools to a maximum of 40kmh in urban areas and 60kmh in rural areas from mid-2020, with roll outs to occur over the next decade.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) said there were 323 schools in New Zealand by roads with 100kmh speed limits.</p>
      <p>Motorists were currently required to drive 40kmh at schools, but only when children were going to or from school, or when children were around.</p>
      <p>But Tua Marina School student Frank Brought, 9, said it was not enough.</p>
      <p>"A young child could walk to their parent's car on the road and a car could come speeding up the road at 100kmh and squish the small child," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think the speed limit on Campbells Rd is very, very dangerous."</p>
      <p>Henry Nott, 8, said animals, such as cattle, often crossed Campbells Rd.</p>
      <p>"Also, people walk their dogs and there are people playing [the children's game] fox and hound, and there is a high crash rate," he said.</p>

      <p>New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) data showed there had been nine crashes within 100 metres of the school since 2001, but none were fatal.</p>
      <p>A total of 560 people and organisations submitted to the council's review of speed limits along local roads. More than 50 of those were from Tuamarina.</p>
      <p>Tua Marina School principal Nick Raynor said the school submitted to the review in support of their students, and requested speed reductions.</p>
      <p>Canvastown School also had a 100kmh zone on its front door, in the form of State Highway 6, but the speed limit was being reviewed by NZTA, not council.</p>

      <p>Tuamarina resident Neville Ham, who submitted on the speed limit review, said he'd used a forklift to move about three cars off the roads after crashes.</p>
      <p>"I once saw a car upside down at the church here. The driver told me she was only doing 50kmh, but you can't bowl a car over only doing 50kmh."</p>
      <p>Ham, who has lived in Tuamarina for 60 years, said narrow roads, vehicle blind spots, and a high number of speedsters made the area a hazard.</p>
      <p>"At school times, it's just chaos. I worked in the dairy (company), which has since burnt down, and used to sit in the office looking over the intersection. I've seen some pretty hairy stuff. There's been a lot of close calls," he said.</p>
      <p>Tuamarina and Waikakaho Residents and Ratepayers Association chairman Greg Woolley, who made a personal submission to the review, said he had seen five crashes or near misses during his time in Tuamarina.</p>
      <p>"In each of those, speed was most probably a factor," he said.</p>
      <p>He said most residents were unhappy with the village's 80kmh speed limits.</p>
      <p>A report presented at the council's assets and services committee last month said submissions mostly supported speed reductions across the region.</p>
      <p>It suggested a region-wide approach to speed limits, rather than reviewing individual roads.</p>
      <p>A draft speed bylaw would be presented to the council early next year, the report said, and would go out for public consultation in February 2020.</p>
