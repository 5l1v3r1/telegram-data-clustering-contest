      <p>The day has come when India customers will finally be able to purchase the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Vivo">Vivo</a> V17. Back in the Summer, we saw the birth of Vivo V17 Neo, followed by Vivo V17 Pro in September. Back in the last month, the company released the V17 in Russia, but it’s a different smartphone with a diamond-shaped camera design. Now, we have an L-shaped camera handset with the same V17 moniker.</p>
      <h3>Vivo V17 specifications</h3>
      <p>Despite the obvious differences in design, the V17 has the same Snapdragon 675 SoC coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The L-shaped camera comprises four shooters. The main one is a 48MP module that comes along with an 8MP ultra-wide angle module. Completing the camera package we have a 2MP depth sensor with another 2MP camera for macro shots.</p>

      <p>Vivo V17 boasts a 6.55-inch OLED panel with a punch-hole design serving as a house for the 32MP f/2.0 front-facing sensor. The display has a FullHD+ resolution and slim bezels. The handset draws power from a 4,500mAh battery that charges with 18W fast-charging. The software department is run by Android 9 Pie which has FunTouch 9.2 running atop.</p>
