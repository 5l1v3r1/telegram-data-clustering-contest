      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> was sacked last month after overseeing a poor start to the Premier League season, with former player <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/freddie-ljungberg/"><b>Freddie Ljungberg</b></a> installed as interim manager.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/josh-kroenke/"><b>Josh Kroenke</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raul-sanllehi/"><b>Raul Sanllehi</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/edu/"><b>Edu</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/huss-fahmy/"><b>Huss Fahmy</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vinai-venkatesham/"><b>Vinai Venkatesham</b></a> met to discuss Arsenal's strategy for the rest of the season and the list of candidates they had drawn up to replace Emery.</p>
      <p>The report states that Arsenal are still considering a number of different candidates for the role, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikel-arteta/"><b>Mikel Arteta</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carlo-ancelotti/"><b>Carlo Ancelotti</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/massimiliano-allegri/"><b>Massimiliano Allegri</b></a> all in the frame.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have endured their worst run in 42 years during recent weeks, with faith in interim Ljungberg reportedly diminishing among the executives.</p>
      <p>The Gunners travel to West Ham United on Monday for their next Premier League fixture, knowing a win would take them to within two points of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">fifth-placed Manchester United</a>.</p>
