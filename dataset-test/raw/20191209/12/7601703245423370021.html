      <h3>Prabhas's Jaan</h3>
      <p>Nevertheless, if the reports regarding the project turn out to be true, there are high chances for the film to be Prabhas's next after Jaan with Radhakrishna Mohan. Jaan's next schedule of shoot is yet to commence and it is being reported that the team will shoot the major portions of the film in Ramoji Rao Film City.</p>
      <p>Well, we have to wait for an official announcement regarding the pan-Indian project in the offing. Meanwhile, Mythri Movie Makers has already launched their next venture, which will be helmed by director Sukumar. The film, featuring Allu Arjun in the lead, is expected to go on floors soon.</p>
