      <h1>‘This is a tragedy’: Russia anti-doping chief says no chance of winning appeal against four-year ban</h1>

      <p>The head of Russia’s anti-doping agency said Monday that his country had “no chance” of winning an appeal against a four-year international <a href="https://scroll.in/field/946290/no-tokyo-olympics-no-qatar-world-cup-russia-handed-four-year-ban-from-sporting-events-by-wada">sporting ban</a> he said was a tragedy for clean athletes.</p>
      <p>“There is no chance of winning this case in court,” RUSADA chief Yury Ganus told AFP after the World Anti-Doping Agency imposed the ban.</p>
      <p>RUSADA’s supervisory board is set to meet on December 19 to take a decision on whether to appeal the ban, he said.</p>
      <p>“This is a tragedy,” he said. “Clean athletes are seeing their rights limited.”</p>
      <p>Ganus said that some Russian athletes were contemplating leaving Russia so that they could train elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He described the sentiments among athletes as “awful,” stressing that four years for a sportsman is a long time.</p>
      <p>Earlier Monday Wada’s executive committee, meeting in Lausanne, decided that Russia be handed a four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory data.</p>
      <p>Russian athletes have already faced a series of bans over the last few years and were forced to participate in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games as neutral competitors.</p>
