      <p>Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby continued as normal on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> despite reports that some<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/phillip-schofield-breaks-silence-following-claims-morning-presenters-complain-attitude-11410682/"> presenters have ‘complained about Phil’s behaviour’</a>.</p>
      <p>The hosts returned to front the show and didn’t mention allegations that their partnership is strained, with the episode kicking off with them both sat on a Ferris wheel outside the London studios.</p>
      <p>Holly and Phil were joined by the likes of Aled Jones, Russell Watson and Martin Lewis over the course of the shows two hours.</p>
      <p>According to reports made by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10499882/phillip-schofield-holly-ruth-this-morning-war/">The Sun</a>, Phil’s relationship with his co-host Holly has become strained over recent months with the publication also alleging that Ruth Langsford has made an official complaint about the king of daytime television’s attitude.</p>
      <p>They also claim a number of ITV presenters have spoken to them about the allegedly ‘toxic’ atmosphere at This Morning, with one household name reportedly saying: ‘For so long people have been silenced because they are scared for their job.</p>

      <p>‘If they speak out publicly about the atmosphere they fear there could be repercussions.’</p>
      <p>It comes after rumours Phil got Amanda Holden banned from presenting the show. Phil and Holly also apparently clashed when she won a Bafta for filling in for Ant McPartlin on I’m A Celebrity, which Phil didn’t want her to celebrate on This Morning.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for ITV said: ‘It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.</p>
      <p>‘Phillip is a much-respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise.</p>
      <p>‘Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off-screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Martin Frizell, Editor of This Morning added: ‘I spend hundreds of days a year in their company and what you see is what you get, a genuine friendship from a couple who are both spontaneously funny and professional.</p>
      <p>‘We have the smartest viewers watching telly and believe me they would be the first to notice any issues – they haven’t because there are none.’</p>
