      <p>A national outdoor clothing chain looks set to join one of Devon's busiest high streets.</p>
      <p>A planning application has been submitted to North Devon Council requesting permission to erect signs for a <a href="https://fave.co/2PFDmNt">Millets</a> store at a former building society premises.</p>
      <p>The plans for 85 High Street in Barnstaple, formerly a branch of Nationwide, were submitted last week.</p>
      <p>The application came from JD Sports Fashion, which owns the Millets brand having bought the company back in 2012.</p>

      <p>There are two applications - one for listed building consent and a standard application, both requesting the siting of five signs at the premises.</p>
      <p>The artists impression above shows what the shop could look like after the work has taken place.</p>
      <p>In a design and access statement submitted with the plans, it says: "The building is a rendered 3-storey building located on the corner of High Street and Cross Street, Bridgeport.</p>
      <p>"The fascia signs will be installed above the windows, in the former positions of previous occupant fascia signage, on the High Street and Cross Street elevations.</p>
      <p>"The design concept for the signage takes account of the character of the building and its surroundings, and is similar in style/concept to the signage of neighbouring retail stores. The sign design uses black fascia backgrounds with simple brand identity and strapline in white and green.</p>
      <p>"The signage is not cluttered and is sizes appropriate to the building and locality."</p>

      <p>The former Barnstaple high street Nationwide branch closed back in 2017 when the building society moved to a new location in Green Lanes Shopping Centre.</p>
      <p>JD Sports opened its first store in Barnstaple back in November 2016 at the former Cargo store in the high street.</p>
      <p>The plans for the Millets signage are under consultation by the authority until January 5, 2020.</p>
