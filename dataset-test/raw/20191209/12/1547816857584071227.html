        <b>Bigg Boss 13’s housemate Asim Riaz’s brother Umar Riaz, has become known among social media users. The housemate’s brother, taking to his Twitter handle expressed what would happen if he is ever locked in a room with Sidharth Shukla, who is violent and Paras Chhabra, who disrespects woman? And the hypothetical solution is hilarious</b>
      </p>
      <p>With social media often trending with hashtags such as #Asimwinninghearts #LoneWarriorAsim #Unstoppableasim, it's very evident that Bigg Boss 13 housemate Asim Riaz has become a household name for the viewers by now. Also drawing our attention besides these social media trends is Asim’s brother Umar Riaz’s take on certain situations in the house and his strong stand for his brother. Sometimes he reminds us of Kangana Ranaut’s sister Rangoli Chandel who slams her haters and keeps her fans updated about the actress’ work. #JustSaying!</p>
      <p>Taking to his Twitter handle, Umar tweeted, “One guy who talks about girls figure and disrespects them and talks about people’s status and the other guy who knows nothing but violence put in a secret room together. All I can imagine is the vibe of the room!contd!” Following came his another Tweet that read, “If I was there I would be like “Bigboss what is the procedure to change the room” These Tweets of his, clearly pointed out at housemates Paras Chhabra and Sidharth Shukla. While he clearly stated of Paras disrespecting the female housemates; Sidharth for being that housemate, who doesn’t understand anything but violence.
