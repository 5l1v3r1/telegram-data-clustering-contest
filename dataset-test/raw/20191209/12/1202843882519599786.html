      <p>The Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy (SC) recently celebrated health and safety milestones at two FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 infrastructure projects: Al Thumama Stadium and the training sites being developed for the tournament.</p>
      <p>A total of 15 million safe work hours have been achieved on the projects: 10 million at Al Thumama Stadium and 5 million at the training sites. No injuries occurred at either site to cause construction to be halted.</p>
      <p>The milestones were celebrated by the SC and its various contractors, which organised award ceremonies for the workers involved. </p>
      <p>Abdulla Al Bishri, the SC's Health &amp; Safety Manager (Assurance), said: "We are delighted that the health and safety processes and procedures we implemented have achieved outstanding results. The credit must go to our workers and the entire project team.</p>

      <p>"We will continue with our commitment to health and safety to ensure that all parties taking part in Qatar 2022 projects implement the highest levels of regulations."</p>
      <p>Al Bishri continued: "The lessons learned from the application of leading health and safety policies will be a legacy of Qatar 2022 that will carry on locally, regionally and internationally. Our approach to keeping records of our health and safety standards will be a benchmark for future projects."</p>
      <p>More than 3,500 people are currently employed at the Al Thumama Stadium construction site. Each received a certificate for their achievements, while more than 2,000 attended the appreciation ceremony. A dozen local companies are involved in the construction of the stadium, which will have a capacity of 40,000 and host matches up to the quarter-finals stage in 2022.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, two Qatari companies – Nakheel Landscapes and Gulf Contracting – are delivering the training sites, which currently employ more than 1,500 workers.</p>
      <p>Contractors involved in both projects have displayed an outstanding commitment to health and safety and worked closely with the SC to achieve this milestone.</p>
