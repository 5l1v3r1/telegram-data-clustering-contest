      <p>WOLVES HAVE CONFIRMED two arrests were made for homophobic abuse during Sunday’s Premier League match at Brighton and Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>The club have strongly condemned the behaviour of the individuals involved and are offering their full support to Sussex Police in a criminal investigation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.the42.ie/wolves-brighton-premier-league-newcastle-4923420-Dec2019/">Wolves drew 2-2 at AMEX Stadium on Sunday</a>, as the Premier League this weekend celebrated equality and diversity within the game with its Stonewall Rainbow Laces campaign, which aims to celebrate LGBT people within sport.</p>
      <p>“Our ethos at Wolves is about being ‘One Pack’ — an attitude our supporters are very passionate about and that extends to our relationships across the football community, regardless of rivalries on the pitch,” a statement on Wolves’ official website read.</p>
      <p>The arrests follow on from Everton confirming they were investigating alleged homophobic chants that were reported during a 3-1 victory over Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday.</p>
