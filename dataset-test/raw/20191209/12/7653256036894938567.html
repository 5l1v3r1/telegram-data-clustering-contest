      <p>Former Chief Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Siddaramaiah">Siddaramaiah</a> resigned as leader of the Congress legislature party (CLP) and Dinesh Gundu Rao quit as president of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Karnataka">Karnataka</a> Pradesh Congress Party (KPCC) owning responsibility for the party's poor showing in the bypolls.</p>
      <p>Siddaramaiah has sent in his letter of resignation to AICC president <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sonia-Gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a>, reiterating his loyalty to Gandhi as well as the party. He expressed regrets at not being able to win more seats despite making sincere efforts.</p>
      <p>The party, however, is expected to take a call on these resignations. Sources said the Congress's Karnataka unit is expected to see a shake-up soon with re-allocation of responsibilities. The party may give more responsibilities to former ministers MB Patil and DK Shivakumar, as well, and reassign responsibilities to Siddaramaiah.</p>
      <p>The swift developments followed the BJP turning in an impressive victory by winning 12 of the 15 Assembly seats the party contested in the Dec 5 byelection. The Congress received a massive drubbing. Of the 15 Assembly constituencies that faced bypolls, the Congress had earlier held 11 seats, while the JD(S) three. In the bypolls, however, the Congress could win back just two seats, while the JD(S) none from the earlier three seats it held.</p>
