      <p>Kim Kardashian has threatened to fire her older sister Kourtney from the famous family’s reality TV show.</p>
      <p>Kim is annoyed at Kourtney for not being available enough for filming with Keeping Up With the Kardashians.</p>
      <p>Both Kim and sister Khloe feel frustrated with Kourtney for not being open enough about her love life on the show.</p>

      <p>In new clips from last night’s KUWTK episode, Khloe described how she hadn’t wanted ex partner Tristan Thompson’s infidelity to be public knowledge, but she had chosen to film her response for KUWTK as it’s “her job.”</p>
      <p>“Our job is being open and honest and sharing a lot of ourselves,” Kim reiterated.</p>
      <p>“And it just seems like for the past few years now, Kourtney really hasn’t been open about her personal life on camera.”</p>

      <p>“All of the days that Kourtney isn’t filming, Khloé and I are picking up the slack,’ she said.</p>
      <p>“If we’re not sharing our lives, then, what is the show?”</p>
      <p>Khloe complained to momager Kris:</p>
      <p>“They get all my cheating stuff, they get all this other stuff that I wish would go away, that I’m stripped in the blogs for being the most pathetic human being, ’cause all they talk about is what a loser I am.”</p>
      <p>“Is it my job?”she considered. “Sure. I take one for the family team.”</p>

      <p>Kim went on to call Kourtney, and threaten her with firing from the show if she didn’t share more and be more available for filming.</p>
      <p>“We have a proposal for you. It starts with an F and ends with D,” she told her sister over the phone.</p>
      <p>Kim later said: “She doesn’t want to show up, she doesn’t want to work, she has too many f*cking boundaries, she’s out.”</p>

      <p>However, Kourtney was unmoved by Kim’s threats.</p>
      <p>“My sisters are pretty nosy when it comes to anything in my life, and I like to keep certain things private. I don’t like to share about, you know, dating.”</p>
      <p>Khloe and Kim then followed their sister to find out where she was going and who she was seeing, before being busted by Kourt.</p>
      <p>“If they wanted privacy, I would never follow them or like, expose them,” she fumed.</p>

      <p>“We’re all different, and this is the kind of stuff that makes me feel that they put the show over me and my well-being and protecting me, and just me as a person.”</p>
      <p>The Poosh founder last month announced that she is taking a step back from the show.</p>
