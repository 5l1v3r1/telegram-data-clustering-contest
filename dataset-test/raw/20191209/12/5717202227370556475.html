      <h2>Jordan Henderson provided the assist for Liverpool’s opener.</h2>

      <p>BBC pundit Garth Crooks was full of praise for Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson after the weekend.</p>
      <p>Henderson’s performance against Bournemouth earned him a place in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50706000">Crooks’ Team of the Week feature on the BBC website</a>. Crooks called Henderson “outstanding” and praised his “sensational” assist.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old produced an excellent pass to unlock the Bournemouth defence and make it 1-0. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was the grateful recipient, opening the scoring on the way to a big win.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50706000">Writing in his weekly feature for BBC Sport</a>, Crooks said: “This player has been outstanding for Liverpool during the past few weeks and continued his excellent form against a Bournemouth side that were never in Liverpool’s class.</p>
      <p>“Jordan Henderson’s pass for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to score was sensational. It might have helped the Cherries if they had a player within 10 feet of the Liverpool captain. Henderson may not be the most adroit practitioner with the ball at his feet but even he will kill you if you give him that much room. The Reds go marching on.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Henderson’s role in this Liverpool team is often overlooked. He does not have the natural talent that others like Gini Wijnaldum, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah have.</p>
      <p>But his leadership, coupled with his excellent passing range, make him a useful player for Jurgen Klopp. He stepped up at the weekend and Liverpool fans will be hoping his form continues.</p>
