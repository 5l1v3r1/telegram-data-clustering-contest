      <p>Pollsters believe Wolverhampton South West and West Bromwich West are likely to be taken by the Conservatives at this week's election.</p>
      <p>However, pro-EU campaign group Best for Britain says a small shift to Labour from those planning to vote for the Liberal Democrats could ensure they stay red.</p>
      <p>In areas where the Lib Dems are unlikely to win seats, such as the Black Country, it has been suggested the best hope supporters have of denying a Conservative victory is to vote for Labour instead.</p>
      <p>Labour's Eleanor Smith is defending a slim majority in Wolverhampton South West, which has been a classic swing seat in recent elections.</p>
      <p>It would be something of a political earthquake if the Tories take West Bromwich West. The seat has always been Labour and there is not one Conservative councillor in Sandwell.</p>
      <p>According to Best for Britain, just 182 tactical votes are needed to ensure Labour holds West Bromwich West, and 379 in Wolverhampton South West.</p>
      <p>Telford is another key target for both parties. It is currently held by the Conservatives but 1,485 tactical votes would see it taken by Labour, according to the research.</p>
