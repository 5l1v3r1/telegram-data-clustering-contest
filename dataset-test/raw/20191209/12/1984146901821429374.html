      </figure>
      <p>Newcastle United swiped back-to-back wins with a comeback win against Southampton.</p>
      <p>On a strange afternoon when Andy Carroll was the game changer, Newcastle ceded possession and turned in a listless display for most of the match before goals from Jonjo Shelvey and Federico Fernandez earned a win that moved United into the top ten.</p>
      <p>It was a difficult one to break down: Newcastle didn’t play well but they exhibited the characteristics that have become this team’s hallmark – character, consistency and a refusal to concede defeat. Here’s the moments you may have missed.</p>
      <h3>Allan Saint-Maximin’s warm up</h3>
      <p>It was a strange sort of day for Allan Saint-Maximin: frequently the man most likely to spark Newcastle into action, he cut a slightly weary figure in the warm-up as team-mate Paul Dummett tried to gee him up and get him going.</p>
      <p>Saint-Maximin is a maverick and while he’s been in-form for Newcastle recently, Steve Bruce admits he’s a “free spirit” who needs to be managed. It was a quieter day by his standards before a couple of turbo-charged runs were the only sign of black and white life for that lethargic 60 minute opening spell.</p>
      <p>He'll be missed if - as feared - <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/major-injury-worry-allan-saint-17384845">he's out for a few weeks</a> .</p>
      <h3>Andy Carroll’s slide tackle</h3>
      <p>Carroll has become Steve Bruce’s talisman this season. His substitute appearances lift the crowd and have usually prompted an uptick in performance, too.</p>
      <p>But what’s been unseen is Carroll’s defensive effort – and his slide tackle in his own half on Cedric as the game reached its conclusion drew a huge cheer from St James’ Park and suggested his contribution to seeing out the match was every bit as crucial as the wonderful cross that set up Jonjo Shelvey’s leveller.</p>
      <p>Carroll has become so crucial to Newcastle.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Jonjo Shelvey’s bullet header</h3>
      <p>Whatever else you may say about Shelvey, he rarely goes missing – even when things aren’t going for him. It may sometimes appear that way given his demeanour but bravery in a football context isn’t just about slide tackles and beating your chest. It’s also about attempting to play ambitious passes or get the ball moving forward when the rest of the team isn’t clicking and Shelvey was trying to do that.</p>
      <p>His superb headed goal from the Carroll cross showed a willingness to gamble when others might not. He is playing with a point to prove and enjoying himself.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Paul Dummett’s stitches</h3>
      <p>Newcastle were down to ten men for five minutes in the second half as Paul Dummett suffered a deep cut that needed stitches. Blood was pouring from the wound as he headed down the tunnel but he was patched up and back out to finish the defensive job swiftly.</p>
      <p>“The doctor has done a good job, he’s stitched him up in two minutes 38 seconds. It was worth the wait!” <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-bruce-press-conference-17383805">Bruce joked afterwards</a> .</p>
      <p>Dummett’s return to the first XI has been seamless in a further example of United’s defensive strength-in-depth.</p>
      <h3>Joelinton shaking his head as he goes off</h3>
      <p>It was another unhappy afternoon for Newcastle’s record signing, recalled to the side but offering precious little threat in the opposition penalty area.</p>
      <p>His confidence looks shot and his performance was far too timid – but Newcastle won’t give up on him. He looked unhappy as his number came up, shaking his head as he jogged off the field.</p>
      <p>There’s plenty of goodwill towards the Brazilian, in the stands and in the squad, but we need to see some signs soon.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Martin Dubravka’s brilliant double save</h3>
      <p>Newcastle’s goalkeeper is a man in form and a double save from Nathan Redmond which kept the scores level was further evidence of how inspirational the Slovakia international has become.</p>
      <p>Redmond couldn’t believe Dubravka had denied him in a one-on-one but then his second, acrobatic stop with one hand was almost as good. That they both came within a few seconds of each other said it all.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article17387629.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Newcastle-United-v-Southampton-FC-Premier-League.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h3>Another solid 45 minutes from Javier Manquillo</h3>
      <p>Quietly, the unheralded Javier Manquillo has been as solid as anyone in Newcastle’s impressive back five over the last few games. Excellent against Sheffield United, he delivered another decent display against the Saints – getting forward with purpose and defending resolutely.</p>
      <p>Considering he was once considered a liability, it’s been an impressive spell.</p>
      <h3>A low crowd but a decent atmosphere</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-attendance-lowest-17384224">The lowest crowd for nine years</a> prompted Steve Bruce to suggest in his press conference the club needed to “help out” somehow. And there’s no doubt they’ll be concerned about the numbers at the moment, which reveal a solid number are set on staying away.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere is suffering too: it felt flat and listless for long spells against Southampton. It’s not a negative atmosphere - far from it – but it’s far too passive at times. Something needs to be done.</p>

      <h3>Ralph Hasenhutl’s press conference</h3>
      <p>Southampton’s manager was clearly angry at the way his side had failed to capitalise on their dominance in the first hour but his jibe about Andy Carroll being “10ft tall” was a bit bizarre. Carroll’s aerial ability is hardly a secret: had Newcastle’s opponents not planned for it?</p>
      <p>And while he might have had a point that Newcastle didn’t play much football, opening his press conference with it made him look a bit bitter.</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>Sean Longstaff’s late introduction changes the game</h3>
      <p>Newcastle’s Longstaff brothers have found it difficult to get into the side of late but Sean helped turn the game with his long range effort that Alex McCarthy spilled into the path of Federico Fernandez. It was impressive intent from the older Longstaff brother, who will come back into the reckoning soon enough.</p>
      <h3>Hugs for every player from the manager</h3>
      <p>One of Steve Bruce’s big assets if you speak to his ex-players is his man management and this squad seem to be enjoying the more collegiate way that he and his coaching staff work. Rafa Benitez was popular with the players but Bruce is too, and the big personalities in the squad have taken to his style of management.</p>
      <p>He offered hugs and jokes for every player as they left the pitch.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17387183.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1192694679.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Steve Bruce on the pitch – and loving life as Newcastle boss</h3>
      <p>And the Newcastle Head Coach could be forgiven for enjoying himself at the moment. His celebration at Fernandez’s goal – running onto the pitch with fists clenched – illustrated just how much pleasure he’s taking from these wins.</p>
      <p>While he wasn’t the popular choice to take over, it would take a hard heart to begrudge him these moments.</p>
      <h3>A compliment from Gary Lineker</h3>
      <p>Gary Lineker took to social media after the win to proclaim Bruce an “excellent” manager, lightly chiding the critics who had doubted him.</p>
      <p>Bruce was humble about that in his own press conference: “I’d like to think I can hold my own. I’ve done 900-odd games. Whether I’m excellent, I’m not sure about that, but I’m competent, that’s for sure.</p>
