      <p><b>Mubasher:</b> Sanofi on Monday said it will take over US biotechnology company Synthorx in a cash deal that valued the latter at $2.5 billion, according to a press release.</p>
      <p>The French pharmaceutical major aims to boost its pipeline of treatment for cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p>
      <p>Under the deal, which was unanimously approved by boards of both companies, Sanofi will pay $68 per each outstanding Synthorx share.</p>
      <p>This represents a 172% premium to Synthorx’s closing share price on Friday’s session.</p>
      <p>“This acquisition […] is aligned with our goal to build our oncology franchise with potentially practice-changing medicines and novel combinations,” Sanofi’s CEO Paul Hudson said.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that Synthorx a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on therapies for people with cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p>
      <p>The acquisition would boost Sanofi’s immuno-oncology franchise, with Synthorx’s lead product, THOR-707, which is currently under clinical development, having the potential to be the best therapy for solid tumors.</p>
      <p>The transaction is set to be concluded on in the first quarter of next year, Sanofi said.</p>
