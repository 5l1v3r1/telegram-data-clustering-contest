      <p>Billionaire Phones 4U founder John Caudwell told shadow chancellor John McDonnell today that he was considering leaving the country if the Labour Party wins Thursday’s General Election. </p>

      <p>Caudwell hit out at McDonnell’s recent statements on the rich and at Labour’s tax plans.</p>
      <p>“When I hear words like, or phrases like, ‘nobody deserves to be a billionaire’ and phrases like ‘we’re going to tax high technology companies’, it frightens the living daylights out of me and out of society,” he said.</p>
      <p>McDonnell replied:  “I’ve actually said I do pay tribute to those people, the entrepreneurs, who create the wealth, who pay their taxes and act responsibly, I do that every time.</p>
      <p>“But is it about having a fair taxation system as well.”</p>

      <p>Caudwell said: “We need to encourage people to be inspired, to be successful and to make Britain great. </p>
      <p>“To create the money but we also need to inspire them to stay onshore to pay the taxes, to pay fair taxes and to be charitable.”</p>
      <p>Caudwell, who is worth £1.5bn, said he had paid over £300m in taxes in the past 10 years.</p>
      <p>Caudwell made more than £1.2bn in 2006 through the sale of the mobile phone business he started.</p>
