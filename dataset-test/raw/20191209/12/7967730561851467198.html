      <h1>Ending right to block private schools hailed as a win over 'red tape'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:45:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Carey and Sumeyya Ilanbey</a></address>
      <p>Residents will lose the right to object to the building of new private schools under planning laws designed to "fast-track" the development of the Catholic and independent sectors.</p>
      <p>Planning laws gazetted last week have removed the right of third parties to challenge non-government school constructions at VCAT, a change the government says will “reduce red tape”.</p>

      <p>The state government made the move after lobbying by planning consultant Urbis on behalf of more than 20 elite private schools, including Camberwell Grammar, Caulfield Grammar, Scotch College and Trinity Grammar.</p>
      <p>In its submission to the government, Urbis said independent and Catholic schools were bogged down by local government bureaucracy and that applications were taken to VCAT by residents over "relatively minor matters".</p>
      <p>The changes are intended to support an expected student boom of more than 110,000 extra Victorian students in the next three years. About 37 per cent of Victorian students attend a Catholic or independent school.</p>
      <p>Applications will now be assessed by the Planning Minister, in line with the process for government schools, with decision-making taken out of the hands of councils.</p>

      <p>"These changes will reduce red tape and make it quicker and easier to deliver the significant upgrades our non-government schools need," Planning Minister Richard Wynne said.</p>
      <p>"We’re ensuring we have the right community and education infrastructure for our growing population."</p>
      <p>In its submission on behalf of private schools, Urbis said that time delays caused by the council planning process were a "key issue facing schools".</p>
      <p>"When time frames are known in advance, schools can plan around the school curriculum to limit disruption to classes and school activities. However, when delays are unexpected it causes significant disruption to school operations."</p>
      <p>Urbis said appeals to VCAT caused delays and were costly to councils and schools, and argued the complaints by objectors were about noise from schoolchildren playing and traffic during drop-off and pick-up times.</p>
      <p>"The planning system does not reflect the importance of education over minor inconveniences such as additional traffic for half an hour or so in the morning and afternoon," the submission stated.</p>
      <p>Education Minister James Merlino hailed the changes as a win for students.</p>

      <p>"Every student deserves access to modern school facilities and with more than a third of Victorian students attending non-government schools we’re making sure they benefit from our record investment," Mr Merlino said.</p>
      <p>The announcement follows the government’s pre-election promise to alter planning laws to cut red tape and create a dedicated unit within the Department of Planning to help fast-track non-government school approvals for new schools and upgrades.</p>
      <p>The schools eligible for these planning changes are those that will receive support from the $400 million Non-Government Schools Capital Fund.</p>
      <p>The first schools to benefit from the changes are expected to be announced this month.</p>
