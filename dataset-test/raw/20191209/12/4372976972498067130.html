      <p>"Behind the Wheel" is a video series that shows you a bit of what it’s like to work at <i>Autoblog</i>. The editors and video producers will show you the cars we have in our fleet, and you’ll get a behind the scenes look at some of the personalities that help make the site run. </p>
      <p>Episode 5 features Senior Producer Christopher McGraw and the refreshed 2019 Jeep Cherokee. It loses the slender headlights for a more mainstream look, one that is sure to appeal to more buyers, but does it appeal to this reviewer?</p>
      <p>Do you like the old look or the new look of the Jeep Cherokee? Is it worth $42k to you? What cars do you want to see in our fleet? We’d love to hear from you, so please comment below!</p>
