      <p>High street giant Topman has been hit with criticism for 'glamorising violence' by selling mock stab vests.</p>
      <p>Topman is selling a range of 'tactical vests' under Parisian fashion brand, Sixth June, from £45 to £55.</p>
      <p>Anti-knife campaigners blasted the London fashion house for sending out wrong images.</p>
      <p>A record of 22,306 knife offences have been recorded in England and Wales in 12 months to June, according to figures released by the Ministry of Justice.</p>

      <p>Last Friday, two victims were stabbed to death by London Bridge killer Usman Khan.</p>
      <p>Richard Taylor, father of a 10-year-old schoolboy who was stabbed in 2000 in a killing, said: "I'm totally disappointed that fashion houses like Topman should be selling such a vest.</p>
      <p>"I am totally against it, especially selling it at this critical time and simply to make money. They want young people to buy it.</p>

      <p>"They should not be glamorising this culture - we are fighting tooth and nail against knife violence and are mourning the death of two young people last week."</p>
      <p>Anti-knife campaigner Jen Lock, from Lives Instead of Knives, said: "It's totally irresponsible. Where do these people come up with these ideas?</p>
      <p>"That is feeding off the UK's knife crime epidemic and someone is trying to make money out of it.</p>
      <p>"It's exploiting young people and promoting what the rest of us are trying to discourage or turn people away from."</p>
      <p>One of the pieces features a boxy-cut design and multiple pockets at the front with Valcro tape closing.</p>
      <p>Another one resembles a look of a bullet-proof vest with secure clasp on the sides of the vest.</p>
      <p>Sixth June writes in the description: "This item is non professional and does not protect from bullets."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Topman for comment.</p>
