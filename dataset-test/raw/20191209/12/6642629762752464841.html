      <p>A senior North Korean official called President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> a "heedless and erratic old man", resuming insults of the American leader that were set aside during a rare thaw in relations.</p>
      <p>Kim Yong Chol, a governing party vice chairman, launched the strongest salvo yet in a war of words that has rekindled in recent days.</p>
      <p>He rebuked the US president over his own rhetoric and pointed to remarks by Trump on Sunday that North Korean leader <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/kim-jong.html">Kim Jong Un</a> had "far too much to lose".</p>
      <p>Those comments indicated Trump is "an old man bereft of patience", the North Korean official said.</p>
      <p>"The time when we cannot but call him a 'dotard' again may come. We have nothing more to lose," a statement carried in state news agency KCNA quoted Kim Yong-chol as saying.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/North-Korea.html">North Korea</a> had lauded a "special relationship" between Trump and Kim even as it criticised other US officials and their "gangster-like" demands during deadlocked talks.</p>
      <p>However, Pyongyang bristled last week after Trump again referred to Kim as "Rocket Man", a nickname the president used early in his term.</p>
      <h3>Exchanging insults</h3>
      <p>Tensions have been rising in recent weeks as a year-end deadline, set by North Korea for Washington to soften its stance in negotiations, approaches. Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and issued strongly-worded statements.</p>
      <p>Though Trump regularly exchanged insults with North Korea in the first years of his term, both sides abandoned personal attacks after Trump met Kim in Singapore in 2018.</p>
      <p>Kim Yong-chol - who was instrumental in arranging a failed second Trump-Kim summit in February - said the country's leader may change his views towards Trump if the president continues uttering "inappropriate, highly risky words and expressions".</p>
      <p>On Sunday, North Korea carried out what it called a "very important" test at its Sohae satellite launching station, a rocket-testing ground that US and South Korean officials once said Pyongyang had promised to shut down.</p>
      <p>Commercial satellite images taken on Saturday by Planet Labs showed vehicles and equipment likely to be used in a rocket engine experiment, said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.</p>
      <p>"They are mostly gone on December 8 but the ground appears to have been disturbed by the exhaust from the test," Lewis said, citing photo imagery.</p>
      <p>Asked on Monday if it had been an engine test, a spokeswoman for <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/South-Korea.html">South Korea</a>'s defence ministry said site monitoring and detailed analyses were under way with US intelligence authorities.</p>
      <p>Kim has warned he might take a "new path" if the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-States.html">United States</a> fails to address his demands.</p>
      <p>Observers have said that path might include the launch of a space satellite, which would help North Korea demonstrate progress in its rocket capabilities without returning to overt military provocations such as firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).</p>
      <p>Kim Yong-chol, the North Korean official, said Trump should try to "stop the second-hand" of a clock ticking towards conflict, instead of sticking to "bluffing and hypocrisy that sound rather abnormal and unrealistic".</p>
      <p>"We have no intention to reconsider what we should do in the future, and will not feel worried about our future action," he said in the English-language dispatch on KCNA.</p>
      <p>Some South Korean analysts said North Korea might have tested a solid-fuel rocket engine, which could allow it to field ICBMs that are easier to hide and faster to deploy.</p>
      <p>"They may well have tried to see the thrust and duration of a solid-propellant rocket engine for ICBMs," a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters news agency. "That's effectively what they can do on the ground at this point without firing anything into the air."</p>
