      <p>"Both in my opinion are signs of an immature &amp; insecure mindset that wishes to glorify certain misplaced aberrations of life as disguised accomplishments as there aren't any already &amp; if past is any indication there isn't any possibility of good sense prevailing in near future."</p>

      <p>"Bilkul sahi Maa'm. I was watching the show and felt very uneasy. I think more than Sanjay Dutt, it Kapil Sharma who is responsible. He should know that whole family watches it. Is it something to publicly boast about in a civil society."</p>

      <h3>@RohanM50290080</h3>
      <p>"@Dipannitasharma #KapilSharmashow is the cheapest show hosted on Indian television. People laugh at jokes on discrimination, insults and body shaming. Yet such shows run with high TRP. IQ of its audiences are questionable."</p>
