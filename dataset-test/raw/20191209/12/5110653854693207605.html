      <p>Anthony Joshua didn't let exacting revenge get in the way of his common sense.</p>
      <p>He flicked his jab to near perfection, keepingAndy Ruiz Jr. at bay and negating the Destroyer'shand speed and pressure to deliver a boxing clinic andbecome a two-time world unified heavyweight champion. Fighting the smart fight gave Joshua a unanimous decision victory, as judges scored it 118-110, 118-110 and 119-109 at the Diriyah Arena in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday. Sporting News had it 118-110 for Joshua.</p>
      <p>"The first time was so nice, I had to do it twice," Joshua exclaimed in the ring. "I just wanted to put on a great master's class."</p>
      <p>He added: "Sometimes with certain fighters, you have to box smarter as well. I understand what Andy brings to the table, so you have to decapitate him in another way."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Joshua then evoked Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s mantra by reminding fans that boxing is about hitting and not getting hit.</p>
      <p>Well, he did that to near perfection Saturday, using his left jab to keep Ruiz atbay. Joshua, who came in 10 pounds lighter, combined the jab with great movement with his feet, which further frustrated Ruiz.</p>
      <p>The defeated Ruiz said it was Joshua's night, but admitted he didn't do his best job preparing for this bout, entering the rematch 15 pounds heavier.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I prepared as I should've," said Ruiz, attempting to rile upcause for a trilogy fight."I gained too much weight."</p>
      <p>Joshua, behind the jab and bounce in his step, didn'tallow the pressuring Ruiz to mount any damaging offense, as Ruiz's fast hands, but also slow feet were on full display.</p>
      <p>Here's how the entire "Clash on the Dunes" card went (all times Eastern):</p>

      <p><b>Round 12: </b>Massive right hand detonated from Joshua and he's right back to sticking and moving. Ruiz has had no answers for AJ. Ruiz swinging and missing. Ruiz telling Joshua to fight in the middle of the ring, but it's way too late for that. Joshua dominated and should cruise to the win to become a two-time world champ. (10-9 Joshua, 118-110 Joshua)</p>
      <p><b>Round 11: </b>This has to be extremely frustrating for Ruiz, who is working hard to get inside, but is being held at bay due to Joshua's jab and movement. Here comes the final round. Ruiz has to throw everything he hasto have a shot. (10-9 Joshua, 108-101 Joshua)</p>

      <p><b>5 p.m.: </b>Joshua in complete control.</p>
      <p><b>Round 10: </b>Joshua's snapping jab has been a thing of boxingbeauty this fight, as he banks another round with that as his main weapon and his feet dancing around and handling the rest. The 10 pounds Joshua lost and the 15 lbs. Ruiz gainedsince their original fight also is on clear display here, as Joshua is the one with bounce in his step. Ruiz ... is not. And AJ is letting Ruiz know about it.(10-9 Joshua, 98-92 Joshua)</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Round 9: </b>Ruiz stalking and walking down Joshua, who snaps Ruiz' head back yet again with that left jab. That same weapon snaps the champ's head back yet again seconds later. Ruiz lands a powerful hook moments later, but AJ smiles it off, which usually means it hurt. Still, Joshua takes the round. And you've got to expect Ruiz to apply 100 percent pressure in the next round. (10-9 Joshua, 88-83 Joshua)</p>
      <p><b>Round 8: </b>Ruiz hits Joshua behind the head. The ref warns them and Ruiz seems to mouth "I'm sorry" to Joshua, who's noticeably irked. But here comes Ruiz applying pressure and landing shots. Ruiz pushes Joshua when the challenger is trying to hold. Joshua has had success on the outside, pumping the jab. The inside in the phone booth with Ruiz is where AJ will walk into trouble.(10-9 Ruiz, 78-74 Joshua)</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Round 7: </b>Joshua lands a stiff right hook, but it leaves himself open to Ruiz. Joshua escapes any damage, but has got to be careful to not stray away from this strategy and gamble because it could leave himself open to a heavy shot from the "Destroyer." (10-9 Joshua, 69-64 Joshua)</p>
      <p><b>4:45 p.m.: </b>Joshua is putting on a boxing clinic.</p>
      <p><b>Round 6: </b>Joshua evades a brief flurry and sticks his tongue out to mock Ruiz and then lands a right hand. A strong left hook blasts Ruiz, as the champ goes into the clinch. The champ, who is 16 pounds heavier than he was in their first fight, hasn't been able to plant his feet and sit on a punch yet due to Joshua keeping him at bay with his jab. It has been all Joshua halfway through this "Clash on the Dunes."(10-9 Joshua, 59-55 Joshua)</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Round 5: </b>Joshua is really chipping away at Ruiz with that jab that the champ has been eating, while continuing to move forward. A nice right hand and then back to that left hook for AJ. Joshua is showing incredible patience and discipline, but you've got to wonder how he'll respond when Ruiz mashes the dash with his pressure, which he hasn't done at full throttle just yet. (10-9 Joshua, 49-46 Joshua)</p>
      <p><b>Round 4: </b>Joshua's left jab has been his best weapon thus far, as he nails Ruiz with it again. But here comes the champ, applying pressure and piecing together a combination. A short right hook lands for Ruiz, before he digs a left to the body. Joshua returns fire with that crisp hand, but Ruiz lands a chopping right hook and the champ punches in the clinch. The champ takes this round. (10-9 Ruiz, 39-37Joshua)</p>
      <p><b>4:30 p.m.: </b>Joshua is moving exceptionally well. Can he keep it up for 12 rounds if need be?</p>
      <p><b>Round 3: </b>A hard jab from Ruiz looked to be the culprit for Joshua's cut as the replays seemed to show. Joshua boxing beautifully so far, snapping Ruiz's head back by flicking that left jab and using that to find the confidence to use his reach to wrap around a left hook to the body. Plus, he's making Ruiz miss with his movement. A fairly quiet third round in comparison to the third round of their original fight.(10-9 Joshua, 30-27 Joshua)</p>
      <p><b>Round 2: </b>Joshua moving smoothly around the ring, landing a strong left jab that snaps Ruiz's head back. Moments later, he adds a hook and yet another jab. Joshua has blood over his left eye as well, although it's unclear as to what shot caused it because he's in control early on here. Both fighters land a straight left coming in at the 10-second mark. (10-9 Joshua, 20-18 Joshua)</p>
      <p><b>Round 1:</b> Joshua showing a nice bounce and spring on his feet, feinting and trying to pump the jab. A left hook followed by a right hook grazes the head of Ruiz at about the 1:00 mark of the round. A right hook lands for Joshua and Ruiz has a cut above his left eye, with blood trickling out.Good first round for AJ. (10-9 Joshua)</p>

      <h3>Co-main event: Alexander Povetkin and Michael Hunter fight to split draw; heavyweights</h3>

      <p><b>3:30 p.m.:</b> After firing out to a lightning-quick start, Hunter slowed down due to Povetkin's power. How will judges score this one?</p>

      <p><b>Round 12: </b>Hunter with another good right hand. It's a clean landing for that right hand, as Hunter should pour it on to give judges that extra push. But he's winded himself now, holding onto Povetkin between outputs. Hunter slips and is back up, still looking tired. Both fighters gassed, as this one is close to ending. And there's the final bell. (10-9 Povetkin, 115-113 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 11: </b>Hunter goes to the body to soften up Povetkin before landing a vicious right hand, wobbling the Russian. Hunter unloads that right hand again. His best round yet. (10-9 Hunter, 106-103 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 10:</b>Hunter is not utilizing his jab enough and Povetkin is using that as an opportunity to fire off with heavy artillery. (10-9 Povetkin, 96-94 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>3:45 p.m.: </b>The winner of Ruiz-Joshua 2 will take home all this heavyweight hardware. We're 30 minutes out from that main event starting.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Round 9: </b>Stinging shot from Povetkin early in the ninth. One has to think that the longer the bout goes, the advantage will point to the younger Hunter. Let's see how the rest of this round and fight plays out. Povetkin looks to be winded, even walking to the wrong corner following the round. (10-9 Povetkin, 87-84 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 8: </b>Hunter is effective when he's moving and landing punches against Povetkin because any time he stays in the pocket, he's leaving himself open to thumping shots. A quiet, but effective eighth round for "The Bounty." (10-9 Hunter, 78-74 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 7: </b>Povetkin unloading on hooks, but Hunter lands a jab that snaps Povetkin's head back followed by a stinging body shot. Povetkin comes right back, but Hunter did enough to take the round. (10-9 Hunter, 68-65 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 6: </b>"The Bounty" doing a better job of using his legs and jabbing this round, but Povetkin is still landing his power punches enough. (10-9 Hunter, 58-56 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>3 p.m.: </b>Hunter is going to have to revert to boxing instead of standing in the pocket as a proving point.</p>
      <p><b>Round 5: </b>Hunter is sticking out his chin a second too long in the pocket and needs to be careful about Povetkin's power. Povetkin rocks Hunter with a left hook that has "The Bounty" reeling back against the ropes. Moments later, Povetkin tags Hunter again. Real heavyweight power that Hunter is dealing with here. Povetkin's best round. (10-9 Povetkin, 48-47 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 4: </b>Hunter looking extremely sharp right now, showing an excellent work rate with punches. (10-9 Hunter, 39-37 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 3: </b>Hunter making the mistake of standing in front of Povetkin too long at times and Povetkin makes him pay with some shots to put him on notice of his veteran power. (10-9 Povetkin, 29-28 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>Round 2: </b>Hunter's right hand is on the money early on. He just needs to be careful lunging while throwing it, as it could make him vulnerable to a counter from Povetkin. Just as that's being said, Povetkin catches Hunter with a big shot, as the new heavyweight wisely clinches to end the round. (10-9 Hunter, 20-18 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>2:45 p.m.: </b>Meanwhile, Ruiz and Joshua are getting taped up and ready to go backstage. Their ring walks will start in exactly an hour at 3:45 p.m. ET.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Round 1: </b>Hunter comes out blazing, putting together a combination to rattle Povetkin. He's on the attack, following through with an additional barrage of punches. How's that for coming out strong on this world stage? (10-9 Hunter)</p>
      <p><b>2:40 p.m.: </b>Hunter's lone loss entering this bout was an April 2017 unanimous decision defeat toOleksandr Usyk. Povetkin, a 2004 Olympic gold medalist and former world champ, counts losses to Anthony Joshua and Wladimir Klitschko. Povetkin is nine years Hunter's senior.</p>
      <p><b>2:30 p.m.: </b>The co-feature is up next asAlexander Povetkin takes onMichael Hunter in yet another heavyweight clash. Povetkin stands as a huge test for Hunter who's still getting his bearings in the heavyweight ranks. "The Bounty" is making one hell of an entrance at the moment.</p>
      <h3>Dillian Whyte gets the best of Mariusz Wach by unanimous decision</h3>
      <p><b>2:22 p.m.: </b>There it is: Dillian Whyte is declared the unanimous decision winner (98-93, 97-93, 97-93). Whyte says he's been through hell the last few months. He certainly boasts an impressive ring resume. Let's see if he can secure some marquee fights in 2020.</p>

      <p><b>2:20 p.m.: </b>Whyte poured it during the waning momentsof the 10th round. He should win on the cards. Not his best performance, but good enough.Let's see how judges have it.</p>
      <p><b>2:15 p.m.: </b>Whyte has gotten the best of Wach from the seventh round on with fluid, stinging punches as this fight hits the 10th and final round. But Whyte unnecessarily invited Wach to run up his punch count in that ninth frame.</p>
      <p>Backstage, Saul "Canelo" Alvarez meets up with Andy Ruiz Jr., certainly offering his best to the heavyweight champ today.</p>

      <p><b>2 p.m.: </b>Wach and Whyte very much standing in the pocket and trading shots, with Wach getting the best of "The Body Snatcher" in the fifth round. The taller Wach really landed some thudding blows in the frame. This is not the best Whyte, as he took this bout on short notice. The longer this fight goes, it might be better for Wach.</p>
      <p><b>1:55 p.m.: </b>Whyte is letting his hands go more and more as this bout continues, putting together combinations to the body and unloading on wild shots upstairs that are just missing.</p>
      <p><b>1:45 p.m.: </b>Whyte feeling Wach out and unloads on that left hook he's know for in this second round. Wach lands a right moments later, before Whyte puts together a nice flurry of punches. It's early, but you get the feeling that Whyte is about to uncork something devastatingand with bad intentions.</p>
      <p><b>1:43 p.m.: </b>Wach pressing Whyte moving forward. Whyte very much trying to find his rhythm and shake off any ring rust in this first round. He lands a strong right han to put Wach on notice of his power.</p>
      <p><b>1:35 p.m.: </b>The theme from "Jaws" hits the speakers, as Whyte stalks his way to the ring. Now, the song changes to AC/DC. Quite the contrast from"The Body Snatcher," who will look to make it 2-for-2 in 2019, as he's been clamoring for a crack at WBC titleholder Deontay Wilder.</p>

      <p><b>12:46 p.m.: </b>Hrgovic drops Molina in the second round as well, but the ref rules it a rabbit punch. Moments later, Hrgovic puts Molina down with a crunching body shot. Molina takes the count and survives that round. He spit his mouthpiece out to buy a little extra time. Smart veteran move, but one has to think that Molina won't survive much longer.</p>
      <p><b>12:45 p.m.: </b>Hrgovic dropped Molina with a strong left hook in the first round, but the ref didn't rule it as a knockdown. He definitely missed that, as Molina's knees buckled.</p>
      <p><b>12:30 p.m.: </b>Majidov sure made quick work of Little. Filip Hrgovic vs. Eric Molina will be next.</p>
      <p><b>12:20 p.m.: </b>Majidov rocking Little against the ropes and the ref has seen enough, stopping him from taking further punishment. That was definitely the right call.</p>

      <p><b>12:17 p.m.: </b>Majidov didn't waste time unloading on Little during Round 1. Let's see if he can make this a quick out. And just as that's said,Majidov drops Little with a choppy right hand. He sent Little down hard.</p>
      <p><b>12:10 p.m.: </b>Three-time amateur world championMagomedrasul Majidov just made his entrance. He'll kick off this card against Tom Little in the first of five heavyweight fights.</p>
