        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/daniel-radcliffe">“Harry Potter” star Daniel Radcliffe</a> says the media attention he faced while filming the movie franchise is just a fraction of what <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> and Prince Harry are going through.</li>
        <li>The actor added that he “feels really terrible” for the Duchess of Sussex, who only joined the royal family in 2018.</li>
        <li>“That’s why I always thought their relationship was sweet, cause I was like, ‘man, she must love you if she wants to get involved in this crazy life,” Radcliffe told <a href="https://people.com/royals/daniel-radcliffe-feels-terrible-for-duchess-of-sussex-meghan-markle/">People Now.</a></li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/daniel-radcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a> says he “feels really terrible” for <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> because of the media scrutiny she’s faced since becoming a royal.</p>
      <p>While the actor admitted he doesn’t “take a huge interest” in the royal family, Radcliffe told <a href="https://people.com/royals/daniel-radcliffe-feels-terrible-for-duchess-of-sussex-meghan-markle/">People Now</a> he is aware that “Meghan Markle is being treated to the full force of the British media.”</p>
      <p>“That’s why I always thought their relationship was sweet, cause I was like, ‘Man, she must love you if she wants to get involved in this crazy life,'” Radcliffe said, referring to Markle’s marriage to Prince Harry.</p>

      <p>“It must be insane. I cannot imagine … you know, what I have and what I went through is like a fraction of what they have and went through.</p>
      <p>“And they went through it from birth,” Radcliffe added, referring to Princes Harry and William. “They didn’t even get like, you know, 10 years like I did.</p>
      <p>“So while I’m not into the institution of the monarchy, I have a huge amount of respect and empathy for them.”</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Sussex recently said she’s struggling to deal with the fame in an <a href="https://www.insider.com/video-meghan-markle-struggles-with-media-itv-documentary-2019-10">emotional ITV interview.</a></p>
      <p>When asked how the increased media attention had affected her physical and mental health, Markle said: “Look, any woman, especially when they’re pregnant, you’re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging.</p>
      <p>“And then when you have a newborn, you know?”</p>
      <p>“Also, thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I’m OK,” she added. “But it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.”</p>
      <p>The duchess later announced plans to sue British tabloid the Mail on Sunday, after the newspaper <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-lawsuit-mail-on-sunday-prince-harry-statement-2019-10">published private excerpts from a letter she sent to her father earlier this year.</a></p>
      <p>A legal spokesperson for Markle said at the time that publishing excerpts of the letter was “part of a campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband.”</p>
