      <h1>Report: Everton and Newcastle ponder £4.2m January swoop for Matchoi Bobo Djalo</h1>
      <h2>Juventus also want Djalo.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:15:14+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Everton and Newcastle are both keen on a Portuguese wonderkid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/pacos-ferreira/noticias/everton-e-newcastle-juntam-se-a-juventus-e-podem-deixar-cinco-milhoes-em-portugal-11590037.html">According to O Jogo</a>, Everton and Newcastle are considering triggering the release clause of Matchoi Bobo Djalo. He has a buy-out clause of just €5m in his contract with Pacos de Ferreira, which roughly works out as £4.2m.</p>
      <p>Italian giants Juventus are also in the hunt to sign Djalo. The 16-year-old has attracted widespread attention from clubs across Europe and there could be a race on for his signature in January.</p>

      <p>Djalo has already played three times for the Pacos de Ferreira first-team. This season, he made his debut in August, featuring for 18 minutes in the 5-0 loss against Benfica in the Primeira Liga.</p>
      <p>Since then, Djalo has enjoyed a seven-minute cameo against Santa Clara in the league and a 20-minute run-out against Maritimo in the cup. Pacos de Ferreira are in the relegation zone but it has been a fruitful breakthrough campaign for the teenager.</p>
      <p>Everton and Newcastle could look to strengthen their future options with the signing of Djalo. The Portugal U17 winger is highly-rated and his release clause makes him a gettable option.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>If Djalo fulfils his potential, Everton or Newcastle could have a gem on their hands. He would be an academy player to start with but Djalo would be aiming to break into the first-team in the next few seasons.</p>
      <p>If either club are serious about Djalo, they need to act quickly. Interest in the Portuguese starlet appears to be mounting.</p>
