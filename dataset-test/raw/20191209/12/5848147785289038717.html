      <h1>Minister urges shoppers to boycott ‘un-Australian’ Coles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:21:09+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Drought Minister David Littleproud wants shoppers to boycott Coles because of what he calls the supermarket’s “low act” of failing to pass on a levy for struggling dairy farmers.</p>
      <p>Coles last week agreed to pay dairy cooperative Norco $5.25 million after the consumer watchdog <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/finance/consumer/2019/12/05/coles-dairy-farmers-norco/">accused the company of not fully passing on a 10-cent drought levy</a> on milk to farmers.</p>
      <p>Mr Littleproud called for shoppers to boycott the grocery giant until it put a 20-cent levy on all dairy products.</p>
      <p>“They broke their promise, that’s un-Australian,” he told the ABC’s RN <i>Breakfast</i> on Monday.</p>
      <p>“What I’m saying is they can get back their social licence. They can show that they care about a sustainable dairy industry.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mr Littleproud said the retailer had “shown its true colours” over the levy.</p>
      <p>“They told their customers they were helping farmers, then tried keeping the money,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Coles has shown its true colours and needs to put things right.”</p>
      <p>Mr Littleproud, the former agriculture minister, said he negotiated a deal with Coles to ensure the levy would flow to farmers.</p>
      <p>“Coles should now lead the way and put at least 20 cents a litre right across its dairy range, not just on milk to show they really do care about dairy farmers,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They owe it to dairy farmers and the public for failing to live up to their promises.”</p>

      <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission claims Coles did not raise its payment to Norco, which supplies the chain’s own-branded milk, by the 10 cents a litre it had claimed.</p>
      <p>Coles disagreed with the ACCC’s decision but agreed to the payments in order to avoid “an unnecessary dispute” and help farmers.</p>
      <p>Norco is a milk co-operative with more than 300 farmers in northern NSW and Queensland.</p>
      <p>Mr Littleproud has previously called for a <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/02/19/supermarket-milk-littleproud/">boycott of Coles and “the big German” Aldi</a> over both chains’ cut-price $1 milk.</p>
