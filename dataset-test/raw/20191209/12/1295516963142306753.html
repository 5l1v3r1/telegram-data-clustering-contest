      <p>During the first hour of "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>", The Arrowverse lost the hero whose series started it all when <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-oliver-queen-death/">Green Arrow gave his life</a> to save a great portion of Earth-38's populace. Now, <i>Arrow </i>star Stephen Amell, who has played Oliver Queen since 2012, has a message for fans following this loss.</p>
      <p>"Keep me in your heart," the actor tweeted just minutes after the end of <i>Supergirl</i>.</p>

      <p>According to "Crisis" showrunner Marc Guggenheim, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-arrowverse-showrunners-oliver-queen-death/">Oliver died so early</a> in the crossover so as to both surprise the audience and establish the event's stakes. However, even though Oliver is gone, the heroes of the Arrowverse will continue to do whatever it takes to stop the Anti-Monitor.</p>
