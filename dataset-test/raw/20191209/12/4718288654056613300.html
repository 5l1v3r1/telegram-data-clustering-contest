      <p>VIJAYAWADA: The clamour to get a kilo of onion sold at subsidised rates at Rythu Bazaars claimed the life of a 55-year person in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>With the onion prices touching Rs 180 per kilo in retail market, people have been making a beeline to the Rythu Bazaars where the government is selling onions at a subsidised price of Rs 25 per kilo. An individual is given only one kilo of onion on producing Aadhaar card.</p>
      <p>This, however, is not stopping people to stand in lines from 5 am itself at the Rythu Bazaars across the state. 55-year-old Sambaiah was among the hundreds who stood in queue sine early morning and was waiting for his turn when he reportedly suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed. Locals shifted him to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, people continue to wait for hours together to get a kg of onion in front of Rythu Bazaars across the State. Agitated people are resorting to protests forcing the authorities to sell onions with police protection.</p>
