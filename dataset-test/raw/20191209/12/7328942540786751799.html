      <h3>What is the most dangerous water slide?</h3>
      <p>While the vast majority of water slides in the world are perfectly safe, there are some very notorious ones that have since been closed. One famous example was the Black Hole water ride at the Wet 'n Wild Water Park in Orlando. </p>

      <p>While it did enjoy many years of happy customers, back in 2000 one rider was so badly injured that he sought, and won, a<a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2000/10/02/story4.html"><b> $1.73 million</b> court case</a>. But this was far from the only incident on the slide. </p>
      <p>The ride was plagued with issues like tubes constantly flipping over, people falling off the rise and tubes often hitting other tubes. What's more most of these incidents occurred in one of the ride's darker sections. </p>
      <h3>What is the world's biggest water slide?</h3>
      <p>At over <b>12-stories</b> tall, <a href="https://www.aqualandia.net/en/atraccion/cyclon/">Cyclon</a> is one of the world's biggest water slides. This <b>200 meters</b> long, <b>20-meter diameter</b> slide recently opened in Aqualandia, Benidorm and is already a fond favorite for holidaymakers to the area. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Cyclon is a big attraction with extraordinary dimensions. The attraction counts <b>36 meters</b> high and with <b>200 meters</b> in length. You will find different falls, curves, and descents. You can enjoy a long route of <b>2.7 meters</b> with afloat for 4 persons and you are going to arrive on a large “vortex” with <b>20 meters</b> of diameter and <b>45 degrees</b> inclination.<br/>The adventure in this big “vortex” ends with a fall in the pool." - <a href="https://www.aqualandia.net/en/atraccion/cyclon/">Aqualandia</a>. </p>
      <h3>What is the best inflatable water slide?</h3>
      <p>According to sites like <a href="https://thegearhunt.com/best-inflatable-water-slides-reviewed/">The Gear Hunt</a>, some of the best inflatable water slides around include, but are not limited to: -</p>
      <ol>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.holidayworld.com/">The Mammoth</a> Water Coaster at the Holiday World &amp; Splashin' Safari in Indiana is one of the world's craziest water slides. This six-person water coaster covers no less than three acres of the safari park and runs for just under a<b> third of a mile (0.5 km).</b> </p>
      <p>The slide is powered by linear induction motors (LIMS). These motors are also used in traditional roller coasters and light rail transportation. </p>
      <p>It is because of these motors that the Mammoth water slide is so fast and can accommodate steep uphill and downhill sections. The water coaster is also a record-breaker, holding the record for the <a href="https://www.holidayworld.com/holiblog/2016/05/27/guinness-world-records-certifies-mammoth/">World's Longest Water Coaster</a>.</p>
      <h4>2. Shark Attack, Aquadventure Waterpark, Dubai</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The Shark Attack in <a href="https://www.atlantis.com/dubai/atlantis-aquaventure/aquaventure-waterpark/slides-rides">Aquadventure Waterpark</a>, Dubai is yet another of the world's craziest water slides. This amazing water slide's main feature is that riders travel underwater sailing through an aquarium teeming with sharks. </p>
      <p>For full effect, the tube is completely transparent bringing riders up close and personal, but safely, into the realm of the shark. While this may conjure up images of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU1drUvqjmAhV9A2MBHUTxAYUQMwhzKBowGg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Da4Td_W5dc1w&amp;psig=AOvVaw3OFLHGKdmjDaY5RW5jC5mb&amp;ust=1575978261672765&amp;ictx=3&amp;uact=3">Jaws 3-D</a>, rest assured the ride is completely safe.</p>
      <p>Plus there are no giant homicidal Great White sharks to worry about. At least as far as we are aware!</p>
      <h4>3. El Abismo, Ixtapan Parque Acuatico, Mexico</h4>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLZE8kbwQ0E" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Featuring an almost vertical loop-the-loop section, the <a href="http://ixtapan.com/index.html">El Abismo</a> in Mexico is another of the world's craziest water slides. RIders of the water slide start the ride by standing on a trapdoor. </p>
      <p>The ride can be found<b> 90 minutes</b> southwest of Mexico City. </p>
      <p>Once they are first dropped, riders reach <b>60 kilometers per hour</b> just prior to reaching the ride's crazy loop. The loop is also transparent adding to the thrill of the ride.</p>
      <p>"With the unique slide path, we had to optimize the shape of the loop to maximize the range of riders that could use it while making sure no one got stuck," says Bruce Bradley, senior engineering specialist at <a href="https://www.whitewaterwest.com/">WhiteWater West theme park designers</a>.</p>
      <h4>4. Tsunami Surge, Hurricane Harbor, Six Flags Over Georgia, Atlanta</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The Tsunami Surge water slide at <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/overgeorgia/hurricane-harbor/overview">Hurricane Harbor, Six Flags Over Georgia, Atlanta</a> is yet another of the world's craziest water slides. It is the world's first hybrid zero-gravity slide that features a five-story drop that transports riders into a whirlpool bowl that spins them <b>360-degrees</b>. </p>
      <p>"[Get] ready to be sent down an enclosed tube into a <b>40-foot-wide</b> bowl, where guests will feel a moment of zero-gravity, or weightlessness, before hitting an embankment and landing in the splash pool below. Throughout the whole water ride, you'll be screaming around every slippery turn." - <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/overgeorgia/hurricane-harbor/tsunami-surge">Six Flags Over Georgia</a>. </p>
      <p>The ride consumes around <b>300,000 gallons</b> of water every hour. </p>
      <h4>5. Kilimanjaro, Aldeia das Águas Park Resort, Brazil</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Kilimanjaro, <a href="https://www.aldeiadasaguasresort.com.br/o-parque/">Aldeia das Águas Park Resort</a>, Brazil is one hell of a water ride. Named in honor of the famous Tanzanian mountain, this 49.9-meter tall water ride offers riders a <b>164-foot (50 meters)</b> drop. </p>
      <p>It is officially the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-water-slide/">world's tallest water slide</a> and riders quickly reach an incredible <b>100 km/h</b> as they hurtle down the water slide. If you want to try it for yourself, it can be found at the Aldeia das Águas Park Resort, which is located around about <b>120 kilometers</b> from the city of Rio de Janeiro.</p>

      <p>The King Cobra at the <a href="https://www.maxxroyal.com/en/">Maxx Royal Belek Golf and Spa</a> in Turkey is yet another of the world's craziest water slides. Riders travel along the slide at an incredible<b> 51 km/h</b> and are treated to a tour of a giant cobra's body before sliding up into its mouth. </p>
      <p>Many in the industry consider the slide something of a game-changer. </p>
      <p>"It's a high-capacity ride with two double tubes, and it's interactive because the passengers race each other... It has a strong visual impact and a unique spectator appeal, with integrated special effects, such as hissing sounds," says Sohret Pakis of <a href="http://www.polin.com.tr/">Polin Waterparks &amp; Pool Systems</a>.</p>
      <h4>7. Boeing 747, Evergreen Wings and Waves Waterpark, Oregon</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The Boeing 747 at <a href="https://wingsandwaveswaterpark.com/">Evergreen Wings and Waves Waterpark</a> in Oregon is probably one of the most unique water slides in the world. As the name suggests, the ride actually features a real decommissioned Boeing 747 with four waterslides coming out of it. </p>
      <p>Riders get to choose which water slide adventure they want to take including their <a href="https://wingsandwaveswaterpark.com/attraction/sonic-boom/">Sonic Boom slide</a>. This slide lets riders experience the feeling of being catapulted out of the plane's fuselage.</p>
