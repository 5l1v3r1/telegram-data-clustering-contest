      <p>Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has died at the age of 101, Concise News understands, according to NHK television.</p>
      <p>Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987, boosted Japan’s global profile.</p>
      <p>Nakasone pursued domestic reforms aggressively, privatizing Japan’s state-run railway, tobacco and telecommunications monopolies. Critics say, however, that he failed to implement a landmark set of reform proposals to help Japan’s economy grow.</p>
      <p>He won a rare fifth year in office after leading his Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory in 1986 elections. But his career was shadowed by links to a huge political scandal, a stocks-for-favors scam.</p>
      <p>Born in the hilly district of Takasaki, northwest of Tokyo, on May 27, 1918, to a wealthy timber trader, Nakasone graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University, later the Tokyo University, before entering the Home Ministry in 1941.</p>
      <p>He joined the Tokyo Police Department after Japan’s surrender in 1945. Nakasone has two daughters and a politician son, Hirofumi.</p>
