      <h1>Ariana Grande celebrates Thanksgiving with both of her parents for the first time in 18 years</h1>
      <h2>The singer was previously estranged from her father</h2>

      <p>Ariana Grande has revealed that she spent Thanksgiving with both of her parents for the first time in 18 years.</p>
      <p>The singer’s dad Edward Butera split from her mother Joan Grande when she was just eight-year-old, and the singer has been vocal about their strained relationship in the past.</p>
      <p>But Ariana reconnected with her father last year, and it looks like Edward and Joan have since settled their differences as they happily posed for photos together on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Sharing a selfie with her mom and dad on her Instagram Story, Ariana wrote, “First Thanksgiving with both of my parents in 18 years!”</p>

      <p>Back in 2014, the songstress admitted to falling out with her father, and said it was “one of the hardest things” she’s ever dealt with.</p>
      <p>She told Seventeen magazine, “It’s private … it took me so long to be okay with it. The thing that got me there was embracing the fact that that I am made up of half my dad, and a lot of my traits come from him.”</p>
      <p>“So much of me comes from my father, and for so long, I didn’t like that about myself. I had to accept that it’s okay not to get along with somebody and still love them,” she added.</p>

      <p>But then last December, <a href="http://goss.ie/la-showbiz/ariana-grande-connects-with-her-estranged-father-edward-butera-over-christmas-161262">Ariana confirmed that she had reconciled with her dad</a>, as she shared a photo of them FaceTimeing on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Ariana shared the photo just weeks after she referenced her parents divorce in her hit single, ‘Thank U, Next’.</p>
      <p>Lyrics in the song include: “One day I’ll walk down the aisle/ holding hands with my mama/ I’ll be thanking my dad ’cause she grew from the drama.”</p>
