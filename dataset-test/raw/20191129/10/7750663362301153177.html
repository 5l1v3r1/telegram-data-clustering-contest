      <h1>Neil Lennon hails "landmark night" as Celtic top group</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neil-lennon/"><b>Neil Lennon</b></a> praised his <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/celtic/"><b>Celtic</b></a> players for a "landmark" victory after their 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/rennes/"><b>Rennes</b></a> at Parkhead clinched top spot in their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/europa-league/"><b>Europa League</b></a> section for the first time.</h2>

      <p>The Hoops had already qualified for the last 32 of the competition before the game but their boss had stressed the importance of winning Group E to ensure the possibility of a more favourable draw.</p>
      <p>Makeshift centre forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-morgan/"><b>Lewis Morgan</b></a>, in for the absent <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/odsonne-edouard/"><b>Odsonne Edouard</b></a>, fired the home side ahead in the 22nd minute with attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-christie/"><b>Ryan Christie</b></a> doubling that lead just before the interval.</p>
      <p>Second-half substitute <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikey-johnston/"><b>Mikey Johnston</b></a> added a third before Rennes substitute <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adrien-hunou/"><b>Adrien Hunou</b></a> headed in a late consolation for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Lennon's side moved on to 13 points – the first time they have broken the 10-point barrier – and with Cluj losing 1-0 to Lazio in Rome, top spot is guaranteed for the Hoops before they travel to Romania next month.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how big an achievement it is but it is a landmark night, we have never done it before either in Europa League or Champions League," said Lennon, who confirmed Edouard missed out with a "niggle" and will be assessed before the trip to Ross County on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"That is fantastic and what it means is we can possibly get a better draw for the last 32.</p>
      <p>"They had some milestones to achieve tonight. Could they go beyond 10 points, could they win the group, could they win 10 games in Europe and they answered all that.</p>
      <p>"Psychologically it wasn't an easy game because of circumstances but they handled it well.</p>
      <p>"Going forward we are playing very well and our goalkeeper had made a double save that was world class.</p>
      <p>"We could have won the game by more and I am absolutely delighted for the players.</p>
      <p>"They keep setting themselves new milestones and they are a fantastic bunch and playing very well at the moment."</p>
      <p>Celtic are unbeaten after winning four and drawing one of their five group matches.</p>
      <p>"What pleases me is the 100 per cent record at home and we are unbeaten away," added the Northern Irishman.</p>
      <p>"We won all our games at home and that pleased me. It was important to keep momentum going and we played with freedom and real swagger.</p>
      <p>"There was no complacency apart from the last 15 minutes which is totally understandable."</p>
