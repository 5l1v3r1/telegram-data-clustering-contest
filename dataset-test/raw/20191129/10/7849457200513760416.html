      <p>This was revealed on Friday by neophyte Senator Christopher Lawrence ‘’Bong’’ Go, chairman of the Senate sports committee, following consultations with Phisgoc Chairman and Speaker Alan Peter S. Cayetano ahead of the formal opening of 2019 30<sup>th</sup> Southeast Asian (SEA) Games Saturday.</p>
      <p>“The rationale for this move is to encourage more local support and attract a bigger local crowd to watch the games,” Go said.</p>
      <p>Go said that he had suggested to Cayetano to make tickets for SEA Games activities accessible to the public for free, in all government-owned venues, subject to their availability.</p>
      <p>He quoted Phisgoc officials as saying that this could not be done in private venues like the SM Mall of Asia (MOA).</p>
      <p>    <br/>He said tickets for basketball, football and volleyball were almost sold out.</p>
      <p>“Tickets for the Closing Ceremony of the 30th SEA Games to be held at the New Clark City Athletics Stadium on December 11, which have not yet been opened for sale to date, may also be issued to the public, free of charge and subject to availability,’’ Go pointed out.</p>
      <p>Go said the President was pushing to make the tickets free, saying “If allowed… alam nyo kilala ko si Pangulo gusto n’ya libre. If it is possible…I know the President and he wants it free for the public).’’ (I know the President wanting the public to see these games for free.)  </p>
      <p>Go, former aide of the President when he was the Davao city mayor, recalled that during such events in Davao City, like sportsfests and other athletic competitions, then Mayor Duterte would always wanted that such activities be made accessible to the public for free.</p>
      <p>‘’We are encouraging all Filipinos to unite and watch the Games as a support to our athletes,” he said.</p>
      <p>The 2019 SEA Games, which will officially starts Saturday at the Philippine Arena in Bulacan, will be the fourth time that the country will host them. The last time the Philippines hosted the Games was in 2005.</p>
      <p>Go also said it will be the perfect time to showcase how Filipinos can unite as one for their love for sports and to show the famous Filipino brand of hospitality to the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>“Let’s work as one in order for us to win as one,” Go said.</p>
