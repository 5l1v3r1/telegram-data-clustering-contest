      <p>Neymar has endured endured a torrid time off the field since his €222 million (R3.6 billion) move from FC Barcelona to PSG in 2017, with the Brazil star marred by injury and plastered across newspapers for a spate of controversies. </p>
      <p>Throughout this period, which has seen the 27-year-old publicly court a return to Barca and assault a rival fan, Neymar has been widely criticised by supporters and former professionals alike for his attitude. </p>
      <p>Emmanuel Petit is the latest ex-pro to lay into Neymar, with the former France international launching a scathing attack on the Santos academy graduate's character. </p>

      <p>"This guy plays for him, and only for him," Petit told <i>RMC Sport</i>, as reported by <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"Put yourself in the place of the boys in the dressing room of the PSG, who live for months on the whims of this guy who s**t on the club and his teammates, who does not have any respect."</p>
      <p>Petit also shared his view that Neymar's on-field contributions are also not enough to afford him special treatment. </p>
      <p>"When I played with (Zinedine) Zidane or (Youri) Djorkaeff, I knew they were able to dictate a game alone, so we accepted their defensive neglect," he added.</p>
      <p>"We accepted them and did the job because we knew he could win with a flash of his genius. This is not the case, at all, of Neymar."</p>
