      <p>Notorious armed robbers landed behind bars after investigating detectives closed in on them.</p>
      <p>The robbers started living a lavish lifestyle overnight and recklessly spending money in public places.</p>
      <p>CCTV pictures sold out <a href="https://iharare.com/robbers-caught-red-handed-on-camera/">notorious armed robbers who recently broke into a Mutare GTel shop</a> and stole high-end cellphones valued at more than $70 000 in a movie-style smash-and-grab 90-second robbery.</p>
      <p>Detectives in Harare who were doing their daily surveillance duties last Friday in Hopley Farm got suspicious of the way the one of the suspects was spending cash at a drinking spot.</p>
      <p>The arrested him intending to question him on the source of his income  and after interrogation he sold out his other gang members and explained to the cops how they executed the break-ins.</p>
      <p>Officer Commanding Manicaland Police Commissioner Dr Wiklef Makamache <a href="https://www.manicapost.co.zw/pictures-sell-out-armed-robbers/">confirmed the arrest of three of the gang members.</a></p>
      <aside>“This case is still under investigation and we are not at liberty to make public the identities of the arrested criminals at this juncture because this might compromise our work,” he said.</aside>
      <p>Comm Makamache, however, said one of the robbers was arrested after he took some of the stolen cellphones to a dealer in Harare with the intention of flushing out their systems in a bid to avoid detection.</p>
      <aside>“After the robbery police in Mutare relayed a message to all stations in the country about the heist. Our counterparts in Harare received the message and they spread it to various workstations in the capital city. Cellphone dealers were also told of the robbery and the nature of the stolen items.<br/>“So when this suspect visited the alert dealer with the intention of flushing out the cellphones, the dealer quickly tipped off the police and an arrest was made.”</aside>
      <p>Comm Makamache said investigations done to date show that the arrested three suspects and the fugitive two accomplices all live in Harare and they only travelled to Mutare on November 7 to commit the GTel robbery.</p>
      <aside>“These criminals have a full knowledge of the City of Mutare. They come during the day and do their investigations and surveillance, spotting the best shop to hit. They did their homework well. At night they pounced on the shop and raced back to the capital city to sell their loot.</aside>
      <p>The GTel robbery was done under a minute and 28 seconds.</p>
