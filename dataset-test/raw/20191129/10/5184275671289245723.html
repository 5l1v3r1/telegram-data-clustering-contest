      <p>Tusshar was quoted saying, “It is like a labour of love for sure. I have been involved with this film for many many years now. I bought the rights in 2013, so you can call it a passion project.”</p>
      <p>He further added, “<i>Laxmmi Bomb</i>’ is my first film as a producer and I have got an amazing team. Akshay sir is the main protagonist and it is like a dream come true for any producer to start his production career with an actor of his stature. I don’t have words to talk about ‘<i>Laxmmi Bomb</i>’, <i>‘Kanchana’</i> has always been my favorite subject. I am expressionless, cannot really contain my excitement in words.”</p>
      <p>Tusshar also shared an update about the film that Akshay Kumar is currently working on. He said, “The film is currently in the final stages of filming, the last schedule is just going to happen now. We are also busy with the post-production of the film.”</p>
      <p>Well, the film’s release is an exciting affair for not one but two reasons. Firstly we will get to see Akshay Kumar in a new avatar and secondly because the film will be clashing with Salman Khan’s much-awaited film – <i>Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai</i>. Tusshar Kapoor chose not to speak about the clash and quipped, “Maybe closer to the release I will able to answer this better.”</p>
      <p><i>Laxmmi Bomb</i> is a remake of hit Tamil film <i>‘Kanchana’,</i> The first look of Akshay Kumar’s character was released a few months back which garnered a lot of attention and love from the audience.</p>
