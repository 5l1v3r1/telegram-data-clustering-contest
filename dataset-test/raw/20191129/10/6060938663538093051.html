      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:57:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>We all know of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arjun-Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a> and Ranveer Singh’s close friendship. The two best buds always know how to pack on the ‘Bromance’ every time they come together on or off the big screen. Speaking about the same, Arjun, in a recent interaction, revealed how he keeps telling <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepika-Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a> that he is her "<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/souten">souten</a>".</p>
      <p>While stating that Ranveer still gatecrashes his dubbing sessions and sends him love after watching work, he said that he often tells Deepika “I am her souten.”</p>
      <p>On the work front, Arjun is all set for the release of his movie ‘Panipat’, a historical drama based on the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Third-Battle-of-Panipat">Third Battle of Panipat</a> (1761). The battle was fought between the Marathas, led by the great warrior Sadashivrao Bhau, and Afghan invader Ahmad Shah Abdali. In the film, Arjun plays <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sadashivrao-Bhau">Sadashivrao Bhau</a> while <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a> is Abdali.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on Thursday, Nawabzada Shadab Ali Bahadur, an eighth-generation descendant of Peshwa Baji Rao who lives in Bhopal, served legal notices to the makers of ‘Panipat’ over a certain dialogue that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Sanon">Kriti Sanon</a>, who plays Parvati Bai, delivers in the film.</p>
      <p>The problematic dialogue goes: "Maine suna hai Peshwa jab akele muhim par jaate hain to ek Mastani ke saath laut te hain (I've heard that whenever the Peshwa goes to the war alone, he returns with a Mastani)."</p>
      <p>‘Panipat’ directed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashutosh-Gowariker">Ashutosh Gowariker</a> hits theatres on December 6.</p>
