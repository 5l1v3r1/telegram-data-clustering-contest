      <p>LAHORE, PAKISTAN -- An international trade association says a Pakistani female journalist was shot and killed by her husband earlier this week in the eastern city of Lahore after he demanded she quit her job.</p>
      <p>In Friday's statement, the International Federation of Journalists urged Pakistan to conduct a probe into Monday's murder of Urooj Iqbal who was a reporter at a local newspaper.</p>
      <p>It says Iqbal was killed by Dilawar Ali on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.</p>
      <p>Iqbal's family says she had alerted police her husband was harassing her, but no action was taken. Police have arrested Ali and charged him with murder.</p>
      <p>Pakistani women often face harassment at the workplace, but many offenders escape punishment as victims don't report such incidents to avoid further social stigma.</p>
