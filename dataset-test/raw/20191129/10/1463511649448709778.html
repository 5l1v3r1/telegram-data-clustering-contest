      <p>Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi, has been named as the Absa Premiership Player of the Month for September/October.</p>
      <p>Kaizer Chiefs during this period won an impressive four games with one defeat registering 12 points from a possible 15 as they extended their lead at the top of the standings to 10 points.</p>
      <p>Akpeyi was delighted with his award, admitting that it came as a surprise to be named as the Player of the Month.</p>
      <p>“This comes as a big surprise to me but it also shows the importance of putting effort forward in whatever you do,” Akpeyi said. “I give credit to the technical team who have been patient with me.</p>
      <p>“I’m settling in, I’m taking each game as it comes. Khune is a good keeper, I’m just grateful for the opportunity from the coach. It’s healthy competition in that department. I’m just happy to be improving all the time.”</p>
      <p>Chiefs next host Bloemfontein Celtic in an Absa Premiership clash on December 7 and will be aiming to extend their impressive run that has seen Middendorp’s side winning their last seven games.</p>
