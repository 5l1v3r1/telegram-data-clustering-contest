      <p>Qatar aim to put behind them their disappointing opening match loss against Iraq and come back strongly against Yemen, said striker Akram Afif (pictured).</p>
      <p>Afif said his team-mates are fully aware of the task which lies ahead of them and the responsibilities which come along with it.</p>
      <p>“The outcome of the Iraq match was disappointing and this is something we must forget. We are determined to return back to winning ways. We know the difficult task which lies ahead for us and also we are aware of the size of the responsibility.”</p>
      <p>Afif said they were targeting full points and it does not matter how the goals came.</p>
      <p>“We will play according to the plan and it does not matter how we score. We are thinking of winning and achieving the three points.”</p>
      <p>Afif shot down the suggestion that his team-mates were tense during the opening match against Iraq.</p>
      <p>“No, that is not true. We did not appear tense. We played the game calmly and what happened was that we did not take advantage of the opportunities,” he added.</p>
