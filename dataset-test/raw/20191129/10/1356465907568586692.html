      <p><a href="https://cake.hr/">CakeHR</a>, the London-based provider of cloud HR solutions, has been acquired by <a href="https://www.sage.com/en-gb/">Sage Group</a>, a legacy business software company in the UK that is transitioning to SaaS.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2012, CakeHR allows companies, particularly small businesses, move key areas of HR management to the cloud. For the 27,000 users around the world, the SaaS suite helps them comply with all local legislation, as well. These users can now access Sage services, including payroll solutions, via open API. Sage will offer CakeHR services to its UK customers starting in 2020.</p>
      <p>Terms were not disclosed, but CakeHR’s team will join Sage upon close of the deal.</p>
      <p>Kaspars Upmanis, CEO of CakeHR said: “By combining our experience and expertise with Sage, CakeHR will be able to further its vision of providing an easy-to-use, powerful, and always-accessible HR platform to any organization. HR deserves better. HR must be simplified. Joining the ranks of Sage has brought us closer to that goal than ever before.”</p>
      <p>Lee Perkins, Chief Product Officer at Sage, said: “Building and acquiring great technology to help accountants and businesses focus on what matters most is a critical part of Sage becoming a great SaaS company. CakeHR provides easy-to-use cloud-based HR services that help businesses drive productivity and provide great experiences for their people. As with our recent acquisition of AutoEntry, we have been hugely impressed with the people and technology at CakeHR, particularly their ability to enable employees to self-manage, and are delighted to welcome them to Sage.”</p>
