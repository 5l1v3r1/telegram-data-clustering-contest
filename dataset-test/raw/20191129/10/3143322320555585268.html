      <h1>Dagga laws in SA: some oils are more legal than others</h1>
      <h2>Clicklaw explains why you may now trade in CBD oil and which limits apply.</h2>

      <p>CBD oil has been increasing in popularity and many sellers and distributors are openly dealing in this cannabis-derived substance.</p>
      <p>This is legal despite the 2019 Constitutional Court decision that legalised the private production and use of dagga, but failed to decriminalise dealing in cannabis.</p>
      <p>Today, Clicklaw explains why there is an exception to this rule. Cannabidiol (CBD) by itself does not make one high. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), on the other hand, does. This video explains more:</p>

      <p>Until May next year, you will be able to freely buy and sell mixtures that contain no THC, but only CBD. If you divide the stock you have by the number of days, your maximum daily dose will be 20 mg CBD. The minister also stipulated that the CBD should not be advertised as a cure for any specific disease. It can claim enhancing health in general.</p>
      <p>The minister made another rule: If someone sells a product made from cannabis raw plant material, it may contain no more cannabinoids than the source product does in nature.</p>
      <p>More specifically, the raw plant material may not more than 0,001 % of (THC) and not more than 0,0075 % (CBD).</p>
      <p>The gazetted notice will lapse in May next year. Once that happens, CBD will be a schedule 4 medication, which means that you will need to get a prescription before buying it and that only pharmacists will be allowed to sell it to you.</p>
