      <h3>‘UNANG Hirit’ is celebrating its 20th anniversary and they will treat the viewers to a super fun special anniversary week starting this Monday. Main anchor Igan Arnold Clavio says that when the show was first offered to him, he was asked: “Kaya mo ba gumising sa madaling araw?”</h3>
      <p>“Pero sanay na akong magising nang maaga as a news writer and I felt it’s an opportunity I shouldn’t let go,” he says. “I have no inkling na aabutin pala kami ng 20 years. Yung mga kasama ko rito, naging ninong ako sa kasal nila, naging ninong ako ng mga anak nila. We’re really a barkada, a family, and we learn a lot from each other sa ganda ng samahan namin dito. I’m proud and happy to be part of this show. Akong nagbubukas ng GMA sa umaga at sa gabi, isa rin ako sa nagsasara with our late newscast ‘Saksi’, then I do radio work pa sa DZBB so sanay na rin akong kulang sa tulog.”</p>
      <p>Since 1999, Unang Hirit (UH) continues to be the Filipinos’ companion as they jumpstart their day. They turn to UH for the latest weather updates, breaking news, and other special features to keep them informed and entertained. Over the years, the UH barkada has grown. Pioneer hosts Arnold Clavio, Suzi Entrata-Abrera, and Lhar Santiago are joined by Lyn Ching, Love Añover-Llanko, Susan Enriquez, Connie Sison, Ivan Mayrina, Mariz Umali, and Luane Dy.  The program also has its team of experts, Nathaniel “Mang Tani” Cruz, Atty. Gaby Concepcion, and Mareng Winnie Monsod. Now the group is made extra colorful with the presence of regular UH katambays Boobay, Juancho Triviño and Joyce Pring, and also recently, with Mga Batang UH Yuan Francisco, Angelica Ulip, and Leanne Bautista.</p>
      <p>Coinciding with the show’s anniversary is the contract renewal of its hosts last November 26 attended by GMA Network Chairman and CEO Atty. Felipe L. Gozon, President and COO Gilberto R. Duavit, Jr., Senior Vice President for News and Public Affairs Marissa L. Flores, and First Vice President for Public Affairs Nessa Valdellon. Vice President for Corporate Affairs and Communications Angel Javier Cruz, Senior AVP for Public Affairs Arlene Carnay, and Program Managers Queenie Dimapawi and Mon Torres were also present.</p>
      <p>This week until Dec 6, loyal followers will be treated with special episodes and surprises with former hosts visiting to join in the fun. The show will be giving away special prizes such as home appliances, furniture, negosyo packages, and gadgets. One lucky loyal viewer will even have a chance to win a brand-new house and lot!  This is their way of saying thanks for all the support and loyalty through the years.</p>
      <p>Unang Hirit prides itself for having bagged the Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA) “Best Live Special Event Coverage Award” for “Unang Hirit sa Vatican and Italy” and “Live sa Holy Land” hosted by Susan Enriquez and Rhea Santos, respectively. A back-to-back win for two consecutive years. Keep having great mornings with the Unang Hirit barkada, Monday to Friday, 4:55 a.m. on GMA 7.</p>
