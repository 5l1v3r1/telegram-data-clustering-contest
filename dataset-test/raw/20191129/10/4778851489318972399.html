        <b>Celtic defeated Rennes 3-1 last night to top Group E and advance to the last 32 in the Europa League last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neil Lennon's side are now unbeaten in five Europa League games and top the group with a game still left to play, meaning Celtic will avoid the Champions League dropouts in the next round.</p>
      <p>Ex-St Mirren and Sunderland loanee Lewis Morgan's second Celtic goal and a Ryan Christie strike catapulted the hosts into a commanding half-time lead before Mikey Johnston added to the tally with a superb one-two finish.</p>
      <p>Adrien Hunou's glancing header provided a late consolation for the French side but that did nothing to dampen Celtic fans' spirits, with scores of fans taking to Twitter to express their delight at their team.</p>
      <p><b>@Dec92316</b>: "When was the last time 3 Scottish players scored for Celtic in a European game?"</p>
      <p><b>@carol2244m:</b> "Best team in Scotland by far."</p>
      <p><b>@14__morrow:</b> "We are Glasgow Celtic and we won’t be stopped."</p>
      <p><b>@hughie3266:</b> "Absolutely fantastic now sort things out with the GB so we can get back to being 1 big happy Celtic family."</p>
      <p><b>@Andygall1:</b> "Is this not one of Celtic's best performances in the Europa league if not the best?"</p>
      <p><b>@dpdjp90:</b> "Fantastic. Congratulations to Neil and the players. Exemplary season so far. Trophy number 1 incoming..."</p>
      <p><b>@buff_egan:</b> "Best Celtic team in Europe. Since the times of Larrson."</p>
      <p><b>@hctelfih:</b> "We’re actually winning the entire competition."</p>
      <p><b>@67shadesofgreen:</b> "Delighted for Lewis Morgan!"</p>

      <p><b>@ChrisStewartCS:</b> "Never thought I’d see the day a Celtic team could take their foot off the gas in Europe so they could stay fresh for Ross County. What a time to be alive!"</p>
      <p><b>@StateAidLoon:</b> "Delighted for Morgan, the boy put a shift in the night."</p>
