      <h1>Get Yourself a Robotic Slave/Housekeeper With This £240 Roomba Discount</h1>

      <p>Nobody likes vacuuming, which is why we developed robots to help that burden. Sure they're not as efficient as doing it ourselves with a proper vacuum, but in our increasingly busy society most of us are two busy woking three jobs to afford the rent on our London broom cupboards.</p>
      <p>Sadly not everyone can afford a Roomba, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0815HXNWM">but with £240 off</a> they became a little bit more affordable for the masses.</p>
      <p>This is the iRobot Roomba 960 Robot Vacuum Cleaner, which has Wi-Fi, app control, and comes bundled with an Echo Dot you can use to send commands to it with your voice. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0815HXNWM">It was £690, but now it's £450</a>, which is pretty nice. Still expensive, but if you were on the fence about picking one of these up then this might be the push you needed.</p>
      <p>Just as long as you don't have pets. Contrary to what funny internet clips might have you believe, cats and dogs do not like the Roomba.</p>
