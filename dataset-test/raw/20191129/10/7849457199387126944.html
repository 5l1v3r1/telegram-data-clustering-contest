      <p><b>BACOLOD CITY</b> – A five-year-old boy died in a fire that razed four houses at Purok Sigay, Brgy. 2 on Thursday, Nov. 28.</p>
      <p>The recent fire came two days after the biggest fire that hit Bacolod with six casualties at Java pension house last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Publio Ploteña, city fire marshal, identified the fatality as Raniel Macapal.</p>
      <p>Ploteña said the blaze started from the house of Belinda Cuadra at around 5:32 a.m., where the victim and an infant were staying.</p>
      <p>Ploteña said an occupant at Cuadra’s house rescued Macapal and an infant inside the burning house. However, she was separated from Macapal when she failed to strongly hold his hand.</p>
      <p>The victim was left inside the burning house.</p>
      <p>Ploteña said they have yet to establish the identity of the occupant who was at Cuadra’s house when the fire happened.</p>
      <p>Cuadra’s house was destroyed while three other neighboring houses owned by Silvia Sugilon, Bernardo Galicia, and Jose Bonza Sr., were also damaged. All houses were made of light materials.</p>
      <p>The BFP declared fire out at around 6:10 a.m. The estimated cost of damage was pegged at P30,000.</p>
      <p>Arson investigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire.</p>
