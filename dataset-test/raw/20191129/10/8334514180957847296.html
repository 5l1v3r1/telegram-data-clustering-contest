      <p>BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation accelerated faster than expected in November on a rise in food and services prices, likely comforting European Central Bank policymakers even if some factors pushing up prices may be only temporary.</p>

      <p>The ECB has struggled for years to boost inflation, which has undershot its target of almost 2% despite unprecedented stimulus that included negative interest rates, 2.6 trillion euros worth of bond purchases and subsidized loans to banks.</p>
      <p>Annual inflation jumped to 1% this month from 0.7% in October, outpacing expectations for 0.9%, as volatile food prices rose more than predicted, data from Eurostat showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>More comforting for ECB policymakers, underlying inflation also rose faster than predicted as services inflation continued to accelerate since bottoming out in July, possibly due to a normalization in the price of package holidays in Germany.</p>
      <p>Core inflation excluding food and energy prices picked up to 1.5% from 1.2% a month earlier, beating expectations for 1.3%. An even narrower gauge, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, accelerated to 1.3% from 1.1%, ahead of forecasts for 1.2%.</p>
      <p>The November rise is unlikely to signal a bigger shift in price trends, however, and the ECB expects inflation to accelerate only very slowly, undershooting its target for years to come.</p>
      <p>Indeed, headline inflation is only expected to average 1% next year, then rise to 1.5% in 2021 as overall growth remains below what is considered the bloc’s potential, keeping price pressures muted.</p>
      <p>In another comforting sign for policymakers, unemployment fell to 7.5% of the workforce in October, the lowest rate since July 2008, as the number of people without jobs fell by 31,000 to 12.334 million.</p>
      <p>Although employment growth has slowed amid the bloc’s wobble, firms are maintaining their workforces, supporting expectations that the slowdown would not morph into a recession and a recovery would eventually materialize.</p>
      <p>The ECB will next meet on Dec. 12 and its policy stance is not expected to change for months to come.</p>
