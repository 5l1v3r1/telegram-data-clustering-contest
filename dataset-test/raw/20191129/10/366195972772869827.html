      <p>It's been a hell of a day for new music, with releases from Griselda, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/thegame/profile">The Game</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Fabolous/profile">Fabolous</a>, and many more. And that's only the tip of the iceberg, with plenty of new singles sliding through to pad the stats. One such drop comes courtesy of fan-favorite <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/KidInk/profile">Kid Ink</a>, who recently vowed an onslaught of new music on deck. Following <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kid-ink-details-his-vacation-on-his-single-miami-new-song.1984489.html">singles like "Miami,"</a> Ink has once again delivered a warm-up track before his upcoming project, the mellow yet uptempo "Slide Up."</p>
      <p>Strictly on his RnB tip, Ink aims this one directly at the ladies of the crowd, imploring those into yoga to apply their expertise in a practical setting; given he's based out of Los Angeles, it's likely the yoga crowd is bountiful at any given time. Flow-wise, Ink switches up the cadence, lowering it for the sensuality and raising it for the more mischevious lines. It's a specific vibe to be sure, but a vibe nonetheless. Check it out now, and keep your eye out for that new Kid Ink project set to arrive in the near future.</p>

          <b>Quotable Lyrics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Been doing yoga, baby nowâ€…you gotta prove it<br/>Just let your back bend, show me how you do it<br/>You got that drip, girl I'm swimming in your fluid<br/>You hear that slap and I ain't talking 'bout the music</p>
