      <h1>This is the Black Friday UK deal for Surface audio fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:23:08+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/author/Rich%20Edmonds" target="_blank">Rich Edmonds</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft's Surface Headphones are as premium as the tablet range they share the name with. Audio quality is also way up there with the likes of Sony and Bose. And because it's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, you'll be able to save considerably on a new pair directly from Microsoft.</p>

      <p>The Surface Headphones supply outstanding sound quality and can be hooked up to your smartphone or PC. Better still, because it's part of the same line-up, these cups will look great next to your Surface PC.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-headphone-review">Surface Headphones</a> aren't only good in the audio department either. Both cups are capacitive, allowing you to short tap to play/pause music, double tap to skip track or answer a call, triple tap to go to the previous tack, and long press to activate Cortana or decline an incoming call.</p>
