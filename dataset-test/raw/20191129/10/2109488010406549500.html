      <h1>Huawei tipped for fresh US legal fight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:13:50+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#chrisdonkin" target="_blank">Chris Donkin</a></address>
      <p>Huawei began preparations for a legal challenge against a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision to bar operators using government subsidies to purchase its equipment, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The company is expected to begin its formal challenge to the FCC order next week, the newspaper’s sources claim.</p>
      <p>A challenge would come as no surprise given the <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/huawei-slams-fcc-equipment-ban/">company’s damning comments</a> in the aftermath of the FCC’s decision to ban companies from using a $8.5 billion pot of funds to purchase kit from companies deemed a national security risk.</p>
      <p>The prohibition would apply to companies claiming money from the Universal Service Fund, a fund to to aid network deployments for unconnected communities. It is one of a number of measures <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/us-presses-on-with-tech-import-restriction-plan/">targeting China’s major vendors</a>, with Huawei the most prominent.</p>
      <p>Although not widely deployed in the country, equipment from Huawei and domestic rival ZTE is present in a number of networks run by smaller operators.</p>
      <p>In addition to banning the purchase of equipment from certain vendors, the FCC is also proposing rules which would force operators to strip-out network equipment already in use.</p>
