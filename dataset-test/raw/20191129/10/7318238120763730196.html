      <h1>Hong Kong police seize roughly 4,000 petrol bombs on university campus</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong police said they had seized roughly 4,000 petrol bombs from the Polytechnic University campus which has been the battleground of recent protests.</p>
      <p>Police seized petrol bombs, chemicals and offensive weapons, they said, adding that they removed dangerous materials and evidence on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>The campus has now been handed back to university management after being searched by police.</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson criticised protesters for "taking hostage of the university and using it as a weapon factory".</p>
      <p>The spokesman, speaking at a press conference on Friday (Nov 29) added that the case was "alarming" as "dangerous items and explosives [were] in the hands of young students".</p>
      <p>The university was the scene of <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/17/hong-kong-protesters-use-arrows-catapults-and-petrol-bombs-against-police">violent protests</a> on November 17.</p>
      <p>Protesters had used petrol bombs, bows and arrows and catapults against police, but police later laid siege to the university, trapping protesters inside.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/24/hong-kong-elections-four-keys-to-understanding-district-council-polls">Recent elections</a> in Hong Kong resulted in a surge in pro-democracy candidates who secured almost 90% of district council seats.</p>
      <p>Protests in Hong Kong started in June over proposed legislation that would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite citizens to mainland China.</p>
      <p>The legislation was suspended but protesters are now asking for an investigation into police violence.</p>
