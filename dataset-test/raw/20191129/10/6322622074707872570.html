      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 29): Poultry farmer QL Resources Bhd saw its net profit rise 15.1% to RM69.68 million in its second financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (2QFY20) from RM60.52 million a year ago, mainly due to higher sales from its marine product manufacturing (MPM) segment.</p>
      <p>This resulted in a higher earnings per share of 4.29 sen for 2QFY20 compared with 3.73 sen for 2QFY19.</p>
      <p>Revenue for the quarter rose 16.6% to RM1.07 billion from RM920.26 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>In a bourse filing today, QL Resources said the MPM segment's earnings for the quarter increased 36% due to higher contributions from fishmeal and surimi-based products.</p>
      <p>The palm oil activities (POA) segment also saw earnings improve in 2QFY20 despite lower sales, due to higher oil extraction rate and foreign exchange translation gain.</p>
      <p>The integrated livestock farming segment's earnings increased 2% year-on-year in 2QFY20 on higher contribution from Indonesia and Sabah poultry units operation, which was offset by unrealised quarterly biological assets fair value fluctuations.</p>
      <p>The strong quarter performance lifted the group's net profit for the cumulative six months (1HFY20) up by 15.2% to RM120.23 million from RM104.38 million a year ago, while revenue grew 19% to RM2.07 billion from RM1.74 billion in 1HFY19.</p>
      <p>On prospects for the remaining year ending March 31, 2020, QL Resources said it is confident that its performance will be better than FY19.</p>
      <p>Shares in QL Resources closed five sen lower at RM7.25 today, bringing it a market capitalisation of RM11.76 billion.</p>
