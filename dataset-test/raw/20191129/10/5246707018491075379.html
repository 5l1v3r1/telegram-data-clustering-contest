      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a></b> - Nintendo's latest attempt to get gamers off the sofa and into shape by gamifying your exercise regimen - has been on shelves for nearly a month-and-a-half now and it seems to have gone down very well indeed with Switch gamers. That's certainly the case in Japan where it has released <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/information/2019/1129.html">a statement on its website</a> apologising for stock shortages.</p>
      <p>This comes in <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/japanese_charts_pokemon_sword_and_shield_is_still_flying_off_shelves_as_switch_dominates">a particularly strong sales week for Nintendo</a> where the company claimed 95% of all console sales in Japan. Putting out <a href="https://twitter.com/nintendo/status/1200341909849292800?s=21">a link on its official Twitter account</a>, the company has apologised to both customers and retailers for the supply shortage and promises to increase the number of shipments before the year is out:</p>

      <p>Ring Fit Adventure got off to a great start worldwide when it launched in mid-October, especially in Nintendo's homeland where the most recent charts have it sitting in second place beyond the all-conquering <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b>. Total sales of 290,081 units in Japan might not sound like much next to Pokémon's <i>1,740,084</i> games sold, but it's obviously performing better than Nintendo anticipated.</p>
      <p>The game has been popular with a wide audience, including "a lot of women" <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/a_lot_of_ring_fit_adventure_users_are_between_20_and_30_years_old_according_to_nintendo">according to Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa</a>. The Pilates ring-style tension-sensing peripheral that comes with the game obviously makes digital sales impossible, so the company will be anxious to replenish stock as soon as possible during the busy holiday period.</p>
      <p>For our money, it combines exercise with gaming more successfully than <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_fit">Wii Fit</a></b> ever did and may be the perfect thing to help beat the belly-growth this festive season.
