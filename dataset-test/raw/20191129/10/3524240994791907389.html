      <h1>Ibrahimovic files ‘hate crime’ complaint after house, statue vandalised</h1>

      <p>Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic Thursday filed a “hate crime” complaint Thursday after being the target of vandalism and racists threats, police said, a day after the star announced his part ownership in football club Hammarby.</p>
      <p>A statue of the player in Malmo was attacked with fire and paint while the word “Judas” was daubed across the front door of his residence in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>The perpetrators of the threatening acts have not been identified but “Ibra” angered fans of Malmo FF (MFF) — the club where he started his professional career in 1999 — on Wednesday when he announced he had bought a share in rival club Hammarby.</p>
      <p>In Malmo, several people, most of them wearing hoods, vandalised a statue of Ibrahimovic that was unveiled just two months ago. Near the monument, they wrote the words “Cigani do” (“Gypsy” in Bosnian, and “die” in Swedish) in spray paint.</p>
      <p>Born in Malmo, Ibrahimovic is the son of a Bosnian father and Croatian mother.</p>
      <p>Videos posted on social media showed masked people lighting fires and aiming them at the statue. There was no significant damage and a protective barrier has since been put up around it.</p>
      <p>“An investigation has been opened into vandalism and threats with suspected hate crime motive. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is the plaintiff,” a police spokesman told <i>AFP.</i></p>
      <p>Earlier on Wednesday, angry supporters had slipped a toilet seat on to one of the statue’s arms.</p>
      <p>Hammarby, a Stockholm-based team playing alongside MFF in Sweden’s top league, announced Wednesday morning that Ibrahimovic had bought around 25 per cent of the shares in the club.</p>
      <p>“He’s turned his back on the city and what made him who he is,” Kaveh Hosseinpour, vice-president of the MFF supporters’ club, told broadcaster TV4.</p>
      <p>At noon on Thursday, nearly 7,000 people had signed an online petition calling for the immediate removal of his statue in Malmo.</p>
      <p>“How could you do this to us?” one outraged signatory wrote while another proclaimed that “everything can’t just be about money”.</p>
      <p>In Stockholm, the door of the former Juventus, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United forward’s home was covered with the word “Judas,” and a tin of “surstromming,” a notoriously smelly fermented herring had been opened and poured outside the building.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic, whose contract with Los Angeles Galaxy expires at the end of the year, has not announced whether he will continue his career at another club.</p>
