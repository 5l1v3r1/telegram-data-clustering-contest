      <p>It will be a battle of east versus west Sunday when the gates open for the Grade 1, $300,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Matriarch_Stakes">Matriarch Stakes</a></b> on closing day at Del Mar.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Got_Stormy">Got Stormy</a></b> has made the return trip to Southern California for trainer Mark Casse following her runner-up effort in the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park, while Chad Brown invades from New York the one-mile feature with Grade 2 winner <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Significant_Form">Significant Form</a></b>. Not to be left out, trainer George Weaver has sent out Grade 3 winner Daddy is a Legend from his eastern base, and Brad Cox ships in Juliet Foxtrot. Among the local hopefuls are a pair for trainer Neil Drysdale: Toinette and Simply Breathless, who just ran 1-2 at this distance in the Nov. 3 Goldikova (G2) at Santa Anita. That was the fourth victory in the last five starts for Toinette, who has been patiently brought up the ranks by Drysdale. Got Stormy will be back against her own gender after three straight starts against males, which includes a win in the Fourstardave (G1) at Saratoga in August. The daughter of Get Stormy has amassed $1.25 million in career earnings and has hit the board in all seven starts this year with three wins. “She’s been solid all year,” said Shane Tripp, assistant to Casse. “What she did at Saratoga, winning two stakes a week apart, kind of speaks for itself. She shows up every time. Significant Form, a 4-year-old that cost $575,000 as a yearling, has taken a big step forward this year for owner Stephanie Seymour Brant. The daughter of Creative Cause won the Intercontinental (G3) at Belmont when making her belated seasonal debut in June and added wins in the Ballston Spa (G2) at Saratoga in August and the Noble Damsel (G3) at Belmont last time out on Sept. 21. For Juliet Foxtrot, this is also a return trip to Southern California. She shipped west this summer and was beaten a nose by Vasilika in the 1 ?-mile John C. Mabee (G2) at Del Mar, which was followed by another runner-up finish behind Uni most recently in the First Lady (G1) at Keeneland on Oct. 15. The Matriarch goes as Race 7, with post time 6 p.m. ET, on Sunday, with the card also featuring Breeders' Cup Turf runner-up United's return in the Hollywood Turf Cup (G2) and aspiring 2-year-olds in the Cecil B. DeMille (G3). The Matriarch field in post position order with riders: 1. Storm the Hill (Rafael Bejarano) 2. Lakerball (Evin Roman) 3. Significant Form (John Velazquez) 4. Mucho Unusual (Abel Cedillo) 5. Toinette (Flavien Prat) 6. Simply Breathless (Drayden Van Dyke) 7. Got Stormy (Tyler Gaffalione) 8. Painting Corners (Paco Lopez) 9. Daddy is a Legend (Manny Franco) 10. Giza Goddess (Brice Blanc) 11. Juliet Foxtrot (Julien Leparoux)</p>
