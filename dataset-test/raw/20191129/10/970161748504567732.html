      <p>Ray Parlour has been branded a hypocrite by AFTV regular MR DT after the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> legend claimed supporters were happy when the team loses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> is facing the sack after last night’s farcical 2-1 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a> defeat against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eintracht-frankfurt/">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>, played out in front of a half empty Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has presided over a calamitous run of just one win from the last nine matches and looks set to be given his marching orders today, less than a month after he was given a vote of confidence by the club’s board.</p>
      <p>AFTV, a YouTube channel with over one million subscribers, has established its reputation as the outspoken, unofficial, voice of the club’s fanbase with cult personalities such as DT regularly attracting over 100,000 views.</p>
      <p>Indeed, his post match verdict on last night’s defeat, during which he called on the board to end Emery’s reign, has already been played on 421,000 occasions.</p>

      <p>Parlour, however, believes the channel has benefited and indeed profits from the negativity which currently surrounds the club.</p>
      <p>He told talkSPORT: ‘How can they call it Arsenal 𝘍𝘢𝘯 TV?’</p>
      <p>‘AFTV want <span dir="ltr">Arsenal</span> to lose as it is better for them. They should call it Arsenal Fail TV.’</p>
      <p>DT, the channel’s most popular personality, who himselfs commands a subscriber base of 226,000, took issue with Parlour’s comments, reminding the 46-year-old he has been a guest on their shows in the past.</p>
      <p>He wrote on Twitter: ‘You were not calling it that when you were on there, Ray.</p>
      <p>‘You might be a legend of the club but it does not mean you can go around talking rubbish about fans who go to every single game and saying they enjoy losing, it’s the radio show YOU work for that enjoy seeing Arsenal lose!’</p>
