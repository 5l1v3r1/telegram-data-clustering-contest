      <h3>Piers Morgan says that he wants Mauricio Pochettino, Carlo Ancelotti or Massimiliano Allegri to succeed Unai Emery at Arsenal.</h3>
      <p>The north London side confirmed the sacking of Emery on Friday morning in the wake of their 2-1 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have been struggling to find any consistent form in recent weeks and they suffered a disappointing loss in front of their home fans as boos rang out around the ground at the final whistle in what turned out to be Emery’s final game in charge.</p>
      <p>After Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had give the home side the lead on the stroke of half-time, Daichi Kamada netted twice in nine second-half minutes for the visitors to fire them to victory.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg will take temporary charge of first-team affairs at The Emirates as Arsenal begin their search for a long-term successor for Emery.</p>
      <p>Former <i>Daily Mirror</i> editor and celebrity Arsenal fan Morgan, who had been vocal in his criticism of Emery in recent weeks, took to social media on Friday morning to offer his thoughts on who should be appointed next at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>Asked by one user who he wants to take over, Morgan <a href="https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1200362901816664065">tweeted</a>: “Pochettino, Ancelotti or Allegri.”</p>
      <p>Whether Pochettino would be willing to take over at Arsenal having only just been sacked by their fierce local rivals Tottenham Hotspur remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Arsenal do not have long to dust themselves down as they prepare for their Premier League trip to Norwich City on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Gunners will then take on Brighton at home on Thursday next week in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are currently on their longest winless run in all competitions since February 1992, with the Gunners having failed to win in their last six outings.</p>
