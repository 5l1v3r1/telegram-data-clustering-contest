      <h2>Latest Wolves news includes Arsenal fans pushing for Nuno appointment after Emery is sacked as manager</h2>

      <p>Arsenal have sacked Unai Emery – and Gunners fans are itching for Nuno Espirito Santo to replace him.</p>
      <p>Emery had come under increasing pressure after a dreadful run of form which has seen Arsenal go eight games without a win.</p>
      <p>The Europa League defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, which was played out in front of thousands of empty seats at the Emirates, was the final straw for Arsenal’s board.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Emery has been sacked today (Friday), with club chiefs bringing forward their decision on the Spaniard.</a>

      <p>It is understood that the board had planned to give Emery until the summer to turn things around but the situation became more immediate.</p>
      <p>Emery’s departure will ramp up speculation surrounding <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo,</a> with the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> boss said to be on Arsenal’s shortlist of potential replacements.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are impressed with Nuno's work at Wolves and their Head of Football, Raul Sanllehi, has a close relationship with Nuno's agent Jorge Mendes.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the news, one Arsenal fan said: "He's managed in Spain, Portugal and took a club in the Championship to the Premier League and last 32 of Europe in a season and a half and currently sits above us in the table... He's got much more to show for himself than Arteta."</p>
      <p>"If we get Nuno Espirito, let him sign Ruben Neves from Wolves," added another. "He is a quality defensive midfield player. He should also go for Ruben Dias from @SLBenfica and Upamecano from @RBLeipzig_EN."</p>
      <p>A third simply said: "Nuno for me!"</p>
      <p>"I’d say Nuno or Arteta," remarked a Gunners supporter. "Nuno being the first choice."</p>
      <p>A fifth said: "NUNO!"</p>
