      <p>Arsenal are considering opening talks with Napoli coach <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/sports">Carlo Ancelotti</a> regarding taking over as Unai Emery’s long-term successor, the Telegraph reports.</p>
      <p>The North London club appointed Freddie Ljungberg interim boss at the Emirates following Emery’s dismissal on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti’s Napoli have struggled to produce good results this term and his contract with the Partenopei runs out at the end of the season, meaning the famously trigger-happy chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis may have little issue in releasing the coach early.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti would join Wolves’ Nuno Espirito Santo and former Gunners skipper Mikel Arteta as potential candidates should he become available.</p>
