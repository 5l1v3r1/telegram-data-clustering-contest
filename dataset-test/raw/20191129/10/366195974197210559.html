      <p>After teaming up with Benny The Butcher last month for their <i>Statue of Limitation</i> EP, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/smoke-dza/profile">Smoke DZA</a> is back today with his second collaborative project of 2019, this time linking up with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/CurrenSy/profile">Curren$y</a> for their highly anticipated project <i>Prestige Worldwide</i>, which is a reference to the comedy movie <i>Step Brothers</i>.</p>
      <p>The 10-track effort is led by the previously heard single "3 Minute Manual," and contains other song titles like “Cinderella Story” and “Inhale,” the latter of which features <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/daveeast/profile">Dave East</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/StylesP/profile">Styles P</a>. Meanwhile, production is handled by the likes of Monstabeatz, 183rd, Girl Talk, Buda Da <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Future/profile">Future</a>, and Grandz Muzik, among others. It follows up the duo's first collab project <i>The Stage</i>, which dropped way back in 2010.</p>
      <p>Suggest you roll one up and enjoy the new smokey vibes from DZA &amp; Spitta on this Black Friday.</p>
