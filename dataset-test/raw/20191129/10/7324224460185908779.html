      <h2>Britain’s oldest twins Lil and Doris re-lived their cherished childhood memory of riding a steam train through the British countryside.</h2>

      <p>It was part of a national campaign to challenge preconceptions around what older people are capable of.</p>
      <p>The 95-year-old social media sensations from Tipton took the trip to prove that age is no barrier to having fun or living out your dreams.</p>

      <p>Lilian Cox and Doris Hobday departed from Chester Station on November 4 aboard the Northern Belle, over eight decades on from when they first rode a steam train from the West Midlands to London in the 1930s. After a seven course dinner, the train stopped overlooking stunning Morecambe Bay, where Lil and Doris had front-row seats for a spectacular fireworks display.</p>
      <p>The trip was organised as part of leading experience gift company Red Letter Days’ #NoMoreSlippers campaign, which has been set up to improve how we treat older people over the festive period, and encourage families to empower older relatives to do what they love.</p>
      <p>The campaign has the backing of Action for Elders and Age Space, as well as notable celebrities including Kim Woodburn and Gloria Hunniford.</p>

      <p>Doris said: “We thoroughly enjoyed reliving the excitement of making a journey by rail. It felt like we were young girls again.</p>
      <p>“We know we’re incredibly lucky to still have our health, but we really do want to encourage everybody over the age of 70 to continue to get out there and do the things you love, whilst you can. It’s never too late to have an adventure.</p>
      <p>“Life has so much to offer and you never know what’s around the corner – as our recent adventures show! We never anticipated being on TV or in the newspapers at the age of 95.</p>

      <p>“We’d like to say thank you to Red Letter Days for making this dream come true for us.</p>
      <p>"We’ve really loved the fireworks and the opportunity to spend time with each other and our family members on the Northern Belle.”</p>
      <p>Dan Mountain, CEO of Red Letter Days, said: “We were delighted to be able to make Lil and Doris’ Christmas wish come true this year. They are proof that over-65s continue to maintain a real sense of adventure and excitement.</p>

      <p>“They are the perfect candidates to showcase what over-65s across the UK really want this Christmas.”</p>
      <p>Ageism is a rising issue in the UK, despite the fact that adults over the age of 65 contribute £152 billion to the UK economy each year through employment, caregiving and volunteering.</p>
      <p>Red Letter Days’ #NoMoreSlippers campaign, is challenging preconceptions about what older people are capable of and reminding everyone to ask and listen to loved ones’ Christmas wishes, rather than making assumptions.</p>
