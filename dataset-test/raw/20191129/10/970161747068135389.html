      <p>A self-conscious granddad ‘just wants to fall in love’ after naval cancer left a gaping hole in his face.</p>
      <p>Stephen White, 51, from Exeter, has become a recluse since drastic surgery left him without a nose or any top teeth.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-three, who has eight grandchildren, said he is living like a ‘vampire’ because he is too ashamed to go out in daylight.</p>
      <p>He would like to start <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> but says he doesn’t have the confidence because his appearance ‘scares’ people.</p>
      <p>The former sales assistant said: ‘I scare my grandchildren and when I go out in the street I scare, not just children, but everybody. People look at me and cross the road to avoid me.</p>
      <p>‘The cancer was right in the middle of my face and I’m still waiting for a new nose. If it wasn’t so visible I’d feel like I’d be able to date again. Really all I want is to fall in love.’</p>

      <p>Stephen discovered he had nasal cancer four years ago, when he had a cold and noticed his nose was bleeding.</p>

      <p>An MRI scan showed the bone at the end of his nose had been ‘eaten away’ by cancer and was spreading towards the back of his brain.</p>
      <p>He has been waiting for a prosthetic nose since 2015 and suffered from impaired vision as he has been unable to wear his glasses.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Before I had laser eye surgery last month, I could not see further than the end of my arm without my glasses. I couldn’t put my glasses on because there was nothing to rest them on.</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t go out because I couldn’t see to cross the road and would be paranoid about bumping into people, as I couldn’t see them until they were a yard in front of me.</p>
      <p>‘Then they would look at my face and see I didn’t have a nose. It destroyed my self-confidence and I now have no self-esteem.’</p>

      <p>According to the NHS, nasal cancer is very rare. It develops in the nasal cavity behind the nose and most often affects men over 40.</p>
      <p>Stephen said doctors had never seen anything like his cancer before and had no choice but to operate on his nose to save his life.</p>
      <p>However, he wasn’t expecting to wake up without one when he went in for surgery.</p>
      <p>‘They were talking about having to remove my nose altogether and fitting a prosthetic, or cutting into it and replacing the bridge with bone from my rib and skin from my forehead’ he recalled.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘But they didn’t really know what they could do until they’d cut it open. I can’t remember how long the operation was but it felt like it took hours.</p>
      <p>‘When I woke up, I had no teeth, top palate or nose because they saw the cancer was attacking my palate and gums.</p>
      <p>‘And they removed my teeth anticipating that the radiotherapy treatment later on would destroy the enamel and they would rot away. I couldn’t speak because my teeth had gone.’</p>

      <p>Stephen said he ‘burst into tears’ when he first looked in the mirror as he feared people would think he was a ‘monster’.<i>‘</i></p>
      <p>He thought his ‘life was over’ and felt depressed as he spent months on a diet of mushy food while going through aggressive radiotherapy treatment to remove the cancer.</p>
      <p>He has been going back and forth trying to get a prosthetic nose fitted, and last month had to pay over £3000 for laser eye surgery, as he did not qualify for free treatment on the NHS.</p>
      <p>Although this has had a huge improvement on his life, his confidence remains at rock bottom.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I used to go and visit my grandchildren on the train, but I haven’t done that for years because I’m scared to be near all the people.</p>
      <p>‘Mums with prams will steer their buggies away from me. I look at people and they will cross the road. It’s soul-destroying.</p>

      <p>‘Now I would just like to find love. I want to find a girlfriend who will love me like I would love her.</p>

      <p>‘I think once I have my new nose I will feel more confident to go out and meet someone.</p>
      <p>‘I used to go to the pub and see friends, but over the last five years that’s gone down the toilet. I just want to be treated like a decent human being.’</p>
      <p>Family members are now trying to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/get-stevie-back-on-his-feet">raise money via GoFundMe</a> to help Stephen get back on his feet and pay for any remaining work he may need doing, as well as to buy him a car, so he can visit them and have a social life.</p>
