      <h1>WATCH: Kim Kardashian and JLo filmed a new ad – but A-Rod was the real star of it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:11:21+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez teamed up to shoot a new ad for Portal from Facebook – a video calling service – but neither of them were the star of the show.</p>
      <p>In the short clip posted on Instagram, the two video call one another to chat about ideas for their upcoming holiday party.</p>
      <p>"Kim, I love that portal lets us have time together," JLo says, to which Kim responds, "I know right." The <i>Hustlers </i>actress and reality star are both in their homes, chatting to one another with face masks on.</p>
      <p>Then, in walks Alex Rodriguez with a bright pink face mask of his own, right before Kim is about to reveal her "top-secret" party plans. "Oh. Hi, Kim. So, what are we talking about?" he asks.</p>
      <p>"Oh, just stuff..." JLo says.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, stuff..." Kim responds.</p>
      <p>"I love stuff," he says, and there’s a clear, very awkward silence. "This is such fun. We should do this more often."</p>

      <p>We’re not too sure what the top-secret holiday plans will end up being – no thanks to A-Rod – but it looks like both families spent Thanksgiving at home.</p>
      <p>Kim shared a few snaps of her day with the kids writing, "So thankful for all of my babies."</p>
