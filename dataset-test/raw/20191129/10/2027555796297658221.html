      <h1>Rupee slips 11 paise to 71.73 against USD ahead of GDP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:15:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Indian rupee opened on a weak note and fell 11 paise to 71.73 against the US dollar in early trade on Friday, as investors traded the cautious path ahead of the release of GDP data.</p>
      <p>Forex traders said rupee is trading in a narrow range as investors are also awaiting clarity on the US-China trade front.</p>
      <p>At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 71.63 then fell to 71.73 against the US dollar, showing a decline of 11 paise over its previous closing.</p>
      <p>The Indian rupee on Thursday had closed at 71.62 against the US dollar.</p>
      <p>The second-quarter GDP number is scheduled to be announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>India's economy grew at 5 per cent in the first quarter of 2019-20 -- the slowest pace in over six years.</p>
      <p>Traders said muted opening in domestic equities dragged the local unit, while, easing crude oil prices and sustained foreign fund inflows supported the rupee and restricted the fall.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.41 per cent to USD 63.61 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net buyers in the capital markets, as they purchased shares worth Rs 1,008.89 crore on Thursday, as per provisional data.</p>
      <p>Domestic bourses opened on a cautious note on Friday with benchmark indices Sensex trading 138.95 points down at 40,991.22 and Nifty lower by 41 points at 12,110.15.</p>
      <p>The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.05 per cent to 98.32.</p>
      <p>The 10-year government bond yield was at 6.47 per cent in morning trade.</p>
