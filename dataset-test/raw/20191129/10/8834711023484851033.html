      <h1>D-day: Court To Rule On Jacob Zuma’s Appeal Against Corruption Trial</h1>

      <p>DURBAN – Former President Jacob Zuma and co-accused Thales will know if they can take their case to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) after the High Court in Pietermaritzburg ruled that they must stand trial.</p>
      <p>Last week, Zuma’s lawyers argued that the SCA may arrive at a different conclusion and Zuma may eventually be granted a permanent stay of prosecution.</p>
      <p>However, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) opposed Zuma’s application, saying the prospects of him succeeding at the appeal court are slim.</p>
      <p>Last week, the NPA’s Andrew Breytenbach accused Zuma of delay tactics, saying that the former president did not offer rational or compelling reasons for why he must not stand trial.</p>
      <p>Zuma’s lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane argued that the former president will be prejudiced if the case proceeds.</p>
      <p>He argued that there had been political interference in the matter, but this argument was quickly squashed by judge Thoba Poyo-Dlwati, who said this had not been widely accepted.</p>
      <p>Zuma faces charges of corruption, fraud and racketeering linked to the arms deal.</p>
      <p>His counsel has also argued that there have been too many delays and therefore the case should be dismissed, a charge dismissed by the prosecution.</p>
