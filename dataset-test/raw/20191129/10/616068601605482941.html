      <p>The rubber is about to meet the road when it comes to short-term housing rentals in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>The city announced that its licensing compliance is now underway, meaning those who are operating a short-term rental without a business licence will now be subject to compliance action and fines.</p>
      <p>The city says less than half of the approximately 1,300 short-term rentals that are currently listed online are licensed.</p>
