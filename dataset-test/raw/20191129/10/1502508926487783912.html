      <p>The Indian rupee opened on a weak note and fell 11 paise to 71.73 against the US dollar in early trade on Friday as investors traded the cautious path ahead of release of GDP data.</p>

      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold-prices">Gold prices </a>traded higher with market anticipations that China will retaliate to the US move of passing a law to support human rights of Hong Kong protesters," Patel added.</p>
