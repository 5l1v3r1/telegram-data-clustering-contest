      <p>Roxanne wrote: ‘It’s Thanksgiving here in America &amp; I want to share something with you all. This time last year, I was in my scruffs, sobbing into a bowl of mac n cheese, having not showered for days. Then my mam (picture Sally Field in Steel Magnolias) gave me some tough love &amp; told me to start counting my blessings instead of licking my wounds &amp; dwelling on disappointments.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘She told me to notice the people that were there &amp; holding me up, not the ones who had left &amp; knocked me down. She told me that I had a lot to be thankful for &amp; she was right. (She’s always right!) The next day I began to practice gratitude. I’ve never been majorly religious but I can now say I’ve seen the power of prayer. I’d close my eyes &amp; list the things I was lucky to have. My health being the first &amp; foremost as it’s something we do all take for granted at times.</p>
      <p>‘I thanked God for my mam &amp; aunty, for my home, for the friends who were by my side, for all of the beautiful moments I’ve had in my life. I prayed with gratitude but didn’t ask for anything, I just created a storyboard of blessings in my mind, things I had lost sight of.’</p>
      <p>The actress continued: ‘As I began to realise how lucky I actually was, the tough times that had broken me soon faded into the background. I began to see my life change shape for the better. A day at a time. It was almost like the moment I looked for the good, it actually blossomed into a better view from where I was standing.</p>

      <p>‘A year on as I write this, so much has changed, within me &amp; around me. My mind-frame more than anything &amp; my ability to recognise how lucky I am. I’m more stronger now than ever &amp; yet I’m softer too. I see now that it’s possible to be both!</p>

      <p>‘To anyone who is in the midst of their darkness right now, I promise you, with the right thought process you can &amp; will come through it, as I have. Just find little blessings in every day &amp; let those overshadow the difficulties.</p>
      <p>‘To those who never gave up on me, I’m so grateful for you in my corner.</p>
      <p>‘And to my incredible man @bklynbad who saw my fire &amp; ran towards it not away from it, thank you for loving me. ❤️ #happythanksgiving.’</p>

      <p>Jason commented: ‘Love you Roxx’, before paying tribute to his bride-to-be on his own Instagram page.</p>
      <p>He wrote: ‘It’s hard to put into words how thankful I am this Thanksgiving. This time of year used to be incredibly hard for me, now I look forward to bringing in some amazing new memories ❤️. I know my mom is looking down on me and smiling at the man that I’ve become and can see her son is truly happy.’</p>
      <p>Roxanne also continued her lovey-dovey sharing by showing off her whopper engagement ring on her Instagram stories.</p>
      <p>It was revealed in August that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/12/roxanne-pallett-shows-off-new-man-seven-months-splitting-fiance-lee-walton-10559430/">Roxanne was living in the US and dating Jason,</a> seven months after she was dumped by her fiancé Lee Walton.</p>

      <p>The engagement comes just over a year after Roxanne sparked one of the biggest controversies in Big Brother history.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The TV star accused former Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas of punching her ‘repeatedly, intentionally and aggressively’ during a play fight, and went to the diary room to tell producers that she did not feel safe.</p>
      <p>However, after she left the CBB house of her own accord, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/03/roxanne-pallett-says-she-got-it-wrong-as-she-gives-first-interview-on-ryan-thomas-punch-7907758/">Roxanne admitted that she ‘got it wrong’</a>, saying: ‘I massively apologise to not only Ryan, but his friends, his family, his fans, every single person who watched that and who justifiably saw an overreaction to what wasn’t a malicious act. Because I am sensitive, I mistook what was playful.</p>
      <p>‘There was no malicious intention behind that, and that is what I apologise for because I shouldn’t have questioned his motivation. I got it wrong.’</p>
      <p>Pallett this year revealed that she considered taking her own life following the backlash, which saw her dropped from a radio job and a panto role.</p>
      <p>Ryan went on to win CBB, and he is expecting a baby with partner Lucy Mecklenburgh.</p>
