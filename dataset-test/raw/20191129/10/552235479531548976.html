      <h1>Winter weather on election day could cost West Dunbartonshire Council over £45,000</h1>
      <h2>The local authority has put stringent preparations in place to ensure that everyone can have their say in next month's vote.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:16:23+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:16</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>The sum of £45,000 could be ploughed into clearing routes to polling stations in West Dunbartonshire if bad weather hits on the day of the general election.</p>
      <p>Chiefs have drawn up a contingency plan which also outlines that 60 staff will be on standby to either grit areas or deal with flooding concerns, including monitoring drains for blockages.</p>
      <p>In a report by the roads and transportation department that is set to be presented at tomorrow’s (Wednesday) full council meeting, the total cost of ensuring that adverse weather doesn’t prevent people having their say has been calculated at £45,330.</p>
      <p>The plans would see each of the area’s 30 polling stations allocated into one of 13 clusters, with each being kept clear by a team of four operatives who will be tasked with ensuring the area is properly gritted.</p>
      <p>A review of polling stations was also carried out in relation to their position on priority gritting routes, with it determined that the majority will require additional focus on December 12 as a result of their location.</p>
      <p>Further to this a team of four operatives will be on standby to undertake flood prevention measures in the event of serious rainfall.</p>
      <p>According to the report this will require a total of 60 council workers from the greenspace and housing maintenance teams to be on call.</p>
      <p>As a result, standby payments totalling £5447 will be paid to all 60 operatives - with the cost of potential overtime calculated to be £32,400.</p>
      <p>A further £4483 will be spent on salt while the use of vehicles outwith standard working hours comes in at £3000.</p>
      <p>The report concludes by outlining that the preparations should ensure that the UK’s first winter December election since 1923 runs as smoothly as possible, and stresses that the £45,000 top figure would only be in the event of seriously slippery conditions.</p>
      <p>It states: “The total cost of £9,930 for stand-by and salt purchase detailed above provides a high degree of confidence in responding to adverse weather.</p>
      <p>“The weather forecast will determine the actual hours of treatment required.</p>
      <p>“The costs may be greater if weather is severe and/or prolonged but will be less if weather conditions are favourable.”</p>
