      <h1>Jose Mourinho ‘slows’ Tottenham signing – Mauricio Pochettino was big backer of deal</h1>

      <p>When Jose Mourinho walked through the door at Tottenham Hotspur, there was quickly worry in the Seville media about what would happen with Giovani Lo Celso.</p>
      <p>That the Argentine hasn’t got off the bench since the change in manager has further increased the doubt growing around Real Betis.</p>
      <p>Spurs signed Lo Celso on loan for a €16m fee. <a href="https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/betis/2019/11/28/mourinho-frena-compra-celso/254510.html">Estadio Deportivo</a> report Tottenham can either make the transfer permanent in January for €32m plus bonuses, or for €40m in the summer.</p>
      <p>It’s previously been reported the Premier League club have to make the purchase a full one if they qualify for next season’s Champions League, however, they’re currently nine points from fourth position.</p>
      <p>Estadio Deportivo, a newspaper local to Betis, reports Mourinho’s arrival ‘slows’ Lo Celso’s full signing, and it’s explained it was very much Mauricio Pochettino behind the summer deal.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have recently been linked with Bruno Fernandes again, and he scored twice and contributed two assists as Sporting beat PSV 4-0 on Thursday evening. It’s unlikely the club would have both next season, so perhaps it’s a question of choosing.</p>
