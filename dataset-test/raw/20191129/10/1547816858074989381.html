      <p>Yeh Hai Mohabbatein stars Karan Patel and Divyanka Tripathi’s onscreen chemistry is scintillating and we have been seeing that ever since the show was aired on television. Though their chemistry is loved by their fans, rumours were rife stating that Divyanka and some issues with Karan and all is not well between the two for quite some time now. Amid all the rumours, Karan decided to put these rumours to rest as he has put across a clarification statement for all those who believed these rumours.</p>
      <p>The actor recently spoke Pinkvilla where he revealed his equation with his co-star which seemed pretty reasonable. While speaking to the portal, he was quoted saying, “I won’t call it problems but yes, I had the habit of coming on the sets late, so I don’t complain of her being cranky about it because why should she wait if I am late, as simple as that. But that is it. Other than that, we are great friends and have a great onscreen and off-screen chemistry. We wish well for each other. Apart from this, I think we should just let the tongues wagging because it anyway keeps you in the limelight.”</p>

      <p>Well, this can be true as recently, Divyanka shared a lovely picture of Raman aka Karan Patel was seen posing with Ishita on her Instagram handle, getting fans bubbling with joy. During the same interview, he also talked about Bigg Boss 13 where he said he doesn’t see himself in the Bigg Boss house as he thinks that he doesn’t have the temperament to be with that kind of people and cannot stoop down to the level of being that violent.</p>
