      <p>Unai Emery has been sacked as manager of Arsenal, as the US owners of the English Premier League club respond to poor results and as disgruntled fans stay away from matches.</p>
      <p>The Spanish coach was removed from his post on Friday, the day after a 2-1 loss against Germany’s Eintracht Frankfurt, a match that was played in front of a half full Emirates stadium, the London team’s home ground.</p>
      <p>The club is owned by Stan Kroenke, the US billionaire sports mogul, who appointed Emery to succeed longtime first team manager Arsène Wenger 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>The club said: “The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, Josh Kroenke, Stan’s son, said: “Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand. We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success.”</p>
      <p>Assistant coach Freddie Ljungberg has been promoted to lead the first team on an interim basis until a permanent successor is found.</p>
