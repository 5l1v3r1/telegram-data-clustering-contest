      <p>Black Friday got off to a very, very quiet start this morning.</p>
      <p>It seems the days of people fighting over a reduced price TV in a car park for the annual sales event are over.</p>
      <p>Busy shopping areas such as London’s Oxford St were basically empty before stores opened up.</p>
      <p>There was one solitary queue outside JD Sports, but that was about it.</p>
      <p>It was similarly silent in other areas of the country, with Twitter user David Pollitt posting a picture of himself standing alone in a Tesco queue in Accrington, Lancashire.</p>
      <p>He wrote: ‘3:50 am at tesco Accrington and I’m the only 1 here waiting for it to open at 5 am.</p>
      <p>‘Things you do for a good deal for the kids Christmas presents #BlackFriday #minus1 #Christmas2019.’</p>

      <p>Black Friday, which is an import from the US, hasn’t really taken off inside stores in the UK.</p>
      <p>A lot of this is due to the fact people prefer to stay at home and order deals from the internet, according to PwC.</p>
      <p>A survey from PwC revealed 77% of UK customers would be shopping online for bargains.</p>
      <p>A study from Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) also showed only 16% of the UK public believed Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals were genuinely some of the best prices they’d see all year.</p>
      <p>CIM CEO Chris Daly said: ‘Clearly, authenticity about the deals on offer is impacting consumer confidence, and this is not good news for brands interested in winning the long-term loyalty of their customers.</p>
      <p>‘Consumers are relying on discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Monday to shop more smartly in the run up to Christmas, but they will not be taken advantage of.’</p>
      <p>UK retailers were still expected to make recoup a record £2.5billion in sales this year so it’s not all bad news.</p>

      <p>The Black Friday sales aren’t going as well in the US as in previous years after they kicked off on Thanks Giving yesterday.</p>
      <p>With six fewer holiday shopping season days than last year, it will be the shortest season since 2013 because Thanksgiving fell on the fourth Thursday in November – the latest possible date it could be.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>That means customers will have less time to shop and retailers will have less time to woo them.</p>
      <p>Adobe Analytics predicts a loss of $1 billion (£775m) in online revenue from a shortened season.</p>
      <p>Still, it expects online sales will reach $143.7 billion (£111b), up 14.1% from last year’s holiday season</p>
