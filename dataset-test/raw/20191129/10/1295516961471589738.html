      <p>Scarlett Johansson, a staple of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, revealed what drew her to the franchise in the first place.</p>
      <p>Johansson, who plays Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, had her interest piqued by 2008's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/iron-man-film/"><i>Iron Man</i></a>. "I just loved it," she told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/scarlett-johansson-oscars-issue-cover-story"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>. "I’d never really seen anything like it before. It was not particularly that I was a fan of superhero stuff or that genre, but it seemed groundbreaking. And I wanted to work with Marvel. It seemed like an exciting place to be."</p>

      <p>Johannson went on to discuss her initial meetings with both Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and <i>Iron Man 2 </i>director Jon Favreau. While she admits she loved Favreau<i>, </i>the role of Romanoff originally went to Emily Blunt. "I remember being in a random hotel somewhere," she recalled. "And I got that call and I was so, so disappointed. And then that was it. You know, life went on. I mean, I’ve certainly had enough experience of rejection."</p>

      <p>Blunt, however, was forced to bow out of the film, and the role ultimately went to Johansson. "I was super excited about it," she said. "And I met with Jon again, and we had a funny conversation about how he had not cast me. But I was excited. I was so stoked."</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-black-widow-death-bad/">Romanoff sacrificed herself</a> to help Hawkeye claim the soul stone in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, Johansson will reprise the role once more in the upcoming <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-widow-movie/"><i>Black Widow </i></a>solo film.</p>
