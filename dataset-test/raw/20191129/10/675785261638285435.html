      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer defends Paul Pogba as Man Utd star set for Jose Mourinho reunion</h1>
      <h2>Pogba returned to the UK on Thursday when he touched down at Heathrow and is now set to return to first-team training, in a boost to United boss Solskjaer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:05:27+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has defended <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-pogba">Paul Pogba</a> after the Frenchman’s return to the UK, insisting he remains committed to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>And Pogba could return to action to take on former boss Jose Mourinho next week.</p>
      <p>Pogba has been absent since August with an ankle injury, suffered against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>He has been rehabbing in both Dubai and Miami, and last week caused something of a storm by posting pictures of himself playing basketball in the US.</p>
      <p>Having spent several weeks with his right foot strapped in a brace, the World Cup winner was pictured on the court with Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler.</p>

      <p>That came amid claims in Spain that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> are preparing to move for Pogba once more in January, with Zinedine Zidane still desperate to take his compatriot to the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>But Pogba landed back at Heathrow on Thursday, and was due at Carrington on Friday.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer insists Pogba has done nothing wrong and while the Frenchman will miss Sunday’s meeting with Aston Villa, he could return for a reunion with Mourinho when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> visit Old Trafford on Wednesday night.</p>

      <p>"Every player is allowed to be injured when he's injured,” said Solskjaer. "Paul is working hard to be back and no-one can doubt his professionalism or his willingness or desire to play football.</p>
      <p>"He's a footballer and he's also one of the best midfielders in the world, so it will be like signing a new player before the transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>"Of course we've missed him while he's been away. Some of the players, like Scott McTominay and Fred, have taken up that (midfield) challenge and have done well but, of course, it's a boost for us when he comes back.</p>
      <p>"He's stepping up his recovery and let's see how soon he'll be match-fit and available.</p>
      <p>"Sunday? No. Spurs? I can't say because I've not been at home and seen him. Let's see where he's at when he comes back and starts training.</p>
      <p>"He's not really been able to play for us so when we get him back it'll be like a new world-class signing.</p>
      <p>"We want him back as soon as possible."</p>
