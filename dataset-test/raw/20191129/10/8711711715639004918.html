      <p>More 55,000 third country nationals - would-be asylum seekers and irregular migrants from dozens of countries - are now being hosted in shelters operated by Greece armed forces, according to an announcement on Friday by the general staff.</p>
      <p>The figure is higher by nearly 3,000 people from last Thursday, with most of the shelters on a handful of eastern <a href="https://www.naftemporiki.gr/k/aegean">Aegean </a>islands that have been the first destination of third country nationals smuggled onto or rescued in mid-sea after setting off from the opposite Turkish coast.</p>
