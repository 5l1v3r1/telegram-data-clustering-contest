      <p>Skipper Conor Coady hailed Wolves’ Europa League progress and revealed they have hit their target.</p>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo’s side reached the knockout stages with a game to spare despite blowing a two-goal lead during Thursday’s 3-3 draw in Braga.</p>
      <p>They are second in Group K ahead of the final game at home to Besiktas on December 12 and Coady admitted making the last 32 was their initial ambition.</p>
      <p>He told the club’s official site: “It’s huge. That was the goal when we set out in this competition, that’s what we wanted to do and we’ve done that.</p>
      <p>“We can look back on it, an absolutely amazing achievement, and where this club’s come from, it’s absolute night and day.</p>
      <p>“So, it’s a massive achievement, but it’s a little bit of a mad feeling because we felt we should have won the game and we need to look at it because it’s disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It feels something like a defeat, but we need to look at the achievement and look at where we’ve come from and that we’ve actually got out of the Europa League group stages.”</p>
      <p>Raul Jimenez, Matt Doherty and Adama Traore put Wolves 3-1 up in Portugal after Andre Horta’s deflected opener.</p>
      <p>But Paulinho and Fransergio levelled in the second half with Group K leaders Braga also qualifying. They travel to Slovan Bratislava in their final game a point ahead of Wolves.</p>
      <p>Coady added: “It’s an amazing competition, we want to play in it every year.</p>
      <p>“Every game you come into, every stadium you come into, you take every game as it comes and it’s amazing competition, and one that we’re learning from every single game.”</p>
