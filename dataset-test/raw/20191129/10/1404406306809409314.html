      <p>In this clip, DJ Vlad asked Tray Deee to define a culture vulture, and the West Coast entertainer explained that it's someone who exploits a culture for their own gain with no regard to the state of the culture. When asked to name specific people that he believes fits the definition, Tray Deee said that he couldn't think of a specific person.Â </p>
      <p>However, when asked about Ruthless Records co-founder Jerry Heller, Tray Deee explained why he doesn't think Heller was a culture vulture. Tray Deee stated that Heller was actually a fixer and problem solver for the label, adding that Heller was in a unique decision to be the industry brains behind Eazy-E's Ruthless Records.
