      <p>This marcher proved too tough to crack.<br/><br/>A balloon handler who tried to swoop in and get a handle on an out-of-control Nutcracker balloon during the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade">Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade</a> got knocked on her butt by the giant inflatable — but didn’t let it deflate her holiday spirit.</p>

      <p>That’s when the brave parade worker rushed the supersized balloon to help.<br/><br/>But she got whacked by the side of the inflatable’s white hair, and fell flat on her back.</p>
