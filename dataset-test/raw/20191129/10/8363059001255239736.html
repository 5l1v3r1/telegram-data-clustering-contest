      <p>The iPhone X may be a few years old by now, but it's an iPhone. That means it holds its value better than Spider-Man holds onto walls, because people just love to buy iPhones and Apple isn't fond of price drops when it doesn't need them. So it's nice to see a 25% discount hit Amazon for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>The deal covers the 64GB iPhone X in silver, and lowers the price <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076GV5GXF">from £899 to £639 </a>- saving you £260 from the normal price. A normal price which also happens to be £200 lower than the original retail price when it debuted in 2017.</p>
      <p>Of course if the iPhone isn't for you, but you still want an Apple product, you can still get your hands on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPad-10-5-Inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B072K6NQGM/ref=sr_1_5?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;keywords=ipad+pro&amp;qid=1574886205&amp;smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;sr=8-5&amp;ascsubtag=giz-1382671586731719175-21">a discounted iPad Pro,</a> and £150 off this <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B07XSGB1GD/ref=sr_1_6?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;keywords=ipad&amp;qid=1574884537&amp;smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;sr=8-6&amp;th=1&amp;ascsubtag=giz-1422255748665568166-21">year's 10.2-inch iPad</a>.</p>
