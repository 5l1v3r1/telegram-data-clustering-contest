      <h2>Arsenal have sacked manager Unai Emery after a woeful start to the season with the club languishing in eighth in the Premier League table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:10:01+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have sacked manager Unai Emery after the club's worst run of results since 1992.</p>
      <p>Emery replaced Arsene Wenger in the summer of 2018 but has lasted just 18 months with the Emirates board pulling the trigger.</p>
      <p>The Gunners were beaten 2-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday night, taking their winless run to seven matches and sealing Emery's fate.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> return to action in the Premier League against Norwich on Sunday, languishing in eighth in the table, eight points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>Emery insisted post-game on Thursday that his focus remained on the trip to Carrow Road.</p>

      <p>But senior figures met on Friday to discuss the crisis and concluded it was time for him to depart.</p>
      <p>A club statement declared: "We announce today that the decision has been taken to part company with our head coach Unai Emery and his coaching team.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the Arsenal board and our owners Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Josh Kroenke said: â€œOur most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand. We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success.</p>
      <p>"The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.</p>
      <p>"We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach. We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward.</p>
      <p>"The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans booed the team off for the second match in succession with the Frankfurt defeat following the home draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>Emery failed to convince supporters with Arsenal conceding a hatful of chances at their goal in recent matches.</p>
      <p>Their away form has again been woeful, with their only Premier League success on the road coming on the opening weekend at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> .</p>
      <p>The incident involving Granit Xhaka did not help matters with Emery failing to support his captain following his clash with supporters in the draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>

      <p>Emery instead stripped the midfielder of the captaincy and left him out of the picture, until giving him a recall for the defeat to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>His bizarre treatment of Mesut Ozil also raised eyebrows with Emery's failure to motivate his players evident in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The Europa League defeat was the final straw for the Arsenal board, having been a competition that has boosted Emery's reputation down the years, having won it three times while in charge of Sevilla.</p>
      <p>He did lead the Gunners to the final of the competition last season also, only to come unstuck against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in a final thrashing in Baku.</p>
      <p>But this season never really got going and after 22 years under Arsene Wenger, Arsenal are now looking for another manager, with Ljungberg set to lead the side at Carrow Road this weekend.</p>
