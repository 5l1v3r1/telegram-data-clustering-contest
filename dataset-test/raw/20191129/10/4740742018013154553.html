      <h1>Sainsbury's releases its new Christmas charity campaign, but it's not gone down well with shoppers</h1>
      <h2>Shoppers have expressed their cynicism towards the scheme</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:41:23+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:41</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Pugh, Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Sainsbury's have launched their 'Shop For Others' campaign - an initiative which aims to help those who are most vulnerable during Christmas.</p>
      <p>It encourages shoppers to donate non-perishable food items and toys in the boxes provided by supermarkets up and down the UK, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/sainsburys-slammed-shop-for-others-17318390">Manchester Evening News</a>.</p>
      <p>However, lots of Twitter users are cynical about the scheme and have expressed their views.</p>

      <p>"Nothing Irks me more than multi-million pound companies offering tips on helping others if you want to support donate some of your profits. If you as an individual want to help find a local charity &amp; donate your time. Don’t feed profits and let them pat themselves on the back," tweeted one frustrated shopper.</p>

      <p>Another added: "Here's a fun idea: instead of asking the already stretched-thin general public to spend more money at your store, multi-million hypermarkets could just GIVE food to charity! This is a transparent campaign for people to give you more money."</p>

      <p>"Could you please clarify if I am shopping for others in your store what are u contributing? Do u match my purchases?" questioned somebody else.</p>
      <p>"This is stupid a lot of people can barely feed themselves yet the million pound companies are asking for help why dont they help by making food more affordable  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShopForOthers?src=hashtag_click">#ShopForOthers</a> ," said yet another annoyed consumer.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Sainsbury's responded to the criticism, saying: "The ‘help brighten a million Christmases’ campaign builds on our food donation programme which runs year-round and encourages people to donate new toys and non-perishable food items from any store in the UK – not just Sainsbury’s or Argos.</p>
      <p>"We’ve made sure the donation bins are located at the front of all of our stores, so customers can easily pop in and drop off food or toys from elsewhere."</p>
