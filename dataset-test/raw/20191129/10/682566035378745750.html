      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> coach <b>Ernst Middendorp</b> says he is frustrated that the medical team gave the all clear for <b>Itumeleng Khune</b> to return to action.</p>
      <p>Middendorp stated last week that Khune wouldn't be available for selection ahead of the Telkom Knockout semi-final against Maritzburg United, which Chiefs went on to lose, but a day after the coach's statement Chiefs' media department contradicted him and declared the goalkeeper as fully fit.</p>
      <p>The German tactician has grown irritated by this and insists there is a big difference between being fully recovered from an injury and being fully fit to play.</p>
      <p>"Let me give you an example, I went for surgery - nobody knows; a knee operation. Okay, that was now last Tuesday - 14 days ago," said Middendorp, according to <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"Excellent work done; I had now, after two weeks, a final meeting with the specialist on Monday and he said, '100%, medically you're fit.'</p>
      <p>"But, he said, 'Now, be careful. Step by step, building it up. Don't turn around; don't kick the ball. Just be careful step by step.'</p>
      <p>"Medically I'm fit, but not in a way that I can run around and do stuff. This is the same thing that has happened with certain players.</p>
      <p>"I know, it's really something I'm not happy about [the club] pumping it into the public. Most of the time this 'medically fit' piece of expression is forgotten.</p>
      <p>"If you read it, 'the player is fit', but he's not - by far. He comes just out of a situation where he joined the training and put himself in a physically good condition to be competitive at a certain time, and in the moment he is not.</p>
      <p>"I don't see it coming now with a view to the next game, and that is the only thing I'm interested in."</p>
