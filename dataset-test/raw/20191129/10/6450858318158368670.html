      <p>The OnePlus 6T has been replaced by the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro - so now 6T availability is limited outside the US. However, if you know where to look you can still pick it up from certain places in the UK. Here, we share the best OnePlus 6T deals around, whether you plan to buy SIM-free or on contract.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, read our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oneplus-6t-3685825/">full OnePlus 6T review here,</a> grab one of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/mobile-phone/best-oneplus-6t-cases-3685902">best cases for the OnePlus 6T</a>, and check out the deals below.</p>
      <h3>OnePlus 6T price &amp; availability</h3>
      <p>The OnePlus 6T is no longer available directly from OnePlus but you can still find some models on Amazon if you want to buy SIM free. The phone initially cost £499/£529 in the UK - depending on how much RAM you opted for - but right now Amazon UK is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HH9ZD4Y?ascsubtag=06-3685837-11-0000000">6GB model for just £449</a> while the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HHG6CXS?ascsubtag=06-3685837-11-0000000">8GB version is £30 more</a>.</p>
      <p>The phone is a bit tricky to find in part because it's not the latest model any more. If you'd rather grab one of the more recent phones, then see our round up of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/mobile-phone/best-oneplus-7-pro-5g-deals-3696838">best OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro deals</a> or check out the even newer <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/oneplus-7t-3700351/">OnePlus 7T</a>. </p>
