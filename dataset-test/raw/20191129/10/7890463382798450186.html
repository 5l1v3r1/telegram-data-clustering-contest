      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2’s Online care package will give you wind</h1>

        <b>In a recent PC update <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61225/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-For-PC-Update">post</a> for <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, Rockstar said that players who have saddled up from the game’s launch through to the holidays will get a free care package to use in Red Dead Online. Now, the studio has <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61243/Red-Dead-Online-PC-Player-Care-Package">revealed</a> the goodies in store – and it includes a lot of baked beans. Yum.</b>
      </p>
      <p>First up, all RDR2 players on PC will get “the finely detailed Prieto Poncho” which you can grab for free in any of the game’s clothing stores, or find in the camp wardrobe. You can get a look at this below.</p>
      <p>But that’s not all – players also get a “curated care package,” kindly supplied by the game’s Wheeler, Rawson, and Co., which includes a handy bundle of ammo (revolver, pistol, repeater, rifle, and shotgun), arrows, throwables, some medicines for you and your good horse, plus some chow. That should be extra helpful now that a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/red-dead-redemption-2/update-framerate-fix">Red Dead Redemption 2 update has fixed the hungry Arthur issue</a> some players were experiencing.</p>
      <h3>What’s in the Red Dead Redemption online PC care package?</h3>
      <p>The Red Dead Redemption Online care package includes the following goodies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>100x Revolver Express Ammo</li>
        <li>100x Pistol Express Ammo</li>
        <li>100x Repeater Express Ammo</li>
        <li>100x Rifle Express Ammo</li>
        <li>100x Shotgun Slugs</li>
        <li>20x Shotgun Incendiary Buckshot Slugs</li>
        <li>20x Fire Arrows</li>
        <li>20x Poison Throwing Knives</li>
        <li>20x Volatile Fire Bottles</li>
        <li>10x Potent Miracle Tonic – fully restores Health, Stamina and Dead Eye and Fortifies moderately</li>
        <li>3x Horse Reviver – revives Horse from severe injury and moderately restores its Health</li>
        <li>10x Minty Big Game – fully restores all Cores and yields a Gold Health Core</li>
        <li>20x Baked Beans – moderately restores Health Core and Stamina Core</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rockstar says if you’ve already jumped into Red Dead Online and made your character you should have already got your care package, which you can grab at any of the game’s post offices or the lock box at your camp. If you’re yet to saddle up in Online, the package should arrive within 24 hours of creating your character.</p>
