      <h3>The SEA GAMES Federation Council Friday announced a new rule for the Philippine hosting of the 30th South East Asian Games which unfolds today at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</h3>
      <p>SEA Games Executive Committee chairman Celso Dayrit said that upon the initiative of SEA Games Federation and Philippine Olympic Committee president Abraham “Bambol” Tolentino, a bronze medal will be awarded even if there are only three countries entered in an event.</p>
      <p>“The current rule is, if for instance in boxing, only 3 countries are entered in a certain weight category, only a gold and a silver medal are to be awarded. The third placer gets nothing”, said Dayrit.</p>
      <p>Tolentino had emphasized that the Games are supposed to be “about the athletes. So why penalize an athlete who sacrifices, trains and participates, places third and is deprived of a medal because other countries withdrew at the last minute? That’s not his fault”.</p>
      <p>With support from all the member countries, the exemption from the current rule was sponsored by Prof.Charoen Watanasim of Thailand and approved unanimously.</p>
