      <p>After sustaining the issue during the early stages of Wednesday's Champions League fixture with Napoli, the Brazilian attempted to continue, only to pull out of his next challenge moments later.</p>
      <p>That ultimately led to his withdrawal, and manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> acknowledged after the match that the absence of the former Monaco man for a significant period would come as a big blow.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, medical staff at the Merseyside giants fear that Fabinho may be sidelined for between four to six weeks.</p>
      <p>While a scan is yet to take place, the report suggests that the general feeling is that the 26-year-old will not be available for the upcoming hectic schedule.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are due to play nine matches during December, which includes a trip to the Middle East for the Club World Cup.</p>
