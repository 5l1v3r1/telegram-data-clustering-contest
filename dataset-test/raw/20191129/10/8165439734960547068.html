      <h3>Here's what you missed</h3>
      <p>She's part of one of the most famous TV shows in the world, and Caitlyn continues to amaze the Campmates with tales from her life. She reflects on life in the spotlight, and the impact it's had on her family's life.</p>

      <p>The twist on the classic Bushtucker trial sees Roman, Jacqueline Jossa, Nadine Coyle and Ian Wright face a series of tests after Ant and Dec announced the camp is now ‘cursed’.</p>
      <p>Four Cursed Celebs, but just two places at the dinner table.</p>
      <p>It's a race against time - and water... roll up to the Sinister Circus.</p>

      <p>The Reckonings take an even more sinister turn when Adele, Cliff, James and Myles are buried alive. They're not in their chambers alone of course, and plenty of creatures arrive to keep them company while they wait for the key to drop that will free them from the Curse. Adele and Myles make light work of the challenge and unlock themselves first, leaving James and Cliff to go hungry.</p>

      <p>The Reckonings continue with Andrew, Andy, Caitlyn and Kate heading for the Bad Banquet. The Celebs soon lose their appetite as a feast of critters fall onto their faces - and it's Kate who struggles to stomach the gruesome challenge.</p>
