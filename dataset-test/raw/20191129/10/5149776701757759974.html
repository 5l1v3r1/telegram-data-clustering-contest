      <h1>Barber shop owner fined over £1,000 for dumping business waste in bin</h1>
      <h2>He had failed to listen to council inspectors</h2>

      <p>A barber shop owner in New Ollerton has been ordered to pay out more than £1,000 for using a domestic bin for commercial waste.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottingham Magistrates' Court</a> heard how Beaston Bakir Hashmi, from the Azar Turkish Barbers in Forest Road, admitted taking waste from the premises and placing it in the wheelie bin at a property at The Laurels, Sherwood Avenue in the town.</p>
      <p>Under the terms of the Environmental Protection Act, businesses must make provision for the disposal of waste from their premises.</p>
      <p>The court was told that a waste inspector from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Newark and Sherwood District Council</a> carried out a visit to the barber’s shop in January this year following reports of a build-up of trade waste at the rear of the property.</p>
      <p>Mr Hashmi told the inspector the waste was being left at the Sherwood Avenue address.</p>
      <p>He was advised this was unlawful and that he needed to obtain a waste contract as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The following month Mr Hashmi was sent a letter by the inspector setting out his responsibilities and ordering him to stop using the bin for commercial waste.</p>
      <p>By March 15, 2019, the inspector had received no further contact from Mr Hashmi and consequently was issued with a fixed penalty notice.</p>
      <p>The court further heard that Hashmi had failed to pay the fine.</p>
      <p>Appearing before magistrates on November 20, he pleaded guilty to failing to produce a waste transfer note and fined £300 and ordered to pay costs of £800 with an additional victim surcharge of £30.</p>
      <p>Councillor Roger Jackson, the council’s leisure and environment committee chairman, said: "This case demonstrates to businesses and residents the importance the council places on waste issues.</p>
      <p>"Failing to dispose of waste in a safe and legal manner can lead to environmental damage and places an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer.</p>
      <p>"In this instance the owner was given several chances to comply with the law but failed to do so.</p>
      <p>"He has learned to his expense that we will prosecute where necessary."</p>
