      <p>Cape Town - <b>Manchester United</b> manager <b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer </b>reckons there are many positives to take from his young team's defeat at <b>Astana </b>on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 6,000-mile round trip to face Astana is the furthest the Red Devils have ever travelled for a continental match, just as they have never had to contend with the kind of cold experienced around Nur-Sultan.</p>
      <p>It was far warmer inside the Astana Arena due to the roof under which United's young side started the Europa League tie brightly, with stand-in captain Jesse Lingard opening the scoring with a fizzing low finish.</p>
      <p>But already eliminated and previously pointless Astana grew into the Group L encounter, with Dmitri Shomko's strike and an own goal from United debutant Di'Shon Bernard sealing a surprise 2-1 win for the hosts.</p>
      <p>"Definitely (there are positives)," manager Solskjaer said.</p>
      <p>"Of course, we're disappointed with the end result but I thought we started the game fantastically, the boys took control of the game, scored a fantastic goal.</p>
      <p>"The response after they scored two was also good. Of course, I'm disappointed with that 10-minute spell, you could feel pressure was coming. We couldn't get on the ball as we did.</p>
      <p>"But some fantastic performances by the three young lads who made their debuts, all were excellent.</p>
      <p>"I think some of these (young players I brought to Kazakhstan) might benefit from going out on loan because they need men's football and today, they got the taste of it, some of them.</p>
      <p>"But some are also knocking on the door for us. You could see the way we dominated midfield. I thought Dylan (Levitt) and Jimmy (James Garner) playing together - it's nice to see midfielders dominating the game.</p>
      <p>"Di'Shon was so composed. Ethan (Laird), especially first-half, was marauding down the right-hand side, so some of these have done themselves a good favour."</p>
