      <p>A public toilet infamously used for prostitution and drug dealing is to be knocked down – to make way for a major town centre redevelopment.</p>
      <p>The conveniences at Locking Road car park, managed by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weston-super-mare">Weston</a> Town Council, will close to make way for new housing and major redevelopment of the town centre.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/local-news/town-centre-toilets-plagued-prostitutes-1627402">loos are a well known haunt for drug dealers and prostitutes</a> and over the years have fallen victim to vandal attacks, costing thousands of pounds in repairs.</p>
      <p>Weston Town Council took over the management of the loos several years ago after <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset-council">North Somerset Council</a> cut its funding of public conveniences to save cash.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset">North Somerset</a> Council – which is leading the town centre redevelopment – has given notice to the town council that it is terminating its lease on the loos.</p>

      <p>The toilets are expected to close next summer.</p>
      <p>Weston Town Council clerk Malcolm Nicholson said: “There have been ongoing issues with the toilets at Locking Road car park being used for prostitution and drug dealing.</p>
      <p>“However the town council wanted to keep them open due to the fact they are used by coach passengers arriving in the town.</p>
      <p>“We have now been advised by North Somerset Council that it wants to terminate its lease for the conveniences.</p>
      <p>“It is planned for them to close in July next year however this may be brought forward to April.”</p>
      <p>The town council manages five other public toilets in the town at Grove Park, Ashcombe Park, Clarence Park, Uphill Links Road and one in Worle High Street.</p>
      <p>It is also looking at the possibility of providing a replacement town centre toilet at the newly created bus hub at Alexandra Parade being planned as part of the redevelopment.</p>
      <p>Other public loos in the town have also encountered problems.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/local-news/cctv-could-installed-grove-park-2442328">toilets at Grove Park are also used by drug users</a> and had to be closed temporarily last year after hypodermic needles were found to be blocking up the drains.</p>
      <p>The block, which is fitted with underfloor heating, has also been used by people to sleep in overnight.</p>
      <p>The regeneration of the town centre includes building up to 400 new homes and shops and offices on Sunnyside Road and Locking Road car park.</p>
      <p>The plans form part of proposals to enchance the entrance to the town centre around the railway station.</p>
      <p>The scheme is being developed in partnership with Homes England which has already bought several key sites in the location.</p>
      <p>The developments are part of the Weston Town Centre Regeneration Programme that is delivering improvements to key development sites and positively encouraging investment within the town.</p>
