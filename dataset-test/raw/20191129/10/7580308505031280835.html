      <p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on Thursday he would like to see an African league created and investment of more than $1 billion (900 million euros) on stadia on the continent.</p>
      <p>“We have to take the 20 best African clubs and put them in an Africa league,” Infantino said during a visit to DR Congo to celebrate the 80th birthday of club TP Mazembe.</p>
      <p>“Such a league could make at least 200 million in revenue, which would put it among the top 10 in the world,” he added.</p>
      <p>Infantino added he planned to launch an appeal “to collect a billion dollars before being able to give every African country a real football stadium up to FIFA standards.”</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old who took over as head of world football’s governing body in February 2016 said his ideas were to help the sport in the continent compete on a global level.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take the best African referees and pay them. We will depoliticise it and professionalise African refereeing,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I want to take African football to the top of the world,” he added.</p>
