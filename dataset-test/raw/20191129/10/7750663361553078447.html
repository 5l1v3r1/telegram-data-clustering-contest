      <p>Jens Toornstra's deflected opener was the least <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dick-advocaat/"><b>Dick Advocaat</b></a>'s side deserved after dominating the first period in Rotterdam.</p>
      <p>But it was a different story after the break as two superb <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alfredo-morelos/"><b>Alfredo Morelos</b></a> headers fired Gers back into the crucial <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/europa-league/"><b>Europa League</b></a> contest.</p>
      <p>Luis Sinisterra's equaliser ensured the penultimate Group G clash ended in 2-2 draw but the Light Blues can clinch a place in the last 32 with a draw against Young Boys in two weeks' time.</p>
      <p>However, left-back Barisic admits they will need to put on a complete performance to ensure they see off their Swiss rivals after showing Feyenoord too much respect.</p>
      <p>The Croatia international said: "The result was good but the performance in the first half was not too good from us.</p>
      <p>"We didn't play like Rangers, we weren't aggressive enough, we didn't get close enough to their players, we didn't have enough players running forward.</p>
      <p>"We didn't deserve to be drawing at half-time – I think 1-0 was actually a good score for us as they had a couple of good chances to score more.</p>
      <p>"But in the second half we showed how we could really play, we showed our style.</p>
      <p>"At half-time, the manager told us we need to start playing like Rangers, to play all the time and I think we accepted that and the second half changed for the better.</p>
      <p>"I'm always confident. I think we play very good football, especially at home at Ibrox with our crowd of 50,000 people behind us.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy to play there but it's not just about the crowd. The performance is the most important thing.</p>
      <p>"We need to start well against Young Boys and take the crowd with us. But we have two weeks until that game and a lot of time to prepare."</p>
      <p>Morelos became the first Rangers player to score in four consecutive European games and Barisic – who teed up his second goal – is thrilled to be playing alongside the Colombian.</p>
      <p>He said: "Alfredo is a top player. You can see he can score from every position. With his head, with his left foot, with his right.</p>
      <p>"It's really nice to play with a player like Alfredo. It's very good to know that he will be here until the end of the season."</p>
