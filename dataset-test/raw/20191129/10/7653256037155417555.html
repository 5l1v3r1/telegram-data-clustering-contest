      <p>NEW DELHI: Amid opposition ruckus, BJP member <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Pragya-Thakur">Pragya Thakur</a> on Friday made a fresh statement in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha">Lok Sabha</a>, apologising for her remarks on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Nathuram-Godse">Nathuram Godse</a>, even as she asserted that she never described Mahatma Gandhi's assassin as a patriot.</p>
      <p>"I want to say only what I do for the country. On November 27, during discussion on SPG (Amendment) Bill, I did not call Nathuram Godse a patriot (desh bhakt), I did not even take his name. Still if someone is hurt, I express my regret and apologise," she said in Lok Sabha around 3.00 pm.</p>
      <p>Before she entered the House, Speaker Om Birla had said that Thakur would read out the statement agreed upon at the meeting of party leaders.</p>
      <p>Thakur started her remarks referring to her enemies, but she was interrupted by the Speaker. She then read out the fresh statement.</p>
      <p>The House then resumed normal business with members speaking on their Zero Hour references.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Thakur had made a statement on her remarks on Godse.</p>
