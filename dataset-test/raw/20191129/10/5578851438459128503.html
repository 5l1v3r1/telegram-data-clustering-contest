        <b>US President Trump on Thursday made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan where he celebrated the US holiday Thanksgiving with troops and met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to the media, Trump said that meetings with the Taliban had been reestablished.</p>
      <p>“The Taliban wants to make a deal and we are meeting with them,” Trump told reporters on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We say it has to be a ceasefire and they didn’t want to do a ceasefire and now they want to do a ceasefire, I believe. It will probably work out that way.”</p>
      <p>In response, Taliban leaders told Reuters that the group has been meeting with U.S. officials in Doha since last weekend, and they believe that formal peace talks could resume soon.</p>
      <p>Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said the group was “ready to restart the talks” that were scuttled in early September after a Taliban blast in Kabul killed twelve people, including an American, and Trump declared the process “dead.”</p>
      <p>Mujahid told Reuters: “Our stance is still the same. If peace talks start, it will be resumed from the stage where it had stopped.”</p>
      <p>“We are hoping that Trump’s visit to Afghanistan will prove that he is serious to start talks again. We don’t think he has not much of a choice,” said a senior Taliban commander to Reuters, on condition of anonymity.</p>
