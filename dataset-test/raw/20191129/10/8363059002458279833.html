      <h1>Firebox's Black Friday Deals Include a Big Black Box</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:20:47+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">Holly Brockwell</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday is in full swing and Firebox is offering a big black box of mysteries.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.firebox.com/The-Black-Box/p7397">Black Box</a> apparently contains over £130 worth of Firebox's bestselling products and costs £74.99, which is a saving of at least £55.01. It looks a bit NSFW with the censoring, but we assure you it's all above board:</p>

      <p>Firebox does a mystery box every year but this year's is apparently a doozy, with "all new, improved contents for 2019" (hmm, how can it be new AND improved? #pedantry) available for 24 hours only.</p>
      <p>The site's top 50 products page currently includes things like the <a href="https://www.firebox.com/Pennywise-Balloon-Lamp/p9188">Pennywise Balloon lamp</a>, a <a href="https://www.firebox.com/Ray-Gun-Nose-Trimmer/p7564">nose hair trimmer shaped like a ray-gun</a> and a <a href="https://www.firebox.com/Wacky-Waving-Inflatable-Tube-Guy/p8924">wacky waving inflatable tube guy</a>. Top ranking products also include the Black Box itself, which would be an interesting find inside your Black Box -- just boxes all the way down.</p>
      <p>There's also 20% off <a href="https://www.firebox.com/exclusive/t321">Firebox Exclusives</a> for Black Friday, which includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.firebox.com/CBD-Christmas-Pudding/p9335">CBD Christmas Pudding</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.firebox.com/Sloan-the-Sloth-Back-Massager/p9246">A Sloth Back Massager</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.firebox.com/This-Gin-Tastes-Like-Christmas/p9150">This Gin Tastes Like Christmas</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you've got your eye on one of those mysterious <a href="https://www.firebox.com/The-Black-Box/p7397">Black Boxes</a> though, you'd best be quick – they're apparently pretty limited, and only available for 24 hours. The 20% off exclusives is even quicker: it ends at midnight tonight (the 29th).</p>
      <p>However, there'll also be 15% off <i>everything </i>on the site starting midnight on Saturday (ie Sunday morning) for 24 hours.</p>
