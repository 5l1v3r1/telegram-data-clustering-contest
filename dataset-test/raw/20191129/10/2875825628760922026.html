      <h1>Odds on next permanent Arsenal manager as Unai Emery sacked</h1>
      <h2>The Spaniard was relieved of his duties on Friday following a dismal run of seven games without a win, with a number of high-profile candidates now linked with the role</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fredrik-ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> have been installed as joint favourites with bookmakers to take over permanently from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-latest-live-updates-20986271">sacked Unai Emery</a> at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/unai-emery">Emery</a> was dismissed from his managerial post at the Gunners less than 12 hours after the 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Gunners fans held up 'Emery Out' banners as their side failed to record a win for the seventh match in succession.</p>
      <p>A meeting was held on Friday between senior figures at Arsenal and decided to sack Emery, with Ljungberg replacing him on an initial interim basis.</p>
      <p>The Swede is priced at 6/4 to get the gig full-time, having made the step up to the first team from the under-23 squad this season.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> boss Santo is also 6/4 having led his team to a seventh-place finish in their first season back in the Premier League after promotion last year.</p>
      <p>He refused to comment on rumours linking him with the Arsenal role on Thursday, stating: "I think you know me well enough and you know that I’m not going to answer about that.</p>

      <p>“I will never mention an issue that’s not a reality. Mainly because the job has a manager in it. It would be disrespectful.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the list of candidates includes Man City assistant manager and former Gunners captain Mikel Arteta who is at 8/1.</p>
      <p>Arteta was interviewed for the job previously, as did Massimiliano Allegri (20/1) but both were pipped to the post by Emery.</p>

      <p>Axed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss Mauricio Pochettino is next at 10/1, although a move to Spurs' north London rivals seems unlikely, while Bournemouth's Eddie Howe is also in contention (10/1).</p>
      <p>Legendary Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira - currently boss of French side Nice - is at odds of 25/1, along with ex-Liverpool star Steven Gerrard, Lille boss Christophe Galthier, and Rafael Benitez.</p>
      <p>Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti - formerly of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> - is a rank outsider at 40/1.</p>
