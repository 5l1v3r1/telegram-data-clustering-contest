      <p>Creative Director, Richard Toy said: "We decided to take the concept of an illuminated garden trail up a level. What now defines us is the epic scale of our light shows which are set to a painstakingly crafted soundtrack. There is nowhere in the South of England that comes close to producing a night-time Christmas spectacular like our all-new experience Finding Wonderland.”</p>
      <p>Finding Wonderland is a new 25-minute show this year which invites you to believe in wonder and see for real an enchanting land of colour.</p>

      <p>He added: "We’ve spent about three months crafting Finding Wonderland. This one show alone requires thousands of lighting cues in choreography with the music. The show creates an emotionally powerful feeling and we really hope our visitors love what we’ve done this year as much as they did last year."</p>
      <p>Finding Wonderland also features stunning special effects including giant sparklers which shoot 15m in to the air and over 8,000 cubic feet of smoke is used in every performance to completely engulf the audience in seconds - so be prepared to be blown away.</p>

      <p>Visitors are left in awe when they enter Wonder Nights through a hidden door at the back of an old enchanted barn. Here, they step into Enchantia, a beautiful wooded grove adorned with Christmas sparkle and over 25,000 fairy lights.</p>
      <p>From here you are free to discover the park your own way. Walk through the South-West’s only fire garden and see a mirage of over 100 real flames shimmer across the Grand East Lawn. You can even toast your own Marshmallows in the fire pits.</p>

        <figcaption>There are four shows and four lightscapes to enjoy</figcaption>

      <p>Step into Another World and discover an illuminated nightscape featuring mass-scale laser technology and a mix of white, purple and turquoise colours that create the feeling of walking around a world beyond our own.</p>
      <p>Watch in wonder as an all-new feature, the Blue Beacons, utilises police-style lights that create a spinning, swirling effect across the lawns and through the trees which is bound to be truly mesmerising.</p>

      <p>You can also meet eccentric adventurer, Sir Piers, in the historic dining room of Mount Edgcumbe’s famous mansion and discover a journey through his stately home.</p>
      <p>You’ll discover beautifully-crafted interiors, intriguing works of art and a growing collection of travel treasures along the way.</p>

      <p>But it’s his newest acquisition that has a mysterious power that magically brings the Great Hall to colourful life. This might just seek the attention of a very special passing guest.</p>
      <p>How brave do you feel? Richard continues to say: “In our land, not all is wonderful... We dare you to walk beyond the magical delights of the formal gardens into a scarily thunderous valley!”</p>

      <p>The Vulnerable Edge is home to the estate’s more sinister goings-on. This light show is not for the faint-hearted so beware as you venture deep into the woods at night. A thunder storm is fast approaching and one thing’s for sure – you’re not alone!</p>
      <p>There is also plenty of options for festive food, including giant Bratwurst sausages and Belgian waffles plus a bar stocking ales, draft lager, mulled wine, spiced cider and hot chocolate.</p>

      <p>The best part is, this year, Wonder Nights is in aid of St. Luke’s Hospice Plymouth so you know a proportion of your entrance fee is also going towards a very important cause.</p>
      <p>Wonder Nights is open nightly between the following dates: December 12-15, 19-23, 27-30 and January 2-5.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The event opens at 4pm and closes after 9pm each night. It takes at least three hours to see everything once, so to make the most of your evening, it is suggested you arrive early as it’s likely you’ll want to enjoy some experiences more than once.</p>
