      <p>Qatar’s cruise season is moving ahead with full steam as yet another mega cruise ship docked at Doha Port yesterday. Qatar welcomed MSC Bellissima which arrived at the port with over 5,800 passengers on-board. It is MSC Bellissima’s, which is operated by global cruise line MSC Cruises, maiden call at Doha Port.</p>
      <p>“MSC Bellissima arrived on its maiden call to DohaPort with 5,817 passengers and crew on-board. Welcome to Qatar,” tweeted Mwani Qatar yesterday.</p>
      <p>The passengers of the ship were accorded a warm welcome on arrival at Doha Port. Arrival of this mega cruise ship reflects the growing popularity of Qatar among global cruise tourists.</p>
      <p>Costa Diadema, the fleet flagship of leading company Costa Cruises, docked at Doha Port for the first time on Wednesday morning. With a capacity of 4,974 passengers and over 1,200 crew members on board, Costa Diadema is the largest vessel flying an Italian flag. Its arrival marked the first of 16 turnaround calls that the Dream-class cruise liner will be making during the 2019-20 Season.</p>
      <p>The current cruise season, Qatar’s fourth and largest cruise tourism season, kicked-off in October with arrival of the megaship Mein Schiff 5, which carried 3,350 passengers. The ongoing cruise season is expected to be busier, with over 186,000 passengers and over 61,000 passenger and crew are expected to arrive on 74 ships.</p>
      <p>Five ships will make their maiden calls to Doha this season. In addition to the 16 turnaround calls, it is also the first season where 9 ships will be staying overnight at Doha Port, giving the passengers ample time to explore the destination’s offerings. 45 ships are making transit calls during this season.</p>
