        <b>The M65 has reopened after an overnight closure overran by four hours this morning (November 29).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The westbound M65 was shut overnight between junctions 4 (Darwen, A666) and junction 3 (Blackburn, A674) due to resurfacing works.</p>

      <p>Highways said the closure was due to be lifted by 6am, but due to "unforeseen circumstances", it remained closed until 10am.</p>
      <p>It has since confirmed that resurfacing works overran "partly because of a dip in temperatures".</p>
      <p>The lengthy closure forced commuters to be diverted during peak morning rush hour, causing delays of up to an hour.</p>
      <p>But at 10am, Highways confirmed that the M65 has fully reopened. But the agency is warning of 'residual delays' due to ongoing congestion between junctions 6 and 3.</p>
