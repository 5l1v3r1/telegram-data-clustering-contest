      <p>Steve Bruce has insisted Newcastle United do not need to panic in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Toon</a> head coach is believed to have been told there is money to spend in the next trading period in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> but has played down expectations as other clubs start to prepare for business.</p>
      <p>When asked about recruitment <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> said: "I have been in it long enough to know that sometimes you have to be a bit patient.</p>
      <p>"If you can't get what you want to add to the squad you can't just bring them in for the sake of it.</p>
      <p>"In January in my experience it is very, very difficult because if they don't want to sell their best player you won't get big change in January - especially if a team is doing well.</p>
      <p>"Or if they are at the other end of the table where you are fighting against relegation you don't want to lose your best players.</p>
      <p>"It is a difficult window but as I keep saying if there is something out there that can improve so we can do something then we will."</p>
