      <p>Standing on the right side of President Kenyatta, Shollei led the newly elected president through the oathing ceremony before ushering him in as the fourth president of the Republic of Kenya.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <i>Standard Media Group</i> in a past interview, the woman representative revealed that the ceremony was the biggest highlight of her career in the Judiciary. </p>
      <p>"Even though I was fired from the Judiciary, they will never take that feeling away from me," she intimated.</p>
      <p>Shollei's role in the swearing-in ceremony was in line with the requirements of the constitution, which calls for the Chief Registrar to spell out the oath for the incoming president and the deputy.</p>
      <p>"The oath or affirmation under subsection (1) shall be administered to the president-elect by the chief registrar before the chief justice, or, in the absence of the chief justice, the deputy chief justice, not earlier than 10.00 am and not later than 2.00 pm," part of the Assumption of The Office of the President Act 2012.</p>
      <p>It was after the oathing that the Chief Justice Willy Mutunga took over from Shollei and presided over the handing over the instruments of power to the new president.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto were sworn in by another woman, Ann Amadi, who is the current Chef Registrar of the Judiciary.</p>
