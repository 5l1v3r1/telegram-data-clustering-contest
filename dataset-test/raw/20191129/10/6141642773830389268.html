      <p>The artistic director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF) is stepping down from the role.</p>

      <p>Mr Adams said: “It’s been a real pleasure to work with the team in Edinburgh and help deliver the growth and development of EIFF over the last five festivals and to be instrumental in re-establishing its international profile.</p>
      <p>“I have decided it is time to move on and look to new and exciting opportunities.”</p>
      <p>Ken Hay, EIFF chief executive, said: “Mark has played an important role in developing EIFF over the last five years, introducing innovative programming and reaching new audiences.</p>
      <p>“We are sorry to see him go but are excited and ambitious for the future of EIFF.”</p>
      <p>Rod White, director of programming for the festival’s parent charity CMI, will work with the existing team to deliver the forthcoming festival in June 2020.</p>
      <p>Recruitment to replace Mr Adams as artistic director will start next year.</p>
