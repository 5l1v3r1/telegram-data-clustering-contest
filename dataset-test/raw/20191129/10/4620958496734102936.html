      <p>Tokyo is one of the most highly sought-after travel destinations in the world. However, return airfare from Vancouver isn’t exactly easy on the wallet.</p>
      <p>While most flights to the land of the rising sun typically cost well over $1000 return, United Airlines is offering a number of flights for under half of the regular price.</p>
      <p>For example, the flight below, which departs Vancouver on<b> Monday, Mar. 2</b> and returns on<b> Tuesday, Mar. 10</b>, costs a total of<b> $486.74 CAD</b> including all taxers and fees. To achieve this price, Bravofly has also discounted the airfare by $50.88 CAD.</p>
