      <h1>Report: Manuel Pellegrini has two games to save West Ham job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:15:18+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/dom-toner/" target="_blank">Dom Toner</a></address>
      <p>West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini reportedly has just two games to try save his job at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7736815/Manuel-Pellegrini-given-TWO-GAMES-save-job-West-Ham.html?__twitter_impression=true">According to the Daily Mail</a>, the Hammers manager is under real pressure right now and the club are on the search for potential replacements.</p>
      <p>It is understood that dropping into the bottom three of the Premier League table could be the “likely tipping point” that forces his dismissal.</p>
      <p>The report details that West Ham are “reluctant” to make a mid-season change of management, but may be forced into doing so depending on the next two results against Chelsea and Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Sean Dyche are named as three potential managers that the club may turn to if they axe Pellegrini.</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>West Ham have two extremely difficult fixtures on paper next and it would be no surprise if Pellegrini is shown the exit doors.</p>
      <p>They travel to Stamford Bridge on Saturday to face an exciting Chelsea outfit, while on Wednesday they travel to Molineux to battle Wolves.</p>
      <p>Chelsea and Wolves sit fourth and fifth respectively in the Premier table as it stands, while the Hammers sit 17th after a poor run in recent months.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini’s West Ham side simply haven’t been good enough given the quality in their team and they have now gone eight matches across all competitions without a win.</p>
