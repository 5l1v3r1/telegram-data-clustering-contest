      <h1>Kim Kardashian and her kids trek across mountains in Kanye West's Closed On Sunday video</h1>
      <h2>The Kardashian-West family have starring roles in the imaginative music video, with North screaming the 'Chick-fil-A' sign off and Kris Jenner riding a tank</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:47:49+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> 's music video Closed On Sunday has dropped on Thanksgiving and the star enlisted the help of his A-list family to create the imaginative masterpiece.</p>
      <p>The new music video for the track from the singer’s recent gospel album, Jesus is King, took the world by storm today after Kanye, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> , 39, and their kids North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm were spotted in the video.</p>
      <p>While the song has been made popular by its infamous Chick-fil-A reference, the music video is thought to be filmed on the sprawling Wyoming ranch that Kanye, 42, recently bought for $14 million.</p>
      <p>North West, six, stars alongside her extended Kardashian clan in the music video and is seen screaming the words Chick-fil-A' in Kayne's place, while the family huddle together on some rocks before trekking across barren land.</p>

      <p>The little girl takes after her father by blurting out the iconic phrase after the US chicken fast food chain agreed to stay shut one day a week following the founder's religious beliefs.</p>
      <p>It has since became famous for closing on Sundays and Thanksgiving Day, with the opening line in Kanye's track saying: "closed on Sunday, you’re my Chick-fil-A."</p>
      <p>The music video appears to be a total family affair with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kourtney-kardashian">Kourtney Kardashian</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kris-jenner">Kris Jenner</a> also making quirky appearances.</p>

      <p>Later, another group of people assemble and seem to worship the rapper in a cult-like fashion as he takes center-stage in the middle of a circle.</p>
