      <h2>The do-anything instrument might be easier to justify.</h2>

      <p>Here's a sweet deal on a gift that could make sense for the more adventurous music-makers in your life. Critter &amp; Guitari is running a sale on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/08/critter-and-guitari-organelle-music-computer-review-jack-of-all-trades/">Organelle M</a> that drops the price from $595 to <a href="https://www.critterandguitari.com/blog/holiday-sale-now">$499</a> from now through December 2nd. At that price, the music computer may be hard to resist -- it's a do-it-all instrument that can stand in as a synth, sampler, sequencer, drum machine or virtually anything else if you have the right code.</p>
      <p>We found that the Organelle requires patience and a curious mind, but that effort can pay off in spades. You can produce effects that would normally require multiple (and frequently expensive) devices to achieve -- you don't even need headphones or a mic if you're willing to use the built-in hardware. It can also run on AA batteries, so you can play wherever inspiration strikes. Add an active community building patches and it could easily keep daring musicians busy for a long time.</p>
