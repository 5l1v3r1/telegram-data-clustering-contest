      <p>E-Type meets I-Pace? You wish.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/26/jaguar-halts-electric-e-type-zero/"><i>Electrek</i></a>, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> is halting its plans to convert E-Types to electric propulsion to create the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/581938/jaguar-e-type-zero-electric-car-revealed/">E-Type Zero</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Electrek</i> obtained a copy of the letter Jaguar Land Rover Classic sent customers who expressed interest in the electrified E.</p>
      <p>It reads, “I am contacting you as you were one of the first to express interest in the all-electric Jaguar E-type Zero. It is with regret that I inform you that we have taken a difficult decision to pause the development of the production vehicle for the time being.”</p>
      <p>No explanation has been given as to why development has been paused and if or when Jaguar Land Rover Classic will hit the play button.</p>

      <p>The idea of the E-Type Zero was a refreshingly different one. Unlike <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/796670/aston-martin-db4-gt-zagato-review/">Aston Martin</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/791568/bentley-blower-continuation-series-revealed/">Bentley’s</a> from-scratch heritage replicas or <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/809590/2021-morris-je-unveiled/">Morris’s</a> EV homage to another classic Brit, Jaguar’s E-Type Zero was to be an electric resto-mod.</p>
      <p>Buyers could either provide their own donor vehicle for powertrain conversion or let Jaguar Classic source a donor car to be rebuilt. The BYO price was quoted as £60,000 (A$114,274).</p>
      <p>The E-Type Zero swapped out the original straight-six engine from under the bonnet and replaced it with a 40kWh battery pack, good for <b>220kW</b> and a 0-100km/h time of 5.5 seconds. Behind that, where the E-Type’s transmission sat, engineers installed the electric motor and reduction gear transmission.</p>

      <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the weight of all the electric hardware was virtually the same as that of the old engine. Total weight of the E-Type Zero was 46kg lighter than the original E-Type with few other changes made to the car beyond a modernised interior with a touchscreen.</p>
      <p>Real world range was said to be 270km, though the E-Type Zero didn’t support fast charging as that would've required additional components and weight.</p>

      <p>First revealed in 2017, an E-Type Zero was also used at the wedding of Prince Harry and the new Duchess of Sussex. Our Mike Duff enjoyed a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/683640/2018-jaguar-e-type-zero-review-retro-electro/">brief, chaperoned drive</a> of one last year, calling it an “impressively well-engineered thing”.</p>
      <p>Alas, it appears the project has been scuttled, leaving Mike and Prince Harry as part of a very exclusive group of people who’ve had the chance to drive an E-Type Zero.</p>
