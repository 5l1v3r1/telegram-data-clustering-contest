      <p>KT Tunstall is set to perform at a string of Lidl stores in Scotland to celebrate the supermarket's 100th store opening.</p>
      <p>The singer, 44, will perform for charity as part of the week-long 'Lidl Live' tour at a mixture of stores, local school and the firm's suppliers.</p>
      <p>The Suddenly I See star will head to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> , Ayr and Highland town, Strathpeffer, before the grand finale in Edinburgh on Burn's Night.</p>
      <p>She will also be there to officially open the 100 store on January 25 in a secret location soon to be announced.</p>
      <p>Alongside churning out her hits, KT will host backstage cooking shows while raising cash for children's charities.</p>
      <p>KT said: "I’m delighted to be teaming up with Lidl for a very Scottish week of music, food and fun.</p>
      <p>"There is a powerful place where our mutual interests meet; supporting local suppliers, looking after the environment, and raising important funds for children’s charities in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“When I decided to start cooking for myself on tour, it turned into ‘KT’s Kitchen’ - a mad-dash online cooking show with friends where I prepare very simple, quick, healthy and delicious food backstage.</p>

      <p>She is also set to join 80’s legend Rick Astley’s UK tour in 2020.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the exclusive charity gigs will go on sale on  <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lidl-live-with-kt-tunstall-tickets-83624257405">Eventbrite</a>  at 9am this Saturday (30 November) for a charitable donation of £7.50 (plus a £1.18 booking fee).</p>
      <p>The full ticket price, as well as profits from the sale of drinks at the events, will be donated to STV Children’s Appeal, which helps children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Ross Millar, Regional Director for Lidl in Scotland said: “We are proud to serve Scottish communities and champion the quality produce of our regional suppliers and we can think of no better way to celebrate our 100store in Scotland than with an exciting foodie-themed tour of the country with national treasure, KT Tunstall.”</p>
