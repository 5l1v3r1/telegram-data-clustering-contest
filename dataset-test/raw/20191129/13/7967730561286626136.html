      <p>Kids under 10, says portrait photographer Nicholas Fiennes, are "a nightmare".</p>
      <p>But contrary to their reputation for truculence, teenagers are a dream to photograph.</p>

      <p>"I really enjoy working with teenagers. As an age group they’re fascinating," he says.</p>
      <p>"When I can get them to relax in front of the camera and be who they really are, and their parents see that, it’s a wonderful feeling."</p>
      <p>Fiennes has three teenage daughters of his own (plus a 10-year-old son) and when his eldest daughter was given a leadership role in her final year at Pymble Ladies College, he got to know some of the other student leaders at her school.</p>
      <p>"I was just blown away by them," he says.</p>

      <p>"They have got this wonderful intelligence and hope and vision and their aspirations for life have not been tainted."</p>
      <p>After talking with them, the Pymble-based photographer came up with the idea of photographing student leaders from various high schools for what became his "Young Leaders of 2020" exhibition.</p>

      <p>Fifteen, 16 and 17-year-olds were photographed for the project. They were also videoed while sharing their observations of contemporary Australia, and their own aspirations.</p>
      <p>The teenagers' major concerns included climate change, equality, mental health and racism. The young people were inspired by athletes, wanted to travel and experience other cultures, and they wanted to "make a difference".</p>
      <p>The school children came from government and non-government schools including Cheltenham Girls’ High School, Scots College, The Forest High School and Our Lady of Mercy College, Parramatta.</p>
      <p>They had some blunt talk for our politicians. "If I could speak to the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, I would say stop focusing on what the rest of the world is doing and start focusing on what Australia needs," says 17-year-old Ethan Cheung of Scots College.</p>
      <p>Josie Connelly, 16, of Our Lady of Mercy College says: "If I could ask our Prime Minister anything - with so much scientific knowledge and so much pressure from everyone to just think about climate change, why are you in denial and why are you not doing anything?"</p>
      <p>Ori Lewin, 16, of Masada College, called out anti-semitism and 17-year-old Shafayet Chowdhury, captain of Hunters Hill High School, spoke about being bullied for being a Muslim.</p>

      <p>Ryde Secondary College school captain Alice Morgan, 17, believes federal cabinet should include a Minister for Youth. "I know we have a lot of problems with getting youth more involved and interested in politics these days," she says.</p>
      <p>Eloise Aiken, 17, Cheltenham Girls High school captain, is vocal on the cause of First Australians living in disadvantage. "It's concerning to see we are a developed country and we have people who don’t have access to basic human rights," she says.</p>
      <p>Fiennes hopes his photographs will encourage adults to take notice of the adolescents around them.</p>
      <p>"There is a tendency by older adults to discount what teenagers say because we think they’re naive and haven’t experienced life," he says.</p>
      <p>"What I have come to realise is not having that restriction gives you the ability to dream and you see possibilities everywhere."</p>
