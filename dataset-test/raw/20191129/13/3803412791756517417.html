      <p>With the former, you can double up various devices on a device-by-device basis, including iMac + MacBook Pro, MacBook + MacBook, and Mac mini + MacBook. These combinations are in addition to the iPad + Mac option. Headless Mode lets you use your Mac or iPad as the main display for a Mac Mini and Mac Pro.</p>
