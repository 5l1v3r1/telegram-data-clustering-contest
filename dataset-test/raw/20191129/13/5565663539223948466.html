      <p>Former World Vision  Zimbabwe security guards retrenched in 2011 without terminal benefits are planning to engage President Emmerson Mnangagwa for him to resolve the stand off between them and their former employer.<br/><br/>They said it appears their employer is reluctant to resolve the dispute considering the years that have gone by without any sign of progress in the matter.<br/><br/>Leader of the affected former workers Themba Chunda said the Zimbabwe Anti Corruption Commission (Zacc) has been upraised over the matter amid concerns that corruption might be the reason for the delays.<br/><br/>"240 of us were employed as security guards all over the country and were dismissed in 2011  reason being that company had no money," he said.<br/><br/>"What baffles us is that they have engaged another security company which is more expensive that if they were paying us."  <br/><br/>He said termination of their contract was unfair and need to be revisited.<br/><br/>World vision Communications officer, Andrew Shamu refused to talk saying the matter is in court.</p>
