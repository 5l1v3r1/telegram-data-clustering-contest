      <h1>Bahau's unique Rahmania Mosque still stands tall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:30:25+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Abnor Hamizam Abd Manap</a></address>
      <p>JEMPOL: The town of Bahau may have bade farewell to its former reputation as a ‘cowboy town’, having enjoyed an industrial and property boom in recent years.</p>
      <p>However, the former rubber, oil palm and timber hub still holds on to pieces of its history, in particular the 88-year-old Rahmania Mosque, located in Bandar Bahau.</p>
      <p>The mosque holds special significance as its <i>khutbah Jumaat </i>(Friday sermons) are delivered in both Tamil and Bahasa Melayu.</p>
      <p>It dates back to the 1930s when Nagoor Meera, an Indian-Muslim merchant from India, arrived in Bahau to open his grocery business.</p>
      <p>At the time, Bahau, which had a mostly Chinese community, did not have a mosque for the Muslim community, which prompted Nagoor to build one.</p>
      <p>Rahmania Mosque secretary Ustaz Umar Bawa, 52, said Nagoor began building the mosque in 1931 and used his own money to hire workers.</p>
      <p>The mosque, located in the vicinity of the Kampung Indah Muslim cemetery, measures a modest 48 square metres end to end.</p>
      <p>It can accommodate a maximum of 150 people.</p>
      <p>Its walls, floors and ceiling were built using wood gathered from forests near Bahau. It was then known as Masjid India Bahau (Bahau Indian Mosque).</p>

      <p>“It was the only mosque in Bahau at the time and it became the gathering point for the Muslim community to perform their prayers,” said Umar.</p>
      <p>He added that once the mosque was completed, Nagoor got a few imam from India to manage it.</p>
      <p>“That is why to this day, the <i>khutbah Jumaat</i> is delivered in both Tamil and Bahasa Melayu,” he said.</p>
      <p>In 1951, the mosque had to be relocated as some felt that its location within the grounds of the Kampung Indah Muslim cemetery wasn’t appropriate.</p>
      <p>However, it was moved merely several hundred metres down the road, rebuilt to the exact same specifications and has remained so to this day.</p>
      <p>Nagoor was believed to have died in India.</p>
      <p>Umar said in 1994, Nagoor’s son handed over the management of the mosque to the Bahau Muslim community, and its name was subsequently changed to the Rahmania Mosque.</p>
      <p>Umar added that the mosque’s management had never met any of Nagoor’s heirs.</p>
      <p>They were told that his son had also died in India.</p>
      <p>“As such, much of the history of the mosque cannot be archived. What’s left is a document relating to the construction of the mosque, as well as its floor plans,” he said.</p>
      <p>The mosque’s management, however, has upheld the practice introduced by Nagoor by employing an imam from India who is assisted by two local imam.</p>
      <p>The passing of time, said Umar, had not been kind to the mosque’s exterior and interior. Its walls, floors and ceilings are worn out.</p>
      <p>Umar added that the mosque’s management had since launched a fund to build a new mosque, which was estimated to cost RM5 million.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to demolish the original structure, but the deteriorating conditions have forced us to build a new mosque, which will be more convenient for the congregation.”</p>
      <p>Umar said the Rahmania Mosque had become a symbol of unity for the township, as it was used not just by the Indian-Muslim community but also the Malays.</p>
