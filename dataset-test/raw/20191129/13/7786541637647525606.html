      <p>"A boat came along and went right over them. When they pulled him out of the water, he didn't have an arm," Samantha Marulli, of Palm Beach, told the television station. "The fireman used a paddleboard to go out with a bag to get the arm," Marulli said.</p>
      <p>The crew of a 45-foot U.S. Coast Guard vessel assisted in turning the severed limb over to onshore first responders, the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-ne-palm-beach-diver-loses-arm-boating-accident-20191129-siglbj2upzhm5ikntgfub243hq-story.html">Sun-Sentinel</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jason Neiman told <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/palm-beach/diver-loses-an-arm-in-accident-with-boat-off-palm-beach">WPTV</a>, "The Coast Guard received a report that a Good Samaritan had located a severed arm. A Coast Guard member transferred it to the boat crew and it was transferred to the shore."</p>
      <p>The diver was taken to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries, the television station reported.</p>
