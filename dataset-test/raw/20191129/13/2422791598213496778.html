      <p>Disney has granted a dying "Stars Wars" fan's wish to watch the new movie in the franchise, "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," with his young son ahead of its release date, after responding to an appeal from the hospice where he is being treated.</p>
      <p>Rowans Hospice in Hampshire, England, <a href="https://twitter.com/RowansHospice/status/1199252389007708160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1199252389007708160&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2019%2F11%2F29%2Fentertainment%2Fdying-star-wars-fan-preview-scli-intl-gbr%2Findex.html">took to Twitter on Tuesday</a> to make the plea on behalf of one of its patients, saying "time is not on his side" for mid-December, when the movie is scheduled to be released in the U.K.</p>
      <p>The appeal met with strong support on social media, with the likes of Mark Hamill -- Luke Skywalker himself -- <a href="https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/1199417826169122817">wishing the hospice "good luck" with its request</a>.</p>
      <p>Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertIger/status/1200104229018439681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1200104229018439681&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2019%2F11%2F29%2Fentertainment%2Fdying-star-wars-fan-preview-scli-intl-gbr%2Findex.html">tweeted on Thursday</a> that the company would allow the patient a preview: "On this Thanksgiving, we at @Disney are grateful to be able to share #TheRiseOfSkywalker with a patient and his family @RowansHospice. May the force be with you and with us all!"</p>
      <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/117Ut4tm18w3DA0wZJzlo4DDx0dc7zzJi/view">In a statement from Rowans Hospice</a>, Lisa Davies, the health care support worker who passed the patient's wish on to other staff members, said she was "utterly speechless."</p>
      <p>Thanking Disney for its help, she said: "We totally appreciate that they have had to move mountains to make this happen!"</p>
      <p>"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," which is due to be released on December 19 in the U.K. and December 20 in the U.S., will be the final installment of the nine-part saga.</p>
