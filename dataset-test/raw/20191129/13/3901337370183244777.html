      <p>SuperSport United have a chance to close the gap on Kaizer Chiefs this weekend with the Glamour Boys not in action, but they have been dealt a blow for their game.</p>

      <p>Jamie Webber may be only 21-years-old, but the young midfielder has played in all but three of Matsatsantsa’s 12 Absa Premiership games so far in 2019/20, getting one goal and two assists along the way.</p>
      <p>The midfielder, however, was handed his fourth yellow card of the season in the 2-0 win over Maritzburg United, meaning that he will have to sit out the clash with Stellenbosch as they seek to leapfrog Mamelodi Sundowns into second place.</p>
      <p>While Bradley Grobler (flu), Evans Rusike and Thabo Qalinge (both injury) were missing for the win over Maritzburg, the only player definitely out for SuperSport going into their tie against Stellies is the suspended Webber – the others will be assessed before the game.</p>

      <p>SuperSport host Stellies at 20h15 tomorrow night, with Teboho Mokoena likely to come in for Webber following his return from South Africa’s successful campaign to reach the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the U23 African Cup of Nations. </p>
