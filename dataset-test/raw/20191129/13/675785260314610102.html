      <h2>I'm A Celebrity hosts Ant and Dec are convinced Cliff Parisi will be voted out on Friday night - but Alison Hammond worries there will be a surprise exit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:20:46+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Kyle O'Sullivan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kyle-osullivan/</a></address>
      <p>It feels like I'm A Celebrity has only just begun - but the first contestant will leave the jungle tonight.</p>
      <p>The celebs have been competing for immunity during the 'Reckoning' trials other the last few days.</p>
      <p>Those that fail to do so will be up for the public vote to decide who will get that unwanted wooden spoon.</p>
      <p>Their friends and family have been piling into the famous Versace Hotel and enjoying the facilities while their loved ones struggle on beans and rice.</p>
      <p>No one wants to be the first to go - and there are serious concerns that Caitlyn Jenner may leave in a shock exit.</p>

      <p>Speaking on today's This Morning, Alison Hammond pleaded with viewers to vote to save Caitlyn even though she is a firm favourite to win the series.</p>
      <p>Alison is concerned because Deal Or No Deal star Noel Edmonds was the surprise first casualty last year.</p>
      <p>She said: "Last year the surprise was Noel. No one thought he would leave. If you donâ€™t vote for your favourite you could lose Caitlyn."</p>

      <p>At the moment, Radio DJ Adele Roberts and comedian Andrew Maxwell are the bookies' favourites to be given the chop.</p>
      <p>They are closely followed by former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi, which Alison believes is because he "sleeps all the time".</p>
      <p>Presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly confirmed who they think will be first to leave on Thursday night's Extra Camp.</p>

      <p>When asked by Joel Dommett who they think will be the first to go - both Ant and Dec said that Cliff could find himself struggling to stay.</p>
      <p>Ant said: "I think it is fair to say that Cliff is in danger as he's not doing a lot."</p>
      <p>In agreement, Dec added: "I think he is struggling a bit and his energy levels have dropped and he's not been in the show a huge amount."</p>
