      <h1>QUT launches new $7.5m Centre for Data Science</h1>
      <h2>Projects already underway with Qld govt.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/matt-johnston-1224521" target="_blank">Matt Johnston</a></address>
      <p>The Queensland University of Technology has launched a new Centre for Data Science to enhance its faculties’ data-based research and advance its work with the state government and United Nations.</p>
      <p>Led by distinguished professor of statistics, Kerrie Mengersen, the centre will initially set up a network at the university to support data-led led decisions across key areas like health, environment, business, government and society.</p>
      <p>It will also form the lead node of a new Australian Data Science Network, bringing together data science organisations from across the country.</p>
      <p>While the centre only officially launched on Friday following the inaugural Data Science and Social Good symposium, Mengersen said a number of flagship projects are already underway.</p>
      <p>“At the top of that list is a first of its kind study into Queen’s Wharf Brisbane (QWB), a $3.6 billion integrated resort development in the Brisbane CBD,” Mengersen said.</p>
      <p>The QWB development will contain hotel and residential accommodation, a casino, retail and entertainment areas, and a new public space.</p>
      <p>A longitudinal benefits and impacts study (LBIS), jointly initiated by QUT and the Queensland government, is monitoring the social and economic effects of the QWB development from the outset.</p>
      <p>“The intention is to record these outcomes over a significant time span, allowing decision makers to proactively plan, coordinate, manage and improve the development,” she said.</p>
      <p>Key areas of the study include connectivity, safety, public sentiment, finance and construction, and tourism and business returns - forming the basis of an analytical framework which could be readily applied to other significant multi-purpose developments.</p>
      <p>“The study is a unique and critical strategic framework for evidence-based monitoring and decision-making that can be applied where any large-scale infrastructure projects are being considered,” Mengersen said, adding that this is just one example of the work expected to be carried out at the centre.</p>
      <p>“Our vision is to be a national and global leader in the development of frontier methods for the purposeful application of data to make a sustained societal impact.”</p>
      <p>Some of those projects, which are still in development, include an initiative with the United Nations to help countries use satellite data for agricultural development, and the Australian Cancer Atlas - an interactive, online atlas showing how the burden of cancer varies across small geographical areas for the whole country.</p>
