      <p>The Bears overcame a late deficit — and the inconsistency of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky — en route to a 24-20 win in Detroit over the Lions.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Trubisky had three touchdown passes on the day, including a late strike with just over two minutes left to David Montgomery that gave Chicago (6-6) the lead for good. Still, tt was a mixed-bag day for Trubisky, who head-scratchingly <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/bears-mitchell-trubisky-forgets-football-avoids-first-down/1x0yra6wquadk1vj9pxdvxqilm">avoided a first down</a> on a run late in the second quarter and threw a bad interception. He put up 338 yards on 29-of-38 passing.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It was a good showing for Lions rookie QB David Blough, who started in place of injured backup Jeff Driskel (starter Matthew Stafford was also out injured). Blough performed well in his NFL debut vs. a stout Bears defense, but it just wasn't enough. Blough finished with 22-for-38 passing for 280 yards, two touchdowns and a game-ending interception as Detroit fell to 3-8-1.</p>

      <p><b>2:10 p.m. END OF HALF: </b> Lions take a 17-7 lead into the locker room in a game that's had its ups and downs. Lions get ball to start the second.</p>

      <p><b>12:23 p.m.: </b>Good news: Jeff Driskel is active, but not starting. Whether that qualifies as good news is debatable.</p>
