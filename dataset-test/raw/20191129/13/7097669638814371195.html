      <h1>In a blow to diplomatic relations with Cuba, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Oct. 3 <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/10/274570.htm">ejected 15 Cuban diplomats</a> from the United States. The expulsion follows his <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/09/274514.htm">withdrawal of most U.S. personnel</a> from the embassy in Havana after 22 American diplomats and family members there suffered unexplained health problems.</h1>

      <p>Last November, some U.S. personnel in Havana began experiencing a range of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/some-u-s-diplomats-in-cuba-diagnosed-with-serious-health-conditions-medical-records-show/">symptoms</a>, including hearing impairment, nausea, dizziness and mild cognitive impairment. The people affected first and most severely were <a href="https://www.apnews.com/d0fa8db258bf4c5492428e448e953102">intelligence officers</a>, but later victims held a variety of positions in the U.S. Embassy. Several Canadian diplomats were also affected.</p>
      <p>The United States informed the Cuban government of these incidents on Feb. 17, 2017. Four days later, Cuban President <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-cuba-sonic-attacks-20170915-story.html">Raúl Castro</a> met with then U.S. Charge d’Affaires Jeffrey DeLaurentis and, pledging full cooperation, invited the FBI to investigate.</p>
      <p>So far, though, the investigation has been <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/cuba-embassy/541548/">unable to determine the perpetrator or motive</a> behind the mysterious attacks. Nearly a year after the first incidents, nobody even knows how the attacks were carried out. U.S. officials initially blamed some sort of sophisticated sonic weapon, but <a href="http://www.snopes.com/do-sonic-weapons-explain-the-health-diplomats-cuba/">scientists have questioned</a> whether sound waves alone could have produced the reported symptoms.</p>
