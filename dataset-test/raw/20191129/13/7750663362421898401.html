      <h1>How Atletico Madrid could line up against Barcelona</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atletico-madrid/"><b>Atletico Madrid</b></a>'s pursuit of their first La Liga win over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> since 2010 will continue on Sunday night when they welcome the Spanish champions to the Wanda Metropolitano.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-simeone/"><b>Diego Simeone</b></a>'s side will enter the match off the back of a 1-0 loss to Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday night, while they were held to a 1-1 draw at Granada in the league last weekend.</p>
      <p>Atletico have actually shared the points in seven of their 14 La Liga outings this season, although they are fourth in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/la-liga/table.html">the table</a>, just three points off leaders Barca.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how the home side could line up in the capital.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stefan-savic/"><b>Stefan Savic</b></a> (muscle), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-costa/"><b>Diego Costa</b></a> (neck), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sime-vrsaljko/"><b>Sime Vrsaljko</b></a> (knee)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-gimenez/"><b>Jose Gimenez</b></a> (thigh)</p>
      <p>Atletico will again be without the services of key central defender Stefan Savic due to a thigh problem, while experienced striker Diego Costa is out until at least February after undergoing a neck operation.</p>
      <p>Sime Vrsaljko is also unavailable as he battles to recover from knee surgery, but Jose Gimenez was pictured in training earlier this week ahead of the clash with Barca.</p>
      <p>That said, the 24-year-old has not featured since October 22 and is therefore unlikely to be thrown in this weekend, meaning that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mario-hermoso/"><b>Mario Hermoso</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/felipe/"><b>Felipe</b></a> should continue at the heart of the defence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/saul-niguez/"><b>Saul Niguez</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thomas-partey/"><b>Thomas Partey</b></a> were both suspended for the clash with Granada last weekend but are now available, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joao-felix/"><b>Joao Felix</b></a> stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury by appearing against Juve.</p>
      <p>As a result, the big-money summer arrival is expected to be given the nod alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alvaro-morata/"><b>Alvaro Morata</b></a> in the final third, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/angel-correa/"><b>Angel Correa</b></a> also being tipped to start in a wide position.</p>
