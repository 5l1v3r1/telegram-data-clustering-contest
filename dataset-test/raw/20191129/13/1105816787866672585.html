      <p>Springboks and bongos are species of antelope.</p>
      <p>A zebra and a giraffe escaped the flames and were secured by park officials, local newspaper the <i>Toledo Blade</i> said.</p>
      <p>In a statement posted on its Facebook page the park said it was “devastated by the loss of animals housed in a barn destroyed by fire… the loss of the wildlife that we care for every day is tragic for our team members who love these animals.”</p>
      <p>“The animals lost in this tragedy were part of our African Safari family, and the Park will be closed on Friday as we mourn their loss.”<br/>No humans were injured in the blaze, it said, adding an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the fire.</p>
