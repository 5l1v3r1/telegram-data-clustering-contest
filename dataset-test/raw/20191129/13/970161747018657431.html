      <p>Any parent will know that getting a picky child to take their medicine is no easy feat.</p>
      <p>So any sneaky tricks to help the healing along get a free pass.</p>
      <p>Rachael Begley came up with a pretty genius way to get her daughters to gulp down their medicine, using just sprinkles and some imagination.</p>
      <p>When Rachael’s daughters Anna, three, and Rosa, 16 months, were struck down with tonsilitis, Rachael struggled to give them the week-long course of ‘horrible-smelling’ antibiotic medicine they were prescribed to take four times a day.</p>
      <p>After unsuccessful attempts disguising the medicine in yoghurts and juice, Rachael, 27, spotted a jar of cake toppers she’d stashed in a cupboard.</p>
      <p>She tipped a load of the hundreds and thousands over the medicine to turn it into what she calls ‘unicorn potion’.</p>

      <p>Anna happens to <i>love </i>unicorns, so while she was initially suspicious she was quickly convinced to give it a go.</p>
      <p>After a cautious taste she declared the potion was ‘great’.</p>

      <p>Rachael shared the hack with her friends and then on her blog, Mummy Looks Funny, where it was flooded with comments from grateful parents.</p>
      <p>The post, which has received more than 23,000 likes, shares and comments, reads: ‘Parent hack of the century.</p>
      <p>‘My friend messaged me asking what it is that I do to get my kids to take medication if they are sick.</p>
      <p>‘So I told her. She was mind blown. This sh*t works. I’m talking ANY MEDICINE.</p>
      <p>‘Seeing as kids are germ infested and there’s a plethora of sickness going round at the minute I’ll share with you the hack that I dreamed up last year when I was at my wits end trying to get a tantruming toddler to get up off the floor and take a vile yellow antibiotic.</p>
      <p>‘What you do is: 1. Grab your stinky medicine that your kid has been flat out refusing to take. Measure the required dose and put it on a spoon.</p>
      <p>‘2. Grab some rainbow sprinkles. Dealers choice for the brand. I’m a high roller so we have Tesco own make.</p>
      <p>‘3. Sprinkle the sprinkles onto the spoonful of previously repulsive liquid.</p>
      <p>‘BAM! You now have yourself some delicious and magical unicorn potion.’</p>

      <p>Parents will need to make sure they sell the illusion, mind you. No kid will believe you’re giving them something magical if you offer up a half-hearted story about its powers.</p>

      <p>This is <i>unicorn potion</i>. Treat it with the respect and wonder it deserves.</p>
      <p>Rachael, from Belfast, said: ‘Last Christmas Anna and baby Rosa got really sick with bad tonsilitis.</p>
      <p>‘Both of them were so sick and were prescribed medicine to take – it smelled horrible.</p>
      <p>‘The baby was fine but because Anna was a bit older and in the terrible twos stage she just wouldn’t take it.</p>
      <p>‘She tried it once and was just like ‘no’, I felt really bad and was thinking ‘please just take it’.</p>
      <p>‘I was at my wit’s end and I opened the cupboard to get the syringe and the medicine.</p>
      <p>‘I saw the sprinkles and just thought ‘ooh this could be good’ – I was just so desperate and tired.</p>
      <p>‘I had it on the spoon and said ‘look it’s a unicorn potion, it’s great’.</p>
      <p>‘She was a wee bit unsure so I said ‘well if you don’t get it Rosa’s going to eat it all up’ so she ate it, it was such a relief.’</p>

      <p>Thankfully Rachael hasn’t needed to use the trick again, but says she now always makes sure to have sprinkles in her medicine cupboard.</p>
      <p>‘I’d tried everything so was really pleased and relieved when this worked,’ she said. ‘It was quick, easy and painless enough – it was great.</p>
      <p>‘Anna hasn’t needed another antibiotic since then but from now on I’m always going to have to make sure I’ve got hundreds and thousands in the medicine cupboard.</p>
      <p>‘When it comes to hundreds and thousands, the more the better.’</p>
