      <h1>Brahmachari Movie Review: Ninasam Sathish, Aditi Prabhudeva starrer is not short of entertainment quotient</h1>

      <p>Remember those old films of Kashinath? It was always a diffident protagonist, low on self-confidence when it comes to love, marriage and personal relationships. After Kashinath this genre of movies he single-handedly created had no successors, till now. Conservatives can continue to deride such films as sex comedies. But Brahmachari has the safety net of a U/A certificate, actors with an image acceptable to the family audience and decent production values for audience shy of such films. <br/><br/><br/>Ramu, our hero has vowed celibacy till marriage. Poor fellow finds himself in the sexual condition that comes from poor knowledge. Too sensitive and lacking control, he should have approached for answers from Dr Watsa. That would have been fun. The film however does not lack its own stock of sexpert jokes. There is no pretence of double entendre either. <br/><br/>In a film where the protagonist is the butt of most jokes, credit should go to Sathish for accepting to do it. He does his job of a soft-natured, mild-mannered good boy role quite well. Aditi Prabhudeva has the knack of getting into the skin of any character. The detailing given to the supporting characters is what makes them believable and gives the story a touch of reality. They are probably inspired from real characters and their mannerisms. <br/><br/><br/>Brahmachari is not a grand effort of a star vehicle. It depends heavily on the anecdotal comedy that is the staple of sex comedies. The story has been packaged well and is not short of the entertainment quotient. And of course there are the safety nets, in case you need them.</p>
