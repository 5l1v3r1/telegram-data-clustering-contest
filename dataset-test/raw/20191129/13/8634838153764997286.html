        <b><i>KTN News</i> show host Tony Gachoka on Friday, November 27 made public his intention to blow the whistle on Deputy President William Ruto on alleged accounts of corruption.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gachoka took to social media to make the accusations against DP Ruto in light of a proposal in the Building Bridges Initiative report which suggested that whistleblowers of corruption should get 5 per cent of recovered assets.</p>
      <p>"Promote whistleblowing by giving rewards of 5 per cent of recovered proceeds to persons who give information on corruption deals," the report reads.</p>

      <p>"Yes! I Tony Gachoka under this new law and in advance, want to report one DP William Ruto today the 27th day of November 2019 as being corrupt.</p>
      <p>"I am aware that if am right and he is culpable, I will be entitled to 5 per cent of all the recovered assets among them Weston Hotel, choppers and more," the <i>Pointblank </i>host posted on social media.</p>
      <p>DP Ruto has in the past been subject to questions pertaining to the source of his wealth. </p>
      <p>In a detailed post in 2011, the deputy president explained how he came to own the property associated with him.</p>
      <p>He was responding to questions about his ability to fund a presidential campaign. </p>
      <p>"Many have asked about my wealth and my source of funds to run a presidential campaign. This is not the first time being involved in a presidential campaign. In 2002 I was in Uhuru's and 2007 in tinga's (Raila's). For the record, I helped raise half the funds used in the 2007 campaign.</p>
      <p>"I sold chicken at a railway crossing near my home, I build my father a house using my university boom, paid fees for my siblings," he noted.</p>
      <p>"I have paid mortgage since 1996, sometimes two or three mortgages for whatever property I own. The records are available from the financial institutions and banks," Ruto disclosed.</p>
      <p>Ruto intimated that he then painstakingly bought shares in companies including some that he has built from scratch.</p>
