      <h1>You could be fined £100 for using a petrol station car wash</h1>
      <h2>Penalties have been issued</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:43:20+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Drivers have been warned that queueing up to use a car wash could slap you with a £100.</p>
      <p>A number of garages such as BP and Shell have recently installed CCTV cameras to catch drivers who stay at their sites for too long, according to PetrolPrices.com.</p>
      <p>The new rules mean drivers legitimately stopping to use the facilities have been hit with £100 penalties - issued by private parking firms, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/using-petrol-station-car-wash-3590976">Hull Live </a>reports.</p>
      <p>According to the site, there have been reports of penalties being dished out across the country in recent months.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.petrolprices.com/news/petrol-stations-are-the-latest-places-to-dish-out-pricey-parking-tickets/">PetrolPrices</a>' Lisa Board said: "A motorist using the Shell forecourt in Kilburn received a £100 demand from Euro Car Parks for staying longer than their 20-minute limit and, last week, a driver got a £100 demand after she exceeded the maximum stay at a Shell garage near me. In both cases, the delays arose from queuing for the on-site car washes.</p>
      <p>"Time limits are a problem at BP petrol stations, too. A recent recipient of one of these demands used the BP garage on Mitcham Road in Croydon, south London.</p>
      <p>"After paying for his fuel, the driver recalled queuing behind around six vehicles to use the car wash but later received a letter threatening debt recovery agents when he didn’t pay a £100 parking charge demand by MET Parking Services from him staying past the permitted 30 minutes limit."</p>
      <p>The site reports the story of another driver who queued for petrol, used an on-site shop then vaccuumed their car - and was hit with a £100 penalty.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for MET Parking Services told PetrolPrices: "We would encourage any motorist who believes they were issued with a charge notice incorrectly to appeal using our BPA [British Parking Association] audited appeals process. Motorists have the right to appeal to the independent appeals service, Popla [Parking on Private Land appeals], which is a free and easy to use service."</p>
      <p>Shell told <a href="https://www.petrolprices.com/news/petrol-stations-are-the-latest-places-to-dish-out-pricey-parking-tickets/">PetrolPrices</a> the parking restrictions were introduced to make the system fairer for everyone, and advises drivers to park in the correct bays rather than queue to avoid penalties.</p>
      <p>The rules state that signs must be clear, visible and simple to understand in order for penalties to be valid.</p>
