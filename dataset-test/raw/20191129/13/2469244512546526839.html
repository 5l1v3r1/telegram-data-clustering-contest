      <p>A security officer has described how he helped a man desperately trying to save his house from burning down with just a bucket of water following a spate of possible petrol bomb attacks in Exmouth last night.</p>
      <p>At least three vehicles were badly damaged following what police have confirmed was arson on Union Street at around 11.35pm.</p>
      <p>Owen Howlett was walking home from work when he heard a 'massive explosion', before coming across a number of burning vehicles.</p>

      <p>"I had literally just finished work and was heading home when I heard a massive explosion and saw a car was on fire," he said.</p>
      <p>"A poor chap was trying to put it out with a water bucket but it was so big it started melting his doorway and spread to another car.</p>
      <p>"I tried to help him but by then another fire had started down the road. It literally must have been about 30 seconds or a minute after I started helping him. It was 200m down the road.</p>
      <p>"Quite a few fire engines arrived - there must have been at least 15 firefighters on the scene - and two police cars as well."</p>

      <p>The Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they had to use breathing apparatus to combat the blazes.</p>
      <p>A statement said: "Firefighters from Exmouth Fire Station attended two separate vehicle fires within the above location (Union Street).</p>
      <p>"On arrival, crews confirmed that both vehicles were well alight. Crews used two hose reel jets and breathing apparatus sets to extinguish the fires. Police were called to the scene as there was a concern that both fires had been started deliberately.</p>
      <p>"Both vehicles sustained a significant amount of damage caused by the fire.</p>
      <p>"Police investigation to take place."</p>

      <p>Although few details of the exact nature of the fire were released, Owen said he was told petrol bombs were the most likely cause.</p>
      <p>"The police wouldn't say much but the fire brigade said it was either a bomb or a petrol bomb," he said. "They said a bomb was highly unlikely to it was most likely a petrol bomb.</p>
      <p>"There was a very heavy smell of petrol in the air around both cars.</p>
      <p>"There was a guy who quickly went past me just before I noticed the first car on fire and I think he must have had something to do with it."</p>
