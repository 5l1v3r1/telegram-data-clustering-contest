      <p>The USD/CAD pair drifted back closer to the lower end of its daily trading range post-Canadian GDP, albeit quickly recovered thereafter.</p>
      <p>According to the latest data released this Friday, the Canadian economy recorded a modest 0.1% MoM growth in October. Meanwhile, the annualized quarterly growth rate came in slightly better-than-expected, at 1.3% vs. 1.2% expected, and turned out to be the only factor exerting some pressure.</p>
      <h3>A combination of factors remained supportive</h3>
      <p>Despite slightly better-than-expected reading, the quarterly rate marked a significant deceleration from 3.7% growth recorded in the previous quarter. This coupled with a mildly softer tone surrounding crude oil prices kept a lid on any strong rally for the commodity-linked currency – <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad">loonie</a>.</p>
      <p>Adding to this, a goodish pickup in the US dollar demand, though lacked any obvious fundamental catalyst and seemed rather unaffected by a subdued action around the US Treasury bond yields, further collaborated towards limiting any meaningful pullback for the major.</p>
      <p>Looking at the broader picture, the pair remained confined well within a broader trading range held over the past one week or so and has been pivoting around the very important 200-day SMA. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a sustained break through the recent range before positioning for the next leg of a directional move.</p>
