      <h1>NFL playoff clinching scenarios for 49ers, Saints, Patriots in Week 13</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:14:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>NFL playoff clinching scenarios already are in play, and we still have five weeks remaining in the 2019 regular season. This is a testament to how strong the league's best teams have been this season.</p>
      <p>It should come as no surprise that the two teams with 10-1 records, the Patriots and 49ers, are among those that have the year's first chances to clinch spots in the NFL playoff picture. But the 9-2 Saints will have the first chance.</p>
      <p>New Orleans will play in Atlanta on Thanksgiving Night, and the Saints with a win would clinch the NFC South title for the third consecutive year. Even if the Saints and Falcons tie Thursday night, New Orleans still could clinch the division this week with a Carolina loss to Washington on Sunday.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Because they have divisional competition from the Seahawks and Bills, respectively, the 49ers and Patriots can't clinch their divisions this week, but they can secure playoff spots. Both will need a little help, with San Francisco needed just a win and a LA Rams loss to Arizona to officially reach the postseason.</p>
      <p>Easier said than done, though, for the 49ers against the red-hot Ravens. Baltimore is sitting pretty at 9-2, and although it can't clinch a playoff spot in Week 13, the Ravens will have some clinching scenarios next week should they take care of the 49ers at home.</p>
      <p>Below are all the clinching scenarios for the 49ers, Saints and Patriots in Week 13.</p>
