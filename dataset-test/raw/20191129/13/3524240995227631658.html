      <p>The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency on Friday in Lagos State arraigned man, Usman, who allegedly trafficked in 967.9kg of cannabis Sativa (marijuana).</p>
      <p>The agency charged Usman on one count of drug trafficking before a Federal High Court.</p>
      <p>The suit marked FHC/L/378/2019 is pending before Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo.</p>
      <p>The Prosecutor, Mr Jeremiah Aernan, alleged that the defendant committed the offence on September 15.</p>
      <p>He said that Usman unlawfully transported the large volume of a restricted substance in a bus, from the Eke-Akete area of Ajah, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>He noted that cannabis was restricted by law, adding that trafficking in same contravened the provisions of Sections 11(c) of the NDLEA Act of 2004.</p>
      <p>The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>
      <p>The court adjourned the case until February 24, 2020, for trial.</p>
