      <p>Youngsters at Willowbank School are leaving the classrooms to learn and explore the great outdoors thanks to their forest school.</p>
      <p>The school has been running part-time for three years and has recently become a full-time activity. Devon County Councillor John Berry has also recently donated money from his locality budget.</p>

      <p>Forest school leader at the school, Wendy Mogford said: “I am a passionate advocate for outdoor learning, and I think it’s perfect for the children’s wellbeing to be outside, connect with nature and learn how things grow.</p>
      <p>“I did a year course in training, and now I’m a level three forest school leader. I have been doing it part-time for two-years, but this is the first full-time year. Pupils love it; it’s their favourite time of the week.</p>
      <p>“They love being able to come outside, work as a team and link their learning with what they’re doing in the classroom.”</p>
      <p>Hannah Jay, deputy head of teaching and learning added: “We’re focusing a lot of our curriculum on certain skills we want the children to build and develop as they progress.</p>
      <p>“We’re hoping children will be inquisitive, question and be curious and be eager to take their learning across all school platforms.”</p>
      <p>Hannah added that they were grateful of the contribution made by Devon County Council.</p>
      <p>Cllr Berry visited the school on Tuesday, November 19 to see how the funding had been used.</p>

      <p>“I think this is marvellous,” he said. “It allows children to get their hands dirty and go in an area and be guided on how to plant, how to grow and you can see their work is coming to fruition, whether it be flowers or vegetables.</p>
      <p>“It takes children out into the fresh air, and it’s all good education for them. I’m pleased to be able to award some money to them.”</p>
