      <p>A PSNI statement added: “As is normal procedure all charges will be reviewed by the PPS [ Public Prosecution Service].”</p>
      <p>Earlier, police confirmed the baby boy’s death was being treated as murder.</p>

      <p>But senior investigating officer, Det Chief Insp <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Eamonn+Corrigan">Eamonn Corrigan</a>, said that “sadly, following the results of the post mortem, I can confirm I am now treating this as a murder investigation”.</p>
      <p>Det Chief <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Insp+Corrigan">Insp Corrigan</a> said his thoughts “remain with Hunter’s family and loved ones who are coming to terms with their devastating loss”.</p>
      <p>He said: “This is something no parent should ever have to experience. His family should be looking forward to Hunter’s second Christmas.”</p>
      <p>As part of the investigation, the police are seeking to trace the movements of a white BMW 5 Series, registration 11D14035, around the Keady area during the early hours of Tuesday November 26th.</p>
      <p>“Were you in the area and do you believe you saw this vehicle, or did you capture it on your dash cam?” asked Det Chief Insp Corrigan.</p>
      <p>“I would appeal to anyone who has any information to contact detectives on 101 quoting reference 587 of the 26/11/19. Alternatively information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”</p>
