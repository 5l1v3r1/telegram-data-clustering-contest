      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - The crew of a commercial airliner headed to Boston has reported being targeted by a green laser light.</p>
      <p>The Federal Aviation Administration tells The Boston Globe that the Southwest flight was about 16 miles from Boston's Logan International Airport and flying at 16,000 feet just before 9 p.m. Wednesday when the pilot spotted a green laser pointed at the right side of the plane.</p>
      <p>The FAA says the plane landed safely.</p>
      <p>The FAA has notified law enforcement and an investigation is underway.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, two commercial flights reported being targeted by lasers on approach to Logan.</p>
