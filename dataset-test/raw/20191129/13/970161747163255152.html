      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christmas/">Christmas</a> is just around the corner and now that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/halloween/">Halloween</a> has passed, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/thanksgiving-day/">Thanksgiving</a> has been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/thanksgiving-2019-usa-11192980/">celebrated across the pond</a> and the shopping bonanza that is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> is (almost) over, we can look forward to festive times ahead.</p>

      <p>December 1 is only days away, but how long does that leave us until Christmas is finally here?</p>
      <h3>How many sleeps until Christmas?</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, there are currently 26 ‘sleeps’ until Christmas day, but with the seconds literally ticking away until the big day, there’s easier ways to monitor how long is left before time off work for turkey and treats galore, other than counting the days on your calendar.</p>
