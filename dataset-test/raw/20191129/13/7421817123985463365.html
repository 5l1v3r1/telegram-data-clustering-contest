        <i>Hi Brenda,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I ruined one of the best friendships I’ve ever had by getting feelings involved. Is there anyway someone can come back from that? Is there a friendship to salvage?  </i>
      </p>

      <p>Dear Friendly Fiona,</p>
      <p>I think you are so brave in the first place to even be willing to attempt to convert a friendship into a romance. It is very important to remember that your friends are not your blood brothers.</p>
      <p>The only people you are actually related to are the only people you are actually related to, ok? That being said, I am very sorry for the loss of your friendship.</p>
      <p>Looking for love is always a risk, and that friendship was the casualty. But I would like to ask if you guys were really friends in the first place?</p>
      <p>Love based on friendship is one of the best forms of friendship, because friendship is one of the best forms of love.</p>
      <p>Was it really friendship if a little thing like feelings could shake it?</p>
      <p>Everyone has those feelings every so often. What you do with them is what determines what happens after.</p>
      <p>Maybe, honestly, it was just time for the friendship to end because it couldn't survive this obstacle. And that's ok too.</p>
