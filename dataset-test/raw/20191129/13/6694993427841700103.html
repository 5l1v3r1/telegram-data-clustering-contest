      <h2>A fire tore through Kassandra Yates-Conway's home after a power cut on Wednesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:43:36+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">Thomas George, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/thomas-george/</a></address>
      <p>The charred metal frame of a bunk bed is all that remains of a children's bedroom after a fire ripped through a family home in <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bolton">Bolton</a>.</p>
      <p>Mum Kassandra Yates-Conway says her children have lost everything 'apart from the clothes on their backs' following the blaze at their home in Wigan Road, Westhoughton, on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>Kassandra, 33, and her four daughters, aged 15, 11, 8, and 5, as well as her 19-month-old son, were out at the time, having gone to stay with relatives following a power cut earlier in the evening.</p>
      <p>When they returned several hours later, they found their home ablaze.</p>
      <p>Kassandra explained: "We had a power cut at about 8pm so I sent the children to relatives because I didn't want them sitting in the dark and cold.</p>

      <p>"I went to my grandma's house with my eldest daughter and got a message later in the evening saying the power was back.</p>
      <p>"When I came home I tried to switch the lights on and the house was full of smoke. We didn't know what was going on at first."</p>
      <p>After realising the upstairs of the property was on fire, Kassandra rushed outside with her daughter and the family's pet dog and waited for firefighters.</p>
      <p>Crews arrived at the scene at about 11.15pm and managed to bring the blaze under control. However, clothes, toys, cots and beds belonging to the children have all been destroyed.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of pounds worth of Christmas presents have also been damaged beyond repair.</p>
      <p>Kassandra said: "We've lost everything that was upstairs.</p>
      <p>"The kids don't have anything apart from the clothes on their backs.</p>
      <p>"One of my daughters was wearing her school uniform at the time so she doesn't have any of her own clothes left.</p>
      <p>"All their toys need to be thrown away because they're damaged. Nothing upstairs is salvageable.</p>
      <p>"I've been buying Christmas presents since June because we have a big family, but all of those are ruined."</p>

      <p>The blaze is believed to have started in an upstairs bedroom due to an electrical fault.</p>
      <p>The family have since been told the house is unlivable, and have been taken in by relatives while they search for long-term accommodation.</p>
      <p>However, despite her devastation, Kassandra says the outcome 'could have been a lot worse' had it happened in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/yates-conwayfire">JustGiving page</a> has since been set up in a bid to help the family replace the possessions they have lost.</p>
      <p>Drop off points for donations of clothing and household items have also been set up at The Hub in Central Drive, Westhoughton.</p>

      <p>Following the blaze, Greater Manchester Fire &amp; Rescue service have warned people not to overload plug sockets.</p>
      <p>GMFRS’ Head of Prevention, Area Manager Damian O’Rourke, said: “By taking just a few simple measures, you can significantly reduce the chance of an electrical fire in your home, ensuring you and your family are kept safe.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately at this incident, nobody was hurt and firefighters limited the damage to the first floor of the property, but it could have been far worse.</p>
      <p>“Plugging too many appliances into one socket can cause overheating which can then lead to a fire, so please avoid doing this and only ever use one extension lead per socket.”</p>
      <p>They have issued the following advice to residents:</p>
      <p>- Never overload plug sockets or extension leads</p>
      <p>- Keep extension leads to one per socket</p>
      <p>- Keep combustible materials away from sources of heat</p>
      <p>- Turn electrical products off at the socket when they are not being used</p>
      <p>- Check wires and cables for fraying regularly</p>
