      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends: First"</a> with hosts Todd Piro and Carley Shimkus, Alvarez said Friday that there are many ways your festive traditions could backfire.</p>
      <p>Alvarez's top safety tips include keeping the Christmas tree away from heat and consistently hydrating it, double-checking lights, using unbreakable ornaments, taking caution with poisonous plants and allergies, and working as a team.</p>

      <p>"The big thing about the safety of decorating now and in the Christmas holiday is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/fires">fire</a>," he said. "As a matter of fact, I'd remind everybody that this is a good time to check your fire alarms' batteries."</p>
      <p>Alvarez cautioned that there are big problems using older lights because they use more heat.</p>

      <p>"So, that's a good thing to keep in mind," he told the "Friends: First" hosts.</p>
      <p>The number one holiday-related injury is falling, so Alvarez advises to work together with family members.</p>

      <p>"When you're decorating – especially if you're putting lights around your house or in windows, whatever the case may be – just make sure that you have more than one person with you because you can lose your balance and break something," he said.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Alvarez wants Americans to know about potentially harmful toxins in ornaments, plants, and even the tree!</p>

      <p>He said that many "traditional hand-me-down family ornaments" were made with lead and the newer ornaments are plastic-based.</p>
      <p>He also warned viewers to be careful around poinsettias and hollies with your pets and avoid nut dishes if you have guests with severe allergies.</p>
      <p>"Always keep in mind about that," said Alvarez.</p>
