      <p>Rangers striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> has been included in the Europa League team of the week after his brace against Feyenoord.</p>
      <p>The Colombian took his record to 13 for the season with a double in Rotterdam, beating the record set by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/henrik-larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> .</p>
      <p>Morelos has risen from eighth to third in the UEFA power rankings as a result, and has also been named in the team of the week.</p>
      <p>Both strikers come from Group G, with El Bufalo partnering <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/porto">Porto</a> 's Vincent Aboubakar up-front.</p>

      <p>Other players to make the list include Lorenzo Pellegrini of Roma and Borussia Monchengladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer.</p>
      <p>Gers manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> said this week that the club wouldn't sell Morelos even for £50m and felt his performance in the Netherlands underlined that stance.</p>
      <p>He said after the match: "Do you believe me now? He’s not for sale. He’s not for sale at any price.</p>
      <p>“If you give the Buff the kind of service we did in the second half he’ll get you goals, it’s a simple as that."</p>
      <p><b>Europa League team of the week:</b> Sommer, Erkin, Merkis, Roco, Nuno Sequeira, Tsygankov, Bruno Fernandes, Pellegrini, Verbic, Morelos Aboubakar</p>
