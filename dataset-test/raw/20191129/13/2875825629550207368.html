      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:52:06+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers has refused to rule out replacing Unai Emery at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman has earned rave reviews for leading <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> up to second in the Premier League table, 11 points ahead of the Gunners.</p>
      <p>Rodgers is one of the names linked with the vacant post at the Emirates after the Gunners axed Emery following a dismal start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Foxes chief was quizzed on the speculation on Friday and left the door open.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's natural that there are links. If you are doing okay people want to take you away from something you enjoy. If you're not it doesn't matter.</p>

      <p>"There's always a number of names. We're at the beginning of something here. My relationship with the people here and the players is very strong. We think we are starting something exciting.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal is a fantastic club. One of the greats in this country. If the people at Arsenal have moved Unai on, I'm sure they have an idea of who they want to bring in.</p>
      <p>"There's disappointment whenever a coach loses his job. Unai has proved himself over a number of years. I have sympathy for him."</p>
