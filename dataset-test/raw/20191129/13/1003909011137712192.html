      <p>Of the many conclusions Arlene Dickinson shares in her book, Reinvention: Changing Your Life, Your Career, Your Future, the most surprising may be the one she came to after taking a hard look at herself.</p>
      <p>The Calgarian is a business leader, bestselling author, podcaster, public speaker, investor and TV personality, but she is most often defined under the broad umbrella term of entrepreneur.</p>
      <p>On the website for her Calgary-based marketing company, Venture Communications, visitors are welcomed to the “entrepreneurial revolution” and bombarded with snippets of wisdom called “Entrepreneurial Truths.” There’s a video called “Ode to Entrepreneurs.” In her bio, she is referred to as “One of Canada’s leading entrepreneurs” and the voice of the “entrepreneurial movement in Canada.” The messaging is crystal clear: Arlene Dickinson is synonymous with Canadian entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>But she admits that, not so long ago, she came to a jarringly different conclusion.</p>
      <p>“I had to recognize that I wasn’t the entrepreneur I said I was,” says Dickinson, in an interview with Postmedia from her Calgary office. “I realized that I wasn’t really an entrepreneur. I was a great small business owner. I was doing a lot of other things but I hadn’t really taken that big courageous thing that let me be all I wanted to be. I knew who I was, but I wasn’t exactly who I thought I was.”</p>
      <p>Dickinson’s first bestselling book, 2011’s Persuasion: A New Approach to Changing Minds, chronicled her rise from 31-year-old unemployed, divorced mother-of-four to CEO of one of Canada’s largest independently owned marketing firms. Her long tenure on CBC’s venture capitalist series Dragons’ Den, which she has been on since 2007 other than a two-season break in 2010 and 2011, only strengthened her reputation as a savvy entrepreneur who lends heartfelt support to deserving entrepreneurs from across the country.</p>
      <p>But, as with Persuasion, Reinvention actually begins with the author in a dark place. It’s 2013 and like many Calgarians she finds herself completely blindsided by the devastating summer flood. Venture, the downtown marketing firm she had spent 25 years building, was submerged. The months that followed were “chaotic and depressing,” she writes. She was in crisis mode and her team were scattered across the city. Key reviews by four of the company’s major clients ended badly. She didn’t sign any new clients during that period, either. Many of her staff left. She contemplated pulling the plug on the company.</p>
      <p>Instead, she chose to rebuild. But it was not only the company that needed reinvention. She needed to reinvent herself, which required an honest self-evaluation.</p>
      <p>When it came to Venture, she concluded, she had been on cruise control. She had spread herself too thin in other areas and her business was idling. In her introduction, she writes that the flood saved Venture because it forced her to take stock. As the head of a marketing company, she knew how to reinvent other companies. She needed to apply those skills to herself.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of fear in telling your story, you have to come clean with it: who I am and who I was and how I did this,” Dickinson says. “I thought by doing that maybe I could help other people do it, too. I’m a big believer in you can’t just talk the talk, you have to walk the walk.”</p>
      <p>Part of that was the realization that while she always considered herself an bold, daring entrepreneur, the reality was perhaps less clear.</p>
      <p>“In trying to save the business, I found a way to reinvent myself, too,” she says. “In order to reinvent the business, to look backwards for the business, I also had to look backwards at myself. That was probably the biggest ‘a-ha’ for me through this was really examining myself and who I was and what I was good at and what my purpose was in life. It’s hard to believe, at 57, you can figure out who you are. But that’s what it was.”</p>
      <p>As a female entrepreneur getting her start more than 30 years ago, Dickinson says she had “tempered her ambition,” a realization that certainly didn’t fit with her public persona.</p>
      <p>“Over 30 years ago, as a female entrepreneur, you were more measured about what you were capable of doing and how you believed in yourself,” she says.</p>
      <p>Six years later, Dickinson is confident that she has become the sort of entrepreneur she always wanted to be. The operation moved to a 27,000 square-foot building on Kensington Road and is an “ecosystem” that now also includes District Ventures Accelerator, District Ventures Capital, and District Ventures Marketing.</p>
      <p>“It’s completely changed,” she says. “We’re doing something really amazing from Calgary to help companies who are entrepreneurs. I love that. I’m proud of that. But it was really, really hard and it was painful. But it came out the other side.”</p>
      <p>But Reinvention is not just a cautionary memoir. The idea was to take the experience and construct a more universal process that readers from all walks of life could use to reinvent themselves.</p>
      <p>“In today’s world, so many people need to change or want to change, myself included, but we don’t know how or are too scared to,” she says. “When I went through this, I discovered when you took business principles and applied them to your life, it actually took away some of the fear and self-doubt and emotion and made positive change possible by focusing on a process.”</p>
      <p>So Reinvention offers a step-by-step plan that can be applied to rebooting professional and personal lives, laying out a blueprint for people to discover and come to grips with what they are good at and what they have to offer. While Dickinson is presumably aiming for a national or international audience with the book, she says the ideas in her book seem particularly pertinent to her home province, which is dealing with its own identity crisis as of late when it comes to the energy sector. She hopes Albertans who have become unemployed in the past few years will find value in the principles that encourage people to think about their “core purpose” and the context of the marketplace they want to reinvent themselves in. But she says the need for reinvention seems much broader in Alberta.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just the people whose livelihoods have been changed, but the industry also needs to reinvent itself,” she says.  “How is it going to take what it’s good at and what it’s core purpose is and the context of the marketplace and reinvent into something that looks like it can succeed into the future? I do say the industry also needs to think about its own reinvention. It’s in the process of doing that, thinking about how it can evolve through the energy we can produce today to the energy of tomorrow. But I think it’s not stated in a way that the world understands, particularly Canadians. So maybe there is a reinvention that needs to happen.”</p>
