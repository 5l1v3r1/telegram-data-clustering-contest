      <p>These headphones deliver HiFi precision stereo sound. They come with 50mm neodymium drivers, which are capable of delivering a full spectrum of sound.</p>
      <p>You'll also get a 1.5m cable with these headphones. The Philips SHP9500 headphones offer a double-layered headband cushion, which will make wearing these headphones really comfortable. The headband itself is made of steel, so there's not a chance it will break after brief use.</p>
      <p>A gold-plated connector is included here, while these headphones deliver impedance of 32 ohm. They offer a maximum power input of 200Mw, and a 101 dB of sensitivity. Speaker diameter, for those of you who want to know, is 50mm.</p>

      <p>You can unplug that cable that comes with the headphones in order to plug in a microphone or something of the sort. Do note that these headphones do not have a microphone in them, as they're made for audio listening. You can change that via an external microphone, though, of course.</p>
      <p>All in all, this is a well-rounded package. These headphones can be yours for $54.99 as we speak. Hurry up if you're interested, though, as this is a limited time deal. If you're interested, <a href="https://geni.us/1nNUrM0">tap here</a>, or click on the purchase button down below.</p>
