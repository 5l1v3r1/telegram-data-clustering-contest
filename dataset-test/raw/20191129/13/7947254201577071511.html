        <i>The designer’s barely-there halter dress – twinkling with Swarovski crystals – appeared in his sensual, hyper-glam Autumn/Winter 2019 collection</i>
      </p>
      <p>Belgium-born menswear designer <b>Ludovic de Saint Sernin</b> makes clothes which require a certain amount of bravery on the part of their wearer: his signature garment, for example, is a pair of lace-up leather briefs, and a recent runway show saw a model appear in nothing but a towel (at least, so it appeared – it was actually a skirt, finely knitted from merino wool). Such is the sexually-charged nature of his collections that they have spawned an X-rated Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ludovicdesaintserninx/?hl=en">@ludovicdesaintserninx</a>, whereby De Saint Sernin’s numerous fans submit photographs of themselves in the designer’s kinkier styles (or, occasionally, less).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.anothermag.com/tag/ludovic-de-saint-sernin">De Saint Sernin</a>’s Autumn/Winter 2019 collection, shown in Paris earlier this year, was similarly sensual – albeit channelled through the hedonistic, hyper-glam of the 1990s, the halcyon days of the supermodel. As befitting the nostalgic mood, the cooing tones of Naomi, Kate et al – voices lifted from the <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/9516/ten-fantastic-fashion-documentaries-to-watch-now">fashion documentaries</a> the designer watched religiously as a child – provided a soundtrack for a show which was his most seductive yet: “It’s time guys get their glam movement,” the designer enthused post-show. So there were low-slung trousers and high-sheen satin tailoring; diamanté belly chains and spaghetti-strap halter tops; references to legendary designers Azzedine Alaïa, in slinky, body-clinging knitwear, and Jean-Paul Gaultier, in high-waist trousers, cut to cinch the waist like a corset.</p>
      <p>But it was a collaboration with Swarovski which provided the collection’s most memorable moments: whether a nylon tank top, across which twinkled the designer’s name, or a pair of ‘million dollar eyelet briefs’, a bedazzled iteration of his signature underwear entirely encrusted with hundreds of Swarovski crystals (a playful nod to a certain underwear brand’s ‘Fantasy Bra’). Or, for the brave, this glittering, barely-there halter dress – captured here by photographer <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/12069/city-of-spiders-a-new-book-capturing-women-in-their-own-spaces">Maxime Imbert</a> and AnOther’s junior fashion editor, <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/user/RebeccaPerlmutar">Rebecca Perlmutar</a> – with which to channel your inner supermodel.</p>
