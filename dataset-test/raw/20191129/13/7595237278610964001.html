      <p>Injunctions preventing two protesters from blockading and intimidating people working or visiting a pet food manufacturing plant in Edgeworthstown, Co Longford have been formally struck out by the High Court.</p>
      <p>The orders were secured last September by C&amp;D Foods against Fine Gael Cllr Paraic Brady of The Meadows, Drumlish, Co Longford, and Colm Leonard of Aughanoran, Dring, Co Longford.</p>
      <p>C&amp;D Foods is owned by the ABP Food Group, which is one of Ireland's largest beef processors.</p>
      <p>Several of C&amp;D's plants were the scenes of protests earlier this year by farmers unhappy with the prices being paid for their product.</p>
      <p>The injunctions permanently prevented the defendants, their agents and anyone who has knowledge of the orders from trespassing at or blockading the plant, and from intimidating individuals going to and from the site.</p>
      <p>The matter returned before the High Court today when John Lavelle for C&amp;D Foods told Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds that the orders previously made by the court could be vacated and struck out.</p>
      <p>No orders were to be made in relation to the legal costs of the action, counsel said.</p>
      <p>Patricia Hill BL, for the two named defendants in the case, told the court that the striking out was on consent.</p>
      <p>The judge agreed to strike out the proceedings.</p>
