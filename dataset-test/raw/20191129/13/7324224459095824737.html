      <p>A three-year-old boy with suspected autism suffered fatal head injuries in a complete breach of trust by his killer, a lawyer told a court.</p>
      <p>Kayden McGuinness sustained 15 bruises on the scalp and died from swelling and bleeding of the brain.</p>
      <p>He was found dead in bed at his family flat in Londonderry in September 2017.</p>
      <p>Liam Whoriskey, 25, from Londonderry, was convicted of manslaughter and cruelty to a child by a jury at the city’s crown court in October.</p>
      <aside>He went from 0-60 - roaring and shouting<cite>Erin McLaughlin</cite></aside>
      <p>The former partner of the vulnerable toddler’s mother was supposed to be fulfilling the role of parent, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Peter Irvine QC said: “There was a complete breach of trust in this case.”</p>
      <p>The child died from blunt force trauma.</p>
      <p>Probation officers said Whoriskey, from Glenabbey Gardens, posed a significant risk to other members of the public.</p>
      <p>His former partner Erin McLaughlin said he was aggressive and violent.</p>
      <p>She said: “He went from 0-60 – roaring and shouting.”</p>
      <p>A pre-sentence hearing was held at Londonderry Crown Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>Kayden was found to have “extensive bruising” on the face and 15 bruises on the scalp caused by “blunt force trauma” to the head.</p>
      <p>That caused haemorrhage and swelling of the brain, Mr Irvine said.</p>
      <aside>This is a highly exceptional and very serious case where the culpability of the defendant is extremely high.<cite>Peter Irvine QC</cite></aside>
      <p>He died within half an hour from “non-accidental” injuries, examinations showed.</p>
      <p>Whoriskey had earlier taken the youngster to the city’s Richmond shopping centre.</p>
      <p>The child was seen lying on the floor of one of the shops and an assistant described Whoriskey’s behaviour as “abusive and violent”, the lawyer told the court.</p>
      <p>He said the defendant was observed holding the child by the hood of a jacket and by the wrists.</p>
      <p>Kayden was struggling to keep up with him while walking, he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year his mother, Ms McLaughlin, had observed a mark across his nose.</p>
      <p>Experts who gave evidence to the court testified that he had two black eyes caused by at least moderate force, the prosecution said.</p>
      <p>Mr Irvine said: “This is a highly exceptional and very serious case where the culpability of the defendant is extremely high – the deceased was clearly very vulnerable, a three-year-old boy.”</p>
      <p>He said pre-sentence reports showed the defendant posed a significant risk of serious harm.</p>
      <p>The defence challenged the term blunt-force trauma.</p>
      <p>Ciaran Mallon QC said expert witnesses had suggested the gravity of the conduct causing the injuries could be viewed as mild, minor or, at its height, moderate.</p>
      <p>He said culpability was not extremely high and his client had not intended to kill the child, rejecting any suggestion a life sentence was appropriate.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the child’s skull was not fractured and said sentencing severity should not approach the “heights” which the prosecution had sought to set out.</p>
      <p>Whoriskey will be sentenced by judge Philip Babington on December 16.</p>
