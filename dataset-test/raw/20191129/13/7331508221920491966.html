      <h1>NBA draft No. 1 pick debate: LaMelo, Edwards or Wiseman?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:27:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Givony, Mike Schmitz</a></address>
      <p>What has changed in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/draft/">2020 NBA draft</a> No. 1 pick race since the college basketball season began?</p>
      <p>Memphis big man <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4432808/james-wiseman">James Wiseman</a> originally had the top spot, but he <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/28176887/james-wiseman-12-game-suspension-upheld-ncaa">won't return to the court until Jan. 12 following an NCAA suspension</a>. In Wiseman's absence, Georgia's <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards">Anthony Edwards</a> and the NBL's LaMelo Ball have both put up extraordinary performances that have helped their cases as the top prospect.</p>
      <p>So who should be No. 1 now? What do NBA teams think? And how close is the race among these three prospects?</p>
