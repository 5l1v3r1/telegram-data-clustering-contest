      <p>While cities cover only 3% of the earth's surface, they consume 75% of its natural sources, Turkey's Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said Friday.</p>
      <p>The world's cities generate 80% of all the money, 90% of innovation activities and 50% of all waste, Kurum said at the Turkey 2023 Summit in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>The world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and 63% of this population will live in cities, which will constitute 91% of all consumption, he said.<br/><br/>To deal with this situation, the world is looking at environmentally friendly buildings, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, transportation by drones and zero-waste, Kurum added.</p>
      <p>Economically the world's 20 major cities exceed some countries. For instance, London, New York and Tokyo economically surpass the Netherlands, Canada and South Korea, respectively, he said.</p>
      <p>"According to U.N. estimates, the number of these megacities will reach 41 in 2030," he stressed.</p>
      <p>Referring to Turkey's environmental targets, he said the country aims to use natural sources and water more efficiently.</p>
