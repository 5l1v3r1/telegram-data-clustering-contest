      <h1>Company apologizes after uproar over headscarf ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:51:01+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">YUSUF ZIYA DURMUŞ</a></address>
      <p>A recruitment firm apologized and fired a staff member after it was revealed on social media that it turned down the employment application of a headscarf-wearing woman.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user with the handle "Gonca_JK" had shared a screenshot of the rejection message by the company on Nov. 28. "We are sorry, we don't hire personnel with a headscarf," the message reads.<br/><br/>She had applied for work at an Ankara store for Mavi Jeans, a prominent jeans brand and received overwhelming support on social media at a time of increasing attacks targeting headscarf-wearing women.<br/><br/>Mavi Jeans officials said in a statement on Friday that the company had "no such policy" of not employing headscarf-wearing applicants and the rejection stemmed from Parlar, a recruitment company they worked with.</p>
      <p>Officials said they terminated the contract with the company upon the incident. In a separate statement, Parlar apologized to the applicant and said the rejection was "the work of a staff member acting on her/his own." They said they terminated the contract with the staff member on Thursday.<br/><br/>Headscarf-wearing women occasionally make headlines for the discrimination they face in the private sector in Turkey where they have been barred from schools and the public sector for decades.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Turkish Human Rights and Equality Agency (TİHEK) fined a publisher and a job website for posting a job advertisement that barred headscarf-wearing individuals from applying.</p>
