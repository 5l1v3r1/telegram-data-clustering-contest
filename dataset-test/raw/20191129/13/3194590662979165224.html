        <b>Ayo Makun, Nigerian comedian better known as AY, has celebrated his 11th anniversary with Mabel, his wife.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The popular comedian took to his social media page on Friday to flaunt a lovely picture of himself posing with his wife and daughter.</p>
      <p>In a series of post shared on his verified Instagram handle, AY was particularly full of praise for his wife, describing her as as “friend, sister, soulmate and mother.”</p>
      <p>“You have been my beloved friend and sister in the last 16 years, my lovely wife, soulmate and mother in the last 11 years. So let us continue to grow old together. Happy Anniversary,” he wrote in one of the posts.</p>

      <p>AY and Mabel got married in Lagos on November 29, 2008. The union has witnessed highs and lows since then, but the couple have continued to stick by each other.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the comedian had <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/ay-makun-freda-francis-mabel/"><b>slammed</b></a> bloggers peddling rumours that his marriage was heading for a crack.</p>
      <p>“Some blogs are, for the most part, the bringers of bad news… and it’s not entirely the bloggers fault, bad news gets higher ratings, travels faster and sells more than good news,” he had said.</p>
      <p>“Gossip is just a tool to distract people who have nothing better to do from feeling jealous of those few who are still remaining in the institution called ‘Celebrity Marriage’.”</p>
