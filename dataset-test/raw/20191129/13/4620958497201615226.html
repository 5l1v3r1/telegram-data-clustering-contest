      <p>Everyone’s favourite 1980s extra-terrestrial has returned to Earth, making a stop in North Vancouver.</p>
      <p>E.T. was brought back to life for an Xfinity commercial for Comcast that was shot on Patterdale Drive in the District of North Vancouver earlier this fall.</p>
      <p>The commercial, which is more than four minutes long, features the original E.T., who was brought here from the Smithsonian where he had been on display for years. The video also features a grown-up Elliot played by Henry Thomas, the same actor who portrayed E.T.’s young friend in the 1982 Steven Spielberg film.</p>
      <p>The production featured two homes and a cul-de-sac in North Vancouver’s Capilano neighbourhood, along with scenes shot on Burnaby Mountain.</p>
