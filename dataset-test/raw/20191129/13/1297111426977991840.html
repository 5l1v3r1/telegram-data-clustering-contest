      <h2>Rob Vanstone remembers the 2009 Grey Cup, in which Montreal defeated the Saskatchewan Roughriders due to the "13th man" meltdown.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:42:11+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/robvanstone" target="_blank">Rob Vanstone</a></address>
      <p>Precisely 10 years after the “13th-man” unravelling, it can now be said (or written): I accept full responsibility.</p>
      <p>The Vanstone Curse, always dangerous, was especially lethal on Nov. 29, 2009 at McMahon Stadium in Calgary.</p>
      <p>Just 10:32 remained in the 97th Grey Cup when the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ Darian Durant ran for a touchdown that helped the CFL’s West Division champions assume a 27-11 lead over the heavily favoured Montreal Alouettes.</p>
      <p>Moments after the Roughriders’ quarterback crossed the goal line, I turned toward Regina Leader-Post sports-department colleague Ian Hamilton, who was seated to my right, and said: “Darian Durant just made himself a lot of money.”</p>
      <p>At that point, I got a head-start on writing the once-inconceivable “Roughriders win 2009 Grey Cup” column, pumping out a few hundred words in very short order about the miracle of it all — a 10-7-1 Saskatchewan team somehow upsetting a 15-3-0 edition of the Alouettes, etc., etc., etc., blah, blah, blah, yak, yak, yak …</p>
      <p>DELETE.</p>
      <p>Make the final: Montreal 28, Saskatchewan 27.</p>
      <p>Dare I elaborate? (Gulp.)</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, Montreal scored back-to-back touchdowns to narrow the gap to 27-25. The Alouettes had a chance to tie the game with a two-point conversion, but an Anthony Calvillo pass fell incomplete (primarily because Saskatchewan should have been flagged for pass interference).</p>
      <p>On the Alouettes’ final possession, they marched into field-goal range, whereupon Damon Duval was called upon to attempt a game-winning 43-yarder in the waning seconds.</p>
      <p>When the kick sailed wide to the right, the Roughriders and their fans celebrated a Grey Cup victory, at least for a few seconds.</p>
      <p>Then everyone saw the flags. So many flags.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders had been penalized for too many men on the field.</p>
      <p>Their slogan — The 13th Man Makes All The Difference — was all too true.</p>
      <p>The clock showed 0:00 but, because a game cannot end on a penalty, Duval was given one more chance. From 10 yards closer, he split the uprights. Of course he did.</p>
      <p>It seemed like only the Alouettes were celebrating.</p>
      <p>Of the 46,020 people who were at McMahon Stadium that day, at least 40,000 (likely a low estimate) had to be cheering for Montreal.</p>
      <p>My wife, Chryssoula, was among the mourners in the stands. Such was her introduction to a Grey Cup game, in person.</p>
      <p>I remember sitting in the press box, wondering what to make of it all, with an inflexible and annoying deadline looming.</p>
      <p>For some reason, I stared at Roughriders defensive end John Chick as he made the long, slow walk off the field and toward the dressing room.</p>
      <p>Only then did I begin to assemble my thoughts for public consumption.</p>
      <p>I flashed back to 33 years and one day earlier, when a 12-year-old me was at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto for what had been the most heartbreaking loss in Roughriders history.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 28, 1976, I was in the stands alongside my sainted mother when Tony Gabriel made THAT catch — a 24-yarder with 20 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter — to give the Ottawa Rough Riders a 23-20 Grey Cup victory.</p>
      <p>For that game, Saskatchewan had been the prohibitive favourite, with 38-year-old Ron Lancaster playing the role of Calvillo. Ottawa had the upstart quarterback, Tom Clements, playing the role of Darian Durant.</p>
      <p>After so many seasons of post-season frustration, it seemed like 1976 would finally be the year in which Saskatchewan captured that elusive second Grey Cup title.</p>
      <p>The Western Conference final, in which Saskatchewan finally defeated Edmonton after losing to the Eskimos for three consecutive years with a Grey Cup berth at stake, seemed like the final step.</p>
      <p>Ottawa had other thoughts.</p>
      <p>So, in 2009, I attempted to put myself in the shoes of the inconsolable fans who had just been Tony Gabriel’ed, not even knowing at the time that Gabriel himself was at the game.</p>
      <p>The approximate hour in which the column was composed and filed remains a blur. I am ordinarily a stickler for details, but they elude me in this case.</p>
      <p>What does stand out, though, is the trip back to downtown Calgary in a deluxe media bus. As the vehicle pulled out of the parking lot, I looked at a deserted McMahon Stadium — still fully illuminated — and thought: “What just happened here?”</p>
      <p>Ten years later, I am still asking myself that question.</p>
