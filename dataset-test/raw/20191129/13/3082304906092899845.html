        <b>Despite initially retiring from the track in 2017, Mo Farah will defend his 10,000 metres title at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mo Farah has performed a U-turn and elected to defend his 10,000m title at the Tokyo Olympics next year.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, Farah walked away from track events to concentrate on marathons and he finished eighth across 26.2 miles in Chicago last month having won the event in 2018.</p>
      <p>However, the 36-year-old has decided to return to shorter distances and will aim to add to his Olympic medal collection at the next Games.</p>
      <p>Farah, who will still need to qualify for the event in Tokyo, won gold over 5,000m and 10,000m at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.</p>
      <p>“It’s been really exciting to compete at the marathon for the last couple of years,” Farah said in a message posted on his YouTube Channel.</p>
      <p>“To win the Chicago Marathon, as a major marathon, that was nice. To finish third in the London Marathon, was okay, it was good.</p>

      <p>“It’s been a good learning curve for me – doing the marathon, to run 2:05 – British record, European record. The training for it was totally different to the track.</p>
      <p>“Next year I’ve decided, Tokyo 2020, I’m going to be back on the track. I’m really excited to be competing back on the track and giving it a go in the 10,000 metres.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I haven’t lost my speed. I’ll train hard for it and see what I can do.”</p>
