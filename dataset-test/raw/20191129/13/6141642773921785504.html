      <p>Liverpool midfielder Fabinho will be out for more than a month after suffering ankle ligament damage during this week’s Champions League clash with Napoli.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian, who has this season established himself as a first-choice pick for Jurgen Klopp’s Premier League leaders, was substituted after just 18 minutes of the 1-1 draw at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The Reds have now announced that the 26-year-old will play no part in their congested run of 10 games between now and the end of December.</p>

      <p>A club statement read: “Liverpool can confirm Fabinho suffered ankle ligament damage during the Champions League encounter with Napoli in midweek.</p>
      <p>“Further assessment on the injury has discovered Fabinho will be out of action until the new year.</p>
      <p>“The Brazilian will begin a rehabilitation programme with the Reds’ medical team at Melwood as he works his way back to full fitness.”</p>
