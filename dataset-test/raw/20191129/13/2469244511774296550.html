      <p>Christmas has come to Tiverton Hospital thanks to a fair to raise funds for future equipment.</p>
      <p>The League of Friends at the Tiverton and District Hospital hosted their festive craft fair on Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>Lin Olsen, who organises the fair said: “All money goes to the League of Friends to buy equipment for patients in the hospital.</p>
      <p>“We always appreciate the support we get here at the fair and would encourage people to come and give their time for our hospital. Without public support, we wouldn’t be here.”</p>

      <p>Chairman of the League of Friends, Arthur Govier, added that 2019 had been a good year for them.</p>
      <p>“We have had requests from the wards for equipment, and we’ve been able to meet virtually every request,” he said. “We have had a big input into rehab as well. There is a lot of emphasis on that now.</p>
      <p>“We hope to continue to buy new equipment and replace old and keep the hospital up-to-date to meet the patient’s needs.</p>
      <p>“We are taking a lot of pressure off Exeter by providing services here that wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the League of Friends.  We try to make Tiverton hospital for Tiverton people. We try and take the pressure off the staff by supporting them with the right equipment.”  </p>
