      <p>Long have vegans waited for a decent vegan delivery option.</p>
      <p>Long have vegans had to make do with just a large pile of chips.</p>
      <p>No more.</p>
      <p>Well, actually, a little more, but soon this misery will end.</p>
      <p>After rumours that Domino’s was testing out a vegan pizza, the brand has now officially confirmed that a plant-based pizza is a real thing that’s definitely happening.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Domino’s told Metro.co.uk: ‘The rumours are true. We have been working hard to perfect a vegan recipe with the unmistakable taste of Domino’s fresh dough and cheesy goodness.</p>
      <p>‘We’re not quite there yet, but vegan pizza lovers shouldn’t have to wait much longer.’</p>
      <p>Unfortunately this statement didn’t come with a more specific time frame, so we can’t tell you if you can look forward to a vegan pizza delivered to your door before 2019 ends.</p>

      <p>All they’ve said is that the pizza isn’t ready ‘yet’. We’d imagine that not having to wait ‘much longer’ would mean under a year. So perhaps we’ll welcome in 2020 with a plant-based cheese celebration?</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting that this pizza won’t be one of those copouts where it’s just tomato sauce on bread. Domino’s specifically said ‘cheesy goodness’, so they will be creating a dairy-free alternative.</p>
      <p>While we wait for this magical creation to be perfected, it’s worth noting that Papa John’s and Pizza Hut already do vegan pizzas, so if you can convince your pals to swap their dough-based allegiance, you can still get in on a delivery.</p>
