      <p>Mark Warburton wants Queens Park Rangers to channel their “anger and frustration” in the right way against <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Rangers head to Pride Park on Saturday to play the Rams on the back of a six-game winless run which has seen them slip to 16th in the Sky Bet Championship table.</p>
      <p>The latest defeat came at home to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday when they were beaten 4-0 by Sabri Lamouchi’s men.</p>
      <p>Lee Wallace was sent off five minutes into the second-half with the score at 1-0 – and will miss the game with Derby.</p>

      <p>Boos were audible from the home crowd at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium, with fans growing frustrated by recent form.</p>
      <p>Warburton wants his side to embrace the challenge.</p>
      <p>“There should be an anger and a frustration and you have to channel that in the right way,” Warburton told <a href="https://www.qpr.co.uk/news/club-news/warburton-we-have-to-provide-a-response/">QPR’s official website.</a></p>
      <p>“Every player and every staff member is accountable. I’m manager – I’m accountable – and that is how it works. We know our professional standards, individually and collectively, and we all have a responsibility to ourselves, to teammates and to our fans. That goes to every player at every club.</p>
      <p>“You have to recognise that responsibility and embrace it; that’s the job. From minute 81 to 90 on Wednesday, we didn’t embrace it.</p>
      <p>“We have to respond and recognise what we face on Saturday – a talented team with a good home record who, in their minds, will be looking to right their own wrong of their defeat at Fulham. It’s an opportunity for us to correct things very quickly.”</p>
      <p>Derby will be relieved to be back on home soil this weekend and looking to make it six wins in a row at Pride Park for the first time since 2010.</p>
      <p>It is a stark contrast to their away form, which has seen them lose four on the bounce without scoring a goal.</p>

      <p>“We have a chance on Saturday to react,” Warburton said.</p>
      <p>“Derby got beat 3-0, we got beat at home, it's going to be two teams who I'm sure will have a point to prove.</p>
      <p>“You go and do your jobs, you accept responsibility and you say the first thing I'm going to do is do my job.</p>
      <p>“Do your basics brilliantly well and the rest will naturally flow.”</p>
