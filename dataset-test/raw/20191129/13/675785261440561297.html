      <h2>Arsenal chiefs announced the Unai Emery's sacking on Friday morning, with the decision to end his tenure and make Freddie Ljungberg interim boss taken on Monday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:55:04+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal decision to sack <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> was made on Monday.</p>
      <p>Amid ongoing concern about results, but also performances, the club's hierarchy organised a meeting in the United States with owner Stan Kroenke and his director son Josh, just 48 hours after the draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>Emery’s final weeks in charge left the club flat, the team in disarray and a feeling of doom at the training ground.</p>
      <p>And it was ultimately the meeting on Monday in which <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> decided to dismiss the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Then it was just a matter of timing as to when they would pull the trigger.</p>

      <p>Head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham flew to the States on Monday for the crunch meeting.</p>
      <p>But they wanted to be respectful to Emery and wanted to give Freddie Ljungberg time to get himself ready for when they called on him to step up.</p>
      <p>Then, in front of a half-empty Emirates, Arsenal lost to Eintracht Frankfurt, with a limp second half display, which saw them take the decision overnight to axe the ex-Sevilla boss immediately.</p>
      <p>Emery reported up to the club’s London Colney training ground where he had a short meeting with Sanllehi who broke the news, before being joined by technical director Edu and Venkatesham.</p>
      <p>They then spoke to Emery’s coaches and it is understood the Spaniard was respectful, understood the decision and said goodbye to staff, even hugging those that he had worked closely with.</p>
      <p>There seemed to be an acceptance that it just had not worked out.</p>
      <p>When all of the players reported up, they were called into a dressing room and Sanllehi addressed the group to explain the decision in a meeting which lasted roughly 10 minutes.</p>

      <p>Edu joined shortly afterwards to issue a rallying cry before Ljungberg then took over.</p>
      <p>It was Ljungberg who took the session this morning and the feeling is that he will immediately have the respect of the players.</p>
      <p>Arsenal will begin the process of finding a successor with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> boss Nuno, Carlo Ancelotti and Max Allegri among those touted.</p>
      <p>But Arsenal’s attitude is that Ljungberg has a genuine chance and, if he can emulate what Frank Lampard has done at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , then he could get the job permanently.</p>

      <p>Ljungberg has told the Arsenal players they can still reach the top four after a dramatic morning at the club’s training ground.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg gave a rallying cry to the players after Unai Emery was sacked this morning and the Arsenal legend then took training ahead of Sunday’s trip to Norwich.</p>
      <p>Former Sweden midfielder Ljungberg tried to lift the mood after Emery’s departure and a run of seven games without a win left Arsenal eight points outside of the Champions League places.</p>
      <p>But Ljungberg’s first message was to tell the players they have enough time and quality within the squad to make it.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg will also appoint his own coaching team, although it may not be ex-first team coach Steve Bould who now works with the club’s under-23s.</p>
      <p>And despite reports, Ljungberg does have all his necessary coaching badges and Arsenal are baffled as to where that rumour came from as he is a respected youth coach and would not have got this far without qualifications.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are hoping that Ljungberg can lift the mood after Emery’s final weeks in charge left the club flat, the team in disarray and also doom at the training ground.</p>
