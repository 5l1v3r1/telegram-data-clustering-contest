      <p>Piers Morgan has hit back at Caitlyn Jenner’s partner Sophia Hutchins, after she branded him pathetic.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old lashed out at the TV presenter, after he quizzed her about her relationship with Caitlyn on Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>After spotting Sophia’s comments in a news article on Twitter, Piers told her to “get over” herself.</p>

      <p>During her interview with Piers, he asked if there was any “hanky panky” between her and Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>Sophia was clearly annoyed by Piers’ probing questions, and later branded him “pathetic” on her Instagram Story.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “Good Morning Britain, having Piers Morgan is your biggest mistake. What a joke of a journalist he is. What a pathetic line of questioning he had for me this morning. Totally not cool.”</p>

      <p>“I went on to support Caitlyn on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!, not deal with stupid bulls**t questions from some jackass like Piers Morgan.”</p>
      <p>“Neither of us will ever do your show again. You have shown your true colours. How disappointing,” she added.</p>
      <p>During Sophia’s awkward interview on GMB, Piers also asked her to clarify her relationship with Caitlyn, which has always been a bit of mystery.</p>
      <p>Piers asked, “If you’re not an item, why aren’t you an item?”</p>

      <p>Sophia laughed and replied: “Was that a real question? We have a really special relationship. I don’t think we need to be an item to have a really special relationship so to speak.”</p>
      <p>“I am here for Caitlyn 1,000 thousand percent and Caitlyn’s here for me 1,000 percent. I think the best way to describe our relationship is that we are partners in every sense of the word.”</p>
      <p>“When it comes to work, absolutely there for each other 100 percent. When it comes to family and our personal relationship, absolutely there for each other 100 percent and there’s no denying it.”</p>
