      <h1>Doctor Doom Rumored to Be the Villain in BLACK PANTHER 2</h1>

      <p>An interesting rumor has surfaced regarding the villain in<b><i> Black Panther 2</i></b>. According to <a href="https://www.murphysmultiverse.com/what-i-heard-this-week-black-panther-ii/">Charles Murphy</a>, "trustworthy sources" have told him that the villain of <i>Black Panther 2</i> will be Doctor Doom. Obviously Marvel has not confirmed this, so we need to treat this as a big fat compelling rumor, but, it’s still fun to think about and discuss the possibility of if it’s true!</p>
      <p>The report explains, “Victor Von Doom will begin expanding his empire, conquering parts of Africa and, ultimately, come into conflict with the nation of Wakanda and the Black Panther.” There was no other additional information given. It’ll be interesting to see how Doom is introduced in the MCU if this actually turns out to be true.</p>
      <p>The report speculates that the events of Infinity War and the five year time jump in<i>Endgame</i> “provide ample opportunities for some exposition on the Latverian Monarch. Given the state of things after Thanos’ snap, it wouldn’t be too hard to imagine someone like Victor expanding his kingdom by taking advantage of the absence of world leaders and of most of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. If Victor survived the snap, it’s entirely possible that he could have made his way South through Europe, through the Middle East and into Africa by the time 2023 rolls around.”</p>
      <p>Doctor Doom and Black Panther do have a history in the comics. In the 2010 <i>Black Panther: Doomwar </i>story arc Doom invades Wakanda for the Vibranium. This is a big story filled with all kinds of characters that could easily be adapted and simplified for a more intimate MCU film that puts the focus on T’Challa, Doom, and Shuri.</p>
      <p>I’d actually love to see this story told, but we’ll just have to wait and see if there’s any truth to it. In the meantime, let us know what you think of a Black Panther film with Doom as the villain. Would you want to see this? If so, how would you like the story to play out?</p>
      <p><i>Black Panther 2</i> hits theaters on May 6th, 2022.</p>
