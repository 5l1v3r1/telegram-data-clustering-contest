      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/chris-jericho">Chris Jericho</a> was interviewed recently by WCW Legends Disco Inferno and Konnan on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBzrj1RNGv4298GrYCYriFQ">Keepin' it 100 </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBzrj1RNGv4298GrYCYriFQ"><u>Podcast</u></a>. Jericho spoke about the creative process and how AEW differs from WWE, especially with respect to the promos.</p>
      <p>Jericho then discussed Survivor Series and explained that although he liked the show, he felt the way WWE built up <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">Bray Wyatt</a> aka The Fiend in promos was not believable and felt "cartoonish".</p>
      <blockquote>"I watched Survivor Series and it was really good. But they had this promo with Daniel Bryan and Miz and it's like, for the sake of our children, our families, you have to stop The Fiend. Nobody talks like that. You know what I mean? You can still put the guy over big time but, not worry, like, what... is he's going to come to your house and break in your house and steal your kids... it's just not believable. And it's cartoonish in a bad way."</blockquote>
      <p>Jericho also added that his promo with Scorpio on Dynamite was cartoonish but fit well with the characters.</p>
      <blockquote>"What we did last week with Scorpio was cartoonish too, like if the guy would allow himself to be talked into a championship match but it worked. Because it was fun and you had the right characters to do it."</blockquote>

      <p>Some WWE fans may not agree with Jericho's opinion about The Fiend's booking, but his criticisms do carry weight as he seems to provide a very careful analysis of both companies and their use of promos.</p>
