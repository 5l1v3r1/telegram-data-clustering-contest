      <p>TDP leader and former chairman of the Andhra Pradesh SC, ST Commission, Karem Shivaji, joined the YSRCP on Friday in the presence of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.</p>
      <p>Mr. Shivaji resigned to the post on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Shivaji said he quit the TDP as there was no recognition for him in the party.</p>
      <p>“I am inspired by Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s objectives and welfare schemes,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Shivaji, a Mala Mahanadu leader, had joined the TDP just after the 2014 elections. He was appointed as the first chairman of the commission in the residuary State.</p>
