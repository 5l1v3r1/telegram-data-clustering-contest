      <p>The Croatian striker had reportedly been a United target during the summer but stayed at Juventus, where he is yet to make an appearance this season.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Athletic</i>, United have now dropped their interest in the Croatian, with other targets including <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erling-braut-haaland/"><b>Erling Braut Haaland</b></a> now <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-utd-to-make-january-move-for-haaland_380742.html">being considered</a>.</p>
      <p>The report states that United have concerns over Mandzukic's fitness levels and want a player ready for action immediately.</p>
      <p>United sold <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/romelu-lukaku/"><b>Romelu Lukaku</b></a> to Inter Milan during the summer, while injuries to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcus-rashford/"><b>Marcus Rashford</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/anthony-martial/"><b>Anthony Martial</b></a> have seen them short on striking options.</p>
      <p>Mandzukic has scored 44 goals in four-and-a-half seasons at Juventus and also netted for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/croatia/"><b>Croatia</b></a> in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final.</p>
