        <b>Aries</b>
      </p>
      <p>Itchy feet? It’s little wonder with ruler Mars energising your travel sector. Expect to be gripped with wanderlust and a chronic urge to get away which can only be sated by doing exactly that. If an escape isn’t imminent at least make plans for a holiday. Knowing it’s on the cards will appease your restlessness.</p>

        <b>Taurus</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even though it’s the weekend mundane tasks may be catching up with you. Make an effort to infuse chores and your routine with something different and concoct ways to enrich your life with adventure. You’ll see that the Universe has an uncanny way of making all of your resources come together when you need them!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gemini</b>
      </p>
      <p>Have a little faith! Even if you don’t believe in miracles the stars are conspiring to make everything go your way. Specifically, Venus in your sector of windfalls means a win of sorts whether it’s a legal dispute, lottery or inheritance will be an unexpected bonus. You’ll find that people are also be extremely generous.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Loving Venus has just moved into your relationship sector so you’re bound to have a magical weekend in store! If you don’t have any plans a spontaneous arrangement will be just the thing to spice up your love life. If you are single get out there and meet people or let a friend play Cupid.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leo</b>
      </p>
      <p>Work is about to take on a pleasant and creative spin in a more social setting. Artistic, whimsical Venus has just moved into your sector of productivity for the next three weeks or so ensuring that harmony reigns supreme with colleagues. You’ll also enjoy brainstorming together and trading clever, unique ideas. Under this placement romance may also blossom!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgo</b>
      </p>
      <p>Flirt alert! Being forward isn’t your usual style but with vivacious Venus in your sector of love affairs and romance it may be difficult to contain your inner vixen. The planet of love and style is known for endowing charisma and appeal so if you’ve got it, why not flaunt it? Get out there!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Libra</b>
      </p>
      <p>You’ll be less willing to play nice if it means compromising your desires. The need to take control can be a productive but also destructive driving force. Being assertive will certainly be beneficial but again, try not to be too overbearing. Work in unity with other - being bossy will only put others on the defensive.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scorpio</b>
      </p>
      <p>You may have felt a bit like a hamster monotonously running on its wheel. However, this weekend provides a respite from woes and worries. Go out with friends, change the way you look at something and get a nature fix. All of these will act as the perfect circuit breaker to free you from tedium and tension.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sagittarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>Something or someone is testing you. You may need to jump through one more hoop, pass yet another clandestine test or simply do a little more ground work. Hang in there, Saggie! Tenacity is one of your greatest traits so don’t throw in the towel or have an epic tantrum and you will pass with flying colours.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Capricorn</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cautious and measured, you like to know what the future will bring. However, this is one of those days when you need to expect the unexpected! Last minute changes to plans may initially be frustrating for Goats who like to be in control but they will ultimately bring some wonderful surprises and perks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aquarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a ‘fixed’ sign you like to know what lies ahead. However, the stars are encouraging you to adopt a ‘come what may’ attitude and release the reins a little. There’ll be twists and turns in today’s fabric but if you go with the flow and view each change as positive a world of possibilities will open up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pisces</b>
      </p>
      <p>Your friendship sector faces challenging but wonderful, exciting times as the stars expose you to new people and information. Don’t be quick to lay blame as last minute inconveniences will be largely circumstantial. It’s also vital that you have your diary handy and double check dates, times and places because your presence will be in high demand.</p>
