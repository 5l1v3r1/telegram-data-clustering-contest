      <p>BC Hydro has released a new video of construction progress at Site C on the Peace River outside Fort St. John. </p>
      <p>Spillway foundations were finished in October, penstocks continue to be assembled at the generating station, and crews continue to excavate and line the tunnels that will divert the river and allow construction on the the 60-metre high earthfill dam to begin. </p>
