      <p>It will be a busy off-season for the Saskatchewan Roughriders when it comes to free agents.</p>
      <p>Thirty-two Roughriders players are eligible to hit the CFL’s open market on Feb. 11, although there is always the option of re-signing with the Green and White before then.</p>
      <p>A total of 280 players are on the CFL’s list of pending free agents, which was released Thursday.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at the Riders’ free-agent candidates, with some thoughts on other teams’ pending free agents who could be of interest to Saskatchewan. An international player is denoted by an asterisk.</p>
      <p><b>QUARTERBACKS</b> — None.</p>
      <p><b>The skinny: </b><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-craig-dickenson-is-coach-of-the-year-runner-up">Cody Fajardo is under contract through the 2021 season, providing the Riders with stability at the CFL’s key position</a>. Backups Isaac Harker, Bryan Bennett and Justice Hansen are under contract heading into the 2020 season.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s available:</b> Three quarterbacks from the Winnipeg Blue Bombers — Zach Collaros, Chris Streveler and Matt Nichols. Nick Arbuckle, who was an effective fill-in for the injured Bo Levi Mitchell with the Calgary Stampeders, has announced his intention to pursue free agency and will draw attention.</p>
      <p><b>RECEIVERS — </b>Manny Arceneaux*, Shaq Evans*, Naaman Roosevelt*, Cory Watson.</p>
      <p><b>The skinny: </b><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/shaq-evans-surpasses-1000-receiving-yards-for-the-saskatchewan-roughriders">Evans led the Riders in receiving yards (1,334) and topped the CFL in average yards per catch (18.6) and receptions of more than 30 yards (15)</a>. However, the 28-year-old Evans is reportedly interested in the NFL. Roosevelt, 31, was clutch for the Riders with a team-high 24 second-down receptions. He had 946 receiving yards, but only one touchdown. Arceneaux, 32, was a leader in the locker room, but his production was limited and the Riders may have other younger options on the roster. Watson was effective, but at 36 next season the Riders may move one of their younger receivers into a starting role.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s available: </b>Calgary’s Reggie Begelton might be the cream of a talented group. Begelton was third in the CFL with 1,444 receiving yards and tied for third with 10 receiving touchdowns.</p>
      <p><b>RUNNING BACKS — </b>Albert Awachie, Kienan LaFrance, Marcus Thigpen*.</p>
      <p><b>The skinny:</b> Three-time 1,000-yard rusher William Powell is under contract through next season. Thigpen will be 34 when the 2020 season kicks off, but showed there was still life left in his legs as a running back and returner. LaFrance played on all four special teams and was second on the Riders with 15 special-teams tackles. A<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/albert-awachie-is-an-unsung-hero-for-the-saskatchewan-roughriders">wachie was a key contributor on special teams and his contributions on offence were often overlooked.</a></p>
      <p><b>Who’s available: </b>William Stanback of the Montreal Alouettes is reportedly interested in the NFL after finishing third in the CFL in rushing yards (1,048) and posting five rushing touchdowns. C.J. Gable (Edmonton Eskimos) was fifth in rushing yards (1,001) despite missing four games due to injuries.</p>
      <p><b>OFFENSIVE LINEMEN — </b>G Dariusz Bladek, G Philip Blake, C Dan Clark, T Takoby Cofield*, T Thaddeus Coleman*, OL Jeremy Zver.</p>
      <p><b><b>The skinny:</b> </b><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-dan-clark-doesnt-take-o-line-award-for-granted">Clark was named a CFL all-star for the first time in his eight-year CFL career and is likely to return to his hometown Riders.</a> Bladek began the season as a starter, but was bumped to backup status with the returns of Blake and Brendon LaBatte from injuries. Bladek is still valuable, but may be looking elsewhere for an opportunity to start. Cofield, 27, battled injuries in 2019 and was supplanted by Terran Vaughn at left tackle. Coleman performed admirably at right tackle, but is 34. The Riders could re-sign Cofield as his replacement. Blake bounced back from a broken leg to close out the season. He’s also 34 and Dakoda Shepley is ready to be a full-time starter in his second season with the Riders.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s available: </b>Stanley Bryant and Jermarcus Hardrick, two tackles who helped the Blue Bombers win the Grey Cup, could both be available. Bryant was the runner-up to Chris Van Zeyl (Hamilton) for the most outstanding offensive lineman award.</p>
      <p><b>DEFENSIVE LINEMEN — </b>DE Lavar Edwards*, DE Chad Geter*, DT Makana Henry, DT Micah Johnson*, DE A.C. Leonard*, DE Jordan Reaves.</p>
      <p><b>The skinny: </b>Leonard was second on the Riders with nine sacks. Johnson was the CFL’s highest paid defender at $250,000 per season, a figure that was based on a 2018 season in which he had 14 sacks as a defensive tackle with Calgary. Johnson had only four sacks in 2019, but did come on in the second half of the season. The Riders may consider re-signing him, but at a reduced salary.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s available:</b> Defensive end Willie Jefferson (Winnipeg) heads the list after being named the league’s most outstanding defensive player. With Saskatchewan’s Charleston Hughes signed for the 2020 season, the Riders are unlikely to be interested in Jefferson. Dylan Wynn (Hamilton) could draw the Riders’ interest. A CFL all-star defensive tackle, he had 11 sacks during the regular season.</p>
      <p><b>LINEBACKERS — </b>Brandyn Bartlett, DyShawn Davis*, Solomon Elimimian*, Alexandre Gagne, Sam Hurl, Cameron Judge, Derrick Moncrief*.</p>
      <p><b>The skinny: </b>Judge and Moncrief may draw NFL interest, which would mean openings at their outside linebacker positions. A calf injury sidelined the 33-year-old Elimimian for training camp and the first three games of the regular season, but he still led the Riders with 88 defensive tackles and four sacks.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s available:</b> Larry Dean (Edmonton) was fourth in the CFL with 86 defensive tackles and a West Division all-star.</p>
      <p><b>DEFENSIVE BACKS — </b>Denzel Radford, Elie Bouka, Ed Gainey*, Nick Marshall*.</p>
      <p><b>The skinny: </b>Marshall, who led the Riders with five interceptions, is among the league’s best cornerbacks and is reportedly interested in testing the NFL waters. Gainey hasn’t come close to the 10 picks he recorded in 2017, but remains a solid contributor.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s available:</b> Winston Rose (Winnipeg) led the league with nine interceptions and could be a suitable replacement for Marshall. Frankie Williams (Hamilton) didn’t have any picks, but was named the CFL’s most outstanding special-teams player due to his explosiveness as a returner.</p>
      <p><b>SPECIAL TEAMS — </b>Jon Ryan (punter), Jorgen Hus (long snapper).</p>
      <p><b>The skinny: </b>Regina-born Ryan set a Riders record by averaging 48.8 yards per punt. Hus was limited to snapping on punts this season, while Gagne handled the snaps on placements.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s available:</b> Richie Leone (Ottawa) was second in the CFL with an average of 48.4 yards per punt en route to being named a CFL all-star. He led league in net punting average (38.1 yards), compared to Ryan’s net of 33.1 yards.</p>
