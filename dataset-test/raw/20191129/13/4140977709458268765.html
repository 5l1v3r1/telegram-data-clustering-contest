                      <h3>Nuno Espirito Santo</h3>

                          <p>Unai Emery’s sacking was, but a matter of time. People had already been talking about his possible exit and the man pipped to replace him was Wolverhampton manager Nuno Espirito Santo. With the job now vacant, it is very likely that Arsenal will want to make contact with him.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>Nuno does not have the experience of leading a club as huge as Arsenal. However, his efforts with Wolves speak for themselves. Last season, the team was performing above their weight and had an impressive record against the top 6 clubs.</p>
                            <p>Wolves also secured a place in European football last season and sit at 5<sup>th</sup> place in the Premier League this season; above Manchester United, Tottenham and Arsenal. Although, it is likely that he may not want to leave Wolves in the middle of the season especially when they’re doing so well right now.</p>
                            <p>Earlier in the week, Nuno was fielded a question about the possibility of him taking the top job at north London. However, the Portuguese refused to give a direct answer and instead replied rather cryptically. <i>“You know me well enough and you know I’m not going to answer that,”</i> he said.</p>
