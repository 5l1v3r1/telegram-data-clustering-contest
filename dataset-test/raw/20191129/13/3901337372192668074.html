      <p>In an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma, Mamelodi Sundowns defender, Rivaldo Coetzee opened up about his relationship with Pitso Mosimane. </p>
      <p>If there was one man who believed in Coetzee’s miraculous recovery, it has to be the Sundowns’ head coach, after he continued to show faith in the player despite an injury, which kept him on the sidelines for the entire 2017/18 season. </p>

      <p>Coetzee has come from a disappointing time in his career, after a move to Scottish giants, Glasgow Celtic fell through due to an underlying foot injury that was picked up during his medical.</p>
      <p>However, after months of medical attention and rehabilitation, Coetzee made an unexpected return to football in December 2018, where has since established himself as a key player in Head Coach Mosimane’s set-up when fit. </p>
      <p>Speaking in this week’s edition of Soccer Laduma, the player opened up about the type of relationship that he has with Mosimane and how the head coach helps him to improve his game.</p>
      <p>“We have a good relationship. He will criticise you when he needs to, which is also good for us. We do analysis and corrections in our games and he will advise on what I can improve on. For instance, from your previous game, he will come tell you that you need to improve on this or that, so it’s helping me a lot. Even coach Manqoba (Mngqithi), he and I speak quite a lot, so he has been helping me also. It has been good so far,” he said. </p>
