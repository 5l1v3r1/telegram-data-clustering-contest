      <h1>Court hears Craig McLachlan’s offensive alleged text to victim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:16:45+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/caroline-schelle/" target="_blank">Caroline Schelle</a></address>
      <p>Award-winning actor Craig McLachlan allegedly texted one of his colleagues urging her to come back to a show because he didn’t like the odour of another actress’ genitals.</p>
      <p>The actor faces multiple charges including of indecent assault, one of attempted indecent assault and others related to four victims that coincided with the <i>Rocky Horror Show</i> production.</p>
      <p>“He told her he did not like the hygiene of his co-star,” the victim’s friend and a theatre producer told a Melbourne court on Friday.</p>
      <p>McLachlan allegedly said via texts that the woman’s “vagina smelt” and he wanted the alleged victim to come back to the musical, the court was told.</p>
      <p>In other texts aired in the court, the alleged victim messaged her friend saying she was having nightmares about the actor.</p>
      <p>“I had a nightmare about Craig McLachlan last night and it made me wake up thinking of all the rocky s–t again,” the victim texted to her friend in October 2014.</p>
      <p>This was months after the run of the show had ended.</p>
      <p>McLachlan’s lawyer Stuart Littlemore QC previously said<a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/11/18/craig-mclachlan-court-hearing/"> the actor is pleading not guilty</a> to the charges.</p>
      <p>He will argue that some of the alleged incidents didn’t occur, while others weren’t indecent.</p>
      <p>The four alleged victims will give evidence about the incidents in a closed court.</p>
      <p>McLachlan became a household name for roles in the soap operas <i>Neighbours</i> and <i>Home and Away</i>.</p>
      <p>As well as various Logies, in 2015 he won the Helpmann Award for best male actor in a musical.</p>
      <p>The actor launched defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media, the ABC and a former co-star in 2018 but that case has been delayed until after the criminal charges are dealt with.</p>
