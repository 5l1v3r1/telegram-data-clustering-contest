      <p>Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan wants Emmanuel Macron to "have his own brain death checked out first" before criticizing NATO.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Istanbul's Marmara University on Friday, Erdoğan hit out at the French president over Macron's claim that the alliance was suffering from "brain death."</p>
      <p>"The French president's statements are examples of a diseased, shallow understanding. What's he saying? That NATO has experienced brain death. Mr. Macron, look, I appeal to you from Turkey, I will also say it at NATO, have your own brain death checked out first," Erdoğan said, according to a transcript of the speech published by <a href="https://www.trthaber.com/haber/gundem/cumhurbaskani-erdogandan-macrona-tepki-once-sen-kendi-beyin-olumunu-bir-kontrol-ettir-443701.html">state broadcaster TRT</a>.</p>
      <p>The Turkish president had previously <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/turkeys-erdogan-calls-macrons-nato-comments-unacceptable-204253255.html">denounced</a> Macron's "brain death" remarks as "unacceptable."</p>
      <p>Erdoğan on Friday also appeared to comment on Macron's assertion, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-my-brain-death-diagnosis-gave-nato-a-wake-up-call/">made in a press conference</a> with the alliance's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday, that terrorism — not Russia or China — is NATO's common enemy.</p>
      <p>"Macron doesn't know what the fight against terror is," the Turkish leader said, before adding, without elaborating further, that "that's why the Yellow Jackets invaded."</p>
      <p>He went on to criticize France's presence in Syria, and said: "We don't know what France means for NATO, but Turkey is NATO's most important member."</p>
      <p>NATO leaders are meeting in London for a summit next week.</p>
      <p>Macron, who sharply condemned Turkey's recent incursion into northern Syria, attempted to soften his position on that front on Thursday by saying he respects "the security interests of our Turkish ally."</p>
      <p>But Ankara was not impressed.</p>
      <p>"[Macron] is already the sponsor of the terrorist organization and constantly hosts them at the Elysée," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50584935">told reporters</a>, a reference to Macron meeting with representatives of Syrian Kurdish fighters that Turkey considers to be terrorists.</p>
