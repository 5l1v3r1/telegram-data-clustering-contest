        <b>DOHA (Sputnik) - The members of the Houthi movement, operating in Yemen, have shot down a Saudi helicopter near the border with Saudi Arabia, Yahya Sarea, the group's military spokesman, said on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Yemeni air defences have been able, thanks to God, to shoot down a Saudi Apache aircraft with a new surface-to-air missile, which we will reveal later," Sarea said in a statement, as quoted by Yemeni Almasirah media network.</blockquote>
      <p>The incident is said to have occurred near the border with the Saudi region of Asir, which borders the northern part of Yemen.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia hasn't confirmed the claims yet.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the month, the Houthi militia claimed that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911201077363149-saudi-led-coalition-spokesman-refutes-houthi-claim-of-downing-f-15-warplane---spa/">they had "intercepted" an F-15 jet</a> belonging to a Saudi-led coalition member force. A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen, Lt. Col. Turki Al-Maliki, however, refuted the claims later.</p>
      <p>Yemen has been engulfed in an armed conflict between the government forces, led by President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi, and the rebel Houthi movement for several years now. A Saudi-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthis at Hadi's request since March 2015.</p>
