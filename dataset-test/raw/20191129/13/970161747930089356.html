      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liverpool-fc/">Liverpool</a> have confirmed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> will miss the rest of 2019 after suffering ankle ligament damage.</p>
      <p>Fabinho limped off against Napoli during the week and there were immediate fears the Brazilian <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/27/jurgen-klopp-provides-fabinho-injury-update-liverpools-draw-napoli-11230957/">could miss as much as six weeks of action</a>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool welcome Brighton and Hove Albion to Anfield at the weekend, a game Fabinho was already suspended for.</p>
      <p>But the influential midfielder will miss the entirety of Liverpool’s jam-packed festive period and will not make his injury comeback until after the New Year.</p>

      <p>‘Losing a player like Fabinho is massive,’ Klopp ahead of Liverpool’s game this weekend.</p>
      <p>‘We are not sure how long it will take but it looks pretty sure he will not be involved in the Christmas fixtures.</p>
      <p>‘We have solutions for the position. We have to replace him and we will play without him. It’s important he does the right things and be back as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>‘We have to find solutions. We are not the only team with injured players. We have to deal with it and we will.’</p>
      <p>Fabinho will miss the Merseyside derby against Everton next week, the Champions League decider against RB Salzburg, the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa and a crucial Premier League clash with Leicester City.</p>
      <p>Liverpool first game in January is a home match against Sheffield United on 2 January before a big game against Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham the following week.</p>
