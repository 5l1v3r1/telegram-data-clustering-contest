        <b>Dean Smith hopes to re-establish Aston Villa as “a top Premier League club” after extending his contract.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aston Villa head coach Dean Smith has signed a new four-year contract with the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old, who took charge in 2018, has now agreed terms that tie him to his boyhood club until 2023.</p>
      <p>“I’m really happy to have committed my long-term future to the club,” Smith told Villa’s website.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to all the challenges that come with re-establishing Aston Villa as a top Premier League club.”</p>
      <p>Villa CEO Christian Purslow added: “The board is delighted that Dean has signed a new four-year contract which puts him at the heart of the club’s long-term rebuilding plans.”</p>
      <p>Smith took charge of Villa in October last year and guided them to promotion back to the Premier League via a Championship play-off final win over Derby County.</p>
      <p>With four wins from their first 13 top-flight games of the season, Villa are four points above the relegation zone in 15th place.</p>
      <p>They take on Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
