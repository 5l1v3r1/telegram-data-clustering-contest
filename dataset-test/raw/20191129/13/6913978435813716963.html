      <p><b>KABUL — </b>The Taliban said Friday it was "way too early" to speak of resuming direct talks with Washington, a day after President Donald Trump suggested negotiations to end America's longest war were back on track during a surprise visit to Afghanistan.<br/><br/>The statement from insurgent spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid sounded a note of caution after Trump said during a lightning visit to Bagram Airfield Thursday that the Taliban "wants to make a deal".<br/><br/>"We're meeting with them and we're saying it has to be a ceasefire," he told reporters during the visit to mark the Thanksgiving holiday with troops at the base.<br/><br/>His statement indicated progress, though Mujahid's suggested roadblocks remain.<br/><br/>"It is way too early to talk about the resumption of talks for now," the insurgent spokesman told AFP in a WhatsApp message, adding that the Islamist group would give an official reaction later.<br/><br/>In September the US and the Taliban had appeared on the verge of signing a deal that would have seen Washington begin pulling troops out of Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.<br/><br/>It was also expected to pave the way towards direct talks between the Taliban and the government in Kabul.<br/><br/>But that month Trump abruptly called the year-long effort "dead", and withdrew an invitation to the insurgents to meet in the United States due to the killing of an American soldier.<br/><br/>"We were getting close and we pulled back. We didn't want to do it because of what they did," Trump said at Bagram during a meeting with Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, referring to the death of the soldier.<br/><br/>"Since then, we've hit them so hard, they've never been hit this hard," he added.<br/><br/>Most observers agree that a political settlement is the only way towards a lasting peace in Afghanistan, and since September diplomatic efforts to foster dialogue have continued.<br/><br/>The Taliban last week handed over two hostages — an American and an Australian — after three years in captivity in exchange for three high-ranking insurgent prisoners, a move seen as a boost to resuming negotiations.<br/><br/>About 13,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan, 18 years after the United States invaded following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.<br/><br/>Trump said he planned to reduce the number to 8,600, and later added "we can go much further than that," without giving details.<br/><br/>The president also said Thursday the war in Afghanistan "will not be decided on the battlefield" and that "ultimately there will need to be a political solution" decided by people in the region.<br/><br/>The insurgents have long refused to talk to Kabul, however, declaring the administration a "puppet" of the US.<br/><br/>A simmering political crisis over the most recent Afghan presidential election will not help.<br/><br/>The Sept. 28 poll has already been marred by a record-low turnout and bickering between the incumbent, Ghani, and his chief rival, Abdullah Abdullah.<br/><br/>Two months later, election officials have not yet released even a preliminary count. Without a result, it is not yet clear whether it will be Ghani or Abdullah who eventually faces the militants across the negotiating table.<br/><br/>A ceasefire could also be part of the delay. "That would be a major shift in policy. Violence is leverage for the Taliban," tweeted the Wilson Center's South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.<br/><br/>Meanwhile ordinary Afghans continue to bear the brunt of the conflict, with more civilians killed in 2018 than during any other year on record, according to the United Nations. — AFP</p>
