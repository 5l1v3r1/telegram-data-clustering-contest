      <p>For $399, the LG G8 ThinQ is a really good <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">smartphone</a> to pick up. That's more than half off of its regular price, and this is actually a flagship smartphone.</p>
      <p>LG launched the G8 ThinQ earlier this year, so it has all of the latest specs that you would expect from a flagship smartphone. That includes a Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>
      <p>There is also a dual-camera setup on the backside. There's an ultrawide 12-megapixel camera and a regular 16-megapixel sensor. It decided to keep the telephoto lens on its V-series smartphones, at least for now. Which is fine, as most people are going to prefer the Ultrawide over the telephoto anyways. Even though Google says we don't.</p>

      <p>The screen on the LG G8 ThinQ is a 6.1-inch Quad HD+ OLED panel, which looks pretty incredible. Now there is a notch here, and it is a pretty large one. Though thankfully it's not as deep as the Pixel 3 XL's notch was. It is still pretty long. That's because it houses the front-facing camera, as well as a Time of Flight sensor for some cool gestures and better selfies.</p>
      <p>The speaker on the G8 ThinQ is actually under the display, and you won't even notice a difference here. It's actually really good. So there's still stereo speakers on the G8 ThinQ, even though there is actually only one speaker you can see – on the bottom of the device.</p>
      <p>LG G8 ThinQ is an unlocked smartphone and it also works with all four of the US carriers. That includes AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. So all you need to do is pop in your SIM card and you're all set.</p>
