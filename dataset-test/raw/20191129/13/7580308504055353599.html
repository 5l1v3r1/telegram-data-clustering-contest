      <p>Namibia’s President Hage Geingob on Friday looked set to secure a second term with partial results from this week’s general election showing him leading with 55 percent of the vote.</p>
      <p>The southwestern African country held its sixth presidential and parliamentary elections on Wednesday amid economic woes and growing frustration against the regime.</p>
      <p>Geingob’s South West Africa People’s (SWAPO) party has been in power since Namibia’s independence from South Africa in 1990 and is widely hailed for its role in the liberation struggle.</p>
      <p>But the president — who was elected with a sweeping 87 percent majority in 2014 — is predicted to lose a share of votes to a breakaway SWAPO member running as an independent candidate, former dentist Panduleni Itula.</p>
      <p>The breakaway candidate is particularly popular among youth frustrated by the lack of jobs and too young to remember the SWAPO-led war for independence.</p>
      <p>Partial results published by the Electoral Commission of Namibia after half the votes were counted showed Geingob leading with 55.04 percent, followed by Itula with 29.72 percent.</p>
      <p>SWAPO was also ahead in parliament with 65.57 percent of votes.</p>
      <p>The party’s long-standing opponent, the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), was in second place with 15.6 percent.</p>
      <p>PDM candidate and second-time runner McHenry Venaani was third in the presidential race with 5.17 percent of votes.</p>
      <p>Election commission chief Theo Mujoro said a date for the announcement of final results would be determined on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Around 1.4 million of Namibia’s 2.45 million population were registered to vote. Half were under 37 and around a third born after 1990.</p>
      <p>The election was “generally peaceful, well organised and conducted in a professional manner,” the Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional bloc said Friday.</p>
      <p>Namibia was the first country in Africa to introduce electronic voting machines in 2014.</p>
      <p>The machines — opposed by opposition parties fearing the lack of paper could facilitate fraud — were meant to accelerate the voting and counting process.</p>
      <p>But the voting process was painfully sluggish and had people queueing outside for hours.</p>
      <p>SADC recommended better training and “voter education” around the use of these machines.</p>
