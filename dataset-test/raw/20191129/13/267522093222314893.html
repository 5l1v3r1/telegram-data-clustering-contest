      <h1>Save up to £5,000 on Cartier and Audemars Piguet watches in the Goldsmiths Black Friday sale</h1>
      <h2>These pre-owned luxury watches are heavily discounted and come with a two-year warranty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:51:05+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Charlton</a></address>
      <p>Buying second-hand might not be for everyone, but when it comes to these luxury Swiss watches – which have been discounted by up to £5,000 – we reckon we can change your mind.</p>
      <p>Both are offered by Goldsmiths and, most importantly, both come with a two-year warranty for peace of mind.</p>
      <p>First up is a beautiful Audemars Piguet Jules men's watch. This Swiss-made timepiece features a 36mm case made from white gold, with a silver dial and sapphire crystal glass; it is water-resistant to 30 metres.</p>

      <p>The watch is powered by a manually-wound mechanical movement and comes fitted to a new black leather strap with a buckle clasp. The simple timepiece has elegant hour and minute hands, with a second complication installed at the six o'clock position.</p>
      <p>The price of the watch has been discounted by Goldsmiths from £7,995 to £6,396, and it is also available for £120.82 per month at 9.9% APR. A branded box is included.</p>
      <p>Next up is an equally beautiful Cartier Ballon Bleu men's watch. This watch has a larger 46mm stainless steel case with silver dial and sapphire crystal glass.</p>
      <p>The watch is powered by a hand-wound mechanical movement and is water-resistant to 30 metres. The watch comes with its original inner branded box, and a non-branded cushion. It has been fitted with a new black leather strap.</p>
      <p>Setting this watch apart is how the crown is protected by a bezel which wraps itself around it, while the dial features Roman numerals and a pair of simple blue hour and minute hands.</p>
      <p>Goldsmiths is offering this watch at £7,995, a huge saving on its previous price of £12,995. It can also be had from £151.02 per month. The watch also comes with a two-year warranty.</p>
      <p>Both of these watches have been put through a five-stage test to ensure they are up to scratch. This includes full assessment confirming their authenticity, a full ultrasonic case and polish of the case and bracelet, a diagnostics test to ensure everything is working correctly, a time regulation and power reserve test, and a water resistance test on the glass, crown and back seals.</p>
