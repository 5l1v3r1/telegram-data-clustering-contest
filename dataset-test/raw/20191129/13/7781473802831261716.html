      <h1>Upcoming Skoda Kamiq SUV spotted testing in India for the first time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:45:36+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Skoda India has begun testing the Skoda Kamiq mid-sized SUV in India. This makes us think that the first SUV for India under the Idia 2.0 plan could be a heavily loclaised version of the Kamiq or another SUV very closely related to it. Bernhard Maier, Skoda Auto CEO, recently confirmed that an SUV will be the first product of the new product onslaught, so this assumption doesn't seem too far fetched.</p>

      <p>The Kamiq seen here seemed to be in the early stages of its conversion to its India specification with Skoda's European officials onboard the car. As far as looks are concerned this SUV seems very similar to the one sold in Europe. It gets the two-part headlamp cluster, a theme now quite common in SUVs, but with the distinctive progressive indicators previously seen on Audis. The Kamiq's design is typically Skoda. It gets the same simple lines and prominent surfaces that <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/2019-skoda-scala-premium-hatchback-unveiled-internationally/">we have seen on the Scala hatchback</a>. The side profile shows a large angular glass area and the unique sloping roof. A unique touch is the quarter-glass on the wide C-pillar. The rear gets a split tail lamp treatment with the now truncated C signature, another Skoda design staple. There's body-cladding throughout, and what looks like 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>

      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/news/geneva-motor-show-2019-skoda-kamiq-suv-interior-design-revealed/">The design of the interiors follows the simple but subtly sylish theme of previous Skoda.</a> The contrasting elements bring more excitement here. The Virtual Cockpit instrument cluster makes its way here as does a 9.2 inch infotainment screen. Further, all the unique touches which make the Kodiaq so functional, like the door-sill protetctors and umbrella holders are also available on the Kamiq. European cars also get heated front and rear seats, steering wheel and windscreen. The Indian car will likely miss out on these, possibly being equipped with a feature set quite similsr to the Octavia.</p>

      <p>There are three petrol options available on the Kamiq in Europe starting with a 95PS 1.0 TSI, a 115PS version of the same motor and going up to a 1.5 TSI with 150PS. The diesel engine will be a 1.6 TDI with 115PS and 250Nm. For India, the 1.0-litre with 115PS and 200 Nm and the 1.5-litre petrol with 150PS and 250 Nm seem most likely.</p>
      <p>The Indian-built Skoda Kamiq will most likely go up against the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/kia/seltos-m782/">Kia Seltos</a>, the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mg/hector-m758/">MG Hector</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/tata/harrier-m716/">Tata Harrier</a> and the new <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/creta-m418/">Hyundai Creta</a> that is also being readied for an Auto Expo 2020 debut. The Kamiq is expected to be priced slightly higher than the Kia and Hyundai cars, starting around the Rs 11 to 12 lakh mark.</p>
