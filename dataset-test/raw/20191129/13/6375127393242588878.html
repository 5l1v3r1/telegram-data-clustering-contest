      <p> <br/><b>Specs of Trading in a “Sleeping” Market</b></p>
      <p>If you want to make money or avoid losses of finance, be ready to adjust your trading approach to the current market state where you are operating on. Thus, trading on a low-liquidity market is directly related to the Inplay strategy, but it is more highly specialized. The approach is more focused not on intraday levels but on trends that stretch from previous days and are noticeable on more global timeframes.</p>

      <p>The essence of trading in an illiquid market is the existence of signals that are impossible to hide. The crowd is not able to greatly impact the market because it is always a few steps behind large players. Any mathematical change in dynamics may indicate that a large institutional is present in the stack. For a trader, this is a clear signal to enter the stock.</p>
      <p>The period when liquidity falls on the market is one of the most unstable for a day trader. After all, the ideal situation for trading is when news related to the company’s activity is regularly released or when a crisis occurs either locally or globally. All these make the stock change. Thus, the strategy of trading in a “sleeping” market is to select stocks that show dynamics. With a relevant stock and strategy, a trader will have stable earnings regardless of the state of the market.</p>
