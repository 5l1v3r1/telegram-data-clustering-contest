        <i><b>Finborough, London<br/></b>A Welsh teenager is hailed as the second coming in this fascinating revival of Emlyn Williams’ long-forgotten play</i>
      </p>
      <p>This enterprising theatre struck gold in 2011 with its revival of Emlyn Williams’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/04/accolade-review-finborough-theatre">Accolade</a>. They now turn to an earlier Williams work, unseen since its London premiere in 1945, that deals with an outbreak of religious fervour in a Welsh mountain village just after the Crimean war. It’s a weird piece, chiefly fascinating today for what it reveals about Williams himself.</p>
      <p>He originally played the pivotal figure of Ambrose Ellis, a renegade Welshman who owns a circus in Birmingham and is drawn back to his birthplace by rumours of magic and music in the air. He discovers that a 13-year-old boy is believed to have miraculous powers, which include curing a cholera epidemic, and is thought to be the new Christ. Having arrived as an exploitative businessman, Ellis turns into a dedicated evangelist. Although Williams never explains the credulity of the villagers, the play is intriguing as an exploration of his own guilt: you feel that Williams, who as a successful actor and writer became part of the showbiz world, is expressing his own nostalgia for the Welsh landscape and language, and conceivably his search for a lost faith.</p>
      <p>Will Maynard’s production shrewdly reinforces that feeling by suggesting a post-second world war setting. The performances are also impeccable. Jamie Wilkes as Ellis switches plausibly from sharp-suited showman to devoted disciple and is staunchly supported by David Whitworth as his watchful sidekick, by Rhiannon Neads as a widowed sceptic turned true believer and by Louise Breckon-Richards as the loving mother of the boy messiah. It’s not my favourite Williams piece but it fully deserves revival.</p>
