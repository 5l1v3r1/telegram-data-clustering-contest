      <p>After beating fellow strugglers Norwich before the international break to haul themselves off the bottom of the table, the Hornets were handed a reality check after a sobering 3-0 home defeat by Burnley.</p>
      <p>Watford head to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/southampton/"><b>Southampton</b></a> on eight points, but are just one behind their hosts and the current gap to West Ham in 17th stands at five.</p>
      <p>Sanchez Flores, though, is not about to spend hours trying to calculate what tally could see them safe come May, and instead will focus on producing a winning formula.</p>
      <p>"Someone told me that Burnley last year on December 26 had 12 points in 19 games â€“ and in the end, they stayed up really well," the Spaniard said.</p>
      <p>"But I am not doing this kind of count, it would be crazy to.</p>
      <p>"If you lose your time doing maths it would be crazy. I have a lot of things to do with the team."</p>
      <p>The Watford boss added at a press conference: "Be positive, there is time, there is time for the next match, time for the future because we have many matches to play.</p>
      <p>"It's not the end of the season. If we are able to win, we need to start working again.</p>
      <p>"The most difficult thing is not to win one, but it is to win and win again and again and again."</p>
      <p>Sanchez Flores returned to the club for a second spell when he replaced Javier Gracia in early September.</p>
      <p>While his own position continues to be the subject of much speculation, the Spaniard is ready to meet the challenges head on.</p>
      <p>"The situation is obviously not comfortable. It's uncomfortable, it's difficult and we can't relax," Sanchez Flores said.</p>
      <p>"We need to go one step more, one step up. We need to bring back the good feelings we had for the games against Tottenham and Norwich.</p>
      <p>"We need to be focused with no distractions and concentrate on the work we are doing.</p>
      <p>"It's the only way we can do this if we want to change the situation. The only thing we can do is fight and fight a lot."</p>
      <p>Southampton were close to securing a first Premier League win since mid-September at Arsenal before Alexandre Lacazette struck deep into stoppage-time to salvage a 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p>Sanchez Flores hopes a positive result for themselves at St Mary's Stadium could prove a turning point, but will not underestimate the threat of Ralph Hasenhuttl's side.</p>
      <p>"We know they are dangerous, they have very quick players, good players in the midfield, strong defenders," the Watford manager said.</p>
      <p>"But we have our players too, we have things we want to do. It should be even, like every single match in the Premier League."</p>
