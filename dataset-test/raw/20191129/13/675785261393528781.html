      <h1>Boris Johnson forced to clarify his defence of monarchy in Prince Andrew scandal</h1>
      <h2>The Tory leader said 10 days ago the monarchy was 'beyond reproach' - but now he's made clear he was only talking about the Queen, not the entire royal family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:33:05+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson has been forced to clarify his defence of the monarchy amid the scandal over Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>The PM was branded 'unforgivable' by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> after he offered up the surprising comment on the Duke of York's friendship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Esptein.</p>
      <p>But questioned by journalists today, he had to clarify his comments - saying he was only talking about the <i><b>monarchy,</b> </i>not the entire royal family.</p>
      <p>While he still did not criticise Prince Andrew, Mr Johnson's comment finally makes clear he was not endorsing the Duke - 10 days after he was asked.</p>
      <p>The original clash happened during an ITV debate between him and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>Asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose, long-time Republican Mr Corbyn said: "Needs a bit of improvement."</p>

      <p>Yet Mr Johnson said defiantly: "The institution of the Monarchy is beyond reproach”.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister, who said in August he has "seen the good" Prince Andrew can do, added at the time: "All our sympathies should be obviously with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>"And the law must certainly take its course".</p>
      <p>Since then, Prince Andrew has been stripped of many of his royal duties after a disastrous Newsnight interview in which he showed no remorse for his friendship with Epstein.</p>

      <p>Today, Mr Johnson looked to explain his comment that the monarchy was "beyond reproach". </p>
      <p>The PM said: "On the monarchy, the monarchy is the Queen.</p>
      <p>"That in my view, she is beyond reproach. There is a distinction between the monarchy and the royal family and everybody will readily appreciate that.</p>
      <p>"It is an obvious definitional (sic) distinction."</p>
