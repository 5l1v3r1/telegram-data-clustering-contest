      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/megan-barton/">Megan Barton</a> Hanson was made an ambassador of Ann Summers’ Pleasure Project <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/17/megan-barton-hanson-happy-see-maura-higgins-open-sex-flutters-love-island-10760883/">thanks to her openness about sexuality and sex.</a></p>
      <p>And that role of course involves the all-important flogging of Black Friday deals.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the annual sales bonanza, Megan made a surprise appearance at Ann Summers in Westfield Stratford, totally slaying in a pair of skintight black PVC trousers.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old teamed the pants with a black lace halterneck bodysuit with corset detailing, making her underwear outerwear.</p>

      <p>Well, what’s the point in wearing beautiful lingerie if you can’t show it off, eh?</p>
      <p>The Love Island star posed alongside underwear and stockings in store, as well as modelling next to a poster of her wearing a racy sheer bodysuit.</p>

      <p>Megan, who is bisexual, was snapped up by the lingerie and sex toy brand thanks to her refreshing attitude towards female pleasure, and has spoken about closing the ‘orgasm gap.</p>
      <p>Apparently, women have 1,734 orgasms less orgasms than men in their lifetime, with just 65% of heterosexual women orgasm every time they have sex compared to 95% of straight men.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Grazia, the reality star said: ‘Sex has never been off-limits or a taboo subject for me to talk about, even with my mum.</p>
      <p>‘It was such a shock for me that on the show I got so much stick and abuse for sleeping with two different boys. After that I just really want girls to feel empowered about their sexuality and bridge the gap between men and women.’</p>
      <p>However, Megan, who is dating singer-songwriter Chelcee Grimes, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/megan-barton-hanson-cant-even-look-d-bisexual-star-rules-dating-men-11180037/">claims she won’t be going back to men for a while.</a></p>

      <p>Speaking on The Truth Flirts podcast, hosted by Mel B in partnership with Badoo, the 25-year-old said: ‘I can’t ever see myself getting back with a guy. Even now when I watch porn, it’s only lesbian porn, I can’t even look at a d***.’</p>
