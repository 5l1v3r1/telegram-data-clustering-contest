      <p>Emmerdale actress Samantha Giles revealed to This Morning viewers she is a real life witch.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old spoke about casting spells and harnessing the power of nature after talking about her departure from the ITV soap.</p>
      <p>Samantha, a mum-of-two, said it was time for a new adventure as we said goodbye to her character Bernice Blackstock last night.</p>
      <p>But presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruthl angsford wanted to know more about her spirituality.</p>

      <p>Eamonn confessed he was really interested in witchcraft, and said: " Here is what Samantha did, Samanatha put a love spell on the man she is married to so that they would be attracted, is that right?</p>
      <p>She said: "Well, I didn't actually put it on him, I did a love spell to ask the universe for the right person to come along.</p>
      <p>"I didn't put any names in any mix, because you can't specify somebody, you can write down the traits that you want them to have, the attributes you think are important, but you can't say 'I want that person to fall in love with me'."</p>
      <p>Eamonn said: "And Sharon Marshall [This Morning's soap correspondent] credits you with her being a mummy."</p>

      <p>Samantha said: "Well, I gave her a change of luck charm, which she used to to help along the IVF."</p>
      <p>Eamonn said: "So are you an official witch? I mean, my wife is a witch, but that is unofficial. She is of the black variety, black witch. Are you a white witch?"</p>
      <p>Samantha said: "Well, there is no such thing really as black or white witch, basically in Wicca you are harnessing nature, the power of nature really to ask for the things that you want.</p>
      <p>"If you tried to do a bad spell, or had bad intentions, it just comes back on you three-fold."</p>
      <p>She added: "I have always been interested in that [Wicca] and that is kind of what has inspired me in a way to write my first children's book all about witches and magic."</p>
      <p>Samantha said she has finished with Emmerdale for now, but did remind fans the door is open for her return.</p>
