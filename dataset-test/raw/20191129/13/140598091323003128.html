      <p>A really soft, moist cake. If you’re making this for people with nut allergies, swap the almonds for the same amount of gluten-free flour. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 25 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>45 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>eight </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>225g butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing the tin</li>
        <li>145g desiccated coconut</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lime and finely grated zest of 3</li>
        <li>100g ground almonds</li>
        <li>125g gluten-free plain flour (I use Doves Farm)</li>
        <li>2 ½ tsp gluten-free baking powder</li>
        <li>225g caster sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sour cream</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp milk (as needed)</li>
        <li>Icing sugar, for dusting</li>
        <li>Toasted coconut flakes, lime slices and zest, to decorate</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/ 170C fan*/gas mark 4. Butter a 20-21cm springform cake tin and line the base.</li>
        <li>Put the desiccated coconut in a bowl and add 150ml boiling water. Leave to soak for 15 minutes, then add the lime juice. Mix together the almonds, flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugar in an electric mixer until creamy and fluffy. Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well after each addition (for best results, don’t go too fast). Add the lime zest and sour cream.</li>
        <li>Fold the nut and flour mixture into the batter in three batches, then stir in the coconut (which should have soaked up the water). Add enough milk to give you a dropping consistency.</li>
        <li>Scrape the batter into the cake tin and bake for about 45 minutes. Push a skewer into the centre of the cake – it should come out clean.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool a little. Unclasp the side of the tin and very carefully remove the paper, then slide the cake on to a plate.</li>
        <li>Dust with icing sugar and decorate before serving with crème fraîche, the sorbet overleaf, or both.</li>
      </ol>
