        <b>Liverpool midfielder Fabinho will be out until next year with the ankle injury he suffered against Napoli.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Brazilian went off after 19 minutes of Wednesday's Champions League group game, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50519961">which the Reds drew 1-1</a>, after he fell awkwardly making a challenge.</p>
      <p>Liverpool said the 26-year-old had "suffered ankle ligament damage" and will be out "until the new year".</p>
      <p>"Losing a player of the quality of Fabinho is big. Really bad," said Reds manager Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>"It is bad news. Timeframe - we are not sure 100% but looks pretty sure he will not be involved in Christmas fixtures.</p>
      <p>"We have to replace him and we can replace him. Now it's important that he does the right things and is back as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>"Until then, we have to find solutions. We are not the only team with injured players and that's what we have to deal with, and we will."</p>
      <p>The Reds have 11 games over the next 34 days in the Premier League, Champions League, Carabao Cup and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50581762">Club World Cup</a>.</p>
      <p>Fabinho has started 12 out 13 league games this season and all five European fixtures.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League and host Brighton - a game Fabinho would have been suspended for anyway - on Saturday at 15:00 GMT.</p>
