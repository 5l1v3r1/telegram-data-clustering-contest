      <p>A former Labour MP who led the Vote Leave campaign, is urging Labour voters to back <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> in the election in order to ‘get <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> done’.</p>
      <p>Appearing alongside the Prime Minister and Michael Gove, her former Vote Leave colleagues, Gisela Stuart said: ‘I urge other Leave voters across the country to join me in voting for Brexit once more by voting for Boris Johnson on December 12, so that we can finish the job we have started so that we can get Brexit done and that we can take back control.’</p>
      <p>Ms Stuart also called the election a ‘Brexit election’ and said she would not be voting for Jeremy Corbyn, but she can vote for Brexit.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘This is after all the Brexit election, and a vote for Boris Johnson this time round is a vote to get Brexit done.’</p>

      <p>Ms Stuart said that supporting Boris Johnson would ‘not make a you a Tory’ but said that if ‘you voted leave, and you want to deliver this, then that is the only way to produce a clear majority.’</p>
      <p>She warned that if the country failed to seize the opportunity, then ‘Brexit will not happen’.</p>
      <p>Michael Gove told the audience that the failure to deliver Brexit was a ‘stain on the last Parliament’.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘People voted for change but three-and-a-half years on, that change still has not been delivered.</p>
      <p>‘That, sadly, will forever be a stain on the last Parliament and it should probe the conscience of the next.</p>
      <p>‘People are fed up with the stagnation of the last three years and the great risk at this election is another hung parliament, meaning more dither, delay and deadlock.’</p>
