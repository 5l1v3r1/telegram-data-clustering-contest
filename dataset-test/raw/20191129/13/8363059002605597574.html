      <h1>Court Says Royal Mail Staff's Christmas Strikes Can't Go Ahead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:40:24+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Cutlack</a></address>
      <p>Some complicated legal action has been underway in the case of the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/royal-mail-strikes/">Royal Mail Group versus its workers' union</a>, and the latest ruling from the wigs of justice says that strikes may not go ahead as the ballot of members was not carried out in the technically correct manner.</p>
      <p>Royal Mail bosses are well happy that strike action impacting our Christmas deliveries will not happen now, and said: "Royal Mail is pleased that the Court of Appeal has upheld the High Court's decision to grant an interim injunction against CWU meaning that no industrial action can be taken before the completion of a lawful ballot. This decision still stands."</p>
      <p>This latest legal twist involved the Communications Workers Union asking the Court of Appeal to overturn a previous interim injunction saying that strike action should be called off. The Court of Appeal rejected this request, so the High Court's earlier ruling that the strike action ballot was unlawful still stands; therefore an entirely new and fully compliant ballot of RMG staff members must be taken before strikes may be considered anew.
