      <p>When it comes to Windows Mixed Reality (WMR), Microsoft's own take on the VR experience, you can generally either go for a budget headset or a premium offering, including the likes of the HP Reverb or Samsung HMD Odyssey+. Now, thanks to a deep sale for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, the latter headset is <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU72069YYm%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fp%252Fsamsung-hmd-odyssey%252F8n2d0nk20p8m&amp;token=bYuMwHyu">available for just $229</a>, half of its regular price.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/should-you-buy-samsungs-new-hmd-odyssey-windows-mixed-reality-headset">Odyssey+</a> is a premium head-mounted display (HMD) with dual 3.5-inch AMOLED screens behind lenses that offer a 110-degree field-of-view (FOV). You get a combined resolution of 2880x1600 for a crisp picture, with Anti-SDE technology to remove the grid you often see overtop of a VR picture. Whereas the actual resolution offers 616 pixels-per-inch (ppi), you'll instead see something closer to 1,233 ppi.</p>
      <p>Compared to the standard Samsung Odyssey and other more budget-friendly WMR headsets, the Odyssey+ delivers superior comfort thanks to a wide nose guard and eye box. Your face won't feel nearly as cramped, and those who wear prescription frames should have an easier time fitting inside. Headphones are built onto the sides of the head straps for quality audio with no extra hardware required.</p>
      <p>Tracking is handled from the inside out thanks to built-in sensors on the headset, and two motion controllers are included in the package to offer input into the VR world. To get the best experience possible you'll likely want a high-performance PC, so be sure to check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-black-friday-laptop-deals">best Black Friday laptop deals</a>, including gaming laptops, while you wait for the Odyssey+ to ship.</p>
