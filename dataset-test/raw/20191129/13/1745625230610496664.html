      <h3>Check Out These Black Friday Laptop Deals On Amazon</h3>

      <p><a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is here, and for many shoppers, that means it’s time to replace that old <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/laptops">laptop</a> with a new one while potentially saving hundreds of dollars in the process. <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> is still one of the best places to shop for a laptop this holiday season. Whether it’s a discounted MacBook or a Windows-powered machine, the retail giant has several options to choose from, across all price points.</p>
      <p>As recapped in <i><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/best-black-friday-2019-laptop-deals-big-savings-apple-macbook-pro-samsung-more/">CNET</a></i>‘s list of Amazon laptop deals for Black Friday, Apple’s newest MacBook Air model is available for as low as $899.99, which represents a nearly $200 discount off of the Cupertino, California, company’s original price of $1,099. Buyers can also save an additional $100 by choosing “No-Rush” shipping — those willing to tough it out and get their MacBook Air a little later than usual can save just a little bit more, a sacrifice that might be worth it.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V1PHKPM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;ascsubtag=91c4ef26-17c3-4046-884e-7c6a90686823&amp;th=1&amp;tag=iq10101-20">Amazon</a>‘s listing, the above pricing applies to the 128GB version, though shoppers can also save close to $200 on the 256GB model — which usually costs $1,299 — at the Black Friday price of $1,099.99. This option, however, does not come with the same “No-Rush” shipping option that is available for the cheaper model. Both machines come with a 13-inch display, an eight-generation dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, and 8GB RAM.</p>
      <p>In relation to the above deal, the latest 13-inch <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5573319/apple-rumors-suggest-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-will-be-released-in-the-fall/">MacBook Pro</a> model is also available for $200 off the list price on Amazon — instead of paying $1,300, the machine is on sale for only $1,100 on Black Friday. Specifications include a quad-core Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 128GB storage.</p>

      <p>Moving on to Windows machines, Amazon is selling the LG Gram 14 as an option for shoppers who want a powerful laptop that’s lighter than most competing devices — this particular model is selling for $1,200, or $300 off full pricing. The Gram 14, true to its name, comes with a 14-inch display, with basic specifications that also include an Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD storage.</p>

      <p>Looking for a decent laptop on a tight budget? Per <i><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-black-friday-2019-laptop-deals/">ZDNet</a></i>, Amazon has a number of less expensive laptops on sale for Black Friday. These include the Acer Aspire 5 ($308, $41 off regular pricing) and the Aspire 1 ($230, $20 off), both of which come with 4GB RAM under the hood.</p>
      <p>Finally, those interested in an entry-level laptop that runs on Google’s Chrome OS can purchase the Dell Chromebook 11 for only $74 instead of the full price of $129. The Chromebook 11, as noted, features an 11.6-inch display, 2GB RAM, 16GB storage, and an Intel Celeron processor.</p>
