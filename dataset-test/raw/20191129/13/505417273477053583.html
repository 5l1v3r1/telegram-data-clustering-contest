        <b>Ireland international Bundee Aki has signed a contract extension with Connacht that will see him remain at the province until 2023.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aki’s current deal runs out in the summer and there was speculation that the star centre was considering a move abroad with a number of French teams thought to be sniffing around.</p>
      <p>However, the IRFU and Connacht have confirmed that the 29-year-old will remain in the west of Ireland having signed a new three-year deal.</p>
      <p>Aki first joined the province in 2014 and has since made 92 appearances, scoring 18 tries during that period. He was a central figure in 2015 when Connacht were crowned PRO12 champions and picked up the Pro12 Player of the Season award that year.</p>

      <p>“I am grateful for the opportunity I have been given to represent both Connacht and Ireland and am delighted to extend my IRFU contract.</p>
      <p>“The whole of Connacht have been incredibly supportive of both me and my family and the Ireland supporters have been fantastic from the very first day I was selected for the national squad.</p>
      <p>“Connacht has become home to me and my family and I want to play my part in helping Connacht achieve their ambitious plans in the years to come.”</p>

      <p>“He shares the ambition that we have for the seasons ahead and what he can achieve as a Connacht player. His commitment for a further three seasons is a sign of the energy and passion he has for the province”.</p>
