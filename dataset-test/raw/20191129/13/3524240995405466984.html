      <p>A man who attempted to murder a top Serbian businessman with close ties to President Aleksandar Vucic was jailed by a Belgrade court on Friday for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Milan Beko, a former minister, was seriously wounded when he was shot by a gunman in front of his house in the Serbian capital in November 2014.</p>
      <p>The court convicted Aleksandar Zdravkovic of attempted murder but cleared co-defendant Maja Adrovac of being his accomplice, state-run RTS television reported. The verdicts can be appealed.</p>
      <p>Beko, 58, was a minister in charge of privatisation in one of the governments of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
      <p>He was a member of the leftist JUL party of Milosevic’s wife Mira Markovic.</p>
      <p>Beko started his career in a public relations agency before starting his own business importing and distributing consumer goods and medicines — one of the biggest such firms in the Balkans.</p>
      <p>While Vucic was prime minister the government asked Beko to take over the ailing Serbian Railways, but he declined the offer.</p>
