      <p>THE FOOD SAFETY Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has issued a recall on a batch of popular hot chili sauce over concerns that its contents could explode.</p>
      <p>The authority has recalled 740ml bottles of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce with a best before date of March 2021 as it says there is a “risk of the contents exploding once the bottle is opened”.</p>

      <p>The FSAI said the sauce could irritate eyes or skin if this happens.</p>
      <p>Members of the public are advised to return affected bottles of the hot sauce to the location they were purchased from, or else to dispose of them.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the authority said that it could not confirm the reason for the possible cause of explosion, but said that such a risk sometimes occurred when gas in the product built up as a result of spoilage or uncontrolled fermentation.</p>
