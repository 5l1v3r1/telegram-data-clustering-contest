      <p>It was a somber Thanksgiving for UFC heavyweight Walt Harris — who posted an emotional “thank you” message to his stepdaughter Aniah Blanchard, a day after authorities <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/27/remains-confirmed-as-ufc-stars-missing-stepdaughter-aniah-blanchard/">confirmed her remains were found in Alabama</a>.</p>
      <p>“My sweet baby girl…I just wanna thank you for helping me change my life for the better,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5aXd65pjA_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Harris shared on Instagram Thursday</a>. “For teaching me how to be a man and a better father!”</p>
      <p>Blanchard, 19, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/27/ufc-fighters-stepdaughter-reported-missing-car-recovered/">was last seen Oct. 23</a> outside a gas station in Auburn. Her remains were found Monday in a rural area of Shorter, Alabama, as investigators searched for the teenager, authorities confirmed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The case is proceeding as a homicide investigation, according to the Auburn Police Department.</p>
      <p>“This pain is unbearable,” Harris wrote. “I know you want me to be strong, but it’s so hard baby, it’s so hard.”</p>
      <p>“Right now nothing makes sense and I’m so lost. I just want you back. I hope I made you proud,” he continued. “My lil mighty mighty tiger is an angel now. I love you baby girl forever and ever!”</p>
      <p>Two men, Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, and Antwain Shamar Fisher, 35, were arrested in Blanchard’s disappearance after her abandoned black Honda CRV was found in Montgomery with her own blood inside.</p>

      <p>Police received a tip that Yazeed was allegedly seen Oct. 23 at the Auburn convenience store, forcing Blanchard into her car and driving away.</p>
      <p>Both men were charged with first-degree kidnapping. Yazeed is being held in Lee County Jail without bond, and Fisher is being held on $50,000 bond.</p>
      <p>Additional charges may be forthcoming once a cause of death has been confirmed, Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A third man, David Lee Johnson Sr., 63, is charged with hindering prosecution.</p>
