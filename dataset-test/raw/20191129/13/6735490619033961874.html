      <p>As the holidays approach, Canadian R&amp;B singer Tamia is celebrating the season with the release of her festive new single “Someday At Christmas”.</p>
      <p>The latest from the six-time Grammy nominee is a cover of the holiday classic originally recorded by Stevie Wonder.</p>
      <p>The song clearly has a lot of meaning for the Ontario native, and in a recent interview with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-tamia-passion-like-fire-interview-20180903-story.html"><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a> she discussed why she thinks it’s important to have a special connection with a song in order to record it.</p>

      <p>“Well, I never record any song that I don’t love or like,” explained the 44-year-old singer-songwriter. “Some I fall in love with more than others, but I don’t go into the studio and just record songs all over the place. If I don’t like the song or if I don’t believe in it, I don’t record it. The toughest is going over the songs you love and seeing what speaks to you in the moment. If they don’t make a cohesive album, I hold on to them.”</p>
