        <b>A MAN who had a five-hour stand-off with armed police told officers he'd give himself up - if they brought him a KFC.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And while armed officers and a negotiator were standing just metres away outside the property, Graeme Hunter picked up the phone and rang the Evening Express.</p>

      <p>Police sealed off a section of in the Sheddocksley area of Aberdeen at about 1.30pm on July 1 after receiving reports of concern for a person's welfare.</p>
      <p>Emergency crews swooped on the cul-de-sac and specialist firearms officers and negotiators surrounded the property.</p>
      <p>Hunter, 29, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Thursday over the matter and was jailed for 14 months.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the drama, Hunter phoned a local newspaper and said: "The police have taken it too far. They've got guns and dogs for nothing at all.</p>
      <p>"I'm scared. My girlfriend is sitting next to me.</p>
      <p>"We're both sitting scared to go near any windows because they've got guns.</p>
      <p>"I've told them to go get something to eat. KFC.</p>
      <p>"I said, ‘If you get a KFC and put it through the window to my bird, I'll come out.’”</p>
      <p>Hunter, a prisoner of HMP Grampian, previously pleaded guilty to a charge of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by holding a knife to his neck and threatening to kill himself if police officers entered the property.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Laura Gracie said: “I'm certainly aware of the female being within the address.</p>
      <p>"She and Mr Hunter had made contact with a local newspaper whereby the two of them had given a version of events to the newspaper."</p>
      <p>"Mr Hunter has given an explanation that he consumed a heavy amount of alcohol.</p>
      <p>"He consumed alcohol the previous evening, through the night and into the early hours of the morning of the day of the offence."</p>
