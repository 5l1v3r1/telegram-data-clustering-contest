      <p>Bernice Blackstock called off her wedding to Liam Cavanagh last night and departed <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> for Australia.</p>
      <p>While<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-heartbroken-as-bernice-leaves-the-village-after-tragic-twist/"> fans were left heartbroken over her exit</a> as she went to care for her ex-husband, father of daughter Dee Dee, who'd had an accident, actress Samantha Giles has revealed it might not be the end after all...</p>
      <p>Speaking on Friday's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> (November 29) to hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Samantha said she would never rule out a return.</p>

      <p>"I've said so many times 'I wouldn't do this, I wouldn't do that' and you end up doing them, so never say never," she told Eamonn when he pointed out she could go back.</p>
      <p>"But for now, the door's closed."</p>
      <p>Samantha has played Bernice on and off for 21 years.</p>
      <p>Her most recent run of seven years was the longest, and she told the presenters why it was time for a change.</p>

      <p>"I just felt it was the right time, I'd been thinking about it for a couple of years and like a lot of actors I've got itchy feet.</p>
      <p>"I need a change, I want to play something a bit more gritty, I want to do some other stuff, there's so many things out there..."</p>
      <p>But her next project might not be acting - she told the hosts she's written two children's books.</p>
      <p>The stories are inspired by the other side of her life where the actress practices witchcraft.</p>

      <p>Samantha is a witch and uses wicker spells and charms and even told how she cast a spell to meet her ideal man - and then her husband came into her life.</p>
      <p>It was also revealed This Morning's Sharon Marshall credits Samantha with helping her to have her<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/daytime-tv/this-morning/this-mornings-sharon-marshall-welcomes-first-child/"> miracle baby, Betsey.</a></p>
      <p>"I gave her a change of luck charm which she used to help with the IVF," Sam admitted.</p>
