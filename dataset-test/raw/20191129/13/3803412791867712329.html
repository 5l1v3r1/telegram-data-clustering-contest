      <p>I do not mess around when it comes to coffee. Not at all.</p>
      <p>As such, I've experimented with a lot of different ways to make the perfect cup, and I've used a lot of different gear (including kettles, cones, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chemex+products&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoIPvBRDgARIsAHsCw0-oSQkruVrmc6cGeABZyanYkrPt2RS0QHY7WGh26rqieS4TRfFrVWEaAsmYEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=323433877435&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9001993&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=6351290116483880681&amp;hvtargid=aud-840076997981%3Akwd-301284688063&amp;hydadcr=28298_10731661&amp;ref=pd_sl_7rayop9g36_b&amp;tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU60544YYw">Chemexes</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=french+press&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU60544YYw">French Presses</a>, and a plethora of filters made of different materials), but the one tried-and-true go-to for me is the Hario Buono kettle. It's damn-near perfect. It's simple and does exactly what it's supposed to: heat up quickly, maintain that heat, and provide a steady consistent stream of water as your pour. It's durable, built to last and easy to clean. It looks right at home with modern stainless-steel appliances but doesn't stand out on any stovetop.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And it's on sale for the lowest price I've ever seen on Black Friday, just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hario-V60-Buono-Stainless-Gooseneck/dp/B008L3R8BM?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU60544YYw">$42.50 on Amazon with free Prime shipping</a>, down 30 percent from the list price of $67. That's a real steal. When I bought my first Hario Buono kettle in 2013, I shopped around for the best deal, and I still paid $50 for it and that was six years ago. (That kettle is still in great shape, too.)</p>

      <p>Functional, durable, and good looking, this pourover coffee kettle makes pouring the perfect cup of Joe at home easy. And it works like a charm on gas and electric stoves.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The version that's on sale for $42 is the smaller, one-liter kettle, but a larger 1.2-liter version is available for $5 more. I loved my first Hario Buono so much that I even invested in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HARIO-Kettle-Buono-copper-VKB-90CP/dp/B00GPHZZWA?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU60544YYw">the fancy copper version</a> and I love it, but that one is not nearly as affordable, and you won't likely find significant discounts.</p>
      <p>Whether you're new to the pourover game or an old pro, the Hario Buono absolutely will not disappoint, especially at this Black-Friday discounted price.</p>
