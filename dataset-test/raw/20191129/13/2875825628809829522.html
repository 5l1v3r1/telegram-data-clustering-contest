      <h1>Andy Murray tipped to win more Grand Slam titles with metal hip</h1>
      <h2>Andy Murray is expected to return to Grand Slam action in January at the Australian Open - 12 months after he was given an emotional send off Down Under</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:57:07+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Andy Murray can win more Grand Slams with his metal hip, according to his fitness trainer.</p>
      <p>“Anything is possible,” claimed Matt Little. “Andy just has this <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> that normal people just don't have so there is no limit to what he can do.”</p>
      <p>The story of Murray's return to tennis is documented in the Amazon Prime film Andy Murray: Resurfacing which is out on Friday.</p>
      <p>The next chapter in the Scot's story will be a return Down Under in January a year on from fearing his career was over.</p>
      <p>A second hip surgery has been followed by a comeback which saw Murray claim the European Open in Antwerp in his last ATP Tour event after a thrilling final against Stan Wawrinka.</p>
      <p>The three-time Grand Slam champion played only one match at the Davis Cup to rest a groin strain but will head out to Miami for a two-week training block with his team next week.</p>

      <p>“Can Andy win Grand Slams again, starting with the Australian Open? I think so,” said Little. “There is no reason why not really not if he is feeling good and he is in good shape going into the tournament.</p>
      <p>"That final against Stan was three hours after playing four or five other matches that week that were all tough. And in Slams you get a day off as well. And it is Andy. This is the thing. Andy just has this X Factor that normal people just don't have. So there is no limit to what he can do – there has never been a limit to what he can do.</p>
      <p>“The pain he can push himself through on the court is more than everyone else. If it all ends today, what he achieved in winning that tournament in Antwerp is ridiculous.</p>
      <p>"That was seven, eight months after surgery. You have seen the surgery now in the documentary – they basically cut his arse off and pulled his bone out through it.</p>

      <p>"To have that happen to you and then seven, eight months later to beat Stan Wawrinka, in the final of a decent level tournament, it is ridiculous to expect to do that and that is what he has done.</p>
      <p>“The other guys are trying hard against him. They don't want to probably lose to a guy with a metal hip either. But the result in Antwerp makes you optimistic for next year. Anything is possible.”</p>
      <p>This upbeat mood is in stark contrast to moments in the film where Murray decided to quit in Miami in December 2018 because he could not longer handle the pain.</p>
      <p>Little, who has worked as Murray's strength and conditioning coach since 2007, recalled: “We were in pieces, absolute bits.</p>

      <p>"Myself, Jamie (Delgado), and Shane (Annun), there were a lot of tears in that locker room. It was great for our wives to come along to the premiere and see what we have been through in the last few years</p>
      <p>Murray has yet to set a schedule for 2020 – and could follow Roger Federer's lead and skip the clay-court season to rest his body.</p>
      <p>“We will manage his schedule very carefully, very carefully, and very objectively,” Little added. “There has been no blueprint for this. No one has ever done this before. We have no idea what is around the corner.”</p>
