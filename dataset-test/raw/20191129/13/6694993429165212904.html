      <p>Pep Guardiola says that <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/mikel-arteta">Mikel Arteta</a> is travelling to Newcastle with the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> squad today as reports link him with the Arsenal job.</p>
      <p>The former Gunners midfielder is one of several names being mentioned in connection with the hot seat at the Emirates, after the London club announced the sacking of Unai Emery.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Guardiola</a> urged Arteta to stay with City, at least until summer, when asked earlier in the week, but he has refused to answer any questions about what Arteta's intentions might be.</p>
      <p>He simply replied: "He is in the squad, he travels to Newcastle," when quizzed about his assitant.</p>
      <p>Arteta was linked with Arsenal last year, before Emery was appointed, but said then that he wanted to win the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> with City.</p>
      <p>He also turned down the chance to take th Newcastle job a later old a Catalan radio station of his managerial job offers</p>
      <p>"The first time was different, the second was mostly me. Firstly, that I am not in a hurry and I have not felt that I need to take the step.</p>
      <p>"There are important conditions, especially in a first experience for me that are vital and eventually… I learned that these are essential to develop what you want, no matter how clear your vision is."</p>
      <p>Guardiola also expressed his sympathy for Emery, an old adversary from his time in charge at Sevilla in Spain.</p>
      <p>"I am so sorry for him. Every time a manager is sacked it’s not good news," he said.</p>
      <p>"He did incredible in Spain and France and made an incredible achievement which no-one else will do to win three (Europa Leagues) in a row with Sevilla.</p>
      <p>"That’s football. He knows and I know it’s about results. He will find a new job soon."</p>
