      <h1>Baby Yoda amigurimi, a crocheted cutie by Allison Hoffman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:00:21+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/blazenhoff_1" target="_blank">Rusty Blazenhoff</a></address>
      <p>Artist Allison Hoffman, aka <a href="https://www.craftyiscool.com/">Crafty is Cool</a>, is an absolute master of pop culture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amigurumi">amigurimi </a>("a portmanteau of the Japanese words ami, meaning 'crocheted or knitted,' and nuigurumi, meaning 'stuffed doll'"). She can crochet like nobody's business and each of her pieces are a work of art (<a href="https://boingboing.net/2012/07/13/breaking-bad-walt-jesse-ami.html">previously</a>). Now, she's taken to creating the real star of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, the new Star Wars series on Disney+, big-eyed Baby Yoda!</p>
      <p>But, she's only made one and you can't just buy it outright. If you want it, you'll have to bid on it on eBay. <a href="https://twitter.com/craftyiscool/status/1199907758738423808">Allison writes</a>, "I’ve gotten so many requests for the finished baby that this is really the only way I could fairly sell him! Thank you all! I have to make another for my husband so that he doesn’t buy this one..."</p>
      <p>As of this writing, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/174109764448">the bidding is already up to $305</a>. If that's too rich for your blood, well, hope you can crochet, because <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/743405956/pdf-the-child-amigurumi-baby-crochet?ref=listings_manager_grid">she's made its pattern available</a> ($7) in her Etsy shop.</p>
      <blockquote>We must protect the asset! Who even is he? Or she? Or what? Who cares? Its adorable. This pattern instructs you how to make a life-size stuffed baby inspired by Baby Yoda/Yiddle with easy to find supplies and simple techniques. Everything is photographed and explained in easy to follow step by step instructions. You should know basic crochet skills, but now is a good time to learn.<br/><br/>The Baby is 14" tall and weighs 2 lbs. He's got a little removable robe. Crochet him you must.</blockquote>
