      <p>A shop worker had strips torn off him – all for a good cause.</p>
      <p>Debenhams in East Kilbride raised nearly £200 for Kilbryde Hospice, based in the grounds of Hairmyres Hospital.</p>
      <p>And one worker, Iain Robertson, really pulled out all the stops – braving a waxing in front of his colleagues.</p>
      <p>There were also collections in store as well as raffles to help raise cash for the hospice.</p>

      <p>Jackie Gowran, technical services advisor at the flagship store, told the News:“It went really well and we had a great day.</p>
      <p>“Iain was a real sport doing the sponsored leg wax – and he didn’t even flinch, much to the disappoint of all the female staff!</p>
      <p>“Folk from Kilbryde came along as well as their mascot and they were delighted with the donation.</p>
