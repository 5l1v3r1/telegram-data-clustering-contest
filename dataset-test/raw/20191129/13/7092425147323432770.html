      <h1>Pochettino among five favourites for Arsenal job after Emery sacking</h1>

        <b>Following Unai Emery’s departure from Arsenal, former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is one of the early favourites.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino could make a shock move across north London and replace the <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/sport/unai-emery-sacked-by-arsenal-after-miserable-start-to-season-344692"><i>recently sacked Unai Emery</i></a> at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was recently dismissed himself by the Gunners’ fierce rivals Tottenham and promptly replaced by Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>However, the Argentine remains one of the best managers in the world and is among the five early favourites for the permanent job at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Along with Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, interim coach Freddie Ljungberg, Manchester City assistant Mikel Arteta and ex-Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri, Pochettino is one of the leading contenders, according to Paddy Power.</p>
      <p>Despite his link with Tottenham , the 47-year-old has certainly shown he can transform a club after taking Spurs from top four contenders to Champions League finalists over his five and a half year stint, and he could certainly do the same with Arsenal.</p>
      <p>However, while managing Spurs, Pochettino insisted he would never cross the north London divide to the Emirates.</p>
      <p>“I am never going to be manager of Barcelona or Arsenal because I am so identified with Tottenham and Espanyol.”</p>
      <p>However, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp reckons Pochettino would consider managing Arsenal, saying: “If I was a decision maker at Arsenal, I'd go for Mauricio Pochettino in a heartbeat.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure I believe Poch would let his time with Tottenham stop him from taking over.”</p>
      <p>Ex-Arsenal striker Paul Merson also backed Pochettino to replace Emery, saying: “Arsenal should go for Mauricio Pochettino. He’s not won anything, but he improved Tottenham over five years, tenfold.</p>
      <p>“He’s a top manager and he is about at the moment. I know he managed at Tottenham, but George Graham had been at Arsenal when he went the other way.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to get past that sort of stuff. These top managers don’t come along too often, where you don’t even have to pay anything for them.”</p>
