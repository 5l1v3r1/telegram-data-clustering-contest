      <p>Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebi">Sebi</a>) on Friday said that debt exchange traded funds (ETFS) and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/index-funds">index funds</a> must have a minimum of eight issuers, and no single issuer will have more than 15 per cent weight in the index.</p>
      <p>In a circular, the markets regulator said the debt ETFs/index funds will replicate the index completely, and if this is not feasible due to non-availability of issuances of the issuer forming part of the index, the debt ETFs/index funds will be allowed to invest in other issuances issued by the same issuer having deviation of +/- 10 per cent from the weighted average duration of issuances forming part of the index, subject to single issuer limit.</p>
      <p>However, at an aggregate portfolio level, the duration of debt ETF/index fund shall not deviate +/- 5 per cent from the duration of the index, the regulator said.</p>
      <p>In an event where the credit rating of an issuance falls below the investment grade or rating mandated in the index methodology, rebalancing by debt ETFs/index funds will be done within a period of 5 working days.</p>
      <p>The norms will not be applicable to debt ETFs/index funds tracking debt indices having constituents as <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/government-securities">government securities</a> (G-Secs), <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Treasury-Bills">Treasury Bills</a> and Tri-party Repo (TREPS) only.</p>
