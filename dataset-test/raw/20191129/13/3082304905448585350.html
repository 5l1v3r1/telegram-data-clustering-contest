        <b>Zinedine Zidane plans to keep Vinicius Junior at Real Madrid, even though he is struggling for regular first-team football.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vinicius Junior will not be leaving Real Madrid in the January transfer window, head coach Zinedine Zidane insists.</p>
      <p>The Brazil winger has not started a Madrid match since October 19 and has scored just once in 11 appearances in all competitions this season.</p>
      <p>The future of the 19-year-old has been placed in doubt, with some reports suggesting he could leave on loan at the turn of the year in order to find regular first-team football.</p>
      <p>Zidane, though, has no desire to let Vinicius leave and has backed him to prove his worth to Madrid.</p>
      <p>“Vinicius isn’t going to go. He’s going to continue here,” Zidane told reporters on Friday.</p>
      <p>“It’s not his moment right now, but it will be.</p>

      <p>“I have 26 players and I have to leave some out of the squad. It’s not his moment, as I’ve said, but he has to be ready for when it is.</p>
      <p>“What changed is that there’s [Eden] Hazard and there’s Rodrygo [Goes]. He’s training well but now there are other important players and I have to choose.”</p>
      <p>With Hazard having suffered an ankle injury in the Champions League draw with Paris Saint-Germain, Vinicius could get a chance to impress in Saturday’s LaLiga game against Deportivo Alaves.</p>
      <p>Zidane hopes to have Hazard available for next week’s meeting with Espanyol, although he remains uncertain over his return.</p>
      <p>“It’s nothing serious but there’s no concrete recovery plan. We’ll see if he can be ready for next week,” he said of the Belgium star.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say if he’ll be ready for the Clasico [on December 18]. Everything depends on how [the injury] evolves, on the day-to-day.”</p>
      <p>Zidane also offered sympathy to Unai Emery, who was sacked by Arsenal on Friday after a run of just one win in nine matches.</p>
      <p>“I’m very sorry. I don’t like it when coaches get sacked and Emery is a great coach,” he said of the former Sevilla boss.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure he’ll be coaching a team again very quickly.”</p>
