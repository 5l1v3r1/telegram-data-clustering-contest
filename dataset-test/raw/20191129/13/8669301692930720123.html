      <h1>Kho Kho: Defending champions India name 15-member teams for South Asian Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:58:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author">Scroll Staff</a></address>
      <p>Kho Kho Federation of India on Friday announced a 15-member men’s and women’s team for the 13th South Asian Games, scheduled to begin from December 1 in Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>
      <p>After inclusion of kho kho in the South Asian Games for the first time in 2016, both the Indian men’s and women’s team finished at the top of the podium.</p>
      <p>The defending champions will be aiming to repeat their gold medal-winning performances in Kathmandu. After some good performances in the recently-concluded test matches against Nepal, both the teams are heading to the competition with a boost in their confidence.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra’s Balasaheb Pokarde will lead the men’s team in the competition. “We have focused on getting a very balanced team for the Games. I think we are strong on both ends of the mat and have a good team combination. I am confident that we are going to give our best and win the (gold) medal again,” said Pokarde, who played a crucial role in the team’s gold winning performance.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, women’s team skipper Nasreen is wary of the challenges that the home team may pose. “We have practiced really hard for last one month. I believe we are a strong team heading into the competition. Since the competition is in Nepal, Nepal will surely pose some challenge but I believe we are prepared well to give our best and defend the title.”</p>
