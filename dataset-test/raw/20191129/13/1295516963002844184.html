      <p><i>Three Jokers</i> is a story that's over four years in the making, as the seeds were first planted in Johns and Fabok's <i>Justice League</i> #42 in June 2015. In that issue, Batman used the newly acquired powers of the Mobius Chair to ask two questions: Who really killed his parents, and what was The Joker’s real name? However, it wasn't until eight months later – the day <i>Justice League </i>#50 and <i>DC Universe: Rebirth </i>#1 hit stands -- that we finally got our answer as to what the Mobius Chair told Batman: "There are three."</p>
