      <p>This festive season consider taking a step back and thinking outside the proverbial gift box.</p>
      <p>What would make a real impact to your employees’ lives (aside from a bonus, of course!)?</p>
      <p>Here are a few ‘unconventional’ ideas for ways to gift something a little more special this year, from the world’s first on-demand accident cover to a float pod and penguin paddle-board experience.</p>
      <h3>The gift of zen</h3>

      <p>Burnout is a thing, especially as the holidays approach. Reward your team for their hard work with one of these ways to relax:</p>
      <p><b>• Float Zero:</b> There’s nothing like a float pod to reboot. It’s a womb-like wonder that has all sorts of benefits for the body and mind.</p>
      <p><b>• Kinesiology:</b> Another slightly less conventional gift, a kinesiology session is a lovely way to stimulate gentle healing by bringing all systems in the body into balance.</p>
      <p><b>• Get mindful:</b> What about a mindfulness or meditation course? Or maybe a yoga retreat somewhere pretty?</p>
      <p><b>• Feel the foot power:</b> A reflexology session could be just the ticket for your tired team.</p>
      <h3>The gift of protection</h3>

      <p>One of the best things you can do for your employees is make them feel protected and secure.</p>
      <p>Everyone knows South Africa’s roads are risky. And overseas travel also comes with concerns. What if a staff member gets injured in action?</p>
      <p>To provide peace of mind, consider investing in the world’s first on-demand accidental injury and death cover for your team.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sanlam.co.za/gocover/Pages/default.aspx">Sanlam Go Cover</a> is smart, simple and convenient. You can take out insurance for your staff for the holidays, or at any time, in five minutes flat.</p>
      <p><b>How it works</b>:</p>
      <p>Get up to R1 million (for yourself; up to R300,000 for someone else) in cover from just R12 a day to as little as R2.20. Cover includes insurance against over 30 different accidental injuries and death, wherever someone is in the world.</p>
      <p>There’s no paperwork and no long-term contract. Simply download the app, add people you want to cover, choose the period you want cover for and confirm the amount of cover required.</p>
      <p>It’s super simple and an incredible way to gift your team a happy, worry-free festive season with their families.</p>
      <h3>The gift of an experience</h3>
