      <p>The death of a baby boy in Co <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Armagh">Armagh</a> on Tuesday is being treated as murder, the police have said.</p>
      <p>Hunter McGleenon, who was 11 months old, died in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Keady">Keady</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Police+Service+of+Northern+Ireland">Police Service of Northern Ireland</a> (PSNI) initially said they were treating his death as suspicious, pending the results of a post mortem examination.</p>
      <p>Senior investigating officer, Det Chief Insp <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Eamonn+Corrigan">Eamonn Corrigan</a> said that “sadly, following the results of the post mortem, I can confirm I am now treating this as a murder investigation”.</p>
      <p>A 31-year-old man who was arrested on Tuesday remains in police custody.</p>
      <p>Det Chief <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Insp+Corrigan">Insp Corrigan</a> said his thoughts “remain with Hunter’s family and loved ones who are coming to terms with their devastating loss”.</p>
      <p>He said: “This is something no parent should ever have to experience. His family should be looking forward to Hunter’s second Christmas.”</p>
      <p>As part of the investigation, the police are seeking to trace the movements of a white BMW 5 Series, registration 11D14035, around the Keady area during the early hours of Tuesday November 26th.</p>
      <p>“Were you in the area and do you believe you saw this vehicle, or did you capture it on your dash cam?” asked Det Chief Insp Corrigan.</p>
      <p>“I would appeal to anyone who has any information to contact detectives on 101 quoting reference 587 of the 26/11/19. Alternatively information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”</p>
