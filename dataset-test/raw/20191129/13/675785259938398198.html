      <h1>Arsenal stars open up on working with Freddie Ljungberg and his coaching style</h1>
      <h2>Ljungberg returned to Arsenal's youth set up in 2018, and after being promoted to assistant manager in the summer now finds himself as interim boss after Unai Emery's departure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:03:40+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fredrik-ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> has been announced as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal's</a> interim manager following the dismissal of Unai Emery on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>It caps quite the rise for the Swede in the last 18 months, since returning to the Emirates after an ill-fated stint as assistant manager at Wolfsburg.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg, who played 326 times for the Gunners during nine years as a player, returned to lead the Under-23 side, before being promoted to assistant manager with the first team in the summer.</p>
      <p>Since then, a number of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> ’s youngsters have spoken about working with the 43 year-old, discussing how he works and what they have learned from him.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at what has been said about the man who will take charge for the first time at Norwich this weekend from some of the stars who know him best...</p>
      <h3>Joe Willock</h3>

      <p>"Freddie is not only such a legend at the club, he’s an unbelievable manager and coach,” proclaimed Joe Willock back in August "He's a mentor for me, he showed me a lot behind the scenes that people don’t really know about.”</p>
      <p>Wilock, who has made an impact at senior level this term, and played the full 90 minutes of Emery’s final game, also revealed how Ljungberg has been working with him on specific midfield roles.</p>
      <p>"Every day I'm working with him and I'm learning from him. He has improved me a lot and I'm just trying to get better every day.</p>
      <p>"To be honest, he's improved my whole overall game. If I'm being specific, getting in the pockets when I'm playing No.10 and attacking at No.8.</p>
      <p>"He showed me a lot of different tactics to get space and turn to attack other teams. Those are the main things really."</p>
      <h3>Reiss Nelson</h3>

      <p>Reiss Nelson, who impressed on loan at Hoffenheim last term but has had an injury hit return to Arsenal this year, spoke to <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/nelson-how-weve-found-it-under-ljungberg-so-far">Arsenal.com</a> about how demanding Ljungberg could be in training.</p>
      <p>"They’re very high and he’s a great coach as well and I think he’s got very high standards for the young group that we have.</p>
      <p>"I think we can go on to carry our trophy again this season if we play well and train hard.”</p>
      <h3>Bukayo Saka</h3>

      <p>"Freddie is very supportive of me," Saka told <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/players/freddie-ljungberg-cristiano-ronaldo-father-16951058">Football.London in September,</a> when he too revealed Ljungberg’s work with him about the tactical and mental side of the game.</p>
      <p>“He was teaching me some tactics but I can’t quite remember what he was saying He does give me a lot of information but it was always helpful.</p>
      <p>"It helps so much. Sometimes when I don't understand, when the coach is trying to communicate with me, I have a better communication with Freddie sometimes, he speaks better English.</p>
      <p>"Freddie's information, he’s been a player at this level before, and it’s vital for me because I play in the same position as me and he's been a big part in my progress.</p>
      <p>"He gives a lot of advice to me every day but one of the most, the best piece of advice he's given me is to stay humble. He's been with me since I was 15, seen me do amazing things but he always tells me to stay humble, keep working hard because he really thinks I can be a top player.</p>
      <p>"I feel like he's been a player before so he understands how I would feel, he's played in my position and it''s just so good to have him there, an Arsenal legend giving me advice. Not much more I can ask for more."</p>
      <h3>Emile Smith Rowe</h3>
      <p>Emile Smith Rowe, the young playmaker, spoke about Ljungberg’s influence in July, as the Swede stepped up into a more senior role with the first team.</p>
      <p>Smith Rowe had previously worked with him with the Under-23s and said: "It's a bit surreal working with a legend like Freddie.</p>
      <p>"You can take on a lot from him and I'm excited to work with him again. All the young players are because we had him with the Under-23s. We're privileged to work with him.</p>
      <p>"He's given the lads a lot of information on working with Unai, he's trying to help the young boys make the step up.</p>
      <p>"He's been there, he knows what it likes, so it's great to work with him."</p>
