      <p>The Portuguese has overseen two wins from two so far, claiming <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/west-ham-united-vs-spurs_game_92634.html">a 3-2 win over West Ham United</a> and coming back from behind to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/spurs-vs-olympiacos_game_96729.html">beat Olympiacos 4-2 last time out</a> in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The visit of the Cherries will be Mourinho's first home game in the Premier League and he will be looking for a similar result, although he will be keen to shore his side up defensively.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how Spurs could line up for Saturday's showdown.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mourinho is unlikely to make too many - if any - changes to a winning formula after two wins on the bounce with largely the same set of players.</p>
      <p>WIth Lloris and Vorm out, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paulo-gazzaniga/"><b>Paulo Gazzaniga</b></a> is assured of his place in goal, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/serge-aurier/"><b>Serge Aurier</b></a> is the only natural, senior right-back at the club and will expect to retain his spot in any case following his goal against Olympiacos.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese has favoured a centre-back pairing of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toby-alderweireld/"><b>Toby Alderweireld</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/davinson-sanchez/"><b>Davinson Sanchez</b></a> thus far, meaning <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jan-vertonghen/"><b>Jan Vertonghen</b></a> could be left on the bench once more. Meanwhile, at left-back, Davies' injury leaves <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-rose/"><b>Danny Rose</b></a> as the sole option in his position.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has started both his two games with a double-pivot of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-winks/"><b>Harry Winks</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eric-dier/"><b>Eric Dier</b></a>. However, the latter was hooked in the first half as Spurs went 2-0 down in favour of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-eriksen/"><b>Christian Eriksen</b></a> to provide greater attacking impetus.</p>
      <p>Given the resurgence of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dele-alli/"><b>Dele Alli</b></a> ahead of the pair, it seems unlikely that the Dane could displace him, while a midfield combination including both Alli and Eriksen is imbalanced, and far more gung-ho than Mourinho is known for. With that in mind, the Dane may be forced to remain on the bench once again.</p>
      <p>Either side of Alli is likely to be <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-moura/"><b>Lucas Moura</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/son-heung-min/"><b>Son Heung-min</b></a> as natural wide players, comprising the trio that will support <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-kane/"><b>Harry Kane</b></a> up front.</p>
