      <p>Santa is getting ready to run around Willand to raise funds for Cayla’s Fight.</p>
      <p>The Willand Rovers FC Santa Run is taking place on Saturday, December 8, from the clubhouse at 10:30 am.</p>
      <p>Money raised will go towards helping Cayla Jones, 5, and her fight against neuroblastoma.</p>
      <p>The route follows a course of 5km around Willand. There is a junior route of 1km. Each runner must wear Santa suits or festive hats. Juniors are allowed to take part on the senior course.</p>

      <p>Another event supporting Cayla’s Fight takes place on Saturday, December 14, when a pop-up play café will take place at Cullompton Community Centre.</p>
      <p>The event will welcome Santa, a face painter, and the chance to paint your pottery.</p>
