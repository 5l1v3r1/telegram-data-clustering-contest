      <p>Ayda Field has revealed she had concerns about her husband <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/robbie-williams/">Robbie Williams</a> when they met.</p>
      <p>The duo were first introduced to each other just two weeks before the star entered rehab.</p>
      <p>And now the pair have discussed their first impressions when talking on Loose Women.</p>
      <p>The father-of-three said: ‘I met Ayda two weeks before going to rehab and it still didn’t put her off! You are mental, you really rolled the dice there babes.’</p>
      <p>However, the actress insisted she followed her heart, and ignored the warning signs.</p>

      <p>‘I didn’t know what I was getting into,’ she confessed: ‘There were warning signs dancing over his head, but I was like, “I think I love him.”’</p>

      <p>As the crowd cooed, the star continued: ‘If you love someone you go with your heart and I went with all the crazy mess that went with him.’</p>
      <p>Robbie was on the show to promote his new Christmas album and said he can finally enjoy the festive season after overcoming his demons.</p>
      <p>‘I had to stop boozing and then Christmas became a symbol of what’s wrong with your life,’ he explained.</p>

      <p>‘Everything is on TV going, “hey you should be loving and family is great’ and it made me feel worse. But then came Ayda.’</p>
      <p>Beaming down the lens, he said: ‘She’s like a professional memory maker, she makes anniversaries incredible and we get lost in festive joy because of this lady.</p>
      <p>‘Christmas was phenomenal before the kids, but then the kids made it sensational.’</p>
      <p>When the show started the singer forgot he was live on air and ended up walking into the ITV studio to see his wife.</p>

      <p>Looking confused, the guest panelist quizzed him over what he was doing to which Robbie laughed: ‘What we’re not live are we?’</p>
      <p>When the hosts nodded, the Angels hitmaker quickly ran away as Ayda shouted: ‘Oh bless him, bless him!’</p>
      <p>But his faux pas was soon explained, as he arrived back on stage for his slot.</p>
      <p>Taking a seat, the 45-year-old said: ‘I thought you were speaking to Phil and Holly and then people looked worried and I was like, “You can’t stop me from speaking to my wife!”’</p>

      <p>Looking at the audience, he shrugged: ‘Soz everybody.’</p>
