      <p>The Seagulls face the daunting task of taking on a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> side unbeaten in their last 30 games in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a>'s men are eight points clear at the top of the table, although were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Potter's young side have already upset Tottenham and Everton this season and he hopes they will rise to the occasion on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We'll have to embrace the challenge and everything it brings," he told reporters at a press conference on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Teams like Barcelona will go there and they'll tell you that it's a big atmosphere.</p>
      <p>"The supporters get properly behind the team – there's a real history and tradition to it which makes it a special place. The environment can be really powerful, but that's one of the big challenges for us to rise to.</p>
      <p>"It's all part of what we have to do to get a result. You have to deal with everything that surrounds the game as well as what happens out on the field."</p>
      <p>Brighton head to Merseyside on the back of two-goal defeats to Leicester and Manchester United, but before those losses, the Seagulls had won three of their previous four games in the division.</p>
      <p>Potter accepts they will need an element of luck to get the better of Champions League holders Liverpool and also appreciates they will have to improve compared to recent weeks.</p>
      <p>A boost for the 44-year-old will be the return of captain Lewis Dunk after suspension and the fact young forward Aaron Connolly is back in training after a groin injury.</p>
      <p>"We have to play well and hope they have an off day – but we can influence that and we certainly have to be better than we have been in the last couple of weeks," Potter added.</p>
      <p>"I have no idea who'll win the league and it's hard to say in November who'll do what, but clearly they've been fantastic up until this point of the season.</p>
      <p>"Their points record over the last few years has been amazing – to maintain that and fight for the Champions League is incredible from them. I think whoever wants to win the league will have to get themselves above Liverpool."</p>
