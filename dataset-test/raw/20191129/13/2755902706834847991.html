      <p>Vapostori ie Members of the apostolic sect church are a common sight in Zimbabwe with many secluded places serving as shrines or Masowe as they are commonly known. However, with many Zimbabweans leaving the country for greener pastures in Europe, they are taking their Apostolic religion with them much to the surprise of Europeans who have no idea of what will be going on.</p>
