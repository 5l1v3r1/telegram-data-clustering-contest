      <p>“Sa ilalim po ng batas, may pananagutan po ang mga customer na tumatangkilik sa prostitution kaya nananawagan po tayo sa ating mga kababayan na huwag tangkilikin ang mga ganitong illegal establishment bagkus ay i-report sa amin para sa kaukulang aksyon,” Quezon City Police District (QCPD) director Brigadier General Ronnie Montejo said.</p>
      <p>(Under the law, customers patronizing prostitution will be held liable, so we urge our citizens not to enjoy such illegal establishments but report it to us for appropriate action.)</p>
      <p>This was Montejo’s warning after authorities from the QCPD and the City’s local government raided another massage spa which was being used as a front for prostitution.</p>
      <p>According to Montejo, his team received information that LS Aroma Spa at No. 285 City Plaza Homes 2, Tandang Sora Avenue in Brgy. Pasong Tamo was being used as a prostitution den where customers were offered ‘extra service’ or sexual activities in exchange for payment.</p>
      <p>Combined personnel of QCPD’s Special Operations Unit, Women’s and Children Protection Desk, and the QC Social Services Development Department (SSDD) led the operation which resulted in the arrest of the manager and cashier of the spa identitied as Rufilyn Tabac, 34.</p>
      <p>Six female therapists were also rescued during the raid and were turned over to the QC-SSDD for proper intervention.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the spa owner, identified as Wiljay Puno, managed to escape and is now the subject of a manhunt.</p>
      <p>A raft of charges are being prepared against Puno and the arrested manager for violating Republic Act 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, and C.O SP 91, S-93 or the Quezon City Revenue Code.</p>
      <p>Last month, local authorities in Quezon City shut down Dragon Spa along E. Rodriguez Sr. Avenue in Brgy. Mariana after police confirmed illegal activities there.</p>
      <p>A customer and the cashier of the spa were nabbed during the raid while four women disguised as therapists were rescued.</p>
      <p>This prompted Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte to order a crackdown on spas and massage parlors prostituting women.</p>
