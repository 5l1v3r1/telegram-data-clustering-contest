      <h2>Former Wolves managing director Laurie Dalrymple has dropped plans to take the club to a tribunal over his departure.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:37:19+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/richard-guttridge/" target="_blank">Richard Guttridge</a></address>
      <p>The 44-year-old had made legal claims at Birmingham Employment Tribunal against Wolves for unfair dismissal and for a "whistle blowing" allegation - known legally as a public interest disclosure.</p>
      <p>It's understood the club was preparing to defend the claims.</p>
      <p>Now tribunal Judge Harding has announced that Mr Dalrymple has withdrawn the case.</p>
      <p>Documents associated with the case said "the proceedings are dismissed following a withdrawal of the claim by the claimant".</p>
      <p>No details have been revealed why they were withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Mr Dalrymple spent more than four years with the club - first in commercial affairs and then as managing director. He was a key figure in the Wolves hierarchy under Chinese owners Fosun as Wolves were promoted to the Premier League before qualifying for Europe last season.</p>
      <p>He left the club in July amid reports of a breakdown in his relationship with chairman Jeff Shi and the Molineux board..</p>
      <p>He has since turned his attentions to rugby and become chief executive of Premiership club Harlequins.</p>
