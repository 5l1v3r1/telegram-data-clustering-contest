      <p>Young British prog rock outfit KOYO release their new single, <i>Ostracise</i>d, today through 88 Watt Records. You can listen to the single below.</p>
      <p>“We liked the idea of writing a song that manages to pull together both directions we’ve been going in, the wilder, more raucous side and the spacey, poppier side," singer Huw Edwards tells <i>Prog</i>. "It ended up being both one of the heaviest and catchiest songs we’ve ever written and kinda feels like our most “KOYO” song yet in that respect. </p>
      <p>"Lyrically, let it be an anthem for anyone who’s felt disconnected or cut off from something, someone, maybe society or socially. I think a lot of the time that anxiety can simply exist within someone’s own head, but then spreads like a virus. I think people often kind of “ostracise” themselves, just from thinking they are, and it becomes like a vicious circle. For me, the best way of dealing with that is simply communication, and not dwelling on those insecurities but pushing forward.” </p>
      <p>The band, who released their acclaimed self-titled debut in 2017, will release their second album next year.</p>
      <p>"We’re influenced by a lot of the modern psych stuff that’s going on, bands like Tame Impala and UMO, and I had this sound in my head that was basically a darker, heavier take on that, but still with all the warmth from the synths and production - almost like a Deftones meets Tame Impala thing," adds Edwards. "I think <i>Ostracised</i> was the brain child of that idea, but it was Tom’s wild, Bonham-esque drum groove that kicked it off."</p>
