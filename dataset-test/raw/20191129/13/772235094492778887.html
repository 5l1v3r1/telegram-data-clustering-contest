      <p>Reservations have opened for the new <b>Fisker Ocean</b> electric SUV.</p>
      <p>Touted as “the world’s most sustainable vehicle”, the Ocean will set lessees back US$379 per month (<b>A$560</b>) regardless of where they live.</p>
      <p>You can reserve an Ocean now through the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/fisker/">Fisker</a> app for a refundable US$250 (<b>A$369</b>) reservation fee. Customers will then pay US$2,999 (<b>A$4,431</b>) before delivery.</p>

      <p>Fisker is touting the flexibility of its lease package. Lessees will choose how long they keep their Ocean, whether it’s one month or several years. There’ll be no long-term contracts and lessees can drive more than <b>48,000km</b> per year.</p>
      <p>If your Ocean requires servicing or repairs, a Fisker staff member will come and pick up your vehicle.</p>
      <p>The Fisker app will also allow customers to obtain quotes for insurance, Fisker claiming insurance costs “are projected to be significantly lower than other vehicles on the road today due to a unique and proprietary low cost of service and maintenance model.”</p>
      <p>"Our mission is to become the No.1 e-mobility service provider on Earth, featuring the world's most desirable and sustainable vehicles while shaking up the old automotive industry model", said Fisker chairman and CEO Henrik Fisker.</p>

      <p>There is the option to buy an Ocean outright but Fisker says this will be available only for a very limited number of vehicles.</p>
      <p>The Ocean will be available with one of five different option packages, though information won’t be available on these until next year.</p>
      <p>The open-roof California Mode feature will be standard on all Oceans bar the base model. Fisker says it allows “passengers to experience the sun, fresh air and an open feeling without being in a convertible”.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the roof, it’ll also capture energy from the sun.</p>

      <p>The standard drivetrain will include an 80kWh battery pack, which is estimated to achieve an electric range of between 400 and 480 kilometres per US EPA standards. The Ocean will be available with electric motors at both the front and rear of the vehicle, providing the SUV with four-wheel-drive.</p>
      <p>To support its claim of being the most sustainable vehicle in the world, the Ocean will make extensive use of recycled materials. That includes the carpets (old fishing nets) and upholstery (polyester clothing fibers, recycled bottles).</p>
      <p>A “complete production-intent prototype” of the Ocean will debut in January 2020 with production slated to begin in late 2021.</p>
      <p>Deliveries will commence in 2022, though experience centres will open next year allowing prospective customers to check out the Ocean in person. Customers will also be able to schedule test drives via the app in 2021.</p>
