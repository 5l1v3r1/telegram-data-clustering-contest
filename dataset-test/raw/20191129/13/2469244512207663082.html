      <p>A nanny has admitted taking an indecent picture of a child and sending it to a man over the internet.</p>
      <p>Venezuelan-born Maria Alfonzo pleaded guilty to taking and distributing an indecent image of a child at Paignton on June 12 this year and sent it electronically to a man in the Newcastle area.</p>
      <p>Alfonzo, aged 31, of Southey Lane, Newton Abbot, was remanded in custody by Judge Peter Johnson at Exeter Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Alfonzo appeared by video link from Eastwood Park prison near Bristol and her case was transferred to Newcastle Crown Court for sentence.</p>

      <p>The judge told her:"I am transferring the case to Newcastle Crown Court, for obvious reasons.</p>
