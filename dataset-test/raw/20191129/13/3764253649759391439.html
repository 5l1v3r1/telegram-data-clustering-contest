      <p><i>“I think he’s the best in the Premier League at tackling and winning the ball back, bar none,” </i>Maddison told Football Daily.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I know (N’Golo) Kante is a brilliant player and there are players like that. But actually winning the ball back and taking the ball off the opposition, I don’t think there is anyone better than Wilfred.</i>

        <i>“Sometimes you get a player like that and what he does doesn’t get on the back page of the papers, doesn’t get talked about on Match of the Day.</i>
      </p>

        <i>“He’s fantastic at what he does and he lets players like me and Youri Tielemans do our thing ."</i>
