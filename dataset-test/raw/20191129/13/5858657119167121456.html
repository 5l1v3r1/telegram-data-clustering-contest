      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — Three protesters taking part in a mock funeral procession through downtown Vancouver have been arrested.</p>
      <p>The “Funeral For Extinction” protest was organized by Extinction Rebellion.</p>
      <p>Police are not releasing any more information about the arrests, but the intersection of Robson and Burrard has been blocked off.</p>
      <p>The arrests happened after several tripod-like structures were erected, blocking traffic.</p>
      <p>Police and the fire department were called to the scene.</p>
      <p>Flora, who wouldn’t provide her last name, arrived just after the arrests.</p>
      <p>“A few rebels installed themselves on top of tripods at Robson and Burrard. I was sort of an occupation of that intersection. I just saw the end of it when they got taken down. They went peacefully and it was just sort of part of the disruption.”</p>
      <p>After the arrests, the group moved on to Robson and Thurlow.</p>

      <p>She says the protesters understand that their demonstrations can be frustrating for people driving and shopping downtown. But Friday’s action is meant to challenge business as usual.</p>
      <p>“Robson is a popular shopping spot. So, we’ll maybe get people to think a little bit about whether they really need all that stuff in their bags or whether they could be doing something better with their time, like joining us in the street.”</p>
      <p>Since the event started at 1 p.m., traffic has been disrupted by people walking through the city’s commercial and financial districts near Robson and Burrard.</p>
      <p>The group chose to host the event on Black Friday because of what they describe as the “over-consumption of unnecessary goods.”</p>
      <p>“We will mourn for the future of our planet, our ecosystems, and the lives lost due to climate crisis,” organizers said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/500092527248319/">in a Facebook post</a>.</p>
      <p>Before the protest, a spokesperson said the demonstration will “provide an alternative to the culture of corporate consumerism that has contributed to climate change.”</p>
      <p>Ten protesters from Extinction Rebellion were arrested after they blocked the Burrard Street Bridge in October.</p>
