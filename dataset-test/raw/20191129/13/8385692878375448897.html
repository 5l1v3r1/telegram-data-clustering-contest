      <p>Android 10 firmwares for the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a> Galaxy S10 series are now <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s10_series_stable_android_10_is_now_available_for_download_-news-40321.php">available to download</a>. Do note that this is a stable build of Android 10, and it's the very first stable Android 10 build from the company.</p>
      <p>Android 10 Beta has been available for the Galaxy S10, S10e, and S10+ for quite some time now. This stable update was expected to arrive soon, and it's now here, kind of. It's still not widely rolling out, only some users in Germany have received it, it seems. According to the latest information, this update will start widely rolling out to the Galaxy S10 in January.</p>
      <h3>Android 10 update for the Galaxy S10 series brings One UI 2.0 To The Table</h3>
      <p>This update brings Samsung's One UI 2.0 skin on the Galaxy S10 series, along with some stock Android features. The update weighs over 1.9GB, and it brings the December security patch with it.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>If you don't want to wait for the update to reach you, though, you can download this update via the links provided down below. SamMobile was nice enough to upload firmwares for all three devices, so you can flash them manually. Do not go ahead with the process if you don't know exactly what you're doing. If you don't do the job properly, you may end up bricking your phone.</p>
      <p>Make sure to select the right country (and carrier if needed) before you download any of these firmwares, though. When you hit the link for your device, you'll see a drop-down menu with 'Country' options.</p>
      <p>Samsung had further polished the design of its skin with One UI 2.0. The company also made some improvements to the dark mode in this build.</p>

      <p>One UI 2.0 also adds Google navigation gestures, that the company added with Android 10. You can opt to use those, or Samsung's very own gestures. Do note that on-screen buttons are still available, of course.</p>
      <h3>The camera UI got redesigned</h3>
      <p>The camera UI got redesigned in One UI 2.0, yet again. You can no longer see all the camera modes in the new camera application. You'll see the main ones, but all others are grouped in the 'More' section.</p>
      <p>Screen recorder comes built-in with One UI 2.0, while you also get a new shortcut and gesture for enabling One-handed mode.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The company has also added quite a few new animations with One UI 2.0. Those are pretty much all the major changes, Samsung did not change a whole lot.</p>
      <p>Once again, this update is available for the Galaxy S10, S10e, and S10+ as we speak. If you'd like to download it for a specific phone, hit one of the links down below. You can also wait for the update to reach your device, though that may take a while.</p>
