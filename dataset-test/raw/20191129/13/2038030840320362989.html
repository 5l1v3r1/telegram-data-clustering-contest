      <p>Cape Town - <i>Expresso </i>presenter Leigh-Anne Williams has taken a step back from hosting duties, to pursue other career opportunities - but it doesn't mean she has left the show for good.</p>
      <p>Following reports that Leigh-Anne has exited the show, after her noticeable absence on-air, executive producer, Patience Stevens has released an official statement.  </p>
      <p>"Leigh-Anne has been a very important part of the <i>Expresso </i>journey for the past eight years and is a valued member of the Cardova family. While Leigh-Anne has been taking a step back from her daily presenting role on <i>Expresso </i>to pursue other career opportunities, this does not mean the end of our relationship with her. Leigh Anne will be back on <i>Expresso </i>in December, and we are keen to pursue new and existing shows and roles with her in 2020," she said. </p>
      <p>She explained: "While we have missed Leigh-Anne's positive energy every morning for the past couple of weeks, Cardova's mission statement is to identify, nurture and grow new talent. We have recently welcomed two fresh new faces to <i>Expresso</i>, namely the winners of the <i>Presenter Search on </i><i>3: Expresso Edition</i>, <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/meet-expressos-two-new-presenters-20191031"><b>Kuhle Adams and Jamie Lee Domburg</b></a>, who have been adding their own unique dynamic and personality to the show."</p>
      <p><i>Expresso</i>, which made its debut in October 2010 aired from The Equinox Building in Cape Town before moving to a new studio in Westlake in June.</p>
