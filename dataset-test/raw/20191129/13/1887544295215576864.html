      <p>Detectives will return to a west-end neighbourhood today as they canvass for information about a deadly-hit-and-run that claimed the life of a 77-year-old woman out for a morning walk on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The victim, identified as Pasquina Lapadula by friends and family, was crossing Islington Avenue midblock near Aviemore Drive when she was struck at around 6:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>The suspect vehicle did not stop and was last seen headed northbound on Islington Avenue.</p>
      <p>It is described as a dark-coloured SUV with possible front end damage, specifically to a head lamp.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night, police did release a brief surveillance video of a vehicle of interest in the case, however both the suspect and the suspect vehicle remain outstanding.</p>
      <p>In a message posted to Twitter on Friday morning, police said that detectives would return to the intersection today to canvass for more information related to the case.</p>
