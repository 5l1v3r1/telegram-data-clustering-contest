      <h1>This story has legs: Cambodia ‘bug cafe’ serves up insect tapas</h1>

      <p>Ant spring rolls, silkworm taro croquettes and a “bug mac” — Cambodia’s first insect tapas restaurant is mixing cocktail culture with creepy crawler fare.</p>
      <p>At the busy “Bugs Cafe” in the tourist town of Siem Reap, chef Seiha Soeun stands over a sizzling wok in the kitchen tossing in crickets, grasshoppers, tarantulas, and scorpions.</p>

      <p>Sold at street vendors or in Instagram-friendly tourist spots, insects aren’t new to Cambodian palates.</p>
      <p>But they are usually served one way: fried, with dipping sauce, and maybe a cold beer.</p>
      <p>“We have a different kind of menu,” Seiha said, adding that he practiced making the “bug mac” — a patty of pureed ant, bee, silkworm and cricket topped with a slice of cheese and pickle — many times to get it just right.</p>
      <p>On a recent evening at the restaurant, French co-founder Davy Blouzard greeted curious diners and explained the menu.</p>
      <p>“We want to show that it’s possible to make quality food with insects,” he said.</p>
      <p>There is sweet potato cream with bee larvae, silkworm and mango flambe, and even a cricket cheesecake dessert.</p>
      <p>Insects are eaten by two billion people worldwide, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization.</p>
      <p>Besides being a cheap source of protein, insect cuisine is also a possible answer to rising concern over the environmental impact of livestock farming.</p>
      <p>As dinner orders picked up, tourists from as far afield as Britain, Poland and Malaysia all happily — if a little squeamishly — crunched away.</p>
      <p>Servers worked the room wearing shirts emblazoned with the words “I HATE INSECTS”, with the “H” crossed out.</p>
      <p>British backpacker Joshua Bean, 23, said he knew he had to visit the cafe after seeing an ad for the unusual eatery at his hostel.</p>
      <p>He didn’t flinch at the “juicy” silkworms and an assortment of other insects piled up on his plate.</p>
      <p>“It’s not the kind of thing you get back home,” he said.</p>
