      <p>As we just talked about again in today’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/red-death-cattle-decapitation-griselda-smoke-dza-currensy-paul-wall-statik-selektah-reviews/">Notable Releases</a>, one of this year’s most exciting metal tours is <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/cattle-decapitation-prep-death-atlas-touring-with-atheist-full-of-hell-more/">Cattle Decapitation, Atheist, Full of Hell, Author &amp; Punisher, and Vitriol</a>. It recently got underway, but has suddenly hit a major snag. East coast grindcore greats <b>Full of Hell</b> posted the following message:</p>
      <blockquote>Last night our entire van was stolen with all of our gear, merch and even most of our clothing. We’ve been touring for 10 years and have been lucky enough to have never been robbed before. There have been close calls but never anything like this. I feel completely crushed to lose all of the gear we spent years building and tinkering with along with our trustworthy van. I also feel completely ashamed to ask for anything from you guys but a friend has made us a gofundme to possibly help us rebuild. Anyone that knows us know that we’ve been gunning at 100% since we started but right now we are feeling very defeated. <b>We are going to be dropping the rest of the dates with Cattle Decapitation</b>, which might be the most crushing thing of all, because we never cancel tours. I’m just at a loss for words right now. We are feeling very low. Check this out if you want to. Thank you.<br/><br/>– Dylan<br/><br/><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/full-of-hell-stolen-van-and-gear">https://www.gofundme.com/f/full-of-hell-stolen-van-and-gear</a></blockquote>
      <p>That sucks! Black Friday, indeed. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/full-of-hell-stolen-van-and-gear">Help</a> if you can. UPDATE: They reached their goal and then some very quickly, so shut down the GoFundMe, and said they’ll donate anything extra to charity.</p>
