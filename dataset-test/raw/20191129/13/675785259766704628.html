      <p>Marco Silva has been given a vote of confidence from Everton's board.</p>
      <p>Blues Director of Football Marcel Brands said: "As a Board, we have got to support that. Of course, we know in sport, as always, you have to perform - that’s me, the manager, the players, for everyone.</p>
      <p>"It’s also important, especially in this Club, after a couple of years of instability, to stick together in this situation.</p>
      <p>"I think it is important that everyone has the feeling that we can turn this around to better results.</p>
      <p>"Most people know that I always go to the dressing room after the game, to see how the atmosphere is.</p>

      <p>"Of course, everyone was disappointed last Saturday but you saw also really in the eyes of the players the fire that they want to resolve this, to turn this around – together with the whole staff.</p>
      <p>"That's important coming up towards the next couple of games. They will be tough games but games where we can improve."</p>
