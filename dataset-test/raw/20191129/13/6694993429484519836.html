      <h1>Controversial new Littleborough housing estate given go-ahead despite flooding fears</h1>
      <h2>Rochdale Council's planning committee approved the 96 home scheme</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:30:03+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Statham, https://www.facebook.com/nickstathamreporter/</a></address>
      <p>‘Improved’ plans for a controversial new housing estate in Littleborough have been given the go-ahead - but residents still fear it could put them at greater risk of flooding.</p>
      <p>Russell Homes already has planning permission to build  110 new homes off New Street - but has now been granted approval for a  scaled down scheme on the same site.</p>
      <p>Residents of surrounding streets have long fought against development of the 16 acre site - citing concerns over flooding, traffic and privacy - as well as damage to local flora and fauna.</p>
      <p>But Russell Homes director Daniel Kershaw told a meeting of Rochdale council’s planning committee that the new 96-home development presented an opportunity for a better scheme.</p>
      <p>He said: “We have submitted this planning application because we want to improve on the current scheme we are developing.</p>
      <p>“There is an opportunity to improve on the scheme and enhance this development. We are not benefiting in the short-term from this development in terms of the changes proposed."</p>
      <p>He continued: “There’s no gain, there’s more cost, from the scheme proposed this evening, but we hope the improvement will be recognised by future home owners and it’s this consideration that has informed this application.”</p>
      <p>The new scheme involves a ‘cut and fill operation’ that would raise the ground level of a one-acre hollow at the centre of the site, in order to make it less prone to flooding.</p>
      <p>Water would drain to a drainage area and attenuation ponds to the south of the site ‘to ensure that flood risk is not increased downstream’.</p>
      <p>Mr Kershaw told councillors this would result in 10, rather than 20, homes facing on to a flood area - and these would be ‘clearly separated by embankments and infrastructure’.</p>

      <p>He added: “The design of the scheme is better - better in flooding terms and better in design terms, and this is the opportunity to take advantage of a better scheme.”</p>
      <p>New Street resident Richard Marson told the committee flooding was his ‘major concern’, while other residents had already been affected by traffic, noise and vibration from work at the site.</p>
      <p>The removal of trees was also said to have created a ‘significant privacy issue’ - although Mr Kershaw said a replanting scheme would ultimately result in more trees at the site.</p>
      <p>Ward councillorAshley Dearnley, said problems he had long warned of had ‘come true’ - but conceded it was an improved scheme and the developer had been responsive to resident’s concerns.</p>
      <p>“Whilst I can never say I support development on this site - I fought tooth and nail against any development on the site - we are where we are and have to make the best of the situation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But if this is a better plan - which the (campaign) group  I was involved with seems to think it is - and as long as it gets carried out effectively and those concerns are met of people that live there -  then it’s for you (the committee) to determine the application.”</p>
      <p>The proposed development is made up of a mix of 53 four-bedroom, 35 three-bedroom and eight two-bedroom houses - including 15 affordable homes.</p>
      <p>There will also be a play area in the centre of the site.</p>
      <p>The meeting of Rochdale council’s planning and licensing committee was held at Number One Riverside on Wednesday, November 28.</p>
