      <p>Spanish online newspaper El Confidencial published Friday the 80-year-old Spanish opera legend’s first interview since <i>The Associated Press</i> earlier this year reported allegations of sexual harassment made by multiple women against him.</p>
      <p>Domingo denied the allegations. He says Spaniards are naturally “warm, affectionate and loving,” adding that he has always been “gallant” but “gallant gestures are viewed differently nowadays.”</p>
