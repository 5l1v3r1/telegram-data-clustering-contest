      <p>Former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns defender Siyanda Xulu is one of the best defenders in the league, and having recaptured his best form with Maritzburg United, has managed to remind fans what he has to offer. </p>
      <p>Off the field, the 27-year-old gets around in a classy Mercedes-Benz that is sure to turn heads wherever he goes.</p>
      <p>His resurgence with the Team of Choice has seen him return to the Bafana Bafana setup. So impressive has the former FC Rostov man been that he even managed to marshall the KZN’s team’s midfield on the odd occasion.</p>
