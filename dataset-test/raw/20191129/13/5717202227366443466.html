      <h1>Report: West Ham monitoring Arsenal interim manager Freddie Ljungberg</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:15:19+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/29/arsenal-sack-unai-emery-freddie-ljungberg">The Guardian have claimed</a> that West Ham United are monitoring Arsenal interim manager Freddie Ljungberg despite the Swede taking over from Unai Emery, after the Spaniard was sacked by The Gunners on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Emery was relieved of his duties after suffering a 2-1 home defeat to Eintracht Frankurt. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had given his side the lead, only for Frankfurt to score twice in the second halfand succumb Emery to defeat.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have now failed to win in their last seven games and Ljungberg will be tasked with ending that run this weekend, when the Gunners take on Norwich City. It is believed that the Arsenal role would be Ljungberg’s dream job.</p>
      <p>He has rapidly progressed through the world of coaching in the last three years. Starting off as Arsenal’s Under-15 coach, Ljungberg has progressed to Under-23 gaffer and Wolfsburg assistant before being promoted to the senior staff.</p>
      <p>Now, he has the chance to stake a claim for the Gunners job but West Ham – whom Ljungberg played for 26 times during 2007-08 – are also interested in the Swede with Manuel Pellegrini struggling in the Hammers hotseat.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Would Ljungberg be a good West Ham appointment?</h3>
      <p>He knows what it means to the West Ham fans and he knows the identity of football that the Hammers try to play. But with no senior experience and Ljungberg obviously more of an Arsenal supporter, would a move be beneficial for West Ham?</p>
      <p>West Ham are close to the relegation zone and they need a manager that can keep them adrift. Hiring Ljungberg, 42, would be a massive risk given he has no experience as a senior manager and it could see them fall even further.</p>
