      <p>India’s GDP growth slipped to a 26-quarter low of 4.5 per cent in the second quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal, data released by National Statistical Office (NSO) Friday showed. The GDP growth rate has now slowed for the sixth consecutive quarter with the previous low recorded at 4.3 per cent in March 2013. The July-September growth rate of Gross Value Added (GVA), which is GDP minus net product taxes, has slowed to 4.3 per cent as against 6.9 per cent a year ago. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/indias-gdp-growth-slips-to-26-quarter-low-of-4-5-6142813/">Read more here</a></p>

      </p>
      <p>At 4.5 per cent, the GDP growth rate is much lower than 5.3 per cent projected for July-September by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its October policy. For the country to clock a growth rate of 5 per cent for the full 2019-20 financial year, it would now have to grow at least 5.2 per cent in the remaining two quarters of this fiscal. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-gdp-rate-at-4-5-pc-now-makes-rbi-projection-hard-to-achieve-6143112/">Read more here</a></p>

      <p>Johnson writes and directs this story, set in Agastha Christie mould, with fewer twists than one expects. The centrality of its surprise, in fact, lies in how simple and straightforward it is. It may not give you the thrills of having solved a crime ahead of the filmmakers, but the film might just reinforce your faith in the goodness of hearts, without the burden of any deep-set sociological analysis. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/knives-out-movie-review-daniel-craig-chris-evans-6142958/">Read more here</a></p>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> MP Pragya Thakur Friday said her Nathuram Godse remark was taken out of context, adding that former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi should tender an apology for calling her a “terrorist”. “If my statements have hurt anyone, then I would like to apologise.

      <p>A misfield by Pakistan’s Shaheen Afridi on Day 1 of the Adelaide Test summed up the day for the visiting team on Friday. Afridi, who was ironically the only bowler to get a wicket on the day, as Australia pulverized Pakistan into submission by putting on 302/1 by Stumps, was trolled on social media for what looked like kicking the ball into the boundary for a four. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-fielding-shaheen-afridi-kicks-ball-for-boundary-watch-video-6142961/">Read more here</a></p>
