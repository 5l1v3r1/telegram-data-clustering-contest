        <p><i>“I really feel sorry that what happened on Sato I didn’t like it. I don’t like violence. What happened to you was unfortunate and she shouldn’t have done that. Nobody should do that to any other person and I apologize on her behalf and she apologized to me in the morning,”</i> said Kibe.</p>
        <p>Kamene Goro while narrating the incident, noted that the lady who had accompanied Kibe for the weekend was entertaining them, when she started hurling insults at their producer Xtian Dela before turning to her later on.</p>

          <p>Bootylivious Model Jane Rimoy aka Sanchoka distanced herself from a leaked sex-tape that has gone viral in Tanzania.</p>
          <p>In an update on her social media pages, the curvaceous socialite, cautioned her followers not to fall for the fake videos that were being circulated, purporting to be hers.</p>
          <p>She pointed out that it's clear the features appearing in the video don't match her body type and therefore people should refrain from associating her with the said clips.</p>
          <p>Unless you have been living under a rock for the last 10 years, you have come across one of the most bodacious booties on the internet, that of Sanchoka who has mastered the art of thirst-trapping.</p>

              <p>Diamond’s producer Lizer Classic has disclosed that he can’t work with Harmonize after he left the WCB Wasafi label.</p>
              <p>Speaking to a Tanzanian radio station, Lizer clearly stated that he cannot work with the Uno singer, because he is no longer part of the WCB family.</p>
              <p>He went on to say that he is an employee of WCB and once one leaves the record label, they lose the privilege of having his services.</p>
              <p><i>“Ni msanii mzuri Harmonize na kuondoka kwake pia mimi kama producer naona haina maana, kwa sababu akiondoka huwezi kufanya naye kazi. Mimi siwezi kufanya naye kazi tena kwa sababu tayari hayupo WCB. Mimi ni producer wa WCB kwa hivyo ambaye yupo nje ya WCB ambaye alikuwa WCB siwezi kufanya naye kazi. Sikatazwi lakini kiubinadamu, ukifanya naye kazi huwezi kuonekana vizuri,” </i>he said.</p>
