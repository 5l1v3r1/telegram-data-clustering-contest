      <h2>Delays on the way for users of this route</h2>

      <p>Drivers are being warned about upcoming roadworks which will mean a diversion route of just over nine miles.</p>
      <p>The closure will be in place on the road near the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/environment">Staunton Harold Reservoir crossing</a> , which sits just off the B587, Melbourne Road, near Ticknall and Melbourne.</p>
      <p>Works will be carried out by utilities firm Severn Trent Water.</p>
      <p>The firm will be carrying out the "refurbishment of equipment within the manhole chamber", according to roadworks collaboration website one.network.</p>
      <p>A road closure will be in place for four days, in the new year from Monday, January 20, until Friday, January 24.</p>
      <p>A recommended diversion route stretches 9.1 miles, according to Google Maps, and will take 14 minutes to drive.</p>
      <p>The diversion route will <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">take motorists from</a> one side of the closure to the B587, where they should turn right.</p>
      <p>Follow the road to Nottingham Road, just before the A42, and turn right again.</p>
      <p>This will take you into the roundabout in Ashby, connecting the route to the A511.</p>
      <p>The third exit of the roundabout should be taken onto the A511 and followed to the next roundabout, where the third exit should be taken again onto first Smisby Road, then the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">B5006 Derby Road</a> .</p>
      <p>Following this, before taking a return right onto Heath Lane, which travels through Heath End. Turn right again just after Dumelows Dairy Raw Milk Vending, before reaching the middle of Calke to return to the other side of the closure.</p>
