      <p>World's tallest statue -- Statue of Unity -- is twice the size of Statue of Liberty. This statue will be modified a bit soon. Two new doors are being constructed on the feet of the statue apart from modern cranes being deployed to clean the statue.</p>
      <p>Each door will be 2.1 metre high and 1.8 metre wide.</p>
      <p>To clean the 182-metre-tall statue, two advanced cranes are deployed.</p>
      <p>Given the difficulties experienced while cleaning the Statue of Unity, these grab bucket cranes are being used to maintain the statue's cleanliness.<br/>The two feet of the statue are also being carved to make two new gates there. One of the gates will have a lift and another one will have a staircase.</p>
      <p>The lift and the stairs will be used as emergency exits in future for the people at the viewing gallery inside the Statue of Unity.</p>
      <p>Narmada Corporation chief engineer PC Vyas said that there are two elevators in the gallery apart from two ladders for an emergency situation already. But two more special doors are being constructed to exit the place in case of an emergency.</p>
      <p>The Statue of Unity was visited by 29 lakh people in the past one year.</p>
