      <h1>Liverpool FC confirm Fabinho injury blow amid Man City title race</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City are battling Liverpool for the Premier League title and Jurgen Klopp's side have suffered an unfortunate injury setback.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:26:50+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:26</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Fay, https://www.facebook.com/RichFayMEN/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool could be without key midfielder Fabinho for up to eight weeks, the club have confirmed.</p>
      <p>Brazil international Fabinho suffered ankle ligament damage during the Champions League encounter with Napoli in midweek and is now expected to be out until the New Year.</p>
      <p>The central midfielder was substituted just 18 minutes into Liverpool's 1-1 draw against Napoli on Wednesday night after damaging his ankle during a challenge.</p>
      <p>A statement from Liverpool read: "Further assessment on the injury has discovered Fabinho will be out of action until the New Year.</p>
      <p>"The Brazilian will begin a rehabilitation programme with the Redsâ€™ medical team at Melwood as he works his way back to full fitness."</p>
      <p>Fabinho has formed a key role for Jurgen Klopp's side this season and has played the entire 90 minutes in 11 of their 13 Premier League matches this campaign.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has contributed one goal in the league this season, with a thunderous strike in Liverpool's 3-1 victory over City at Anfield earlier in November.</p>
      <p>Fabinho's setback comes as a big blow for Liverpool ahead of a packed festive fixture schedule which will see them face Everton and Leicester, as well as compete in the annual FIFA Club World Cup tournament.</p>
