      <p>Adrian Edmondson has dropped a huge hint he will return to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a>.</p>

      <p>While she now<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-viewers-saddened-as-jean-is-told-daniel-has-passed-away/"> believes he has passed away,</a> viewers saw him after he faked his own funeral.</p>
      <p>And Adrian has now admitted he could be back in Albert Square.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a>: "He's technically alive, and who knows whether he will come back or not [winks]?</p>

      <p>"He's definitely not dead, that's all I'm allowed to say."</p>
      <p>The Bottom star also revealed he could see his and Gillian's storyline being turned into successful spin-off.</p>
      <p>He added: "It's cracking. It was offered as a story of this bloke.</p>
      <p>"And if you cut our bits together it makes a nice series of its own I think."</p>

      <p>Adrian previously admitted he was following in the footsteps of his fellow drama school students Tom Watt and Paul Bradley in joining the soap.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement: "There were only fifteen boys on my drama course at Manchester Uni, and I'll be the third to appear in EastEnders - so I feel it's a kind of tradition! The other two being Tom Watt (Lofty Holloway) and Paul Bradley (Nigel Bates)".</p>

      <p>Executive producer Jon Sen added: "Adrian's a phenomenal talent who will bring his unique blend of intelligence, warmth and humour to the role of Daniel.</p>
      <p>"We're all over the moon he's coming to Walford and can't wait for this love story to hit screens later this year."</p>
