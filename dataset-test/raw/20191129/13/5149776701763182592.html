      <p>A driver had a very lucky escape after their car flipped onto its side.</p>
      <p>The accident took place on the A6096 Ladywood Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ilkeston">near Ilkeston,</a> after black ice caused issues across Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>Cops confirmed that no-one was injured in the accident which took place at the road's junction with Arbour Hill, in Dale Abbey, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/lucky-escape-after-van-flips-3590371">reports DerbyshireLive.</a></p>
      <p>Erewash Response Unit tweeted this morning to report the crash and warn other motorists of the tricky conditions on the roads this morning.</p>
      <p>The unit posted just before 6am to say: "A stark reminder to drive to the conditions. There is a lot of black ice on the roads this morning as this driver discovered. Single vehicle RTC with no injuries on the A6096 Ladywood Road, junction of Arbour Hill."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">The Met Office </a>has predicted that it is likely there will be some icy stretches, with the weather warning set to remain in place until 10am.</p>
      <p>On what to expect from a yellow ice warning, the Met Office say: "Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.</p>
      <p>"Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths."</p>
