      <h1>U.K. prime minister skips climate debate so TV station replaces him with block ice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:11:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters </a></address>
      <p>LONDON — British broadcaster <a href="https://www.channel4.com/">Channel 4</a> represented <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/boris-johnson-may-just-have-met-his-match-voting-public-n1089436">Prime Minister Boris Johnson</a>with a block of melting ice in a prime-time election debate on the environment on Thursday, prompting his Conservative Party to complain this broke impartiality rules.</p>
      <p>The commercially funded public-service broadcaster invited leaders of all Britain's main political parties to take part in the debate before <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-looks-set-early-election-attempt-break-brexit-deadlock-n1073201">Dec. 12's election</a>, but both Johnson and the leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, declined to attend.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party offered former environment minister Michael Gove as a substitute, but the broadcaster said the debate was only intended for party leaders, and that the other political parties would not agree to change the terms.</p>
      <p>"This effectively seeks to deprive the Conservative Party of any representation and attendance," the Conservatives wrote in a letter of complaint to broadcast regulator Ofcom.</p>
      <p>British television broadcasters are required to be politically impartial, and face extra balance requirements during election periods. Ofcom can fine broadcasters that do not comply, and as a last resort can cancel a broadcaster's license.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives said Thursday's disagreement was "part of a wider pattern of bias by Channel 4 in recent months."</p>
      <p>The broadcaster's head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, described Johnson as "a known liar" in a major industry speech in August.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the editor of Channel 4's main news program, Ben de Pear, likened the Conservatives' approach to the media to that of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump">President Donald Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said Britain's election was parliamentary, not presidential, making it unreasonable for Channel 4 to require Johnson's appearance as a condition of the Conservatives taking part in the debate.</p>
      <p>"Put your leader Boris Johnson alongside the other leaders and stop playing games. Don't refuse and then threaten our license — it's a slippery slope," de Pear said in reply.</p>
      <p>News website <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>quoted an unnamed Conservative Party source as saying the party would call for a review into Channel 4's operating license, which is due for renewal in 2024, if Johnson returns to power after Dec. 12's election.</p>
      <p>Channel 4 is not the only broadcaster to struggle to book Johnson, whose Conservative Party is leading the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls and keen to avoid any gaffes.</p>
      <p>Johnson has so far declined to take part in a half-hour sit-down with<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> interviewer Andrew Neil, who gave tough scrutiny to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday.</p>
