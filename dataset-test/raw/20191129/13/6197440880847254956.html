      <h1>Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 9 now receiving December 2019 security patch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:07:57+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/damien9to5/" target="_blank">Damien Wilde</a></address>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Note 10 are now receiving the December 2019 security patch — ahead of the Google Pixel.</p>
      <p>Samsung is on a roll with updates recently, having started the public rollout of Android 10 for the Galaxy S10 already. Kudos to the Korean company for improving the speed of security updates. The OTA update is now heading out in over 25 European markets (via <i><a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-10-and-galaxy-note-9-get-december-security-update/">SamMobile</a></i>) for the duo of Note flagship devices.</p>
      <p>For those of you with the Galaxy Note 10, the firmware version <b>N97*FXXS1ASKB </b>is the build with the December 2019 security patch you’ll be looking for. Alternatively, if you have the Galaxy Note 9 the firmware build you’ll be awaiting is <b>N960FXXS4CSK2</b> — although the rollout has only been confirmed in Germany at present.</p>
      <p>We’re hoping that the Note 10 does get the full Android 10 update in the coming weeks after the S10 and S10+ have already started getting the full OS upgrade in some regions. If this incremental security patch is any indication, we’ll have a few weeks longer to wait for OneUI 2.0 on the latest Samsung flagship. That also lines up with the Android 10 roadmap that hints at a January 2020 release for the Note 10 — and late January 2020 for the Note 9.</p>
      <p>If you have received the December patch on your Galaxy Note 10 or Note 9, be sure to let us know down in the comments section below. Be sure to head to your device Settings &gt; System updates panel to check if you have the update waiting for your device.</p>
