      <p>A series of ads by liberal watchdog/activist group <b>Demand Justice</b> will target the Federalist Society, the law firms which support it, and Supreme Court Justice <b>Brett Kavanaugh</b>, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/6e17f0eb84ef4e2dbcc4c956727347cc">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The ads reportedly will accuse the Society of using its functions, such as a recent dinner, to “rebuild[] Kavanaugh’s image” after sexual assault accusations (which Kavanaugh denied) from <b>Dr. Christine Blasey Ford</b>. The ads argue that major law firms, which as Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, WilmerHale, and Consovoy McCarthy, are paying for Federalist Sociey events which this year attempted to normalize Kavanaugh. The ads bombastically will say the Federalist Society’s goal was to “rehabilitate a sexual predator and attack the rule of law.”  The firms targeted declined to comment to the AP.</p>
      <p>Demand Justice is led by <b>Brian Fallon</b>, who the AP notes worked for Democrats Hillary Clinton and Sen. Charles Schumer of New York.  The group has undertaken other protests against Kavanaugh, such as <a href="https://demandjustice.org/activists-protest-federalist-society-dinner-honoring-kavanaugh-by-calling-back-to-christine-blasey-ford/">playing Dr. Ford’s testimony</a> outside Federalist Society events.</p>
      <p>Much has been written about whether politicians are (or are not?) using the Federalist Society to help shape the judiciary at the <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/11/29/desantis-is-reshaping-floridas-courts-with-the-federalist-societys-help/">state</a> and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-takeover-courts-supreme-court-mconnell-federalist-society-menashi-909799/">federal</a> levels.  Less has been written <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/federalist-society-federal-judges-unethical.html">about whether</a> judges and law clerks who engage with the Society or others like it are committing behaviors unbecoming of the judicary.</p>
