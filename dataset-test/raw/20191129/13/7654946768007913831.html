      <h1>Trump blasts Newsweek over story on his Thanksgiving plans</h1>

      <p>President Trump slammed Newsweek over its story on his Thanksgiving plans, which the mag said would include “tweeting, golfing and more” — before he ended up making a surprise visit to US troops in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the mag told The Post that the “journalist responsible has been terminated.”</p>
      <p>“I thought Newsweek was out of business?” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1200224161576017921">the president wrote</a>, quote-tweeting his son Donald Trump Jr.’s <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1200189112952795139">photo of the commander in chief</a> serving Thanksgiving dinner to the service members at Bagram Airfield, north of Kabul.</p>
      <p>Attached to the image was a screenshot of Newsweek’s Thursday morning story, with the headline: “How is Trump spending Thanksgiving? Tweeting, golfing and more.”</p>
      <p>The report began, “As with any other day of the year, Trump will probably be tweeting, or expressing his opinions in another way.”</p>
      <p>Fake news gonna fake!” Trump Jr. wrote.</p>
      <p>In an updated version of the article, Newsweek added the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/28/trump-makes-surprise-visit-to-afghanistan-to-see-u-s-troops-on-thanksgiving/">president’s first trip to Afghanistan</a> as president to the top of the story.</p>
      <p>“President Donald Trump made a surprise trip to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day and said he had reopened negotiations with the Taliban,” <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-thanksgiving-plans-maralago-1474518">the updated story read</a>.</p>
      <p>“Newsweek investigated the failures that led to the publication of the inaccurate report that President Trump spent Thanksgiving tweeting and golfing rather than visiting troops in Afghanistan,” a spokesperson told The Post in an email.<br/>“The story has been corrected and the journalist responsible has been terminated. We will continue to review our processes and, if required, take further action.”</p>
      <p>During his trip, Trump met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and announced the restart of peace talks, as well as a planned reduction of US troops in the country.</p>
      <p>“It’s a dangerous area and he wants to support the troops,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said of Trump. “He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there’s a lot of people far away from their families during the holidays and we thought it’d be a nice surprise.</p>
      <p>“It’s truly about Thanksgiving and supporting the troops.”</p>
