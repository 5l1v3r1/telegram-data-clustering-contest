      <p>Pretoria - Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said on Friday she was pleased that this year's National Senior Certificate examinations had been concluded successfully.</p>
      <p>The last papers, agricultural technology and design, were written on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“It is indeed gratifying that the 2019 National Senior Certificate examination went fairly smooth, with only a few, manageable incidents across our examination centres”, said Motshekga.</p>
      <p>A total of 790 405 candidates sat for 147 question papers in 7,416 examination centres nationwide. A further 212 learners wrote at correctional facilities. </p>
      <p>Motshekga said the examination progressed well until the final day, except for a few hiccups that include load-shedding experienced in parts of the country on the first day of the examination, and service delivery protests in the North-West which led to the relocation of learners to other examination centres.  </p>
