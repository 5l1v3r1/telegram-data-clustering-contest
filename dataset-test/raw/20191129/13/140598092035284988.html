      <p>Don’t panic about the liquid glucose. You can get it in large supermarkets nowadays (and from Ocado). It just helps to improve the texture of the sorbet, making it smoother.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>20 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 5 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>eight </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>275g ripe mango flesh</li>
        <li>Juice of 2 limes</li>
        <li>175ml passion-fruit juice (from about 12 passion fruits, though you may need more)</li>
        <li>35g liquid glucose</li>
        <li>175g granulated sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Purée the mango with the lime juice and passion-fruit juice until totally smooth.</li>
        <li>Put the glucose in a saucepan with the sugar and 450ml water. Bring to the boil, stirring to help the sugar dissolve. Leave to cool, then combine with the purée and push through a sieve. Chill in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Churn the mixture in an ice-cream machine following the manufacturer’s instructions, or pour the mixture into a dish, cover and place in the freezer. You need to remove it from the freezer and beat the mixture well, with a fork or in a food processor, about three times during the freezing process, to give you a smooth sorbet.</li>
      </ol>
