      <p><b>THE All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to expel a ‘self-proclaimed’ party member, Charles Enya who called for a constitutional amendment to enable Nigeria President, Muhammadu Buhari run for a third term in office</b>.</p>
      <p>In a press statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, he wrote that the party is currently trying to find out the status of Enya who claimed to be a party member and if he is, they shall promptly commence the process of expelling him from the party.</p>
      <p>He added that the person in question is a new enemy of the country and is most likely being sponsored by the desperate and misguided opposition.</p>
      <p>“As a party, we would not take kindly to anyone or group causing an unnecessary distraction for this administration through anti-democratic actions,” he wrote</p>

      <p>He said the party is focused on revamping Nigeria’s moribund infrastructure, growing the economy, fighting corruption, creating the right environment for teeming youths to deploy their creative energies, and providing adequate security for all Nigerians.</p>
      <p>Onilu said besides that, at the last National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Party, President Buhari didn’t mince words and he is not the type that talks tongue-in-cheek.</p>
      <p>The statement further read that Buhari outrightly said he would abide by the constitution and uphold the oath of office he took, swearing by the holy book he believes in adding that he said his advanced age has made such an idea beyond his contemplation.</p>
      <p>“The president said history would not be fair to members, if the APC collapses after his second term. What better proof is required of the President’s resolve to abide by the constitution on term limit?,” Onilu added.</p>
      <p>He said, however, the Party is, by this statement sending a strong signal to such other busybodies like Charles Enya who may be contemplating testing the resolve of our government on our mission to work for the best for our country to be ready to face the law.</p>
