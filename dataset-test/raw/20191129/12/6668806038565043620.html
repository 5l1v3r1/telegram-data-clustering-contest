      <p>Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter Suhana Khan and Chunky Panday’s daughter Ananya Panday have been pretty close friends since they were children.

      <p>During the promotions of the film, the actress revealed some interesting facts about her friend. Ananya said that she and Suhana would always participate in school plays together. While Suhana would play the lead, Ananya said she would be a moving thing in the background. She also added that Suhana is an amazing actor, a brilliant singer and a great dancer. Now that’s pretty much the perfect package isn’t? <br/><br/>Pati Patni Aur Woh is a remake of the 1978 film with the same title. Along with Ananya, the film also stars Kartik Aaryan and Bhumi Pednekar. Pati Patni Aur Woh is slated to release on 6 December 2019.</p>
