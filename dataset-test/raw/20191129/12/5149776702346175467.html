      <p>Wish it could be Christmas every day? Festive fanatics' dreams will come true - at least during December when a Nottingham bar will be launching a pop-up Christmas extravaganza like no other.</p>
      <p>The masterminds behind the city's live music venue, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/first-look-inside-new-nottingham-3393355">Billy Bootleggers</a> will be decking out upstairs bar <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/stuffed-animals-jungle-sounds-new-3517129">The Wildlife </a>with more cheesy Christmas decorations than Santa's own grotto.</p>
      <p>Promising "Nottingham a Christmas like they’ve never seen before", the bar in Weekday Cross will be transformed into a winter wonderland complete with tinsel, Christmas trees and fairy lights.</p>
      <p>Opening on Tuesday, December 3, the 'It’s Christmas Every Day Festive Pop-Up Extravaganza Bar’ will embrace Crimbo fun every day of the month with festive feasts, yuletide dancing and seasonal bevvies.</p>
      <p>Punters can expect delicious Christmas dinner with all the trimmings (vegan and vegetarian options available), seasonal movie favourites, non-stop Christmas tunes and bags of festive cheer.</p>
      <p>The pop-up will also be serving a selection of warming winter tipples including mulled wine, festive cocktails and a selection of 22 espresso martinis – the biggest selection in Nottingham.</p>

      <p>Co-owner Paul Skevington, said: "Christmas is one of our favourite times of the year and what could be better than getting the chance to celebrate it for 31 days straight?</p>
      <p>"We’ve got some exciting festive treats in store throughout the month including a selection of some of the best Christmas flicks, wintry themed quizzes and who knows, maybe even Santa and his elves will pop in for an espresso martini.</p>
      <p>“Continuous Christmas tunes and platefuls of turkey may be some people’s idea of hell, but they can suck on a humbug, as we’re fully embracing it. We’ll be bringing Nottingham a Christmas like they’ve never seen before and we can’t wait.”</p>
      <p>The pop-up will be open from 12pm to 2am each day. Tables can be booked via The Wildlife's page on Facebook.</p>
