      <p><b>Guwahati:</b> In a weird incident, the MLAs of the Opposition Congress in Assam turned up at the Assembly wearing garlands of onions on the second day of Winter Assembly Session in Guwahati on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Congress MLAs highlighting the spiraling prices of onions in the market were seen raising slogans outside the Assembly today.</p>
      <p>Speaking to media, Congress MLA Rupjyoti Kurmi said, “The growing prices will deprive the people of their staple food. Onions, which used to come for less than Rs 40 a kilo, are now coming at Rs 100 per kilo.”</p>
      <p>The MLAs also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that he has completely lost its grip on inflation.</p>
      <p>It may be mentioned that earlier during the Congress regime, Assam BJP leaders namely Prashanta Phukan, Bijoya Chakravarty staged a similar kind of protest against the price rise of onion.</p>
