      <h1>TSB Graciously Makes Way for 82 New Branches of Greggs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:20:19+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Cutlack</a></address>
      <p>A couple of traditional grim pre-Christmas job scythings are underway at the moment, with staff of the TSB bank and workers at energy supplier Npower currently expecting to receive a nice card from the boss containing a hand-drawn sad-face emoticon wearing a Santa hat and a P45.</p>
      <p>TSB has decided that late November is a great time to break the news that it's to close 82 of it branches across the nation by the end of 2020, which somehow is what astronomers tell us is also known as "next year." The bank says it's retreating from high streets as part of a reorganisation to cut costs, with 17 bank outlets to close in Scotland, 13 in the west Midlands, and even London losing 12 TSBs between February and September of 2020.</p>
      <p>Separately, energy supplier Npower is partially blaming the government's energy cap on power bills for its parent company's decision to <a href="https://www.eonenergy.com/about-eon/media-centre/eon-outlines-proposals-for-npower-to-secure-a-sustainable--business-for-the-future/">shut most of the eight locations</a> it works from in the UK and combine services with that of E.ON, a move that could leave thousands of Npower workers out of a job. [<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50585536">BBC</a> / <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/npower-announces-restructure-that-threatens-4500-jobs-11873108">Sky News</a>]</p>
