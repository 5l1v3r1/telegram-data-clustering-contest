      <h1>The returning Cardiff City star 'as good as anyone in the division' Neil Harris is desperate to get firing</h1>
      <h2>The Bluebirds boss is hopeful some key returning players can have an impact in the coming weeks</h2>

      <p>Jazz Richards has endured some rotten luck during his time at Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>The right back has been plagued by injuries and is yet to feature for the first team this season - in fact he has been forced to miss 62 games through injury in just three years at the club.</p>
      <p>But he <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-u23s-bamba-ward-17311776">put in a stellar display on Monday for the under-23s</a> against Charlton Athletic and Neil Harris, who was in attendance, was suitably impressed.</p>
      <p>Harris's predecessor, Neil Warnock, was keen to include Richards back into the fold after he looked sharp in an academy game last month, but the defender suffered yet another setback with his hip.</p>
      <p>Now, though, Harris appears excited by the prospect of the player's return.</p>
      <p>The Bluebirds boss hopes he can be the man to harness Richards' ability and reserved some special praise for the Wales international.</p>
      <p>"His abilities at right back are as good as anyone in this division," Harris said of Richards.</p>
      <p>"Can I be the manager who finally gets him fit and consistent in fitness levels? That’s my challenge with my staff.</p>
      <p>"He’s a great lad and I’ve played against him and managed against him and he’s certainly a talented footballer."</p>

      <p>Another senior figure fans have been dying to see involved in recent weeks is the talismanic Sol Bamba.</p>
      <p>Bamba is also getting up to speed following his horrendous ACL injury back in March.</p>
      <p>Harris believes the increase in intensity he has implemented since his arrival has perhaps pushed the Ivorian's return back a couple of weeks, but insisted he still has a massive part to play at the club.</p>
      <p>"They were brilliant," Harris said of Bamba and Richards' performances on Monday, "Jazz is obviously a bit further off fitness-wise.</p>
      <p>"Sol was excellent in the week, so I think we are coming in with the intensity I want to train at and Sol has just realised he was getting there, but maybe he needs a couple more weeks to get up to speed.</p>
      <p>"Sol has a huge part to play within the group, every day. In the team, on the bench, not up to speed yet.</p>
      <p>"Him and Sean Morrison are huge characters and leaders, every day I lean on them for their leadership qualities."</p>
