      <h2>Alan Smith has been speaking about Arsenal, Unai Emery and the future of the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:45:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies, Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal star Alan Smith has been reacting to the Gunners' decision to sack <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> this morning.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg will be in interim charge for the game against Norwich City but no firm decision has yet been made on who will succeed Emery on a permanent basis at <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a>.</p>
      <p>The likes of Wolves' boss Nuno Espirito Santo, Man City assistant Mikel Arteta and former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino have been linked but there appears to be no rush at the moment to announce Emery's long-term replacement.</p>
      <p>Smith, for one, has detailed the problems which need to be sorted out at the Emirates by whoever succeeds the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>"The first thing anyone has to do is organise them. In many ways it’s a similar situation to Mourinho coming into Spurs, he’s got good players and it’s easy to forget there are a number of good players at Arsenal," Smith told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Obviously in attack there is (Alexandre) Lacazette and (Pierre-Emerick) Aubameyang, there is some good young lads coming through that can be developed and, given the right manager, I think that defence can be organised much better than it has been, particularly the midfield protecting that defence.</p>
      <p>"It’s working on that, which we thought would happen when Arsene Wenger left the club and Emery came in, we thought there would be a lot more discipline in the shape of the team. If they can achieve that, you fancy that they would always score goals so it’s that basic organisation you are looking for."</p>
