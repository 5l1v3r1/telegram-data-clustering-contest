        <b>Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, an American microblogging platform, says he would be relocating to Africa for a momentary stay in 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The business mogul took to his handle to disclose his plans of moving to the continent on Thursday via a farewell after having completed his planned trip to Africa.</p>
      <p>Dorsey, who <b><a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/jack-dorsey-twitters-ceo-arrives-nigeria/">recently left Nigeria</a>,</b> had visited four nations in the continent — including Ethiopia, Ghana, and South Africa — in November to “spend time with entrepreneurs.”</p>
      <p>During his visit to Nigeria, Dorsey met with entrepreneurs and young artists, as well as Twitter board member Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, an economist and former managing director of the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Although Dorsey didn’t precisely reveal what country he would choose to stay in but he confirmed that he would be living in “Africa for about 3 to 6 months in mid 2020”.</p>
      <p>“Sad to be leaving the continent for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid-2020. Grateful I was able to experience a small part.,” he wrote in a tweet.</p>

      <p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, had similarly <b><a href="https://www.thecable.ng/videos-zuckerberg-walks-freely-on-the-streets-of-yaba">visited Nigeria</a></b>, Africa’s most populous nation, in 2015 to “listen, learn, and take ideas back to California” on how Facebook can better support tech and entrepreneurship across the continent.</p>
