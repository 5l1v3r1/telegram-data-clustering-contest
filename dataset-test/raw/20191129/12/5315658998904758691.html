      <h1>Time to move e-scooters off footpaths</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:48:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Dog_And_Lemon_Guide" target="_blank">Dog And Lemon Guide</a></address>
      <p>The decision to ban certain brands of e-scooter doesn’t mean the remaining e-scooters are safe, says the car review website <a href="http://dogandlemon.com/">dogandlemon.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Editor Clive Matthew-Wilson, who is an outspoken road safety campaigner, says e-scooters were effectively sneaked onto the nation’s footpaths without proper safety assessments.</p>
      <p>“E-scooters offer nothing that biking and walking don’t offer. It’s hypocritical for the government to say it’s worried about obesity, yet allow short-trip technology that effectively replaces exercise.”</p>
      <p>“It’s equally hypocritical to ban most bikes from footpaths on safety grounds, yet allow e-scooters.”</p>
      <p>“It’s even more hypocritical that the Green Party promotes <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/precautionary-principle">the precautionary principle</a>, which states that a new product must be proven safe before it can be released into the environment. Yet, with the full support of the Green party, e-scooters were allowed onto footpaths without any real safety assessment.”</p>
      <p>“The steady stream of accidents followed as night follows day, yet e-scooter promoters have not paid a cent towards treating the injuries caused by their scooters.”</p>
      <p>“Changing the brand of e-scooters does not make them safe. Bike riders, pedestrians and e-scooter riders are effectively in competition with each other. They need to be separate. That’s why we have cycle lanes and footpaths.”</p>
      <p>“You can’t have fast-moving e-scooters safely sharing space with slow-moving pedestrians. It’s a proven safety disaster, and changing the brands of e-scooters doesn’t alter this basic fact.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not against e-scooters. However, they need to be entirely removed from footpaths. The promoters of these scooters can then pay the full costs of implementing e-scooters into our towns and cities.”</p>
