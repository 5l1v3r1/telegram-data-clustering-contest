      <p>A man has slammed his ‘killjoy’ council for refusing to allow him to stand in the general election as Santa Claus.</p>
      <p>Dave Yates, 58, has been told he can’t campaign as Father Christmas in the Newbury constituency because it would ‘confuse and mislead voters’.</p>
      <p>He called staff at West Berkshire Council ‘Grinches’ and said that as he looks so much like Santa – with white hair and beard – it would not be confusing.</p>
      <p>Council chief executive Nick Carter confirmed to him that ‘Santa Claus’ would not be on the ballot paper in the 12 December election.</p>
      <p>Dave, who gained 300 votes while standing as himself for the Apolitical Party in 2017, is contesting the decision.</p>
      <p>If successful, it could force a by-election in Newbury in February.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Santa was hoping to stand in this election on a message of peace and goodwill to all.’</p>

      <p>Dave added ‘more importantly’ he wanted to warn voters to be aware when choosing their next MP of a ‘huge spike in borrowing to pay for all the “giveaways”<br/>being promised’ and ‘the possible catastrophic effect it could have on our grandchildren’.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the council said: ‘Yes, David Yates did seek to stand as Santa Claus.</p>
      <p>‘Candidates can use a name that they are commonly known by which is usually an abbreviation of their full name, eg Tom.</p>
      <p>‘As Mr Yates is not commonly known as Santa Claus, it was deemed to be both confusing and misleading.</p>
      <p>‘Judgements need to be made when considering all nominations and decisions taken as to whether the use of the particular name would confuse or mislead the electors within the constituency.’</p>
      <p>Heating engineer Dave said he dresses as Father Christmas at various festive events so hopes enough people will support his appeal.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘I first stood in a general election in 2010. I had formed my own party – Apolitical Democrats – trying to get away from the dogma of party politics, which was driving me mad.</p>
      <p>‘I’m just trying to make a statement that we need to get away from from party politics as we have known it for the last 50 years or so.’</p>
      <p>Dave added: ‘The fact that it was a Christmas election was just too good of an opportunity to be missed – I had already been growing the beard.</p>
      <p>‘Lord Buckethead and Count Binface are allowed to stand, so why not Santa Claus?’</p>
