      <h3>Toss a handful of sand in Rincon de Guayabitos, Mexico at any time between November and March and it may well hit someone from Saskatchewan.</h3>
      <p>Situated about an hour north of busy Puerto Vallarta, this little beach village is a winter haven for snowbirds from the Canadian prairies, offering affordable short- and long-term accommodations, a vibrant beach scene and a safe, friendly vibe — without the loud nightclubs and boozy crowds of larger coastal cities.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan licence plates can be seen on vehicles and nailed to the walls of beachside bars. Blankets, towels, hats and shirts bearing the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ colours and logo are for sale in some of the shops. Many retirees spend months at a time relaxing here, returning year after year. Some own condos in the area.</p>
      <p>I’m not retired, but I share their loyalty — I’ve vacationed in Guayabitos so many times, it feels almost like home. The owner/operator of one of the smaller hotels has become a treasured friend over many years.</p>

      <p>The beach is the main attraction. It’s a two-kilometre stretch of soft, golden sand and gentle waves that draws Mexican families to socialize and play with their kids in the water. Spontaneous soccer matches break out among the teens. Walkers and joggers leave their footprints, human and canine, up and down the water line.</p>
      <p>Not far from shore is Isla de Coral, a small island popular with snorkellers. It’s easily reachable by hiring one of the many small boats that offer rides for tourists from the beach. These same boats can also be hired for whale watching and light fishing. (Ask around with the snowbirds to determine a reasonable price before negotiating.)</p>
      <p>Activities abound. The location of Rincon de Guayabitos makes it an easy departure point for a variety of organized excursions around the Riviera Nayarit region — zip-lining, ATV tours, horseback riding, snorkelling, river tours and hikes in the lush tropical hills. Cooking classes and Spanish lessons are often available. Guayabitos is also very close to Sayulita, renowned as a hot spot for surfers, including beginners.</p>

      <p>Of course, no visitor goes hungry.</p>
      <p>Most mornings, fishermen pull their boats up onto the beach at the south end of Guayabitos and offer their catches for sale by the pound while brown pelicans swarm around them on the sand to compete for scraps. Most of the small hotels in Guayabitos rent their accommodations with full kitchens, and fresh local produce is just a stroll away at several grocery shops, so cooking your own meals is easy in this town.</p>
      <p>Later in the day, vendors with wheeled carts appear on the beach, selling an incredible variety of beach toys, umbrellas, souvenirs and snacks — so many snacks. Fresh oysters in the shell. Spicy grilled shrimp. Tangy ceviche. Peeled, scored mangos on sticks, drizzled with hot sauce or Tajin. Hollowed-out pineapples filled with chunks of fruit. Nuts, duros and pork rinds. Ice cream and candies.</p>
      <p>The waterfront is lined with understated bars and restaurants where the drinks are cheap and the food is fresh. Why not have one more margarita or cerveza while the sun goes down?</p>
