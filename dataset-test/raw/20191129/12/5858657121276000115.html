      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — Metro Vancouver teens skipped school to hit the mall this Black Friday, but they weren’t bargain hunting.</p>
      <p>Susatanabiliteens Vancouver staged a flash mob at Pacific Centre in downtown Vancouver.</p>
      <p>“We are here to take a stand against Black Friday: a symbol of the unchecked consumerism that fuels the climate crisis,” says spokesperson Samantha Lin. “We aren’t blaming individuals for needing to buy things — instead, we’re creating our own alternatives to this wasteful, unsustainable system. Dancing in the mall and in the street is a zero-cost, zero-carbon source of joy. We’re demonstrating what a sustainable world can look like: full of joy like this.”</p>
      <p>In addition to the flash mob, the group organized a clothing swap.</p>
      <p>“Clothing production and distribution contributes to over 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as human rights violations,” according to the group.</p>
      <p>Organizers with Idle no More led a round dance in the intersection outside the mall.</p>
      <p>“The round dance represents unity and healing, and the beat of the drum represents the heartbeat of the community,” says Casey Desjarlais. “Together we gather to create a circle of strength, inviting one another to participate in the building of a healthy environment for us all.”</p>
      <p>Youth-led climate demonstrations took place across the country.</p>
