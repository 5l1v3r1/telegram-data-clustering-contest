      <p>Guns are expected to be a hot item during the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>“We’re stoked. We’re ready," said Monte Dabbs of Dabbs Gun and Pawn store.</p>
      <p>Dabbs has high expectations for sales at his Southaven gun store this Friday.</p>
      <p>“We're expecting it to be big. We're gearing up. We got extra people here,” said Dabbs.</p>
      <p>Black Friday specials are already posted in the store, and for many gun buyers, they will have to fill out a background check.</p>
      <p>“We call it in to the FBI, online and they give us a proceed, delay or denied,” said Dabbs.</p>
      <p>The FBI has seen a surge in background checks to the tune of nearly 23 million so far this year.</p>
      <p>Statistics show when mass shootings occur the agency sees an increase, numbers soared in August and September after the Walmart shootings in El Paso and Southaven.</p>
      <p>The FBI doesn't track gun sales, but the National Instant Criminal Background check is a good way to gauge demand.</p>
      <p>For the first time since 1998, when the FBI first began tracking background checks, the number of applications per month has not dropped below 2 million.</p>
      <p>If Black Friday sales are as good as expected, it could break the record set in 2016 of 27.5 million background checks in a single year.</p>
