      <h3>Saskatchewan has recognized its shameful record on drinking and driving, and steps have been taken — both by government and out in the community — to improve the situation.</h3>
      <p>The next frontier for us to tackle is more the food — not the drink. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/opinion-from-one-bad-habit-to-another">The high rate of obesity in the province should be a topic of conversation and of action</a>.</p>
      <p>One in three people in Saskatchewan is considered obese, according to government statistics.</p>
      <p>We do not need to look far to find a cautionary tale on the subject. In the U.S., Otis Brawley, a Johns Hopkins oncologist and former chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, told the Washington Post that obesity could overtake smoking as the leading <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/tag/cancer">cause of cancer</a> in the next five to 10 years. He said cancer death rates have been in decline since the early 1990s, but increasingly unhealthy weights among Americans jeopardize this progress.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Cancer Society is also drawing attention to the issue, pointing out that obesity can be a contributing factor to at least 13 forms of the disease. The organization says if more Canadians had a healthy body weight, a startling 110,600 cases of cancer could be prevented by 2042.</p>
      <p>As we have discovered with drinking and driving, finding solutions to a complex issue like obesity rates will take more than shaming people and admonishments to move more and eat less. A societal shift takes efforts on a number of fronts. The government, however, can lead these efforts.</p>
      <p>On the national level, the CCS suggests the introduction of front-of-package labelling, restricting marketing to kids and introducing a manufacturers’ levy on sugary drinks. The provincial government also has a role in improving programs for childhood obesity prevention, making sure there is ready access to obesity treatment and creating educational campaigns.</p>
      <p>Citizens of Saskatchewan have changed how they see the practice of drinking and driving. Government efforts helped, but grassroots change was needed as well. Over time, we hope that a similar shift can happen in how we see diet and exercise as a necessity, and that children will grow up with a new mindset.</p>
      <p>More focus needs to be centred on this issue before that change can take place.</p>
