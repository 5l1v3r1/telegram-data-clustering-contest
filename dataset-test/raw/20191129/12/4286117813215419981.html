      <p>India's economic growth has taken a hit due to a number of factors - including slowdown in private consumption, investment and export - but the key indicator is lack of credit (money to produce goods) growth and demand in the market. The Narendra Modi government has taken a slew of reforms in recent months to boost credit in the market - focusing on offering incentives to banks to increase lending - but to little avail.</p>
      <p>These measures include slashing of the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps-gdp-outlook-lowered-to-6-1-1606191-2019-10-04">lending rate (the rate that is linked to banks' interest rates) by the Reserve Bank of India</a> five times this year, withdrawal of 'super-rich surcharge' imposed on foreign investors, exemption of start-ups from 'angel tax', an <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/psb-infusion-worth-rs-70-000-crore-to-push-loan-growth-by-15-per-cent-moodys-1591689-2019-08-26">infusion of Rs 70,000 crore in public sector banks</a> and a <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/gst-council-meet-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-tax-cuts-economic-slowdown-1601151-2019-09-20">significant cut in the corporate tax rate</a>.</p>
      <p>However, analysts and experts were of the view that the government did not do enough to address the issue of slowdown in demand. They argued that declining demand is among the prime reasons for economic slowdown.</p>

      <p>The concern expressed by economists is in sync with what Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said earlier this month. She had ruled out revival of economy any time soon while asserting that the government was doing everything possible.</p>
      <p>"It is too presumptive of me to say it [economic slowdown] has bottomed out," Sitharaman had said speaking to reporters earlier this month, fueling speculation that India's economy is yet to see the worst of the ongoing downturn.</p>
      <p>Wondering what made her say that?
