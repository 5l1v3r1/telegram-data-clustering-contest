      <p>John McAreavey is speaking out about his late wife Michaela's death as he fears they will never get justice for her.</p>
      <p>The daughter of Tyrone football manager Mickey Harte was just 27 when she was brutally murdered on her honeymoon on the island of Mauritius.</p>
      <p>And now her heartbroken family have admitted they want to speak out as they fear they will never get justice for her murder.</p>
      <p>In 2012, a jury found the two men accused of her murder not guilty and nobody has ever been convicted to this day.</p>
      <p>Her husband John McAreavey has headed up a continuous effort to find her killers andÂ  says they co-operated with the investigation over the years, but is now speaking out.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Newstalk this morning he revealed: "Our approach was there is no point shouting and roaring and getting their backs up, we needed these guys on side with us,"</p>

      <p>"We felt we should just support them and give them the opportunity to right the wrongs that happened in 2012.</p>
      <p>"We felt that was our best chance at delivering justice. So that was always the main objective.</p>
      <p>"But as time went on that has just failed and failed away."</p>
