      <h2>Savings for The Witcher 3, Disco Elysium and up to 90% off some titles!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:02:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Wen</a></address>
      <p>PC gaming bargain hunters are even more spoilt for choice as <a href="https://www.gog.com/games?page=1&amp;sort=popularity&amp;tab=on_sale?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">GOG.com</a> has kicked off its Black Friday sale that includes over 2000 titles.</p>
      <p>These offers include some of the most interesting indie releases of the year to suit a variety of tastes. There's 20 per cent off the wildly ambitious psychological RPG <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/disco_elysium?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">Disco Elysium</a>, 20 per cent off stylish strategy-shooter <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/void_bastards?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">Void Bastards</a>, 30 per cent off the absurdly violent and balletic <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/my_friend_pedro?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">My Friend Pedro</a>, or 50 per cent off stealthy medieval horror <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/a_plague_tale_innocence?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>.</p>
      <p>With so many deals, there are also heavy discounts off many bestsellers and fan-favourite classics, so if you've somehow still not gotten around to picking up <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_witcher_3_wild_hunt_game_of_the_year_edition?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">The Witcher 3</a>, the Game of the Year Edition is available for just £10.59.</p>

      <p>Other notable savings that caught our eye include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>15% off Diablo + Hellfire</li>
        <li>15% off Warcraft I &amp; II Bundle</li>
        <li>40% off Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden</li>
        <li>50% off Icewind Dale 2 Complete</li>
        <li>50% off Banner Saga 3</li>
        <li>50% off Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</li>
        <li>60% off Call of Juarez: Gunslinger</li>
        <li>70% off Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition</li>
        <li>80% off Hitman: Absolution</li>
        <li>80% off Killer is Dead: Nightmare Edition</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If those offers sound impressive, there are even titles that have been discounted by up to 90 per cent! Whether or not that makes them worth playing is perhaps another matter. But when you can pick up <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/postal_2?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">Postal 2</a> for less than a Greggs sausage roll at 79p, you don't have much to lose - although you can also spend the same amount on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/unreal_tournament_2004_ece?pp=44a1b665cceda52001aa6fa3bb69d2cfefc0a91c">Unreal Tournament 2004 Editor's Choice Edition</a>.</p>
      <p>With the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-27-steam-autumn-sale-slashes-prices-on-loads-of-great-pc-gamesSteam">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-28-green-man-gamings-black-friday-sale-offers-huge-savings-on-the-biggest-pc-games-of-the-year">Green Man Gaming</a> already vying for your wallets, you'll probably want to compare storefronts for the best prices. However, GOG.com has one advantage over the rest as it remains the choice for players who want to be free from the constraints of DRM, and you'll have until December 3rd 2pm UTC to take advantage of all offers.</p>
