      <p>Grime star Stormzy has announced a world tour - and he's coming to the East Midlands.</p>
      <p>The Heavy Is The Head world tour will kick off next year and he will stop off at the Motorpoint Arena in Nottingham on Friday, September 18, 2020.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale at 9am on Friday, December 6, with prices starting from Â£40.40 at ticketmaster.co.uk, seetickets.com or motorpointarenanottingham.com, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/stormzy-announces-world-tour-including-3590711">reports NottinghamshireLive.</a></p>
      <p>The announcement follows news that the 26-year-old will be releasing a brand new album called Heavy Is The Head, a record which has been produced by the musician himself.</p>
      <p>The album also features vocals from Aitch, Burna Boy, Ed Sheeran, Headie One, H.E.R., Tiana Major9 and YEBBA with production from Fred Gibson, Fraser T Smith and T-Minus.</p>
      <p>The rapper, who famously wore a Banksy bullet-proof vest on stage at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/glastonbury-festival">Glastonbury</a> this summer, was last in Nottingham back in 2017 when he played to a sold out Rock City.</p>
