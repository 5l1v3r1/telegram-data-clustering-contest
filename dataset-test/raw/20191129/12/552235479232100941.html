      <p>A crossbow killer is likely to die in prison after being jailed for 33 years for shooting his heavily <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/pregnant-mum-five-shot-dead-13583975">pregnant ex-wife</a> in a "brutal and evil" revenge attack.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/obsessed-crossbow-killer-shot-pregnant-20935985">Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo</a> , 51, burst into the home of eight months pregnant Sana Muhammad and fired an arrow into her stomach as she fled upstairs.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad, 35, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died.</p>
      <p>Her unborn son - her sixth <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">child</a> - was delivered by Caesarean section and miraculously survived.</p>
      <p>A jury rejected the defendant's claim it was an accident and found him guilty of murder after four hours of deliberations last week.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Judge Mark Lucraft QC sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 33 years.</p>

      <p>He described the killing of Mrs Muhammad as a "brutal and evil attack", saying if it was not for the presence of her children he would have shot her new husband Imtiaz too.</p>
      <p>He told the defendant: "You have carefully planned this attack. You had two loaded crossbows and I'm entirely satisfied you intended an attack on Sana and then on Imtiaz.</p>
      <p>"One can only assume that you were jealous of their life together and the fact that they had formed a loving bond between themselves and with your children.</p>
      <p>The judge said the crossbows and bolts the defendant acquired do not require a licence and can be bought online."</p>
      <p>He said: "As is shown by events that followed, they can be used to devastating effect to kill.</p>
      <p>"Many I am sure will find the ease with which some items are available deeply concerning - it is for others to consider whether these items should be controlled and require a license for ownership."</p>
