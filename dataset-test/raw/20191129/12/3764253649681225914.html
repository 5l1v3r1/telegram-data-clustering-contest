        <b>Freddie Ljungberg's reign as Arsenal's interim manager could come to an end in the next 12 weeks due to him not currently having Pro Licence certificate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 42-year-old former Swedish footballer currently has UEFA A Licence and he will need to have Pro Licence for him to become the permanent manager at the Emirates stadium.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/arsenal-fc-news-now.html">Arsenal</a> on Friday afternoon, November 29, sacked Unai Emery because of the Gunners' poor form of run this season in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery invited the anger and frustration of Arsenal board after the Gunners lost 2-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday night, November 28.</p>

      <p>And after the encounter, Arsenal fans protested for Unai Emery to be sacked and he was subsequently kicked out by Arsenal chiefs.</p>
      <p>As it stands presently, Freddie Ljungberg's current A Licence can only propel him to manage Premier League games and other competitions until the end of February 2020.</p>
