      <h1>Bushiri’s fraud case transferred to High Court for trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:06:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Canny Maphanga</a></address>
      <p>The fraud case against Enlightened Christian Gathering Church leader Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary has been transferred to the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria for trial. </p>
      <p>Bushiri and his wife made a very brief appearance in the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court on Friday morning to receive notice of trial.</p>
      <p>Bushiri, who is also known as "Major 1", was welcomed by his many supporters who blocked off the road ahead of his appearance. </p>
      <p>The couple face charges of fraud, money laundering and the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act for offences they allegedly committed from 2015.</p>
      <p>One of the charges relates to exchange control regulations and involves foreign currency of $1 147 200 (around R15m at the time), News24 reported.</p>
      <p>Bushiri recently made headlines after <b><a href="https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/botswana-lifts-prophet-bushiris-visa-restrictions-20191107">Botswana </a></b><a href="https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/botswana-lifts-prophet-bushiris-visa-restrictions-20191107"><b>lifted</b></a><b><a href="https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/botswana-lifts-prophet-bushiris-visa-restrictions-20191107"> his visa restrictions. </a></b></p>
      <p>This followed by the government of Botswana deregistering Bushiri's church in the country in December 2017.</p>
      <p>Bushiri praised the country for its "progressive move", but this was short-lived as the country has since decided to close down all of his church branches following the deregistration of the organisation last year.</p>
      <p>The pair will go on trial in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria between July 27 and August 28 next year.</p>
