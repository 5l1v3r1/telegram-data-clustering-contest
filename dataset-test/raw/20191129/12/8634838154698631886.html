        <b>Joseph Irungu alias Jowie surprised his fans on Friday, November 29, after activity was noticed on his social media accounts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Irungu, who is facing charges in the gruesome murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani, has been in remand since September 2018.</p>
      <p>However, a photo of him and a girl whose name is not identified was posted on his Instagram account.</p>
      <p>The image showed both of them enjoying themselves at an entertainment joint.</p>

      <p>Further, previous photos of Irungu and his fiancée Jacque Maribe (who is also facing charges in the murder case of Monica Kimani) were deleted.</p>
      <p>On the comment section, most of his followers were happy that he was back on social media while others wondered whether he had been released from jail.</p>
      <p>The social media activity raised eyebrows from people who could not tell whether the suspect was using his account in detention or had given someone else access to it.</p>
      <p>"All of Maribe's photos have been deleted," Catie noted.</p>
      <p>"Welcome back," Gadafi Shariff stated.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, November 28, Justice James Wakiaga directed that Irungu's bail application ruling would be heard on February 13, 2020, meaning that he would yet again spend the Christmas holiday locked up at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.</p>
      <p>Irungu had filed for a fresh bail application, claiming that he was suffering behind bars. </p>
      <p>On October 30, 2018, Justice Wakiaga denied Irungu bond, on grounds that he might interfere with witnesses.</p>
      <p>His co-accused, former news anchor Jacque Maribe, was released on a Ksh2 million bond or Ksh1 million cash bail, with three sureties.</p>
