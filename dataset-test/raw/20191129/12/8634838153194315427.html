        <b>Is there anything more disappointing than a blurry selfie with the celebrity whom you’ve always wanted to show off to your friends? In a fleeting second, you managed to capture their attention to pose for a picture for your Instagram stories.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But alas! The faces are not recognisable in the dull light and you only took one picture!</p>
      <p>If this is your many nights out where you had hoped to make a social statement, you need an upgrade. Don’t worry though the Oppo Reno2 F has got your back.</p>
      <p>The Reno2 F is equipped with the most powerful night mode camera. With Ultra Night Mode 2.0, the gadget offers greater adaptability to a wider range of lighting intensity and light ratios. This new feature means no more ghost images even in low light - simply put, no more bad pictures! </p>

      <p>It’s this particular phone's 48MP Quad camera that could very well see it dominate the market.</p>
      <p>The pop-up camera (which is a really cool feature) packs a powerful punch with crisp portraits photos, capable of producing soft and scenic backgrounds, while still maintaining a sharp-looking subject and with crystal-clear skin tones and a rich vein of detail.</p>
      <p>Its ingenious ultra-large aperture -f/1.79, has been crafted to add dimension to your photos by giving you control over the depth of field.</p>
      <p>Black tones are well-defined, whites are bright yet clear, while the rest of the colour gamut is clean-cut. </p>
      <p>Reno2 F's cameras produce detailed and vibrant shots, even under challenging conditions, making it the ideal partner to bring along on those weekend road trips.</p>
      <p>The phone has a distinctive portrait mode feature dubbed ‘Portrait Bokeh, which gives one the ability to adjust the level of blur before taking a shot, bringing some much-needed artistry to phone photography.</p>
      <p>When it comes to design, Reno F2 brings home the gold when compared to its direct competitors - this is mostly due to its unbroken panel of the screen, with no cameras or notches.</p>
      <p>Its 6.5-inch AMOLED Gorilla Glass display used on the Reno 2 looks rather good due to the sheer uninterrupted canvas that it offers due to the all-screen design.</p>
      <p>When you flip the sleek handset over, the first thing that stands out is the constellation of cameras.</p>
      <p>However, what makes its seemingly simple design stand head and shoulders above the competition, is the fact that the cameras are buried within the device, giving it a very flat and seamless profile.</p>
      <p>Notably, the phone has a fast-charging 3.0 charging port, which allows for up to 51% charge in as little as 30 minutes, allowing for 13 hours of continuous video playback.</p>
      <p>The Reno2 F hits a nice balance between price, performance and cool, yet practical features - packing 8GB worth of RAM and 128GB ROM.</p>
      <p>Equipped with the ColorOS 6, users are guaranteed the most intelligent system experience, featuring a whole new customizable interface, from the home page to app icons, font sizes and background colours t.</p>
      <p>With an in-built game assistant streamlined notification management, screen record and other specialized shortcuts, this new phone makes it super easy to check and reply to messages quickly while gaming.</p>
      <p>Think the phone couldn't get any cooler? Think again. The Reno2 F is fitted with Dolby Atmos - the future of sound technology. </p>

      <p>The intricate configuration of this particular system results in a sound that feels as though it’s coming from the room you’re sitting in. Raindrops can be heard hitting individual leaves, helicopters sound as though they’re flying above you.</p>
      <p>Its in-built Smart Video Editor (SOLOOP), will change the way users edit their videos with sleek easy to use templates.</p>
      <p>The feature automatically recognizes 80 different scenes including animals, plants, and nature and neatly categorizes all of your life's precious moments, making accessibility as easy as A, B, C.</p>
      <p>In terms of security, the phone has a hidden fingerprint unlock 3.0 system that will ensure no one gets to go through your personal files and photos without consent.</p>
      <p>Speaking of safety, the phone has a unique feature dubbed ‘Riding Mode’. Upon activation, the phone automatically texts back to decline calls and mutes all notifications, to allow the user to focus when out on the road.</p>
      <p>The phone also has a Smart System Management which intelligently stops the apps which have been idle for a while in order to save power, for longer battery life.</p>
      <p>Retailing at Ksh39,999, you can get the phone in two ways either by pre-ordering at various outlets in the country or by purchasing in the outlets from This Date.</p>
