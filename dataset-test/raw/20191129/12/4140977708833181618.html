          <p>During the first semi-final of the ongoing season of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy between Haryana and Karnataka in Surat, Karnataka fast bowler Abhimanyu Mithun bowled a record-breaking last over to dismiss as many as five Haryana batsmen.</p>
          <p>The magnificent over saw the 30-year old bowler registering a maiden T20 hat-trick along with his second T20 five-wicket haul.</p>

                      <p>Haryana captain Amit Mishra (0) became the next batsman to get out to Mithun in the attempt of hitting him for a big shot. While Mithun bowled a wide and conceded a single on the following delivery, he picked another wicket on the last delivery of the innings in the form of Jayant Yadav (0).</p>
                      <p>Haryana, who looked set to cross the 200-run mark in the first innings, had to eventually settle for 194/8 on the back of Mithun registering bowling figures of 4-0-39-5.</p>
