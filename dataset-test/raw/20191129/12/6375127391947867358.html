      <h3>SPEAKER Alan Peter Cayetano alleged that  a group is trying to sabotage the committee handling the 30th Southeast Asian Games and intends to destroy the reputation of the Duterte administration.</h3>
      <p>In a radio interview, Cayetano, chairman of the Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committee (PHISGOC), said there is an attempt to bribe media to malign the hosting of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>“Mayroon naman talaga, ang nagsabi sa akin sa media may umiikot na pera para siraan pero walang tumatanggap dahil para sa bansa ito. Kaya panay website na anonymous ang naglalabas,” Cayetano said.</p>
      <p>The House Speaker clarified that because a certain group failed to bribe the mainstream media to execute the black propaganda, it resorted to social media by spreading fake news.</p>
      <p>He said after the SEA Games he is willing to face any probe, however he warned the detractors that they will also be investigated.</p>
      <p>“Sa December 12 imbestigahan nyo ako, haharap ako.  Hindi ko ituturo ang sinumang PHISGOC. Pero at the same time yung nago-operate ngayon at nakita na namin kung sinong PR-man nito, maghanda rin kayo dahil kasama kayo sa imbestigasyon,” Cayetano said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the reports about kikiam served to athletes, poor accommodations and Philippine flag used as table cloth in a buffet were all branded as fake news.</p>
      <p>The PHISGOC, particularly Speaker Cayetano, was under fire over reported glitches in the preparation for the SEA Games despite having a P6-billion budget.</p>
      <p>According to Cayetano, all thee fake news originated from at least four Facebook accounts and website.</p>
      <p>The House leader said they already started getting evidence and have asked the help of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to arrest the people behind the disinformation.</p>
      <p>“May isang team kami ngayon na kinakalap na at baka humingi kami ng tulongsa NBI. Pero sabi ko nga focus muna tayo. Allow us to finish the hosting,” he added.</p>
