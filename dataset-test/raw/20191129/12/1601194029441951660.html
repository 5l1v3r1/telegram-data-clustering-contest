      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/saul-canelo-alvarez">Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez</a> and Floyd 'Money' Mayweather are both really big names in the world of boxing. With Mayweather apparently returning in 2020, Canelo Alvarez said that the fact that Mayweather wanted to come back to box MMA fighters is laughable.</p>
      <p>Alvarez recently talked about the matter to TMZ.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Alvarez about Mayweather: "He's not going to fight with me"</h3>
      <p>Alvarez has fought in 56 fights in his professional boxing career, where he has won 53, drawn 2, and lost only the one. The solitary loss in his career remains against the unbeaten Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. (50-0). This is something that he has always looked upon as something to avenge, but with Mayweather retired, he never had the chance.</p>
      <p>Talking about Mayweather's rumored return in 2020, Alvarez threw some shade at Mayweather.</p>
      <blockquote>“He’s not going to fight with me. Don’t worry, no. He’s going to take an MMA fighter.”</blockquote>
      <p>Alvarez is less than impressed about the fact that even if Mayweather returns in 2020, he will most probably be fighting MMA fighters since he is possibly going to be working with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/dana-white">Dana White</a> in Zuffa Boxing.</p>
