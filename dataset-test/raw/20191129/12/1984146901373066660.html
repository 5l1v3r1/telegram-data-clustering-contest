      <p>It could be the moment which defines this General Election.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson, facing an intense grilling, admits something which will horrify a nation of pie and pasty lovers.</p>
      <p>Our Prime Minister - shortly after boasting he was just about "made of Greggs" - showed that he doesn't have a clue how much a Greggs sausage roll costs.</p>
      <p>The millionaire Conservative Party leader thought they were £1.90.</p>

      <p>However, even his closest store in Westminster, the humble Greggs sausage roll is £1.30.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the country, the lunchtime favourite usually costs around a quid.</p>
      <p>The car crash moment unfolded in an LBC Radio interview with Nick Ferrari, who asked if he knew the price.</p>
      <p>"Oh god, err, I don't know, umm, I give up," replied Boris.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson showed himself to be something of a doughnut when it comes to knowing how much the most basic of Greggs products actually cost.</p>
      <p>The host replied: You have no idea? You just told me you're 'made of Greggs'. You must eat their sausage rolls all the time."</p>
      <p>However Mr Johnson shrugged: "I don't know. £1.90. I have no idea."</p>
      <p>Time will only tell if the revelation will be as damning to his campaign for No. 10 as Ed Miliband's bacon sandwich incident.</p>

      <p>With recent polls showing the Tories ahead and with polling stating they are on course for a majority when Britain heads to the polls on December 12, it seems it will be Boris - and not Jeremy Corbyn - cracking out the cream cakes to celebrate getting into Downing Street.</p>
      <p>And if history tells us anything, it is probably that politicians are best off avoiding pork all together.</p>
