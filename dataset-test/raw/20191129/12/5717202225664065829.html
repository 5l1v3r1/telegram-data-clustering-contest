      <h1>Report: Arsenal make contact with Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, he is first choice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:15:35+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://gianlucadimarzio.com/it/calciomercato-panchina-arsenal-contatti-con-nuno-espirito-santo">Sky Italy journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has claimed on his official website</a> that Arsenal have made contact with Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo, and that the Portuguese gaffer is first choice.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery was sacked by Arsenal on Friday morning after suffering a 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, despite Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang putting Arsenal in the lead. It has seen Arsenal go seven games without a win.</p>
      <p>Reports following Emery’s sacking have claimed that Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti, Manchester City assistant Mikel Arteta and out-of-work boss Max Allegri are all being considered by Arsenal as they look to appoint a quick replacement.</p>
      <p>But the latest report claims that Wolves boss Santo is first choice. The Portuguese gaffer has guided Wolves to promotion from the Championship, and pushed them into the Europa League in his first top-tier seaso. They sit in a lofty fifth at the moment.</p>
      <p>Super agent Jorge Mendes, who has close ties with Wolves and 45-year-old Santo, is close to Arsenal’s head of football Raul Sanllehi. It is believed contact has been made between Arsenal and Santo, and that the Gunners want Santo before anyone else.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Would Santo be a good appointment for Arsenal?</h3>
      <p>Arsenal have a squad full of egos. The likes of Aubameyang, David Luiz, Granit Xhaka, Mesut Ozil and more. The Gunners need a manager with plenty of calibre that can cope with the pressures of keeping those players out of the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Emery struggled with that. Ancelotti and Allegri have the calibre to cope with those players, but does Santo? Arguably, Arsenal need to look at an experienced manager rather than Santo.</p>
