      <p>Ernst Middendorp is mindful of the position that Kaizer Chiefs have come from and wants to remain humble as they continue their run this season.</p>
      <p>The Soweto side are sitting comfortably at the number spot on the Absa Premiership league standings, with a 10 point lead after 10 wins, one draw and one loss so far this season.</p>

      <p>Chiefs recently recorded a big 4-0 win over Stellenbosch FC at the Cape Town Stadium, this after suffering a setback when they were knocked out of the Telkom Knockout competition in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>“Basically I am not interested about yesterday or two, three days ago, it is probably part of my status, or age because time is a limited resource for me,” Middendorp told the media after the game.</p>
      <p>“It happens, a lot of people had a lot to say about it (the TKO loss), but we did it as human beings, we went in to the next game and we have to take it game by game and as I said, let’s be humble and healthy in our preparation and reflection, knowing where we come from, we have come from position nine, not achieving anything and we really prepared ourselves day in and day out.”</p>
      <p>“Of course it is disappointing not to win each and every game but we try…” he added. </p>
