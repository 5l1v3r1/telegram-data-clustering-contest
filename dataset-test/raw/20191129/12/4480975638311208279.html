      <h1>UK PM Johnson: Will keep no-deal Brexit preparations in a state of readiness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:40:21+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>While responding to a question from a reporter about dropping no-deal <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> preparations, "Many of those preparations will be extremely valuable as we come out of EU arrangements anyway," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, per Reuters.Â "So I think that they were the right thing to have done and to keep in a state of readiness."</p>
      <p>Johnson further added that he was confident that they will have a free trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020 to help the economy shake off the potential negative impact of Brexit.</p>
      <p>The British pound's reaction was relatively muted to these remarks and the GBP/USD pair was last down 0.1% on the day at 1.2900.</p>
