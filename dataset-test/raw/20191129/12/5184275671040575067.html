      <p>The next targets of <i>Bala</i> are <i>Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ramleela</i> (<b>110 crores</b>), <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/jai-ho-review/"><i>Jai Ho</i></a> (<b>111 crores</b>) &amp; <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/ae-dil-hai-mushkil-review/"><i>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil</i></a> (<b>112.50 crores</b>) and these movies will also be crossed soon.</p>

      <p>Elated with the film’s success, Ayushmann recently said: “While I have always believed in the concept of art for art sake, I do realise that for an industry to thrive and grow, it is necessary that the films do really well.”</p>
      <p>“So, more than my personal milestones of <b>100 crore</b> hits, I’m happy that I could contribute towards the growth of my industry as well as present some really good films to audiences in the process.” he added.</p>
      <p>Directed by Amar Kaushik, <i>Bala</i> revolves around the issue of premature baldness and the importance of self acceptance and love.</p>
