      <p>Freddie Ljungberg urged <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a>’s players to stick together following the club’s decision to sack <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> on Friday, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Following the 2-1 defeat at home to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eintracht-frankfurt/">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a> on Thursday evening, Arsenal’s hierarchy took the decision to dismiss Emery on Friday morning at the club’s training ground.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s latest loss means that the club are now on their worst run of form since February 1992.</p>
      <p>And in a statement released by Arsenal on Friday the club said: ‘The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.’</p>

      <p>When speaking to his players in the dressing room after their defeat to Frankfurt, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/29/unai-emery-arsenal-sacking-message-players-eintracht-frankfurt-defeat-11238106/">Emery gave no indication that he was on the verge of being sacked and urged his squad to focus on Sunday’s Premier League fixture against Norwich City</a>.</p>

      <p>Emery’s assurance of his own position at the club continued on Friday morning as he arrived to take training at London Colney.</p>
      <p>But the Spaniard was called into a meeting with Arsenal’s head of football Raul Sanllehi and their technical director Edu where he was delivered the news.</p>

      <p>Separately, Arsenal’s players were informed of Emery’s departure and according to Sky Sports, Ljungberg told Arsenal’s players to ‘stick together, turn this around and play for the shirt’.</p>
      <p>Emery was given the chance to say goodbye to the players and wish them well before Ljungberg took his first training session as interim manager.</p>
      <p>It’s reported that Emery took the decision in a ‘respectful manner’.</p>
