      <p>After <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/katie-price/judge-declares-katie-price-bankrupt/">being made bankrupt</a> earlier this week, model Katie Price has hit the headlines again.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-five has given a home to her third dog – despite the fact she has been telling friends that she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/katie-price/bankrupt-katie-price-tells-friends-she-could-be-homeless-by-christmas/">could be "homeless by Christmas"</a>.</p>
      <p>Katie's dog Sparkle gave birth to a litter of puppies in September and she has been selling the dogs for a reported £2k each.</p>
