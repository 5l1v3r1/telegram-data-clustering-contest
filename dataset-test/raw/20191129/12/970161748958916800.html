        <b>Capcom will be showing off four games in total at its Jump Festa 2020 booth late in December, including at least one unannounced title.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jump Festa may be more of an anime and manga convention, but it’s no stranger to showing off new trailers and playable demos for highly-anticipated games.</p>
      <p>It’s been revealed that Capcom has two unconfirmed titles that it plans to have at its own booth during the event, thanks to some leaks from a Japanese games magazine, as translated by <a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/unannounced-capcom-titles-to-be-playable-at-jump-festa-2020">Gematsu</a>.</p>
      <p>Recent rumours suggest that Capcom is planning to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/resident-evil-3-remake-due-next-year-next-gen-11200801/">remake Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>, following the critical and financial success of this year’s Resident Evil 2 remake, which shipped 4.2 million units worldwide and made the Resident Evil series the company’s best-selling IP ever.</p>
      <p>There’s also a possibility that we could see an old IP making a comeback, as Capcom has stated it would like to ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/capcom-awaken-dormant-ips-indisputable-success-devil-may-cry-5-10941980/">awaken dormant IPs</a>’. Some popular choices include Dino Crisis, Viewtiful Joe, and Okami. Or maybe this could even be a brand new IP altogether?</p>

      <p>Jump Festa doesn’t seem quite the right venue for a reveal as big as the Resident Evil 3 remake though, so a more likely possibility is perhaps something like Ace Attorney 7, which Capcom confirmed in 2018 and hasn’t been mentioned since or got an official trailer.</p>

      <p>But the rule of thumb for any event like this is to assume as little as possible, so the other unconfirmed title is likely to be just something like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/12/new-resident-evil-game-project-resistance-is-a-new-5v1-survival-horror-10726619/">Resident Evil spin-off, Project Resistance</a> or the Switch port of Devil May Cry 3.</p>
      <p>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, the expansion of the action role-playing game that’s already out on consoles, but won’t be coming to PC until January 2020, is the first of the two confirmed titles.</p>
      <p>The second is Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, which will contain all six games from across both series, fully remastered and with additional features. This is also due to come out in January.</p>
      <p>Jump Festa 2020 will be held 21 December to 22 December in Japan.</p>
