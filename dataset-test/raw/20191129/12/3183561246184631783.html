      <p>While the Google Pixel 3 is over a year old, it's still a really solid handset. And as we discovered, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/02/the-google-pixel-3-xl-is-rugged-af">really damn rugged</a>.</p>
      <p>It has slightly better specs than its mid-range version, the Google Pixel 3a, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/06/google-pixel-3a-australian-review/">which we absolutely adore</a>. And thanks to this Black Friday deal, you can get the flagship Pixel 3 for just $50 more than what the 3a costs.</p>
      <p>The Google Pixel 3 is now just <b>$699</b> on Amazon.</p>
      <p>Also, if you've been itching to get your fingertips on Android 10, the Pixrl 3 already has. <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/android-10-samsung-galaxy/">Even Samsung devices don't have the new operating system yet</a>.</p>
      <p>Google's Pixel 3 comes with a 5.4-inch POLED display, Snapdragon 845 processor, 2,915mAH battery, 4GB of RAM and 128GB storage.</p>
      <p>As for the battery you're looking at dual 12MP rear cameras and a 8Mp selfie cam. Not bad at all.</p>
