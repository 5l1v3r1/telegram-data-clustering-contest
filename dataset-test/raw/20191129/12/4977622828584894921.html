      <p>The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has given its go ahead for weapons procurement and development proposals to the tune of Rs 22,800 crore, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-okays-over-rs-22k-cr-military-project-deal/story-3FLc1n7CP7BxfXNA9KjOLI.html">reports </a><i>Hindustan Times.</i></p>
      <p>One of the proposals which has been cleared is to domestically produce thermal imaging night sights for the Indian Army’s assault rifles.</p>
      <p>“The sights will be manufactured by the Indian private industry and used by troops deployed on the frontline... would enable troops to undertake long range accurate engagement in dark and all weather conditions thereby enhancing the night fighting capabilities,” said a release from the Ministry of Defence.</p>
      <p>The Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for acquiring more Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft has also been revalidated, paving the way for the contract to be executed.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the top defence procurement body also gave its nod for the purchase of more P8-I maritime surveillance aircraft for the Indian Navy, as well as additional twin-heavy helicopters to be acquired for the coast guard.</p>
