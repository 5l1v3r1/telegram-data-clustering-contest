      <h1>Grab 35% off a 50-inch Samsung TV for Black Friday</h1>

      <p>TVs are always a popular buy on Black Friday, partly because they seem painfully expensive the rest of the year, especially if you've got space for a big'un.</p>
      <p>Also partly because everyone wants to see the Eastenders Christmas special in maximum detail, obviously.</p>
      <p>Amazon's got a pretty good deal on a 50-incher this Black Friday, and it's not some random Chinese brand you've never heard of – it's a Samsung, and everyone knows Samsung makes the best screens.</p>

      <p>For the next 12 hours (ending at midnight tonight, the 29th), the Samsung 50-inch Ru7100 Smart TV with HDR and 4K is down to £359.</p>
      <p>That's £7.18 per inch, which seems pretty damn good to us.</p>
      <p>Weirdly, the TV's not on Amazon Prime, but delivery is still free. The reviews are pretty good at 4.7 stars out of 5, although some people said the sound isn't amazing, so you might want to pick up a soundbar while you're at it.</p>
      <p>
