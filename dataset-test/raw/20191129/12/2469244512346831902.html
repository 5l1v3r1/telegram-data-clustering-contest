      <p>Beekeepers have said goodbye to clingfilm as they welcomed wax wraps.</p>
      <p>The Tiverton Beekeepers had a demonstration by Norma King on how to make Wax Wraps, at their November branch meeting.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the group, Norma King said: “All you need is 60,000 bees to produce you some spare beeswax - or know a friendly beekeeper - a coconut, a Bain Marie, an old iron and to follow Norma’s instructions.</p>
      <p>“Basically, you need about 200 grams of beeswax, 20 grams of coconut oil. Heat them together in a jug standing in a pan of boiling water. When melted, use a paintbrush to spread the mixture on a piece of clean cotton cloth, cover with a piece of greaseproof paper and iron away! After about 30 seconds, the wax mixture will have spread evenly and soaked into the cloth. Hey presto, you have made something in which to wrap your sandwich.</p>

      <p>“Wraps can also be used to cover containers to put into the fridge and store food.</p>
      <p>“The great thing about wax wraps is not just the fun of making your own Christmas presents, but also they can be washed in warm - not hot - water and reused many times.</p>
      <p>“Eventually, they can be composted, so no harm to the environment.”</p>
