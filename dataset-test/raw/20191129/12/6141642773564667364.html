      <p>A fire service has condemned a driver whose “mindless parking” in front of its station doors prevented one its vehicles from attending an emergency.</p>
      <p>Firefighters based at Cosham, Portsmouth, were called to a road accident on Thursday night but were unable to deploy one of their fire engines because of the parked car.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said: “Fortunately, other Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service vehicles that were mobilised were able to respond as normal and resolve the incident despite the delay to the Cosham appliance.”</p>

      <p>The fire station posted a video of the car on Twitter and wrote: “’Mindless parking award’ goes to the owner of this silver Ford Focus currently blocking in one of Coshams frontline Emergency Fire Appliances.”</p>
      <p>It then posted another video of police and a garage attending to remove the car.</p>
      <p>Cosham station manager Steve Jenkins said: “A delayed response to an incident can make a huge difference in the safety of those that need our help.</p>
      <p>“This incident highlights the disregard some drivers have for the emergency services.</p>

      <p>Deputy chief fire officer Steve Apter added: “The issue of motorists blocking the paths of emergency services vehicles is worse than ever before.</p>
      <p>“These issues are causing delays and when tackling a fire or cutting somebody out of a car, this can be the difference between life and death.”</p>
