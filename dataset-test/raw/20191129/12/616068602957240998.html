      <p>A catastrophe was narrowly avoided at a West Kelowna apartment building Friday morning.</p>
      <p>West Kelowna Fire Rescue Chief, Jason Brolund tells Castanet, "crews were called to a 42 unit apartment building on Brown Rd. after high levels of carbon monoxide (CO) were detected."</p>
      <p>The initial report came from Fortis BC and upon arrival firefighters quickly determined there were very high levels of carbon monoxide throughout the building, on all floors.<br/>The situation was immediately deemed a serious emergency and an immediate evacuation was initiated.<br/>Over 50 residents were moved to an adjacent building where they were kept warm and evaluated by paramedics from the BC Ambulance Service for further effects of CO poisoning.</p>
      <p>There were no injuries and all residents are safe.</p>
      <p>Chief Brolund says, "fire crews assisted with isolating a heating unit in the building that was suspected to be the source of the CO gas. The building was then ventilated and all residents were allowed to return to their homes about 90 minutes later."</p>
      <p>Carbon Monoxide is often referred to as “the invisible killer” because it is a gas you cannot see, taste or smell, produced by the burning of fossil fuels in cars, generators, heaters, dryers, furnaces or other appliances.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of CO poisoning include headache and nausea and Brolund reminds residents, "all homes should be equipped with at least one CO detector" and he says, "we are pleased with the outcome today, which could have been so very much worse. With the onset of winter, we urge the public to learn about Carbon monoxide safety and ensure that they and their families are protected."</p>
