      <p>The latest edition of the <a href="https://www.f4wonline.com/december-2-2019-observer-newsletter-survivor-series-weekend-mauro-ranallocorey-graves-298421">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> provided a much-needed update on the whereabouts of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/ec3">EC3</a>.</p>
      <p>Dave Meltzer noted that Carter has been out of action due to a concussion he suffered at the end of September.</p>
      <p>To describe EC3's main roster run as a massive letdown would be an understatement. The former TNA World Champion has suffered from a lack of TV time, and even when he is on TV, EC3 is either seen chasing after the 24/7 Championship along with talents from the undercard or convincingly losing matches.</p>
      <p>EC3 last wrestled on the Main Event Tapings on September 30th in a tag team match where he teamed up with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/eric-young">Eric Young</a> in a losing effort against Gran Metalik and Lince Dorado.</p>
      <p>Carter's last RAW appearance happened on the September 23rd episode of the Red brand where he lost to <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/alexander-rusev">Rusev</a>.</p>
      <p>The 2-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion signed with the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> in 2018 and moved up to the main roster by the end of the year after a brief stint in NXT.</p>
      <p>Despite being a proven main event talent in TNA/Impact Wrestling, EC3 has not received a push in the big leagues of the WWE.</p>
      <p>The only major highlight of his main roster run has been winning the 24/7 title on four different occasions, however, as we all know, that is not something to be proud of for a Superstar with the potential to be a top-tier talent.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old has been criminally underutilized and the fans are naturally clamouring for a change. With <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/paul-heyman">Paul Heyman</a> now at the wheel on RAW, we could see Superstars such as EC3 getting a deserved share of the spotlight. Heyman wants to push new faces on the brand and Carter is someone who, at the very least, deserves a shot at salvaging his WWE career.</p>
      <p>However, that's easier said than done. We still don't have an update regarding his return date, but whenever EC3 does come back, we hope to see him featured on TV more regularly.</p>
      <p>What can WWE do with EC3 going forward? A possible repackage? A manager by his side? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.</p>
