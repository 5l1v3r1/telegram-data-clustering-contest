      <h1>Lewis Long becomes first Welsh fighter to gain victory on Bellator roster with classy return win</h1>
      <h2>Pontypridd's Lew Long won via first round submission at Bellator London in Wembley Arena at the weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:59:12+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Smith</a></address>
      <p>Pontypridd fighter Lewis Long made his comeback to the cage at Bellator London last weekend following 18 months on the sideline through injury.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old MMA veteran, faced off with Walter Gahadza in a high-profile match up at Wembley Arena, in his promotional debut with Bellator MMA.</p>
      <p>And he wasted no time in getting himself back in to the win column with an impressive first round submission on the night.</p>
      <p>Despite giving up a huge size advantage to Gahadza, the Welsh grappler was able to stun the crowd into silence as he finished the hometown fighter within minutes of the opening bell.</p>
      <p>It was a dominant performance from start to finish, with the ground specialist closing the distance on Gahadza, and taking the aggressive Londoner to the mat early on.</p>

      <p>From there it was one-way traffic as the Welsh man out-muscled his opponent, transitioning to the back and forcing him to tap out with a tight rear naked choke.</p>
      <p>With the win he becomes the first Welsh fighter to gain a victory on the star-studded Bellator roster, and is currently the only fighter in Wales to sign for the global promotion.</p>
      <p>Bellator is considered the second biggest MMA promotion in the world behind the UFC.</p>

      <p>The return performance marks 18 months since the eccentric fighter injured his leg during a freak training accident in 2018.</p>
      <p>Long, who trains out of MAT Academy in Pontypridd, believes this win will be only the first of many as he begins to re-discover his form after a long spell out of the game.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was mainly trying to work on my stand up for this one, but I know as soon as I get my hands on people they seem to pass out.</p>
      <p>"It all goes quite quickly when you're in there but to be honest I'm just happy to get back to it and get a win. I've been ready to come back for a while now so it was important for me to make a statement here.</p>
      <p>"If there's another fight for me before the end of the year then I'll take it, but the most important thing for me is that I'm back in the mix.</p>
      <p>"I have a great team behind me and a gym that's looking stronger and stronger every day so I was prepared for every eventuality here. We'll enjoy celebrating this win but then look to get back in there as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Bellator London aired live from Wembley Arena on Channel 5, as the promotion continues to grow its following across the UK with a new European fight series.</p>
      <p>In the main event of the evening, fan favourite Michael Venom Page gained a stunning knockout win over Italian Gianni Melillo, and will hope he's done enough to secure a title shot with Bellator champion Douglas Lima early next year.</p>
