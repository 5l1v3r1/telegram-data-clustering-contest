      <p>Maharashtra's new CM Uddhav Thackeray has put the work on car shed inside Aarey forest on hold. Addressing a press conference on Friday, Uddhav Thackeray said that while the work on Mumbai metro will continue, car shed construction will be reviewed by the concerned department.</p>
      <p>"I have stopped work on Aarey forest car shed today. Not a single tree leaf will be cut till further notice," CM Uddhav Thackeray said as he added that the stay was only for the car shed, Mumbai Metro work will continue as before.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference a day after taking oath as the Maharashtra CM, Uddhav Thackeray said that the reality of the post was yet to sink in.</p>
      <p>"I still don't feel like I'm the CM. It will take time for the feeling to sink in. I haven't even seen the Vidhan Bhawan yet," Uddhav Thackery said.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena chief is leading the state government ruled by newly-formed Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi or Maharashtra Development Alliance government by Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress.</p>
      <p>Talking to the press, Uddhav Thackeray said that the CM post was unexpected. " I became CM unexpectedly, but I didn't want to run away from this responsibility," he said.</p>
      <p>The Aarey forest is located adjacent to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and has five lakh trees. Around 2100 trees were cut down by MMRCL to build a metro car shed in the area before the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/not-stopping-metro-shed-project-in-mumbai-s-aarey-stay-only-on-cutting-trees-supreme-court-1611525-2019-10-21">Supreme Court ordered a stay on felling on any more trees</a>. The Mumbai metro body had told the court at the time that they have already cleared the land they require and will not need to cut down more trees for the project. The apex court had not banned the work on the car shed.</p>
