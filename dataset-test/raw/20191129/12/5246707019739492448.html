      <p><b>Original Story [Tue 26th Nov, 2019 14:45 GMT]:</b> Remember <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lastfight">LastFight</a></b>? We'll forgive you if you don't, but we covered it <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/02/lastfight_looks_like_the_power_stone_sequel_capcom_should_have_given_us_already">a while back</a> when it was just a 'maybe' for a Nintendo release (it launched elsewhere in 2016).</p>
      <p>Fast forward to the present day, and the game has – according to the publisher – just surprise-launched on the console; it wasn't even mentioned as part of the North American or Europe download updates last week.</p>
      <p>Based on the French comic series <b>Lastman</b>, Last Fight is a <b>Power Stone</b>-style arena brawler where the aim is to eliminate your rivals using either your fists or nearby objects.</p>

      <p>The game apparently hit European retail stores on <a href="https://lastfightgame.com/en/devblog/">November 20th</a>, and was released on the eShop two days later. However, we've checked both the NA and EU eShops and it's nowhere to be seen – and, judging by the replies to the initial launch tweet, it would appear that other people are having the same problems. We've reached out to the publisher to find out what's happening and will update this story if we hear back.</p>
      <p>Have you managed to pick up a physical copy of the game? Is LastFight available in your region's eShop? Let us know with a comment below.</p>
