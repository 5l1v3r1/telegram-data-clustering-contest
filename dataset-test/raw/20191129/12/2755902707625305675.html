      <p>A 28-year-old man was beaten up before he was arrested for stealing biltong  and stuffing it in his underwear at OK Jason Moyo Street.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bmetro.co.zw/man-arrested-for-stuffing-biltong-in-underwear/">Eugen Moyo (24) snatched a packet of biltong</a> and stuffed it in his underwear.</p>
      <p>Unbeknown to him he was captured on closed circuit television (CCTV).</p>
      <p>When he was making his way out of the shop a security guard arrested him.</p>
      <aside>“I was alerted by my boss in the control room that Moyo had taken a packet with two biltong pieces. We searched him and found the pack in his underwear,” said a security officer who requested anonymity.</aside>
      <p>The security guard went on to say Moyo tried to flee but onlookers effected a citizen’s arrest and delivered street justice on him.</p>
      <aside>“They beat him and tore his shirt and three-quarter short. We took him to Bulawayo Central Police Station where a docket of theft was opened,” he said.</aside>
      <p>Moyo was warned and discharged after pleading guilty in court.</p>
