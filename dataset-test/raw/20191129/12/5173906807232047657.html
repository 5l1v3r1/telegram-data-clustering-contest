        <b>Portuguese football club Sporting has qualified for the Europa League round of 32 by scoring 4-0 against the Netherland’s PSV Eindhoven's team in Group D matchday 5.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aware that the triumph guaranteed the qualification, the Portuguese team on Thursday entered strongly in the match and with goals from Luiz Phellype (9th) and Bruno Fernandes (16th), having Mathieu (42nd) and again Bruno Fernandes (64th, penalty shot) the victory was secured.</p>
      <p>With this result, Sporting kept the lead of the group with 12 points, already ensuring the qualification for the round of 32, two points more than the Austrians of LASK Linz, who on Thursday won in Norway Rosenborg by 2-1 and secured the presence in the next phase.</p>
      <p>Sporting will go to Austria in the last round to discuss the first place in the group, and a draw is enough to carry on.</p>
