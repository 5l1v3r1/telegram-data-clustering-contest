      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:54:51+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Lochlin Highet, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lochlin-highet/</a></address>
      <p>Chris Burke admits he would love to end his career at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock.</a></p>
      <p>The Rugby Park winger bagged a double at the weekend during his side’s 3-0 thumping of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> as well as an assist.</p>
      <p>And now he has insisted if he’s wanted then he would be honoured to finish his incredible career as a Kilmarnock player.</p>
      <p>He said: “If I am honest I would love to finish my career here.</p>
      <p>“But that’s not up to me, that’s up to the football club and whatever direction they want to go in.</p>
      <p>“However, I wouldn’t want to stay here if it was hampering anyone else.</p>

      <p>“I have to watch what I am doing, because I don’t want to stop someone else developing as a player.</p>
      <p>“This club have been known throughout the years to develop young talent and getting them into the first-team, but at the same time I have to make sure that they are ready for that before I do eventually decide to give it up.”</p>
      <p>He added: “You are a long time retired, and my peers have always told me to try and play as long as you can, but make sure you are still enjoying it.</p>
      <p>“I still love getting out my bed and coming here every day, if you have a passion for something then you are not really working are you?</p>
      <p>“I am trying to give my knowledge and experience in the game to the younger players, experienced players did that for me and it helped me when I was coming through.”</p>
