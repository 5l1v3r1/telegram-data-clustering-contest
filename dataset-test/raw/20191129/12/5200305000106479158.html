      <p>This weekend’s release ‘Commando 3’ has got off to a poor start, with business of around 10% in morning trading in India.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Box Office India</i>, the film’s opening is said to be on par with ‘Marjaavaan’, which released earlier this month. However, the latter had good music and a popular star cast to go with it, unlike ‘Commando 3’.</p>
      <p>The first two ‘Commando’ films also opened with a similar response but picked up during their first weekend of release. ‘Commando’ opened up with Rs. 3,43,00,000 in 2013 and ‘Commando 2’ had business of around Rs. 4,51,00,000 in 2017. Whether ‘Commando 3’ will follow the same pattern, remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>‘Hotel Mumbai’ released in various languages, may do well at big multiplexes.</p>
