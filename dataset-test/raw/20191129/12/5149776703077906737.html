      <p>Nottingham Forest fans have been reacting to reports that Dwight Gayle is <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-gayle-leeds-3590454">'likely' to join the club in the January window.</a></p>
      <p>Gayle has failed to make any real impact at Newcastle United this season, despite his goal scoring exploits on loan with West Bromwich Albion last term.</p>
      <p>He was widely expected to leave Newcastle in the summer, with a whole host of clubs from the top two tiers linked. However, he remained the club with the ambition of forcing himself into Steve Bruce's starting XI.</p>

      <p>Through a combination of fitness issues and Bruce preferring Joelinton and Miguel Almiron, the 29-year-old has played less than 30 minutes in the league so far this season.</p>
      <p>With the January window only weeks away, it is expected that Gayle will once again depart from the North East and according to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1414585/2019/11/29/leeds-expect-quiet-january-despite-casilla-case-and-possible-loan-recalls-for-nketiah-and-clarke/">The Athletic,</a><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> are 'likely' to secure his services.</p>
      <p>It is believed there was genuine interest from Forest bosses in the summer who could now get their man for the second half of their Championship assault.</p>
      <p>Here's how Reds supporters on social media see the links with the Toon striker:</p>

      <p><b>Ricky Forlenza: </b>Amazing. Sign him and where going up. I am sure. COYRs</p>
      <p><b>MarcusFish: </b>Strictly short term if that’s ok......may well get us over the finishing line but cannot cut it in the prem which he’s proved numerous times. As long as we have the money to burn it works!</p>
      <p><b>Simon Allin: </b>Sign him up permanently and announce promotion!</p>
      <p><b>Mike Proctor: </b>On the basis of what we’ve seen of SL’s signings so far I’d expect him to go to Europe for signings again, but Gayle would be a pleasant surprise and should push us to top two and avoid the end of season lottery.</p>
      <p><b>@Tontonzola99: </b>That would be a great signing to be fair!</p>
      <p><b>@dj_zotov: </b>Grabban &amp; Gayle. Now that would be the best strike force in the Championship. Make it happen</p>
      <p><b>@RichWat65020170: </b>Yes please</p>
      <p><b>Carl Forsman: </b>He’d be a terrific addition</p>
      <p><b>Simon Cann: </b>get this lad we get promoted</p>
      <p><b>John Harper: </b>If Leeds get him , they will beat us to the automatic promotion places! Simple</p>
