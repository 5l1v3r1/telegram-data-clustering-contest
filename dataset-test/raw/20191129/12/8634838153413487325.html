      <h1>DP Ruto Breaks Silence on BBI Referendum Debate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:34:51+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author">John Paul Simiyu</a></address>

        <b>Deputy President William Ruto has broken his <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/33924-3-reasons-why-ruto-may-change-support-referendum-mutahi-ngunyi">silence on referendum calls</a> by some MPs allied to ODM leader Raila Odinga.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a post on his Twitter on Friday, November 29, the deputy president called for an end to wrangles that have been caused by the BBI report.</p>
      <p>He called for people to instead leave the decisions concerning the BBI to be handled by the relevant bodies, stating that it was a project meant to benefit all Kenyans and not just a few individuals.</p>

      <p>"Friends, bravado, hubris, and threats are not necessary. BBI is for all of us. Let us all agree on the implementation matrix. Institutions, departments, ministries, commissions, Parliament and the Judiciary will handle the relevant sections. Those requiring referenda, if any, be taken to people. No need for us versus them," he struck a conciliatory tone.</p>
      <p>DP Ruto's sentiments come at a time when allegations are running rife that ODM leader Raila Odinga is advocating for a referendum to ensure that the BBI report sails through.</p>
      <p><i>The Standard</i> reported on Friday, November 29, that the ODM leader had been mulling the plebiscite, in fear that MPs allied to Ruto would shoot down the proposals if tabled in the house.</p>
      <p>The fears were informed by Jubilee Party's tyranny of numbers, which could spell doom on the project that Raila believes will unite the country.</p>
      <p>Raila's fears were echoed by a number of legislators from the ODM Party who alleged that DP Ruto had hatched a plot to ensure that the recommendation don't go through.</p>
      <p>"There is a problem, let us agree. There is nothing you are telling us that we are going to Parliament to discuss the BBI report. We know very well that <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46948-powerful-woman-driving-rutos-2022-agenda">William Samoei Ruto</a> will buy all MPs and they will cause a problem in this country," Dagoretti North MP <b>Simba Arati </b>stated in a video seen by Kenyans.co.ke.</p>
      <p>The DP has, however, remained silent concerning those allegations.</p>
