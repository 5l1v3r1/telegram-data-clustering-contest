      <h1>Fergie lauds ‘brilliant’ Klopp who has LFC playing with ‘Attacking flair, excitement and imagination’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:40:23+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>It was easy to hate Sire Alex Ferguson during his time in charge of Manchester United. After all, he won 13 Premier League titles during some of our darkest days.</p>
      <p>But since his retirement, United have spiralled into also-rans, spending absurd money and ignoring what made them great under the Scot in the first place.</p>
      <p>For this reason, it’s now much easier to respect his brilliance.</p>
      <p>And Fergie has given an interview in which he’s displayed his admiration for Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola right now, lavishing the Liverpool and Manchester City managers with huge praise.</p>
      <p>Most interestingly, he declares that the styles on show ‘mirror’ the respective managers – which in many ways – they do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“I’m delighted when someone excels in the game of football, and of course coming from abroad into English football is not easy – they have really excelled themselves in that respect,” he told <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ferguson-guardiola-klopp-man-utd-17336147">Manchester Evening News</a>,” after both Klopp and Guardiola were elected into the LMA Hall of Fame.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I think that, quite rightly, they join the pantheon of great managers we have had here, and have been inducted into the Hall of Fame.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“They have been absolutely brilliant. Their teams play with attacking flair, excitement and imagination, and they have shown it in the fantastic teams they have produced.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> “Their teams mirror themselves. They have teams with courage, that play to win all the time, that play to attack all the time and that courage has got them where they are.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“If you look at the league last year and this year, it has been dominated by them, and of course Liverpool won the European Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“It’s been a great period for them, and that’s the reason we have recognised the courage of their teams.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>We couldn’t have put it better ourselves!</p>
      <p>Of course, Klopp’s legendary status is already cemented thanks to this Champions League triumph, but the one Liverpool fans all now want is the domestic title…</p>
      <p>We have an eight point lead at the top of the Premier League title, but a hectic run of December fixtures and the loss of Fabinho to injury is going to test everyone’s mettle.</p>
      <p>A win over Brighton on Saturday is absolutely crucial.</p>
