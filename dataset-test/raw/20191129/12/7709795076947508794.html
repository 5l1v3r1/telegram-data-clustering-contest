        <b>After success in the last two weeks we're restricted to just Sky Bet Championship action on our Acca hat-trick attempt, but we're backing four teams for success this weekend.</b>

      </h3>
      <p>The only away team of the four is <b>HULL</b>. The Tigers hammered promotion hopefuls Preston 4-0 in midweek and will be full of confidence as they face a Barnsley side who are bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>Onto the home teams and another side to hit four goals in the week was <b>NOTTINGHAM FOREST</b>. They sit fourth in the table and could close the gap on the top-two as they face Cardiff who have failed to win any of their nine away games this season.</p>
      <p>The <b>STOKE</b> revival hit a small bump in midweek but we're backing the Potters to bounce back as they take on a Blackburn team who have only won two of their eight games on the road - the last four of which have been defeats.</p>
      <p>Finally, <b>WIGAN</b> have come out of a rough patch of games and will be looking to return to winning ways at the DW Stadium. They face Reading - who have won just one of their eight away games.</p>
