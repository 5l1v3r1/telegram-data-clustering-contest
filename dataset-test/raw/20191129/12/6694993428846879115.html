      <p>A single dad who adopted a baby with Down's syndrome who was rejected by 20 other families said he felt 'straight away' she was his daughter.</p>
      <p>Luca Trapanese, from Naples, Italy, adopted Alba at 13 days old after her biological mother gave her up for adoption as a result of her condition, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/single-dad-adopts-baby-down-20985737">reports</a> the Mirror.</p>
      <p>She was then rejected by a further 20 families. But as soon as Luca met her, he said he knew instantly that she was his daughter.</p>
      <p>Happily, he was granted custody of her in July 2017 and their lives both changed forever.</p>
      <p>He told the BBC in a radio interview: "Since I was 14 years old, I have volunteered and worked with the disabled so I felt I had the right knowledge and experience to do it.</p>

      <p>"When I first held her in my arms, I was overcome with joy. I felt she was my daughter straight away."</p>

      <p>"But, when I first held Alba, I knew I was ready to be her dad."</p>
      <p>He has acquired more than 130,000 followers on his Instagram feed as he began documenting his daily story of raising Alba alone.</p>
