      <h1>NHS Tayside starts review of at-risk GP surgeries</h1>
      <h2>Follows abrupt closure of Bridge of Earn practice</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:29:35+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:29</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Chalmers</a></address>
      <p>At-risk GPs in Perth and Kinross are to be vetted under a widespread review conducted by NHS Tayside following recent controversy.</p>
      <p>Health chiefs launched the review to avoid a repeat of the abrupt closure of the Bridge of Earn GP surgery in August where its 3500 patients then had to be dispersed to surgeries in Perth.</p>
      <p>The thorough investigation aims to “re-invigorate” the system - possibly even leading to mergers between services.</p>
      <p>Sir Lewis Ritchie, who previously led an independent assessment of NHS Tayside’s finances, has been parachuted in to investigate a list of “at risk” rural practices.</p>
      <p>The list of most vulnerable GPs has not been made public, but Sir Lewis will visit Bridge of Earn and other rural parts of the region to gather evidence for a GP sub-committee.</p>
      <p>Grant Archibald, NHS Tayside’s chief executive, said: “We are carrying out a review of the events that compressed into the Bridge of Earn practice, so that we can learn from that experience.</p>
      <p>“I have asked Dr Jane Bruce, associate medical director of primary care, to begin a review of practices elsewhere in Tayside, that might be vulnerable.</p>
      <p>“These might be single-handed practices where an elderly GP is looking to retire, or it might be that there is an issue with the property.</p>
      <p>“The challenge is that we may need to look at GP practices coming together, or satellite services.</p>
      <p>“We have been talking to Perth and Kinross Council’s chief executive Karen Reid about the co-location of services.</p>
      <p>“For example, that could be a hub with social work as well as GP services.”</p>
      <p>An NHS Tayside spokesperson said the primary care service risk assessment project was still in its early stages: “This work will help to identify GP practices which may be vulnerable or which may need support from NHS Tayside and builds on current practice to support practices to recruit and retain GPs and build wider multidisciplinary teams.</p>
      <p>“The information gathered will be used to inform discussions with the GP sub-committee and GPs about the future provision and sustainability of GP services across Tayside.”</p>
