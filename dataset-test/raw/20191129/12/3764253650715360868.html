        <b>- BBNaija 2019 star, Tacha, has gotten tongues wagging for the umpteenth time on social media</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- The young lady recently joined BBNaija winner, Mercy, as a brand ambassador for a popular hair brand</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- In reaction to the news, Tacha took to social media to write: ‘same deal, bigger bag’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The BBNaija Pepper Dem edition was described as boring by some people even though it had many Nigerians glued to their TV screens ready to catch a glimpse of their favourite contestants living in a house for at most 99 days.</p>
      <p>Well, the show came to an end in October 2019 but the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1219307-4-types-drama-literature.html">drama</a> is definitely far from over. Two of the biggest housemates on the show, Tacha and Mercy’s fans are usually at war on social media as they try to pit one side against the other and sometimes the ex-housemates themselves encourage it.</p>
      <p>Just recently, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1279781-bbnaija-tacha-bags-endorsement-deal-hair-brand-photo.html">Tacha was announced to be the face of a luxury hair brand,</a> Royal Hairs. The news was met with jubilation from her fans and even the young lady herself scattered some tables with her reaction to the endorsement.</p>
