      <h1>17 Completely Nonsense Yet Real Packaging Examples</h1>
      <h2>From the wasteful to the redundant, here are some examples of packaging ideas gone wrong.</h2>

      <p>Packaging is a tricky thing. It is an absolute requirement in our current lives but a tricky endeavor to do right.</p>
      <p>Depending on the fragility and size of the products, packaging needs to take many varied and complex forms.</p>
      <p>Engineering those forms is not an easy task, and as such we try not to be too hard on modern-day manufacturers. However, some examples are so illogical they cannot be ignored.</p>

      <p>Here are 17 of the silliest and yet real packaging ideas we have seen. </p>
      <h3>1. The crowded umbrella</h3>
      <p>This Reddit user ordered an umbrella from Amazon. Little did he know it would arrive drowning in paper packaging. But nothing was lost! The crafty Redditor used it to make himself a paper toga.</p>

      <h3>2. The foamy charging cube</h3>
      <p>This little guy was surrounded by several layers of foam. </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>3. The redundant environmental failure</h3>
      <p>We thought Imgur user <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/wvnRhIN">thenamenonehas</a> did a great job of explaining this packaging mishap by saying: "If only bananas had robust, natural, bio-degradable packaging of their own. Some sort of peelable skin, perhaps."</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>4. The open space</h3>
      <p>I guess this tiny electronic was claustrophobic. It came in a box 20 times its size.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Over_Packaged/status/732252924823240704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>5. The individually packaged mini sausages</h3>
      <p>The title says it all. Yes, someone thought it might be a good idea to wrap in plastic every single individual mini sausage. Aside from being costly and ecologically unwise, it must be quite annoying if you want more than just one of these treats.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SEPTEMBER/sizes/sausages_packaging_resize_md.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h3>6. The broom in a coffin</h3>
      <p>Ok, the broom did not come in an actual coffin but this packaging can definitely double as one.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/dianarough/status/865522620338364416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>7. The testy candy</h3>
      <p>These individually wrapped jelly beans must be super annoying to eat and not to mention the amount of waste they generate.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/jillianiles/status/653308749306658816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>8. You won't get your pepper</h3>
      <p>I am sure these pepper manufacturers did not want to stop their clients from consuming their products. But you have got to wonder why they made the packaging so hard to open.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/plainbutpunchy/status/1036860904443404288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>9. The genuine coconut</h3>
      <p>In another case of wasting resources to package a fruit with one of nature's most resilient natural packaging, this company thought it might be wise to offer plastic covered coconuts. And please note that they are genuine coconuts.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>10. The avocado halves</h3>
      <p>We're pretty sure it would take less time to peel, cut and de-pit real avocados than it would to open these overpackaged alternatives. It would also be much less environmentally damaging.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/PaulBerton/status/704018550969798656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>11. Bananas packaged again! Now in a plastic box</h3>
      <p>Well, at least this time they put a few in a pack.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SEPTEMBER/sizes/bananas_in_boxes_resize_md.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h3>12. The scissors that need scissors</h3>
      <p>How do you get to your scissors without scissors? Now that is a dilemma!</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/katiehaygarth/status/1037764540086280194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>13. Sliced and separated</h3>
      <p>We have all heard of sliced bread but did you know the slices can be further individually wrapped? Unfortunately, they can.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SEPTEMBER/sizes/sliced_bread_resize_md.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h3>14. The lonely garlic bulb</h3>
      <p>Maybe it is a purse carry-on? You know, for in case you run into a vampire while you are out and about. </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/source_garden/status/1038403223953068032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>15. The Double Trouble</h3>
      <p>What do you pack packaging in? Well in more packaging of course.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SEPTEMBER/sizes/double_trouble_resize_md.png"/>
        <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/7vqa3d/amazon_used_protective_packaging_to_ship_my/?st=jldls4be&amp;sh=9b6af965"><i>davedawg2000/Reddit</i></a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>16. The peel replacement</h3>
      <p>The poster said it best.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/awlilnatty/status/705375555030556672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <h3>17. The solo orange packaging</h3>
      <p>Well, at least this time they kept the peels!</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/pointlesspack/status/983401166749904896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>We had some fun pointing out these mostly environmentally faulty packaging alternatives but in the end, we know how hard innovation can be. As such, we give kudos to these manufacturers for doing their best at coming up with new ideas. May we suggest thinking more sustainably in the future?</p>
