      <p>“The new shirt will also feature our vibrant new crest design, made from a mixture of woven and silicone material, allowing the City crest to really pop. A stitched white Adidas badge and traditional three stripes on the shoulder area complete the look.”</p>
      <p>The new shirt is now available for pre-orders via <a href="https://corkcityfc.ie/shop/kits/home/">the club’s official website</a>.</p>
