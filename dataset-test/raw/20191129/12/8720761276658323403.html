      <p>Paul Sawers, writing for VentureBeat:<i> WhatsApp launched out of beta 10 years ago this month, and the messaging behemoth is now a completely different beast from the one that quietly arrived for iPhone users way back in November 2009. After Facebook shelled out around $20 billion to acquire the app in 2014, WhatsApp introduced voice calls, video calls, group calls, web and desktop apps, end-to-end encryption, and fingperprint unlocking. All the while, Facebook has been figuring out how to monetize its gargantuan acquisition by targeting businesses. However, there remains one glaring chink in WhatsApp's otherwise expansive armor -- <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/29/10-years-in-whatsapp-still-needs-true-multi-device-support/">namely, the lack of simultaneous multi-device support</a>. Things could be about to change, however.<br/><br/>Given that WhatsApp is tethered to a user's mobile number and all messages are stored locally on devices, rather than on remote servers, syncing and accessing WhatsApp across devices poses something of a challenge. WhatsApp Web allows users to message from their desktop computer, but by essentially mirroring their mobile device -- one can't work without the other. Moreover, WhatsApp Web lacks many of the features of the mobile app, such as voice and video calling. Achieving true multi-device support -- without compromising security -- would be a big game changer for WhatsApp.</i></p>
