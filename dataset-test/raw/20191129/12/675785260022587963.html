      <h1>Patrick Vieira makes decision on future amid Arsenal link following Unai Emery's sacking</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery has been sacked as Arsenal manager with Freddie Ljungberg named as interim head coach. Patrick Vieira and Nuno Espirito Santo have been linked with the job</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:06:01+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Patrick Vieira has ruled out leaving Nice in the foreseeable future - despite being linked with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> job.</p>
      <p>Gunners legend Vieira is currently in his second season as Nice manager after finishing seventh in his debut year, having previously taken charge of New York City in the MLS.</p>
      <p>Nice are currently 15th in Ligue 1 after a disappointing start to the campaign - which saw the south coast of France outfit lose all four of their fixtures in October.</p>
      <p>Vieira has been linked with Inter Miami, Lyon and Brazilian club Botafogo in recent times, and he would be an incredibly popular candidate to replace the ditched Unai Emery in the Gunners dugout.</p>

      <p>But Vieira said: "At the beginning of the season it was Lyon, today there is Inter Miami and tomorrow it will be Botafogo.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what to say to you. I do my job every day as best as I can.</p>
      <p>"After that, you have to ask certain people what happens, but I do not feel in any danger. But, in football, we know that things move very fast."</p>

      <p>Vieira's former Invincibles teammate Freddie Ljungberg has been named as Arsenal's interim head coach as the club begin the search for a new gaffer.</p>
      <p>And Ray Parlour reckons ex-captain Vieira would be his choice to take over.</p>
      <p>Parlour told talkSPORT before Emery was sacked: “They’ll have to go with Freddie Ljungberg for the moment, but I’m sure behind the scenes they’ll be sounding a few people out.</p>
      <p>“The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> manager [Nuno Espirito Santo] has been mentioned as has Pochettino, but I’ve always said Patrick Viera.</p>
      <p>“Of course it’s a gamble, it’s a massive gamble, but every manager is a gamble. How did Pep Guardiola start his career, how did Jurgen Klopp? You need that lucky break sometimes.</p>
      <p>“I know for a fact it would be like Frank Lampard at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> – players respect Patrick, he’s been at the club and fans would give him a chance.</p>
