      <p>LAKELAND, Fla. — Authorities say a Florida man is dead after calling 911 to report an armed man outside his home and then pointing a gun at the responding deputy.</p>
      <p>Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said during a news conference that 60-year-old Kenneth Layton’s Friday morning death was the result of a “suicide by cop” situation.</p>
      <p>Judd says Layton made an emergency call, claiming a man with a gun was banging on the door of his Lakeland home. When Deputy Chad Nichols arrived at the home, he reported seeing Layton holding a handgun. When Layton pointed the gun at Nichols, Judd says the deputy fired once, hitting Layton in the chest.</p>
      <p>Officials say Layton died at the scene.</p>
      <p>Judd says Layton’s wife died earlier this year, and they’re investigating whether that contributed to his actions Friday.</p>
