        <b>Music / Fuzzy Sun</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trading in gorgeously melodic, West Coast-tinged synthpop, Stockport quintet Fuzzy Sun scooped CityLife’s prestigious Best Breakthrough Act award earlier this year. Make sure you catch them now before they get way too popular and start headlining massive arenas.</p>

      <p>Norwegian synthpop singer Sigrid has enjoyed a meteoric start to her career: she won the BBC’s Sound of 2018, scored a Top 5 debut album, and performed at Glastonbury and the Nobel Peace Prize concert. Last seen here supporting George Ezra at Manchester Arena in March, she returns this weekend for two big headline shows at the Academy.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Theatre / How To Be Amazingly Happy!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Responding to society’s perception of older, childless women, Yorkshire theatre maker Victoria Firth has crafted this witty, thought-provoking show combining physical comedy and autobiographical storytelling. First performed to rave reviews at last year’s Edinburgh Fringe, the show now arrives at Sale Waterside on its first UK tour.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Preview – Music / BC Camplight</b>
      </p>
      <p>He may have been born and raised in New Jersey, USA, but musician BC Camplight (real name: Brian Christinzio) is a man whose heart firmly belongs to Manchester.</p>
      <p>For those who haven’t followed his back-story, Christinzio endured a torrid few years when he fell foul of UK immigration laws and was booted out of the country (and Manchester) back in 2015. Having made Manchester his home, even describing it as “the city which saved him” when he first moved here in 2012 (he’d been battling substance addiction and mental health issues back in America), Christinzio was, understandably, crushed by his deportation.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, due to his Italian grandparents, Christinzio, after a long-running battle with the UK Home Office, was able to secure European citizenship – and he’s been back in Manchester making glorious music ever since.</p>
      <p>The turbulence of the past few years – and the subsequent toll on his mental well-being – is laid bare on Christinzio’s most recent LP, Deportation Blues, a stirring, cathartic collection of songs whose sonic grandeur brings to mind Phil Spector and Bruce Springsteen.</p>
      <p>Taking a break from working on his next album, Christinzio and his band will be ending the year with two special shows at YES this weekend – go along and give him the raucous home-town reception he deserves.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Bonkers, unpredictable and fabulously entertaining, the monthly FLIM Nite sees a host of theatre-makers/comedians/musicians ‘re-imagining’ a classic film for our amusement.

        <b>Theatre / Hung Theatre Double Bill</b>
      </p>
      <p>Passionate supporters of fresh, original writing, Manchester newcomers Hung Theatre return with a double bill of premières at Salford’s King’s Arms. Lewis Woodward’s Sirens is a scathing satire about society’s social media dependency, while Eleanor Cartmill’s Rotting tells the story of two girls working in a seedy Blackpool pub.</p>
      <p>

        <b>Music / Giggs</b>
      </p>
      <p>UK grime owes a huge debt to Peckham rapper Nathaniel Thompson, aka Giggs. From having his concerts shut down by the Met Police early on in his career, to now, enjoying Top 3-charting mainstream success, Giggs has clearly played a massive part in bringing grime music to a wider audience.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Nominated for five Olivier awards, Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss’ hit musical retells the story of Henry VIII’s six wives with sassy contemporary pop songs.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Theatre / Peter Pan Goes Wrong</b>
      </p>
      <p>London’s Mischief Theatre earned rave reviews and an Olivier award for their farcical meta-comedy The Play That Goes Wrong in 2014. Their follow-up show, Peter Pan Goes Wrong – arriving at Salford Quays next week – promises plenty more mirth and mayhem, but this time with a festive panto-inspired twist.</p>
      <p>

      <p>With songs tackling toxic masculinity, bereavement, immigration, the class system and the NHS, there’s arguably no better British band addressing society’s failings right now than Bristol punk-rockers Idles.

        <b>Preview – Theatre / The Manchester Project at Christmas</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve been seeking a Christmas theatre show which doesn’t involve sugary fairy-tales or “he’s behind you” chants, then make sure you get down to HOME next week – as the excellent Manchester Project makes a welcome return to the city.</p>
      <p>Conceived by local company Monkeywood Theatre, The Manchester Project first debuted at 2018’s Push Festival to rave reviews. Consisting of 19 “micro plays”, all from Mancunian writers, the project set out to – as the title suggests – capture the spirit of Manchester and its people with short, snappy pieces of drama.</p>
      <p>Now, with the festive season in full swing, the Monkeywood team are donning their Santa hats and returning with a special Christmas-themed edition of the Manchester Project. Taking place inside a specially built pop-up theatre in HOME’s gallery space, this glorious celebration of Manchester – and Christmas – will comprise 12 plays from writers and performers including Sarah McDonald Hughes, Cynthia Emeagi, Ian Kershaw, Reuben Johnson, Chris Thorpe, Keisha Thompson, Curtis Cole, Samantha Siddall and more.</p>
