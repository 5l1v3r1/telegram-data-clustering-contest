      <p><b>Mumbai</b>: Congress leader Milind Deora on Friday said Baramati Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule was the "rightful heir" to her father and NCP chief Sharad Pawar's ‘great’ legacy.</p>
      <p>The former Union minister said he shared Sule's belief that social work and policy change are the paths to political empowerment.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"@supriya_sule is the rightful heir to her father's great legacy. She is effective because she believes that social work &amp; policy change are the paths to political empowerment. I share these values &amp; admire her for staying the course," Deora tweeted.</p>
      <p>The former Mumbai South MP made the comment while replying to a tweet.</p>
      <p>Sule is a three-time MP from Baramati in Pune district, the bastion of the Pawars.</p>
      <p>Media reports in the past have claimed there being a race between Sule and her cousin, former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, over inheriting the 79-year-old NCP patriarch's legacy.</p>
      <p>Pawar, whose career spans over 52 years, has been a four-time chief minister of Maharashtra and also served as a minister in the Union cabinet where he handled key portfolios like defence and agriculture.</p>
      <p>He co-founded the NCP after quitting the Congress in 1999.</p>
      <p>The NCP, which spent last five years in the opposition, is a key constituent of the three-pary alliance, Maha Vikas Aghadi, which formed government in Maharashtra on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena and the Congress are the other main partners in the governing coalition.</p>
