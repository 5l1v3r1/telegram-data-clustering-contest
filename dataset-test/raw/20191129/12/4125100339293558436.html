      <p>Abubakar, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, lost his re-election bid after he was defeated by Mohammed, who represented the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the election.</p>
      <p>The appellate court dismissed the appeal filed by the former governor and his party for lack of merit.</p>

      <p>The state election petitions tribunal had also validated Mohammed’s victory over the petitioners’ inability to prove their allegation of ballot stuffing and other election irregularities against the respondents.</p>
      <p>The petitioners had approached the court to overturn the outcome of the election and declare him the duly elected governor of the state or nullify the entire process and order a fresh election into the office of Bauchi State governor.</p>
