      <h1>Stuffed? Woman Needs Her Ass Amputated After “Enhancing” It With Illegal Injections</h1>
      <h2>Doctors told her that in order to fix her ass, it may have to be amputated</h2>

        <b>Model Courtney Barnes may have a little less room this Thanksgiving to stuff her turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s because she has been told by doctors she may need to have her entire ass amputated, after “enhancing” it with illegal injections, according to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/27/model-may-need-60-inch-butt-amputated-after-illegal-injections/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">NY Post</a>.</p>
      <p>Barnes, who is known as Miss Miami, said on the E! show “Botched” that she is desperate to get her body back after the injections. <b>But Doctors told her that in order to fix her ass, it may have to be amputated. </b></p>
      <p><b>“Amputate the whole booty? I’m not doing that.</b> No, I’m not doing that. I’m not amputating butts,” she responded.</p>
      <p>She had the illegal fillers injected when she was 22 years old and working as a dancer in a club.</p>
      <p>She said: “When I was in college I got a job dancing at a club. The first night, after really not making no money on the stage, there was a dancer who walked up to me and she told me that I needed some more booty if I wanted to make some more money. <b>That’s when I found out about the injections that gave me my big booty problems.”</b></p>

      <p>She continued: “So I made the appointment and she showed up at my hotel room. She told me she worked for a cosmetic surgeon and that’s how she was able to get her hands on what she needed. I asked her why she was doing it outside of the office and that’s when she told me the procedure was illegal. <b>It’s foolish, definitely,  but all I wanted was a big booty.”</b></p>

      <p>She underwent three rounds of injections over a year, but that wasn’t enough. And it was during the fourth round that problems began, she said.</p>
      <p>Barnes said: “This time I showed up at her house to have my injections, but after leaving my injections were beginning to leak out of my butt. My butt had so many dimples so I called the lady who injected me immediately. She told me it probably could be fixed with a few more shots and that’s how round number five got started.”</p>
      <p>She continued: “That round of injections, it seemed like it only made my butt bigger. She did not fill in the holes. Then number six happened. It made it a bit worse. There was nothing I could do to fix my butt. <b>After six rounds of butt injections, I believe I spent about seven or eight thousand dollars to get me right here, with these big booty problems.”</b></p>

      <p>Barnes has embraced the ass implants, posting photos to her nearly 1 million Instagram followers and writing an Autobiography called “I Am Not My Body — But I Wanted a Bigger Behind,” which warns young women about the dangers of getting implants.</p>

        <b>Dr. Terry Dubrow examined Barnes but says he can’t find where her old ass begins and her new one starts. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Dubrow commented on the show: “Whoa, I’ve never felt anything like this before. Because the masses are so superficially located, you absolutely can’t remove all of them. Unless you amputate … the whole booty.”</p>
      <p>And what would this feel good story be without a silver lining? Dubrow concluded: <b>“The good news is that the person didn’t seem to inject much of it into the muscle — and that’s how people die.</b> You get into the blood vessel of the buttock muscle and it goes right into the main blood vessel that goes back to your heart and your lungs. <b>That’s how they’re killing people, so it’s very good that you don’t have that problem.”</b></p>
