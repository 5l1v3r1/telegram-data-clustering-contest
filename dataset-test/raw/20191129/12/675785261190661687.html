      <h2>Unai Emery has been sacked as Arsenal manager after 18 months in charge following a run of seven matches without a win - which saw 15 goals conceded and five leads slip</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:40:23+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville has criticised Arsenal's players and the club's recruitment programmes after Unai Emery was sacked as the Gunners' manager.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Emery was relieved of his job at the Emirates on Friday morning after overseeing a run of seven matches without a win - culminating in a 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>But instead of blaming Emery for Arsenal's failure, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend Neville thinks poor transfers and an "uncoachable" squad is the key reasons for the former Paris Saint-Germain boss's downfall.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> signed David Luiz and Kieran Tierney to shore up their defence in the summer, alongside a record outlay on winger Nicolas Pepe.</p>

      <p>While during their seven game winless run, the side have conceded 15 goals and seen five leads slip.</p>
      <p>"Let's be clear about this, these defenders are uncoachable," Neville said on Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p>"I don't know who has been responsible for recruitment at Arsenal over the last two or three years but if I was in the boardroom I would be giving that lot a right rocket after watching some of the shambles.</p>

      <p>"There is no way Unai Emery is telling David Luiz to step up two or three times to play offside or some of the hideous things you see from other defenders and midfield players.</p>
      <p>"You think of Xhaka the other week. Emery is a man of honour and you see his behaviour. This is something far deeper than the coach.</p>
      <p>"He is potentially sailing over the shores of the Channel this afternoon and is very happy to leave behind what is quite simply a very average bunch of players.</p>
      <p>"The coach will ultimately take the fall but some of the things we were seeing on the pitch was fantasy football.</p>
      <p>"Without a shadow of a doubt they have let him down. The recruitment has been truly pathetic. You couldn't find a more erratic bunch of players in terms of defending to watch.</p>
      <p>"If you were to say 'go out and find the three or four most erratic defenders in Europe' it seems like that has been the brief.Â </p>
      <p>"Some of the players aren't up to it, they aren't of the quality for Arsenal's level."</p>
