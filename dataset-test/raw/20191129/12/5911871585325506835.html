      <p><i>Miss Anthropocene</i>, Grimes’ long-awaited follow-up to <i>Art Angels</i>, is finally arriving in February. We’ve already heard early tracks “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057166/grimes-violence-feat-i_o-video/video/">Violence</a>” and “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2064873/grimes-so-heavy-i-fell-through-the-earth/music/">So Heavy I Fell Through The Earth</a>” — along with last year’s “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2024011/grimes-we-appreciate-power-feat-hana/music/">We Appreciate Power</a>,” which was initially billed as the first single but won’t actually end up included on the album. And now, following yet another week where Grimes has been in the news for <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2065918/grimes-zola-jesus-devon-welsh-silicon-fascist/news/">reasons other than making music</a>, she’s shared another new song.</p>
      <p>That song is “My Name Is Dark,” a dark and gritty electro-rocker that may or may not be the “very not pg13 ethereal shadow of colossus demon nu metal song abt insomnia” that Grimes <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1996055/grimes-shares-new-song-descriptions-and-working-tracklist-for-new-album/news/">first teased on Twitter over a year ago</a>. “I don’t need to sleep anymore/ That’s what the drugs are for,” she sings on the track over a menacing guitar riff and gathering clouds of noise.
