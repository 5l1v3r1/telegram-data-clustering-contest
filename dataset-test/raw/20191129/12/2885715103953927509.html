      <h2>Wasim Akram slammed Shaheen Afridi for a misfield vs Australia. "Yasir Shah and Shan Masood were probably yawning. That's the problem with Pakistan cricket," he said.</h2>

      <p>A misfield by Pakistan’s Shaheen Afridi on Day 1 of the Adelaide Test summed up the day for the visiting team on Friday. Afridi, who was ironically the only bowler to get a wicket on the day, as Australia pulverized Pakistan into submission by putting on 302/1 by Stumps, was trolled on social media for what looked like kicking the ball into the boundary for a four.</p>

      <p>Afridi turned what should have been a regulation retrieval of the ball into a boundary.</p>
      <p>Some fans have suggested that Afridi could have had a problem in seeing the pink ball.</p>

      <p>Some others have just suggested this is another example of Pakistan’s continuing fielding woes.</p>

      <p>“Shaheen Shah was in la la land at fine leg,” Wasim Akram, who is on commentary duty for the series, said.</p>
      <p>“Yasir Shah and Shan Masood were probably yawning. That’s the problem with Pakistan cricket. They should be on the ball.</p>
      <p>“Nobody was backing up and you as a fielder, it doesn’t matter how inexperienced you are, you set yourself, new batsman in, they just came out, I’ll probably start five-ten yards inside the boundary line not on the boundary,” Akram added.</p>
