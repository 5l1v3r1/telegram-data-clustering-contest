      <p>Earlier this week, a man headed down the Thames with his Staffordshire bull terrier, with the pair on a mission to spread festive cheer.</p>
      <p>Phil Bradshaw and his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/%3Ca%20href=">dog</a>, Lucky, are taking part in The Christmas Cruise for StreetVet, an animal welfare charity, with the aim to collect donations for homeless people during <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christmas/">Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>The journey started from Hemel Hempstead on 26 November and will continue until 10 December, with the final destination at the Imperial Wharf Marina in central London.</p>
      <p>Along the way, Phil and Lucky will make 11 stops – with today’s location (29 November) announced as Springwell Lock visitor moorings, Stocker’s Lake.</p>
      <p>People are encouraged to hand over dog toys and food vouchers, which will then be distributed by StreetVet to homeless people across the city.</p>
      <p>Suggested voucher outlets include Caffé Nero, Greggs, Pets at Home, Starbucks or Sainsbury’s, but other options are welcome, too.</p>

      <p>Phil and Lucky have first-hand experience of having ‘no fixed abode’.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the pair were staying at a hostel when Phil found a lump on Lucky’s mammary gland. As he had no funds to pay for surgery for his beloved pet, he contacted StreetVet to help.</p>
      <p>‘I was so grateful for the incredible support we received from StreetVet,’ he said.</p>
      <p>’13-year-old Lucky has been my best friend and loyal companion since she was six weeks old, so the relief was overwhelming.’</p>
      <p>Since then, Phil has joined the organisation as an ambassador, taking part in various events including The Long Walk in 2018, a fundraising trip around the UK where he pushed a buggy from Cornwall to Scotland, and back to the east coast of Britain.</p>
      <p>They did 10 to 20 miles per day, and raised £5,000 for the charity.</p>
      <p>For the cruise, Phil and Lucky are using their new home – a 40-year-old vessel named ‘Baloo’, which was given to them by an anonymous donor who met them during The Long Walk.</p>
      <p>‘I’m brimming over with the reception we’re getting along our journey,’ he tells Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>It’s been hard work at times, tackling up to eight locks in a day in the driving rain, but it’s been absolutely worth it.</p>
      <p>‘People of all ages, even little children, have been coming up and giving us dog toys, dog coats and vouchers for food and drink too, for the homeless.</p>
      <p>‘Pubs and cafés along the way have been putting up posters encouraging people to get involved and doing whip-rounds.</p>

      <p>‘And dog walkers are always super-keen to hear about what we’re up to!’</p>
      <p>‘I’m so proud to be doing this with Lucky. StreetVet means so much to us. They’re all about mending broken hearts, changing lives and being real.’</p>
