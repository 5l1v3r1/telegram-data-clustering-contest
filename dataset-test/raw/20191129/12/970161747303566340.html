      <p>The Prime Minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, has been accused of snobbery and ‘contempt for the rest of the population’ after calling most of the public ‘illiterate’.</p>
      <p>He made the comments today while appearing on the Victoria Derbyshire show, as he sought to defend his son Boris.</p>
      <p>The prime minister has been accused of ‘lying’ and running scared after his refusal to attend debates and an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Neil.</p>
      <p>Asked about Boris being called Pinocchio, Mr Johnson replies: ‘That requires a degree of literacy, which I think the great British public doesn’t necessarily have.’</p>
      <p>When told that his remarks were quite ‘pejorative’, Mr Johnson replies: ‘They couldn’t spell Pinocchio if they tried’.</p>
      <p>Pushed on why he would say such a thing, he asks ‘can you spell Pinocchio?’</p>

      <p>He goes on to express his shock and disbelief that the programme can read out a live Tweet from a viewer which calls the prime minister ‘a liar’.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson says: ‘I think it is utterly absurd and wrong that you can read out on air, a Tweet coming in from one of your readers, on air, which calls the prime minister a liar.</p>
      <p>‘I think it’s amazing you can do that’.</p>
