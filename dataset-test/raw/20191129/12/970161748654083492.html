      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here viewers were left fuming on Thursday night after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> suggested Father Christmas wasn’t real (how dare they?).</p>
      <p>During the show, the celebrities were discussing their favourite festive traditions while they were chilling at the camp, and fans believed the pair had implied that the big man in red wasn’t real.</p>
      <p>The England rugby player told the campers that his parents used to spoil him at Christmas, leaving footprints on the carpet.</p>
      <p>I was so lucky as my parents spoilt me rotten, Christmas was the most magical time and my favourite time of the year,’ he began.</p>
      <p>‘I had footprints on the carpet and bite marks in everything.’</p>
      <p>Ian then questioned: ‘Half a mince pie bitten?’</p>
      <p>James replied: ‘Yeh yeh, carrots with tooth marks in it.’</p>

      <p>The former footballer then went even further by explaining that he used to dress up as Father Christmas for his kids.</p>

      <p>‘When the girls were really young I done Father Christmas,’ he explained.</p>
      <p>‘Lola was like this (he pulls a suspicious face by squinting his eyes) ‘let me see your teeth’.</p>
      <p>Viewers quickly took to social media to share their rage about what the pair had implied.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘@ITV fancy airing a section on #ImACeleb where camp mates talk about Father Christmas in THAT way, shame on you, awkward Qs being asked now, have a bit more social awareness!!!!’</p>
      <p>Another commented: ‘Please can you confirm if you will remove the Father Christmas reference from tomorrow’s #ImACeleb episode at 6pm…it’s just that my young children love watching it! Thank you.’</p>
      <p>One added: ‘Thanks for destroying Christmas for a lot of kids watching this tonight or later on catch up..#fatherchristmas #ImACeleb’</p>
