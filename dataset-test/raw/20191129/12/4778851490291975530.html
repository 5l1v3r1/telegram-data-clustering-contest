        <b>Feyenoord boss Dick Advocaat claimed he barely noticed Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos last night - apart from netting the brace that earned the Light Blues a point in Rotterdam.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dutch side took a half-time lead at De Kuip thanks to Jens Toornstra's deflected strike and had to rely on Luis Sinisterra to avoid defeat after compatriot Morelos had scored a quickfire brace to put the Gers in front.</p>
      <p>Feyenoord can still reach the knockout stages but former Ibrox boss Advocaat needs his team to overcome Porto in Portugal - and hope his old side do them a favour against Swiss outfit Young Boys.</p>
      <p>“We knew Stevie [Gerrard] would say something to them at half-time but they had more possession without clear chances,” Advocaat said after the match.</p>
      <p>“Their striker [Morelos] is a great striker because he scored two goals, but for the rest of the time I didn’t see him.</p>
      <p>“He is still a good striker. That makes the difference.”</p>
