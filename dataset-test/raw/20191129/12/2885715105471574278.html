      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:18:02+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Zurich Airport International AG was on Friday selected as the concessionaire for developing the Jewar airport, billed to be the biggest airport in India upon completion, officials said.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland-headquartered company made the highest per-passenger bid for the airport, outbidding competitors like Delhi International Airport Limited, Adani Enterprises, and Anchorage Infrastructure Investments Holdings Limited, the officials said.</p>
      <p>Jewar Airport or the Noida International Greenfield Airport will come up in the 5,000-hectare area when fully constructed and is estimated to cost Rs 29,560 crores, Nodal Officer for the Project, Shailendra Bhatia said.</p>
      <p>“Zurich Airport International AG has made the highest bid for developing the Jewar airport and has been selected as the concessionaire for the airport,” Bhatia said.</p>
      <p>A global tender was floated to hire a developer for the proposed airport on May 30 by the NIAL, an agency floated by the Uttar Pradesh government for managing the mega project in Gautam Buddh Nagar district.</p>
      <p>The airport, the third in the national capital region after Delhi’s <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/indira-gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> International airport and Ghaziabad’s Hindon airport, is touted to have six to eight runways, the most in India, when fully built, according to officials.</p>
      <p>The first phase of the airport would be spread over 1,334 hectares and cost Rs 4,588 crore as it is expected to be completed by 2023, the officials said.</p>
