      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/maddie-ziegler/"><b>Maddie Ziegler</b></a> just recently opened up about her new role in the remake of <b><i>West Side Story</i></b>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/steven-spielberg/"><b>Steven Spielberg</b></a> film stars <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/rachel-zegler/"><b>Rachel Zegler</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/ansel-elgort/"><b>Ansel Elgort</b></a> in the roles of Maria and Tony in the modern-day re-telling of <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i>.</p>
      <p>“I’m one of the Jet girls,” <b>Maddie </b>explained to Entertainment Tonight, adding that “it was honestly one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. To work with Steven Spielberg was a pretty life-changing thing, so I’m really grateful for that.”</p>
      <p>As for the movie itself, <b>Maddie </b>assures big fans of the film that nothing big has changed.</p>
      <p>“We stayed really true to the value of the first movie . . . so the costumes, the hair, and the makeup [are] all very from that era, which is amazing. I think we just added more flair from this new cast,” she adds. “I learned so much from all the dancers and the actors. Everyone is brilliant.”</p>
      <p>We can’t wait to see the movie! <i>West Side Story</i> is expected to premiere in December of 2020.</p>
