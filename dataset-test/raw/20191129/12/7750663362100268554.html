      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> will be looking to return to winning ways when they welcome Aston Villa to Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.</h2>

      <p>The Red Devils came from two goals behind to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/result/result-sheffield-united-salvage-late-draw-after-man-utd-comeback_380495.html">draw 3-3</a> with Sheffield United in the league last weekend before <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/europa-league/result/result-manchester-united-youngsters-slump-to-defeat-in-kazakhstan_380939.html">losing 2-1</a> away to Astana in the Europa League on Thursday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a>'s side have shown improvement in recent weeks, though, and could go as high as fifth in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League table</a> this weekend with a victory, although that scenario would rely on other teams around them dropping points.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> rounds up United's latest injury and suspension news ahead of the clash.</p>
