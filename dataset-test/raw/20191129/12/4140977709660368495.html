          <p>In the second last round of the first day of the <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/pmco-global-finals-standings-and-points-table-pmco-2019-day-1-results-live-team-soul-finishes-15th-and-entity-came-on-9th/">PMCO Fall split global finals</a>, Indian team Soul has won in a splendid fashion. The round was set to be played in the frozen Vikendi map, which is comparatively smaller than other maps, hence, it is more intense and needs better improvisation.</p>
          <p>Team Soul got an initial advantage of the central location of the zone in the map. With the game advancing, the zone actually zeroes down to them. The Indian team was well guarded by the fortress they camped in while all the teams were weakened while travelling into the blue zone.</p>

                <p>Amidst all this, credits should go to the Clutchgod who risked to involve himself in a rush and killed two opposite players in the process, making his team’s win possible.</p>

                          <p>On the other side, the Entity gaming had an underwhelming performance in the third round as they were first to be eliminated. But, at the same time, they have been impressive on the first day and came second in the second round played in Miramar.</p>

                            <p>This win by Team Soul brought them at the 8th position. From now, Team Soul has to be consistent, although in the next round they were eliminated at 12th, which will certainly bring them down in the order.</p>
