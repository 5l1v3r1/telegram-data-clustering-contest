      <h1>Birsa Dasgupta: I Am Happy To Have Directed So Many New Actors, Says Mafia Director</h1>

        <b>Mafia is the first web series directed by Birsa Dasgupta. It is produced by Roadshow Films, Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Aritra Sen’s production house. Mafia will stream on Zee5 early next year</b>
      </p>
      <p>Birsa Dasgupta has directed ten feature films. He has worked with many known faces of Tollywood. However, this year he took a conscious decision to explore the OTT space and to work with new actors. That is the young director’s biggest takeaway from Mafia, his debut web series. “So far I had only worked with the Bengali film fraternity. That’s why I’m happy to have directed so many new faces like Namit Das, who have not been seen on Bengali screens yet,” says Birsa Dasgupta. Currently busy with the editing of Mafia, he is also excited about his first web venture. “I have been sending the edits to Zee5 and the producers. They really like it,” Birsa says. The series has 8 episodes, each of 40-odd minutes. It is written by Rohan Ghose.</p>
      <p>Mafia is based on the game of the same name. “The series starts with six friends playing Mafia in a remote bungalow in a forest. They play the game and something goes wrong. The game brings out the dark side of the friends,” explains Birsa. Six years later, the friends reunite and go back to the same bungalow. “Two of them are now married, so there are eight people. You have to wait and see what happens next. All I can say is, its all about mind games. The way we have shot the series, there’s a sense of impending doom,” says Birsa.</p>

      <p>Birsa Dasgupta’s web adventure will not stop with Mafia. His next web series, titled Kala Khoon, is just as intriguing. “It is Macbeth meets Hamlet, in the coal belt of West Bengal and Jharkhand. We will go on the floor in January,” signs off Birsa. SpotboyE wishes him all the very best for his web future!</p>
