      <h1>Grab a Free Nintendo Switch When You Buy Any Huawei P30 with Virgin Media</h1>

      <p>Do you like Huawei, need a new phone, and could do with a free games console to sweeten the deal? Well do we have the Black Friday deal for you, because Virgin Media has not only knocked money off the P30 Pro, it's also bundled with a Nintendo Switch. While stocks last anyway.</p>
      <p>This deal applies to the <a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/mobile/pay-monthly/huawei/p30-nintendo-switch?contractDuration=36&amp;tariffID=1209711626">Huawei P30</a>,<a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/mobile/pay-monthly/huawei/p30-pro-nintendo-switch?contractDuration=36&amp;tariffID=1209711626"> P30 Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/mobile/pay-monthly/huawei/p30-lite-nintendo-switch?contractDuration=36&amp;tariffID=1209711626">P30 Lite</a>, all of which have had £108 knocked off their total for the Black Friday period. Huawei generally makes quite good phones (even if EMUI is nowhere near the best software an Android phone could have), and a free Switch is just an extra bonus to go with it.</p>
      <p>Prices start at £20 a month for the P30 Lite, £27 a month for the P30, and £32 a month for the P30 Pro, and there are no upfront costs to catch you out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/mobile/pay-monthly?brands=huawei">You can check out all the deals here,</a> and just be aware that the above prices are for 36 month contracts. 24 month ones are going to cost more.</p>
