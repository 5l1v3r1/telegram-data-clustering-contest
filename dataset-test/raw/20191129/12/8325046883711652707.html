      <p>Cross-border payments between Singapore and Malaysia just got a huge boost, after the Republic’s NETS and Malaysia’s PayNet announced that their payment terminals can now accept each other’s cards.</p>
      <p>This comes a year after NETS ATM card payments were first enabled overseas, in Johor Bahru.</p>
      <p>With the announcement, NETS ATM cards can now be used in Malaysia across 7,400 PayNet acceptance points in Johor Bahru, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca – all popular cities for Singaporean tourists.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Malaysia’s MyDebit ATM cards can also be used to make payments at 500 acceptance points in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Currently, MyDebit cards are accepted through the NETS network of merchants at Bugis Village, and selected iStudio, Pandora, SaladStop! and Awfully Chocolate outlets.</p>
      <p>According to PayNet Group CEO Peter Schiesser, transactions will be based on “competitive” exchange rates, and the payment providers will not charge any foreign exchange fees.</p>
      <p>“To be able to freely use MyDebit ATMs not only provides the convenience to (Malaysian tourists in Singapore) but also benefits businesses in Singapore which translates into higher cashless cross-border transactions,” PayNet Group CEO Peter Schiesser said.</p>
      <p>The companies said they will also look at enabling cross-border instant fund transfers and QR payments between Singapore and Malaysia in future.</p>
