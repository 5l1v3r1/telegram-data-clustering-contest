      <p>The economic slowdown continues as India's GDP growth slipped to 4.5 per cent during the July-September quarter, a straight decline for seven consecutive quarters now.

      <p>While several sectors grew at 7 per cent or more during Q2 2018/19, overall growth has dipped further this year. Private consumption almost halved and fixed gross capital formation moved to the negative territory.
