      <h3>IN a bid to promote responsible use of water, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), National Water Resources Board (NWRB),  the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and water concessionaires Manila Water Company and Maynilad launched yesterday  “Oplan Tubig Para sa Kinabukasan.”</h3>
      <p>“Oplan Tubig Para sa Kinabukasan” seeks to encourage everyone to be informed of the current water situation,  to be prepared at all times in cases of water shortage and to be involved in a greater cause of using water conscientiously.</p>
      <p>“We all need water to live and we can all do something to ensure that we continuously enjoy this precious resource even in our own little ways,’’ said MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim.</p>
      <p>According to Lim, water is very vital and every drop must not go to waste. He also said that water plays an important role most especially during disaster. “We use water in our everyday use and we use it more when natural disaster hits us. The demand for potable water increases in areas where calamities strike.”</p>
      <p>Victims of calamities often ask for water as the supply is either always lacking or completely cut off.</p>
      <p>“There is clearly a need for us to work together in this campaign especially with our current water situation. We need to reach as many Filipinos as we can and educate them on how we can help from the demand side,” Chairman Lim added.</p>
      <p>Lim also said that the MMDA, as the lead agency, will actively push for the participation of the local governments in Metro Manila.</p>
      <p>Each of the Metro Manila LGUs also have their own advocacy videos to show their constituents their commitment for responsible water usage.</p>
      <p>Based on the last data from NW RB, Angat Dam, which is the primary source of water in Metro Manila, is currently at 188.6 meters – 23.4 meters lower than the expected 212 meters elevation by the end of the year.</p>
