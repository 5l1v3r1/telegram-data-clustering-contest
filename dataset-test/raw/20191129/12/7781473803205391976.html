      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:15:36+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Aditya Jadhav  </a></address>
      <p>Bollywood actor Arshad Warsi recently bought the BMW F 750 GS. The adventure tourer is the recent addition to his fleet that consists of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/ducati/monster-821-m470/">Ducati Monster 821</a> and the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/indian/scout-m384/">Indian Scout</a>.</p>
      <p>BMW Motorrad motorcycles seems to be the choice of most Bollywood celebrities considering that <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/shahid-kapoor-bought-a-bmw-r1250-gs-adventure/">earlier this year Shahid Kapoor bought a BMW R 1250 GS</a>. Followed by Shah Rukh Khan who was seen astride the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/bmw/g-310-r-m545/">BMW G 310 R</a>, giving safety tips and encouraging safe riding.</p>

      <p>The F 750 GS gets an option of a 6.5-inch full-colour TFT display for instrumentation. Integrating operations via the BMW Motorrad multi-controller, it gives the rider quick access to the motorcycle and connectivity functions. Phone and media functions can be used without having to install an app. The rider can easily make telephone calls and enjoy listening to music with Bluetooth connection. In addition, the BMW Motorrad Connected app offers everyday-suitable and practice-oriented arrow navigation directly via the TFT display. The motorcycles feature ABS, stability control and Rain/Road riding modes as standard.</p>
