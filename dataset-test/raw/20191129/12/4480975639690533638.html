      <h1>ECB Board nominee Schnabel: September stimulus can be justified by current inflation data</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:22:44+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>The European Central Bank's (ECB) September stimulus could be justified by current inflation data as well as the outlook for inflation over the medium-term, argued Isabel Schnabel, Germany’s nominee to the board of the ECB.</p>
      <p>"Over the past 20 years, the ECB has been very successful in achieving its primary objective of price stability," Schnabel said. "The current situation is characterized by a global downturn, related to rising uncertainty in response to the trade conflict and the looming <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a>."</p>
      <p>The EUR/USD pair, which slumped to a daily low of 1.0993 in the last hour, was last seen trading at 1.1000, down 0.07% on the day.</p>
      <p>"The experience with low and even negative interest rates in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a> area appears to have been positive," Schnabel further added. </p>
