      <p>Vivo V17 with a punch-hole display and diamond-shaped rear camera module could launch in India on December 9. Vivo has sent out invites for an event on this date for the launch of a new V-Series Vivo smartphone, which reveals the outline of a smartphone with a punch-hole camera on the top right of the screen.</p>
      <p>Though the invite does not reveal the name of the phone, it is likely that the V17 could be unveiled since it was recently launched in Russia but it will come to India with a small difference. <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-vivo-v17-launch-in-india-punch-hole-display-design/">According to a <i>91Mobiles</i> report,</a> Vivo is looking to bring V17 with a punch-hole display in India instead of a waterdrop notch design that has been announced for the Russian market.</p>
      <p>The report added that the smartphone could launch at a price of Rs 22,000. Except for the punch-hole design, the rest of the specifications will likely remain the same as the Russia variant, which comes with four back cameras, Snapdragon 665 processor, and 4,500mAh battery.</p>
