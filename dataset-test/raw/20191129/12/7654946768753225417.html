      <p>PARIS — Dozens of French activists blocked an Amazon warehouse south of Paris in a Black Friday-inspired protest, amid increased opposition to the post-Thanksgiving sales phenomenon that has seen a group of French lawmakers push to ban it altogether.</p>
      <p>Protesters from climate group Amis de la terre (Friends of the Earth) spread hay and old refrigerators and microwaves on the driveway leading to the warehouse in Bretigny-sur-Orge on Thursday. They held signs in front of the gates reading “Amazon: For the climate, for jobs, stop expansion, stop over-production!”</p>
      <p>The activists were later dislodged by police.</p>
      <p>More demonstrations are expected as Black Friday looms into view. French climate groups are planning “Block Friday” demonstrations Friday.</p>
      <p>Their objections are garnering some support within France’s National Assembly. Some French lawmakers want to ban Black Friday, which has morphed into a global phenomenon even though it stems from a specific U.S. holiday: Thanksgiving Thursday.</p>
      <p>A French legislative committee passed an amendment Monday that proposes prohibiting Black Friday since it causes “resource waste” and “overconsumption.”</p>
      <p>The amendment, which was put forward by France’s former environment minister, Delphine Batho, will be debated next month. France’s e-commerce union has condemned it.</p>
      <p>On Europe 1 radio Thursday, France’s ecological transition minister, Elisabeth Borne, criticized Black Friday for creating “traffic jams, pollution, and gas emissions.”</p>
      <p>She added that she would support Black Friday if it helped small French businesses, but said it mostly benefits large online retailers.</p>
