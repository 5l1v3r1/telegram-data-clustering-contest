        <b>Freeview viewers in Dunblane could have some of their favourite telly shows interrupted because new 4G mobile masts have been erected in the area.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new 4G mobile service has been switched on in the town but its signal is next to the frequencies used by Freeview, 800 MHz.</p>
      <p>There is a chance that some residents in the area may experience interference to Freeview, which is received via an aerial.</p>
      <p>Signs of interference include a loss of sound, pictures going `blocky’, freezing or the TV screen going blank or showing a ‘No Signal’ message.</p>
      <p>Those who use the Freeview service are now being offered free support to fix the interference.</p>
      <p>A company called at800 – set up under government direction – will offer help to households that rely on Freeview for their TV to resolve 4G-related interference problems.</p>
      <p>Ben Roome, chief executive of at800, said: “We want to ensure that people know it’s our role to fix Freeview interference caused by 4G at 800 MHz, and that there’s no charge for our service.</p>
      <p>“If you rely on Freeview for TV, we can send you a filter to fit yourself, free of charge, which fits into the aerial lead connecting to TVs and set-top boxes to block mobile signals. Full instructions are included, and we can provide further advice online and by phone if needed.</p>
      <p>“In most instances, fitting the filter will resolve any interference from 4G at 800 MHz, but if this isn’t the case, we may also be able to arrange a follow-up visit from an at800 engineer at no cost, depending on eligibility.” Cable and satellite TV won’t be affected.</p>
      <p>at800 also offers extra support for people who are aged 75 or older, are registered blind or partially sighted or receive personal independence payments (PIPs), attendance allowance, constant attendance allowance or War Pensioner’s Mobility Support.</p>
      <p>Anyone experiencing interference can contact at800 by calling 0808 13 13 800.</p>
