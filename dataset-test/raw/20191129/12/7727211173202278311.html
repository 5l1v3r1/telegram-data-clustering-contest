      <p>Ruth Langsford was forced to apologise on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/this-morning">This Morning</a> after a soap star swore on live <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tv">TV.</a></p>
      <p>Lynne McGranger who plays Irene Roberts in Home and Away was talking to Ruth and her husband Eamonn Holmes when she dropped the unexpected naughty word.</p>
      <p>Speaking about what she might be doing if she wasn't an actress, the 66-year-old said she was a teacher, but it didn't work out.</p>
      <p>In fact, she said: "Then the kids came in and it went t*** up."</p>

      <p>Both Ruth and Eamonn laughed before Ruth added: "I don't think we are allowed to say that, I am sorry if anyone was offended."</p>
      <p>Fans at home notice the foul language straight away, one @YTVChase saidL " 7 year old just said to me “What does t*** up mean?” Thanks a lot."</p>
      <p>But most saw the funny side, @Dishie_585 said: " If you are offended for someone saying "T*** up" you need to get a grip!"</p>
      <p>Another, @EatPieKillDemon said: " Someone somewhere will be offended at the fact she said tits."</p>
      <p>A third, @DavidMackayy said: " Some snowflake out there has just had a heart attack due to the fact she’s just said “tits up” and to them I say get a grip"</p>
      <p>Lynne has played Irene for 26 years, making her the longest serving female cast member of the soap.</p>
      <p>She was only supposed to be on the Australian soap for three months, but that quickly turned to a year, then two.</p>

          <b>Why we write trending stories<br/>The Liverpool Echo writes several stories a day on well known personalities or popular TV shows for instance.<br/>They are often on subjects that get people talking on social media about a specific moment they've seen or heard, which is why we call them trending stories.<br/>While we know they are among the most popular stories we produce, they can also receive negative feedback in our comments so we have created this Factbox to respond to some of the most common points raised.<br/><b>This isn't real news / real journalism<br/></b>Trending news is as real as any other subject we cover. Our stories are written by trained and experienced journalists, responding quickly to events.<br/>We understand they are not for everyone and we have lots of stories on other topics for our audience to read.<br/><b>It's nothing to do with Liverpool<br/></b>A lot of stories we do have nothing to do with Liverpool on the face of it. However that does not mean people from Liverpool are not interested in the subject, TV show or person and enjoy reading about them.<br/><b>No-one reads this type of story<br/></b>We use data to help us decide what to write about. Our data shows us how popular trending stories are. What's more, they are very popular among our most loyal audience - people who visit our website more than 15 times a month.<br/>Thanks for reading.
