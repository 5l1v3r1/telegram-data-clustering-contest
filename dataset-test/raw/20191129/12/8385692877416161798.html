      <p>If you've been looking to get a solid projector, but the prices seemed too high… well, look again. The Nebula Prizm II may not be the best projector out there, but it's a steal at its current price tag.</p>
      <p>We'd argue that this is a solid projector at its original price tag of $215, but for $159, it's a steal. This speaker is now <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounted</a> as part of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>This is a lightning deal on Amazon, by the way, and you have a little over 2 hours to claim it at this point. At the time of writing this article, the deal has been 40-percent claimed, so there's not much stock left.</p>

      <p>This is a projector by Anker, and as already mentioned, it's not exactly the best offering on the market. You cannot expect miracles at $159, though.</p>
      <p>This is a really solid projector for your house projections, and a presentation of two, that's for sure. It can project a 120-inch image in fullHD resolution.</p>
      <p>It comes with dual drivers for a cinematic sound, and it even delivers some bass, which is impressive at this price tag.</p>

      <p>This projector has both horizontal and vertical keystone correction in order to ensure a clear, rectangular image, even if you place this projector at an angle.</p>
      <p>All you need to do in order to use this product is plug it in. There's no pesky setup process, or anything of the sort. It can project content from a ton of different devices, including Fire TV stick, Chromecast, Roku, Xbox One, PS4, and so on.</p>
      <p>This projector's bulb has a 30,000-hour lifespan, that pretty much means that it shouldn't break on you anytime soon. You can get years and years worth of usage here.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This projector is available in a single color variant, black. Most people won't have an issue with that. The device is still available, but not for long, so if you're interested it may be wise to act fast.</p>
