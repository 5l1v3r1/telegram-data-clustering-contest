      <p>Make sure you check out our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/apple-deals-christmas-3779517/">complete round up of the best Apple deals we've seen for Christmas 2019.</a></p>
      <h3>How much does an Apple TV cost?</h3>
      <p>Apple last updated the Apple TV more than two years ago in September 2017 when it introduced the Apple TV 4K. Apple sells that model alongside the older Apple TV HD (aka 4th generation), which was introduced in October 2015 (four years ago).</p>
      <p>In the past Apple has sold the Apple TV for as little as £70/$99. But currently the prices are a lot higher than that.</p>
      <p>Here are the prices Apple sells its Apple TV for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple TV HD, 32GB <b>£149</b></li>
        <li>Apple TV 4K, 32GB <b>£179</b></li>
        <li>Apple TV 4K, 64GB <b>£199</b></li>
      </ul>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite both Apple TV media players starting to show their age, Apple’s price seems quite high, at least in comparison with other similar media streamers, such as the Amazon Fire TV, which normally costs £39.99 and can also stream Apple’s new shows. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-Streaming-Media-Player-Alexa/dp/B0791RGQW3?ascsubtag=41-3777164-11-0000000">Get one from Amazon here</a>.</p>
      <p>Alternatively you could get a Roku streaming player and stream Apple TV+ on that. A Roku Express normally costs £29.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Roku-Express-Streaming-Player-Black/dp/B07XGMNK9G?ascsubtag=41-3777164-11-0000000">here</a>.</p>
