        <b>EBAY has slashed the price of the Xbox One S 1TB Digital Edition to just £99 in an extremely impressive deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Black Friday sale also bundles in three games – in what could be the best gaming deal we've seen so far.</p>

      <p>The three games bundled in the deal include the hugely popular Minecraft.</p>
      <p>You also get pirate adventure game Sea of Thieves.</p>
      <p>And the third title is Forza Horizon 3, a stunning and fast-paced racing game.</p>
      <p>The bad news is that this deal is likely to sell out very quickly, given the extremely low price.</p>

      <p>The Xbox One S All-Digital Edition launched earlier this year for £199.99.</p>
      <p>It is slightly cheaper than a normal Xbox, but can't play games from discs you buy in shops.</p>
      <p>Because it doesn't have a disc drive, if you want to play games on it and don't fancy a subscription service, you'll have to either buy them from Microsoft's store, or get digital codes from third-party resellers.</p>
      <p>The console comes with a gargantuan 1 terabyte of storage as well as a wireless controller.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but you'll get Minecraft, Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 3 thrown in to boot.</p>
      <p>They'll come as digital download cards rather than discs, for obvious reasons.</p>

      <h4>Our tips for finding the best deals this Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h4>
      <p>
        <b>IT might be tempting to dive in and snap up LOADS of items on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but here’s how you can guarantee you’re getting a good deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>PREPARE</b> Research the items you want to buy and find out the cheapest price. Websites like PriceSpy, PriceHistory and CamelCamelCamel will give you historical data on prices so you can see how much you should pay.</p>
      <p><b>GET FOLLOWING </b>Follow your favourite shops on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and sign up to its deals newsletter to get the latest on any offers. We post the best deals in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSunMoney/">Sun Money FB group</a> too.</p>
      <p><b>EARN CASHBACK</b> Check websites like Quidco and TopCashback BEFORE you place your order. Cashback websites PAY you to shop. All you have to do is click through their links and the money is added to your online account, usually within 14 days.</p>
      <p><b>CHECK FOR CODES</b> Take a look at The Sun Vouchers, and see if you can get extra savings with discount codes.</p>
      <p>It’s certainly a strong offer if you fancy treating yourself to a console, or if you’ve been waiting on a decent price for the latest Xbox.</p>
      <p>And with the new Xbox not slated for launch until around Christmas 2020, you can still get around 12 months of good gaming time in.</p>
      <p>It's thought that Microsoft has two consoles in the works, code-named Anaconda and Lockhart.</p>
      <p>They'll hit shelves around the same time as the PlayStation 5, which Sony confirmed it was working on last month.</p>
      <p>eBay is limiting this deal to one purchase per person, so it's worth bearing that in might when you're checking out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Xbox One S + 3x games at eBay for £99 – <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/183989590529">buy here</a></b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Xbox deal sold out? Here's what to do</h3>
      <p>If that Xbox deal sells out, there are still some viable alternatives.</p>
      <p>You can bag the same offer from AO.com for a slightly higher price of £129 here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Xbox One S all digital with three games and a month of Xbox Live Gold, £129 - <a href="https://ao.com/product/njp00056-xbox-one-console-white-72336-291.aspx">buy here</a></b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And Lidl is flogging a similar offer in-store.</p>
      <p>eBay is also re-stocking this deal so keep checking back to see if the offer is back again. It sold out on Thursday, November 28, and was re-stocked within hours.</p>
