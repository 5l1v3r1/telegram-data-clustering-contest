      <p>Alison Hammond accidentally misgendered Caitlyn Jenner whilst talking about the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</a> contestant on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> today.</p>
      <p>The former Big Brother star was presenting a segment alongside hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, discussing all the latest gossip and rumours surrounding the reality show.</p>
      <p>But viewers were shocked to see Alison misgender Caitlyn when conversation turned to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star.</p>
      <p>Referring to Caitlyn by a male pronoun, Alison didn’t seem to notice her mistake. After the misstep, Ruth was forced to step in and correct her co-host, stressing the correct pronoun and speaking over her.</p>

      <p>We’ve already discussed<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/misgendering-im-a-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-isnt-twitter-bants-its-transphobia-11180453/"> why misgendering Caitlyn is a form of transphobia</a>.</p>

      <p>After the incident, viewers took to social media and were already demanding that the TV personality apologise for her faux-pas.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a lot of potential presenters who would be able to address someone with the correct pronouns,’ one fan wrote. ‘Alison Hammond is embarrassing and an awful reflection of the show.’</p>
      <p>‘Alison Hammond has an apology to make there I reckon,’ said another.</p>

      <p>‘Well done Ruth Langsford for correcting her,’ another fan wrote.</p>
      <p>The reality TV icon has certainly become this year’s breakout I’m A Celebrity contestant.</p>
      <p>She even opened up to her campmates about her transition into a woman, and admitted she hasn’t spoken to her step-daughter Khloe Kardashian in years.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn then continued telling the camp: ‘I went through every kid and Khloe for some reason was p***ed off about something through this whole process.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been five or six years and I’ve really haven’t talked to her since.’</p>
      <p>In Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Khloe was seen attempting to come around to Caitlyn by buying her shoes, but it’s been well publicised that the pair have never been able to re-establish their relationship in the wake of her transition.</p>

      <p>‘I’m still the same person that I was, same sense of humour, same everything,’ she told the camp.</p>
      <p>Her blunt honesty has had the full backing of her family, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/kendall-kylie-jenner-going-australia-support-caitlyn-im-celebrity-11234927/">rumours that Kendall and Kylie Jenner, her two biological daughters from her marriage to Kris Jenner, are heading over to Aus</a> to support her when she returns to the real world.</p>
      <p>Over in camp, she’s the reigning leader, with Corrie’s Andy Whyment as her deputy.</p>
