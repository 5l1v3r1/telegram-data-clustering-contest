      <h2>Animal welfare experts are desperate to find new owners for Dec, Brian and Ozzy.</h2>

      <p>Animal welfare experts are looking to find homes for three ferrets who have lived in a rescue centre for 16 months.</p>
      <p>The SSPCA say the cute creatures - Dec, Brian and Ozzy - have been in their Ayrshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre for 491 days in total.</p>
      <p>Manager of the charity's centre, Marion Hainey said: “These three have been with us for a lengthy period so we are desperate to find their forever homes.</p>
      <p>“They are playful, fun and love their cosy beds.</p>
      <p>“A new owner will need to provide plenty of toys to keep their minds occupied and a nice big space to get plenty of exercise. </p>
      <p>“They could potentially go to a home with existing ferrets as long as the males are neutered.</p>
      <p>“An experienced home would suit them best.</p>
      <p>“They are adorable and we can’t understand why there’s been no interest so far.</p>
      <p>“We’re hoping someone reads this who has room in their home and heart for one of these boys.”</p>
      <p>Anyone who is interested in meeting Dec, Brian or Ozzy should contact the Scottish SPCA centre in Ayrshire on 03000 999 999.</p>
