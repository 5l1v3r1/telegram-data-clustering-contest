      <p>It features seven Instagramable locations throughout the region, where mistletoe has been hung and visitors are invited to stop by for a shareable moment - a hug, a kiss and definitely a picture.</p>
      <p>"Visitors and locals are looking for things to do now that the cold weather is here," Minto Schneider, CEO of Explore Waterloo Region said in a release.
