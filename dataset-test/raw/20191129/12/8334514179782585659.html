      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday he wanted to keep in place preparations the government has made for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.</p>
      <p>“Many of those preparations will be extremely valuable as we come out of EU arrangements anyway. So I think that they were a right thing to have done and to keep in a state of readiness,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Johnson added he was confident that Britain would get a free trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020 which would eliminate the risk of a Brexit shock for the economy.</p>
