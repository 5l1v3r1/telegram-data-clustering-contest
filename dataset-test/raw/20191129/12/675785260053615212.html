      <h1>John Hartson questions Freddie Ljungberg appointment after Unai Emery axe</h1>
      <h2>Former Gunners midfielder Ljungberg only made the step up to join Arsenal's first-team coaching set-up this season having worked previously in the club's academy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:44:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> striker John Hartson has questioned the club's appointment of Freddie Ljungberg as interim manager following <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery's</a> sacking.</p>
      <p>The Spanish coach was axed on Friday morning after a run of seven games without a win, as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fredrik-ljungberg">Ljungberg</a> was immediately installed as his successor.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg enjoyed considerable success with Arsenal as part of their 2004 'Invincibles' side, and joined the club's first-team as a coach this season.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old was previously working in the Gunners' academy, most recently as head coach of the under-23's.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/john-hartson">Hartson</a> has blasted the decision to hand Ljungberg the reins, despite conceding that Emery's time was up.</p>

      <p>"Ljungberg was a great help to Emery last night.. sat down for 90 mins.." Hartson tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Surely you get in the manager's ear if you can see what's going wrong.. Emery had to go."</p>
      <p>Emery was axed less than 12 hours after his side fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>

      <p>Gunners fans held up 'Emery Out' banners in protest to the manager, who has watched his team slip to 8th in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>A statement from the club read: "We announce today that the decision has been taken to part company with our head coach Unai Emery and his coaching team.</p>
      <p>“Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand. We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success.”</p>
      <p>Ljungberg now leads a strong list of candidates to fill the role on a full-time basis, along with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> manager Nuno Espirito Santo.</p>
      <p>But one Gunners player apologised to his former boss, suggesting the players were to blame for the club's poor recent results.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez tweeted: "Thank you @UnaiEmery_ and Javi I’m sorry we let you down, it’s our fault for not performing the right way , I’m sure we will meet again."</p>
