      <p>Speaker of the Shura Council, H E Ahmed bin Abdullah bin Zaid Al Mahmoud, has underlined the interest of the State of Qatar under the leadership of Amir H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to deepen partnerships and open new horizons for relations with  brotherly and friendly countries and regional and international groupings, particularly  African countries and organisations to build solid strategic relations based on the principle of constructive cooperation to serve common interests.</p>
      <p>He was speaking at the 42nd Conference of Speakers of Parliaments of the African Parliamentary Union (APU).</p>
      <p>The Speaker said that this interest comes due to the commonalities between the State of Qatar and African countries in various fields, which increases our enthusiasm and our quest to join as an observer member of the African Parliamentary Union to recognise the deep historical ties and common interests of supporting the issues of liberation and development and brotherhood and good neighborliness, and security in our region, and the common destiny of our peoples.</p>
      <p>His Excellency added that Qatar views the Africa as a promising continent that has the essential elements for achieving a better future with its huge economic, productive and consumer potential, as the return on investment in the continent is one of the highest rates in the world, which qualifies it to become the most important pillars of global growth and makes it the most important destination for long-term investment activities due to its strong economic resources and foundations such as the diversity and abundance of natural resources and the presence of a large untapped agricultural area.</p>
      <p>His Excellency pointed out that the Qatar calls for studying priorities, ways to overcome the challenges, and discuss the prospects for cooperation and encourage joint investments with African countries to provide employment opportunities for the people of the promising continent and achieve sustainable development goals.</p>
      <p>His Excellency stressed that the relationship between Qatar and the African continent will continue to develop to broader horizons to cover wider areas for the good of the region and its stability.</p>
      <p>He said that Qatar, thanks to God and the keenness of its leadership, has been able to strengthen its relations with the countries of the continent and to establish partnerships in various economic, social and cultural fields with many countries, and its diplomatic movement through mediation and good offices, contributed to the resolution of some African conflicts between the countries of the continent and some conflicts within these countries,</p>
      <p>His Excellency added that Qatar has also continued its efforts to support African issues in regional and international forums and has supported many countries of the continent in times of hardship and distress arising from conflicts and natural disasters.</p>
      <p>His Excellency said  Qatar has a comprehensive vision of security in the region because it considers that its security is an integral part of the security of the region, and this view is based on the fact that extremism, violence, conflict, war and immigration are caused primarily by the absence of job opportunities, poverty and widespread ignorance among young people, making them vulnerable to all sinister temptations by criminal organizations.</p>
      <p>He added that Qatar has continued to advocate the need to take preventive measures against these phenomena in the region by investing in development projects through direct support and initiatives to provide job opportunities for young people as the pillar of the future, as well as the State of Qatar to contribute $100m to the United Nations to help countries in the face of the effects of climate change, including some countries of the African continent.</p>
      <p>His Excellency pointed out that within the framework of these humanitarian preventive initiatives, H H the Amir directed the establishment of a fund sponsored by the African Union to cover the costs of evacuating irregular African migrants in Libya to their countries and reintegrating them into their communities due to ill-treatment and deteriorating living and health conditions.</p>
      <p>His Excellency hoped that this initiative will serve as a model for other countries to stand with the African Union to resolve this issue, stressing that Qatar has carried out other projects directed by H H the Amir of the State of Qatar, aimed at providing educational opportunities in conflict zones, and recovery and reconstruction projects in war-affected areas such as in Darfur.</p>
      <p>His Excellency said that parliamentarians, in turn, are called upon to contribute effectively to providing security and peace through close parliamentary cooperation on enacting and developing the necessary legislation to ensure that security threats are addressed, including combating organized crime and corruption, illicit trafficking in arms and people, money laundering, violence and other acts and this is the role that the peoples expect from their parliaments. He  expressed his thanks to the Republic of Djibouti, President, parliament and people, to the H E Prime Minister and Representative of the President of the Republic Abdoulkader Kamil, and to Speaker of the House of Representatives of Djibouti Mohamed Ali Hamad for hosting these meetings.</p>
