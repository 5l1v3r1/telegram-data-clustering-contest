      <p>Andy Whyment's sister has hit out at <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp</a> host Adam Thomas after the presenter claimed the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> actor was "playing a game".</p>
      <p>Adam was responding to a joke Andy made in last night's (28.11.19) episode about driving a Kia Ceed, during a discussion about cars.</p>

      <p>American reality star Caitlyn Jenner played a game of 'would you rather' with Andy, DJ Roman Kemp and several others, and they got to talking about her impressive collection of cars and areoplanes.</p>
      <p>The former Olympian bragged about owning a super fast Porsche, which prompted Andy to admit he drove a Kia Ceed and jokingly challenge her to a race.</p>
      <p>On Extra Camp, hosts Emily Atack, Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas were joined by presenters <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> for a chat about the episode, which saw the celebs take on three gruelling <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celeb-fans-in-hysterics-as-cliff-sings-rude-song/">Reckoning challenges</a>.</p>

      <p>Emily said, "Andy made me laugh soooo much in this episode" and Ant agreed, "Good episode for Andy, it was".</p>
      <p>"It was, the Kia Ceed," Emily continued, adding: "I have to be honest, I don't know about cars because I don't drive. So I thought Kia Ceed was a type of vegan porridge."</p>
      <p>Shockingly, Adam then blurted out: "I think Andy's playing a game now. He's not got a Kia Ceed! He was just paid a lot of money to say that."</p>

      <p>The other hosts exploded with a mix of disbelief and outrage, with Emily and Joel Dommett shouting "No!" and Ant telling him, "No way! Shut up".</p>
      <p>Adam then backtracked somewhat as he said: "I'm joking. Imagine though. No, for me Andy's just brilliant in there. He brings a bit of laughter, a bit of fun as well."</p>
      <aside>He really is just the nicest down-to-earth person and I couldn't be any more proud of him.</aside>
      <p>Afterwards, Andy's sister Lisa took to Twitter to hit back at the claims and defend her brother.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: "For the record @adamthomas21, my brother does drive a Kia Ceed and is not playing a 'game'!</p>
      <p>"He really is just the nicest down-to-earth person and I couldn't be any more proud of him @imacelebrity @antanddec #ImACeleb #AndyToWin #imacelebrity."</p>
