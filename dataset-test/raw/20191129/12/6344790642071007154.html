      <h1>Zack Snyder Doesn't Want DC Fans to Lose Hope in the JUSTICE LEAGUE SNYDER CUT</h1>

      <p>DC fans who have been supporting the release of the <b><i>Justice League Snyder Cut </i></b>got a dose of reality this week when a studio insider said that the whole thing is a “pipe dream” and that “there’s no way it’s ever happening.”</p>
      <p>Warner Bros. has no plans to release the movie for various reasons. One of the biggest reasons is the fact that it’s not 100% complete. There’s still a lot of work that would need to be done on it before it was released, and I just don’t think WB is ever going to put any more money into completing the film.</p>
      <p>As fans have started to lose hope, the director of the film doesn’t want them to. A fan reached out to Snyder saying, "Say something. I am losing hope." To which Snyder responded, “Don’t.”</p>

      <p>I still don’t think that anything will ever happen with it. This <i>Snyder Cut </i>will not see the light of day unless someone decided to leak it. But, Snyder wants to keep the hope alive for the fans. Yeah, if it was released I’d watch it, but I’m also going to be fine if it never gets released. It’s not really something that I need to see.</p>
      <p>Do you honestly think it’ll ever be released?</p>
