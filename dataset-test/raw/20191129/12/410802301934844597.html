      <p>They might’ve set the benchmark for on-field excellence in Super Rugby, but the Crusaders won’t be winning prizes for logo design anytime soon.</p>
      <p>The ten-time Super Rugby winners on Friday revealed their new badge, dropping the knight and sword symbol following a fierce debate over its appropriateness after March’s mosque shootings in Christchurch.</p>
      <p>A brand review in mid-year prompted the revamp, given that the knight motif was felt to  have linked the club to the medieval Crusades, wars between Christians and Muslims.</p>
      <p>According to a statement by the franchise, the new logo represents The Tohu, “the natural landscape in the region, stretching from the top of the Southern Alps to the depths of our moana”.</p>
      <p>However, according to some Twitter users, it looks more like “two semi-erect penises kissing each other”.</p>

      <p>Other commentators were more diplomatic, with <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/117834833/crusaders-logo-change-what-do-people-think">stuff.co.nz</a> noting descriptions of “awkard” and “tokenised”.</p>
      <p>“It looks a bit awkward, it doesn’t look refined,” said Dr Johnson Witehira​, an artist with a doctorate in Māori visual art.</p>
