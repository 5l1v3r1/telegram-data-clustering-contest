        <li>The pair split in 2017 after being married for two years, but have remained on good terms and close friends since.</li>
        <li>Aniston appeared in a group photo posted on Theroux’s Instagram stories, alongside a host of other celebrities including <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29659458/courteney-cox-scream-3-bangs-halloween/">fellow <i>Friends</i> star Courteney Cox</a>, Jimmy Kimmel and Jason Bateman.</li>

      <p>If there’s anyone you don’t wanna be sitting across from at Thanksgiving dinner, it’s probably your ex. Stuffing, turkey, yams, gravy… All welcome at the table, but exes? It’s gonna be a hard pass. Unless you’re Jennifer Aniston, of course, who just spent Thanksgiving 2019 with her ex-husband, Justin Theroux.</p>
      <p>It’s not actually a huge deal for these two, as the pair have remained close friends since their surprising <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a23388539/justin-theroux-talks-jennifer-aniston-divorce-first-time/">split in 2017 following two years of marriage</a>. In recent times, they’ve <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29736318/justin-theroux-tags-jennifer-aniston-instagram/">tagged each other in cute dog posts</a> on social media, and <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a26302602/justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-birthday-message/">shared heartfelt birthday messages to one another</a>. They’re ultimate break-up goals that not many people can relate to.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29746525/jennifer-aniston-mugshot-instagram-the-morning-show/"><i>The Morning Show</i> star almost broke the internet</a> by joining the app back in October, it was Theroux who this time caused a stir on Instagram. He shared a group selfie on his stories to reveal all of the A-listers who’d been hanging out together for Thanksgiving, and fans were quick to spot Aniston up front amongst the famous faces.</p>

      <p>The group shot shows Aniston looking beautiful and happy right alongside her <i>Parks and Recreation</i> ex. You might also notice her fellow <i>Friends </i>alumni Courteney Cox, TV’s Jimmy Kimmel, plus Jason Bateman, and Will Arnett. It’s the ultimate celebrity game of "Where’s Waldo?".</p>
      <p>Theroux, who began dating Aniston back in May 2011, captioned the sweet pic: "Very VERY thankful for these friends and these nights," adding the hashtag “#Fakesgiving."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, JenAn shared her own post from the festivities. It didn’t feature her ex-husband, but did showcase her contribution to the Thanksgiving dinner. She’d whipped up enchiladas especially for Jimmy Kimmel, as she explained: "Ok, @jimmykimmel... here are your f*%king Friendsgiving enchiladas.”</p>

      <p>You might remember that, during her appearance on his show last year, the host asked Aniston not to make a traditional turkey dinner for their annual celebrations this time around, so it looks like she made notes.</p>
      <p>Maybe we should all be a little more thankful for exes... No? Okay then.</p>
