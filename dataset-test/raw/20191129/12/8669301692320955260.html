      <p>A Congress MLA in Madhya Pradesh threatened to “burn” Bharatiya Janata Party MP Pragya Singh Thakur if she entered his constituency following her controversial remark calling Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/945096/pragya-thakur-again-refers-to-nathuram-godse-as-a-patriot-this-time-in-the-lok-sabha">Nathuram Godse a “patriot”</a> in Lok Sabha, PTI reported.</p>
      <p>Congress MLA Govardhan Dangi issued the threat on Thursday but apologised on Friday, claiming it was a mistake.</p>
      <p>“We will burn not just her effigy...if she sets foot here, we will burn her also,” the MLA said while speaking to reporters in Rajgarh district.</p>
      <p>The Congress MLA from Biaora also staged a protest against Thakur’s comments. “Nothing can be more disgusting than praising Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, after his comments also triggered a controversy, Dangi said he firmly believed in the Gandhian principle of non-violence. “I meant to say that the people of Rajgarh district will boycott her,” he said. “There was some mistake in speaking. We are followers of Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence... I apologise for it.”</p>
      <p>The state Congress unit distanced itself from Dangi’s comments.</p>
      <p>Thakur on Friday <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/945267/godse-remarks-were-distorted-i-was-called-a-terrorist-by-an-mp-pragya-thakur-in-lok-sabha">apologised for her comments</a> but maintained that she did not call Nathuram Godse a patriot.</p>
      <p>Following her remarks, the BJP had on Thursday barred Thakur from attending any meeting of the parliamentary party and dropped her from the <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/945142/after-pragya-thakurs-godse-remark-bjp-working-chief-says-she-will-be-removed-from-defence-panel">consultative committee on defence</a>. The Opposition’s uproar had also prompted Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to tell the Lok Sabha that the BJP condemned any philosophy that described Godse as a patriot.</p>
      <p>Thakur had claimed that she had made the remark in defence of revolutionary <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/945162/godse-remarks-pragya-thakur-claims-outburst-was-for-udham-singh-calls-criticism-storm-of-lies">Udham Singh</a>.</p>
      <p>Opposition parties had attacked the government, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and claimed that the party’s “inaction” against Thakur proved its tacit support for her.</p>
