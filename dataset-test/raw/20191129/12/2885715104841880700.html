      <p>A court here has issued summons against Bollywood actor Ameesha Patel in a Rs 10 lakh cheque bounce case, and asked her to remain present before it on January 27 next year.</p>
      <p>Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Manish Bhatt issued the summons on Wednesday after registering a complaint against the 43-year-old actor under section 318 of Negotiable Instruments Act.</p>
      <p>“The JMFC directed the actor to remain present before it on January 27,” petitioner Nisha Chhipa’s counsel, Durgesh Sharma, told reporters on Friday.</p>
      <p>According to him, Ameesha had borrowed Rs 10 lakh from Chhipa for a film production.</p>
      <p>“The actor had given a cheque of Rs 10 lakh to my client for repayment, but it got dishonoured as she did not have adequate balance in her bank account,” Sharma said.</p>
      <p>Ameesha made her acting debut in 2000 with romantic thriller Kaho Naa…Pyaar Hai, directed by Rakesh Roshan.</p>
      <p>She rose to prominence through Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (2001), which became one of the biggest hits in Bollywood.</p>
