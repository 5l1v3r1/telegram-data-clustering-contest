      <h1>Upcoming 2020 Audi e-tron EV SUV gets improved range and a new sporty trim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:28:10+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Audi India has showcased the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/audi/e-tron-m728/">Audi e-tron</a> electric SUV in India, ahead of its launch in the next few months. This is the first all-electric SUV from the German brand and is a major component of its new strategy for India, which is now focused on petrols and electrified models. Now, however, the brand has updated the e-tron internationally, which has made it more efficient. We think this updated version is the one that might come to India.</p>

      <p>The upgrades to the e-tron have added 25 km to its range. This has led to the range get to 436 km on the WLTP cycle. The improvements have come via the use of a new type of wheel brake which has led to lesser residual brake torque. These are the energy losses through friction that take place because of the brake callipers being in close proximity to the brake discs. Another improvement is that the front motor can be entirely decoupled from the propulsion system. The e-tron functions only on its rear motor under normal loads now with the front motor only waking up under heavier inputs. The 96 kWh battery also features better charge density now with a usable capacity of 86.5 kWh. Other advancements have been made to the thermal management system, which means that the temperature of the e-tron's high-voltage components can be controlled more efficiently. The final improvement is that the e-tron SUV can also now regenerate energy most effectively now while coasting.</p>

      <p>Aside from the improvements in efficiency, which are a result of the development of the recently revealed Audi e-tron Sportback, the e-tron SUV now also gets a sportier S-Line trim level. This adds new trim like the 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension. Cosmetic changes are new front bumper with more pronounced air curtains, allowing for better air-flow. Further, there is S-Line badging on the grille, illuminated aluminium door 'S' door sill, a standard-fit spoiler and a new diffuser at the rear. Another differentiator is that the dual-tone colour scheme of the standard car has been ditched for body coloured wheel arch trims, door sills, bumpers and exterior mirrors. Lastly, a black styling package is available as an optional extra. This brings dark elements to the grille, side windows, the bumper and the mirror housings.</p>
      <p>All of the efficiency changes are applicable to the top Quattro 55 trim. A new Quattro 50 version has also been introduced with a smaller 71 kWh battery and 336 km range. Outputs are 313PS and 540 Nm. This version has a 190 kmph top speed and gets to 100 kmph from standstill in 6.8s.</p>

      <p>We think Audi India will bring the updated e-tron to India when it introduces it here. The EV is being brought in as a CBU under the new rule that allows 2,500 units to be directly imported by a manufacturer. It expects to sell around 200 of these SUVs here in a year and order books have already started filling up.</p>
