      <h2>There is a 'slim possibility' missing man Jason Goldrick, who disappeared from hospital nearly a month ago, could still be alive.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:19:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author">Wes Holmes</a></address>
      <p>Jason Goldrick disappeared on November 1, and police issued a missing persons appeal before arresting a 47-year-old resort man on suspicion of his murder.</p>
      <p>He was released under investigation today.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman has now said that 'there is a possibility, albeit slim, (Mr Goldrick) could still be alive', as no body has been found in their search.</p>
      <p>Mr Goldrick, 50, was last seen leaving Blackpool Victoria Hospital at around 10pm on Friday, November 1.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, police arrested their 47-year-old suspect.</p>
      <p>Following his release today, police again described Mr Goldrick as 'missing', and asked people to check their sheds and garages in case he had “sought shelter”.</p>
      <p>A home in Park Road, central Blackpool, has been searched, while CCTV is being checked – with a drone also being used in the hunt for Mr Goldrick or his body.</p>
      <p>Det Ch Insp Derry Crorken said: “Our enquiries are very much continuing to try to find Jason and I would appeal for the public’s help in checking any sheds, garages or outside areas in case Mr Goldrick has sought shelter there.</p>
      <p>“A man arrested on suspicion of murder has been released from custody but remains under investigation and I have a team of officers and staff continuing to work hard to try and find out what has happened to Jason and where he might be.”</p>
      <p>Mr Goldrick described as white, 5ft 8ins tall, with a medium build and greying short hair. He was last seen wearing a long-sleeved dark blue jumper without a hood, dark blue joggers and black trainers.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact Blackpool Police with any information on 101 quoting log 1156 of November 6. For immediate sightings call 999.</p>
      <p>You can also call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
