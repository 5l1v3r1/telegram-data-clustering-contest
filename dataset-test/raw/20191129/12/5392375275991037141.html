      <p>Vivo is gearing up to unveil the Vivo X30 as soon as in the next month. For that reason, the Chinese firm is ramping up its teaser campaign to keep all eyes over its new smartphone. Interestingly enough, it seems that Vivo isn’t really concerned in exposing the handset before the time. We already have a clear picture of the back with it, periscope shooter. Today, Vivo’s official <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1809745371/Iiq7Gm0vY">Weibo account</a> revealed the first lifestyle shots of the phone.</p>

      <p>Once again, we can see the Vivo X30 in all its glory. The new teaser features Liu Wen, one of the most famous Chinese supermodels, and reveals the Red and Pearl White/Aurora gradients. Worth noting that the Pearl White/Aurora has already been seen in the previous X30 leak. But it is the first time that we are seeing this Red color finish. The source calls it “Red”, but it actually looks like the usual Rose Gold or even Coral.</p>
      <p>Vivo states that the X30 will be a phone for professional shots with its ultra-powerful 60x zoom. It will also be a good accessory to complement your outwear. According to reports, the company will ship both 4G and 5G variants of the Vivo X30. It will be the second smartphone in Vivo’s portfolio to come with support for the next-gen network (Currently, we only have NEX 3 5G).</p>
      <p>The Vivo X30 may debut with Exynos 980 and JoviOS – A rebranded version of its FunTouch OS based on Android 10.</p>
