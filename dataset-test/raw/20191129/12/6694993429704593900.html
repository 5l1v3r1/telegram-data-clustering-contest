      <h1>Newcastle boss provides line up and injury news ahead of Man City fixture</h1>
      <h2>The Magpies stunned Manchester City last season at St James' Park and will be looking for more of the same on Saturday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:42:57+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author">Thomas Bristow, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/thomas-bristow/</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce has provided line up and injury updates ahead of his side's crunch clash against <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The two teams square off in the lunchtime fixture with the visitors hoping to close the gap on Premier League leaders Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp's side sit top of the table, eight points clear of second-place Leicester City and nine in front of City.</p>
      <p>The Blues fell to a shock 2-1 defeat away at Newcastle last season but it may have been the best thing to have happened to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola's</a> team. Following the loss City went on a 14-game winning streak and overtook Liverpool to be crowned Premier League champions for the second season running.</p>
      <p>With City facing a similarly daunting task this term, can they use this fixture as their launchpad?</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the fixture, Bruce said of his opponents: "They’re as good as you get.</p>
      <p>"We’ll have to defend well and take our chances but we’ve done OK against some of the big teams this season. Let’s hope we can again."</p>
      <p>Newcastle's front three have come under fire this season for not providing the goods, with some fans asking for a change up top. But Bruce insists he's sticking with Miguel Almiron, Allan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton for the City game.</p>
      <p>"The question people are always going to ask is how long do you wait to change it?" said the Magpies manager.</p>
      <p>"I’d been delighted with the front three before Villa but obviously, we all want them to score. It’s about getting that balance right.</p>
      <p>"For now, I’ll persevere with them."</p>
      <p>In terms of injury and team news, Bruce is pleased to see Sean Longstaff return from suspension while Matt Ritchie remains sidelined until the new year with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>DeAndre Yedlin, meanwhile, is ruled out with a hip problem. Jamaal Lascelles is also still out.</p>
