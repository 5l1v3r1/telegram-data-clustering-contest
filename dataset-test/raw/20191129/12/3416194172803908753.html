      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/dinah-jane/"><b>Dinah Jane</b></a> goes old school glam for the beauty cover of <i>In Love</i> magazine’s new issue.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old singer opened up about her beauty secrets and rituals, and also opened up about how her solo music differs from <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/fifth-harmony/"><b>Fifth Harmony</b></a>‘s.</p>
      <p>“My creative process is pretty smooth. I’ll come straight into the room as an open book, ready to bring a topic to life,” <b>Dinah </b>shares. “The difference is that the music and project revolve around only one girl now, so whatever I’m envisioning will be 100 percent about me; nobody else.”</p>
      <p>She continues, “I’m taking you on a journey of being in my shoes – what’s it’s like to be with me and, or, be like me.”</p>
      <p><b>Dinah </b>also opened up about the shift in her music to be as authentic as possible.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to surround yourself with people who know you better than anyone else – or better yet, know you better than you know yourself. I told myself, ‘The only music you’re going to be making from here on out is music that speaks to you and is honest.’”</p>
      <p><b>Dinah </b>adds, “‘These aren’t anyone else’s records but yours, so don’t waste time creating something that has no connection to you or something your heart isn’t in, because at that point you are doing a disservice to yourself as an artist.’”</p>
