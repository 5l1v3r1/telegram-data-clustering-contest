      <h1>Canadiens’ Jonathan Drouin reveals he tore tendon in his wrist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:48:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/eric-engels/" target="_blank">Eric Engels</a></address>
      <p>BROSSARD, Que.— <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/teams/montreal-canadiens/">Montreal Canadiens</a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/jonathan-drouin/741406">Jonathan Drouin</a> spoke on Friday for the first time since his Nov. 18 surgery, and he explained that he suffered a torn tendon in his left wrist on his first shift of the third period in the team’s 5-2 win over the Washington Capitals on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>“I just fell on my wrist and twisted it,” Drouin said. “It’s just bad luck.”</p>
      <p>Drouin’s expected timeline for recovery, approximated at eight weeks, hasn’t changed.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old said that the surgery was a success, that he was in a cast for two weeks and is now in a splint for the next number of weeks. He added that he should be able to resume cardiovascular training over the coming days.</p>
      <p>But Drouin has no timeline as to when he’ll be able to use his wrist.</p>
      <p>“I’m still in pain,” Drouin said.</p>
      <p>He’s also frustrated about the timing of his injury — he had seven goals and 15 points and was among the Canadiens’ leading scorers — and the fact that he’s unavailable to help the team out of its current six-game winless streak.</p>
      <p>“It’s disappointing,” the Ste. Agathe, Que., native said.</p>
      <p>“But it’s part of hockey. I’m not the first player to suffer an injury and I won’t be the last, either. It’s up to me just keep my head up, have a good attitude and just continue to not lose it too much mentally because it could be awhile.</p>
      <p>“Every athlete will tell you that when they can’t make a difference and they just have to wait around and watch what’s happening, it’s hard. I’m frustrated to see what’s happening on the ice and the results that we’re generating. Making a difference is why you’re part of a hockey team. It’s disappointing and it sucks (to not be able to help), but I’m trying to be positive also off the ice.”</p>
      <p>Drouin is one of two Canadiens currently on the injured reserve list.</p>
      <p>Forward Paul Byron had arthroscopic knee surgery on Nov. 19 and is expected to be sidelined until the fourth week of December.</p>
