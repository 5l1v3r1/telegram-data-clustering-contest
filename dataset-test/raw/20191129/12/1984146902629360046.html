      <p>Fashion brand Jack Will has opened a new store in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Jack Wills' new unit is in St Andrew's Way, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/eldon-square">Eldon Square</a> , next door to Monki. It means Jack Wills is back in town, having closed its shop in Blackett Street earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Eldon Square, Samsung has opened its new store next to Lush and Clintons, in the unit vacated by Game when Game shut down, before later reopening in another part of the shopping centre.</p>

      <p>Gavin Prior, regional centre director at intu Eldon Square said: "We’re really excited to welcome two new retailers, especially hot on the heels of Morphe’s successful opening. We’re confident that both Jack Wills and Samsung will be hugely popular amongst our customers – especially in the lead up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>"As we approach the end of the year, it’s fantastic to see three new brands join us at intu Eldon Square complementing our current retail offering perfectly."</p>
