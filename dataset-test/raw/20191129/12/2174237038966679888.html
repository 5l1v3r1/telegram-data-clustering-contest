      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-best-iron-maiden-songs-of-all-time">Iron Maiden</a>’s Steve Harris is a well-known supporter of Premier League outfit West Ham United – and today, the bassist has helped launch a special collaboration between the band and the club.</p>
      <p>The <i>Die With Your Boots On</i> partnership sees the famous Iron Maiden logo emblazoned on front of the West Ham shirt – and Harris, who regularly sports the team colours onstage, is delighted.</p>
      <p>He says: “I went to see West Ham play against Newcastle when I was nine and my mate was 10. We jumped on a bus and went to the game, and they won 4-3 and that was it. I was hooked!”</p>
      <p>As for the kit itself, Harris says: “I think it’s brilliant. I really love that version and colour of the crest, and that old classic kind of kit. It’s a modern shape but with a retro design, and I like that. Up the Irons!”</p>
      <p>The bassist launched the kit, <a href="https://www.officialwesthamstore.com/">which is available to buy from the club’s website</a>, beside Argentina defender Pablo Zabaleta, who adds: “Iron Maiden are a huge icon back home in South America and it’s great for fans of West Ham and the band to be able to show their support for both!”</p>
      <p>As for how the collaboration came about, West Ham’s licensing manager Tracey Stratton takes up the story.</p>
      <p>“One weekend last summer, our club shop was inundated with rock fans from all across the globe, and we realised that Iron Maiden were playing two sold out shows at the O2,” Stratton says.</p>
      <p>“It makes perfect sense to launch this collaboration, and with Steve’s passion for it and attention to detail it has been amazing.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/iron-maiden-extend-the-legacy-of-the-beast-tour-into-2020">Iron Maiden revealed they were extending <i>The Legacy Of The Beast</i> tour into 2020</a>. They’ll also headline the <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/iron-maiden-kiss-and-system-of-a-down-to-headline-download-uk-2020">UK’s Download festival</a> next summer.</p>
