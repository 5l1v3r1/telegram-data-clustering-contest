      <p>A rat-sniffing dog ended up stranded on an uninhabited Pacific island unable to eat or drink after running away from his handler when a sealion jumped out of a bush and spooked him.</p>
      <p>Flint, a Jack Russell-fox terrier cross, found himself lost and alone on Campbell Island, located between mainland New Zealand and Antarctica, when bad weather forced crews to abandon their search efforts.</p>
      <p>He was there as part of Operation Endurance, a work programme involving around 100 conservation rangers, weather officials and members of New Zealand’s military.</p>
      <p>The island is one of dozens cleared of predators, including rodents, to allow endangered native birds to flourish and Flint had been deployed to check that no rats had returned.</p>
      <p>To make his ordeal worse, he’d been fitted with a standard-issue muzzle that prevents any of the dogs potentially attacking the rare, flightless birds – making eating or drinking practically impossible.</p>

      <p>John McCarroll, the Department of Conservation’s acting operations manager for the area, described how crews scoured the dense bush on foot while the military scrambled a helicopter equipped with thermal imaging to search the rest of the island.</p>
      <p>But bad weather and mechanical issues affecting the navy ship they’d arrived on a week earlier meant the team were forced to make the heart-breaking decision to leave Flint behind late on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>However, back on mainland New Zealand, plans were in motion for a rescue operation and another helicopter was dispatched on Friday carrying three crew members 400 miles across the south Pacific.</p>
      <p>When they arrived at base, they found Flint waiting for them after he’d made the three-hour hike back from where he went missing.</p>
      <p>‘At first he was scared of the noise of the helicopter,’ Mr McCarroll said.</p>
      <p>‘They called him once, they called him twice, and then he was happy to come and greet them.’</p>
      <p>Flint arrived back on the mainland on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>He even managed to beat his handler, Richard Johnston, who isn’t expected back with the rest of the crew on the navy ship until early next week.</p>

      <p>Mr McCarroll added: ‘He was in very good spirits. We gave him some more food and he wolfed that down. He looks healthy, he looks happy and pleased to be home.’</p>
