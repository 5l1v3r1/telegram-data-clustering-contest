      <p>Scientists have developed a robot personal trainer to coach runners through an exercise programme on the treadmill.</p>
      <p>Humanoid robot Pepper can tell jokes, show sympathy, lean in towards the runner and change eye colour to express different emotions.</p>
      <p>The support is personalised based on the gym-goer’s heart rate, speed, personality type, mood and fitness level.</p>
      <p>Pepper gained its social intelligence by being trained by a human fitness instructor on how to be an encouraging coach.</p>
      <p>It learned when to offer praise during a workout and the cues that can motivate a runner to improve performance.</p>
      <p>The robot was developed as part of a study led by human-robot interaction experts from Bristol Robotics Laboratory.</p>
      <p>As part of the research, 10 people participated in sessions with the robot in a gym at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol).</p>
      <p>The group, aged between their 20s and 60s, attended three times per week for three months and were guided through the NHS Couch to 5K programme.</p>
      <p>Human-robot interaction expert Katie Winkle said: “We wanted to test if we could transfer the intelligence of our fitness instructor, an expert with the know-how to get the best out of clients, into a robot so it could become an effective personal coach.</p>
      <p>“We aimed to create an engaging motivational companion to get our runners through Couch to 5k, which is quite a long and drawn out exercise programme.”</p>
      <p>Participants received guidance from two different versions of the robot.</p>

      <p>The first was pre-programmed and gave standard instructions every 30 seconds based on the runner’s performance.</p>
      <p>The second was a bespoke form of the robot that had been given input from a UWE Bristol fitness instructor.</p>
      <p>Pepper observed the fitness instructor motivating runners and replicated his behaviours.</p>
      <p>Results showed runners preferred engaging with the socially intelligent, human-like robot and performed better with it.</p>
      <p>Miss Winkle said: “Understandably, they weren’t sure what to expect and when they started it was a bit of novelty.</p>
      <p>“Some were energised by the robot and pushed themselves more than normal, and our fitness instructor was impressed with what the robot had learned to do.</p>
      <p>“As time wore on, the participants began to treat the robot as a companion and the fitness instructor saw the robot as a colleague.</p>
      <p>“This is really promising when we think about how robots might be used in the workplace in the future to work alongside humans.”</p>

      <p>Researchers say the study was the first of its kind to feature significant participation from a human expert in a field.</p>
      <p>The UWE fitness instructor was involved in designing Pepper’s actions, teaching it and then assisting with evaluation.</p>
      <p>It is also rare for a research project to involve people interacting with a robot consistently over such a long time, the researchers say.</p>
      <p>Dr Severin Lemaignan, senior research fellow at Bristol Robotics Laboratory, said: “Our work shows a robot could be really useful in the gym, especially for people who would perhaps feel embarrassed with a human personal trainer.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to see the robot was considered a colleague by our gym coach: the robot helps provide better support to the gym clients; he doesn’t see it as a threat to his role.</p>
      <p>“More widely, the study demonstrated the potential for robots to be useful and effective in the real world, with many potential applications.”</p>
      <p>Bristol Robotics Laboratory is a collaborative partnership between UWE Bristol and the University of Bristol.</p>
