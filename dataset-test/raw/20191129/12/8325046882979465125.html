      <p>Passengers arriving from the US this week at London’s Heathrow Airport were picking up more than just their luggage in the baggage claim area of Terminal 5.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.co.uk/">Whole Foods Market UK</a> partnered with the airport to give passengers traveling in from five US-originating flights on Wednesday morning a slice of home by sending <a href="https://www.insider.com/costco-is-already-selling-pumpkin-pies-6-2019-9">pumpkin pies</a> down a baggage belt in wicker baskets to <a href="https://www.insider.com/regional-thanksgiving-dishes-us-2017-11">celebrate Thanksgiving.</a></p>
      <p>Ross Baker, Chief Commercial Officer for Heathrow, said: “Heathrow is by far the biggest gateway for Americans traveling into the UK – we are expecting to welcome more than 700,000 passengers from the US into Heathrow between now and the New Year. Whether they are here for business, vacation or visiting family, we’re happy to show them US Hospitality, UK-style and celebrate Thanksgiving with them.”</p>

      <p>“Thanksgiving is the busiest time of year for our seven UK grocery stores, as American expats seek out the tastes and traditions of home. And while turkey might get first billing on the day, we know that it’s just not an American Thanksgiving without pie,” said Jade Hoai, Director of Purchasing and Operations for Whole Foods Market UK.</p>
