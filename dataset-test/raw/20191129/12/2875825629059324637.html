      <p>Lorraine Kelly bursts into tears FOUR times during her fabulous 60th birthday special.</p>
      <p>The much-loved Scottish TV presenter marked the milestone with an unscripted episode of her show - and had no idea what was in store.</p>
      <p>After being surprised by Ben Shephard, who took over the show while wearing a kilt,  nervous Lorraine, confessed: "It’s quite scary! I’m feeling quite emotional actually, I’ve no idea what’s going to happen."</p>
      <p>Lorraine watched Chris Kamara jump out of a cake, Craig David saw her on a Friday and she received birthday messages from some very famous faces.</p>
      <p>After crying at the start of the show, Lorraine was wiping away the tears once again when the army and cadets announced she was being given the title of Honorary Colonel of the Army Cadets across the UK</p>
