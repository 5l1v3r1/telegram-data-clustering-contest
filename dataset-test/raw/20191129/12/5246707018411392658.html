      <p>Back in 1993, during that year's annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, a Sonic the Hedgehog float was damaged thanks to high winds and ended up injuring two people as a result. Strangely, footage of the incident has been practically impossible to come by - until now.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/26-years-later-footage-surfaces-of-sonic-the-hedgehogs-1840087168">Kotaku</a>, reports of the crash up until this point have used still photographs of the float or videos of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_S5P-Zr4Qw">lying on the ground</a> after the incident. You'd think someone would have captured the event on film though, right?</p>
      <p>Well, ABC7NY has now shared archive footage of the 1997 Macyâ€™s Parade, where a Cat in the Hat float also injured four people. It's only shown for the briefest of moments, but tucked away inside the video is a short clip of Sonic's face bursting on a lamppost before falling to the floor in the 1993 parade. Thankfully, the child and police officer who suffered injuries as a result were OK.</p>
      <p>You can see it all take place from around the 1:37 mark:</p>

      <p>Floats at this year's Macy's Parade survived without too many hiccups, apart from a Ronald McDonald balloon which was blown into a tree before slowly deflating more and more as it was dragged around the streets.</p>
