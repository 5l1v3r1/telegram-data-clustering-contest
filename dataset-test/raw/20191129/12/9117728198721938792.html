        <b>Earlier this week Honda and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> confirmed that they would extend their partnership into 2021. Christian Horner has now revealed why Honda did not want to commit to Formula 1 beyond that.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Helmut Marko confirmed in an interview with Servus TV that they would be continuing to work together into the 2021 season, the first with the new regulations. Red Bull and Honda have had a positive first season, achieving three race wins, courtesy of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> in Austria, Germany and Brazil. </p>
      <p>Their original deal was set to run until just 2020 but the new agreement will be until 2021, but why no longer? Christian Horner told Sky Sports, Honda want to see how the new regulations play out, especially in the financial department.</p>
