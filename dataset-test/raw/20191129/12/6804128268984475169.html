      <h1>Eddie Howe responds to West Ham links as pressure continues to surround Manuel Pellegrini</h1>
      <h2>Howe is the bookies favourite to take the reigns in east London should the Hammers boss get the heave</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Eddie Howe has said he isn't distracted by rumours linking him with replacing Manuel Pellegrini as manager at West Ham as the Chilean remains under big pressure in east London.</p>
      <p>Howe has jumped to the bookies favourite to take over from Pellegrini should the Hammers decide to go in a new direction, with some bookmakers offering odds of 10/11 for the Bournemouth boss to make the move.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini's team haven't won since September 22 and have lost five of their last seven games as they have dropped down the Premier League standings like a stone from fifth to 17th.</p>
      <p>Howe had had admiring glances from other clubs for some time as he has established Bournemouth as a solid Premier League outfit in what is now their fifth season in the top flight following promotion.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old Cherries manager was asked about links to both West Ham and Everton, who have an equally under pressure manager in Marco Silva on the hot seat, ahead of their visit to Spurs this weekend.</p>
      <p>Howe responded: "I always say it's definitely not distracting for me.</p>
      <p>"I shelter myself away from any kind of news that doesn't influence the team I’m preparing to play.</p>

      <p>"I always say if I’m linked, or my players are linked with other clubs then that has to be flattering, it has to be viewed as a good thing. But I spend no time focusing on those things. All week has been preparing for Tottenham."</p>
      <p>The manager added however that in the future, anything can happen.</p>
      <p>"I think I learned a long time ago in football to never try and predict the future and never try to look to far ahead.</p>
      <p>"For me, the next game is always on the horizon. The next game is the utmost priority in my mind. Preparation for that has been very good this week. That can’t change.</p>
      <p>"I never try to look too far ahead now because I've seen so many managers lose their jobs when they look secure. So many unpredictable things happen in football, why waste the energy looking too far ahead?"</p>
      <p>Howe, Sean Dyche, Chris Hughton and David Moyes have all been linked with taking over from Pellegrini should he get the boot, with the next two games against Chelsea and Wolves crucial to Pellegrini's future.</p>

      <p>Pellegrini himself said he doesn't listen to speculation surrounding his own future when he faced the media on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"I don t read too much. I am working here, as I said, it’s a challenge to come here, to try to grow this club," Pellegrini said.</p>
      <p>"When you arrive at one club, you must have a goal. For me maybe, and I said this a couple of months ago, I always want to be in Europe. I want to grow.</p>
      <p>"I am not working here just for work. If my work here is just for 12th, 14th, 15th, to be in the Premier League, I am not the manager."</p>
