      <h1>Jonathan Woodgate delivers shattering Middlesbrough injury update ahead of Leeds clash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:45:38+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/middlesbrough-news-transfers-live-leeds-17335231">Jonathan Woodgate has told Teesside Live</a> that Middlesbrough could be without seven key players for their trip to Elland Road to take on Leeds United on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Leeds come into the match full of confidence and will be expected to secure three points against former Leeds star Woodgate, who has struggled since taking over at The Riverside. Boro currently sit in 20th place in the Championship.</p>
      <p>The Whites, meanwhile, are taking a step closer to promotion with every victory. They sit in second place under Marcelo Bielsa, five points ahead of third-placed Fulham and two behind West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Middlesbrough’s trip to Leeds, Woodgate revealed he could be missing seven crucial first-team players ahead of the clash – confirming that Rudy Gestede, Darren Randolph, Ryan Shotton, Marcus Browne and George Friend will definitely be sidelined. Both Britt Assombalonga and Paddy McNair are doubtful.</p>

      <p>“Have you got a long bit of paper,” <a href="https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/middlesbrough-news-transfers-live-leeds-17335231">Woodgate said,</a> when asked about injuries. “Rudy is out, Browne, Shotton, Friend, Randolph. Britt is 50/50, Paddy McNair doubtful. Three games in six days, it’s difficult.</p>
      <p>“I know my players will come back fighting. George Saville is back, which is a plus.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – The key battle: Bamford v Ayala</h3>
      <p>Daniel Ayala has been linked with a move to Leeds of late, which came as a surprise to many given he has wound up Leeds fans when the two sides have met. Patrick Bamford has become somewhat of a wind up himself of late.</p>
      <p>Whoever comes out on top between the duo will surely be a crucial factor in the outcome of the match. Just a little bit of extra spice, the duo combined during Bamford’s spell as Boro’s leading marksman.</p>
