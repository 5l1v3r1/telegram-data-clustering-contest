      <p>The award-winning Operating Theatre Live is the UK's only public surgical experience and the demonstration came to the College's Paget Road campus on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>50 students, who are studying for A Levels or BTEC diplomas in science, got hands-on in a dissection-based surgical workshop in a simulated operating theatre to further develop their knowledge of anatomy and physiology.</p>
      <p>They donned their surgical scrubs to dissect real specimens, which are believed to be from pigs, including brains, spinal cords, eyes, hearts, lungs and diaphragm.</p>
      <p>The workshop aims to challenge students and give those who are considering a career in medicine first-hand experience of a real operating theatre and they have been highly praised by professional staff at the NHS.</p>
      <p>Claire Smallwood, aged 25, who is studying for the Level 3 diploma in applied forensic science said: " The practical activities connected to the the biology side of the course and taking part in the event has given me a taster of what working in forensics will be like."</p>
      <p>The activities are all led by human anatomist Samuel Piri and his team of clinicians who recently featured on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den show.</p>
      <p>He said: "I personally write the academic content and produce all of the activities myself.</p>
      <p>"I and my team guarantee you a breath-taking, unforgettable trip through the human body like never before.</p>
      <p>"Each student will leave stretched and challenged having made measurable progress against the science specification, we've got them all covered."</p>
      <p>The in-depth sessions are aimed specifically at GCSE and A-Level students aged 14-19 or on access courses.</p>
