      <h1>Jamie Carragher calls for Everton to get to grips with their position</h1>

      <p>Jamie Carrahger believes that Everton need a major wake-up call about the position they find themselves in and feels it’s impossible for them to attract the elite managers in the business.</p>
      <p>Current Toffees boss Marco Silva is under-fire right now, as his team sit 16th in the Premier League table after 13 games.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside club are regressing during Silva’s second season in charge at Goodison Park and they are now entering a seriously tricky run of fixtures.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50562989">BBC Sport</a> have previously reported that Silva will remain in charge for the weekend’s clash against Leicester City, but that he’s fighting for his job and the club’s hierarchy have held talks about his position.</p>
      <p>Carragher has claimed that some Everton fans are unrealistic over what position the club finds itself and feels it’s a slow process to turn them into European regulars.</p>
      <p>“Everton fans will say the club ‘belongs’ where it was in the mid-80s, competing for major trophies when for a couple of years they were among the best in Europe. Sadly, beyond the walls of Goodison Park there are few who share this opinion. There is a clash between self-perception and reality,” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/29/everton-might-searching-new-manager-first-must-work-really/">Carragher wrote in the Telegraph.</a></p>
      <p>“Some Evertonians are living in a world where Farhad Moshiri should be trying to lure Mauricio Pochettino or Diego Simeone to Goodison. Everton operate in that market where their next manager can only be an up-and-coming young coach or an established name whose star has waned and is looking to demonstrate he can rekindle old glories.</p>
      <p>“Everton do not have a 21st century reputation to justify the more outlandish aims of their fans. Their board know it. Change can only come with steady improvement.</p>
      <p>“Before Everton can think about getting to where they want to be, they must accept and get to grips with escaping where they truly are.”</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>There will be a small group of Everton fans who do think with the mentality that Carragher refers to, but there are plenty that are far more realistic.</p>
      <p>The Toffees faithful are desperate for someone at the helm to try drive them towards the European spots and the fact of the matter is that Silva’s results haven’t been good enough on paper.</p>
      <p>Spurs are a brilliant recent example of how to go from a mid-table side to a top four regular and that was achieved over a number of years by their ex-manager Pochettino.</p>
      <p>It certainly doesn’t look like Silva is the long-term solution at Everton and it will be intriguing to see who replaces him if he exits.</p>
