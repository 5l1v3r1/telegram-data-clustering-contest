      <p>The whole <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here camp will take part in Friday night’s Bushtucker trial and it’s titled Sickening Circus.</p>
      <p>When the celebs think they are sitting down to watch a film named The Texas Brain-Saw Massacre, they know it’s not going to end well.</p>
      <p>The campmates have been divided into two groups and each team will battle it out against each other, starting with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a>.</p>
      <p>The ITV host and the Girls Aloud singer have to drink a pint of blended pig’s brain – and in a first look of the trial they were both dreading it.</p>
      <p>The duo had to down the drink as fast as they could – but they were competing against each other.</p>
      <p>Andy Whyment doesn’t help matters as he commented: ‘Looks like a strawberry milkshake.’</p>

      <p>Kate added: ‘Looks like a strawberry milkshake don’t think it’ll taste like a strawberry milkshake.’</p>

      <p>Kate joked: ‘I thought our first drink together would be so different.’</p>
      <p>The campmates applaud as they take the stand.</p>
      <p>In the trailer Kate looks like she means business as she tries to get the drink down as quickly as possible – but will they keep it down?</p>
