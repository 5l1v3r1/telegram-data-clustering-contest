      <p>KUANTAN: A road trip to Kuala Lumpur ended in tragedy for three friends when two of them were killed in an accident at KM86 of the Central Spine Road (CSR) near Lipis early this morning.</p>
      <p>The 4.45am incident saw the Perodua Viva they were in crashed into the rear of a lorry which was believed to have stopped on the emergency lane.</p>
      <p>Lipis police chief Superintendent Azli Mohd Noor said the victims were identified as Mohd Shaiful Abdul Manaf, 42, and Wan Khairul Anwar Wan Kamarunzaman, 32.</p>
      <p>"They were on their way to KL from Kelantan.</p>
      <p>"The driver, 39-year old Nukman Salleh, was believed to have dozed off before crashing into the back of the lorry, laden with used clothes, that was parked on the emergency lane.</p>
      <p>"Both Mohd Saiful, who was sitting at the front passenger seat, and Wan Khairul Anwar, who was sitting at the back, died on the spot due to head and body injuries," he said when contacted today.</p>
      <p>Azli said the lorry driver and conductor escaped unhurt.</p>
      <p>"The victims' bodies have been brought to Kuala Lipis Hospital for post-mortem before being released to the respective families," he said.</p>
      <p>Initial investigations, he said, found that the road was wet and foggy due to an earlier rainfall.</p>
      <p>The case is being investigated under Section 41(1) Road Transport Act 1987.</p>
