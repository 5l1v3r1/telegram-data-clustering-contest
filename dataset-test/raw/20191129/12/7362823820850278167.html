      <p>On Nov. 6, the “Aladdin” star uploaded a video of himself getting ready for his then-upcoming colonoscopy.</p>
      <p>"These are my little no-slip socks, that's my gown, it opens in the back," Smith said. "My a-- is gonna be out so they can get to it easy."</p>
      <p>He then cut to a shot of himself looking rather unhappy in a hospital gown.</p>
