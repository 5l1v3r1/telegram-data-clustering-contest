      <h1>Labour Making 'Pure Bermuda Triangle' Claims That NHS Can be Sold Off to the US, Boris Johnson Says</h1>

        <b>UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn previously revealed a 451-page packet of documents allegedly showing how the Conservatives had tried to "sell" the country's National Health Service (NHS) to US companies.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has responded to Labour's recent claims, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911271077419755-leaked-docs-obtained-by-labour-show-uk-has-been-in-talks-with-us-on-nhs-sale-for-2-years/">regarding the Tories' plans for the NHS</a>, by refuting the accusations and saying that the country's health service is "not for sale".</p>
      <blockquote>"Under no circumstances will this government or any Conservative government do anything to put the NHS up for negotiation in trade talks or privatising anything like that", Johnson said.</blockquote>
      <p>Johnson also slammed Labour's accusations of trying <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911271077418943-manual-therapy-nhs-advised-to-employ-masturbation-to-combat-stress-improve-mental-health/">to sell NHS</a> to American companies as "pure Bermuda Triangle" stuff.</p>
      <p>The prime minister also noted that London is currently holding trade talks with about a dozen countries adding that a number of deals are "oven ready". He failed to elaborate on exactly how many deals are ready to be signed.</p>
      <h3>New Brexit Day Promise</h3>
      <p>Addressing the question about breaking his pledge of getting the UK out of the EU by 31 October, the prime minister stated that he <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911231077384030-boris-johnson-roasts-corbyns-decision-to-be-neutral-in-absurd-new-brexit-vote/">had been ambushed in a "broken" Parliament</a> and thus could not fulfil his promise. Johnson then vowed that if his Conservative Party receives a majority in the upcoming elections, the UK will leave the European Union as soon as it can. The new deadline is 31 January 2020.</p>
      <p>When asked if he would prefer to keep the post of prime minister or to get the UK out of the EU, if such a choice existed, Johnson replied that he would prefer to get Brexit done.</p>
      <h4>Alleged Sale of NHS</h4>
      <p>Labour has long criticised the Tories and their plans for the UK's post-Brexit future by claiming they are trying to use the country's health service's privatisation as a bargaining chip in trade talks, specifically with the US.</p>

      <p>Their accusations recently received a new impulse when <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911271077418309-jeremy-corbyn-reveals-451-page-secret-tory-plan-to-sell-nhs-to-us/">Labour published a 451-page packet of purportedly leaked government documents</a>, showing that the Conservative Cabinet under Prime Minister Theresa May, Johnson's predecessor, had allegedly negotiated the "sale" of the NHS to the US.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed that Johnson tried to hide the fact that the government had been negotiating a "toxic" trade deal between July 2017 and July 2019 in which the US was "demanding" access to Britain’s NHS.</p>
