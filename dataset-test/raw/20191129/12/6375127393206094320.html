      <h3>FOR failing to present new arguments, the motion for reconsideration filed by the government in connection with the dismissal of the case against Marcoses and Tantocos was dismissed by the Sandiganbayan.</h3>
      <p>The Presidential Commission on Good Government, in its motion, asked the graft court to overturn the dismissal of a P1-billion civil case against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, his wife former Governor Imelda Marcos, and their alleged dummies, Rustan’s Commercial Corporation founders Bienvenido Tantoco Sr. and Gliceria Tantoco.</p>
      <p>According to the PCGG, the defendants admitted material allegations pertaining to the ill-gotten nature of Tourist Duty Free Shops assets.</p>
      <p>likewise asserted that the Tantocos “indeed acted as dummies and agents of the Marcoses in acquiring ill-gotten wealth.”</p>
      <p>But the Sandiganbayan 2nd Division denied the PCGG’s appeal for lack of merit due to failure to present new arguments.</p>
      <p>“The arguments raised therein have already been judiciously passed upon and properly considered by the court in the assailed decision which states that the documentary and testimonial evidence presented by the plaintiff are insufficient to prove the allegations in the expanded complaint,” the court said in a resolution.</p>
      <p>The Sandiganbayan had dismissed the case against the late President and Rustan’s Commercial Corporation founders Bienvenido Tantoco and wife Gliceria involving P1.052 billion ill-gotten wealth due to insufficiency of evidence.</p>
      <p>In its latest ruling, the anti-graft court pointed out a Supreme Court ruling that states “a motion for reconsideration should be denied when the same only rehashes issues previously put forward.”<br/>     case against the Marcoses and Tantocos include the expensive art and jewelry, real estate properties in New York, duty-free shop franchises, tax-free importation benefits, corporations such as Rustan International Marketing, Eagle Mining Corporation, Rustan Pulp and Paper Factory.</p>
      <p>The case also included properties in Hawaii in the United States, Rome, Italy, and Forbes Park in Makati City in an expanded complaint against the defendants as well as other personal properties such as motor vehicles, cash on hand and in bank, notes, loans, and 3 Cessna aircraft.</p>
