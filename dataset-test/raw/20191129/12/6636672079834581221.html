      <p><b>5.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/osat-market-may-turn-2019-11/">OSAT market may be on the turn</a><br/>The decline in the outsourced assembly and test (OSAT) industry showed signs of a gradual halt in 3Q19, says TrendForce, since the drop in memory prices began to slow down, and smartphone sales steadily recovered. The top ten OSAT providers posted a total revenue of $6 billion in 3Q19, a 10.1% growth YoY and 18.7% growth QoQ, indicating that the market as a whole is on its way to recovery.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/panasonic-quits-chips-2019-11/">Panasonic quits chips</a><br/>After 67 years Matsushita/Panasonic is quitting the chip industry. Between 1985 and 1990 the company was a top ten player. Now it is to be sold to Nuvoton Technology of Taiwan which is 61% owned by Winbond. Nuvoton is paying $250 million for the unit which designs power-management chips and sensors for smartphones, cars and security cameras. For its FY ending in March, Panasonic Semiconductor made a loss of $215m on sales of $840m.</p>

      <p><b>3.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/intel-said-looking-sell-home-connectivity-unit-2019-11/">Intel looking to sell home connectivity unit</a><br/>Intel has hired a financial company to find a buyer for its home connectivity group, reports Bloomberg. The group makes chips for home gateways and routers where it competes with Qualcomm and Broadcom. Sales of the group are said to be about $450 million annually. Intel has been in and out of many attempted diversifications: watches, mobile APs, PLDs, ASICs, XScale, LCOS, WiMAX, CLECs, VOIP, STB, wearables, AR glasses and, now, home connectivity.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/risc-v-foundation-moves-switzerland-2019-11/">RISC-V Foundation moves to Switzerland</a><br/>The four year-old RISC-V Foundation is moving from Delaware to Switzerland to allay foreign members’ fears of possible disruption to their continued development of the open-source technology. Although the non-profit foundation does not own the technology, Calista Redmond the foundation’s chief executive, says foreign members of the foundation have said they’d be ‘more comfortable’ if the foundation was not incorporated in the US.</p>
