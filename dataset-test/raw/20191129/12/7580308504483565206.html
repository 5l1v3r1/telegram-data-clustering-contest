      <p>From his sprawling 4000 plus acres ranch in Wyoming, Kanye West serves the video for “Closed On Sunday”, the second video from ‘Jesus is King” album.</p>
      <p>The music video opens alongside Kim Kardashian and their kids North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm, sitting in the cleft of a rock.</p>
      <p>Kourtney and Kris are not also left out in this video, seems like a family reunion.</p>
      <p>Kanye brings out his Sunday Service Choir, they surround him as he stands on higher ground in the middle of the crowd.</p>
      <p>There are some very dramatic and beautiful visuals of the rugged Wyoming landscape-mountains, rocky terrain, grass-covered plains, and ATVs barreling through the expanse of land.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Kanye and Kim were scolded by Wyoming authorities earlier this year after Kim posted a video that appeared to show Kanye taking the couple on an ATV ride across the range, chasing some pronghorns.</p>
      <p>Jesus Is King is the ninth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on October 25, 2019.</p>
      <p>The album follows a Christian theme, with West describing it as “an expression of the gospel.” West had formed his Sunday Service group in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from his discography.</p>
      <p>Sunday Service performed the songs “Water” and “Everything We Need” live prior to release.</p>
