      <p>Costco is extending its Thanksgiving day online promotions to customers in the US after its website crashed for several hours and shoppers were unable to shop the sales.</p>
      <p>Reports of its site issues first surfaced on Twitter on Thursday morning. By mid-morning, the retailer, whose stores were closed in the US over Thanksgiving Day, added a banner to its website warning online shoppers that the site is “experiencing slow response times.”</p>
      <p>An updated banner now informs shoppers that the sales have now been extended throughout Black Friday, “while supplies last.”</p>
      <p>Costco runs early online promotions from Thanksgiving day, ahead of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>It is not yet clear how much these website outages might have cost Costco. A spokesperson for the company was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.</p>
      <p>But it’s clear that a good chunk of people was impacted by the outage, judging by the flurry of complaints that cropped up on Twitter throughout the day:</p>
