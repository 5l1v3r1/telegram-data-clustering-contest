        <b>Tonto Dikeh, Nollywood actress, says her mistakes in the past have helped her become the “man” she is today.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The controversial actress took to her social media page to disclose this on Friday.</p>
      <p>In what seemed like a morning reflection of her life so far, the actress said her challenges and mistakes experienced in the past have been her greatest strength as they have helped make her stronger.</p>
      <p>“I’m thankful for all my mistakes/failures. They are the evidence that proves I tried. I’ve learned more from failure than I have succeeded. It’s the training ground that’s preparing me for where I’m going. I no longer fear it. Instead, it gets me closer to the goal. Without it, I wouldn’t be the MAN I am today,” she wrote on her Instagram page.</p>
