      <h1>2Face singing my song without permission doesn’t make him a thief —Blackface</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:14:07+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Oluwakemi Abimbola</a></address>
      <p>Nigerian singer, Augustine Ahmedu, also known as Blackface has said that lawyers have made him realise that because his former bandmate, Innocent Idibia, popularly known as 2Face and his manager, Efe Omorogbe, allegedly used his song without his permission doesn’t make them thieves.</p>
      <p>On his official Instagram page, Blackface revealed that the duo of 2Face and Efe had withdrawn the defamation suit against him and he had apologised to them.</p>
      <p>He said that he made the claim in order to fight for his rights and also motivate some other persons not to “sleep on their rights.”</p>
      <p>He said, “I’m a human being and a Nigerian who fights for his rights. The problem with many of us is that we are afraid to speak up for what is right or defend the truth when we know it. No be say I too talk my people but I’m just trying to inspire somebody. My people “Don’t sleep on your rights” and users of peoples works make sure the writers/contributors are credited properly.</p>
      <p>“When you speak out, things happen and that’s why I said I will be done with this issue this year 2019 and behold here we are…I can say that the 50 million defamation suit filed against me by Mr Innocent Idibia aka 2face and his manager, Mr Efe Omorogbe has been settled out of court as they both have withdrawn their case filed against me</p>
      <p>“It’s true that they sang my song without permission and truly it pissed me off, but that doesn’t legally make them thieves as the lawyers made me understand</p>
      <p>“Sometimes the words we use matter, that’s why I apologised for using that word when my lawyers advised me.</p>
      <p>“Finally, they admitted they made mistakes with my songwriters and publishers rights which they should have informed me before but they never did, they have promised to rectify them so we wait and I hope they honour this time and furnish me details to that effect (sic).”</p>
