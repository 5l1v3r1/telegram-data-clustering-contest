      <h1>Cryptocurrency exchange IDAX’s CEO reportedly missing with the company’s cold wallet</h1>
      <h2>No one knows where they went</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:18:14+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:18</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Beedham</a></address>
      <p>A relatively small cryptocurrency exchange has halted deposit and withdrawal services after its CEO has reportedly gone missing.</p>
      <p>The IDAX exchange <a href="https://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037327571-Urgent-announcement-about-current-situation-of-IDAX-Global">posted an announcement</a> earlier today saying it had halted some operations after its staff were unable to make contact with the global CEO.</p>
      <p>The CEO is said to have taken access to the company’s cold wallets with them. At this point, it’s not known why the CEO has supposedly vanished.</p>
      <p>According to CoinMarketCap, IDAX serviced some $500 million worth of Bitcoin trades over the past 24 hours — compared to top ranking exchange BitMEX, which serviced over $2 billion. (These are reported figures, so bear that in mind and exercise caution.)</p>
      <p>IDAX says it’s still trying to get a hold of the situation and understand what is going on.</p>
      <p>The cryptocurrency exchange says it’s drawing up an emergency plan.</p>
      <p>It has advised all users to refrain from using its platform and services for the time being.</p>
      <p>IDAX hasn’t stated the value of cryptocurrency held in its cold wallets. However, the announcement did say that the cold wallets stored “almost all cryptocurrency balances on IDAX [which] have been restricted.”</p>
      <p>No timeline has been given in regard to the emergency plan or when services can expect to be back online.</p>
      <p>This is a developing story.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/02/08/a-primer-on-quadrigacx-the-curious-134m-cryptocurrency-mystery/">Gerald Cotten the CEO</a> of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX reportedly passed away taking the company‘s private keys and $134 million worth of cryptocurrency with him.</p>
