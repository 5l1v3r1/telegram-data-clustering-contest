      <p>Workwise, Deepika is awaiting the release of Meghna Gulzar’s <i>Chhapaak</i>, which is based on the journey of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal. The film also stars Vikrant Massey and is all set to hit the theatres on January 10. Chhapaak also marks Deepika’s debut as a producer.</p>
      <p>At an event last month, Deepika was quoted by PTI saying that Chhapaak was a draining experience for her. “The process was exhausting. We had to get the prosthetics done for like three hours and another hour to take it off. Emotionally, I have never been as burnt out as I felt after that,” she had said.</p>
      <p>Apart from Chhapaak, the actress will be also be seen in Ranveer Singh starrer<i> ’83</i>. She will essay the role of Rumi Dev, Kapil Dev’s wife in the film.</p>
