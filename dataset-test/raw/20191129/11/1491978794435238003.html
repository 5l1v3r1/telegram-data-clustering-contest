        <b>My husband’s ex-girlfriend is still obsessed with him. My mother-in-law </b>
        <b>remains on good terms with her and is currently letting her stay at her house. My husband cheated on me with her and I forgave him. Now, when he visits his mum, he doesn’t take me with him while his ex is there, even though he agreed that he wouldn’t see her again. I don’t know what to do or how to cope with this.</b>
