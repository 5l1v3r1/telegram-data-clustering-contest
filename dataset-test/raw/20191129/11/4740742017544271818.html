      <h1>Heartfelt tribute to St Paul's community leader with "great humour" who spent his life helping others</h1>
      <h2>“He was someone who worked tirelessly for improved opportunities and quality of life in our neighbourhood.”</h2>

      <p>Heartbroken family and friends have paid tribute to a “good man”, who always fought for his community while keeping his mischievous streak.</p>
      <p>Pete Bullard passed away at the BRI on October 31 at age 72, as a result of an illness.</p>
      <p>Having moved to Bristol from Cornwall in the 1980s, he lived in St Agnes and then <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/st-pauls">St Paul's</a> eventually becoming the Chair of the St Paul's Planning Group.</p>
      <p>He first became involved with the community when <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/cabot-circus">Cabot Circus</a> was first proposed, as people wanted to coordinate neighbourhood responses to ensure they had an input into the development. </p>
      <p>Plans were also being formed for St Agnes Lodge as a community asset which led to the formation of St Pauls Unlimited and Pete remained at the core of it from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>In a statement, his wife Michele describes early memories with him and said: “In his youth, Pete looked a lot like Cat Stevens (but did not have the same musical talent); we went to a restaurant in Newquay one day with some friends and the waitress actually thought he was Cat Stevens and in consequence knocked a bit off the bill making a very gleeful and smug Pete.”</p>
      <p>Not only was Pete a pillar of the community,  but he was also an artist, a photographer, a stained glass maker and teacher. </p>
      <p>He ran classes at St Paul's Learning Centre for anyone who wanted to learn how to create with glass.</p>

      <p>His college, Lori Streich said: “Pete started campaigning for the redevelopment of Westmoreland House, the Carriageworks site, in 2002 and remained involved with this until his death. </p>
      <p>“Carriageworks Action Group meetings in the future will miss his input and his wisdom - and sometimes his mischief – and members of the Carriageworks Action Group are ever more determined to see the development through as a way to remember and honour him.”</p>
      <p>When news of his death was announced on the Carriageworks Action Group’s website, one person wrote: “He was a good man; he is going to be missed.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “He was someone who worked tirelessly for improved opportunities and quality of life in our neighbourhood. Fruiting trees will be a fitting tribute to his creative brand of community development.”</p>
      <p>Two council officers who worked with Pete wrote they had “many an extra hour after a community meeting with Pete.”</p>
      <p>“He was always a fantastic advocate for his community and I always loved the way he held us ‘council lot’ to account in meetings and kept us on our toes with no nonsense but also with great humour.”</p>
      <p>Members of the Carriageworks Action Group have set up a Just Giving Page to enable the planting and maintenance of sweet chestnut and greengage trees in St Paul's to remember Pete’s contribution to his community and environment. </p>
      <p>Lori said: “We chose these because Pete always said that all trees planted in St Pauls should bear fruit for local people to enjoy.”</p>
      <p>The Celebration of Pete’s Life will be held from 1pm - 5pm at St Pauls Learning Centre on December 2nd. Those who knew Pete are welcomed by those close to him to come and join them in sharing memories.</p>
      <p>Some of his art work will be on display at St Pauls Learning Centre after the service.</p>
