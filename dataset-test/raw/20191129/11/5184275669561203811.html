      <p>Bigg Boss 13 might have started on a low note with the makers continuously reminding contestants that they haven’t come on a vacation, but the graph is now topic charts with massive TRPs. Housemates starting from Sidharth Shukla, Rashami Desai, to Mahira Sharma have up their game, and there’s controversy taking place every other day. Now, Shehnaaz Gill has accused Hindustani Bhau of touching her inappropriately! Here’s what happened next.</p>
      <p>During a recent luxury budget task, when Hindustani Bhau was trying to snatch the required objects from Sidharth Shukla, Shehnaaz Gill comes in front to protect him. Bhau tries to move the Punjabi singer by poking her, and that’s when the entire issue begins.</p>

      <p>Shehnaaz accuses Hindustani Bhau of touching her in a wrong manner, and while he tries to explain his side, Rashami Desai comes to his rescue. Furthermore, while Mahira Gill further exaggerated the situation, Sidharth Shukla instead fought with Rashami for getting into their fight. The entire issue turns bigger with all the housemates getting involved.</p>
      <p>Even Colors’ official Twitter handle excited the fans about the entire row as they wrote, “<br/>#HindustaniBhau aur #ShehnaazGill ke jhagde mein ladh rahe hai @sidharth_shukla aur @TheRashamiDesai!”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Hindustani Bhau’s (Vikas Fhatak) wife Ashwini had recently submitted a written complaint in Khar Police Station here regarding incorrect statements made against him on social media.</p>
      <p>The handwritten letter dated November 24 reads that “many incorrect and fake messages, statements, videos are made against Hindustani Bhau. People are addressing themselves as family members, mentioning themselves as brothers, aunt, are no one to him. Our family includes my mother-in-law, my son, my mother, father, Hindustani Bhau’s nephew Sandesh”.</p>
      <p>Ashwini also requested the media to not take interviews of the “fake relatives and not to upload wrong videos and messages against Vikas Fhatak which will create controversies”.</p>
