      <p>THQ Nordi has released a new trailer looking at the second Horseman that will star in upcoming dungeon crawler <i>Darksiders: Genesis</i>. And it ain't Tully Blanchard, it's the rider of the White Horse himself, Strife.<br/><br/>Strife is the only member of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse yet to receive their own <i>Darksiders</i> adventure. As such, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../darksiders-genesis-trailer-shows-us-exactly-what-war-huh-is-good-for-566045.phtml">his inclusion as the co-protagonist of <i>Darksiders: Genesis</i></a> is a big deal for fans. Adept with firearms - with an equally quick-fire tongue to match - Strife is perhaps the most irreverent, even laid-back, member of the Horsemen, carrying the keen eyes and casual wit of an old gunslinger.<br/><br/>Set before the original<i> Darksiders</i> game, Genesis will allow one or two players to don the respective mantles of Strife and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../darksiders-genesis-trailer-shows-us-exactly-what-war-huh-is-good-for-566045.phtml">War</a>, guiding the pair deep into the underworld on an assignment to track down Lucifer himself, currently upsetting "The Balance" by amassing his own demonic army for unknown, bur seemingly nefarious, reasons.</p>
