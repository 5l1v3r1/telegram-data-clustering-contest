      <p>Nearly 200 Bills fans ended their Thanksgiving at the airport to greet the team upon its arrival from Texas following a 26-15 victory against the Cowboys.</p>
      <p>The team's plane landed shortly after 12:30 a.m., and the scene was reminiscent of the Bills being greeted at the airport on New Year's Eve in 2017 hours after they made the playoffs to break the drought.</p>
      <p>"Happy Thanksgiving to everyone back there in Buffalo," coach Sean McDermott had said during his postgame press conference. "It's an incredible pace to live ... and be part of the Bills."</p>
      <p>The Bills had a strong contingent of fans in Dallas following on big crowds in Nashville, Miami and Cleveland this season.</p>
