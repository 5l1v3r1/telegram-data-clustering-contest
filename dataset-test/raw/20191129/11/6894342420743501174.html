      <h1>Android 10 Updates Are Rolling Out To Samsung Galaxy S10 Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:33:21+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/bryanlim/" target="_blank">Bryan Lim</a></address>
      <p>Samsung’s OneUI 2.0 interface based on the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/192309/android-q-is-now-android-10-no-more-dessert-names/">Android 10</a> system was previously released a while back for a limited beta test for their smartphones. The korean smartphone maker has recently confirmed in a news release that the stable version of the system will be finally making its way to the Galaxy S10 series. Currently, the update has only been pushed out for the German region, with more to arrive in other regions soon after.</p>
      <p>Based on the information that we received from our own test units which received the Android 10 upgrade, the update was rolled out on 28 November and is almost 2GB in file size. Other than new features and tweaks to existing apps, it also comes with the December security update.</p>
      <p>Some new features in this update include new gesture controls for Full Screen Navigation, and the new Live Captions feature where any video, podcast, or audio message that you’re playing on your phone can be automatically captioned for reading.</p>

      <p>Samsung also added a feature where the phone’s fingerprint sensor icon is still shown on screen even when it is locked. This setting can be customised via the Always On Display menu. A minute, but welcomed addition.</p>
      <p>Other than that, the phone’s battery usage graph has also been changed to provide better insights, and the “My Files” file directory app now comes with a Trash feature, where you could restore files if you’ve mistakenly deleted them. Lastly, phone-to-car application Android Auto is also included in the update.</p>
