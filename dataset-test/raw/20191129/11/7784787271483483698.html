      <h3>Australia vs Pakistan day/night, second Test at Adelaide Oval, every ball live and ad free on Fox Cricket 501 from 1.30pm AEDT.</h3>
      <p>They say when it rains, it pours – and that’s certainly proving to be the case for Australia’s rising star Marnus Labuschagne.</p>
      <p>The plucky right-hander took 10 Tests and five half-centuries before he could break through the barrier and score his maiden Test ton.</p>

      <p>Now in the space of two innings, Labuschagne has two centuries and has overtaken Steve Smith as Australia’s highest scorer for 2019.</p>
      <p>His latest century came under the Adelaide Oval lights on Friday night as he expertly sent the pink ball to all corners of the ground and left Pakistan scrambling for answers.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne brought up his century off 169 balls before giving the Australian changeroom a mighty fist pump and his batting partner, David Warner, a hug.</p>

      <p>The 25-year-old was on the fringes of Australia’s Test side at the Ashes, where he was only called up as a concussion substitute for Smith.</p>
      <p>Since then, he’s followed the example of the run machine by making two centuries and four fifties in nine Test innings.</p>
      <p>“His rapid rise to the player he is today compared to last year has been amazing,” Australia legend Mark Waugh said in commentary for Fox Cricket.</p>
      <p>“Unbelievable isn’t it?” another legend, Shane Warne said. “When we saw him in January we said ‘geez, he’s got a bit of work to do’. His head fell over, he fell across the ball, and his technique was different.</p>
      <p>“But since that match at Lord’s when he came in as a replacement for Steve Smith, I tell you what, he’s looked as good as anyone playing the modern game.”</p>
      <p>Waugh added: “He made a lot of tough runs in the Ashes against quality bowling. He’s cashing in at the moment. You know he can do it the tough way but he can expand his shots as well.”</p>
