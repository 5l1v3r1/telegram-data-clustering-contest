      <p>The <b>Taliban</b> said today they are ready to resume <b>peace talks</b> with theUS - a day after President <b>Donald Trump</b>'s surprise visit to US troops in Afghanistan, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>Trump has announced that <b>peace talks</b> with hardline Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan will resume.</p>
      <p>“The <b>Taliban</b> wants to make a deal and we’re meeting with them and we’re saying it has to be a cease-fire and they didn’t want to do a cease-fire and now they do want to do a cease-fire,” Trump said during a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani at Bagram Air Field.</p>
      <p>“I believe it probably will work out that way, and we'll see what happens,” he added.</p>
      <p><b>Taliban</b> spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said today that they are "ready to resume talks" that have failed since Trump terminated them earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"Our stance is still the same. If <b>peace talks</b> start, it will be resumed from the stage where it had stopped," Mujahid told Reuters.</p>
      <p>"We are hoping that Trump’s visit to Afghanistan will prove that he is serious to start talks again. We don’t think he has not much of a choice," said a senior <b>Taliban</b> commander on conditions of anonymity, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>Earlier, representatives of the <b>Taliban</b> leadership told Reuters that since the end of last week, the group has been negotiating in Doha with senior US officials and that the <b>peace talks</b> could soon be resumed officially.</p>
      <p>Trump's surprise visit to Afghanistan was his first since becoming president, and took place a week after the exchange of captives between Washington and the <b>Taliban</b>, which raised hopes that an agreement could be reached to end the war, Reuters notes.</p>
