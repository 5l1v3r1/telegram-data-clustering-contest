      <p>NOBHEKIMPILO Mbovora, popularly known as Vivica, has opened up on her controversial dressing which sparked a social media frenzy recently after she turned up in a risque outfit for a lecture at the National University of Science and Technology (Nust).</p>
      <p>Vivica <a href="https://www.bmetro.co.zw/video-nust-nudist-speaks-my-style-is-communicating-a-message-to-all-ladies-out-there-abused-by-men/">said she pulled the act  to fight for women’s rights.</a></p>
      <aside>“Women in my hood are raped and abused by men but in the name of <i>umendo</i> (marriage), they’d rather suffer in pain and I’m here to speak out against such abuse.</aside>
      <p>Vivica revealed that she was a feminist, determined to stand for all women who are deprived of their rights and she was determined to achieve her dream through modelling.</p>
      <aside>“Men shouldn’t be affected by how we dress, if it was a man half-naked, it wouldn’t be an issue but just because I am a woman, it becomes an issue, it’s high time the society stops treating women as possessions,” said Vivica, who was dressed in a bum short.</aside>
      <p><a href="http://harare.com/watch-hezvo-slay-queen-brings-varsity-to-a-standstill-in-nude-outfit/">Vivica’s pictures and videos which went viral on social media</a> made her a target of verbal abuse as people in her class called her names.</p>
