      <p>Last week, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation revealed the updated 2020 Mirage, and its sedan counterpart, the 2020 Mirage G4 (Attrage in Thailand). Through numerous press photos, we got to see the new design of Mitsubishi’s popular hatchback and sedan from various angles. But, it’s only in person can we say that the new Mirage and Mirage G4 look really good.</p>

      <p>With the 2019 Thailand International Motor Expo in full swing, we got to see the 2020 Mirage and Mirage G4 in the metal. Despite the radical makeover, it still rides on the same platform which has been in use since 2012 (2013 for the sedan). As mentioned previously, the Mirage now features Mitsubishi’s Dynamic Shield design language upfront. As a result, it borrows styling elements from the Xpander, Montero Sport, and the Strada.</p>

      <p>Both the sedan and hatchback now feature new, longer headlights that seem connected to the large front grill. Speaking of, the grill appears to be lifted directly from Mitsubishi’s current model and runs from the headlights all the way to the bumper apron. Noticeably, the hood and fenders have also been tweaked as part of the 2020 update.</p>

      <p>At the rear, the styling changes are subtler on both the Mirage hatchback and Mirage G4 sedan. You can still easily recognize the design as the trunk lid on the G4 and tailgate of the Mirage have the same look. Most of the changes have been applied to the rear bumper and the taillights.</p>
      <p>Inside, the cabin design has been largely carried over such as the dashboard, door panels and air-conditioning vents. High-end variants can still come with automatic climate control while new seat patterns freshen up the interior. The touchscreen audio system now comes with Apple CarPlay as well. However, do expect this to vary from country to country.</p>
      <p>Aside from the interior, the 1.2-liter three-cylinder MIVEC engine under the hood has also been carried over. Power is retained at 78 PS and 100 Nm of torque and shifts via a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT).</p>

      <p>Expect the Philippine market to get the updated Mirage and Mirage G4 as well. However, there is still no timeline yet as to when.</p>
