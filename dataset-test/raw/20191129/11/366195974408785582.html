      <p>The year is nearing a close, but the albums keep on coming. In fact, today has been the most fruitful day in a minute, bringing a wealth of new projects into the fold. For one, we've got releases from The Game, with his final album <i>Born 2 Rap; </i>features from Nipsey Hussle, 21 Savage, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Miguel/profile">Miguel</a>, Ed Sheeran, and many more line that stacked affair. Griselda, the trifecta made up of Buffalo's Westside Gunn, Conway, and Benny The Butcher, lined up their Shady Records debut <i>WWCGD, </i>or <i>What Would Chine Gun Do? </i>The project features appearances from Raekwon, Eminem, and 50 Cent (who delivers a standout verse on "City On The Map).</p>

      <p>Esteemed lyricist <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Fabolous/profile">Fabolous</a> also came through with a new release, rounding out his trilogy with <i>Summertime Shootout 3; </i>that one includes verses from Meek Mill, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lildurk/profile">Lil Durk</a>, A Boogie, Roddy Rich, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ChrisBrown/profile">Chris Brown</a>, and more. Blac Youngsta took a break from flexing to line up <i>Church On Sunday, </i>featuring T.I., <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Da-Baby/profile/">DaBaby</a>, Tory Lanez, and more. And if that wasn't enough, the ever-prolific Curren$y linked up with Smoke DZA for <i>Prestige Worldwide, </i>featuring the Beloved brothers Dave East and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/StylesP/profile">Styles P</a>.</p>
      <p>A stacked lineup indeed, and one that demands no shortage of time and attention. But when all is said and done, there can only be one that reigns supreme.
