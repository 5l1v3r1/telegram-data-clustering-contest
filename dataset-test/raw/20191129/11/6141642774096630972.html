      <p>Former Arsenal striker John Hartson says Unai Emery “had to go” but has criticised the Gunners’ new interim head coach Freddie Ljungberg.</p>
      <p>Emery was sacked by the north London club on Friday morning after a Europa League defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt extended the team’s winless run to seven matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Hartson, who played for Arsenal between 1995 and 1997 and now works as a pundit, supported the decision to dismiss the Spaniard, but questioned Ljungberg’s contribution against Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Ex-Gunners midfielder Ljungberg had been working as assistant first-team coach under Emery this season after being promoted during the summer.</p>
      <p>“Ljungberg was a great help to Emery last night.. sat down for 90 mins..” Hartson tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Surely you get in the manager’s ear if you can see what’s going wrong.. Emery had to go.”</p>
      <p>After being chosen in May 2018 as the man to follow Arsene Wenger’s 22-year reign, Emery missed out on Champions League qualification in his first season having finished fifth in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are currently eighth in the top flight following just four wins from 13 matches ahead of Sunday’s match at Norwich.</p>
      <p>Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who played in Emery’s final game, apologised and said the players must take responsibility for recent poor results.</p>
      <p>“Thank you @UnaiEmery_ and Javi (Garcia, goalkeeping coach) I’m sorry we let you down, it’s our fault for not performing the right way, I’m sure we will meet again,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal youth player Fabrice Muamba was not surprised to see the club make a managerial change, tweeting: “Result business.”</p>
