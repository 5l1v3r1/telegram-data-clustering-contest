      <p>Nadine Coyle and Kate Garraway are terrorised by a chainsaw killer in tonight's Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Every single one of the celebrities take part in the Sickening Circus as part of the massive 'Reckoning' task.</p>
      <p>The campmates are split into two teams, those who are cursed and those who aren't, and forced to compete against one another.</p>
      <p>They sit down in a make-shift jungle cinema to watch some films - but obviously it's not that easy with Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly involved.</p>
      <p>First up is Nadine and Kate, who have a horrified look on their faces when they see the film is 'The Texas Brain-Saw Massacre'.</p>

      <p>A ranger wearing a scary mask from the terrifying horror film then emerged with two disgusting drinks.</p>
      <p>Former footballer Ian Wright admits it's a "nice effect", while <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Andy Whyment claims it looks like a "strawberry milkshake".</p>
      <p>Getting her composure back, smiling Nadine turns to the Good Morning Britain host and says: "Looks lovely, Kate."</p>

      <p>Kate confesses: "Looks like a strawberry milkshake. I don't think it's going to taste like one."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb host Ant reveals that the drinks they will have to down are blended pigs' brains.</p>
      <p>The girls nervously walk up to the front as comforting Caitlyn Jenner cries: "Just finish them girls. Don't worry about ti just finish them."</p>

      <p>Kate jokes: "I thought our first drink together would be so different."</p>
      <p>While the Girls aloud singer adds: "Hope our second drink is better."</p>
      <p>The race to finish the vile concoction begins on the klaxon - and Kate gives a steely gaze as she struggles to swallow the brains.</p>
      <p>Who will win out of Kate and Nadine?</p>
