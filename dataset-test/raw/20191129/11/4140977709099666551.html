          </p>
          <p>During the first day of the second Test of the ongoing Pakistan’s tour of Australia in Adelaide, Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi put on display a couple of shambolic fielding efforts to gift as many as eight runs to Australia opening batsman David Warner.</p>
          <p>While Afridi <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/watch-shaheen-afridi-misjudges-ball-to-leak-four-runs-in-adelaide-test/">erred firstly in the 42nd over</a> of the Australian innings, the 19-year old cricketer was at fault again on the first delivery of the 58th over.</p>

                      <p>After Australia captain Tim Paine won the toss and chose to bat, Australia dominated the visitors yet again. Despite Afridi sending back Australia opening batsman Joe Burns (4) in the fourth over, there wasn’t any additional relief for Pakistan.</p>
                      <p>Both Warner and all-rounder Marnus Labuschagne have scored individual hundreds in a second-wicket partnership which has crossed the 250-run mark at the time of writing this article.</p>

                          <p>It is worth mentioning the ongoing match is being played with the pink ball under lights. It was back in 2015 that the first day-night Test match was played at the same venue. While this is Australia sixth home day-night Test, it is the fourth one in Adelaide.</p>
