        <b>RANGERS could face having Ibrox closed for their next Europa League match against Young Boys if Uefa take action following reports of sectarian singing against Feyenoord.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5008446/rangers-fc-transfer-news-morelos-keown/">Gers</a> have already been ordered by Uefa to close sections of the stadium on two occasions this season - for the visits of Legia Warsaw and Feyenoord.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> also declined to take any away tickets for the trip to face Young Boys at the start of October.</p>
      <p>Now, under Uefa's strict Article 14 rules on racism and other discriminatory conduct, they could be ordered to close the entire stadium for the final group game against Young Boys on December 12.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-provide-thrills-pitch-ftp-20984936">Daily Record</a> reports that Gers fans in the De Kuip stadium sung the Neil Diamond song 'Sweet Caroline' with the add-on 'F*** the Pope'.</p>
      <p>And The Athletic's Rangers correspondent <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanc1107?lang=en">Jordan Campbell reported on Twitter</a> that he heard offensive songs that could lead to a stadium closure.</p>
      <p>He said: "If Ibrox is shut for the Young Boys game for a couple of the songs sung tonight then the fans who are guilty can have no complaints.</p>
      <p>"The club did everything they could but still some idiots seem intent on singing it.</p>
      <p>"FARE send a rep to every Rangers game in Europe. You may think that is a form of targeting but they are applying the rules.</p>
      <p>"A third rule break sees Ibrox shut. It was black and white. If you refuse to acknowledge it then it will never change."</p>
      <p>After taking stick from some Gers supporters for highlighting the issue, Campbell said: "Look, I realise some fans are always going to say I’m anti-Rangers purely because I’m a journalist.</p>
      <p>"That’s nonsense to anyone who knows me so I’m not going to reply anymore to the DMs etc. Pointless."</p>

      <p>Referring to repeated racist behaviour, Uefa's Article 14 says: "The following disciplinary measures apply in the event of recidivism: a. a second offence is punished with one match played behind closed doors and a fine of €50,000;b. any subsequent offence is punished with more than one match behind closed doors, a stadium closure, the forfeiting of a match, the deduction of points and/or disqualification from the competition.</p>
      <p>"If the circumstances of the case require it, the competent disciplinary body may impose additional disciplinary measures on the member association or club responsible, such as the playing of one or more matches behind closed doors, a stadium closure, the forfeiting of a match, the deduction of points and/or disqualification from the competition."</p>
      <p>Anti-racism group FARE (Football Against Racism in Europe) work alongside Uefa and send a delegate to every Rangers European game because of past offences.</p>
      <p>Now the Ibrox club must sweat on whether FARE or the Uefa delegate at the game has officially recorded any sectarian chanting.</p>
      <p>After Rangers were hit with their first partial closure due to offensive chanting in the Europa League qualifier against St Joseph's, the club released a statement condemning the fans who refuse to stop the sectarian chants.</p>
      <p>The statement said: "Our supporters have been asked repeatedly by the club to refrain from indulging in this, and other forms of unacceptable behaviour.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, the warnings have fallen on deaf ears and the actions of this minority will cause the club and the majority of good and decent Rangers supporters to pay a heavy penalty.</p>
      <p>"If any individual supporter is unable to behave in a civilised manner then please stay away from Ibrox and our club.</p>
      <p>"You are harming Rangers and that is something a genuine supporter would never wish to do."</p>
      <p>In August Rangers launched the 'Everyone Anyone' campaign in a bid to stamp out sectarianism which was backed by chairman Dave King and manager Steven Gerrard.</p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> has asked Rangers and Uefa for comment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5007741/feyenoord-2-rangers-2-europa-league/">Alfredo Morelos scored a double in last night's 2-2 draw with Feyenoord</a> as Gerrard's men took a step closer to the Europa League last 32.</p>
      <p>A win in their last game against Young Boys guarantees they win Group G while a draw will ensure European football beyond Christmas.</p>
