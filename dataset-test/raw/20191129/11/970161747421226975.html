      <p>The prime minister was seen making a menacing cut-throat gesture while being quizzed on social care plans in an interview with LBC.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> responded to caller’s questions on the radio this morning, speaking about the NHS, trade talks with the US and his<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/29/boris-johnson-refuses-say-many-children-11238199/"> silence on speaking about his own children.</a></p>
      <p>But some viewers picked up on a moment in the middle of his interview with host Nick Ferrari, when the PM appeared to draw his finger across his throat.</p>
      <p>It looked as though the PM was aggressively signalling he wanted to cut the interview and stop taking questions from the public.</p>

      <p>Some speculated whether he forgot the radio broadcast was being filmed and streamed live online.</p>
      <p>However, the prime minister claimed he was actually mimicking Mr Ferrari, saying it was the presenter who made the gesture, because a producer was talking to him in his headphones too loudly.</p>
      <p>This was later backed up by the host, who tweeted: ‘To clarify the PM’s gesture this morning on LBC, this is sign language between me and my producer to signify he needs to stay quiet in my ear.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been in common use for over 10 years. End of.’</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in his LBC interview, Mr Johnson spoke about allegations he wanted to ‘sell off’ the NHS to the US in post-Brexit trade talks.</p>
      <p>He said he would ‘walk out’ of talks with President Donald Trump if the US demanded the NHS be ‘on the table’ in discussions.</p>
      <p>‘I can tell you that were the United States or any other country to insist on that as a condition of talks, we would simply walk out,’ Mr Johnson said.</p>
      <p>‘It is perfectly obvious as leader of this country that if any government was to be so mad as to go down that route then they would never be elected.’</p>
      <p>The prime minister also used his appearance on LBC to say Britain would leave the European Union by January 31 ‘at the absolute latest’ if his Conservative Party win a majority in the election.</p>
