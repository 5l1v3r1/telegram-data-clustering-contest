      <p>Wellburn’s Market, a grocery store at Cook and Pandora downtown for more than a century, was forced to close its doors Friday morning after a sewage main problem in the building.</p>
      <p>Customers were being turned away at about 10 a.m. after a city notice was posted, according to one customer who said the sewage system in the building’s basement had collapsed.</p>
      <p>A barbershop next door was also forced to close. The building also has living units on the upper floor.</p>
      <p>Wellburn’s had intended to close its doors sometime in 2020, and a redevelopment of the site is expected.</p>
      <p>The grocery chain Save on Foods opened this year nearby at Pandora and Vancouver streets.</p>
