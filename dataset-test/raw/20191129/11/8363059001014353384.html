      <h1>Nintendo's Labo Robot is Mega-Cheap for Black Friday</h1>

      <p>We're huge fans of Labo, Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/05/nintendo-labos-true-promise/">risk-taking cardboard DIY accessories</a> for the Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>We first tried out the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/04/unboxing-labo-nintendos-new-cardboard-play-kit/">awesome robot kit</a> back when it first came out last April, but if you haven't got one yet, this is the best chance yet to grab it at a bargain price.</p>
      <p>For Black Friday, Amazon has reduced the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0792QY3C7">Labo Robot Toy-Con kit</a> from £39.49 to just £14.99, a saving of £24.50, or 62% for all the percentage fans out there.</p>

      <p>The Labo Robot Toy-Con kit is suitable for kids 3 and up, plus adults of course -- but you will need a full Nintendo Switch to be able to use it, because you have to be able to put the Joy-Cons inside it, and the ones on the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/the-nintendo-switch-lite-is-a-pitch-perfect-remake/">Switch Lite</a> don't come off.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0792QY3C7">Grab it here while it's cheap</a>, then <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/nintendo-black-friday-deals/">check out Nintendo's own Black Friday deals</a>.</p>
