      <h3>PHILIPPINE Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) General Manager Royina Marzan-Garma welcomed the result of the probe conducted by the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) into the alleged corruption involving some of the agency’s officials.</h3>
      <p>PACC chairperson Dante Jimenez said the results of the investigation against the officials of the PCSO will  be submitted to President Rodrigo Duterte in early January.</p>
      <p>Garma said the results will not only clear their names but will also prove the integrity of the Agency.</p>
      <p>“The PCSO management welcomes the initiative of the PACC to investigate the alleged involvement of PCSO officials on corruption issues.  PCSO upholds transparency in conducting the operations of the Agency,” Garma told reporters when sought for a comment.</p>
      <p>“Despite of the corruption issues beleaguering the Office, the officials remain steadfast in their commitment to serve the PCSO and the public with integrity and transparency,” Garma added.</p>
      <p>The PCSO , a revenue generating agency mandated for raising and providing funds for health programs, medical assistance and services, and charities.</p>
      <p>The Individual Medical Assistance Program (IMAP) is considered the flagship program of the PCSO which was institutionalized in 1995 to provide timely and responsive financial assistance to individuals with health-related problems.</p>
      <p>Aside from  IMAP, the PCSO’s other charity programs include the Endowment Fund Program, Institutional Partnership Program, Procurement of Medical Equipment, AFP/PNP Health Facilities Capability Building Project, Calamity Assistance Program, Milk Feeding Program, Integrated Health for Overall Productivity and Empowerment (I-HOPE), and Out-Patient Services Program (Medical and Dental Services), among others.</p>
      <p>On August 14, PACC commissioner Greco Belgica said Malacañang had submitted the names of erstwhile and incumbent PCSO board members, managers, and agents who will be subject to investigation.</p>
      <p>Belgica said the 15 PCSO officials will undergo lifestyle check, as they hold “critical” and “important” positions.</p>
      <p>Jimenez raised the possibility that the PCSO personnel might face charges for alleged irregularities.</p>
      <p>The PACC was prompted to investigate the alleged corrupt PCSO officials and employees after Duterte on July 26 ordered the suspension of all games operated by the state gaming firm, including lotto, Small Town Lottery (STL), Keno, and Peryahan ng Bayan, because of “massive” corruption.</p>
      <p>However, the President lifted on July 31 the suspension order of lotto operations in the country, since the lottery game “remained untainted.”</p>
