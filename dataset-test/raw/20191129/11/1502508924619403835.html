      <p>Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/babul-supriyo">Babul Supriyo </a>on Friday claimed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brazil">Brazil </a>looks like Goa and both have similar "natural beauties".</p>
      <p>He was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the Canacona Bypass, built at a cost of Rs 227 crore, and named after former chief minister late <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/manohar-parrikar">Manohar Parrikar.</a></p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brazil">Brazil </a>looks like Goa. I won't say Goa looks like <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brazil">Brazil.</a> Both the destinations have similar natural beauties," Supriyo said in the presence of chief minister Pramod Sawant.</p>
      <p>Supriyo said the 7-kilometre long bypass was one of the country's first bridges which is built over three rivers, namely Galjibag, Talpona and Mashem, and will connect the coastal state to neighbouring Karnataka.</p>
      <p>He praised Parrikar and said several aspirations of the people, which were earlier just dreams, were now being fulfilled by the Narendra Modi government.</p>
      <p>Citing the example of the Canacona Bypass, Supriyo said it was in the pipeline for three decades but foundation stone was laid in 2015 under the NDA government.</p>
