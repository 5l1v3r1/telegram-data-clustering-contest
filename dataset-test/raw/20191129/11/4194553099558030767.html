      <h1>Liverpool vs Brighton Hove &amp; Albion Preview: Reds look to dominant win at Anfield after Champions League stumble</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:46:16+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/tomsimmons/" target="_blank">Tom Simmons</a></address>
      <p>There really seems to be no stopping Liverpool’s quest on finally getting their hands on the Premier League trophy this year. This seems set to be the year they break the duck and the win against Crystal Palace, where they were extremely unconvincing, proved why. </p>
      <p>The Reds capitalized on the little chances they go, again showing the might of champions to come up with a late winner. As much as teams hope they’ll stumble, Jurgen Klopp’s side keeps disappointing their doubters throughout.</p>
      <p>But after being held by Napoli at Anfield, there’s reason for a better showing against Brighton on Saturday. Fabinho’s injury <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11871939/fabinho-jurgen-klopp-admits-injury-could-be-massive">caused worry for Klopp</a> as well, who’s hoping it isn’t anything serious. </p>
      <p>The Reds, of course, have a tremendous home record in recent times but must throttle up their engines to dominate an unpredictable Brighton side.</p>
      <p>Every Liverpool player is trying to outperform each other this season, resulting in their valiant showing. Trent Alexander-Arnold seems set to become an England regular before the Euro 2020, with his precise crossing, amazing creative ability making him an irresistible asset.</p>
      <p>Virgil Van Dijk’s finding his unbreakable strength back. He’s the defensive general for Netherlands as well and will be key towards marshalling them towards success in the Euros, and these <a href="https://www.bet-bonuscode.co.uk/euro-2020-betting-offers/">Euro 2020 betting offers</a> can be put to good use to backing the Dutch next summer. </p>
      <p>Alongside him, Georginio Wijnaldum’s a more productive figure for his nation. Andrew Robertson’s just as diligent for Scotland, while Jordan Henderson’s an industrious leader for England. Just like his renowned team-mates, he’ll also play a huge part for nation in the Euros. </p>
      <p>But before that, the more immediate matter of concern will be thwarting Brighton. The Seagulls have become a more fearless unit under Graham Potter, showing more eagerness bombing forward in numbers. </p>
      <p>They’ll put up a strong fight at Anfield, which means Liverpool’s front three definitely have to be more clinical than they were against Napoli to come up with a resounding win. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Liverpool Predicted XI:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson, Milner, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brighton Predicted XI:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ryan, Montoya, Dunk, Webster, Burn, Propper, Stephens, March, Mooy, Maupey, Trossard</p>
      <p>
        <b>Key Clashes:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Mohamed Salah vs Daniel Burn</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mo Salah’s ankle has <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1204443/Liverpool-news-Mohamed-Salah-ankle-injury-update-Instagram">caused him some problems</a> recently, but he looked fit and roaring against Napoli. Despite coming up short then, he’ll look to get his groove back in the league game and slice apart Brighton. </p>
      <p>Salah’s menacing incisiveness and goal-scoring accuracy make him perfect for these kinds of games at Anfield, but Dan Burn won’t make it easy. The intimidating left-back is a powerful customer with a dominative nature about him. </p>
      <p>The Egyptian must be clever penetrating past him if he’s to break Brighton’s defensive line and thrill the Anfield crowd again.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Leandro Trossard vs<a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/23/video-trent-rakes-a-straight-60-yard-cross-fielder-that-sums-up-jaw-dropping-passing-ability/"> Trent Alexander-Arnold</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>For all his excellence roaring forward and putting in pitch-perfect crosses into the box, Trent Alexander-Arnold still isn’t the most convincing defensively. His resolve will be tested by the tricky Leandro Trossard, who’s lightened up Brighton’s attacks with his sizzling moves. </p>
      <p>The young Belgian’s a menace with his fiery dribbling ability, as Alexander-Arnold must maintain concentration to nullify his threat and gain the confidence to throttle ahead.</p>
