      <h1>realme To Expand Beyond Phones; Plans To Make Wearables And True Wireless Headsets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:00:52+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>Since its <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2018/173135/realme-2-pro-review-yet-another-affordable-mid-range-smartphone/">first batch</a>, realme has churned out <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/185939/realme-3-pro-hands-on-taking-the-place-of-its-predecessor/">phone</a> after <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/200215/realme-5-pro-review/">phone</a> is a very short period of time. But there’s no sign of the company slowing down. New reports indicate that, if anything, it will be speeding up instead, making more than just smartphones in the future.</p>
      <p>Digitimes reports that Chung Hsiang-wei, chief commercial officer of realme Taiwan, said that the company plans to tap into the wearbles and true wireless headset market in the future. This is part of the company’s goal to build its own ecosystem of products. It also wants to be completely independent of its sister company, OPPO.</p>
      <p>As it is now, realme shares a lot of resources with OPPO. The former even uses the latter’s ColorOS, with slight changes. That said, realme already has its own R&amp;D department that helps differenciate the products of the two brands. It is also expected to builld its own production lines as well.</p>

      <p>Conveniently, both companies also have different user bases and target audiences. OPPO makes phones that are closer to the high end of the spectrum, and are mostly used by women. On the other hand, realme phones are mostly used by men, and are catered more towareds a younger user base.</p>
      <p>realme has recently announced its upcoming <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/200184/realme-confirms-upcoming-x50-5g-phone/">X50 5G</a> phone, which will likely be the most expensive phone by the company. It’s first flagship-level device, the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/196442/realme-x2-pro-official-64mp/">X2 Pro</a>, was also unveiled not too long ago, and is priced well below flagships of other brands.</p>
