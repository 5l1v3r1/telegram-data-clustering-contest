          <p>It all happened on the third delivery of the 42nd over when Australia opening batsman David Warner cut a delivery from Pakistan all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed.</p>

                      <p>After Australia captain Tim Paine won the toss and chose to bat, the hosts didn’t get off to the best of starts as Afridi made early inroads into their batting lineup by dismissing opening batman Joe Burns (4) in the fourth over.</p>
                      <p>However, Warner and all-rounder Marnus Labuschagne made amends for Australia soon after. The pair is in the middle of a 200+ partnership.</p>

                          <p>It is worth mentioning the ongoing match is being played with the pink ball under lights. It was back in 2015 that the first day-night Test match was played at the same venue. While this is Australia sixth home day-night Test, it is the fourth one in Adelaide.</p>
