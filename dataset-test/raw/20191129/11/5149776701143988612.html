      <h2>'You named your cat Chips? Was there another one named Poker?'</h2>

      <p>When you tweet about something that's happened in in your everyday life, you probably hope it will get a few likes and maybe the occasional retweet.</p>
      <p>What you don't expect is for Tom Hanks to read it out in a video which is seen by more than eight million people.</p>
      <p>But that's exactly what has happened to a woman from Nottingham who posted a message about her cat six months ago.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Live reported back in May how <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/nottingham-womans-simple-tweet-been-2895202">Karen Miele had tweeted</a> about a lady named Jean, who had taken a photo of Karen's cat, and then posted it through her letterbox for her.</p>
      <p>The note read: "For you. Your lovely cat I always look for him. Jean."</p>
      <p>Karen's tweet about her cat Chips and Jean went viral. And now Tom Hanks has read out the tweet in a collection of some of the nicest and best moments that can be found on Twitter around the world.</p>

      <p>The star of Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Cast Away and many more posted the video on the Twitter Movies account just ahead of Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, November 28.</p>
      <p>He said of Karen's tweet: "Oh, my lord. Who doesn't love cats?"</p>
      <p>He then added: "Chips, huh? You named your cat Chips? Was there another one named Poker?"</p>
      <p>Karen is originally from St Austell in Cornwall but now works as an artist in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>She tweeted her own response to the actor's message, writing: "No big deal, just <a href="https://twitter.com/tomhanks">@tomhanks</a> reading out my tweets. â€œYou called your cat Chips?!"</p>
      <p>Karen's original tweet has been liked more than 235,000 times since it was posted in May.</p>
