      <h1>The ‘Downton Abbey’ Producer Is Trying To Make A Second Movie Happen &amp; Oh, Bless Him</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:44:07+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">By Steffanie Tan</a></address>
      <p>We’re one (sort of) step closer to a <i>Downton Abbey </i>movie sequel, something we don’t really need but HELL, why not? I bloody love <i>Downton Abbey</i>. And according to the latest morsel of gold, the blessed minds behind the series are genuinely trying to make a sequel happen.</p>
      <p>Months earlier, when the movie had just hit screens, series creator <b>Julian Fellowes </b>said he would only make up his mind about a sequel after he saw the response to it.</p>
      <p>“It’s a combination of the [box office, audience buzz] all off it, to be honest, and then you get a picture of whether this movie landed,” he told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/downton-abbey-creators-cast-movie-potential-sequel-1240542">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “I think you can get a sense of whether it worked or not. And if we do get that sense, then we will have that conversation.”</p>
      <p>WELL, turns out the team started “vaguely” thinking about it before the release of the movie.</p>
      <p>Producer <b>Gareth Neame </b>said the reaction to the movie, the press tour in the United States of A, and the buildup to its release were “so strong that we’d been thinking about it.”</p>
      <p>“And then it was clear from the first weekend that this was worth taking very seriously,” he told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gareth-neame-talks-downton-abbey-sequel-1256873">THR</a>.</p>
      <p>Nothing’s set in stone though. The team first have to put together a story… then there’s the question of the cast.</p>
      <p>“The challenge will be, is everyone available at the same time? Can we make deals with them? That will be the challenge.”</p>
      <p>I mean, they probably will be. The cast seem to genuinely love being part of that world.</p>
      <p>(I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again – just bring back the goddamn series already)</p>
      <p>This is the part where I say “<i>Downton Abbey </i>is on Netflix” but they GOT RID OF IT. Wait never mind, all six seasons are available on Amazon Prime Video.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Downton Abbey is available for your viewing pleasure on Amazon Prime Video now.” </i>
