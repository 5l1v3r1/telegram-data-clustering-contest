      <p>The company behind the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday has bought rival the i for £49.6 million – its fourth owner in as many years, it was announced.</p>
      <p>Lord Rothermere, who is chairman and biggest shareholder in Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), said the deal would not lead to a change in editorial style and the i will remain independent.</p>
      <p>But the decision was attacked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, suggesting the new owner could influence the newspaper’s a-political position to “attack Labour’s plan to make the super-rich pay their fair share”.</p>

      <p>The owner insisted editorial independence will remain. Lord Rothermere said: “(The i) is a highly respected publication with a loyal and engaged readership.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high-quality and politically independent editorial style.</p>
      <p>“The business will benefit from DMGT’s long-term approach and commitment to investing in editorial content.”</p>
      <p>The chairman, who is the great-grandson of the Daily Mail’s founder, added he sees good opportunities to develop the i’s website, and believes the newspaper will be a “strong cash generator” for the group.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the i sells around 170,000 copies each weekday and 190,000 copies on Saturdays. In 2018, revenues were £34 million with £11 million in “cash operating income and operating profit”.</p>

      <p>However, the deal is expected to be looked at by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for any potential breaches of competition laws.</p>
      <p>The i and DMGT’s newspaper operations are already based in the same Northcliffe House offices in Kensington, west London, and share some facilities and systems.</p>
      <p>Bosses insist they do not expect to make any redundancies and the newspaper has been on a recent hiring spree, with an editorial floor of around 80 journalists.</p>

      <p>Editor Oly Duff said on his Twitter feed: “Very grateful to former owners JPIMedia (as well as Johnston Press and before 2016 ESI Media) for their courage, imagination and support, transforming a start-up into a highly trusted UK media publisher that also turns a profit and has a healthy, sustainable future.”</p>
      <p>He added that there will be “no change to staff employment T&amp;Cs, pay, roles, editors”. The boss also attempted to reassure readers that editorial independence would remain.</p>
      <p>Should the CMA investigate the deal, which is expected, Mr Duff added that the i will be “held separate” from new and old owners.</p>
      <p>Paul Zwillenberg, chief executive of DMGT, added: “The i has a different editorial style and tone to the Mail and the audience has a different demographic. I want to make absolutely clear that we will ensure that the editorial independence of the i is preserved.</p>
      <p>“Delivering quality content in both print and digital formats is a core competence of DMGT. We will invest in the editorial content as we believe the i can benefit from DMGT’s long-term approach to investing through the cycle to support market share gains.”</p>
      <p>Following Mr Corbyn’s comments, Mr Duff wrote on Twitter: “Dear Jeremy, We were comfortable holding you to account when you were an i reader (still are? not sure) and we will continue to do so!</p>
      <p>“Every leader of every other political party can expect the same – since we report on politics without fear or favour. It’s why our readers trust us. They judge us on our journalism. Hopefully you will welcome the same scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“And on a point of fact we haven’t actually attacked Labour’s plan to make the highest earners pay more tax… We remain editorially independent, politically impartial. Best – Oly”</p>
