      <h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC’s Consolidation To End-Up In a Huge Weekend Move?  </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:03:46+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author">Yuval Gov</a></address>
      <p>It took just a few hours after we posted our previous Bitcoin price analysis, and Bitcoin broke out nicely the $7400 resistance, which is the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern.</p>
      <p>Since then, Bitcoin quickly made a move to our next mentioned resistance level of $7700 and quickly got rejected. Over the past 40 hours, Bitcoin is trading under the tight range of $7400 to $7700.</p>
      <p>From the bullish side, after such a massive move ($6800 to $7700), a correction or consolidation was expected. So far, the correction is healthy, as confirming the $7400 as support. The bottom line is that it’s safe to say that holding up the last level, the $7400, and the direction for Bitcoin’s short-term is up.</p>
      <p>Another thing to note is the significant descending trend-line, which is marked on the following daily chart (the one that started forming as Bitcoin reached its 2019 high during June). The trend-line is slowing Bitcoin’s pace in its way North.</p>
      <p>Just a reminder, the inverse head, and shoulders pattern granted Bitcoin a further target of $8300. Of course, this doesn’t mean the target will be reached for sure, but so far, the settings look healthy for Bitcoin to continue upwards.</p>
      <p>And last, the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-bitcoin-and-crypto-futures-guide-for-beginners/">CME Futures</a> monthly expiration is taking place in the next hours (16:00 UTC). Usually, this event has a significant short-term influence on the price of Bitcoin.</p>

      <h3>Key Levels to Watch</h3>
      <p><b>– Support/Resistance:</b> Following the breakout of the $7400 resistance (the “neckline”), the next level of resistance lies at $7700, which was tested twice over the past 48 hours. This also contains the 1-day’s short-term descending trend-line.</p>
      <p>In case Bitcoin can make it, then further resistance lies at $8000, before reaching the $8300 target and the $8400, which is also the 50-days moving average line (marked pink on the 1-day chart).</p>
      <p>From below, the first level of support is the $7400 level. Further down is $7300, along with the 4-hour MA-50 (marked in pink line). Below lies the good old $7000 benchmark.</p>
      <p><b>– The RSI Indicator:</b> The RSI also had done a nice breakout of the descending channel, as mentioned in our previous analysis. Following that, the RSI is getting very close to the 44-45 horizontal resistance.</p>
      <p><b>– Trading volume:</b> The volume is declining over the past week. This can be the settings for the next big move of Bitcoin that may reach out at any time.</p>
