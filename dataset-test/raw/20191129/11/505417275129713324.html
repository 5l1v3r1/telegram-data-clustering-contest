        <b>The 26 top Irish performers from across the sporting world this year have been longlisted for the RTÉ Sportsperson of the Year award 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following his first major title win at The Open in Portrush earlier this year, it’s no surprise that Shane Lowry is included in the list. He is joined by fellow golfer Rory McIlroy.</p>
      <p>Another favourite on the list is Katie Taylor who made history by unifying all four World Lightweight titles before adding the WBO Super Lightweight belt to her collection.</p>
      <p>From the world of GAA, All-Ireland captains and respective Players of the Year, Seamus Callanan and Stephen Cluxton have been longlisted as well as Dublin star Sinead Goldrick, who scored a crucial goal in the All-Ireland final against Galway, and Senior Players’ Player of the Year, Niamh Kilkenny.</p>

Also included is Denise O’Sullivan following another successful year with North Carolina Courage where she was named the club’s ‘Most Valuable Player’ and ‘Women’s Senior International Player of the Year’.</p>
      <p>A number of athletes are longlisted following impressive performances at the European and World Championships, including Ciara Mageean and Rhys McClenaghan.</p>
