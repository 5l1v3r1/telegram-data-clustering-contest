      <p>Two days after an attempted child abduction in West Kelowna, police are now warning the public.</p>
      <p>Just before 4 p.m. Wednesday, an 11-year-old girl walking on Cougar Road was approached by a man in a car.</p>
      <p>Police say the man gestured to the backseat, encouraging the girl to get inside. The child refused and ran home.</p>
      <p>The suspect is described as a tanned, possibly bald man in his mid-40s, with a heavier build, and white bearded chin. He was wearing small, circular glasses.</p>
      <p>The man was driving a blue, four-door sedan with rusted wheels and squeaky brakes. He was last seen near Cougar and Grizzly roads.</p>
      <p>Police are currently canvassing the area for surveillance footage. They've asked anyone with information to contact West Kelowna RCMP at 250-768-2880.</p>
