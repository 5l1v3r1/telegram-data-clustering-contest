      <p>New Delhi: The Centre is formulating a scheme to find a permanent solution to the practice <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/stubble-burning">stubble burning</a> by farmers and has constituted a committee to come out with a report on the matter in a month or two, Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Parshottam Rupala said in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajya-Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a> on Friday. Replying to a supplementary question on 'Effect of Stubble Burning on Fertility of Land' during Question Hour, Rupala said at present there is no provision of any financial assistance to farmers for stubble.</p>
      <p>"A meeting was chaired by the ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) secretary. A committee has been formed to formulate a new scheme" for a long-term permanent solution to stubble buring by farmers, he said.</p>
      <p>The MoS said that the new committee will come out with a new scheme within one or two months.</p>
      <p>He said in some states farmers burn stubble for sowing the next crop and the government is planning to educate them about diversification of crops.</p>
      <p>Besides, the government has given machines worth Rs 1,151 crore to farmers for managing stubble besides creating awareness.</p>
      <p>A total of 55,000 machines were provided to three states, he said, and added that Delhi is not managing it well.</p>
      <p>The Minister said that paddy stubble burning is mainly practised in the Indo-Gangetic plains in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Punjab">Punjab</a>, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Haryana">Haryana</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Uttar-Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> to clear the fields for rabi crop sowing.</p>
      <p>"It has been estimated that one tonne of paddy straw contains approximately 5.5 kg nitrogen, 2.3 kg phosphorous pentoxide, 25 kg potassium oxide, 1.2 kg sulphur, 50-70 per cent of micro-nutrients absorbed by rice and 400 kg of carbon which are lost due to burning of paddy straw," he said.</p>
      <p>Apart from the loss of nutrients, some soil nutrients, some soil properties like soil temperature, pH, moisture, available <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and soil organic matter, which also govern microbial population of soil, are greatly affected due to stubble burning, he said.</p>
      <p>"To address pollution and to subsidize machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue, a central sector scheme on 'promotion of agricultural mechanisation for in-situ management of crop residue in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi' for the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 is being implemented with a total outgo from the central fund of Rs 1,151.80 crore," he said.
