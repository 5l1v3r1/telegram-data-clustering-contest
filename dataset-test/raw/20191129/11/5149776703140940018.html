      <h2>Nottingham Forest news| The Reds are backing the LGBT+ community at the City Ground on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:54:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Davies</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest have announced that fixture against Cardiff City is the club’s designated awareness match for the Rainbow Laces campaign.</p>
      <p>The campaign is aiming to show support for the LGBT+ community and that football is everyone’s game, and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> have said there will be a number of activities as part of the awareness match.</p>
      <p>The players will be warming-up in t-shirts with the LGBT Trickies logo on, the supporter group for LGBT+ fans of the club, while the rainbow colours will also adorn the corner flag, captain’s armband and the fourth official’s LED board.</p>
      <p>There will also be a double-page feature in the matchday programme and content on the big screens throughout the match to raise awareness and encourage supporters to unite behind the campaign.</p>
      <p>Kevin George, from LGBT Trickies, said: "As an LGBT+ group we are very proud to work with Nottingham Forest Football Club in addressing the issues of inclusivity."</p>
      <p>"Since we were formed we have worked closely with the club.</p>
