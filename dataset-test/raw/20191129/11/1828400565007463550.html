      <h1>Blackpool striker Armand Gnanduillet fights to be fit for FA Cup tie with Maidstone United</h1>
      <h2>Simon Grayson has revealed that Armand Gnanduillet faces a race against the clock to be fit in time for Blackpool’s FA Cup tie against Maidstone United.</h2>

      <p>The striker, who is suffering with a thigh injury he picked up in the recent win against AFC Wimbledon, missed his second game running in midweek.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman could be back in time for Sunday’s second round tie at Bloomfield Road, but Grayson was unable to provide any assurances.</p>
      <p>“He was never going to be fit (for Wednesday’s EFL Trophy game against Scunthorpe United), although his thigh is making progress,” the Pool boss told The Gazette.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see where he is for the weekend but this game was never going to be a consideration.</p>
      <p>“If he was fit he’d have been around it but he wasn’t. He wasn’t being rested or anything like that.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see where he is for the weekend.”</p>
      <p>The Seasiders will be hoping to avoid an embarrassing cup exit to a side that ply their trade in the National League South.</p>
      <p>Grayson will be keen to see a reaction from his side after publicly blasting the players that featured in the midweek defeat in the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>That loss brought an end to Pool’s seven-game unbeaten run in all competitions.</p>
      <p>“Players have played themselves out of contention,” Grayson said.</p>
      <p>“You pick a team at the weekend that obviously wants to win the game and I want to see a reaction the next time we’re in training.</p>
      <p>“I want to see them be professional, play with a purpose, training with an edge, because we had no edge to us on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Over the last few weeks when we’ve had good results we played with an edge both with and without the ball. We didn’t have it this time.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to win the game and carry on the momentum and try and keep progressing and win as many matches as is possible.</p>
      <p>“I don’t mind losing matches if you lose it with a purpose in terms of working hard, closing down and trying to outrun the opposition. But we didn’t do that.”</p>
