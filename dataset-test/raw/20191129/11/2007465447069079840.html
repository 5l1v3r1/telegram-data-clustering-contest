      <h1>Drive the Jaguar Vision concept and more in new GT Sport update</h1>
      <h2>Five new cars get re-imagined by Gran Turismo Sport</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:38:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/aurick-go.html" target="_blank">Aurick Go</a></address>
      <p>This November, Polyphony Digital brings a slew of sports cars to further diversify their lineup for GT Sport. With four rather familiar vehicles coming into play and one new Vision Gran Turismo concept vehicle, there appears to be enough variety to be enticed to boot the game up for the update once again.</p>
      <p>For starters, Jaguar finally joins the Vision GT lineup with their very own Jaguar Vision Gran Turismo Coupe concept. Streamlined and low slung like majority of the VGT models, this appears to be Jaguar’s vision of a no-holds-barred vehicle.</p>

      <p>Rotary fans have something to rejoice for, as the RE Amemiya FD3S demo car makes a return to the GT series. To make full use of this new rotary rocket, two new races for The Passion of Dr. Wankel Beginner event have been updated. Alongside this, the facelifted version of the Toyota 86 also makes its way to GT Sport.</p>

      <p>Those of the European persuasion would be glad to know that the BMW E46 M3 finally makes a comeback to the game. A track rat favorite both in Europe and in the US, it truly makes sense to add this vehicle into GT Sport. Joining the BMW is a new RUF model.</p>

      <p>The RUF CTR3, based originally on the 987 Cayman, is an example that truly distinguishes RUF from conventional Porsche models and looks very much to be a welcome addition to the game despite Porsche’s return to the game.</p>
      <p>Apart from the five free vehicles, a purchasable DLC wherein players can challenge lap times set by 6-time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton will also be available. Unfortunately, however, no new circuit will come into play for this November update.</p>
