      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has revealed that her daughter Kylie spends up to $400,000 on security every month.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old, who was named the world’s youngest self-made billionaire earlier this year, needs security “everywhere” she goes.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her daughter on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here, Caitlyn said: “I bet you Kylie will spend anywhere between 300,000 and 400,000 dollars a month on security, everywhere she goes. It’s a big operation.”</p>

      <p>Fellow campmate Roman Kemp then asked: “How does that make you feel that your daughters have to go through that just to go to the shops?”</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old replied: “It’s sad, but they have been doing it forever, they like having the security guys there.”</p>
      <p>Despite spending so much money on security, guards at Kylie’s house failed to stop an obsessed fan from getting to her front door last month.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The reality star was forced to seek a restraining order against a man in October, after he managed to sneak into her gated community.</p>

      <p>The man allegedly knocked on Kylie’s front door “aggressively”, and claimed that he was there to visit her.</p>
      <p>He was quickly escorted away by her security team, and was later arrested.</p>
      <p>According to court documents obtained by E! News, Kylie said: “I have suffered, and continue to suffer emotional distress.”</p>
      <p>The reality star also expressed concern for her one-year-old daughter, Stormi, by stating: “I have a young child and also fear for her safety.”</p>
      <p>The man has since been ordered to stay 100 yards away from Kylie, her property, workplace and car.</p>
