      <p>KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A retired Pakistani industrialist sent thousands of saplings to Iraq on Friday to bring shade to pilgrims, an idea formed when his relatives returned from a holy site with sunburn.</p>
      <p>Mohammedi Durbar, 85, wants to plant nearly 50,000 trees along the entire 80-km (50-mile) pilgrimage route between Iraq's Shi’ite Muslim holy cities of Najaf and Kerbala.</p>
      <p>Millions of people make the pilgrimage every for the religious ritual of Arbaeen, which marks the 40-day mourning period for the grandson of the Prophet Mohammad. They walk most of the way under a baking sun.</p>
      <p>Among the worshippers last year were Durbar's grandson and daughter-in-law, who returned to Pakistan tanned and with photographs showing a barren landscape.</p>
      <p>"I immediately realised there was no shade," Durbar told Reuters at his farm on the outskirts of the city of Karachi.</p>
      <p>Durbar travelled to Iraq, spoke to officials and got permission for his project, and a promise the trees would be cared for. He also planted some trees in Najaf to see if they could thrive there.</p>
      <p>The test was a success. "The trees are happy," he said.</p>
      <p>A first batch of 9,800 saplings of eight types of trees, up to eight months old, set off from Karachi by truck on Friday, for their journey across Iran to Iraq.</p>
      <p>The shipment was delayed about a month because of anti-government protests in Iraq and last minute visa delays.</p>
      <p>Durbar says the saplings will be well looked after on their journey with the truck stopping to ensure they get regular sunshine and water.</p>
      <p>He is confident they will arrive in good shape and plans to travel back to Iraq to work on the plan.</p>
      <p>The trees will spend the winter in a nursery in Baghdad, with the planting due to begin in March.</p>
      <p>He said about a dozen people would plant the trees, with the help of small digger he is also sending from Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Durbar, a member of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Shia Islam, estimates it will take three years to plant all of the trees at a cost of 25 million rupees ($160,000), which he is paying.</p>
      <p>He is not sure if he will live to see pilgrims walking under his trees, but he knows he has found his calling after a lifetime in industry.</p>
      <p>"I thank God, at this age, he has put me on the right path," he said.</p>
      <p>"Partnership with nature is good.”</p>
