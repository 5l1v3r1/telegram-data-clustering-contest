      <h2>Residents might think Scrooge has got his hands on Blackpool's Christmas trees this festive season.</h2>

      <p>For some of the traditional spruces paid for by ward councillors around the town are set to be several feet shorter in height this year.</p>

      <p>Town hall chiefs say the root of the problem lies with a national scarcity of taller trees.</p>
      <p>Instead of the usual 25-foot tall pines, this year's trees are around 18-foot in height.</p>
      <p>Waterloo ward councillors Derek Robertson and David O'Hara are among a number of councillors who have spent Â£1,590 per tree from their ward budget in order to bring seasonal cheer to residential neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p>Coun Roberston said: "I noticed our tree at Holy Trinity church on Dean Street was a bit short so I reported it to the council.</p>
      <p>"We paid for 25-foot trees like last year but they are only 18-foot. The council is now going around the area measuring all the trees and will be asking for a refund from the contractor if they are too short."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Blackpool Council blamed the problem on a national shortage of tall Christmas trees.</p>
      <p>They said: "The contractor has done their best to meet the order for 25-foot tall trees, but due to a national shortage these trees are not available.</p>
      <p>"So they have sent the tallest trees they could and at least the trees have been put up and are there for people to enjoy."</p>
      <p>The shortage is believed to be due to legislation to protect British woodland from the risk of pest infestations from imported plants, which has pushed up costs.</p>
      <p>For the first time this year, Christmas trees more than three metres in height will require a Plant Passport to enter the UK.</p>
      <p>Blackpool is not the only place to miss out on tall Christmas trees.</p>
      <p>Each year Scottish Borders Council donates a 30-foot tall pine to every town in its area, but bosses have also been unable to source the regular trees meaning communities have been given 20-feet tall ones instead.</p>
