      <p>Wellburn’s Market, a grocery store at Cook and Pandora that's been downtown for more than a century, was forced to close its doors Friday morning after a sewage line problem in the building.</p>
      <p>Customers were being turned away at about 10 a.m. after a notice was posted, according to one customer who said the sewage system in the building’s basement had collapsed.</p>
      <p>A barbershop next door was also forced to close. The building also has living units on the upper floor.</p>
      <p>The City of Victoria said the problem is not with the municipality’s system, and no other buildings are affected.</p>
      <p>Wellburn’s had intended to close its doors sometime in 2020, and a redevelopment of the site is expected.</p>
      <p>The grocery chain Save-on-Foods opened this year at Pandora Avenue and Vancouver Streets.</p>
