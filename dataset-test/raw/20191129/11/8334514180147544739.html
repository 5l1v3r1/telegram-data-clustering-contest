      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that Britain would leave the European Union by Jan. 31 at the latest if his Conservative Party win a majority in the election in two weeks time.</p>
      <p>“If we can get a working majority then we will come on Jan. 31 at the absolute latest,” Johnson told LBC radio.</p>
      <p>He also repeated his message that he saw no reason why Britain would need to extend the transition period after Brexit beyond the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>Asked if he would rather be prime minister or have Britain leave the EU, he replied: “I would rather get us out of the EU. I can tell you that.”</p>
