      <p>NEW DELHI: The Delhi and District <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Association <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ombudsman">ombudsman</a> Justice (Retd) Badar Durrez Ahmed on Friday accepted senior journalist <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajat-Sharma">Rajat Sharma</a>'s resignation from the position of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/DDCA">DDCA</a> president, nearly a fortnight after putting a stay on it.</p>
      <p>Sharma had resigned on November 16, citing "various pulls and pressures" within the organisation. His resignation was stayed by Ahmed a day later but has finally been accepted after a fresh request from the media personality.</p>
      <p>"I wrote to him in the morning and told him to relieve me of my responsibilities," Sharma told PTI.</p>
      <p>In his letter to Ahmed, Sharma stated that he could not continue in an organisation, which is in a "chaotic" state.</p>
      <p>"I resigned on November 16 from post of president DDCA for the reasons stated in the letter. I however continued to honour the directions of the ombudsman and later reiterated by the High Court. However, the situation in DDCA is completely chaotic and I find it impossible to continue any further as president," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Sharma's nearly 20-month tenure was a tumultuous one marred by public differences with general secretary Vinod Tihara, who enjoys a fair amount of support base in the organisation.</p>
      <p>Tihara won the DDCA elections contesting for Sharma's group but had a fallout with the president within a few weeks on various cricket and administration-related issues. It included allegations that Tihara tried to control recruitment process in the DDCA without following protocol.</p>
      <p>Tihara was then suspended by the executive committee on disciplinary grounds which he subsequently challenged in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Delhi-High-Court">Delhi High Court</a>.</p>
      <p>"I find it impossible to work with people who have no respect for the Ombudsman or the High Court or the constitution," Sharma wrote in his letter to Ahmed.</p>
      <p>Within hours of Sharma's resignation on November 16, CEO Ravi Chopra also put in his papers.</p>
      <p>The two-member Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), comprising Sunil Valson and Yashpal Sharma, too tendered resignation.</p>
      <p>A day later, Ahmed ordered Sharma to continue and stopped suspended general secretary Tihara's reinstatement.</p>
      <p>"It is clear that Rajat sharma has expressed his desire not to continue as president of DDCA. This entire controversy surrounding his resignation does not survive any more," Ahmed said on Friday.</p>
