      <h1>Anfield expansion plans announced – Reds will have 3rd biggest stadium, with Kop ‘dwarfed’ by Annie Road End</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:06:39+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have announced plans to increase the capacity of Anfield to around 61,000 – with roughly 7,000 additional seats being added to the Anfield Road End.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-anfield-road-stadium-news-17331548">Echo</a> state that these tickets will all be made available on general admission, which will hopefully ease some of the problems members have had securing tickets this – and every other – season.</p>
      <p>The Annie Road will have 16,000 capacity in total, which will make it one third bigger than the Kop.</p>
      <p>Only Manchester United (76k) and Tottenham (62k) will have bigger grounds than Liverpool, who are currently sixth in the Premier League list behind West Ham, Arsenal and Manchester City as well.</p>
      <p>The Echo state a ‘two-part public consultation with local residents’ will begin today, with a planning permission application set to be issued in 2020.</p>
      <p>Anfield’s redevelopment, the second since FSG arrived following the Main Stand revamp, will cost £60m, says the report, who also suggest the stand’s naming rights may be sold to a sponsor.</p>
