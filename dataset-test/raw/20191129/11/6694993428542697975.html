      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:57:13+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Robson, https://www.facebook.com/Manchester-City-Centre-News-381745735717650/</a></address>
      <p>A mum has accused police and schools of failing to tackle knife crime after her son was allegedly targeted by bullies in a series of frightening attacks.</p>
      <p>The 14-year-old, who has special needs, is a pupil at Priestnall School in Stockport.</p>
      <p>His mum, who asked not to be named, said he has been targeted before by cruel boys who have locked him in a toilet.</p>
      <p>But the situation escalated in recent weeks when her son allegedly had a knife held to his throat by a fellow Priestnall pupil in an attempted mugging.</p>
      <p>The incident is said to have happened at the home of the alleged offender.</p>
      <p>The mum believes her son was 'lured' into visiting the boy's address where she says he was threatened with the blade and told to hand over his phone and wallet.</p>
      <p>The boy managed to flee, but was confronted by the alleged offender and another boy near to their school in Heaton Moor the next day, his mum says.</p>

      <p>"They got him in a headlock and threw him to the floor," his mum said.</p>
      <p>"Then the two of them stamped on his head.</p>
      <p>"He said to me 'mummy I just put my hands over my head and just lay there.'</p>
      <p>"It was very violent.</p>
      <p>"If they're willing to do that at 8.40 in the morning in broad daylight, they've no fear.</p>
      <p>"They were all in uniform so members of the public told the school, the lollipop man told the school."</p>
      <p>The mum believes the incident on Friday, November 15, was reported to Greater Manchester Police by the school, while she also reported it and the knife threat via 101 as well.</p>
      <p>But almost two weeks later, the mum says she's not heard anything.</p>
      <p>"I've not had a phone call, I've not spoken to a police officer, neither has my son," she said.</p>
      <p>"I'm very disappointed in the police response."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the mum says the leadership team at Priestnall School will not reveal what action, if any, has been taken against the perpetrators 'due to GDRP'.</p>
      <p>The General Data Protection Regulation came into force last May and was designed to protect the personal information of individuals.</p>
      <p>It has caused a number of disputes between citizens and public bodies, especially schools.</p>
      <p>We reported in September <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/silly-school-rule-data-protection-16902659">how a school in Rochdale said a boy had to be called 'Harry2' in order to comply with GDPR rules.</a></p>
      <p>But in this case, the mum believes Priestnall's approach means she doesn't feel reassured that her son is safe to return to school.</p>
      <p>"Due to GDPR, the school can't tell me anything," the mum said.</p>
      <p>"They've not told my son what's happened to these boys.</p>
      <p>"He's had threats on his phone, someone saying 'we're going to punch your face in at school'.</p>
      <p>"We've kept him off and all we've had is a phone call from the school saying 'we're putting measures in place'.</p>
      <p>"He's just meant to put on a brave face and go into school. It's shocking.</p>
      <p>"To top it all off the police haven't even phoned me.</p>
      <p>"We feel very let down by the system.</p>
      <p>"He's already missed a week of school and if I send him back in I wonder if I'm going to get a call that he's been stabbed or beaten again?</p>
      <p>"We're really worried - do I buy him a stab vest to send him into school?</p>
      <p>"He was very lucky this time but what about the next?</p>
      <p>"These two bullies did it in a leafy suburb, in front of everyone, they're not scared."</p>
      <p>Asked for a response to the mum's claims, Priestnall School insists it has followed 'established procedures and processes' in dealing with the incident.</p>
      <p>The mum says not having spoken to Greater Manchester Police about the incident has made things more difficult.</p>
      <p>"I know there's been cuts and they're under staffed," she said.</p>
      <p>"But two weeks is ridiculous."</p>
      <p>The mum has now made an official complaint to GMP about the length of time she has had to wait for a response.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Priestnall School said: "The school are aware of the incident that took place outside of school hours and we have fully co-operated with the police as required.Â </p>
      <p>"We have followed established procedures and processes in supporting all those concerned and will continue to do so."</p>
      <p>GMP has not responded to the M.E.N's request for comment.</p>
