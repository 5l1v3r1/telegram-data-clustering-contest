      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP) in Italy expanded by 0.1% on a quarterly basis in the third quarter and came in at 0.3% on a yearly basis with both readings matching analysts' estimates and the preliminary estimates, the data published by Italy's national statistics bureau, ISTAT, showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The shared currency failed to capitalize on the data and the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> pair was last seen trading at 1.1002, losing 0.05% on a daily basis.</p>
