      <p><b>L'Equipe:</b> "The score is severe. Celtic, assured of finishing first in the group, scored three goals for six shots on target. Lewis Morgan opened the scoring after a magnificent collective move (21st), three minutes after a first alert of Olivier Ntcham (18th), then Ryan Christie doubled the bet on a hit that bounced off Édouard Mendy (45 + 1) ). Finally, Michael Johnston took advantage of an inspiration from Ntcham to score a third goal (74th), which is a bit harsh. Car Rennes had several big chances (7th, 25th), including a Flavien Tait shot and a Jordan Siebatcheu post in the wake (57th), until Adrien Hunou's goal late in the game (89th).</p>
      <p><b>Maxifoot:</b> "Dominated in all compartments of the game, the Breton club has lived a hell in Scotland. Celtic gave Rennes a nice lesson in football. Strolled from start to finish, despite a slight improvement after the break, Julien Stéphan's men fell to Celtic Glasgow (3-1), this Thursday, on the 5th day of the group stage. A mediocre performance that confirms the difficulties."</p>
      <p><b>Ouest France</b>: "Supporters Rennais and Scots have shared throughout the meeting in a good atmosphere. The 2,700 Rennais who made the trip even celebrated the second goal of Celtic Glasgow scored by Ryan Christie (45 + 1 '). Already well received in the first leg at Roazhon Park, the Celtic fans have made the gesture to Rennes who will certainly spend a long night in the bars of Glasgow accompanied by the famous Guinness."</p>
      <p><b>Jeunes Footeux:</b> "Defeated on the field of Celtic Glasgow (3-1), the Stade Rennais who was already certain to be eliminated from the Europa League before this fifth day, is now guaranteed to finish in the last place of the group. A very sad European campaign after a very successful 2018/2019 exercise."</p>
      <p><b>France Football: </b>"Without necessarily being brilliant, Celtic has been able to be more realistic. On the first big situation of his, Morgan opened the mark of a nice strike of the left (21st). And Mendy, who had to work on two strikes Ntcham (18th, 27th), could not do anything on that of Christie (45th + 1). Mass was said."</p>
      <p><b>Footmercato: </b>"More than the result, it is the content of the opposition benefit that leaves a bitter taste. The Rennes coach regretted it in a post-match press conference. 'We had undeniable shortcomings. To play this kind of opposition, we have limits,' he acknowledged very sincerely. This does not prevent the local press, Ouest-France in this case, from massacring the manager and the young team he had chosen to line up in Scotland."</p>
