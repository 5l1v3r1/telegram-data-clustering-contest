      <p>Jurors were shown graphic images of the crime scene during the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/topic/murder/">murder</a> trial.</p>
      <p>Claire's devastated mother Heather wept as the footage was played in court showing her slain daughter lying on her back with head injuries in her flat.</p>
      <p>The savage attack -which only last 90 seconds - took place at Donald's flat at Rintoul Avenue, Blairhall, near Dunfermline on October 5, last year.</p>
      <p>The callous killer claimed he snapped after Claire made sexual advances to his girlfriend - Laura McMurdo, 30.</p>

      <p>Sentencing him at the High Court in Glasgow Lady Scott told Donald: “Claire Donald was a deeply loving woman known to be friendly and caring.</p>

      <p>“You brutally took her life. You have left her young children her partner and her family without her.</p>
      <p>“You had never met her before that day and launched a savage and frenzied attack when she was in the flat and struck her repeatedly with a hammer at least eight times.</p>
      <p>“The reason for this attack is not clear. You said she was disrespecting you.</p>
      <p>“You present a very real risk of serious harm to the public. However, it is up to the parole board when you are released.”</p>
      <blockquote>It shouldnae have happened. I’m no monster like folk make out."<cite>Aaron Donaldmurderer</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Donald was ordered to serve at least 18 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>As he was led away to the cells members of Claire's family shouted: “Enjoy”, “eighteen years with his record,” and “it's not enough.”</p>
      <p>Claire suffered multiple skull fractures in the horrific attack.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Donald has 50 previous convictions, including seven for violence.</p>

      <p>Defence QC Bert Kerrigan said: “Mr Donald has shown significant remorse. He has a history of psychiatric problems.”</p>
      <p>During the trial Paul Smith, 36, said he got a phone call from Donald shortly after he had killed Claire and added: “He was telling me he’d done something real bad, something a bit crazy.</p>
      <p>“He told me he’d killed a woman. I said ‘Are you sure she’s dead?’</p>
      <p>“He said: ‘Oh aye. She’s dead. I hit her a number of times with a hammer and there’s brain matter everywhere.’”</p>
      <p>Mr Smith also said in a statement to police: “Aaron told me that the girl had tried it on with Laura and tried touching her and then he said: ‘I lost it and battered her to death’.”</p>
      <p>During his trial brazen Donald admitted killing Claire, but claimed he was suffering from diminished responsibility at the time.</p>
      <p>The jury rejected this and convicted him of murder.</p>
      <p>In evidence Donald said: “It shouldnae have happened. I’m no monster like folk make out.</p>
      <p>“I can’t take back what I done.”</p>
      <p>He also claimed he could not get Claire's death out of his mind and said: “I honestly lost the plot.”</p>
      <p>Tragic Claire's baby girl Violet-Ivy died at a flat in Cupar, Fife, in 2016 when aged just three-weeks old. She has another child of primary school age.</p>
