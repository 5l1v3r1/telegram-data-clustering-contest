      <h1>CAA website besieged by angry drone pilots ahead of registration deadline</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:00:59+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Booth</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of UK drone pilots could face a fine of £1,000 if they fail to register their details with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) by the end of today.</p>
      <p>Drone users blasted the regulator on Twitter today, complaining that its website was repeatedly crashing as users rushed to register.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Toby Stripp said: “@UK_CAA your drone registration service is down. Hope you won’t be dishing out any £1k fines when people can’t register huh?”</p>

      <p>Mark Brookfield posted a picture of an error message on the CAA’s website and said: “@UK_CAA ‘You must register your drone by the end of 29 November, or else’</p>
      <p>“Also CAA: ‘we’re so bloody incompetent we can’t run a decent IT system'”. </p>

      <p>Rob Mynott said: “@UK_CAA I have just tried to register my drone, but having both taken and passed the test the website crashed as I was trying to make payment. What do you suggest I do?”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the CAA said: “We are trying to establish what the problem is.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with a drone which weighs more than 250g must register it with the CAA by midnight tonight.</p>

      <p>The operator must be over 18, take an online multiple choice test and pay a £9 fee.</p>
      <p>The new regulation follows scares such as the disruption of Gatwick Airport last December.</p>
      <p>Last year thousands of passengers faced delays and the army was called in after multiple drone sightings near Gatwick Airport. </p>
      <p>In April, an Airbus passenger jet carrying as many as 186 passengers was forced to take evasive action to avoid a drone as it approached Gatwick airport.</p>
      <p>The airliner was flying at 518 metres towards the West Sussex airport on 28 April when the pilot saw a dark-coloured drone and made a banking turn to the right of up to eight degrees to avoid the device, according to the UK Airprox Board (UKAB).</p>
