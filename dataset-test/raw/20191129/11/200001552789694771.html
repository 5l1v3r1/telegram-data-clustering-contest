      <h1>“I guarantee we’d have won” – Defeat to Rangers stands out as bitter point in career</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:33:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Rangers managed to get a 2-2 draw away to Feyenoord on Thursday evening, a result which sees Steven Gerrard’s side top of their Europa League group.</p>
      <p>The Dutch club took the lead, before Ryan Kent set up Alfredo Morelos for the equaliser. Before that, Allan McGregor had helped keep Rangers in it, but not long after they drew level Morelos put them ahead, converting a cross from Borna Barisic.</p>
      <p>Feyenoord managed to make it 2-2, and Gerrard was left frustrated after the match.</p>
      <p>Rangers have qualification in their own hands, and should they manage it then the dreaming will begin. It’s eleven years since the Ibrox club were in the UEFA Cup Final, losing 2-0 to Zenit, and whilst it feels like a much harder task in the new version of the competition, hopes of a similar run will still bring excitement.</p>
      <p>To get to the final against the Russian club, Rangers beat Fiorentina on penalties in the semi-final, after both legs finished 0-0. In goal for the Italian club was Sebastien Frey, and it’s a match he’ll never forget for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Radio Toscana, in comments picked up by <a href="https://www.fiorentina.it/frey-rimpianto-piu-grande-la-semifinale-coi-rangers-jovetic-talento-inespresso-ribery/">Fiorentina.it</a>, the now retired goalkeeper picked the game as a bitter point in his career: “<i>It would have been a dream to say that I had won something with Fiorentina, I believe that in those years we would not have stolen anything. This is why I was particularly disappointed with the Rangers match. If we had arrived in the final that year, I guarantee we’d have won.”</i></p>
