      <h1>Today's the last day to pick up free youth bus passes before Victoria program starts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:47:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Bell</a></address>
      <p>Today is the final day to pick up a free youth bus pass from the City of Victoria before the program kicks in Sunday, although they can still be obtained afterward.</p>
      <p>Victoria youth 18 and younger are eligible for the passes, which Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps hopes will spur a new generation of transit riders.</p>
      <p>Part of the funding for the program is coming from Sunday parking fees that took effect in May. The fees are expected to generate about $500,000 to $600,000 a year.</p>
      <p>The passes can be picked up at Victoria City Hall from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m on weekdays.</p>
      <h3>About the passes</h3>

        <li>Each monthly pass provides unlimited rides on B.C. Transit buses and handyDART (for registered handyDART customers)</li>
        <li>Proof of age and residency is required each time you pick up a pass</li>
        <li>No replacement transit passes will be issued for lost or stolen cards</li>
