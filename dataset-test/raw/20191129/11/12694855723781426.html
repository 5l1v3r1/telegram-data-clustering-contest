        <b>eBay is offering one of the finest </b>
        <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s">
          <b>Xbox One S</b>
        </a>
        <b> bundles we’ve seen yet, kicking off the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-28-11-3958979">Black Friday</a> bargain celebrations with a massive bang. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The retailer is offering the Xbox One S Digital Edition with three excellent games for the potentially criminal price of just £99. That’s under one hundred notes for a console with ample storage for digital downloads of the latest titles. </p>
      <p>We continually check thousands of prices to show you the best deals. If you buy a product through our site we will earn a small commission from the retailer – a sort of automated referral fee – but our reviewers are always kept separate from this process. You can read more about how we make money in our <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/info/trusted-reviews-ethics-policy-3521647#how-we-make-money">Ethics Policy.</a></p>
      <p>Players who pick up the console will also receive the following selection of games: Minecraft, Forza Horizon 3 and Sea of Thieves. We’ve seen a similar bundle do the rounds before, but seldom at such a low price. Even without a drive for physical discs, this is still well worth a punt. </p>
      <p>Boasting a saving of £100, the digital iteration of Xbox One S was introduced earlier this year as an alternative for consumers who prefer digital downloads. It’s a great way of taking advantage of services such as <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/xbox-game-pass-2947834">Xbox Game Pass</a>, and you can always expand memory with external drives, too. </p>
      <p>The finest game of the package is definitely <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/forza-horizon-3">Forza Horizon 3</a>, a fantastic open-world racer set in the sunny plains of Australia. “This game gets my heart rate going like no other racer. It captures the childish glee of playing with toy cars and combines it with the adrenaline of throwing yourself around in a very expensive hunk of metal,” reads our 5/5 review.</p>
