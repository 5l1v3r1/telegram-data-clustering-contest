      <p><b>Thiruvananthapuram:</b> Vanchiyoor police filed a case against 12 lawyers in Kerala for threatening a magistrate after she refused bail to an accused. They allegedly closed the door of her chamber and intimidated her, sources said. <br/><br/>The judicial first class magistrate in Thiruvananthapuram, Deepa Mohan, in her complaint on Wednesday said that the lawyers threatened her for not granting bail to a driver of a state-run bus. <br/><br/>"You happen to be a woman. Otherwise we would've dragged you out of the chamber and kicked you," the accused allegedly said. <br/><br/>The accused included office-bearers of the Thiruvananthapuram bar association namely, advocates KP Jayachandran and Pachalloor Jayakrishnan. <br/><br/>Sources said that the accused assailed Mohan after she denied bail to the driver on the charge of intimidating a witness. <br/><br/><br/>The police on Thursday reportedly charged them with preventing the magistrate from discharging her duties, for rioting inside the courtroom, criminally intimidating the magistrate and confining her wrongfully for nearly two hours. <br/><br/>In the wake of the incident, the judicial officers have sought protection from the High Court from violent activities, intimidation, threat of boycott and humiliation at the hands of the Bar. Meanwhile, a group of lawyers boycotted court on Friday. Police protection has been extended to the court campus and judicial officers in the wake of the incident. <br/><br/><br/>Untitled Carousel</p>
