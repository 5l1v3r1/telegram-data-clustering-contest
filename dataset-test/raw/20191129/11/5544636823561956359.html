      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr has threatened to beat Anthony Joshua “even faster” in their upcoming rematch, saying that the Brit fought “something he’s never seen before” in their first meeting.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr also believes Joshua will aim to regain the IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight championships next Saturday by adopting a cautious in-ring strategy.</p>
      <p>“I’m expecting that. But if he wants to bang, it’s better for me. I love to bang because that’s the fighter that I am,” Ruiz Jr told Sky Sports, six months after flooring Joshua four times and completing a memorable shock.</p>
      <p>“December 7 we have to pressure, work the body, break him down. Especially his mentality.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to see where he’s at because all the pressure is on him. The pressure isn’t on me because I followed my dream, made my dreams come true.</p>
      <p>“Of course I want more – I want the legacy of Andy Ruiz Jr.”</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr had previously explained that his sparring partners were being “slick” in anticipation of Joshua trying to be elusive.</p>
      <p>“People haven’t seen me cut off the ring,” Ruiz Jr warned. “I actually break them down even faster when they try to box me around.</p>
      <p>“We all have a plan until we get hit, like Mike Tyson would say. I’m pretty sure he will want to box me around.</p>
      <p>“One punch can change the fight. That’s what happened on June 1. It might be a little harder than the first time. I’ve got to show my skills, my talent.”</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr’s only defeat in 34 fights came via majority decision to Joseph Parker in 2016, a verdict he still disputes. He insists that his style will always be a problem for Joshua.</p>
      <p>“Especially me staying small. I don’t think he likes fighting [against that style],” Ruiz Jr explained. “I don’t think he’s ever fought a short guy that pressures and is pretty slick.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I was boxing him around even though I was the shorter guy. I was counter-punching him. When he would throw, I would throw back with more punches.</p>
      <p>“He saw something that he’s never seen before.</p>
      <p>“People said before, who would you rather fight: Joshua, Deontay Wilder or Tyson Fury? I always said Joshua because of his style.</p>
      <p>“Styles make fights. His style was perfect for me to become the unified heavyweight champion.”</p>
