      <h1>Batman Swapped With Catwoman in Arkham Knight Is Pure Nightmare Fuel</h1>

      <p>The Internet has done the unspeakable to <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman-arkham-knight/">Batman: Arkham Knight</a></i>.</p>
      <p>A gamer uploaded a video on YouTube that's been modified so that Batman and Catwoman's skins are swapped. This gives us the hellish and hilarious image of an increasingly sexy Batman, in possession of Grey DeLisle's sultry voice, in stark contrast to the stoic Catwoman speaking with the deep tones of Kevin Conroy.</p>

      <p>Video game mods can often be an easy source of comedy (take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAe7iPtoIH8"><i>Harry Potter</i> mod of <i>Grand Theft Auto</i></a> or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRMVS7uTquk"><i>Teletubbies </i>version of <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i></a>), but rarely has a simple switch caused such an easily entertaining romp. The video is about 10 minutes long and includes both gameplay and cutscenes (including an extensive one at the end, which features Catwoman in her classic TV Julie Newmar costume).</p>
      <p><i>Batman: Arkham Knight</i> was released in 2015 to both critical and commercial success, capping off the excellent run of <i>Arkham </i>games that began with <i>Batman: Arkham Asylum </i>6 years earlier. <i>Arkham Knight</i> would prove to be the last main game in the series before making way for <i>Batman: The Telltale Series</i> and <i>Batman: The Enemy Within</i>. Nevertheless, it's nice to see fans are still finding ways to squeeze new enjoyment out of the popular franchise.</p>
