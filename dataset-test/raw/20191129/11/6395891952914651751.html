      <p>More arrests are expected as the Tucson Police Department works in concert with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel to continue unraveling the “sophisticated” smuggling operation, the <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/112619_ups_smuggling/tucson-cops-feds-roll-up-ups-ring-trafficking-potentially-deadly-thc-vape-pens/">Tucson Sentinel</a> reported.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ups-employees-allegedly-ran-massive-drug-shipment-operation-evading-authorities-for-a-decade/2019/11/27/00f432e8-10cb-11ea-bf62-eadd5d11f559_story.html">The Washington Post</a>, four UPS employees – including two supervisors and two drivers – are among those arrested to date, and 49-year-old Mario Barcelo is believed to be the ringleader. Authorities believe Barcelo, a dispatch supervisor who had worked for the shipping giant for 20 years, obscured the origin and destination of drug shipments, creating a pipeline stretching from the southwest to the U.S. East Coast.</p>
      <p>Among the products and proceeds seized during the stealthy two-week sting were 50,000 counterfeit THC vape pens, commercial-grade equipment used to manufacture the concentrated extracts used in the pens, cash and more than one dozen vehicles, including a Chevrolet Corvette, Ford Raptor trucks and a Range Rover, ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts-O'Keefe <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/112619_ups_smuggling/tucson-cops-feds-roll-up-ups-ring-trafficking-potentially-deadly-thc-vape-pens/">told the Tucson Sentinel</a>.</p>

      <p>Sgt. William Kaderly with the Tucson Police Department <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ups-employees-allegedly-ran-massive-drug-shipment-operation-evading-authorities-for-a-decade/2019/11/27/00f432e8-10cb-11ea-bf62-eadd5d11f559_story.html">told The Post</a> the drug ring shipped several thousand pounds of drugs per week during peak operation, with profits soaring the farther east the shipments landed.</p>
      <p>“Their sales pitch was that because of who Barcelo was at UPS, he could make sure your package will make it out without anyone finding it,” Kaderly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ups-employees-allegedly-ran-massive-drug-shipment-operation-evading-authorities-for-a-decade/2019/11/27/00f432e8-10cb-11ea-bf62-eadd5d11f559_story.html">told The Post</a>, adding, “He had face time with traffickers.”</p>
      <p>In addition to Barcelo, the men arrested include:<br/>•    Fernando Navarro-Figueroa, 32<br/>•    Raul Garcia Cordova, 47<br/>•    Abraham Felix-Navarro, 27<br/>•    Heriberto Martinez-Bojorquez, 24<br/>•    Thomas Mendoza, 47<br/>•    Victor Molina, 32<br/>•    Michael Castro, 34<br/>•    Jonathan Gallegos, 26<br/>•    Gary Love, 40<br/>•    Martin Siqueiros, 31</p>
      <p>Pitts-O’Keefe confirmed to the <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/112619_ups_smuggling/tucson-cops-feds-roll-up-ups-ring-trafficking-potentially-deadly-thc-vape-pens/">Tucson Sentinel</a> the men face charges for drug possession, drug possession for sale, money laundering and conspiracy. At least one of those arrested also faces weapons charges, she said.</p>
