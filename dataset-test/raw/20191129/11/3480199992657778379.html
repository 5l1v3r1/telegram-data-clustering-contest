      <p>As of Sunday, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will be replaced by Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen at the head of the EU executive, and Belgium’s Charles Michel will succeed Donald Tusk as EU Council president and chair the summits of EU leaders.</p>
      <p>Mr Michel and Mr Tusk warmly hugged one another at EU headquarters during the handover ceremony from the Polish Christian Democrat to the free-market liberal former Belgian prime minister.</p>
