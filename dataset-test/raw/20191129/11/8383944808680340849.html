      <h1>Turkish financial sector buys 85.05% stake in JCR Eurasia</h1>

      <p>Turkey's leading banking and financial institutions inked a deal to buy 85.05% of credit rating agency JCR Eurasia, Turkey's banking association said on Friday.<br/><br/>Borsa Istanbul will hold 18.5% of the company, while Japan Credit Rating Agency will hold 14.95%. Turkish private and state lenders, including Ziraat Bank, Garanti BBVA, YapÄ± Kredi will also hold stakes in the company with 2.86%, said a statement by The Banks Association of Turkey (TBB).</p>
      <p>The Financial Institutions Association, Turkey's Capital Markets Association and the Insurance and Reinsurance Union will each hold 6% of the company. Rather than rating sovereign debt and banks in Turkey, the agency will continue to evaluate Turkish companies, Reuters said on Friday.<br/><br/>According to the association, the new partnership will determine the credit worthiness of companies wishing to borrow from financial markets, which would help financial resources to be used more efficiently.<br/><br/>The plan could be considered a "tangible step" taken by Turkey in setting up a "national credit rating agency."<br/><br/>For a long time, Turkey has criticized international rating agencies, saying they might be subjective and perform non-transparent evaluations from time to time, resulting in an unfair decrease in confidence in some countries' economies.</p>
