      <p>The rush to secure the best <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> deals and bargains has begun, with shoppers getting up before dawn and queuing outside certain <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/are-supermarkets-and-shops-open-early-or-late-on-black-friday-11235183/">stores in the early hours</a> to be the first to shop the offers.</p>
      <p>Stores have slashed the prices across a range of products, from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/29/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019-tech-vacuum-11235278/">HD TVs and vacuums</a> to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/27/best-smartphone-black-friday-deals-iphone-android-price-cuts-2019-11225915/">mobile phones</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/asos-top-deals-black-friday-2019-11225361/">fashion</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/29/tesco-black-friday-deals-kitchen-appliances-prosecco-11235908/">prosecco</a>.</p>
      <p>Supermarkets including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lidl/">Lidl</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/waitrose/">Waitrose</a> are offering Black Friday bargains for their customers and with some offers only available in-store, here is when you can go and browse the deals for yourself.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday opening times for Aldi, Lidl, Waitrose and Co-op</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Aldi</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aldi/">Aldi</a> is going to be open as normal today and across the weekend with no special opening hours for Friday 29 November as the supermarket isn’t putting on any specific Black Friday deals.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Some may argue this could be for the best, after the store’s recent release of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/aldis-limited-edition-kevin-the-carrot-toys-are-now-on-sale-11208769/">Kevin the Carrot merchandise</a> – associated with their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/aldis-peaky-blinders-themed-christmas-sees-kevin-carrot-hot-water-11048678/">Christmas TV advert</a> – led to thousands queuing for the chance to get their hands on the toys, with some <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/thousands-adults-shove-aldi-get-kevin-carrot-11234377/">shoppers even seen ‘fighting’ to get the products</a> before they sold out.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Lidl</b>
      </p>
      <p>Known for their affordable fare and great value offerings year-round, Black Friday will be no exception for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/lidl-black-friday-deals-2019-11195355/">Lidl, who have a multitude of deals on sale</a> today.</p>
      <p>As with all of their ‘Middle of Lidl’ sales, the products will only be available in store and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/16/lidl-announces-15000000000-investment-uk-supermarkets-10928758/">the supermarket chain</a> are emphasising that: ‘When it’s gone…it’s gone’. They will also be implementing a ‘first-come, first-served’ system in-store and have warned: ‘ticketed queuing may be used.’</p>
