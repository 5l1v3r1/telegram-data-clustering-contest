      <p>On Tuesday, November 26, the popular video community Youtube celebrated Afrobeats with the announcement of four selected Nigerian artists to receive support on their individual music journey.</p>
      <p>The event themed ‘<i>A celebration of Afrobeats</i>’ which took place at the Lagos Waterways, LASWA yard, Falomo Jetty, Ikoyi, unveiled Kizz Daniel, Reekado Banks, Simi, and Teniola Apata as its selected artists. Although Kizz Daniel couldn’t make it to the event, Teni, Simi and Reekado Banks made the fireside chat with Akah Nnani (the host) worth the evening.</p>
      <p>These four artists would be provided the needed support and tools to advance their musical career while also growing their YouTube presence to market them globally.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Guardian TV on this, Addy Awofisayo, content and partnership executive at YouTube Nigeria said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>We are going to give them [the artists] training, marketing and promotional support to help them amplify their music and connect their music with fans around the world</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This development, according to Youtube, was in fulfillment of its earlier promise to support the country’s Afrobeats talents during the Google for Nigeria event in July, where it declared support for 10 emerging artists through Mr. Eazi’s emPawa program.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it was also a night of revelations as Reekado Banks opened up about working towards releasing an album in 2020, he said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Expect an album next year… it depends on the ginger, but, expect an EP before the end of the year too.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Overall, it turned out to be an interesting night of networking and music with a lot to eat and drink.</p>
