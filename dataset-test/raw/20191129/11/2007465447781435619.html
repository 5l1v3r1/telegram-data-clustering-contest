      <h1>2020 BMW Z4 receives the AC Schnitzer treatment</h1>
      <h2>AC Schnitzer has made the all-new Z4 sharper, more powerful</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:30:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, we saw one of Germany's top tuners modify the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/toyota-gr-supra-gets-magic-touch-from-bmw-tuner-ac-schnitzer.html">all-new Toyota Supra</a>. While it may come as a surprise, the new A90 Supra is essentially a BMW Z4 wearing a different type of suit. Still, that did not stop the tuning house in making the already good-looking coupe, look and perform better than stock.</p>

      <p>Not long after however, AC Schnitzer has modified yet another car, only this time it's much closer to home. Fresh from tweaking the new Supra, the company has now turned their attention to its twin, the BMW Z4. Like its hardtop Japanese counterpart, AC Schnitzer did a number on BMW's newest roadster.</p>
      <p>Using an M40i as a base, AC Schnitzer tuned the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six to produce more power and torque. From 382 PS with 500 Nm, the tuned Z4 now puts out 400 PS and 600 Nm of torque. Complementing the upgraded inline-six are a plethora of exhaust silencers that further beef up the engine's rich sound.</p>

      <p>As for the body itself, the droptop can be fitted with a front splitter, side skirts, rear diffuser, and a subtle two-piece rear spoiler. A choice of 20-inch forged alloy wheels are available for the Z4 as well. They come in two styles and in two finishes; silver anthracite and bicolor. Like the A90 Supra, AC Schnitzer opted to give the Z4's a cabin discrete makeover courtesy of aluminum pedals, footrest, and paddle shifters.</p>
      <p>Power is useless without agility, so AC Schnitzer also released a new spring kit that will work alongside the Z4's adaptive dampers. It can lower ride height by 15 â€“ 25mm, and was developed to improve the Z4's handling and riding comfort too.</p>

      <p>Like what you see? You can contact AC Schnitzer directly and tell them you're interested in getting the upgrades. The only question now is which more do you prefer, the AC Schnitzer A90 Supra or the G29 Z4?</p>
