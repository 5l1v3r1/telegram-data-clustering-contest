      <h1>One-pot chicken with dates and caramelised lemon recipe </h1>

      <p>Chicken that is both nearly-fall-apart tender and deeply golden brown. It can be cooked a few hours ahead, then kept in the casserole at room temperature. If you wish to reheat it before serving, pop it in the oven without a lid on for 10-15 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>four to six </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>a 1.8kg chicken, or 1.25kg bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or legs</li>
        <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut into thick slices crossways, seeds removed</li>
        <li>2 shallots, halved lengthways</li>
        <li>4-6 Medjool dates, pitted</li>
        <li>4 thyme or oregano sprigs, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground Urfa chilli, or 1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>flaky sea salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220C/ 200C fan/gas mark 7.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large, flame-proof casserole dish over a medium-high heat. Place the chicken in the pot, breast-side up. Using tongs, press lightly to make sure the skin comes into even contact with the bottom of the pot (if using parts, just sear the chicken skin-side down). Cook, without moving it, until the chicken is nice and browned, five to eight minutes. No peeking!</li>
        <li>Add the lemon and shallot, manoeuvring the chicken so the lemon slices come into contact with the bottom of the pot. Let everything sizzle until lightly caramelised, about two minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the dates, herbs and 250ml water. Sprinkle the top of the chicken with chilli and place the lid on. Transfer to the oven and roast until the dates are plump, the lemon slices are jammy, and the chicken is almost but not totally cooked through, 20-25 minutes. (The chicken will look mostly cooked through and a little anaemic from having been covered.)</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and drizzle the chicken with the remaining olive oil. Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half and the top of the chicken is a glistening golden brown, another 20-30 minutes (depending on whether you’re using parts or a whole bird).</li>
        <li>Let the chicken rest in the pot for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board and carve. Serve alongside the shallot, lemon slices and dates, with more herbs and flaky salt sprinkled over.</li>
      </ol>
