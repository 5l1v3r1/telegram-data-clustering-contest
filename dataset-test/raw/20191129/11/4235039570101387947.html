      <p>Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, wrote a daily editorial on Politico on his last business day, according to BGNES.</p>
      <p>In it, Juncker takes a backward glance at the weaknesses and successes of his five-year term as head of the European executive branch.</p>
      <p>"If Europe's strength is to be a trusted partner, someone who can be counted on to defend a global order based on multilateral rules, our weakness is that we do not keep our promises - ours and those of our international allies. The best example is our enlargement policy and the <b>shameful</b> inability of European leaders to keep their promises to start accession negotiations with <b>Northern Macedonia</b> and <b>Albania</b>, once these governments have fulfilled the necessary criteria. Respect must be earned and if we want to maintain confidence in us, we must do what we said we would do - inside and out," Juncker wrote in his farewell comment.</p>
