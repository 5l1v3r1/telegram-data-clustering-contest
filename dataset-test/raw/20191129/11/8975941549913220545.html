      <h1>Huawei prepares lawsuit to fight against FCC restrictions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:10:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Strumpf</a></address>
      <p>Huawei Technologies Co. has decided to fight a Federal Communications Commission decision last week that further curtails its business with some of its few remaining customers in the U.S., as it continues to advocate for itself in an escalating battle with Washington, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The company is preparing a lawsuit that would challenge the decision—part of a broad recent effort by Huawei of more forcefully challenging U.S. efforts to restrict its business. In March, Huawei sued the U.S. government in a Texas federal court to block the enforcement of provisions of a 2019 defense policy law that prevents the U.S. government and contractors from using Huawei telecom equipment.</p>
      <p>The company has also drastically increased its spending on Washington lobbyists and has engaged in a public-relations makeover. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, 75 years old, has shed his reclusive image and become a virtual celebrity CEO. The former Chinese army engineer has appeared in Huawei-sponsored fireside chats and sat for numerous interviews.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this month, he said his company “can survive very well without the U.S.” Huawei is the world’s largest maker of telecom gear and the No. 2 vendor of smartphones, behind only Samsung Electronics Co. and ahead of Apple Inc.</p>
