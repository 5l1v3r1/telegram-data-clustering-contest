      <h1>‘Kammuri’ least likely to be super typhoon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:30:10+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/melnie-ragasa-jimena" target="_blank">Melnie Ragasa-Jimena</a></address>
      <h3>THE Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa)  said in  yesterday’s 11 a.m. forecast  the possibility of “Typhoon Kammuri” turning into a super typhoon is least likely.</h3>
      <p>Pagasa said “Kammuri, ”  which is still outside the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) and as of now has no direct effect on the country,  has gained more strength while moving northwestward slowly at 170 kilometers per hour (kph).  It was last spotted 1,470 km east of Southern Luzon with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 170 kph.</p>
      <p>In a statement  on its official facebook page Dost_pagasa,  the weather bureau  denied news circulating online that “Kammuri ”will be hitting the country as a “super typhoon.”</p>
      <p>Pagasa explained that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) of the United States uses one minute as wind averaging period for the estimation of maximum sustained winds near the center (MSW), while PAGASA and other meteorological centers in the Western North Pacific use the WMO recommended 10-minute averaging period. Shorter wind averaging periods yield higher wind estimates compared to longer averaging period. As such, MSW from JTWC are generally higher than PAGASA and other major meteorological centers.</p>
      <p>Based on the latest  data, Pagasa said  “KAMMURI” (local name: Typhoon “TISOY”) is less likely to reach Super Typhoon category at this time, but this scenario is not yet ruled out as the Typhoon is forecast to steadily intensify before making landfall in Southern Luzon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Agriculture Secretary William D. Dar yesterday urged farmers in the Visayas and Bicol regions to harvest their crops immediately to prevent them from being severely damaged by  typhoon “Kammuri”</p>
      <p>Dar made the appeal following the advisory of Pagasa that the typhoon will enter the  PAR between tonight (Saturday evening) to Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>However, Dar said  in other cases, farmers can delay planting until the typhoon exits the PAR.</p>
      <p>Once in the PAR, the DOST-PAGASA  will raise tropical cyclone wind signal #1 over eastern Bicol and eastern Visayas regions.</p>
      <p>Dar also advised fishermen not to venture in the seas due to strong typhoon-induced ocean waves.</p>
      <p>Typhoon “Tisoy” is expected to intensify as it moves closer to Bicol and Eastern Visayas,  bringing scattered rains and thunderstorms. He added that farm and fishing grounds in said regions are therefore at risk.</p>
      <p>“Farmers, fishers, and other ruralfolk are advised to take precautions as advised by their respective local disaster risk reduction and management councils (DRRMCs),” Dar said.</p>
      <p>He instructed the respective DA-Regional Field Offices (RFOs) to enforce appropriate measures to minimize damage to crops, livestock, aquaculture and infrastructure facilities, including harm to farmers, fishers, other ruralfolk and their families.</p>
