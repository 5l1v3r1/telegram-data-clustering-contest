      <p>In what appears to be a journey to the next level, former <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">BBNaija</a> housemate, Gedoni has stated that his relationship with Khafi has got to a permanent site.</p>
      <p>He made this known during an interview with Broadway Tv during ‘The Future’ awards held on November 24.</p>
      <p>When asked about his relationship with Khafi, Gedoni excitingly said “It’s already in the permanent site”</p>
      <p>Perhaps, the Khadoni relationship is heading towards marriage, just like that of former housemates in the 2018 edition,<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/16/see-photos-video-from-teddy-a-bambams-white-wedding/"> Bambam and Teddy A who recently sealed their union with a white wedding ceremony</a> in Dubai.</p>

      <p>Even though there have always been rumours that Gedoni and Khafi’s relationship will never stand a test of time outside Big brother house, the lovebirds, in different scenarios proved people wrong.</p>
      <p>An instance was while the duo were in the gathering of other housemates and the UK metropolitan police officer described Gedoni as the ‘salt of her life’.</p>
      <p>Hearing this, the fashion designer went emotional as he burst into tears.</p>
      <p>Another lovely moment was when Gedoni penned down a mind-blowing message to celebrate Khafi on her birthday, earlier this month.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post, the fashion designer wrote “I went into BBNaija for something I thought I wanted, and came out with someone I needed (a partner, a support system, a friend, a sister; everything I didn’t even know I needed).”</p>
      <p>Recall that Gedoni and Khafi’s in-house relationship stirred much controversies on social media platforms, with their consequent raunchy moments.</p>
