      <h1>Is League of Legends’ next champion Sett? Some fans think so</h1>

        <b>Hot on the heels of the newest <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/leagueoflegends/best-league-legends-champion-beginners">League of Legends champions</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/senna">Senna</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/aphelios">Aphelios</a>‘ arrivals, fans are already guessing at who the next character to join the roster might be – and some believe they might have worked it out. A new loot asset heading to the game early next year has been leaked, and it points to a character called Sett.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.surrenderat20.net/2019/11/1127-pbe-update-loot-assets-skin-bios.html">Surrenderat20</a> (via <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/players-believe-sett-is-the-next-league-of-legends-champion">Dot Esports</a>) has revealed a loot asset called ‘Sett’s calling card’ that’s appeared in the game as part of the current <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/league-of-legends-patch-924">League of Legends patch 9.24</a> PBE testing cycle. This is reportedly “gained by impressing Sett. Openable on January 14, 2020 at 11:00 PT.”</p>
      <p>While this might not point to a new champion called Sett by itself, it follows developer Riot Games’ <a href="https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/10/champion-roadmap-october-2019/">announcement</a> last month that a “smokin’ hot new juggernaut” is in the works. Emerging from the Ionian underground, “this new champion will thrive in the centre of a brawl, laughing as they take hit after hit then furiously punching back, releasing all that stored aggression on their enemies’ faces.”</p>
      <p>The champion roadmap’s description of the juggernaut includes an <a href="https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/04_Teaser_Two_ywexcon0fojp7b6zndkq.jpg">image</a> of a gladiatorial-style arena, and in it you can see banners depicting what looks like a golden wolf’s head – pretty similar to Sett’s calling card, which you can see below:</p>

      <p>The other champion mentioned in the roadmap turned out to be marksman Aphelios, just arrived on the LoL PBE.</p>
      <p>It’s far from confirmed based on these clues, but perhaps the juggernaut could be Sett, and arrive in the game early next year – possibly as part of the game’s first 2020 season patch, due to arrive in January.</p>
      <p>We’ve reached out to Riot for comment and will update the story with any new information.</p>
