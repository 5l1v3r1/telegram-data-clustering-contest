      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> are in talks with Massimiliano Allegri and the Italian is open to replacing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> as manager, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s hierarchy have sacked Emery following the 2-1 defeat at home to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eintracht-frankfurt/">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are now seven games without a victory in all competitions, their worse run of form since February 1992.</p>
      <p>In a statement released on Friday morning, Arsenal said: ‘The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.’</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg, who was already part of Arsenal’s first-team coaching staff, has been named Emery’s replacement on an interim basis.</p>

      <p>According to Sky Sports, Arsenal have made contact with Allegri and the former Juventus manager has indicated that he would take the job.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old is currently out of work after leaving Juventus at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>Allegri has been living in London and has been learning English in preparation for a job in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, it was claimed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/26/massimiliano-allegri-doubts-arsenal-job-pressure-unai-emery-grows-11220202/">Allegri had doubts about taking the Arsenal job as he wants to join a club who are capable of winning the Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>Allegri won five Serie A titles during his time as Juventus manager and guided the Italian club to two Champions League finals, although he lost on both occasions.</p>
