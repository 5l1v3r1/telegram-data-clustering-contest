          <b>Aurora Cannabis (ACB) has been recovering on America's Thanksgiving holiday. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The technical picture has improved for the marijuana stock.</b>
        </li>

          <b>Fears about its financial situation may curb further gains.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Aurora Cannabis Incorporated</b>, which is headquartered in Edmonton and trades at the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) has risen on Thursday at and closed at $3.48. American traders were enjoying their Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
      <p>Low trading volume may have limited movement in the highly volatile stock and <b>Black Friday</b> may keep <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/volatility">volatility</a> at bay as well. Nevertheless, <b>cannabis stocks remain more active</b> than those in other sectors.</p>
      <h3>Aurora Stock Price Today</h3>
      <p>With its recent rise, <b>ACB has bottomed</b> out at $3.21, above the previous trough of exactly $3. Technically, the higher low is a <b>bullish sign</b> that may lead to an uptrend. On the other hand, <b>Aurora still trades below the highs</b> close to 4% seen in early November. </p>
      <p>The test comes on Black Friday, the last day of the month, which is prone to <b>portfolio adjustments</b>. As long as ACB holds up above $3.21, it maintains a high chance of extending the correction. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/aurora-cannabis-stock-price-debentures-upbeat-survey-keep-it-bid-outlook-cautiously-optimistic-201911211435">firm's financials</a> remain in focus as its <b>cash burn</b> continues growing. Aurora spent up to C$94.9 million to fund its operations in the third quarter, up 37% from the same period in 2018. The company had around C$152.5 million in cash or equivalents, causing it to <b>cancel the construction of two facilities</b>, including Aurora Sun. These savings may impede further growth adding to the company's woes. </p>
      <h4>Investing in Marijuana Stocks</h4>
      <p>On the other hand, Cantor Fitzgerald has reaffirmed its <b>bullish stance on the company</b>, especially when it relates to beating its peers in the pot sector, such as Canopy Growth Coro and Cronos Group. After <b>falling 70% in six months</b>, the analyst expects <b>higher growth for ACB over the competition</b>. </p>
      <p>Weed stocks have been extremely volatile of late, owing in part to news related to <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/marijuana-stocks-price-more-act-lifts-prices-from-lows-financials-still-weigh-201911201155">legalizing marijuana </a>on the federal level</b> in the US. Efforts by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives have met <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> at the Republican-held Senate. </p>
