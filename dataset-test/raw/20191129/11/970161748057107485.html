      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gary-rhodes/">Gary Rhodes</a>’ death has been called a ‘tragic natural event’ as a friend denied that the chef suffered a fall.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the star’s family <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/gary-rhodes-cause-death-confirmed-head-injury-11233553/">confirmed that the 59-year-old died from a subdural hematoma</a>, or a bleed on the brain, which is usually caused by a head injury.</p>
      <p>Now, Gary’s colleague and close friend of the Rhodes family Jaideep Bhatia has said that Gary did not slip and fall in the shower before dinner with his wife Jennie, when he collapsed.</p>
      <p>Bhatia, who is PR chief of the Grosnevor House Hotel Dubai, where Gary had a restaurant, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10448010/gary-rhodes-did-not-fall-in-the-shower-reveals-friend/">told The Sun</a>: ‘I can say categorically that Gary did not fall and was not injured. It was a tragic natural event and none of us can fight nature.’</p>

      <p>Saying that Gary had a ‘terrific’ day filming, Bhatia continued: ‘He showered before dinner – and did not fall while doing so – and had enjoyed a relaxed meal with his wife Jennie when it happened.’</p>

      <p>‘I have been in very close contact with the family at this difficult time and want to end speculation that he fell and hurt himself – he was not injured.</p>
      <p>‘The collapse was due to natural causes beyond anyone’s control and he died later in hospital despite efforts to save him.’</p>
      <p>It is unclear how Rhodes obtained the bleed.</p>

      <p>Bhatia’s comments come after Indian Michelin-starred chef <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/gary-rhodes-slipped-banged-head-death-aged-59-claims-close-friend-11232616/">Vineet Bhatia claimed that Gary had suffered a fall.</a></p>
      <p>The chef, who had filmed with Gary four days before his death, told the Mail Online: ‘I have been told by friends in Dubai that he slipped and banged his head and was then taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>‘I wish I could have been there for him. He was such a lovely man. So friendly and enjoying his life.’</p>
      <p>This followed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/27/jamie-oliver-leads-tributes-celebrity-chef-gary-rhodes-dies-aged-59-11225528/">Jamie Oliver’s suggestion that Rhodes had suffered a ‘tragic fall’</a>, as he wrote in an Instagram tribute: ‘Sadly Chef Gary Rhodes OBE passed away after a tragic fall. My heart felt sympathies to his wife, kids, friends and family, sending love and thoughts…’</p>
      <p>However, Jamie has since deleted ‘after a tragic fall’ from his Instagram post.</p>
