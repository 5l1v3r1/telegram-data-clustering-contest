      <p>A TIPPERARY MAN has been fined €800 and ordered to pay €1000 in costs over failing to safeguard the health and welfare of a Staffordshire bull terrier and her six puppies in October 2018.</p>
      <p>The case arose after an ISPCA inspector visited the property of Desmond Renehan in response to a report made to the charity’s National Animal Cruelty Helpline.</p>
      <p>ISPCA Inspector Alice Lacey found Minnie and her six puppies living in a shelter which was a “very small, dirty, smelly” concrete shed.</p>
      <p>“Minnie was in extremely poor body condition with ribs and hip bones protruding. She also had a pressure sore on her hind left leg and seemed unsteady on her feet. Her puppies showed signs of a heavy worm burden due to extremely distended bellies,” according to the ISPCA. </p>
      <p>The dog and her puppies were initially seized and taken for veterinary assessment.</p>
      <p>Upon assessment, Minnie weighed in at 20.7 kilograms, while the breed weight standard is 25-30 kilos.</p>
      <p>She also had a heavy flea infestation and multiple abrasions on her dry skin. The puppies also had evidence of a heavy parasite burden and flea infestation.</p>

      <p>Inspector Lacey said Minnie had no problem gaining weight after a few weeks in the care of the ISPCA.</p>
      <p>“She was extremely malnourished and was in a pitiful state when she came into the care of the ISPCA. After a couple of weeks of care, she had no trouble gaining weight. In fact, she gained seven kilos in just four weeks.</p>
      <p>On sentencing, Judge Elizabeth McGrath said she was not satisfied Renehan had taken enough responsibility for his dogs. </p>
      <p>“If you come before me again, I will be making a disqualification order. Those animals are your friends – look after them,” Judge McGrath said. </p>
      <p>Renehan was convicted of two offences in court yesterday under section 11 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. He had pleaded guilty to the charges at a previous court sitting but the matter was adjourned by Judge McGrath pending the submission of veterinary reports on a further two dogs that Renehan had in his possession.</p>
