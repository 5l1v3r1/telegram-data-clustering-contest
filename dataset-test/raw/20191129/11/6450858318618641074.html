      <h3>Best TV deals: What to look for</h3>
      <p>We recommend you buy a 4K TV. They’re sometimes called UHD or Ultra HD, but essentially they all mean 4K (3840x2160 pixels, which is four times that of Full HD) and will be capable of displaying 4K content that is set to be the future standard for TV shows, movies and games.</p>
      <p>At this high resolution, however, you also want to ensure that content at a lower resolution still looks sharp (for example, if you're streaming from your phone) when played on the TV screen. This is why it's also important to look out for a TV with a good upscaling engine.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about this in our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/mobile-phone/tv-buying-guide-everything-to-consider-when-buying-a-tv-3622259/">guide</a> that goes through everything you need to know when TV shopping. It also breaks down all the mysterious technical jargon and acronyms manufacturers use when describing TV specifications.</p>
      <p>We also recommend the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/digital-home/best-tv-2018-3652175/">best TVs to buy </a>(including advice on streaming 4K content, best viewing distance, and voice-activated smart TV features). If you can find one of these models on sale, so much the better.</p>
      <p>When shopping for a TV, look out for HDMI version 2 inputs with HDCP 2.2 support, which means the TV can handle 4K content sources such as Ultra HD Blu-ray players, games consoles and media streamers like the Nvidia Shield. HDCP 2.2 is the latest level of copy protection being used by all external 4K sources, so the more inputs that support it the better. These ports will also handle HDR content from your Xbox One or PS4 (and other sources). Ideally all HDMI inputs will meet this standard, but cheaper TVs may only have one such port.</p>
      <p>4K is best appreciated on a screen size of 55in or more, but there are smaller panels appearing and even a 4K TV at 40 inches can offer excellent performance. Make sure it's got enough HDMI ports for your set-top boxes, consoles and the like.</p>
      <p>Also see our round up of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/pc-peripheral/best-hdmi-cables-2018-3676960/">best HDMI cables</a>. Our article explains what to look for (and what to avoid!) when it comes to HDMI cable specs and features. Some of the cheaper cables can be just as effective as the more premium ones.</p>
      <p>(If you're really after a big picture though, you may want to look into getting a home projector - <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/pc-peripheral/best-projectors-home-cinma-3679888/">here are the best ones and what to look for when shopping for one</a>.)</p>
      <p>You might also see the acronym ‘HDR’ when you’re looking for a new TV. It stands for High Dynamic Range and offers higher peak whites and better colour depth. It’s not essential, but is a nice additional feature if the price is right. There isn’t much HDR content around yet, but like 4K we expect it to become more common over time.</p>
      <p>Of course, sound is another essential component when looking for a TV. As TVs get thinner, there's less space for large speakers capable of producing the rich sound quality we all expect to hear. This is where soundbars come in.</p>
      <p>We've created a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/audio/best-soundbars-2018-3673930/">separate in-depth guide just for soundbars</a>. It dives into the most important features to look for, whether you should get a separate subwoofer for a deeper bass, and of course the best soundbars on the market with respective reviews. </p>
      <h3>Where to find TV deals</h3>
      <p>You'll find TV deals from a huge number of retailers. If you found a model you like, we would also advise comparing the price against at least two to three other retailers and of course against Amazon if you haven't already.</p>
      <p>Some of the best bargains are often found on Amazon, especially if you look in the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/deals/ref=nav_cs_gb?ascsubtag=06-3664883-11-0000000">Deals of the Day</a>. These discounts offered for a limited time (often for a few hours only), or until stocks run out - they're also known as Lightning Deals.</p>
      <p>We'd recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/landing?ascsubtag=06-3664883-11-0000000">signing up to Amazon's 30 day free trial of Prime</a>, which will not only get you access to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/deals?ascsubtag=06-3664883-11-0000000">Lightning deals</a> 30 minutes earlier than non-Prime members, but will also get you free next-day delivery. Plus, you'll get access to Prime Video, which you can access through your smart TV, and other benefits during your trial, too.</p>
      <p>You can also expect to find TV deals from the following retailers:</p>

It offers several refurbished TVs at lower prices, but we would recommend only looking at ones that are marked <i>certified refurbished.</i></p>
      <h3>Best TV deals</h3>
      <h4>1. Philips 50PUS7304 50" 4K HDR Android TV with 3-sided Ambilight</h4>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-50PUS7304-12-50-Inch-Ambilight/dp/B07R4WK965/?ascsubtag=06-3664883-19-0000000">From: Amazon<br/>Was: £1000<br/>Now: £459  (£541 off) <br/>View Deal</a>
      </p>
      <p>With 3-sided Ambilight, this great Philips TV is a great deal at this price. It uses the P5 processor and has a T-bar mount which offers some swivel on this particular screen size.</p>
      <p>It's the entry-level Philips model with Android TV, so is a step up from cheaper models with Philips' own interface.</p>
      <h4>2. LG 55SM8200PLA 55in NanoCell 4K HDR TV</h4>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>LG's 2019 NanoCell TVs have some great discounts from the RRP at Currys. This is the 55in, but it's also available in 49in and 65in, and all are going at great prices for Cyber Monday. </p>
      <h4>3. LG 60UM7100PLB 60" Smart 4K HDR LED TV</h4>

      </p>
      <p>60 inches is an unusual size for a TV, but it might be exactly what you're looking for. And this is the lowest price this model has ever been.</p>
      <p>It's a 4K HDR TV with three HDMI inputs and LG's Web OS interface. It's also got built-in Freeview HD.</p>
      <h4>4. LG 43in Ultra HD 4K Smart TV with Freeview Play</h4>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>This isn't the absolute cheapest 43in 4K TV you can get, but you probably wouldn't want that anyway. With this LG you get good image quality, three HDMI inputs and features including built-in Google Assistant.</p>
