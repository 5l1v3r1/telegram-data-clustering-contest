      <h1>Manchester United manager Solskjaer claims Brandon Williams has benefited two teammates</h1>
      <h2>Brandon Williams was the only senior teenager who did not travel with the Man United squad to Astana and he could return to the XI vs Aston Villa.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Luckhurst, http://www.facebook.com/samuelluckhurstjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Brandon Williams' emergence has boosted <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> at both full-back positions, according to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/brandon-williams">Williams,</a> 19, was the only teenager rested for the Europa League trek to Astana in Kazakhstan after scoring his first United goal in the absorbing 3-3 draw with Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Left-back Williams has started five times for United already this term and his absence in Nur-Sultan allowed Luke Shaw to make his first appearance in 96 days after a hamstring injury. Solskjaer refused to say whether the returning Shaw would retain his place against Aston Villa on Sunday, with Ashley Young also available, and it is understood Shaw has been told he is no longer certain of a first-team status.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer nevertheless believes the competition from Williams is beneficial for Shaw and he has helped 18-year-old Ethan Laird, 18, impressive on his full debut at Astana, kick on. "I think the performances of Brandon have been a big, big plus. Not just for him, not just me, but for Ethan today, who's played with Brandon through the years.</p>
      <p>"So, for me, it's also a big boost for Ethan because we've got many, many full-backs, loads of them who compete. I've been very pleased with Brandon, he scored a great goal, so let's see where they're at.</p>
      <p>"Great to have Luke through 90 minutes today and let's see for Sunday."</p>
      <p>United host Villa in the first of nine games in December with more players set to return from injury shortly. Solskjaer has suggested Scott McTominay could be back at the weekend and Paul Pogba has an outside chance of making the squad for the visit of Jose Mourinho's Tottenham on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Axel Tuanzebe played his first 90-minute match since October 6 in Astana and spent last season on loan at Villa. "Axel could give the team talk, that’s for sure!" Solskjaer joked. "Axel has done fantastic, he got 90 minutes tonight and he got 10 minutes against Sheffield United as well.</p>
      <p>"He’s fit now and available and I thought he did well against Astana. He gives me another headache but it’s a good headache to have players coming back, because we have suffered with injuries badly. Now we’re getting more and more back and it will only help us.</p>
      <p>"I've watched Villa a few times, they were unlucky not to get away with the points against Liverpool and we're the only ones who've managed that, so we know how difficult that is. And I think they've done really well."</p>
