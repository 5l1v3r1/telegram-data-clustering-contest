      <h1>Hong Kong customs seizes $50 mln smuggled frozen meat to mainland China</h1>

      <p>BEIJING/HONG KONG, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong customs seized about 540 tonnes of suspected smuggled frozen meat with an estimated market value of about $50 million, the authority said in a statement on Friday, case of its kind in the past decade.</p>
      <p>The meat was found aboard four suspicious fishing vessels that were leaving Hong Kong, the customs authority said in a statement. Local broadcaster RTHK said the vessels were allegedly bound for mainland China.</p>
      <p>Meat prices in China hit a record high following an outbreak of African swine fever that swept through the country's pig herd. That makes meat smuggling more profitable than at any time in the past.</p>
      <p>Six men aged between 52 and 64 were arrested, according to Hong Kong customs. But the statement did not specify what meat the six men were smuggling.</p>
      <p>To ensure supplies in the market, China has been increasing meat imports, with pork arrivals in October doubled from a year earlier and beef arrivals up 63.2% on year. (Reporting by Muyu Xu in Beijing and Twinnie Siu in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)</p>
