      <h3>Bitcoin settles above $7,500</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD avoid a reversal of its progress from earlier this week, which saw the pair suddenly surge from $6,500 to $7,600. </p>
      <p>Since the bullish shift on Nov. 25, Bitcoin has broadly held onto its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-retains-75k-after-bullish-breakout-upends-bear-market">higher levels</a>, with only a brief dip below $7,400 challenging a steady grind higher.</p>
      <p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at just above $7,550, near its weekly high of $7,640. </p>

      <p>Markets broadly shook off recent negative sentiment over a Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and an assumed insider hack at <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-crypto-exchange-upbit-confirms-theft-of-342-000-ether-50m">South Korean exchange Upbit</a> this week. </p>
      <p>For regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a>, the door was now open for further gains which could take BTC/USD over the $8,000 threshold. </p>
      <p>“8-8,2k looks possible if there is a breakout. A fail to break 7600 could mean looking at the range below,” he told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel in a fresh update on Thursday. </p>
      <p>Longer-term, Bitcoin was still down 16% compared to the same time last month, while weekly, the largest cryptocurrency managed 7% gains. </p>
      <p>Analysts had previously anticipated such volatile performance to endure over the coming months — before next May’s block reward halving, the sentiment would remain mixed, statistician Willy Woo <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/willy-woo-8k-bearish-bitcoin-price-in-unique-setup-before-halving">said</a> last week. </p>
      <h3>Altcoins stabilize after a volatile week</h3>
      <p>Altcoins meanwhile settled in line with the relatively stable Bitcoin price on Friday. Among the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap, most saw flatter performance than on previous days.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin, was up 1.8% at $154, preserving fresh support at $150 and could be headed for a run to $170, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/black-friday-rally-to-170-for-ether-heres-what-must-happen">according</a> to fresh analysis. </p>

      <p>Others showed similar behavior, with the notable exception of several <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">Chinese</a> coins including Tron (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tron">TRX</a>) and VeChain (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/vechain">VET</a>), which all flashed negative in light of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-drops-below-73k-as-china-vows-to-dispose-of-exchanges">pressure</a> from local authorities. </p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $206.2 billion at press time, with Bitcoin’s share at 66.4% of the total.</p>
