          <b>Irish Rail services between Sandymount and Lansdowne in Dublin were suspended earlier this morning after a truck crashed into the barriers.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident occurred at the barriers at Serpentine Avenue in Dublin 4, leaving commuters without the busy service for a lengthy period of time.</p>
      <p>Irish Rail released a statement on their Twitter account this morning regarding the incident along with footage of the crash.</p>
      <p>The video shows a white truck stop at the level crossing before driven through, causing significant damage to the barrier.</p>

      <p>Irish Rail have since posted an updating saying services are back operating from Sandymount but with delays due to signalling issues.</p>
