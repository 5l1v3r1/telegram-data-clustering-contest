      <p>When most of us want to lose weight, we stick to our leafy greens, but can grease and salt give you the same effects you’re looking for in a salad?</p>
      <p>One Taiwanese girl challenged all odds and lost 15 kgs after only eating fast food items for all 3 meals a day.</p>
      <p>The girl took to the Chinese platform, <a href="https://www.dcard.tw/f/weight_loss/p/232574851-%E6%B8%9B%E8%82%A5-%E4%B8%80%E7%94%9F%E4%B8%AD%E6%9C%80%E5%80%BC%E5%BE%97%E9%A9%95%E5%82%B2%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B%EF%BC%83%E5%9C%96?utm_source=dcard_fb&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=201911271600_weight_loss_232574851&amp;fbclid=IwAR1vRbC4nJ8MEF8gdVlIPUFfYgr8mqdVt6RzBmV-L4x-Bi4Mt3FPliWIXm4">DCard</a> to share her story of how she decided to lose weight after she had overheard a colleague speak about how big her legs were in a skirt. What’s shocking is that she had managed to lose the weight after eating specific items at McDonald’s everyday.</p>

      <p>She wrote, “I personally heard a colleague say that my legs were too thick, and yet I dared to wear a skirt. But because of you, I am the person I am now. Without you, I may still be 70 kgs.”</p>
      <p>She credits her weight loss to eating very specific items at McDonald’s, where she works.</p>

      <p>“I work at McDonald’s and eat it 3 times a day. I don’t touch french fries, fried chicken skin, apple pies, burger buns and sugary drinks. I only eat the burger meat, lettuce, eggs, crispy chicken wings, non-sugary drinks and peeled fried chicken,” she said. “I really wanted to eat french fries at first. It’s a pity to not eat french fries at McDonald’s.”</p>
      <p>She also avoided having supper and boba milk tea, only indulging in sugarless green tea, sugarless black tea and Coke Zero when she’s craving sweet treats. Loads of water also contributed to her weight loss, even though she very much dislikes H20.</p>

      <p>Exercise also came into play considering she was originally a size XXL, but after months of dedication and effort, she saw herself go from an M to an S within a month.</p>
      <p>“I’d run 10 laps at least 3 to 4 times a week. I’d also go to the gym sometimes,” she added. “When I saw my efforts were not wasted, I really wanted to cry. My hard work was well worth it.”</p>

      <p>The girl specified that no diet pills were used during her weight loss efforts but encouraged those who want to lose weight to not be stingy when it comes to food.</p>
      <p>“Please don’t go on a diet. If you choose not to eat and lose weight, you may never eat again. There are so many delicious things in the world, if you don’t eat it, it would be such a waste.”</p>
      <p>Hence, exercise, pick and choose your meals, but live life to the fullest.</p>
      <p>It’s truly inspiring to see how she turned her life around instead of wallowing in her suffering, and yet still has such a bright attitude towards life.</p>
