      <p>CHICAGO — A woman who witnessed the fatal 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police officer has settled her lawsuit against the city.</p>
      <p>Alma Benitez alleges in the federal lawsuit filed in 2016 that investigators tried to pressure her into changing her account of the shooting. Benitez was in a fast-food drive thru when she claims she saw police surround an African-American man on foot. She claimed the man, later identified as McDonald, was shot a short time later.</p>
      <p>Attorney Amanda Yarusso on Friday said Benitez was happy to “have this chapter reach a resolution.” Yarusso refused to give details of the settlement and officials in Chicago’s laws department refused to comment.</p>
      <p>A jury found former officer Jason Van Dyke guilty in October 2018 of second-degree murder and aggravated battery. He was sentenced to six years in prison.</p>
