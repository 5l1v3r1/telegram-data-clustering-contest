      <p>Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, an ardent conservative who worked to forge a stronger military alliance with the United States, died on Friday at the age of 101, an official at his son’s office said.</p>
      <p>In-office for five years from November 1982 to November 1987, Nakasone was known for trying to transform the nation defeated in World War II into a full-fledged member of the West during the Cold War era.</p>
      <p>His efforts to strengthen security ties with Washington came at a time of intensifying trade friction with the United States, the world’s biggest economy.</p>
      <p>Describing Washington as “the most important partner for Japan”, he built a friendship with then President Ronald Reagan.</p>
      <p>Officials at the office of his son Hirofumi Nakasone, who is a member of the Japanese parliament’s upper house, confirmed the ex-premier’s death to AFP, with one of them saying he died Friday, without offering further details.</p>
      <p>He broke post-World War II taboos in Japan by deciding to provide military technology to the US and scrapping the cap on the nation’s annual defence budget.</p>
      <p>Seen as a security hawk and a nationalist, Nakasone’s positions on defence angered left-wingers in Japan, at a time when anti-war sentiments were even stronger than today after the defeat in World War II.</p>
      <p>Echoing the “Reaganomics” policies of the American president, Nakasone privatised national enterprises such as railway and telephone operators, leaning in favour of the free market and a small state.</p>
      <p>He also left his mark on Japan’s relations with neighbours China and South Korea, which have been haunted by wartime history.</p>
      <p>He was the first Japanese prime minister to visit South Korea, which had been under Tokyo’s colonial rule from 1910 to the end of World War II in 1945.</p>
      <p>In 1985, he visited a controversial war shrine but did not go the next year after China strongly criticised the move as an attempt to whitewash history.</p>
      <p>He stepped down as prime minister in 1987 as support for his government plummeted after he tried to introduce a large-scale indirect tax system.</p>
