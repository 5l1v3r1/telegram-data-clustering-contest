        <b>Glasgow-based fast fashion chain Quiz will update on current trading ahead of the key festive period when it reports interim figures next week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In October the group <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/retail/glasgow-s-quiz-cautions-over-weaker-earnings-1-4810669">warned that trading conditions on the UK high street had remained “very challenging”</a>.</p>
      <p>A double-digit sales slump at its UK stores in the six months to 30 September saw overall revenue fall by 5 per cent to £63.3 million.</p>
      <p>However, online sales grew by 7 per cent to £20m and the group said it had continued to see “solid growth” through its own websites on the back of significant investment.</p>
      <p>International sales increased by 3 per cent to £12m, reflecting growth in revenue from franchise operations and its Spanish stores.</p>
      <p>At the time of October’s update chief executive Tarak Ramzan said the group was focused on improving the performance of its physical stores.</p>
      <p>Quiz’s share price is now around a tenth of what it was when it floated in July 2017.</p>
