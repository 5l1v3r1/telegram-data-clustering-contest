      <p>What happened on Elias Lindholm's overtime goal for Calgary that beat the Sabres, 3-2, on Wednesday night at KeyBank Center?</p>
      <p>Rasmus Ristolainen was caught on the ice for the entire 77 seconds of overtime and pondered a change one time but couldn't leave. He then made a futile chase for the puck behind the net but Lindholm got in front and curled it past Linus Ullmark for the game-winner.</p>
      <p>"I wanted off the ice but didn't think I was close to getting off," Ristolainen said Thursday. "If I change, they might have a 2-on-1 there. I don't want to put my teammates in a bad situation, have a bad change. I tried to battle through it and maybe get a whistle and it didn't work out.</p>
      <p>"When you're tired, you make stupid plays. I guess if I was a split-second earlier, I would have caught the pass behind the net. If I was a split-second later I would have stayed in front of the net. Everything went wrong there. I thought we earned a win but it's not always going your way."</p>
