      <p>The Reserve Bank of India has filed a bankruptcy petition against troubled mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), the regulator said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>This is the first instance of an insolvency proceeding against a company in the financial sector.</p>
      <p>DHFL was facing a liquidity crisis for more than an year after banks choked lending which resulted in defaults. Banks have an exposure of â‚¹40,000 crore to DHFL.</p>
      <p>As per rules, an interim moratorium will now commence from the date of filing of the application till its admission or rejection.</p>
      <p>Last week, the RBI formed a three-member advisory committee to assist the administrator of troubled mortgage lender DHFL.</p>
      <p>Rajiv Lall, Non-Executive Chairman, IDFC First Bank Ltd; N.S. Kannan, Managing Director and CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd; and N.S. Venkatesh, Chief Executive, Association of Mutual Funds in India, were part of the advisory committee</p>
      <p>Earlier the RBI had superceded the Board of the home financier and appointed former MD&amp;CEO of Indian Overseas Bank, R Subramaniakumar, as the Administrator.</p>
