      <p>Unai Emery’s tenure at Arsenal has come to an end after just 18 months.</p>
      <p>The former Valencia, Sevilla and Paris St Germain coach took over from Arsene Wenger in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Emery, though, could not take the Emirates Stadium club back into the Champions League after finishing fifth last season and then losing the Europa League final against Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks at the targets Emery failed to achieve, which cost him his job following a run of seven games without a win.</p>
      <h3>Get back into the Champions League</h3>

      <h3>Improve record against ‘top-six’ opposition</h3>
      <blockquote><b>Arsenal's recent away record against 'big six'<br/></b>   •  Played: 24<br/>   •  Won: 0<br/>   •  Drawn: 9<br/>   •  Lost: 15<br/>   •  Goals for: 26<br/>   •  Goals against: 54<br/>   •  Points: 9 (from a possible 72)</blockquote>
      <p>That porous rearguard has meant addressing a miserable head-to-head record against Arsenal’s main Premier League rivals. While the odd good result against such foes at the Emirates Stadium have been notable highs – including wins over Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United in Emery’s maiden season – the away record is an aberration. Since a 2-0 victory at Manchester City in January 2015, Arsenal’s record in Premier League away games against City, Spurs, United, Chelsea and Liverpool is appalling – they have won none of the last 24 games, losing 15 and drawing nine. That record spans the last years of Wenger’s tenure as well as Emery’s first season and the start of the current campaign and highlights just how deep-rooted the issue is.</p>
      <h3>Address away form in general</h3>
