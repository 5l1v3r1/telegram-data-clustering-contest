        <b>Discussions are underway to expand Liverpool’s Anfield Road Stand with the club also teasing the possibility of hosting a GAA match at the iconic stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/features/emackenna/mackenna-on-monday-liverpool/">The Premier League leaders</a> plan to add around 7,000 seats to the stand bringing the total capacity of the stadium to over 61,000.</p>
      <p>No date is set as of yet as it is still at a draft stage and the club will hold various public consultations before deciding which course of action to take.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/375238-liverpool-fc-launches-public-consultation-anfield-road-expansion">club’s official website</a>, if plans go ahead it could pave the way for Gaelic games to be played at the home of the European Champions.</p>

      <p>“The plans for the proposed Anfield Road Stand expansion include exploring the opportunity for permanent permission to hold concerts and other major events at Anfield, including other sporting events such as Gaelic games and American football outside of the matchday calendar.”</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>A statement from Liverpool’s chief operating officer Andy Hughes can be read in full below:</p>
      <p>“For any expansion to the Anfield Road Stand to go ahead we need certainty on three key areas.</p>
      <p>“Firstly, that we are able to reach agreement with local residents, businesses and community groups that they will allow the expansion plan to take place, which will mean closing a short section of Anfield Road between 96 Avenue and Skerries Road.</p>

      <p>“Secondly, that we have the right sustainable financial and economic model in place to deliver a long-term sustainable Anfield. And lastly, that we are able to successfully navigate the complex planning landscape. We need to be satisfied on all three points for work to proceed.</p>
      <p>“We are working towards creating an expanded Anfield Road Stand which will see around 7,000 additional seats. The majority of these seats will be for general admission use and we expect some seats will be allocated for a sports bar/lounge-type hospitality in order to ensure the economic viability of the expansion.</p>
      <p>“Further profiling is needed and we expect to provide more detail at the second-stage consultation early next year. These first-stage consultation sessions we are holding are crucial as they will be used to inform the design proposals we are developing, which in turn will help us to make a decision on whether to proceed with the expansion as a whole.”</p>
