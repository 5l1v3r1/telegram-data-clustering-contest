      <p><b>European Space Agency</b> (<b>ESA</b>) members agreed Thursday a record 14.4 billion euros <b>budget</b>, promising to maintain Europe's place at the top table as the United States and China press ahead and industry disruptors such as Elon Musk's Space X present new challenges, AFP reported.</p>
      <p>The <b>budget</b> is split, with a total of EUR 12.5 billion over three years and a total of EUR 14.4 billion over five, an increase of around four billion compared to the previous budget.</p>
      <p>"Its a surprise, even more than I proposed... this is good," <b>ESA</b> head Jan Woerner told a press conference after ministers from 22 Member States met in Seville for two days.</p>
      <p>Woerner said the funding pledges mean that <b>ESA</b> can implement a full series of programs plus additional scientific work, pointing out steps to increase ground monitoring as part of efforts to monitor climate change, among other things.</p>
      <p>"It is a giant step forward for Europe," said Jean-Yves Le Gall, head of the French space agency.</p>
      <p>"We broke all records in terms of financial contributions," Le Gall added.</p>
      <p>Germany made the largest contribution to the <b>budget</b> - around € 3.3 billion, followed by France - € 2.7 billion, Italy - € 2.3 billion and the United Kingdom with € 1.7 billion.</p>
      <p><b>ESA</b> is not a body of the European Union and therefore the UK's position as a member remains unchanged despite Brexit.</p>
      <p>Among the projects highlighted by <b>ESA</b> were the first Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, LISA and the Athena Mission, designed to "make fundamental progress in our understanding of the basic physics of the universe."</p>
      <p><b>ESA</b> has confirmed its commitment to the International Space Station by 2030 and its participation in the Gateway project, the first space station scheduled to orbit the moon.</p>
