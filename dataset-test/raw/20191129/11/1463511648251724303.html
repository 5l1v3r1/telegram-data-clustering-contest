      <p>Arsenal have confirmed a temporary successor to Unai Emery for Sunday’s Premier League clash at Norwich City.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have pulled the trigger on Emery amid their worst run of results since 1992.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s Europa League defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt was the final nail in Emery’s coffin.</p>
      <p>Arsenal legend Freddie Ljungberg will take the reins for the time being.</p>
      <p>He was Emery’s assistant first-team coach before the axing.</p>
      <p>A statement from Arsenal read: “The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.</p>
      <p>“We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach. We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward.</p>
      <p>“The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete.”</p>
