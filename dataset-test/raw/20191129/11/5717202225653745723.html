      <h1>Emi Martinez blames Arsenal players in heartfelt Instagram post to Unai Emery</h1>

      <p>Emi Martinez has blamed Arsenal’s players for underperforming during Unai Emery’s reign in a heartfelt Instagram post, following the Spaniard’s sacking on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Emery was relieved of his duties after going seven league and cup matches without a win. Arsenal surrendered a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday night, as Daichi Kamada scored a stunning second-half brace.</p>
      <p>The former Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla manager last earned three points in the Premier League back on October 6, and the Gunners board have now felt it is time to get rid of Emery – a long time after Arsenal fans wanted him to leave.</p>
      <p>Back-up goalkeeper Martinez, 27, posted on Instagram after hearing of the news that Emery had been sacked – and the goalkeeper surprisingly took aim at his teammates as well as stating he is looking forward to meeting Emery in the future.</p>

      <p>The Telegraph have since claimed following Emery’s sacking that Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti is being considered, with the former Chelsea boss hardly enjoying his time at the moment with the Serie A side.</p>
      <p>Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo and Manchester City assistant Mikel Arteta are also viewed as potential replacements for Emery. Freddie Ljungberg will take temporary charge this weekend as the Gunners take on Norwich City.</p>
