      <h1>Mo Farah back on track for 10,000m target at Tokyo Olympics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:11:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Olympic champion Mo Farah has announced his return to the track ahead of next year's Tokyo Games, where he will chase more gold in the 10,000 metres.</p>
      <p>The Brit made the <a href="https://twitter.com/Mo_Farah/status/1200350624497504259">announcement</a> on his YouTube channel on Friday.</p>
      <p>Farah, 36, a four-time Olympic champion and six-time world champion over 5,000m and 10,000m, retired from track athletics in 2017 to focus on road marathons, going on to break the British record and win the 2018 Chicago race.</p>

      <p>"Next year I've decided for Tokyo 2020 I'm going to be back on the track," Farah said.</p>
      <p>"I'm really excited to compete and give it a go in the 10,000m ... Hopefully I haven't lost my speed, but I will train hard for it and see what I can do."</p>
      <p>Farah's former coach Alberto Salazar was <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/olympics/trackandfield/story/_/id/27739659/track-coach-alberto-salazar-gets-4-year-ban-us-anti-doping-agency">banned for four years by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency</a> (USADA) in September due to doping violations, and shortly thereafter the Brit -- who has not been accused of any wrongdoing -- <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/olympics/story/_/id/27827069/mo-farah-bemoans-agenda-alberto-salzaar-ban">responded angrily to questions about his former mentor</a>, with whom he achieved some of his best performances.</p>
      <p>"It's very disappointing to see you guys going at it again and again, and headlines, 'Farah, Farah, Farah'," he told a news conference.</p>
      <p>"There is a clear agenda to this. I know where you are going with it. I have seen it with Raheem Sterling and Lewis Hamilton."</p>
