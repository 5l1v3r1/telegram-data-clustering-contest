      <p>Cape Town - Gospel star Solly Moholo stunned passengers – who were left stranded after the taxi they were in broke down – when he stopped and performed for them recently.</p>
      <p>The video which has gone viral on Twitter, shows Solly in front of his car, facing the stranded passengers and singing and dancing for them.</p>
      <p>According to the tweet, their taxi got a tire puncture which left everyone waiting by the roadside for it to be fixed.</p>
      <p>Although Solly wasn’t in his signature ZCC Khaki outfit, he still performed as if he were on an actual stage for his audience.</p>
      <p>The performance reportedly happened on Theo Martin's Poort (R80) between Pretoria and Soshanguve.</p>
      <p>"Guys the taxi got a puncture and Ntate Solly Moholo got off to perform for us. Southy is lit lit," the tweet read.</p>
