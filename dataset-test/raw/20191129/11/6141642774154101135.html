      <p>A leading cleric in Iraq has warned of civil war after a deadly day of violence in which security forces shot dead 40 people in the capital and the southern provinces.</p>
      <p>The country’s top Shiite cleric called on politicians to “reconsider” their support for the current government.</p>
      <p>Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said the parliament that voted for the government of Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi is “invited to reconsider its choices in that regard”, in his weekly Friday sermon delivered in the holy city of Najaf.</p>
