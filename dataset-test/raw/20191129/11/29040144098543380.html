      <p>Of the deals above, the P30 Pro in particular is a tempting proposition. Huawei's flagship is among our favorite phones of 2019, and £46 per month is only a hair over EE's SIM-only prices. If you want a P30 or P30 Pro without the carrier deal, Huawei self has some <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-p30-pro-ps429-might-be-best-uk-deal-black-friday">excellent offers</a> on its own Amazon storefront.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, iPhone fans can get similar savings on devices across Apple's lineup, including the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinmid%3D5571%26awinaffid%3D228921%26clickref%3DUUacUdUnU83084YYw%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fshop.ee.co.uk%252F%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fshop.ee.co.uk%252Fbasket%252FCONSUMER_PAYM_VD_HANDSET_4G%252Fiphone-xs-64gb-gold%252Fessential-plan-100gb-64&amp;token=wniGVpAL">iPhone XS 64GB with 100GB of data</a> for £64pm and £30 upfront.</p>
      <p>As usual with EE, the carrier offers a variety of optional benefits for contract customers, so it's worth shopping around on the EE Black Friday portal.</p>
