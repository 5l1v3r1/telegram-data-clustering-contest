      <p>DETECTIVES IN THE North are treating as murder the death of 11-month-old Hunter McGleenon.</p>
      <p>The boy died overnight on Monday in Keady, Co Armagh.</p>
      <p>Following the results of a post-mortem which was completed yesterday, the PSNI confirmed this morning the case was being treated as murder.</p>
      <p>Detective chief inspector Eamonn Corrigan, who’s leading the investigation, said: “My thoughts remain with Hunter’s family and loved ones who are coming to terms with their devastating loss.</p>
      <blockquote>This is something no parent should ever have to experience. His family should be looking forward to Hunter’s second Christmas.</blockquote>
      <p>Corrigan said that a 31-year-old man has been arrested and remains in custody at this time.</p>
      <p>Police were given an extra 36 hours to question him following his arrest, and this expires at midnight tonight.</p>

      <p>“As part of my investigation, I am interested in the movements of a White BMW 5 Series, registration 11D14035, around the Keady area during the early hours of Tuesday 26 November,” Corrigan said, adding an appeal for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
