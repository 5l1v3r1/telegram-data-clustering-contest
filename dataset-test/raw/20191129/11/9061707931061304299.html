      <h1>Virgin Media accused of signing up pensioner for TV contract without permission</h1>

      <p>A Burton pensioner has blasted Virgin Media after claiming they signed him up for TV and phone services without his permission.</p>
      <p>David Cooper, 68, was at home in Wood Street, Burton when Virgin Media were installing cables nearby.</p>
      <p>Mr Cooper got talking to a salesman who was discussing the company's current deals.</p>
      <p>He said: "Virgin Media were putting new cables in last week and I had a salesman knocking on the door.</p>
      <p>"He said they were installing cables and asked if I wanted to use them instead of my current (phone and TV) provider.</p>
      <p>"I apologised and explained that I already have existing contracts for my phone and television.</p>
      <p>"He asked when they would run out and I told him April.</p>
      <p>"He gave me a card and said he would be in touch in April to see what he could do for me.</p>

      <p>"I thought that is fair enough. I gave him my name and he knew my address because he was at my door.</p>
      <p>"I thought that was the end of it."</p>
      <p>Later in the week, Mr Cooper was shocked to receive a letter from Virgin Media telling him they had set a date to install his new TV and phone lines.</p>
      <p>He said: "I couldn’t believe it. The letter had an account number they had set up for me without my say-so and an installation date set conveniently for April.</p>
      <p>"I have heard of a hard sell, but that takes the biscuit.</p>
      <p>"I thought I was just being cooperative and polite. Some people might shut the door in salesman's face, but I was trying to be <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/residents-ask-santas-too-scared-3589126">pleasant and honest</a> about the fact I am already in a contract. I heard him out."</p>
      <p>After the Burton Mail contacted Virgin Media for a response, the salesman returned to Mr Cooper's house and apologised for what he described as a "miscommunication."</p>
      <p>Mr Cooper said: "The same salesman came to apologise and said 'I am sorry if you misunderstood, but I was just trying to save you money'.</p>
      <p>"I said 'I want it cancelling because I never agreed to anything'.</p>
      <p>"What annoyed me most was that he set this account up off his own bat.</p>
      <p>"It is the cheek of it. I know I am a pensioner, but I do actually go and shop around and it's my decision who I use.</p>
      <p>"Luckily I wasn't stupid enough to give them my bank details, but what would have happened if I didn't call and complain about the letter?</p>
      <p>"Would they have just turned up in April?</p>
      <p>"This has caused a lot of hassle and I don’t want it to happen to anyone else."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Virgin Media, said: "Due to some miscommunication between a member of our sales team and Mr Cooper, Virgin Media can confirm that his account has been cancelled.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for any confusion and inconvenience caused."</p>
