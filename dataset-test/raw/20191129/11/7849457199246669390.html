      <p>Revenue Deputy Commissioner for Operations Arnel Guballa ordered the shutdown of the retail outlets based on the recommendation of Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR) Revenue Regional Director Douglas Rufino.</p>
      <p>Shuttered were ABS Enterprises owned by Ajet Singh and RGH Motors and Auto Supply operated by Hercules Galap.</p>
      <p>Surveillance operation conducted by CAR taxmen showed the two stores reportedly under-declared sales by more than 30 percent in 2019 compared to the previous year.</p>
      <p>Under Section 115 of the Tax Code, a business is liable to be closed if it under-declared it sales by 30 percent or more.</p>
      <p>Guballa said the businesses will not be allowed to reopen until the deficiency tax assessments are settled.</p>
