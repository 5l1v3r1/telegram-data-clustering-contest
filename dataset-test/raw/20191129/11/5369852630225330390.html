      <p>NEW ZEALAND’S CANTERBURY Crusaders announced today that the team will retain its name but change its logo after a review sparked by the deadly mosque shootings in its home city of Christchurch in March.</p>
      <p>Critics said the name and branding referencing medieval wars between Christians and Muslims were inappropriate after the attacks, in which 51 Muslims died in attacks allegedly carried out by a self-declared white supremacist.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the killings, the Super Rugby giants stopped parading chain-mailed knights on horseback as pre-match entertainment at home games, and indicated the team logo of a sword-wielding crusader would be phased out.</p>
      <p>But there was resistance among fans to changing the name of arguably the world’s most successful club rugby side, with a record tally of 10 Super Rugby titles, three of them won in the past three years.</p>
      <p>The club said the review released today concluded that the name would stay, but that it would adopt the meaning of crusading for good, rather than the war-like meaning of the term.</p>
      <p><a href="https://crusaders.co.nz/mapangomawhero"><b>The new logo</b></a> is a Maori tohu, or symbol, resembling a stylised letter ‘C’ in the club colours of red and black.</p>

      <p>“Ultimately, it was decided that no name better represented the club’s commitment to living its values — crusading for social improvement and inclusiveness, and crusading with heart for our community and for each other — than Crusaders,” chief executive Colin Mansbridge said.</p>
      <p>The club will begin using the new logo immediately but it will not make an on-field debut until 2021, with next year’s kits simply carrying the Crusaders’ name.</p>
      <p>Similar debates have raged in the United States over the names of sports teams with Native American associations, such as the Washington Redskins, Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians.</p>
      <p>In 1997, the Washington Bullets basketball team became the Washington Wizards because then owner Abe Pollin did not want the side to have a name linked to violence.</p>
