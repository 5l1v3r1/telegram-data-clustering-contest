      <h1>Tottenham have been ‘seduced’ by performances of young attacking midfielder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:33:21+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/naveen-ullal/" target="_blank">Naveen Ullal</a></address>
      <p>Saint-Étienne have in recent years seen several of their youngsters climbing through the ranks of their youth system into their first team and their performances have caught attention from other clubs.</p>
      <p>William Saliba is one among them and Arsenal have agreed a deal for his transfer in the last window and then loaned the defender back to the French club.</p>
      <p>Mathys Saban performances for U19 side have reportedly seen him being courted by Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://www.footmercato.net/flash-mercato/info-fm-asse-leipzig-a-un-oeil-sur-mathys-saban_268568">Foot Mercato</a>, RB Leipzig, who have already taken French talents in the past, and the north London club are ‘seduced’ by the 17-year-old’s profile.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga side and Spurs are following the young attacking midfielder who has six goals in 12 appearances for Saint-Étienne U19s.</p>
      <p>It’s to be noted the French website provides no additional information, and don’t claim to know whether Leipzig or Tottenham are leading the race for Saban.</p>
      <p>Leipzig’s interest in Saban was first reported by Foot Mercato’s German counterpart <a href="http://www.fussballtransfers.com/ft-kurve/leipzig-nimmt-frankreich-talent-ins-visier_111552">Fussball Transfers</a>, but in their report there was no mention of the Premier League side.</p>
