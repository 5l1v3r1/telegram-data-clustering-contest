      <p>Early use of breast milk may help prevent heart disease in prematurely born babies, scientists have found.</p>
      <p>The researchers from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) noted that one of the long-term health complications that young adults born prematurely may have is unique heart characteristics.</p>
      <p>These can include smaller heart chambers, relatively higher blood pressure, and a disproportionate increase in muscle mass in the heart, the researchers said.</p>
      <p>One study cited in the review, published in the journal <i>Pediatric Research</i>, looked at 30 preterm-born adults, who were assigned to receive exclusive human milk during their hospital stay at birth.</p>
      <p>The study also included 16 preterm-born adults assigned to receive an exclusive formula-based diet. Both the groups then underwent detailed cardiovascular assessment between 23 and 28 years of age, including an MRI scan of their hearts.</p>
      <p>The hearts of those born prematurely had smaller chambers than the hearts in people who were not born early, the researchers said.</p>
      <p>However, the study showed that the smaller heart chambers were less profound for the exclusively human milk-fed group, compared to those who were fed only formula milk.</p>
      <p>This suggests a potentially protective effect of human milk for heart structure, the researchers said.</p>
      <p>They then identified possible reasons for why breast milk results in a lower risk of heart disease.</p>
      <p>Breast milk could help prevent heart disease by better-regulating hormones and growth factors, strengthening the infant’s immune system, reducing inflammation, and by possibly improving the metabolism of the child.</p>
      <p>Identifying the key components within breast milk that result in improved heart health could pave the way for a more targeted approach to long-term cardiovascular wellbeing for those born prematurely, according to the researchers.</p>
      <p>“It is becoming increasingly clear that premature birth results in long-term adverse cardiovascular effects with important clinical consequences. There is a distinct lack of preventative and therapeutic interventions available to alleviate those effects,” said Professor Afif El-Khuffash, from RCSI.</p>
      <p>“The current evidence comes from observational studies and highlights the strong link between early breast milk administrations and improvement in long-term heart health, but it lacks concrete mechanistic explanations,” EL-Khuffash said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The researchers said more studies on the composition of breast milk could make clear exactly what causes these health benefits, which may lead to better treatment options</p>
