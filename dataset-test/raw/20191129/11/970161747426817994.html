      <p>A <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> woman says she was told to ‘go home’ and gets ‘physically assaulted in broad daylight’ after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>’s comments comparing the burka to ‘letterboxes’.</p>
      <p>Her comments came during last night’s BBC Question Time, and were directed at journalist and author Lionel Shriver, who was on the panel.</p>
      <p>During the discussions, Ms Shriver says the prime minister’s comments, in which he used a Telegraph column to describe Muslim women who wear the burka to ‘letterboxes and bank robbers’, were taken out of context.</p>
      <p>As she attempted to defend Mr Johnson’s statement, a Muslim woman in the audience is asked how she feels.</p>
      <p>She responds: ‘When I walk down the street, I get told, after that, to go back to my own country.</p>
      <p>‘I am from here’.</p>
      <p>She then goes on to ask Ms Shriver to ‘take responsibility’.</p>

      <p>Ms Shriver says that Mr Johnson’s column was arguing about the right of Muslim women to wear what they want, to which the Muslim woman responds, ‘that also includes the niqab’.</p>
      <p>She adds: ‘There are consequences to what you say, because of that I get abuse on the streets, I’m talking on behalf of many Muslims.</p>
      <p>‘I get physically assaulted just walking to the gym in broad daylight’.</p>
