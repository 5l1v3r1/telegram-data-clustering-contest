      <p>An article published Wednesday by Chinese researchers in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1766-2">the journal Nature</a> confirmed the discovery of LB-1, a black hole about 15,000 light years away with a mass 70 times greater than that of our sun, or more than three times as massive as researchers previously thought possible.</p>
      <p>“Black holes of such mass should not even exist in our galaxy, according to most of the current models of stellar evolution,” Liu Jifeng, who led the team, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1766-2">said in the article</a>, adding, “Now theorists will have to take up the challenge of explaining its formation.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/28/asia/china-black-hole-discovery-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html">According to CNN</a>, LB-1 is not the biggest black hole ever discovered, but it could potentially be the largest of its kind.</p>
