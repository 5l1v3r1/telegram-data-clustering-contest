      <p>It was curtains for <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/kidambi-srikanth">Kidambi Srikanth</a> as he lost his men’s singles quarterfinals contest but <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/sourabh-verma">Sourabh Verma</a> and <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/rituparna-das">Rituparna Das</a> kept Indian challenge alive by progressing to the last-four in the ongoing <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/syed-modi-international-badminton-championships-2019">Syed Modi International Badminton Championships 2019</a> in Lucknow on Friday.</p>
      <p>The third-seed Srikanth has been struggling for form this year since his runners-up finish at the India Open earlier this year. He went down fighting against world No. 1 Son Wan Ho 18-21, 19-21, his seventh defeat to the Korean in 11 meetings.</p>
      <p>But Sourabh won his men’s singles quarter-final match, beating Thailand’s Kunlavut Vitidsarn 21-19, 21-16, who is a three-time world junior champion and the reigning Asian junior champion.</p>
      <p>Sourabh will next face Korean Heo Kwang Hee in the semi-finals on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In the women’s singles, Rituparna and compatriot Shruti Mundana put up a thrilling show, a contest that went down the wire. Rituparna lost a closely contested opening game 24-26 before finding momentum to draw level in the second game with a 21-10 scoreline in her favour. The decider was also a close affair and Rituparna prevailed, pocketing the game 21-19.</p>
      <p>Rituparna, winner of the 2016 and 2018 Polish International, will now square off against Thailand’s Phittayaporn Chaiwan for a plane in the final.</p>
      <p>It was a disappointing day for Indian shuttlers in women’s doubles though. Kuhoo Garg and Anoushka Parikh lost 15-21, 9-21 to Hong Kong duo of NG Wing Yung and Yeung Nga Ting.</p>
      <p>The young doubles pair of Simran Singhi and Ritika Thaker were outclassed by Linda Efler and Isabel Herttrich of Germany. They bowed out losing 7-21, 16-21 in another quarterfinal match.</p>
