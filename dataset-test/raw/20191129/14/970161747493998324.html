      <p>The Apprentice candidate Ryan-Mark Parsons has been rushed to hospital after dropping a £1,000 jar of caviar on his foot, which is the most extravagant accident we’ve come across in, well, ever.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was fired by Lord Alan Sugar earlier this month and in another blow he’s down grand’s worth of fish eggs – and gained a battered toe.</p>
      <p>‘Ryan-Mark was rushed to hospital yesterday after dropping a jar of caviar on his foot,’ a friend close to the reality star spilled.</p>
      <p>‘It was only a little jar but it was made of thick glass and fell from a real height. He literally couldn’t walk and blood was everywhere.’</p>

      <p>They added to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/apprentices-ryan-mark-rushed-hospital-20988395">Mirror Online</a>: ‘Ryan-Mark was devastated, not because he thought he had broken his foot, but because it was a kilo of Royal Oscietra Caviar, which costs over £1,000 a jar.’</p>
      <p>‘Thankfully I’ve not broken my foot, but I did have to have an operation resulting in two parts of my toenail being removed,’ Ryan-Mark explained.</p>

      <p>Ryan-Mark’s misfortune comes after he was embroiled in a vicious spat with Marianne Rawlins this week as she revealed to Metro.co.uk her rival <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/27/the-apprentices-marianne-rawlins-claims-ryan-mark-parsons-insulted-client-branding-them-common-in-unaired-scenes-in-double-firing-11224064/">called a client ‘common’ in unaired scenes.</a></p>
      <p>He swiftly fired back and told us <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/apprentice-candidate-ryan-mark-blows-nasty-marianne-rawlins-making-false-claims-11232344/">the accusations were simply not true.</a></p>
      <p>‘It’s so untrue and a very vindictive comment,’ he raged. ‘She is trying to justify why she said there was a disconnect between me and the client the next day.</p>
      <p>‘She is a very nasty individual. We were at an awards ceremony on Tuesday and she completely ignored me.</p>
      <p>‘Making false claims about this so-called explosive argument is very predictable of her character.’</p>
