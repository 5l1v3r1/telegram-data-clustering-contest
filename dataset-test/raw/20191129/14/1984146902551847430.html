      <p>Police seized drugs, weapons and a million illegal cigarettes after searching a horse box as part of dawn raids this week.</p>
      <p>Officers executed a warrant at a home in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/winlaton">Winlaton</a> in Gateshead on Wednesday morning as it was believed there could be stolen goods there.</p>
      <p>A stash of cannabis was found as well as hundreds of thousands of cigarettes inside a large horse wagon.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of cigarettes were also seized from farmland linked to the home on Holinhill Lane.</p>

      <p>Police have revealed that a total of a million suspected illegal cigarettes were taken off the streets.</p>
      <p>Officers also seized an air rifle during the search along with a number of suspected stolen power tools.</p>
      <p>A 61-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen property and a 62-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing cannabis. They have both since been released under investigation.</p>
      <p>The investigation has since been passed to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) who will carry out an investigation into the illegal sale of cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Detective chief inspector Steve Byrne, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police’s</a> CID, said officers would continue to do all they can to disrupt organised criminality.</p>
      <p>He said: “This operation was the result of weeks of preparation and we are pleased to have taken these suspected illegal items off our streets.</p>

      <p>“Often we see organised crime groups involved in this type of activity with the intention of making money so they can continue to fund their illicit activities.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to pursuing criminals and protecting our communities as part of Operation Sentinel, which is our collaborative approach to tackling serious and organised crime.</p>
      <p>“That work will continue but we need the help of the public to disrupt organise crime and prevent the sale of illegal drugs and goods.</p>
      <p>“If you see any suspicious activity in your neighbourhood then pick up the phone and call us. We can work with partners to make our streets a safer place to live.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about illegal activity in their neighbourhood can call police on 101, report online at the Northumbria Police website or call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
