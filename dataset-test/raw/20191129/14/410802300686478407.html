      <p>Nissan has indicated that its body-on frame challenger to the Toyota Fortuner, Ford Everst, Isuzu MU-X and Mitsubishi Pajero Sport, the Terra, could very well come to South Africa once local production of the Navara kicks-off next year.</p>
      <p>This, according to Nissan South Africa Media Relations Manager Veralda Schmidt, who, despite not mentioning the Terra by name outright, confirmed to <i>The Citizen</i> on the side-lines of the unveiling of the <a href="https://citizen.co.za/motoring/motoring-news-motoring/2211799/datsun-go-cvt-and-revised-renault-kwid-join-a-segment-war/">Datsun Go CVT</a> last week that prospects are favourable for a Navara-based SUV to become available in the coming years.</p>
      <p>At present, the Terra, which debuted last year, is only offered in select Asian markets using the same 2.3-litre twin-turbodiesel engine as the Navara in Thailand, the previous generation D40 Navara’s 2.5-litre YD25DDTI oil-burner in the Philippines and a 2.5-litre petrol motor in China.</p>

      <p>Schmidt however stated that initial focus will be placed on Navara production at its Rosslyn Plant outside Pretoria, following Nissan’s announcement in April that it will invest R3-billion into the facility for manufacturing of the next generation pick-up.</p>
      <p>“You will see many activities at our plant over the next 18 to 21 months. Once we have established [Navara production], the chances are very good that there might be a Navara-based SUV available to our market, however, we first have to finish our plant and get our Navaras built before building other products,” Schmidt said.</p>
      <p>In a departure from the current Navara, Schmidt are confirmed that the next generation will continue to be offered in double cab bodystyle, but also a single cab for the first time after the discontinuing of the King Cab option when the D40 ended production five years ago.</p>

      <p>At the same event, Nissan South Africa Marketing Director Kabelo Rabotho also confirmed that the automaker has no plans afoot to bring the <a href="https://citizen.co.za/motoring/motoring-news-motoring/2185770/nissan-gives-titan-a-new-suite-and-more-fire-power/">Titan</a> to market in spite of <a href="https://citizen.co.za/motoring/motoring-news-motoring/2203428/nissan-titan-another-step-closer-to-rhd-reality/">Australia’s on-going push for it to be made in right-hand-drive</a>.</p>
      <p>“The decision to bring any vehicle is always based on economics. If the economics are right then the decision will be made, but at present, there is no indication [of the Titan] coming to South Africa,” Rabotho said.</p>
