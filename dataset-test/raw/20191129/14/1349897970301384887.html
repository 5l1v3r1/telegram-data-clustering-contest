      <ul>
        <li>The group have posted on social media with regards to the Clasico at Camp Nou</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tsunami Democràtic have released another statement calling for protests on Dec. 18, the day of the Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid at Camp Nou. </p>
      <p>The Clasico has already been rearranged once. It was postponed on Oct. 26 because La Liga and the RFEF deemed that it could not go ahead due to the protests around the decision to jail Catalan civic leaders and politicians. </p>
      <p>This time, Tsunami Democràtic asked for the collaboration of both clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid, to display a banner with the words 'Sit and Talk.' They have now called for protests having not received a response. </p>
      <p>In the statement, the group say: "Tsunami Democràtic is aware of the importance of the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid for fans of the sport. But this is an exceptional political situation.</p>
      <p>"Everyone must understand that all parties need to sit down and talk about freedom, fundamental rights and the right to self-determination in Catalonia.</p>
      <p>"We call for a day of mobilisation on Dec. 18 and call on all citizens to reserve that date and come to Barcelona."  </p>
