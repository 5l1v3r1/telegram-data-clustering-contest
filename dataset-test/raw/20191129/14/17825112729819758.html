      <p>Bern - A Swiss aristocrat who killed his friend with a candlestick is to be freed from jail – because he thought his victim was a green alien.</p>
      <p>British graduate Alex Morgan, 23, was on an Alpine skiing holiday when he was brutally attacked by drug-addled millionaire art-dealer’s son Bennet von Vertes.</p>
      <p>Vertes was so high on cocaine and ketamine at his parents’ chalet that he says he mistook his friend for an extra-terrestrial.</p>
      <p>The playboy, 34, was initially jailed for 12 years for the crime – but three judges have now downgraded his manslaughter conviction on appeal to the lesser charge of "negligent killing".</p>
