      <p>Terrell Owens certainly knows how to hold on to a grudge.</p>
      <p>The hall of fame wide receiver was going back and forth with Twitter users during the Cowboys-Bills game, when he replied to ESPN’s Josina Anderson about head coach Jason Garrett, TE Jason Witten, and retired QB Tony Romo colluding to get him cut from the team.</p>
      <blockquote>“So what!! They(Garrett,Romo,Witten) colluded &amp; got me cut while on my summer break enjoying myself down in sunny Miami getting ready 4 the next season. Talk about #NoChill! My summer is/was just like a holiday just like Thanksgiving.”</blockquote>

      <p>Owens is referring to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3953647">March of 2009</a> when the Dallas Cowboys released him after paying him a $12 million signing bonus just the year before, which was included as part of a new four-year, $34 million deal.</p>
      <p>Jerry Jones was said to have been “following the advice of many, many people” in jettisoning Owens.</p>
      <p>Owens had documented issues with quarterback Tony Romo and tight end Jason Witten, and often criticized offensive coordinator Jason Garrett’s play calling and his offensive schemes to the point that sources have said Garrett did not believe he and Owens could coexist.</p>
