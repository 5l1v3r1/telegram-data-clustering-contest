        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): India and Pakistan have been engaged in a serious border escalation since a cross border aerial strike by the Indian Air Force in February. The two arch-rivals have deployed their troops and military equipment at forward bases to retaliate in case of a misadventure by either side.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Indian Army has decided to deploy around 200 armoured fighting vehicles equipped with locally developed anti-tank guided missiles in the country’s Punjab and Rajasthan regions. These are set to boost the army’s capabilities, as it can operate in terrain interspersed with rivers and canals.</p>
      <blockquote>“Armoured vehicles will be deployed in plain region bordering Pakistan", an official on Friday confirmed. The 8x8 wheeled armoured vehicles will have a minimum cruising range of 500 km on road and 250 km in a region with rivers or canals.</blockquote>
      <p>For the vehicle's protection, two long-range anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launchers will be available.</p>
      <p>The Indian Army also asked manufacturers to provide a man-portable ground anti-tank guided missile launcher in addition to the vehicle-mounted ATGM. 30mm cannon with 7.62mm coaxial machine gun will also be available for the crew.</p>
      <p>The vehicle is also capable of detecting all types of chemical, biological, and nuclear contamination.</p>
      <p>The development comes against the backdrop of an escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan after the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911251077398722-indian-air-force-seeks-more-assets-to-deter-misadventures-from-adversaries/">Pulwama terrorist attack</a> in Kashmir in which over 40 Indian security personnel were killed by a purportedly Pakistan-based terrorist organisation called Jaish-e-Mohammed.</p>
      <p>The escalations reached a near war-like situation after a cross border aerial strike by the Indian Air Force in the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911211077367594-pakistan-bashes-indias-plan-to-open-siachen-worlds-highest-battlefield-for-tourism/">Balakot area inside Pakistan</a> in February this year.</p>
      <p>For the past four months, a huge deployment of forces took place in the western sector after Pakistan threatened India with massive retaliation in the wake Jammu and Kashmir's special status being revoked by New Delhi.</p>
