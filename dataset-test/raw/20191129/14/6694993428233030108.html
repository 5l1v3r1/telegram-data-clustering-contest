      <h1>Met Office issue cold weather alert warning for this weekend as temperatures plunge</h1>
      <h2>The Met Office say there's an 80 per cent chance of cold weather affecting much of England until Monday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:37:06+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:37</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Carter, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/helen-bennicke/</a></address>
      <p>The Met Office has issued a cold weather alert warning with an 80 per cent risk of "severe cold weather" over the weekend across England.</p>
      <p>The low temperatures could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.</p>
      <p>The very cold overnight temperatures and widespread frosts are likely across the North of England and Midlands throughout Friday and until Monday morning.</p>
      <p>"Daytime temperatures are also remaining in the low single figures of Celsius, especially across rural parts," it said.</p>
      <p>"Mostly places [will be] dry, although a few very isolated wintry showers are possible across North Eastern coasts," warned the Met Office alert.</p>
      <p>People are urged to maintain regular contact with vulnerable neighbours and ensure they have access to warm food and drinks.</p>

      <p>The public should "avoid exposing yourself to cold or icy outdoor conditions if you are at risk of cold-related illness or falls".</p>
      <p>"Overnight mist and freezing fog patches are possible across Central England, leading to a cold day on Saturday. Across the far South and South West, temperatures could recover a little on Saturday, with a small chance of rain."</p>
      <p>In Manchester, the Met Office predicts temperatures will not rise above 5 degrees Celsius, with lows of -2C coming on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>It will stay cold and dry for most of Sunday into Monday.</p>

      <p>Separately, a yellow Met Office weather warning is in place as temperatures plunge, with fog likely to lead to some travel disruption on Friday night and into Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The warning is in place from 1am on Saturday until 11am.</p>
      <p>The change in temperature is as result of Arctic winds blowing southwards causing temperatures to tumble.</p>
      <p>It covers a swathe of England, across Yorkshire, south to Birmingham and East Anglia and the home counties North of London.</p>
      <p>After heavy rain in October and earlier this month, there are still seven Environment Agency flood warnings in place where flooding is expected and immediate action is required.</p>
      <p>Flooding badly affected parts of Derbyshire and South Yorkshire during the heavy rain and 'danger to life' warnings were issued at the time along the banks of the River Don.</p>
