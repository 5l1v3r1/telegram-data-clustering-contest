      <p>Consumer confidence has continued to rise, as house price growth continues and wages increase.</p>
      <p>The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer confidence index rose 3 points in November to 121, above its historical average.</p>
      <p>More households reported feeling positive about the future of the local economy, saying now was a good time to buy a big-ticket item.</p>
      <p>However, they were feeling worse about their own current financial situation, likely because of their debt levels.</p>
      <p>"Things are pretty good for New Zealand households right now," ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said.</p>
      <p>"They have a lot of debt, certainly ... but jobs are pretty easy to find, there has been some decent wage growth, and the housing market is lifting.</p>
      <p>"[It's] not the slam dunk for consumer confidence that it used to be, but [it's] still important."</p>
      <p>The confidence lift adds to a four-point rise in October, and followed a 16 point spike in this month's business confidence survey, which is at its best level in a year.</p>
      <p>Zollner said the latest readings on confidence pointed to a more rosy economic outlook, in line with the Reserve Bank's growth expectations, fuelled by low interest rates.</p>
      <p>"These results will give them [the RBNZ] comfort that they are right."</p>
