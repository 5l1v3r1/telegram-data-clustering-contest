      <p>Mexico City â€“ A world-renowned rock climber, US national Brad Gobright, fell to his death while climbing a sheer rock face in northern Mexico, authorities said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Gobright, 31, and fellow American Aidan Jacobson, 26, were climbing a route known as the Shining Path in the northern state of Nuevo Leon on Wednesday when they fell, the state's emergency response agency said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said the men had finished climbing the 900-metre summit and were rappelling back down when the accident occurred.</p>
      <p>Jacobson landed on a rock outcrop, but Gobright bounced off and fell another 300 metres to his death, they said.</p>
      <p>"Jacobson suffered lesions on his right ankle and various parts of his body. He was treated at our base," the statement said.</p>
      <p>Gobright "lost his life after falling around 300 metres".</p>
      <p>The late rock climber was known for his gravity-defying solo ascents with no ropes.</p>
      <p>Star of the Academy Award-winning documentary <i>Free Solo</i>, Alex Honnold, paid tribute to Gobright on social media.</p>
