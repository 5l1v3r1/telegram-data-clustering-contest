        <b>In the previous week, the reserves had increased by USD 441 million to reach USD 448.249 billion</b>
      </p>
      <p>Foreign exchange reserves continued the upward move, gaining by a modest USD 347 million to touch a new high of USD 448.6 billion in the week to November 22, according to the weekly data released by the Reserve Bank on Friday.</p>
      <p>In the previous week, the reserves had increased by USD 441 million to reach USD 448.249 billion.</p>
      <p>The gain in reserves was mainly on account of an increase in foreign currency assets, a major component of the overall reserves, which rose by USD 254 million to USD 416.725 billion in the reporting week, the data showed.</p>
      <p>Expressed in dollar terms, the foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation or depreciation of non-US units like the euro, pound and the yen held in forex reserves.</p>
      <p>During the reporting week, gold reserves increased marginally by USD 87 million to USD 26.796 billion.</p>
      <p>The special drawing rights with the International Monetary Fund were up by USD 5 million to USD 1.44 billion during the week.</p>
      <p>The country's reserve position with the Fund also increased by a modest USD 2 million to USD 3.635 billion, the data showed.</p>
