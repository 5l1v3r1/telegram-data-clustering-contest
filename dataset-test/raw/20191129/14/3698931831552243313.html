      <p>In a blink of an eye, the year is almost over—and the holiday season is fast approaching. With the festivities and gifts to be exchanged, it can be difficult to pick out suitable presents for your loved ones. But the continued development of technology has led to an increasingly wide range of gadgets that almost everyone can enjoy.</p>
      <p>So if you’re in a position where you simply can’t decide on gifts for your loved ones this holiday season, here’s a list of Huawei’s Smart Life Products that cover everything from technology, fashion, and a combination of the two.</p>
      <h3>Huawei Mate 30 Pro</h3>

      <p>The Mate 30 Pro is one of the leading flagships of 2019—and for good reason. Powered by the Huawei’s latest Kirin 990, along with a versatile camera setup comprising a 40MP Cine Camera, an 8MP Telephoto Camera, and a 3D Depth Sensing Camera, the powerhouse device can be a great companion for a variety of situations. And the headline feature of this camera setup is the ability to shoot ultra-slow motion videos in 7680 fps.</p>
      <p>The phone also comes with a new Air Gesture system, where you can continue to control your phone without actually touching the display. Using pre-set gestures, you can even scroll through pages, even if your hands are otherwise preoccupied with food, etc.</p>

      <p>And if you’re looking for a gaming device, the “Horizon” display of the Mate 30 Pro isn’t just for aesthetic purposes. You can opt to have left and right triggers on the device, which can be customised for a more complete gaming experience. Meanwhile, the display also means that there aren’t physical volume buttons on the device anymore. Instead, you’ll simply need to double tap the side of the screen to bring up a virtual volume slider on the edge.</p>
      <h3>Huawei Gentle Monster Eyewear</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the recipient of your gift is someone who places an emphasis on fashion. The Huawei x Gentle Monster Smart Eyewear series is a hybrid of traditional sun shades and a modern device with smart features. You can pick up calls, listen to music, and of course, keep your eyes shielded from the glare of the sun.</p>

      <p>The shades feature built-in dual speakers, and Huawei says that artificial intelligence helps towards noise reduction during calls—this uses dual microphones that sit on your temples. And they last a decent amount of time on a single charge—2.5 hours—and Huawei promises up to 8 hours of playtime in total, including the leather wireless charging case’s battery.</p>
      <h3>Huawei FreeBuds 3</h3>
      <p>And with the season for Christmas tunes coming, what better way to listen to them than with a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds? Huawei’s FreeBuds 3 are true wireless earbuds that allow users to hear audio clearly—without people on the outside noticing. The idea is that the FreeBuds 3 are subtle and sit in your ears, and they utilise dual-channel synchronous transmission technology to provide real-time balanced audio.</p>

      <p>The FreeBuds 3 also provide better quality of calls, according to Huawei. Active cancellation of noise and echoes allow for crisp calls, even when in noisy environments. Powered by the Kirin A1 chipset, the FreeBuds 3 feature an aerodynamic mic duct design, and studio quality sound.</p>
