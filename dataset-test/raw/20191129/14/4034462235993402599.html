      <h1>Mansory Takes Surprising Approach With Lamborghini Urus</h1>
      <h2>The modern Rambo Lambo doesn't want for much, after all.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:45:32+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Joseph</a></address>
      <p>Some things, they say, are better left unsaid. And some cars, by the same token, are better left understated. Those made by Lamborghini and by Mansory, for better or worse, don't typically rank among them. But this one does.</p>
      <p>Typically known for its outlandish conversions, Mansory has taken a surprisingly subtle approach with its latest modifications for the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/urus">Lamborghini Urus</a> – a vehicle which, like its stablemates, doesn't need much in the way of embellishment. With so many components making up the body kit, it's not so much that Mansory has left well enough alone as much as the restraint it's exercised in upgrading it.</p>

      <p>Mansory's Competition Bodykit for the Urus includes ten sets of components to accent everything from the front lip to the rear diffuser – all crafted from carbon fiber. And as far as a Mansory-tuned Lambo goes, it's all rather subtle, relatively speaking.</p>
      <p>Far more subtle, at any rate, than the widebody version (pictured at bottom) that <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bugatti-chiron-one-of-ten-exotics-mansory-ruined-for-geneva">Mansory revealed at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show</a> earlier this year. But for those who find this "soft" kit too understated, it still offers a range of more overt enhancements, from a choice of rear wings and a completely new (and heavily vented) hood.</p>

      <p>There's a choice of wheels and a range of interior upgrades on offer as well, along with a custom engine cover and sports exhaust. And we're sure that none of it comes cheap, but then neither does the exotic crossover underneath it all.</p>
      <p>As it is, Lamborghini charges a solid $200k for the Urus, making it more expensive than the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/maserati/levante-trofeo">Maserati Levante Trofeo</a>, all but the top versions of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bentley/bentayga">Bentley Bentayga</a>, or most Mercedes sport-utes (save maybe for the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/maybach-gls">Maybach GLS</a>) – and most anything, for that matter, this side of the $325k <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/rolls-royce/cullinan">Rolls-Royce Cullinan</a>. So an extra four or even five figures for some visual upgrades, understated or otherwise, wouldn't likely deter the "average" Urus owner.</p>
