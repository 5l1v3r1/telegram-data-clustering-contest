      <p>Former West Ham midfielder and now Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has defended Manuel Pellegrini as the under pressure Hammers boss takes his strugglers to Stamford Bridge on Saturday.</p>
      <p>West Ham have been on a dire run since September 22 when they last won a game, losing five and drawing two of their previous seven Premier League games to slump from fifth in the table to 17th.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini signed Lampard as a player at Manchester City on a short-term deal prior to joining one of City's sister clubs, New York City FC, ahead of their upcoming MLS season.</p>
      <p>The Blues manager is still making his way in the early stages of his managerial career while his Chilean counterpart in the opposite dugout this weekend has more than 30 years of experience behind him.</p>
      <p>And Lampard has praised Pellegrini, who needs results against Chelsea and Wolves next week to avoid being axed from his job less than 18 months after arriving at the club.</p>
      <p>Lampard said at his pre-match press conference: "He is a good man and manager, he will be working hard to turn them around. We all know the ruthless nature of the game. Every team, every owner, everyone wants to push.</p>

      <p>"I will just do my job. We know how passionate fans are, it will be on both sides.</p>
      <p>"I think with the Premier League it is hard to make judgements at the start of the season. It is a tough league, I have good players. We have West Ham and have good individuals, good team and manager and we have to be ready for them.</p>
      <p>"It's a London derby, we have to be ready."</p>
