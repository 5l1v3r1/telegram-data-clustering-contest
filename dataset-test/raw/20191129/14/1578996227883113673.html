      <h1>The Weeknd's 'Blinding Lights' Lyrics Seem to Address His Feelings for Bella Hadid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:10:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>The Weeknd gave everyone an extra helping of his new music era last night, with the Thanksgiving day release of his second single, "Blinding Lights." While <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29122950/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-relationship-timeline/">"Heartless"</a> lyrically explored how The Weeknd went back to his old playboy ways following his split from Selena Gomez, "Blinding Lights" seems to address how fast he got over playing the field because of the reemergence of his <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29122950/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-relationship-timeline/">on-off girlfriend</a> Bella Hadid.</p>
      <p>The Weeknd hinted at <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29122950/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-relationship-timeline/">the end of "Heartless"</a> that Hadid had just come back: "I lost my heart and my mind / I try to always do right / I thought I lost you this time / You just came back in my life / You never gave up on me (Why don't you?) / I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?) / I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah) / You hear it clear in my tone."</p>
      <p>"Blinding Lights" builds on that and his feelings for the woman who's consistently been there for him.</p>

      <p>The Weeknd and Hadid, in real life, have been in an on-off relationship since April 2015. The two broke up in November 2016; <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a12115489/selena-gomez-and-the-weeknd-relationship-timeline/">The Weeknd dated Gomez</a> from January 2017 to October 2017; then The Weeknd and Hadid started hanging out again in November 2017. They were back to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a22572005/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-dating-exclusively-report/">full-fledge couple status</a> in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>In August 2019, they were reported to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28625896/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-breakup-2019-reason/">break up again but remain friendl</a>y. Sources hinted there's a possibility they could get back together.</p>
      <p>Here, the lyrics to "Blinding Lights," via <a href="https://genius.com/18546920">Genius</a>, with possible references to Hadid explained. Listen to the song below too.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Intro</b><br/>Yeah<b><br/><br/>Verse 1</b><br/>I've been tryna call<br/>I've been on my own for long enough<br/><br/><i>While The Weeknd was first seen hanging out with Hadid in November 2017 after his Gomez split, the two would not be seen spending time together again until Coachella in April 2018. There, they</i><i> were <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19838632/bella-hadid-response-the-weeknd-coachella-kissing-reports/">reported to be "kissing all night"</a> at a music festival party, which Hadid denied. <br/><br/>At the time, a source told <i>E! that</i> "Bella never really lost feeling for Abel [Tesfaye, The Weeknd's real name] and had hope they would eventually get back together. [They’re] secretly seeing each other recently [but] are not official." The Weeknd is "playing the field" and "openly dating" other women while Hadid "wants to be exclusive."<br/><br/>In May 2018, they were seen again at a Cannes Film Festival party. They were photographed <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a20659727/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-cannes-party-kiss/">making </a><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a20659727/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-cannes-party-kiss/">out</a> at that party.</i><i> By July 2018, they were <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a22572005/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-dating-exclusively-report/">officially back together and exclusive</a>.</i><i><br/></i><br/>Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br/>I'm going through withdrawals<br/>You don't even have to do too much<br/>You can turn me on with just a touch, baby<b><br/><br/>Pre-Chorus</b><br/>I look around and<br/>Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)<br/>No one's around to judge me (Oh)<br/>I can't see clearly when you're gone<br/><i><br/>Hadid and The Weeknd have been in <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29122950/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-relationship-timeline/">an on-off relationship</a> for the last four and a half years, a time period where both Hadid’s and The Weeknd's fame exploded as a top model and musician, respectively. The Weeknd singing "I can't see clearly when you're gone" seems to signify how important Hadid's consistency and reliability has been to him in his life.</i><b><br/><br/>Chorus</b><br/>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br/>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br/>I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br/>Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br/>Hey, hey, hey<b><br/><br/>Verse 2</b><br/>I'm running out of time<br/>'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br/>So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh<br/><b><br/>Pre-Chorus</b><br/>The city's cold and empty (Oh)<br/>No one's around to judge me (Oh)<br/>I can't see clearly when you're gone<b><br/><br/>Chorus</b><br/>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br/>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br/>I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br/>Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<b><br/><br/>Bridge</b><br/>I'm just walking by to let you know (By to let you know)<br/>I can never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)<br/>Will never let you go this time (Ooh)<br/><i><br/>Hadid lives in New York City and as a model, travels a lot for work, meaning some of their relationship (and communication during their off-periods) was long-distance. The last time the two dated, things got more serious though: She and The Weeknd ultimately <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a24266417/bella-hadid-moving-in-the-weeknd-nyc-condo/">moved in</a> together in October 2018 before they split this summer. Distance was said to be a big contributor to their latest split. In August, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28625896/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-breakup-2019-reason/">a source told E!</a>, "They are in different places right now, physically and mentally. Bella is prepping for her fashion week commitments and Abel is working on his music and his upcoming acting debut [in the Safdie Brothers' film, Uncut Gems.]" <br/><br/>During Hadid's birthday in October 2019, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29437542/bella-hadid-crop-top-gigi-23rd-birthday-party-photos/">E! reported The Weeknd called her</a> to wish her a happy birthday and then ultimately met up with her in New York City. A source told the outlet then that “The Weeknd did reach out to Bella during the day to wish her a ‘Happy Birthday’ and they have been in touch. There is no bad blood between the two and they are on good terms right now. There isn’t any chance of them getting back together right now, but Bella never wants to have any anger or resentment towards anyone.” When reports emerged shortly after of the two <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29442318/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-dating-again-birthday-party/">getting back together</a>, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29451291/the-weeknds-bella-hadid-not-dating/">The Weeknd's rep shut them down</a>. The Weeknd and Hadid "attended [her birthday party] as friends," the rep said. They haven't been photographed hanging out together since then.</i><b><br/><br/>Chorus</b><br/>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br/>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br/>Hey, hey, hey<br/>Hey, hey, hey<b><br/><br/>Outro</b><br/>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br/>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</blockquote>
