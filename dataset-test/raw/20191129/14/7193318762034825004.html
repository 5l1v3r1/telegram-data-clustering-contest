        <b>Downtown in December makes the holiday season merry and bright</b>
      </p>
      <p>From the inaugural Sugar Plum Promenade and the first March of the Trees to the return of an icy favorite and a Native American rendition of Christmas carols, the holidays will be especially merry and bright in Downtown Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>In its 18th year, Downtown in December includes more than 30 holiday events and attractions, coordinated and produced in part by the Downtown Oklahoma City Partnership, in collaboration with other organizations.</p>
      <p>Some of this weekend's kickoff activities, including the OKC Tree Lighting Festival, the season's first snow tubing sessions and the first Free Holiday Water Taxi Rides, have been shifted to Saturday due to Friday's rainy weather forecast.</p>
      <p>"There's literally something for everyone, whether it's running a 5K, taking your dog to the dog park to get pictures with Santa or going on a bar crawl through Automobile Alley," Downtown Oklahoma City Partnership Communications Manager Danielle Dodson said, with the latter referring to the sixth OKC Crawl planned from 6 to 11 p.m. Dec. 13 in Automobile Alley to benefit the Junior League of Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>"I think that it will only continue to grow, because when you have this momentum ... it's just so much easier to add more to that and get people on board and have an even bigger reason to come downtown."</p>
      <p>In honor of a certain iconic Christmas carol, here are 12 top events planned for Downtown in December. For even more, go to <a href="https://downtownindecember.com/">downtownindecember.com</a>.</p>

      <p><b>1. LifeShare WinterFest and Snow Tubing, </b>Saturday through Jan. 4, Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark: A longtime yuletide favorite, the snow tubing was benched last year as the ballpark was undergoing renovations. The attraction again will offer two towering slopes for thrill seekers.</p>
      <p>All public snow tubing sessions slated for Friday have been canceled due to the inclement weather forecast. Tickets purchased for Friday's snow tubing sessions can be exchanged at the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark Ticket Office for any other session based on availability. The special $10 unlimited riding offer will be available in conjunction with the OKC Tree Lighting festival from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. this Saturday only. Information: <a href="https://www.milb.com/oklahoma-city">OKCDodgers.com</a>.</p>
      <p>"There were over 20,000 people who attended in 2017, so we anticipate it being a really big season again this year. That's one of our premier events," Dodson said.</p>
      <p><b>2. Sugar Plum Promenade, </b>5 to 9 p.m. Dec. 13 and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Dec. 14, Scissortail Park.

Information: <a href="https://scissortailpark.org/">scissortailpark.org</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's nice that it's another free public space where people can just gather in the holiday season and enjoy the holiday festivities and spirit without paying to go to a specific event. So, we're super excited to have this other urban space available for the community," said Holly Hoyler, Downtown OKC Partnership's events and special projects coordinator. "I'm sure it will grow from here."</p>

      <p>"They're packing all that magic into one weekend at the Myriad Gardens ... and it's going to be able to be bigger and better than it's ever been because they're taking over the whole Myriad Gardens," Dodson said.</p>
      <p><b>5. Free Oklahoma City Streetcar rides,</b> weekends through Jan. 5, throughout downtown. Along with offering complementary rides Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, Embark is celebrating the Oklahoma City Streetcar’s first year of service with an all-day birthday party Dec. 14.

      <p>"This is has been a longstanding tradition in the community. I think it first started in 2002 as like the Mayor's Tree Lighting, and it's really just evolved since then," Hoyler said. "When Mayor Holt became involved last year, it really got a new life to it with his 1OKC motto and really bringing in new cultural acts and groups. This year we're really excited to have some diverse groups as well."</p>
      <p><b>7. Devon Ice Rink,</b> through Feb. 2, Myriad Gardens. The ice rink remains one of downtown OKC's most popular seasonal attractions. Information: <a href="https://downtownindecember.com/">DowntowninDecember.com</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's a big diverse group that attends ... and there's so much happening at the Myriad Gardens that it's easy to pair that with something that's free or affordable because they have lots of programming throughout the gardens throughout the whole season," Hoyler said.</p>

"It's open to any abilities. You don't have to be training all year to do this. You can do the one-mile if you'd like to just work off some Thanksgiving food and all the holiday treats you've been having."</p>
