        <b>Arsenal were reportedly interested in Jose Mourinho, but he has no regrets about joining Tottenham instead.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho felt there was “no point” considering a missed opportunity to become Arsenal head coach as he is “so happy” at rivals Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Manchester United manager Mourinho was named Spurs boss last week after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery was also dismissed at Arsenal on Friday, having been under pressure for a number of weeks, enduring a seven-match winless run in all competitions.</p>
      <p>It was reported following his exit the Arsenal board had been interested in Mourinho prior to his appointment at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>However, the Portuguese was not interested in entertaining the idea at a news conference before Saturday’s home match against Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>“There is no point to talk about it,” Mourinho said. “It didn’t happen [when I was out of work], it happened now.</p>

      <p>“And I am so happy here that I couldn’t even think about the possibility of going to another place. You could put now in front of me any club in the world and I would not move.”</p>
      <p>Reflecting on Emery’s sacking, Mourinho added: “It’s always sad news. I felt it as a kid when my dad was sacked as a manager. I felt it when I was sacked previously.</p>
      <p>“There is not one single manager where I am happy when they are sacked. I always feel the deja vu situation. I am sad for it, but that’s life.</p>
      <p>“Unai is a fantastic coach. He was not happy at Arsenal, obviously, but he’s a fantastic coach with a proven record.</p>
      <p>“With a little bit of a rest, another big club will come for him and his career will be back on track. No dramas, mi amigo. Keep going, and you will get another club.”</p>
