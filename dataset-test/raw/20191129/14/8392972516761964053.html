      <p>Filled with water and glitter, the candle has dimensions of 25cm by 9cm and is made of plastic.</p>
      <aside>Really calming and adds the wow factor.</aside>
      <p>It is also battery-powered, meaning it can be displayed on window sills, fireplaces and cupboard to give any room an immediate festive feel.</p>
      <p>Several would-be buyers insisted in the Facebook group they would be snapping one up as soon as they next make a trip to the budget supermarket.</p>

      <p>"Am going to buy some more for table centre pieces and add a bit of holly etc round the bottom. Am so pleased with this purchase."</p>
      <p>A third person summed it up as: "If you like snow globes then you are going to love this, it's mesmerising."</p>
      <p>But another punter advised: "Looks lovely but motor is so loud I couldn’t stand it and had to return it. Such a shame."</p>
