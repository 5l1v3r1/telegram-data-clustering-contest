      <h1>Pep Guardiola reveals what Man City can't afford to do in Premier League title race with Liverpool FC</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City are nine points behind Liverpool in the Premier League table and Pep Guardiola has laid down a challenge to his players.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:20:06+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Tyrone Marshall, http://www.facebook.com/TyMarshallMEN/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has told his <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> players they can't afford to lose any more Premier League games if they are to haul in Liverpool at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>The Blues boss insists he isn't thinking about winning the Premier League title at the moment, but did admit that his side can afford no more major slip-ups if they're to chase down Jurgen Klopp's side, who are currently nine points clear.</p>
      <p>City are now in the heart of their busiest stretch of the season and they face another defining week in the title race, with trips to Newcastle tomorrow, Burnley on Tuesday and then the derby against United at the Etihad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I know we cannot lose games. I’m not thinking about winning the Premier League right now," Guardiola said of his side's position in the table.</p>
      <p>"The target is the next one when you have games every three days."</p>
      <p>The next one is a trip to St James' Park tomorrow, a ground where City turned in their worst performance of last season to lose 2-1, having taken the lead inside the first minute.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Guardiola</a> was disappointed with the performance of his team in that game at the end of January, but City responded to win 14 successive Premier League games and claim the title by a point from Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Ahead of a return to the north east the City boss insists that defeat is now consigned to the past, in part because of the response that followed and a return to the qualities Guardiola had come to expect from his side.</p>
      <p>"It’s forgotten. We played slow, didn’t attack. We forgot to attack," he said.</p>
      <p>"We’ve learned from that and spoke about it. We had a bad afternoon. It wasn’t the way we are. We have to be ourselves. Saying the truth is not to be angry. Newcastle made a good defensive performance, had two shots on target and we didn’t play like we could.</p>
      <p>"We tried to be who we are from the next game. At that moment I didn’t think we’d win the Premier League and 14 games in a row."</p>
