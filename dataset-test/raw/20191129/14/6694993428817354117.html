      <h1>Aldi shopper spots what could be the worst 'Black Friday deal' of all time</h1>
      <h2>'Bargain of the day'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:09:09+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Pugh, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/rachel-pugh/</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday is now in full swing, and shoppers have been inundated with deals on pretty much every single product you can shake a stick at.</p>
      <p>From Apple AirPods, to Now TV sticks and <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/build-a-bear-black-friday-17209671">Build-A-Bear teddies</a> , there really is something to keep everyone happy in the sales.</p>
      <p>But while there are many fabulous deals to be had, one shopper has spotted the best one yet - and it comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/aldi">Aldi</a> .</p>
      <p>Posting a picture of a pile of McVitie's biscuits on Twitter, Spod1000 pointed out the phenomenal offer.</p>
      <p>Under the picture, Spod1000 wrote: "Black Friday is here. Bargain of the day."</p>
      <p>It has to be seen to be believed, but Aldi has slashed an incredible ONE PENCE off the biscuits.</p>
      <p>Calm down, Aldi, don't be spoiling us too much now.</p>
      <p>The <i>Manchester Evening News</i> has contacted Aldi for comment on the bargain find, and we'll update you when we can.</p>
      <p>Yesterday shoppers rushed to Aldi stores and were seen queuing in store car parks - not to get their hands on the £3.99 biscuits, but to try and nab some goodies from the Kevin the Carrot toy range.</p>
      <p>However, scenes of chaos quickly began, as people became disgruntled with the lengthy waiting times.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, one frustrated shopper expressed their anger: "Thought I’d get up early and go out to see if I could get one of those Kevin the carrot toys at Aldi.</p>
      <p>"Got there and the queue was snaking back past the store with people still coming. All that for a toy!"</p>
      <p>"I am in a queue at  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/aldi?src=hash">#aldi</a>  to buy fluffy sprouts..." said somebody else.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Queues are forming over a carrot! A plush carrot at that!  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/kevinthecarrot?src=hash">#kevinthecarrot</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aldi?src=hash">#Aldi</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Worksop?src=hash">#Worksop</a> ."</p>
      <p>"Stalybridge Aldi sold out of Kevin’s in 20 minutes," another said.</p>
