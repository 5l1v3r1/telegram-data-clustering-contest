      <p>Boris Johnson’s father, Stanley, has been criticised for appearing to suggest the British public is illiterate.</p>
      <p>In an appearance on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show, the 79-year-old was told that one viewer had called his son “Pinocchio”. Johnson replied: “Pinocchio? That requires a degree of literacy which I think the Great British public doesn’t necessarily have.”</p>
      <p>The show’s presenter, Joanna Gosling, standing in for Derbyshire, asked what he meant by that, to which Johnson replied that he didn’t want to go into it.</p>
      <p>“That’s quite a pejorative thing to say about the Great British public,” Gosling suggested.</p>
      <p>Johnson said: “They couldn’t spell Pinocchio if they tried, I shouldn’t have thought.” He then challenged Gosling to spell it.</p>
      <p>Johnson said he had been trying to make the point humorously, but he thought it was “utterly absurd and wrong that you can read out on air a tweet coming in from one of your readers which calls the prime minister a liar. I think it is amazing you can do that.”</p>
      <p>On social media, Johnson was accused of outrageous snobbery and arrogance.</p>
      <p>During the campaign, Boris Johnson has been repeatedly criticised over trust and honesty issues. The journalist Peter Oborne was part of a team that <a href="https://boris-johnson-lies.com/">launched a website</a> collating “the lies, falsehoods and misrepresentations of Boris Johnson and his government”, and Labour launched a <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Time-To-Tell-The-Truth-60-Questions.pdf?1">“Time to tell the truth”</a> campaign asking 60 questions it said the prime minister must answer.</p>
      <p>Stanley Johnson does not have a formal role in government or the Conservative party but he has played a part in the election campaign. On Thursday night he went to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/ice-sculpture-to-replace-boris-johnson-in-channel-4-climate-debate">Channel 4 leaders’ debate</a> as part of the Conservatives’ attempt to have Michael Gove appear in place of the prime minister.</p>
      <p>The move was roundly mocked on social media as Johnson was accused of “sending his dad” to the debate rather than taking part himself.</p>
