      <h1>Video: Ole Miss Kicker Has Heartbreaking Reaction To Missed Kick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:36:27+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Thursday night, the Ole Miss Rebels and Mississippi State Bulldogs were battling it out in the Egg Bowl. While the rest of America was busy stuffing out collective faces with Thanksgiving dinner, an SEC rivalry unfolded.</p>
      <p>Both teams entered the game with losing records. However, a bone-headed play resulted in the Bulldogs walking out with a 6-6 record and a bowl berth.</p>
      <p>Trailing 21-14 with just two minutes left in the game, Ole Miss put together a remarkable drive – including converting on a fourth and 24 – to score what looked like would be the game-tying touchdown.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Matt Corral, who replaced starter John Rhys Plumlee, threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Elijah Moore with just four seconds left on the clock.</p>
      <p>Moore received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he acted like a dog peeing on the Mississippi State field.</p>
      <p>Here’s the celebration.</p>

      <p>Officials flagged Moore on the play for unsportsmanlike conduct, which backed kicker Luke Logan back to the 18-yard line.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Logan’s worst nightmares were realized on a national stage as his kick went wide right, resulting in a loss for the Rebels.</p>
      <p>Logan’s reaction to the play is heartbreaking.</p>

      <p>Ole Miss fell to 4-8 on the season with the loss.</p>
