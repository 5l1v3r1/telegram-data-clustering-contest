      <p>London Bridge was the scene of an attack in June 2017 when three militants drove a van into pedestrians and then attacked people in the surrounding area, killing eight people.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Britain lowered its national terrorism threat level to "<b>substantial" </b>from <b>"severe"</b>, its lowest level since 2014.</p>
