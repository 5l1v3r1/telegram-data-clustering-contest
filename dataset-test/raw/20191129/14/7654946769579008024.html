      <p>There didn’t appear to be a whole lot of giving thanks in the Dallas Cowboys’ locker room.</p>
      <p>Instead, the team got a heaping earful from one of its own.</p>
      <p>Following their Thanksgiving loss to the Buffalo Bills — their sixth defeat in nine games — veteran defensive end Michael Bennett was heard screaming at his teammates.</p>
      <p>“The champions are the people that get remembered,” Bennett told <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/cowboys/2019/11/29/a-fiery-michael-bennett-had-this-message-for-his-cowboys-teammates-following-loss-to-the-bills/">the Dallas Morning News</a> of his fiery speech. “They don’t remember who got the biggest contract. A whole bunch of great players got great contracts, but they don’t get remembered as champions. Champions are the ones who get the gold plates and the jackets and they understand what it takes to win. That’s just a certain mindset. That’s just a certain ability to play tough in adverse moments.”</p>
      <p>Bennett, the veteran defender acquired from the Patriots this season, was well-received with his outburst, which according to multiple reports was of the angrier variety.</p>
      <p>“Credit the leaders,” Prescott said. “Credit Michael Bennett, those guys that started that. It was a great conversation, a lot of great words passed. But it’s just all about us executing and just getting the job done. It starts throughout the week with us doing things better.”</p>
      <p>Owner Jerry Jones, who stated he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/28/jerry-jones-response-after-the-latest-cowboys-debacle/">would not be making an in-season coaching change</a> despite Jason Garrett’s red-hot seat, was witness to Bennett’s pleas and seemingly appreciated them.</p>
      <p>“Everybody in there that had anything to say have earned the right to say it,” Jones said. “You didn’t have anybody period that didn’t have the right to express themselves.”</p>
