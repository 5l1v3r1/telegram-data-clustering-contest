      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lori-loughlin">Lori Loughlin</a> and her fashion designer husband, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mossimo-giannulli">Mossimo Giannulli</a>, reportedly were not in a celebratory mood on Wednesday as they marked their wedding anniversary.</p>
      <p>The couple, who are preparing their case in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/college-admissions-scandal">college admissions scandal</a>, marked 22 years of marriage, but a source close to them claims the upcoming trial has sucked up all their focus.</p>

      <p>“Their anniversary is the last thing on their mind, as they’re trying to figure out their legal options and the case against them,” a source <a href="https://people.com/tv/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-low-key-anniversary/">told People magazine</a> prior to the big day. “They’re unified and working together to fight these charges, but they’re not really in a celebration mood, as far as I can tell.”</p>

      <p>“It’s all business all the time with them as they move through this,” the source added. “Anything they do will be low key and just between the two of them.”</p>
      <p>The actress and her husband <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlin-and-husband-plead-not-guilty-to-new-charges-in-college-admissions-scandal">pleaded not guilty</a> to expanded charges in the college admissions scandal after being counted among 11 parents additionally accused of bribery.</p>

      <p>The Justice Department announced in October that the duo, along with nine other parents, were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-new-charges-college-admissions-scandal">indicted on additional federal charges related to bribery</a>. A grand jury in Boston indicted the parents on charges of trying to bribe officials at an organization that receives at least $10,000 in federal funding.</p>
