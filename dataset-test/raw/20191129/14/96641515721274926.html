      <h1>Oculus Go drops to $150 on Amazon in Black Friday sale</h1>
      <h2>It could be your most affordable way into stand-alone VR.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>You're looking at one of the most affordable ways to immerse yourself in stand-alone VR. Amazon is selling the 32GB <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/01/oculus-go-review/">Oculus Go</a> headset for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076CWS8C6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;language=en_US">$150</a>, down from the usual $199, as part of its Black Friday sales. There have been substantial discounts before (the Go dropped to $159 in a flash sale this summer), but this is steeper than usual.</p>
      <p>The Go has its limitations. It can track your head movements, but it doesn't have the body-tracking six degrees of freedom you'll find in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/30/oculus-quest-review-wireless-vr/">Oculus Quest</a> and many PC VR headsets. At this price, however, it's an easy pick for simpler VR games, apps and 360-degree video. For that matter, it's helpful if you just want to catch up on shows without using the TV or disturbing anyone else -- it's effectively a private theater. It's a solid bargain as long as you set your expectations accordingly.</p>
