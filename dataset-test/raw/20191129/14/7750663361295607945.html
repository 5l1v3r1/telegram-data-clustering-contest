      <p>The Gunners <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/sack-race/news/arsenal-sack-manager-unai-emery_381027.html">announced on Friday morning</a> that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> had been sacked as head coach following a seven-game winless run in all competitions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/freddie-ljungberg/"><b>Freddie Ljungberg</b></a> has been placed in temporarily charge of the club and will lead the team into Sunday's Premier League clash with Norwich City at Carrow Road.</p>
      <p>However, according to Italian journalist <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gianluca-di-marzio/"><b>Gianluca Di Marzio</b></a>, Arsenal have made Nuno their number one target to take the job on a full-time basis, with contact already being established between the two parties.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old has been in charge of Wolves since 2017, leading them out of the Championship and into the Premier League, where they have established themselves once again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikel-arteta/"><b>Mikel Arteta</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carlo-ancelotti/"><b>Carlo Ancelotti</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/massimiliano-allegri/"><b>Massimiliano Allegri</b></a> have also all been mentioned as possible candidates for the position.</p>
