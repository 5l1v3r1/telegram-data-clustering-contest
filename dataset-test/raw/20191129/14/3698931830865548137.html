      <h1>iPad and Apple Watch Series 5 LTE are coming soon on Maxis Zerolution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:42:49+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>Apart from <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/18/apple-watch-series-5-lte-malaysia-digi/">Digi</a> and <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/29/apple-watch-series-5-lte-celcom-pre-order/">Celcom</a>, it appears that you can soon get the latest Apple Watch Series 5 with LTE support from Maxis. On top of that, the green telco is also offering iPad with cellular connectivity on instalment as well.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.maxis.com.my/campaigns/apple-watch-ipad/">Maxis</a>, the Apple Watch Series 5 (GPS + Cellular) and iPad (WiFi + Cellular) will be offered with zero upfront payment via its Zerolution program. They didn’t mention which iPad model they are offering but based on their teaser image, it appears that the iPad Pro will be one of the available options.</p>

      <p>With the Apple Watch cellular edition, you can stay connected and receive SMS and voice calls without your iPhone with you. As mentioned previously, the Apple Watch requires Voice over LTE (VoLTE) for voice calls and this could be an indication that Maxis is finally offering HD Voice over 4G. VoLTE is a prerequisite to support the Apple Watch and that’s one of the biggest reasons why Digi was the first telco in Malaysia to offer it.</p>
      <p>For a seamless experience, Maxis is expected to offer a multi-sim one-line feature via eSIM. This will allow you to share one mobile number for both the Apple Watch and for your iPhone.</p>

      <p>From the looks of it, both Apple Watch and iPad Zerolution offers will be available only at selected <a href="https://www.maxis.com.my/centre/store-locator/">Maxis Stores</a> from the 13th December 2019. So far, Maxis has not revealed any contract pricing for both devices. To recap, the Apple Watch Series 5 LTE variant is priced from RM2,199 for the 40mm size and RM2,349 for the larger 44mm size.</p>
