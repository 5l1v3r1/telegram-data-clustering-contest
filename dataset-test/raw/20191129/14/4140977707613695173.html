          <p>Frank Lampard is going to have a special night as he will be going to West Ham as a manager for the first time. The former English footballer has some unpleasant memories with the Hammers and it was a bad breakup between the two parties in 2001.</p>

                      <p>Thus, either of Michy Batshuayi or Oliver Giroud would most probably start against West Ham at the Stamford Bridge. The pair of Willian and Christian Pulisic has been good on the wings so far and will probably start the game.</p>
                      <p>Mason Mount will see less number of minutes in the game, as Mateo Kovacic, Jorginho and N’Golo Kante will be starting in the midfield. Coming to defence, Lampard can make few experiments but a pair of Cesar Azpilicueta and Emerson on flanks with Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori in centre.</p>
