          <p>During a league match of the ongoing season of The Ford Trophy between Wellington and Otago in Lincoln, veteran Otago batsman Neil Broom put on display an incredible scoop shot off Wellington fast bowler Hamish Bennett which went for a four behind the stumps.</p>
          <p>In what was a short delivery from Bennett, Broom made all sorts of adjustment to play the ball from outside the off-stump. The batsman eventually jumped in the air to make contact with the ball as he scooped it over Wellington wicket-keeper Lauchie Johns.</p>

                <p>After Otago captain Jacob Duffy won the toss and chose to bat, his team scored 262/6 on the back of Broom’s ninth List A century. Coming in to bat at No. 3 in the fifth over, Broom ended up scoring 112 (127) with the help of 13 fours. Having scored a half-century in the previous match, the 36-year old batsman banked on his good form today.</p>
                <p>In what ended up as a close encounter, Otago bundled out Wellington for 260 in 49.4 overs to win the match by 2 runs. Wellington all-rounder Malcolm Nofal, who came in to bat at No. 4 in the 14th over, top-scored for his team with 87 (102) with the help of five fours and two sixes.</p>
