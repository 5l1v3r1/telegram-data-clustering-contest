      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/1200449966482841600">police in London</a> on Friday shot dead a man suspected of stabbing several people near London Bridge at 2 pm local time. The suspect had a “hoax explosive device” strapped on his body.</p>
      <p>“As you would expect due to the nature of the incident, we responded as though this was terrorist related,” Assistant Commissioner of Police Neil Basu told reporters. “I am now in a position to confirm that it has been declared a terrorist incident.”</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it an “appalling incident” and thanked the “emergency services and members of the public for their immense bravery” in responding to the attack.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the suspect stabbed several people before being wrestled to the ground and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2019/nov/29/london-bridge-incident-police-city">disarmed by members of the public</a>, according to a Press Association report cited by <i>The Guardian</i>. The newspaper reported that at least five people were injured in the attack. Underground services at the nearest station to London Bridge were halted by authorities.</p>
      <p>In 2017, eight people were killed when three Islamist terrorists drove a van into crowds crossing London Bridge before attacking others with knives on the bridge and in neighbouring pubs and restaurants.</p>
