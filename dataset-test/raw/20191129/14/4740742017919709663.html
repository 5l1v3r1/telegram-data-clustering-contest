      <h1>Bristol photographer says Rachel Riley's Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt is 'morally wrong'</h1>
      <h2>Bristol-based photographer Rob Scott photographed Jeremy Corbyn being arrested in 1984</h2>

      <p>A Bristol-based photographer has said Rachel Riley's T-shirt bearing an altered image of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is "morally wrong".</p>
      <p>The Bristol-based photographer, Rob Scott, photographed Mr Corbyn being arrested at an anti-apartheid demonstration in 1984.</p>
      <p>Ms Riley recently posted a photo of herself to her Twitter account wearing an altered version of the image taken. The message reads, "Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-50559938">Mr Scott told the BBC</a>: "The message has been changed and I'd like an apology".</p>
      <p>Ms Riley has been a vocal critic of antisemitism in the Labour party and has been approached for comment.</p>
      <p>In response, Mr Corbyn has said the party have taken "rapid and effective" action, adding anti-Jewish racism is "vile and wrong".</p>

      <p>Mr Scott is currently working in the Solomon Islands and is not a fan of social media. But when he saw the photo of Rachel Riley's T-shirt he had to respond, saying he never gave permission for the image to be used.</p>
      <p>"Hijacking the message within an image and replacing it with one completely at odds with the original is morally wrong, particularly when racism is concerned," he told the BBC.</p>
      <p>"This image is floating around and I'm making virtually nothing from it when as a photographer I rely on royalty payments to keep going."</p>

      <p>Rachel Riley justified her actions by sending this tweet.</p>
      <p>"I didn't feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight. I don't endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn. Please see my pinned thread if you still don't understand why. #LeadersDebate #LabourAntisemitism."</p>
      <p>The photo of Mr Corbyn resurfaced during the 2015 leadership bid for the Labour Party and has remained online ever since.</p>
