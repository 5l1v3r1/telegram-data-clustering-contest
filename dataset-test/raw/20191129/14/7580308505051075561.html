      <p>Arsenal Football Club interim coach Freddie Ljungberg on Friday promised to give everything to put smiles on faces of the fans after a disappointing start to the season.</p>
      <p>“However long I oversee Arsenal for I will give everything I have to put smiles on faces again,” Ljungberg said in a tweet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://guardian.ng/sport/arsenal-appoints-ljungberg-as-interim-manager/">Ljungberg was appointed Arsenal interim manager</a> after the sack of coach Unai Emery on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal board said they are confident of Ljungberg’s abilities for the games he will be managing the team.</p>
      <p>“We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward,” Josh Kroenke said on behalf of the Arsenal board.</p>
      <p>Arsenal said their <a href="https://guardian.ng/sport/arsenal-sack-unai-emery/">decision to sack Emery was due to poor team performance</a> and unfavourable results in recent weeks. The club, however, thanked Emery for his efforts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://guardian.ng/sport/emery-reaches-breaking-point-as-arsenal-crash-in-europa-league/">Arsenal’s last 2-1 loss in the Europa League against Eintracht Frankfurt</a> on Thursday night made it seven consecutive matches without a win for the Gunners. This is Arsenal’s worst run since 1992.</p>
      <p>In the Premier League, Arsenal currently sits 8th on the log with four wins, six draws and three losses</p>
      <p>The club said they have started the search for a new head coach and will make an announcement when the process is complete.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg, however, will begin his interim managerial career with the Gunners when they travel to Norwich on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We have a busy few weeks ahead and the team needs your support,” Ljungberg said.</p>
