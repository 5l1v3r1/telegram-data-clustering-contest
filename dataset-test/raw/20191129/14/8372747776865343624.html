      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Southwest Florida is seeing its earliest sunsets of the year this week, as we approach the winter solstice.</p>
      <p>Beginning on Monday, November 25th, the sun has been setting at Sanibel Island at 5:35 p.m. It will continue to set at that time through December 6th, when it begins to slowly happen later each evening.</p>
      <p>However, that doesn't mean our days are getting longer again just yet. Since the sunrise time is moving later at a faster pace in December, the amount of daylight each day will continue to shorten until the winter solstice on December 21st.</p>
      <p>That day, Southwest Florida will only see just under 10 hours and 28 minutes of daylight.</p>
      <p>.</p>
