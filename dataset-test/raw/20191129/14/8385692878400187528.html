      <p>If you're in the market for a new security camera, Black Friday is the perfect way to get one… or a couple of them. Arlo is one of the most popular security camera manufacturers, and it has decided to <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discount</a> several of its products.</p>
      <p>The Arlo Pro, Pro 2, Ultra, and Baby Monitor are all discounted at the moment. All of these discounts are available via Amazon, and they're discounted up to 48-percent.</p>
      <p>Let's start with the Arlo Pro, shall we. As part of this package, you'll get the Arlo home security camera system with siren.</p>
