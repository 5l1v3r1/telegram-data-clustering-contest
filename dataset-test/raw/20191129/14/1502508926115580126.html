      <p>The world's first fully Blockchain-powered smartphone BOB (Blok on Blok) that runs two different operating systems (OS) at the same time seamlessly is now available for purchase for $599 (nearly Rs 43,000).</p>
      <p>The smartphone can be bought in various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin via digital asset wallet app Xwallet. The users of the app will get the device for $539 as pre-order discount from November 30 to December 14, Singapore-based Pundi X Labs which is the maker of the device said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The XWallet mobile app connects regular digital asset wallets with the Pundi X payment ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Built entirely on and for the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/blockchain">Blockchain </a>by Pundi X Labs, a leading developer of blockchain-powered devices, the smartphone has Android 9.0 as base OS, allowing it to function like a regular Android smartphone.</p>
      <p>The second OS called Function X or f(x) OS that runs BOB gives users a new smartphone experience, the company posted on Medium on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Powered by the Function X <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/blockchain">blockchain </a>and ecosystem, any action made within the f(x) OS will be decentralized, it added.</p>
      <p>Texts, calls, Internet browsing and sharing of files will all be transacted on the Blockchain, providing users full control of their data, taking back data privacy with BOB.</p>
      <p>Users will be able to switch seamlessly between the two operating systems in BOB with just a swipe.</p>
      <p>This flexible feature allows users to ease into using a blockchain-powered smartphone at their own pace, as they can simply switch to the Android 9.0 OS if they want to access their regular Android-based apps and services.</p>
      <p>BOB comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon GPU 512 with 64-bit addressing. Its storage is made up of 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, which can be expanded to 512GB.</p>
      <p>Each BOB unit will also have a 4.97-inch AMOLED touch screen. It will have HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixel) with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
      <p>BOB's battery will have a capacity of 3300mAh, and the unit supports wireless charging, said Pundi X Labs.</p>
      <p>BOB comes with a 48MP rear camera with an F/2.0 aperture as well as a 16MP front camera with an F/2.2 aperture.</p>
      <p>BOB will have a fingerprint sensor, a 3.5MM headphone jack, and a loudspeaker.</p>
      <p>It will be able to carry up to two nano SIM cards along with NFC and Bluetooth capabilities.</p>
