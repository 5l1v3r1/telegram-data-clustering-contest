      <h1>Bordeaux's ballsy reaction to Radradra's departure: 'No one is irreplaceable'</h1>

      <p>Bordeaux boss Christophe Urios has claimed no player is irreplaceable after <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/semi-radradra-joins-bristol-bears/">Bristol announced the signing on Wednesday of Semi Radradra</a> for the next three seasons.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sudouest.fr/2019/11/29/ubb-nul-n-est-irremplacable-dit-christophe-urios-apres-le-depart-annonce-de-semi-radradra-6894261-773.php">Speaking to www.sudouest.fr</a> two days after the move was confirmed, the Top 14 club’s boss admitted they didn’t even try to compete with Bristol’s offer which is reportedly an annual salary of £500,000.</p>
      <p>“We knew it could happen,” said Urios about the possibility of the former NRL star moving on from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> at the end of this season. “I will take pleasure in training throughout the year. No one is irreplaceable.</p>
      <p>“He is a very good player, but the strength of the club, of a squad, is that. He made his choice and it’s good that he did it early. There was not even any discussion with us. There would not have been any because it goes beyond the athlete.</p>
      <p>“I said we would not engage with the president until I knew (what he was up to). He did not wait until I knew completely to get involved. But I have no regrets because we could not have aligned.</p>

      <p>“At some point, you have to keep a coherence, you can’t do anything. And these [finances] are areas that go beyond us. This is the evolution of rugby.”</p>
      <p>Despite Radradra’s departure in summer 2021, Urios remains confident for Bordeaux’s future. “When we lost Antione Dupont at Castres, it hurt us. But we were champions the year after.</p>
      <p>“No one is irreplaceable. You just have to anticipate things, work well. Now, Semi has a great season to do with us and we have every interest in accompanying him well. I’m glad it’s settled.”</p>
