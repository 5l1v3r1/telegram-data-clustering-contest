      <p>REUTERS: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion forward Aaron Connolly has recovered from a groin injury and will be available for Saturday's Premier League match at table-toppers Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland international picked up the injury during Brighton's 3-1 loss at Manchester United on Nov. 10 and missed international games against New Zealand and Denmark earlier this month.</p>

      <p>"Aaron Connolly is back in the squad and training now," Brighton manager Graham Potter told reporters.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old became the first teenager to start a Premier League game for Brighton when he featured in the 4-0 defeat by champions Manchester City in August, going on to appear in nine league games so far this season.</p>
      <p>He entered the record books again as their first teenage player to score in the competition, notching a brace in their 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in October.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile midfielder Solly March is doubtful, while defender Bernardo was ruled out of the clash.</p>
      <p>"We've got March who has a bit of tightness in his groin so he's doubtful at the moment for the weekend," Potter said.</p>
      <p>"Bernardo got his first 45 minutes last night (Wednesday) but Saturday will come a bit too soon for him."</p>
