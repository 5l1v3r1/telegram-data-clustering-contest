      <h1>Adidas’ ISS-themed Ultraboost 20 has been revealed, and I want a pair</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:41:37+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/nic/" target="_blank">Nic Ker</a></address>
      <p>I’m not sure if this is fate. I was recently engaged in a long discussion with a friend over the comfort levels of different models of shoes, and he repeatedly told me that his comfort shoes of choice were actually running shoes from Adidas—specifically, the Ultraboost series. Fast-forward a few days, and I find out that Adidas has announced the latest pair in the series: the Ultraboost 20.</p>
      <p>What’s cool about the upcoming Ultraboost shoes is that they are actually being launched in partnership with the International Space Station(ISS) U.S. National Laboratory. This means that elements of the Ultraboost 20 have been inspired by the construction of a space shuttle, and the look of the running shoes match this burgeoning partnership.</p>
      <p>Adidas says that their partnership with the International Space Station(ISS) U.S. National Laboratory will help them to “innovate, learn, and share information with the vision of co-creating the future of sports performance.”</p>

      <p>But what’s really interesting is that the partnership could also see Adidas sending Boost technology on a mission up to the International Space Station.</p>
      <blockquote>“In space, the scientists will study the Boost molding process without the distraction of Earth’s gravity, so adidas can unlock the future of boost. The objective is to leverage the findings at scale in Boost midsoles of the future.”</blockquote>
      <p>And the Ultraboost 20 features a ISS U.S. National Laboratory space patch—which pays tribute to the partnership, and is also a “commitment” of both partners to innovate. And if sending a pair of Adidas shoes to space don’t sound out-of-this-world to you, I don’t know what would.</p>

      <p>Judging from the images, there are two colours available—grey, and black. Both feature purplish soles that look similar to other Ultraboost shoes, and Adidas says that they will be dropping a number of limited-edition colour options in the lead-up to the official launch: December 6th 2019.</p>
      <p>I don’t know what I’m more excited for. A pair of shoes that wouldn’t look out of place on an actual space shuttle <i>in space</i>, or the space mission-looking case that houses the Adidas Ultraboost 20.</p>
      <p>Either way, damn. I’d love to have a pair.</p>
