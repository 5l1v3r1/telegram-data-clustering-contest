      <p>A brute who stabbed a vulnerable hospital patient and a healthcare worker has been jailed for two years.</p>
      <p>Kenneth Wrethman, 43, armed himself with cutlery at the Royal Alexandra Hospital and repeatedly attacked staff member Carol Crawford as well as attempting to stab a dementia patient she was helping.</p>
      <p>Paisley Sheriff Court heard Wrethman had been admitted to the acute medical centre at the RAH for treatment after exhibiting bizarre symptoms, including behaving erratically, appearing angry and talking to himself.</p>

      <p>He pleaded guilty to assaulting Ms Crawford and her patient by repeatedly striking both with a knife.</p>
      <p>The court heard patients at the unit were having lunch when Wrethman suddenly flipped out and seized a knife from a dinner plate.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Keri Marshall said: “Ms Crawford was working in her capacity as a healthcare assistant and was assisting a patient to eat his lunch by feeding him.</p>
      <p>“Another patient was finished eating and placed his dinner knife on his plate.</p>
      <p>“Within seconds, the accused took the knife off the plate and approached Ms Crawford, armed with the knife.</p>
      <p>“The accused said to her ‘I have got something for you,’ before striking her repeatedly on her left side with the knife.</p>
      <p>“The knife struck the wire in her bra and stopped her being struck directly on the body.”</p>
      <p>Ms Crawford scrambled free from Wrethman’s attack and bravely jumped in between the accused and her patient in an attempt to defend him.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor added: “The accused was trying to strike the patient with the knife.</p>
      <p>“Ms Crawford managed to get in front of the accused, however, he eventually managed to overpower her.</p>
      <p>“He pushed her out of the way before striking the patient on his left shoulder.</p>
      <p>“The accused caused grazes and bruises to the patient.”</p>

      <p>Defence agent Stephen Maguire said Wrethman had no recollection of the event and believed he had been spiked with illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Mr Maguire said: “He cannot provide any details.</p>
      <p>“His recollection of events is non-existent.</p>
      <p>“He was given medication at hospital and the next thing he remembers is being in Low Moss.</p>
      <p>“He felt he had been spiked at some point but what it was or who is responsible or whatever drug was involved, will never be known.”</p>
      <p>The lawyer added Wrethman felt “disgusted” at himself for what he had done.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Tom McCartney handed him a two-year stretch, saying: “Each of these crimes were violent offences involving the use of a knife.</p>
      <p>“The assaults are made more serious by where they took place.</p>
      <p>“They are made even more serious by the fact the victims were a health care assistant working in the course of employment, and a vulnerable patient.”</p>
