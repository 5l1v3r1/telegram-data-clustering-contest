      </p>
      <p>Bennet von Vertes, 34, was cleared of the manslaughter of Alex Morgan after he claimed a cocaine and ketamine binge made him think his friend was a green alien.</p>

      <p>He was originally locked up for 12 and a half years - but has now had his sentenced cut to three years after his lawyers won an appeal arguing he was not sound of mind.</p>
      <p>It means he will go free after time already served.</p>
      <p>Alex's devastated mother Katja Faber said last night she felt "horrified and sick" after learning Von Vertes would be released.</p>

      <p>She said: "They are giving him his freedom because he was so high he did not know what he was doing.</p>
      <p>"But what kind of excuse is that? It's crazy.</p>
      <p>"My darling Alex was a kind, intelligent son who deserved a good life.</p>
      <p>"At least when his killer was convicted it gave us some sense of justice. But this has turned my whole world back upside down."</p>
      <p>Von Vertes' defence claimed that a cocktail of sleeping tablets, cocaine and ketamine led to the art dealer flying into a psychotic rage in Zurich in December 2014.</p>
      <p>His lawyers claimed he'd seen his victim as an alien with a green face, red eyes and long ears who he thought was trying to kill him.</p>
      <p>The two men had met at Regent's University in London, where Alex had recently finished a business management degree.</p>
      <p>Alex, who went top Prince Charles' old boarding school Gordonstoun, met up with Von Vertes in Zurich while on an Alpine skiing holiday.</p>
      <p>The original trial in Meilen heard how the killer had invited his friend to his parents' villa in the posh lakeside area of Kuesnacht.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>At least when his killer was convicted it gave us some sense of justice. But this has turned my whole world back upside down<cite>Katja Faber, victim Alex Morgan's mum</cite></blockquote>
      <p>They spent the night out in the city and returned to the villa at about 4am before the fight broke out.</p>
      <p>In a drug-addled rage, von Vertes stabbed Mr Morgan with shards of glass, bashed him with a 3ft candlestick and a golden sculpture and rammed the candlestick down his throat, choking him to death.</p>
      <p>The Court President in Zurich said: "There was an orgy of violence on the night of the attack. The living room looked like a grotesque battlefield. The accused had left a Saint Nicolas doll on the body of his friend.</p>
      <p>"The defendant's alleged psychosis could not be disputed by the court in the appeal."</p>
      <p>Von Vertes' conviction was downgraded to the lesser charge of "negligent killing" and he will be released after undergoing therapy for his addictions.</p>
      <p>Von Vertes was also found guilty of raping a woman in a hotel room in London two months before the killing, as well as a range of sexual assaults.</p>
      <p>However, three judges at Zurich's supreme court found he was unaware of what he was doing, and also cleared him of the rape.</p>
