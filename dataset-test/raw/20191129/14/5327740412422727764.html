      <h1>Poppy campaign raises $125,000 in South Surrey, White Rock</h1>
      <h2>Funds benefit veterans and their families, poppy co-chair notes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:30:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/tracy-holmes/" target="_blank">Tracy Holmes</a></address>
      <p>More than $120,000 was raised on the Semiahmoo Peninsula through this year’s poppy campaign.</p>
      <p>Officials with the White Rock and Crescent Beach legions confirmed the totals – $95,000 and “more than $30,000,” respectively – on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>At the Crescent Beach legion, Branch 240, the funds raised were a 25 per cent jump over last year, when $24,000 was recorded.</p>
      <p>“We did quite well,” campaign co-chair Percy Smith said.</p>
      <p>Smith attributed the boost to volunteers putting in more hours; and, the extra weekend hours that cadet groups pitched in.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As well, “people showed a little more interest in donating this year.”</p>
      <p>Smith, who served in the Second World War, from 1942-46, says he spent 125 hours selling poppies during the campaign; sometimes, up to eight hours in a day.</p>
      <p>It’s an impressive effort, considering his 96 years.</p>
      <p>Legion volunteers numbered around 25, said Smith. The money collected “is well-spent,” he added, noting the Peace Arch zone as a whole collected more than $1 million this year.</p>
      <p>“The money mostly goes for helping out veterans and their families,” Smith said.</p>
      <p>Smith said elsewhere in Surrey, around $100,000 was raised by the Cloverdale legion and $60,000 was raised in Whalley.</p>

      <p>For White Rock, the $95,000 raised was a bit less than the $100,000 they’d hoped for, but on par with last year, the legion’s Gail Green told <i>Peace Arch News</i>.</p>
      <p>And, “all that money helps our veterans,” she added.</p>
      <p>Green said close to 100 volunteers pitched in to help with the Branch 8 campaign, with some logging hours every day.</p>
