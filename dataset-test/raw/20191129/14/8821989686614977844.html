      <h1>James Hetfield to Publish Book About His Classic Cars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:13:06+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/metallica/">Metallica</a> frontman <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/james-hetfield/">James Hetfield</a> has written a book about his collection of classic cars, publisher Insight Editions announced.</p>
      <p>Titled <i>Reclaimed Rust: The Four-Wheeled Creations of James Hetfield</i>, the 192-page work celebrates his fascination with rebuilding vehicles. It’s to be launched on May 5, 2020 and is available for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reclaimed-Rust-Four-Wheeled-Creations-Hetfield/dp/168383805X">pre-order</a> now, priced $50.</p>
      <p>“Millions know James Hetfield as the front man of Metallica, but the acclaimed singer-songwriter has enjoyed another lifelong passion: restoring and customizing classic cars into magnificent pieces of automotive art,” said a statement from Insight, publishers of 2016 Metallica book <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/metallica-back-to-the-front-book/"><i>Back to the Front</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“From cars such as the Skyscraper to the Aquarius and the Black Pearl, James Hetfield’s collection of beautifully reimagined classic automobiles is truly stunning. For the first time, Hetfield is opening up his garage and inviting readers to dive under the hood of some of these internationally lauded classics. Featuring dynamic, specially commissioned photography of the cars and insight from Hetfield into their creation, this book is a unique opportunity to learn about the Metallica front man's passion for creating bespoke classic cars.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.petersen.org/hetfield">Petersen Automotive Museum</a> in L.A. recently confirmed that the vehicle collection would be on display from next February until October. “While the vast majority of collectors acquire vehicles by purchasing pre-existing examples, Hetfield elected instead to build his from scratch, channeling creativity often reserved for his music into the production of rolling sculptures,” the museum announced.</p>
      <p>“Hetfield, a lifelong car enthusiast, has described seeing cars in the same way he sees music: as forms of freedom and expression that convey the passions of their creator. At once classic and modern, Hetfield’s vehicles assert both a reverence for history and a disregard for convention, standing collectively as a testament to the musician’s distinctive personality and artistic energy.”</p>

      <h3>11: 'Lulu' (2011)</h3>
      <p>We weren't sure whether or not to count <i>Lulu</i>, the band's collaboration with the legendary Lou Reed, as a proper Metallica studio album. But, once we decided to do so, there was no question where it would rank on this list. Both parties deserve a lot of respect for trying something so different. But the end result – this plodding spoken-word mess – is really hard to sit through.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>10: 'St. Anger' (2003)</h3>
      <p>Metallica again bravely, but perhaps misguidedly, experimented here with the methods that made them the biggest metal band in the world. The high-tech production of Metallica's previous albums is replaced with something much more grainy and shrill. Oh, and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/kirk-hammett/">Kirk Hammett</a> wasn't allowed to play any guitar solos. But the biggest problem? The disjointed and bloated songwriting, which ultimately wasted a big bundle of tantalizing riffs.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>9: 'Reload' (1997)</h3>
      <p>This is the follow up / companion to 1996's <i>Load</i>, which was originally planned to be a double album. Everything from here on out is unquestionably worth your money – in this case, thanks to songs like "Fuel," "Devil's Dance" and the manic "Prince Charming." But as <i>Reload</i> stretches past the 75-minute mark, it's hard not to hear some of the songs as leftovers.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>8: 'Death Magnetic' (2008)</h3>
      <p>Metallica makes a long-awaited return to their thrash roots, with epic, immaculately crafted compositions reminescent of their earlier masterpieces. Make no mistake, it's a blast to listen to. Still, <i>Death Magnetic</i> just doesn't stick as strongly in your head as the landmark records we'll discuss later in this gallery.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>7. 'Hardwired... to Self-Destruct' (2016)</h3>
      <p>Eight years after 'Death Magnetic,' Metallica returned with a looser, fuller sound on 'Hardwired... to Self-Destruct.' It features their best collection of riffs in decades, and several songs that should earn a spot on the band's "all-time" playlist. However, after a very strong start the second half gets a bit bogged down with plodding, repetitive tempos and over-baked ideas.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>6: 'Load' (1996)</h3>
      <p>After stripping the Metallica sound down to a bare minimum with their world-conquering Black Album, the band loosened things up just a bit – adding a dose of Southern boogie to songs like "Ain't My Bitch" and "2 X 4." Mix two-thirds of this one with about one-third of <i>Reload</i>, and you've got an undeniable classic.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/08/5-And-Justice-for-All-1988.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>5: 'And Justice For All' (1988)</h3>
      <p>Just about any other metal band would be proud to call this album their signature work. But the thin production remains a big sticking point, and the somewhat repetitive songwriting betrays the fact that this is the third time Metallica followed roughly the same formula in crafting an album.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/08/4-Metallica-1991.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>4: 'Metallica' (1991)</h3>
      <p>Metallica perhaps understandably shifted their songwriting style drastically on the follow up to 1988's <i>And Justice For All</i>. Some fans missed the thrash riffs and complex song structures that made them metal pioneers. But Metallica made 80-bajillion or so new fans who followed them into this more straight-ahead hard-rock territory, and they're unquestionably right about songs like "Enter Sandman" and "Sad But True."</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>3: 'Ride the Lightning' (1984)</h3>
      <p>We're now left with a tight, three-album horse race between undisputed masterpieces. In fact, <i>Ride the Lightning</i> could easily top this list. Metallica confidently and dramatically expanded the sound of their debut album, which was barely a year old at the time. Highlights include the pummeling "Creeping Death," the dramatic "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and their terrifically warped version of a power ballad, "Fade to Black."</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/08/2-Kill-Em-All-1983.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>2: 'Kill 'Em All' (1983)</h3>
      <p>By comparison, <i>Kill 'Em All</i> seems a bit raw and unhinged – but, in this case, that's not a bad thing at all. Unlike <i>St. Anger</i>, this time around the dazzling combination of speed and precision on songs like "Hit the Lights" and "Jump in the Fire" hits even harder, thanks to the lack of production.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/08/1-Master-of-Puppets-1986.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>1: 'Master of Puppets' (1986)</h3>
      <p>It may not have matched the huge steps forward made by their last two albums, but this time out Metallica refined what they already had proved they could do in the sharpest and most powerful ways imaginable. There's not a wasted second on any of this album's eight songs. It would take another half decade for the world to realize it, but in reality <i>Master of Puppets</i> – and not the Black Album – is the album that made Metallica the still-reigning kings of heavy metal.</p>
