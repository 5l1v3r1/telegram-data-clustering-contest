      <h1>This Morning's Alison Hammond's gaffe while speaking about I'm A Celebrity's Caitlyn Jenner</h1>
      <h2>The entertainment reporter had to be corrected by ITV show host Ruth Langsford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:19:45+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Sansome, https://www.facebook.com/jesssansomejournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Alison Hammond has come under fire from <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/this-morning">This Morning</a> viewers for accidentally misgendering I'm A Celebrity star Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star is currently starring in the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> shows 19th series and roving entertainment reporter Alison was discussing the latest goings on in the jungle with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford.</p>
      <p>But when she went to praise Caitlyn, 70, on how well she was doing, she slipped up and referred to the Jenner matriarch as "he".</p>
      <p>Not noticing her own mistake, it was Ruth who then quickly corrected her co-star and loudly said "she" as Alison continued to talk about the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old was talking about how Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have claimed Caitlyn as an honorary Geordie after her attempts at the accent when they visit camp.</p>
      <p>"He keeps coming out with these Geordie sayings every time Ant and Dec come into the jungle," she said. "So he's officially a Geordie."</p>

      <p>Viewers of the daytime favourite were less than impressed with the mistake and made their feelings known on social media.</p>
      <p>A few said: "Alison Hammond has an apology to make there I reckon #ThisMorning."</p>
      <p>"@AlisonHammond misgendering @Caitlyn_Jenner on #thismorning twice! Awful," another commented. "Well done @RuthieeL for correcting her!!"</p>
      <p>A fourth said: "Alison just misgendered Caitlyn Jenner live on This Morning."</p>

      <p>Some jumped to her defence.</p>
      <p>"As suspected people are really coming for Alison, it was a mistake, it happens, yes perhaps an apology is needed but I have huge issue with this soap box, sack people culture, it’s horrible. I feel like Caitlyn will just shrug it off with a hug. #ThisMorning," tweeted a viewer.</p>

      <p>Another said: "Oh dear poor Alison #ThisMorning #fauxpas."</p>
      <p>Whilst Caitlyn is now best known for being part of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, the former Olymic-gold medal winning decathlete stole the headlines in 2015 when she appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine to announce that she had transitioned from Bruce Jenner into Caitlyn.</p>
