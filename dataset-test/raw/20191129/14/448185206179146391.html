      <p><b>Kolkata:</b> With the hike in prices of Onion up to Rs 100 per kilo in West Bengal, onions have seemingly become more alluring for thieves than cash, in a shocking incident; a vegetable seller’s shop was burgled in the state’s East Midnapore district recently.</p>
      <p>Akshay Das, who has a shop in Sutahata, found things scattered all around when he opened his outlet on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Realizing that thieves could have sneaked into the shop on Monday night, Das was in for a shock when he counted his losses.</p>
      <p>While the money kept in the cash box was intact, several sacks containing onions were missing from the shop.</p>
      <p>According to Das, the thieves had escaped with onions worth Rs 50,000, besides some garlic and ginger.</p>
      <p>“They didn’t take a single paisa from the cash box,” he said.</p>
