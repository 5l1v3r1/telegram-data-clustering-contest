      <h1>Black Friday SSD deals 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:34:52+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/phil-savage/" target="_blank">Phil Savage</a></address>
      <p>Remember when SSDs cost $1+ per gigabytes? My, how times have changed. SSDs today aren't just affordable. With this year's Black Friday SSD deals, Newegg and Amazon are selling off storage cheaper than it's been all year. You can easily find a 1TB SSD for under $100, get a smaller drive for dirt cheap, or go large with a discounted SSD up to 4TB.</p>
      <p>If you're looking to upgrade your existing SATA Solid State Drive to a faster NVMe, or you're trying to ditch that older HDD that's slowing down game loads, now is very much the time to get involved. The price of SSDs has been dropping all year, but Black Friday always sees retailers knocking a few extra dollars / quid off the price, to tempt you in. And considering how big today's games are, we could all use the extra space.</p>

      <p>We are officially into Black Friday, where we're seeing better (and more) deals crop up than the earlier ones over the last couple of weeks. Today is when most retailers save their best deals, but there's no guarantee that your chosen SSD will be included, or that it will still be in stock.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for the absolute best deal, time's a tickin', so if you see something you like out of the best deals we've found so far, jump on that like a kid on a trampoline. You can take a little bit of time though, with Cyber Monday just around the corner on December 2.  Current Black Friday deals will run right into those, and will also likely run until Christmas. There might be fewer at that point, but if you miss out on Black Friday, don't fret quite yet.</p>
      <h4>How to save money on SSDs during Black Friday</h4>

      <p>You can expect to see a lot of price cuts this November, so how can you be sure you're actually getting a good Black Friday deal? While we'll be searching out the best possible deals during the event itself, there are also a handful of common sense tips that will help make the process feel less overwhelming.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Check the price history</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every retailer will be touting its massive price cuts, but are those discounts as good as advertised? Sites like CamelCamelCamel can help you check. As well as letting you easily compare the price of a selected drive across many different sites, it also gives you access to its price history. A common trick is to display massive discounts based on the manufacturer recommended price—a price that drive may not have actually been sold at for years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Do the research</b>
      </p>
      <p>Does your motherboard have an M.2 slot? Will your most played games all fit onto a 1TB SSD? How much are you willing to spend on extra storage? It's worth taking some time to find out what you need or want, and what drives would help you achieve that. Some flexibility will help you get the best deal, but it's also worth setting a budget to ensure that you're not spending slightly more on a good deal for a drive you don't actually need.</p>
