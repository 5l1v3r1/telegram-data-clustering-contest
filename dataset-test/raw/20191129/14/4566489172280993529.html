      <h1>Costly holiday tree scandalises Russian coal town</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:30:12+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>An expensive holiday tree installed in the centre of an industrial Siberian city has been ridiculed online and on national media as a symbol of corruption, though authorities defended the high-tech purchase.</p>
      <p>The 25-metre (80-foot) artificial tree in Kemerovo, a city surrounded by coal mines, cost 18 million rubles ($280,000), three times more than the country's main tree installed in the Kremlin.</p>
      <p>Russian comedian Ivan Urgant, who hosts a show on popular Channel One, ridiculed the Kemerovo tree as having "very expensive ornaments -- real rabbits, bears, cars and planes" and hinted at corruption in the city hall.</p>
      <p>The city made national headlines last winter when residents reported seeing black snow due to large amounts of coal dust, while a town nearby covered a snow hill used for sledding with white paint to hide the coal residue.</p>
      <p>"Here people don't really live, they survive. And they are spending 18 million on a tree!" local resident Roman Khabibulin wrote angrily on social network VK.</p>
      <p>"It's as stupid as buying the latest iPhone when your children have nothing to eat," wrote another VK user, Ivan Lebedev.</p>
      <p>Online commentators suggested that authorities direct the money toward children with cancer or subsidised housing instead.</p>
      <p>Kemerovo's mayor defended the purchase, saying it was a "mid-range" technological tree that would replace an old tree which became too expensive to repair.</p>
      <p>The new tree is made of steel and has 239,000 LED lights, he boasted.</p>
      <p>The company that supplied the tree, Sibevrostroy, denied the price was inflated.</p>
      <p>"This product cannot be called a tree," director Andrei Zorin told news agency Interfax. "It's a high-tech multimedia complex which happens to look like a tree."</p>
      <p>Communist Party spokesman Alexander Yushchenko said the tree was "just an element of the whole system, our national problem, corruption."</p>
      <p>Russians put up trees to celebrate New Year, which is the country's biggest holiday of the year and sees cities spending significant sums on decorations and fireworks.</p>
      <p>Celebration of the Russian Orthodox Christmas, which falls on January 7, was discouraged during the Soviet era and remains less popular than New Year's.</p>
