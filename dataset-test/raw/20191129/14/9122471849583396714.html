      <h1>ESPN Releases Final Prediction For Today’s Iowa-Nebraska Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:29:51+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Although neither team has a chance to clinch a spot in the Big Ten Championship this season, there’s a lot at stake for today’s Iowa-Nebraska game.</p>
      <p>Iowa is seeking its second-straight season with at least nine wins. Kirk Ferentz continues to lead one of the best defenses in football, which only surrenders 12.2 points per game.</p>
      <p>Nebraska started the season with a 4-2 record, but Scott Frost’s squad has struggled down the stretch. However, the Cornhuskers are coming off an impressive 52-7 win over the Maryland Terrapins.</p>
      <p>The Cornhuskers haven’t been great on defense this season, yet the offense has put up prolific numbers this season. Adrian Martinez will need to play his best football of the year in order to pick up the win.</p>
      <p>Not only is Nebraska looking for its first win over Iowa in over four years, the program is hoping to be bowl eligible for the first time since 2017.</p>
      <p>Judging off ESPN’s final prediction, it appears the Cornhuskers may have to wait another year to make a postseason appearance.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401112200">Football Power Index</a>, Iowa has a 70.3 percent chance of defeating Nebraska this afternoon.</p>
