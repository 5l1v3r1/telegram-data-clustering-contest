      <p><b>Mubasher:</b> India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that New Delhi will lend Sri Lanka a $400 million line of credit to finance infrastructure projects, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>India would extend $50 million in loan for Sri Lanka, for its security needs, along with $400 million for developing infrastructure, Premier Modi said.</p>
      <p>“India is fully committed to the development of Sri Lanka,” Modi was quoted by Reuters.</p>
      <p>Modi’s announcement came after talks with the Asian nation’s new president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was in a visit to India after a sweeping election victory earlier this month.</p>
      <p>President Rajapaksa said he is willing to take bilateral relations with India to a “very high level.”</p>
