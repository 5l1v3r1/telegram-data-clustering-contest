      <p>iDB’s video editor Harris Craycraft has been using the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/13/official-16-inch-macbook-pro/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> for a little while – long enough to compile a list of what he really likes about it. In this YouTube video, Harris talks about his five favorite features of the new MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is the very first Apple laptop to come in 16-inch form factor. They’ve been doing 15-inch models since the PowerBook days, and Apple offered 17-inch for a while before the Retina display era took over. But 16-inch is new – not only is the screen bigger, but there are a lot more pixels, too. That’s not the only change under the hood, either.</p>

      <p>Harris loves the new keyboard. That’s definitely been one of the standout features of the new MacBook Pro – it includes a mechanism that’s very different than the last few MacBook Pro models. In fact, Apple calls it a Magic Keyboard – the same nomenclature it uses to describe the keyboard that comes with the iMac (and which Apple sells as an accessory for other Macs).</p>
      <p>Apple generally equips its larger laptop model with premium features that benefit pro users demanding absolute peak performance from their Mac laptop. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is no exception, and its price tag comes in the same as the model it replaced, making it a better value than before. Under the hood you’ll find a ninth-generation Intel Core processor and speedy Radeon Pro graphics from AMD.</p>
      <p>We won’t spoil the rest of what Harris has to say – just click on the video and stream it to see for yourself.</p>
