      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has refused to deny that he would have become <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a>’s manager before he replaced Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed as Pochettino’s successor last week but the 56-year-old <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/arsenal-dines-jose-mourinho-pressure-builds-unai-emery-11033365/">reportedly held talks with Arsenal’s head of football Raul Sanllehi last month about potentially replacing Emery</a>.</p>
      <p>Reports also claim that Mourinho was wanted by more than one senior person at Arsenal to become Emery’s replacement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/29/arsenal-sack-unai-emery-eintracht-frankfurt-europa-league-defeat-11238198/">Arsenal have now decided to sack Emery</a> and have confirmed that Freddie Ljungberg, who was already a member of the first-team coaching staff, will be their interim replacement.</p>

      <p>When asked if he would have taken the Arsenal job before Tottenham’s offer, Mourinho replied: ‘No point in telling you.</p>
      <p>‘I’m so happy here I cannot think of the possibility of another club.</p>

      <p>‘If you put any other club in the world in front of me now I’d say no.’</p>
      <p>Mourinho also paid a special tribute to Emery and described the Spaniard as a ‘fantastic coach with a proven record’.</p>
      <p>‘It’s always sad news,’ said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘I felt it as a kid, when my dad was sacked as a manager, I’ve felt it myself when I have been sacked previously.</p>
      <p>‘There’s not one single manager who is sacked that I’m happy with. I always feel a deja vu situation.</p>

      <p>‘I’m sad for it but that’s life.</p>
      <p>‘Unai is a fantastic coach, not happy at Arsenal, obviously, but a fantastic coach with a proven record.</p>
      <p>‘A little bit of a rest [and] another big club will come for him and his career will be back on track.</p>
      <p>‘So no dramas mi amigo, keep going and you will get another club.’</p>
