      <p>“Zurich International has been selected as a successful company as it offered the best price,” said NIAL’s Chief Executive Officer Arun Vir Singh. “Now the project would go to project monitoring and implementation committee that will meet on December 2 for required paperwork and then UP Cabinet will complete the process.” This was “a historic day as it will boost growth in this region”, Singh added.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/aviation/zurich-airport-to-develop-delhis-second-airport-at-jewar-4789571.htm">CRISIL Infrastructure Advisory</a> Director Jagannarayan Padmanabhan told CNBC-TV18 that it was important to give the concessionaire “an unencumbered site for development” at the earliest. “Also imperative that the overall aviation growth trajectory comes back to low teens at the earliest,” he added.</p>
      <p>Zurich International had developed the Kempegowda International airport in Bengaluru in partnership with other companies, and exited the project in 2017. It has also developed eight airports in Latin America. “We are happy to work in Uttar Pradesh as this region has a huge potential,” said Zurich Airport Chief Executive Officer Daniel Bircher. “This region has infrastructure, traffic and big catchment area.”</p>
