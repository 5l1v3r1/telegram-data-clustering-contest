      <p>Tottenham Hotspur boss Jose Mourinho has presided over two wins from his two games in charge so far and will be looking to make it three on the spin in his first home Premier League match since taking charge.</p>
      <p>His new side held off a late comeback to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/west-ham-united-vs-spurs_game_92634.html">beat West Ham United 3-2</a> in his opening fixture, before being forced to battle back from behind themselves in order to claim <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/spurs-vs-olympiacos_game_96729.html">a 4-2 victory over Olympiacos</a> last time out in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Spurs are still down in 10th in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">the Premier League table</a> despite their victory over the Hammers, and will be hoping to start closing the nine-point gap to fourth-placed Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However, Tottenham have a difficult run of fixtures coming up, as they face Manchester United at Old Trafford, Bayern Munich in Germany, Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux and host Chelsea in four of the five fixtures that follow their game with Bournemouth.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eddie-howe/"><b>Eddie Howe</b></a>'s side will not be relishing their trip to London to face Spurs, as they are currently struggling for form and have slipped down the table after a strong start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Cherries are back into the bottom half in 11th following 2-1 defeats to both <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/newcastle-united-vs-bournemouth_game_92620.html">Newcastle United away</a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/bournemouth-vs-wolves_game_92625.html">Wolves at home</a> in their last two games.</p>
      <p>And they will be facing the highest-scoring team outside the current top four in a fixture that they, historically, have found little joy in.</p>
      <p>The Cherries did win their last game against Spurs 1-0 after two red cards for the north Londoners, but have lost six of the other seven Premier League meetings (drawing the other), and have conceded four or more goals in four of those six defeats.</p>

      <p>Tottenham head coach Mourinho has four senior players ruled out of Saturday's fixture, including two long-term absentees.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erik-lamela/"><b>Erik Lamela</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michel-vorm/"><b>Michel Vorm</b></a> are unavailable, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hugo-lloris/"><b>Hugo Lloris</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ben-davies/"><b>Ben Davies</b></a> will be out for an extended period of time.</p>
      <p>However, the Portuguese's injury woes pale in comparison with the list Bournemouth boss Howe must contend with.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joshua-king/"><b>Joshua King</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charlie-daniels/"><b>Charlie Daniels</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-brooks/"><b>David Brooks</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/junior-stanislas/"><b>Junior Stanislas</b></a> are all sidelined with injuries, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/simon-francis/"><b>Simon Francis</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/phillip-billing/"><b>Phillip Billing</b></a> are both suspended and are also unavailable.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there are doubts over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andrew-surman/"><b>Andrew Surman</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lloyd-kelly/"><b>Lloyd Kelly</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dominic-solanke/"><b>Dominic Solanke</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-fraser/"><b>Ryan Fraser</b></a> as well.</p>
      <p><b>Tottenham Hotspur possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Gazzaniga; Aurier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Rose; Dier, Winks; Lucas, Alli, Son; Kane</p>
      <p><b>Bournemouth possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Ramsdale; Smith, S. Cook, Mepham, Ake, Rico; H. Wilson, L. Cook, Lerma, Danjuma; C. Wilson</p>

      <h3>We say: Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 Bournemouth</h3>
      <p>Tottenham have an excellent track record against Bournemouth, who are plagued by injuries and suspensions and have lost their last two. It should be a simple third victory for Mourinho - and possibly a first clean sheet, given that the Cherries have never scored against Spurs away from home.</p>
