        <i>The Post’s Howie Kussoy, aka the struggling Pigskin Profit, lets his soon-to-be 1-year-old daughter (Kid Profit) take a shot on four Friday college football games:</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>VIRGINIA CAVALIERS (+3) over Virginia Tech Hokies:</b> Before April, Virginia had never been to a Final Four. A win here would put the school in football’s ACC title game for the first time. Though the Hokies have won 15 straight games in the rivalry, The Kid only knows a world in which the Cavaliers play for championships.</p>
      <p><b>Iowa Hawkeyes (-5½) over NEBRASKA CORNHUSKERS:</b> Cornhuskers coach Scott Frost won’t bring his alma mater back to a bowl until next year. Just reaching the end zone against the Hawkeyes’ fifth-ranked defense would be a notable feat for Nebraska, which has lost its three games against ranked foes by an average of 28 points, as well as four straight against Iowa.</p>
      <p><b>Cincinnati Bearcats (+11) over MEMPHIS TIGERS:</b> I’d already dropped The Kid off at daycare when I realized I forgot to have her pick this game. It’s an appropriate metaphor for the Group of Five.</p>
      <p><b>COLORADO STATE RAMS (+13½) over Boise State Broncos:</b> The Broncos have won all eight meetings in the series and have lured nearly every bettor to their side, but laying so many points on the road won’t be so appealing if the expected snowfall arrives.</p>
