      <p>An angry mob has beaten to death, three suspected transformer vandals in Umuohiagu community of Ngor Okpala Local Government Area and Egbelu Obube community in Owerri North Local government area of Imo State, midnight Thursday.</p>
      <p>The suspected transformer vandals, Ifeanyi Mgbakabala, Kelechi Eke(aka Agwo) and one other whose identity is yet to be ascertained who allegedly specialize in vandalizing electricity transformers within the airport communities, were apprehended at Umuekwune kindred in Umuorisha village, attempting to vandalize the only remaining transformer in Umuohiagu.</p>

      <p>Witnesses claim they had already vandalized eight transformers in Umuohiagu alone in the past three months, effectively throwing the community into darkness. This was even as they also vandalized the dedicated cables being installed for the new radio house for the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, <a href="https://lailasnews.com/tag/owerri/">Owerri</a>.</p>
      <p>About four weeks ago, they claim that the suspects also vandalized the transformer at the permanent base of the Nigeria Air Force at nearby Umuowa community, a development that led to detention of the two Airforce personnel on guard for three weeks.</p>
      <p>It was further learned that following the several turns of vandalism, youth leaders in various villages had mobilised youths of the community when they learned of the new action at Umuekwune and alerted the Airforce men as they chased the suspects who ran into the surrounded area, but luck ran out on them, when the youths apprehended two of the culprits while one escaped.</p>
      <p>The suspects caught were dragged to the major road near the airport, where they were about being set ablaze before Airforce officers arrived the scene.</p>
      <p>Ifeanyi and Agwo were beaten and left near dead before being handed over to Nigeria Airforce personnel, where they gave up the ghost, the other suspect escaped to nearby Egbelu Obube community where he was reportedly set ablaze by the youths of the village.</p>
      <p>Before they were beaten to death, the suspects, had reportedly confessed to have used black magic to cause people around their target points, including the guards at the Airforce Base, to go into deep sleep while they vandalized the transformers and cables.</p>
