      <p>If you've been waiting patiently to get your hands on Intel's latest 10th Gen CPUs, HP's Notebook 15 not only delivers, it delivers big. It has inside a Core i7-10510U with four cores and a 4.9GHz clock speed for awesome performance, as well as integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics that does a respectable job for lightweight gaming. Combined with 8GB of DDR4-2666MHz RAM, this is a laptop that will easily handle all productivity work you throw its way. The only downside is the 15.6-inch HD display (768p compared to the more common 1080p) could be better, though if you're using it for office tasks and casual work it shouldn't matter as much.</p>
