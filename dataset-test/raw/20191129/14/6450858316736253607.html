      <h1>Bag a bargain in HP's sitewide Cyber Monday sale</h1>
      <h2>If you've been considering an HP product in the past, now is the perfect time to invest. The company is offering 15% off its entire store until the end of Cyber Monday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-02T13:14:00+00:00">02 Dec 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author">Anyron Copeman</a></address>
      <p>Rather than a specific Cyber Monday deal, how about money off the whole store? That's what HP has done, with its complete lineup of personal computing devices, printers and accessories currently available with 15% discounts.</p>
      <p><a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(21701)a(1544997)g(21288502)epi(06-3779219-11-0000000)url(https://store.hp.com/UKStore/merch/Offer.aspx?p=c-black-friday)">See the full range of HP discounts here</a>. </p>
      <p>Highlights include the stunning Spectre x360 convertible laptop, available for just over <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(21701)a(1544997)g(21288502)epi(06-3779219-11-0000000)url(https://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=7PZ50EA&amp;opt=ABU&amp;sel=NTB)">£1699</a> when you use the voucher code <b>BLK48</b> at checkout.</p>
      <p>As well as 360° hinge (hence the name) for maximum flexibility, the x360 is equipped with a gorgeous 15-inch 4K display and a quad speaker system tuned by audio masters Bang &amp; Olufsen. If that's not enough, there's even a built-in stylus to interact with the touchscreen Gorilla Glass display. Despite its thin and light design, long periods of gaming still shouldn't be a problem. </p>
      <p>We loved using it in our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/laptops/hp-spectre-x360-project-athena-3775955/">hands-on review</a>, At this price point, you want something that stands out, and we think the x360 ticks all the right boxes. This £300 saving makes it a genuine alternative to the likes of Dell's XPS 15, which is also heavily discounted for Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>However, its design is not for everyone. If you'd like a more traditional clamshell design, the HP Pavilion 15 is a great option. It has everything most people are looking for in a laptop, as well as some nice touches like fast charging and a backlit keyboard. </p>
      <p>The 15% discount makes it available for <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(21701)a(1544997)g(21288502)epi(06-3779219-11-0000000)url(https://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=8FD60EA&amp;opt=ABU&amp;sel=NTB)">£679.15</a>, provided you use the code <b>HPBLACK</b> at checkout.</p>
      <p>We're also big fans of the HP Sprocket, which allows you to wirelessly print your smartphone photos while on the go. At <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(21701)a(1544997)g(21288502)epi(06-3779219-11-0000000)url(https://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=1AS85A&amp;opt=638&amp;sel=PRN)">£68.99</a> with code <b>HPBLACK</b>, it's a great deal. </p>
      <p>These are just two of the wide-range of excellent HP gadgets at great prices. <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(21701)a(1544997)g(21288502)epi(06-3779219-11-0000000)url(https://store.hp.com/UKStore/merch/Offer.aspx?p=c-black-friday)">Check out the full range of HP discounts here</a>. </p>
