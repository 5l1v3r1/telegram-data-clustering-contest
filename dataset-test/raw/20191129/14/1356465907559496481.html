      <p>Happy Friday!</p>
      <p>This week, our research team tracked over 60 tech funding deals worth nearly €1 billion, as well as over 10 M&amp;A transactions, rumours, and related news stories across Europe, including Russia, Israel, and Turkey. Meanwhile, here’s an overview of the 10 biggest European tech news items for this week:</p>
      <p><b>1)</b> Picnic, the Dutch online supermarket, <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/picnic-mega-round/">has secured a €250 million financing round</a> to bankroll the building of a massive (42,000 square metre) automated distribution centre in Utrecht.</p>
      <p><b>2)</b> Vinted, a Lithuanian online used-clothing retailer, <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/vinted-minted-lithuanias-first-unicorn-as-the-second-hand-fashion-marketplace-raises-e128-million/">has raised €128 million euros (roughly $140 million) in a funding round</a> that valued it at more than €1 billion, making it the small Baltic nation’s first tech unicorn. The round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p>
      <p><b>3)</b> Uber has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/25/uber-loses-licence-london-tfl">lost its licence to operate private hire vehicles in London</a>, after authorities discovered that more than 14,000 trips were taken with uninsured drivers.
