      <p>“Just a few minutes ago I was walking across London Bridge on the south bank to the north bank of the bridge,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There appeared to be a fight going on on the other side of the bridge, with several men attacking one man.”</p>
      <p>Various social media users also reported hearing gunshots in the area.</p>
      <p>One video shows what appears to be police pulling equipment out of a vehicle nearby.</p>
      <p>Those in the video can be heard saying: “They’ve actually got guns out. They’ve got the guns out.”</p>
