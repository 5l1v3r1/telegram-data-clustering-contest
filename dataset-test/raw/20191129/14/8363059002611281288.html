      <p>At £150 the Fitbit Versa Lite was never particularly expensive, certainly not compared to some of the other watches in the Fitbit portfolio, but when the discounts come about we're not going to turn them away for no good reason. So if you fancied yourself a Fitbit watch but didn't want to spend a lot, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Fitness-Smartwatch-Battery-Resistance-Lilac/dp/B07MFZ9BY7?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;ascsubtag=trd-7751109044656867128-21">this is the perfect time to do it.</a></p>
      <p>The Versa Lite has never been so cheap now that Amazon has knocked £60 off the asking price in its Black Friday sale. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Fitness-Smartwatch-Battery-Resistance-Lilac/dp/B07MFZ9BY7?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;ascsubtag=trd-7751109044656867128-21">So now it's just £90,</a> which is basically stocking-filler money as far as tech is concerned.</p>

Just bear in mind this one does not have a heart rate monitor. That model <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitbit-Inspire-Auto-Exercise-Recognition-Tracking/dp/B07MM5W7Q8?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;ascsubtag=trd-9721129354536712239-21&amp;th=1">costs £73 at the moment.</a></p>
