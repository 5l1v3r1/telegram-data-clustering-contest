      <p>It comes after police quizzed a 44-year-old man, who has been released "pending further enquiries", after a fan was allegedly punched after the Seasiders' 3-1 defeat to Scunthorpe in the Leasing.com Trophy game on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Steve Rowlands took to Twitter following talks with the club this morning, and said: "The club has confirmed to me this morning that the steward who is the subject of a police investigation after Wednesday night will not work at Blackpool FC again."</p>
      <p>A club spokesman told The Gazette the steward was employed by an outside firm and confirmed he would not work at Bloomfield Road again.</p>
      <p>Blackpool FC said yesterday it was investigating "an incident that occurred on the concourse", while Lancashire Police also said it was "aware of a video circulating on social media relating to an alleged assault" and said officers were "looking into the matter".</p>
      <p>A six-second clip posted to Twitter showed a hooded man either bursting forward or being thrust forward towards stewards dressed in yellow vests and orange jackets.</p>
      <p>As he is pushed back, one steward, who has a security ID badge strapped to his arm, allegedly punches him in the side or back of the head.</p>
