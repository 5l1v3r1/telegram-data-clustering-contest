      <p>Taking place this weekend in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) capital, the final <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Formula%201/">Formula One</a> race this season is expected to be either boring, mainly because of Lewis Hamilton and the Mercedes-<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-aufrecht-melcher-grossaspach"><u>AMG</u></a> Petronas team <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/mercedes-ruins-rest-of-f1-season-as-it-takes-teams-title-drivers-win-certain-138255.html">having nothing else to prove</a>, or packed with action for exactly the same reason.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to bring the spotlight on the race and F1 in general, the Formula One Group has created its first-ever fragrance collection.</p>
      <p>Following a collaboration with Designer Parfums and visionary designer Ross Lovegrove, three limited editions of 3D printed fragrance bottles have been created, all of them being “<i>specifically inspired by the world of Formula 1, uniting technology and dynamism with heritage and storytelling</i>.”</p>
      <p>Not explaining exactly how, apparently five different fragrances are suspended in the three bottles, which are engulfed in H.R. Giger-like 3D printed exoskeletons.</p>
      <p>“<i>We are leveraging the sport’s heritage and principles to build a unique fragrance brand that merges a highly legitimate approach to the perfume world with the core values of Formula 1. Being the first fragrance brand to utilize 3D printing is a huge achievement, and we look forward to pushing this even further in future years when we will offer consumers the ability to create their own customized designs</i>,” said Dilesh Mehta, Designer Parfums Chairman &amp; CEO.</p>
      <p>Called Agile Embrace, which has a gold-plated exoskeleton, Fluid Symmetry (3D printed blasted titanium) and Compact Suspension, the three ingenious fragrance bottles will go on sale in March 2020, when the next F1 Championship begins. There was no mention of pricing or availability, but they certainly don't look like there were made for budget-conscious perfume lovers. 🏁</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>29 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>Formula 1® today announces an exciting collaboration with Designer Parfums, to create a unique fragrance collection, which will go on sale in March 2020.</p>
        <p>To mark the new collaboration, visionary designer Ross Lovegrove has created three exclusive limited edition pieces of 3D printed art which have been specifically inspired by the world of Formula 1, uniting technology and dynamism with heritage and storytelling. Suspended in these first-ever limited edition 3D prints we discover the beating heart of the project – a collection of five exquisite fragrances. These three designs will be on display and for sale (POA) in the Paddock Club at the FORMULA 1 ETIHAD AIRWAYS ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX 2019.</p>
        <p>The three different 3D printed designs on display are:</p>
        <p>AGILE EMBRACE – Based upon principles of form created from flow, the lines embrace the inner core that contains the heart of the design, made from 3D printed Gold plated.</p>
        <p>FLUID SYMMETRY – Derived from the evolving organic lines of the cars aerodynamic design, this conception is proof that the physics of natural forces in unison with advanced materials can produce a new form of technological bio aesthetic for the 21st Century, made from 3D Printed Blasted Titanium.</p>
        <p>COMPACT SUSPENSION – A space frame as an exoskeleton with layers that suspend the inner flask inside a 3D printed geometry that is strong and references the engineering of advanced innovative structures.</p>
        <p>Designer Ross Lovegrove utilises the latest digital light synthesis 3D printing technology, creating an intricate and stunning technopolymeric resin-based exoskeleton to house the fragrance bottle.</p>
        <p>From April 2020, the fragrances will start reaching retailers globally.</p>
        <p>Ellie Norman, Director of Marketing &amp; Communications, Formula, 1 said:</p>
        <p>“We are extremely excited to be working with Designer Parfums and Ross Lovegrove to unveil our new fragrance collection. The unique fragrances and bespoke F1 inspired bottles embody the dynamic qualities of the sport, and we are excited to launch the full collection early next year”.</p>
        <p>Dilesh Mehta, Designer Parfums Chairman &amp; CEO, said:</p>
        <p>“We are leveraging the sport’s heritage and principles to build a unique fragrance brand that merges a highly legitimate approach to the perfume world with the core values of Formula 1. Being the first fragrance brand to utilize 3D printing is a huge achievement, and we look forward to pushing this even further in future years when we will offer consumers the ability to create their own customized designs”</p>
