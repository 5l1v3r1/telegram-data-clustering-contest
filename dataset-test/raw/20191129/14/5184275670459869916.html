      <p>Talking about <i>Black Widow</i>, the film is the beginning of the new phase for the Marvel cinematic universe. The studio thus is giving it a big multilingual release in languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada in India.</p>
      <p>Considering the film gives the first look of the character and also her death in The <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> gives it the intrigue. While the film is an awaited one, if it gets a release similar to that of the Endgame is bound to make records and overshadow any film coming in its way.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Varun Dhawan and Sara Ali Khan starrer <i>Coolie No. 1</i> is a remake of the original one with the same name, which starred Govinda and Karisma Kapoor. The film also marks Varun Father David Dhawan’s return to direction.</p>
      <p><i>Coolie No. 1</i> is being shot now. Several pictures from the sets have gone viral. Recently we even heard about the incident where Varun almost encountering a near-death experience.</p>
