      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Daimler">Daimler</a> is to cut thousands more jobs worldwide in the next two years as it struggles to pay for the enormous costs of investing in electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> owner had already announced that a tenth of managers would be axed, but will now let go of at least a thousand administrative staff too.</p>
      <p>Assembly-line employees are not included in the latest figures. Daimler had previously agreed a jobs guarantee with workers’ representatives, which protects operational staff in Germany against compulsory redundancies until the end of 2029.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Daimler said it would reduce its headcount in a “socially responsible manner”, and use “natural fluctuation to cut jobs that become vacant”.</p>
      <p>The carmaker, which directly employs 130,000 people in Germany, added that voluntary redundancy packages will also be offered to those nearing retirement.</p>
      <p>The company, which says it will cut €1.4 billion in personnel costs, will seek to make further savings by offering its current workforce the option of reducing weekly working hours.</p>
      <p>“A reduction in capacity must not be carried out on the backs of employees,” warned Michael Brecht, chairman of Daimler’s works council.</p>
      <p>The council added that “the focus of personnel cost reduction must be on the improvement of processes and workflows.”</p>
      <p>Daimler’s latest announcement comes days after <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Audi">Audi</a> announced it was cutting almost 10,000 jobs, and reducing the production capacity at two of its main factories. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019</p>
