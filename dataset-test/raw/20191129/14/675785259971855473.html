      <h2>From Sunday (December 1), Netflix will no longer be supported on Samsung ’s 2010 and 2011 smart TVs, due to ‘technical limitations'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:57:08+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>It’s the go-to TV streaming service for many people, but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> will stop working on several popular TVs this weekend.</p>
      <p>From Sunday (December 1), Netflix will no longer be supported on Samsung ’s 2010 and 2011 smart TVs, due to ‘technical limitations.’</p>
      <p>Samsung explained: “Samsung was recently notified by Netflix that as of 1 December, the Netflix app will no longer be supported on selected 2010 and 2011 Smart TV models sold in Canada and the US.</p>
      <p>"For consumers with these models, there are still many other devices supported by Netflix that can be connected to a Smart TV in order to access the app.”</p>
      <p>And the changes don’t stop there - seven older Roku streaming sticks will also no longer be supported from this month.</p>
      <p>These include the Roku 2050X, Roku 2100X, Roku 2000C, Roku HD Player, Roku SD Player, Roku XR Player and Roku XD Player.</p>
      <p>Many users are annoyed about the change which could mean they’re forced to buy a new TV or streaming stick to continue watching Netflix.</p>
      <p>One user tweeted: “That’s pretty stupid and unfair. They will have to get a casting device now.” </p>
      <p>Another added: “So, basically what Netflix is saying is that on December 1 when I can’t access Netflix on my roku is that I need to cancel my subscription?”</p>
      <p>And one joked: “Me when Netflix isn’t supported on my Samsung smart TV any longer”, alongside a photo of Apple TV+ and Disney+.</p>
      <p>The update will take place on December 1 - so if you have one of the affected TVs or streaming sticks, you'll need to act fast!</p>
