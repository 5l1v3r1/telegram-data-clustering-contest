      <p>The <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/apprentice">Apprentice</a></i> star <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lottie-lion">Lottie Lion</a> has opened up about her insecurities, saying that she has “come to term with her unconventional looks”.</p>
      <p>Lion, a 19-year-old librarian from Somerset, recently became embroiled in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-lord-sugar-lottie-lion-jemelin-artigas-venezuala-race-bbc-a9206836.html">racism rows</a> regarding fellow contestants on the show.</p>
      <p>In October, it was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-lottie-lion-jemelin-artigas-racist-bbc-a9178981.html">reported</a> that Lion had allegedly referred to finance manager Lubna Farhan as “Gandhi” in a group Whatsapp chat, a statement that was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-lottie-lion-lubna-farhan-souleyman-bah-bbc-gandhi-alan-sugar-a9169876.html">condemned</a> by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BBC">BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Lion, who is still in the running to be named <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lord-sugar">Lord Sugar</a>‘s business partner, stated on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/twitter">Twitter</a> that comments she has been receiving on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/socialmedia">social media</a> have led to her “really struggling with confidence” over her appearance.</p>
      <p>“I came to terms with my unconventional looks before appearing on TV, I could have rhinoplasty, etc. but instead I gained the courage to be my natural self,” the reality television star said.</p>
      <p>“Now due to comments on social media, I am really struggling with confidence in my appearance. A reminder to be kind, always.”</p>
      <p>In a second tweet, Lion explained that she always edits photographs of herself that she posts on social media.</p>
      <p>“I post pictures of myself regularly, but they are all edited, none are of my genuine looks and it hurts that people attack me, particularly for my nose, size, weight, eyes. Think before you speak,” she said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Lord Sugar was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-lord-sugar-lottie-lion-jemelin-artigas-venezuala-race-bbc-a9206836.html">accused</a> of making an offensive comment that was reportedly cut from an episode of <i>The Apprentice</i>, in which he allegedly told Venezuelan contestant <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-episode-7-jemelin-artigas-fired-lord-alan-sugar-ryan-mark-thomas-a9201471.html">Jemelin Artigas</a>: “No wonder your country is in a state – it’s because it’s full of people like you.”</p>
      <p>Lion responded to an article about the controversy, tweeting that it was “fake news”.</p>
      <p>“On <i>The Apprentice</i>, if you were fired, it’s because you were performing poorly, not the colour of your skin,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/LottieLion1/status/1196186100970250247?s=20">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>Artigas <a href="https://twitter.com/JemelinArtigas/status/1196217786969837568?s=20">replied</a> to Lion’s tweet, describing her as “attention seeking”.</p>
      <p>“He did make this comment and however I did not sell this story it did happen now you will get exposed for who you are!” Artigas stated.</p>
