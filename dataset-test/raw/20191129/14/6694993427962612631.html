      <h1>Pep Guardiola reveals how relationship with Man City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak affects his future plans</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City manager has said he could stay beyond the end of his contract in 2023.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:51:11+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Brennan, https://www.facebook.com/StuBrennanMEN/?ref=hl</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has revealed how his relationship with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak plays a big factor in him wanting to stay at <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>The Blues boss this week dismissed rumours that he is preparing to leave City, and even hinted that he could seek to stay beyond the end of his current contract in 2023.</p>
      <p>And that was underlined by chairman Khaldoon, who said in midweek: “I'm very satisfied with his commitment and our commitment to him and I'm looking forward to the continuity of this for years to come.”</p>
      <p>The harmonious relationship between <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Guardiola</a> , Khaldoon, chief executive Ferran Soriano and football director <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/txiki-begirstain">Txiki Begiristain</a> is a huge lure for the Catalan coach after the wearying politics of Barcelona and the meddling of club legends at Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>And the way in which Khaldoon and the club executive team rallied behind him during a difficult, trophy-less first season in England, has reinforced the manager’s belief that he is at the right club to achieve his further ambitions.</p>
      <p>Asked whether it was encouraging to hear the comments from the chairman, Guardiola replied that it was, adding: “Especially in the bad moments of the first season.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to work in this club, especially with my chairman. We’re comfortable, talking about the club.</p>
      <p>“He’s an incredibly humble person and one of the nicest I’ve ever met.”</p>
