      <p>Jade Rowan will 'lose it' in shocking scenes to air in tonight's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, we discovered that Hope and Ruby's nanny had been hiding the mother of all secrets since she arrived in Weatherfield...</p>

      <p>As some viewers had long suspected, the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-divided-jade-is-revealed-john-stapes-daughter/">shifty childminder is actually related to Corrie killer John Stape</a> - she's his daughter.</p>
      <p>And it seems Jade has revenge on her mind, appearing to blame Fiz for her dad's death.</p>
      <aside>This episode is the one where she fully loses it - I can't wait for it to play out.</aside>
      <p>Jade will snap and lose her temper on Friday (November 29).</p>

      </p>
      <p>The single white female will be seen losing control after being told that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/jennie-mcalpine-talks-jade-rowans-shady-intentions-towards-fiz-in-coronation-street/">Fiz and Tyrone no longer need her services</a>.</p>
      <p>Screaming with rage and trashing things, Jade becomes distraught that her plans are falling apart and fans will see her snap for the first time - exposing her unhinged side.</p>
      <p>The scenes follow a dangerous fire, which Tyrone tried to blame Hope for - but fans <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-convinced-twisted-jade-started-the-fire/">think "twisted" Jade was responsible</a>.</p>

      <p>Actress Lottie Henshall, who plays Jade, told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/29/coronation-street-spoilers-john-stapes-daughter-jade-loses-kills-fiz-hope-11228233/">Metro.co.uk</a>: "You will really see her lose it tonight. We've seen her start to lose control, but this episode is the one where she fully loses it - I can't wait for it to play out.</p>
      <p>"Every single episode, we're trying to make it different. We want to confuse viewers about what her end game is."</p>
      <p>She teased: "There's so much more for her to come. There are so many episodes where she shows vulnerability. But is she being sincere or is she still lying?"</p>

      <p>She continued: "You can't trust her and she is dangerous, but there is vulnerability.</p>
      <p>"I don't know where it's going. I honestly live for getting the scripts. What's she doing this week!? I wish I could tell you!"</p>
      <p>Reports tell us that Jade's vengeance will take a disturbing turn, when she reports Fiz and Tyrone to social services.</p>
      <p>We've already seen her painting bruises on Hope's skin, but in upcoming scenes <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-fiz-and-tyrones-kids-are-taken-into-care/">Fiz and Tyrone have their children taken away from them and put into care</a>.</p>
