The Angels signed the 31-year-old Bour to a one-year, $2.5 million contract for the 2019 season, but he struggled with Los Angeles, batting .172/.259/.364 with eight home runs across 52 games.</p>
      <p>Bour’s best Major League season came in 2017, when he participated in the Home Run Derby and finished that year with 25 dingers and a 143 league-adjusted <a href="http://m.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/on-base-plus-slugging-plus">OPS+</a>.
