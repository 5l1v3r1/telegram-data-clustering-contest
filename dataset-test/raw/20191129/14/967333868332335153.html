      <p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg holds a press conference in Brussels, as the alliance is preparing to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911281077427091-nato-spending-jens-stoltenberg/">celebrate its 70th anniversary next week.</a></p>
      <p>He stated in his speech that NATO countries would discuss two principal questions at the upcoming summit – the breakup of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and relations with Moscow. According to Stoltenberg, there is no imminent threat to the alliance’s members from Russia, but <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911291077433888-moscow-accuses-nato-of-luring-extra-regional-nations-into-military-activities-in-arctic/">NATO sees Moscow as a strategic challenge.</a></p>
      <blockquote>"We will … discuss Russia and the future arms control. NATO allies have been united in response to Russia’s aggressive actions … We have agreed that our response to Russia’s breach of the INF Treaty would be defensive, measured and coordinated," he said.</blockquote>
