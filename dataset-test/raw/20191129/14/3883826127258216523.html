        <b>IT problems experienced by NatWest account holders on Friday have been resolved, the bank has said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The High Street bank said there had been a glitch affecting mobile and online transactions throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Friday was payday for some customers, and many were seeking out Black Friday offers.</p>
      <p>"All our services are now operating as normal. We apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused," a NatWest spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>The bank said debit cards, credit cards, ATMs, telephone and branch banking services had not been affected.</p>
      <p>However the inability to transfer money between accounts caused problems for some including asthmatic Tim Pitman who moved money hoping to pay for a prescription.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old singer, from Glastonbury, said he had to borrow money from a friend to pay at the chemist, which was a 15-minute drive away.</p>
      <p>He said NatWest should have been clearer with customers who were affected.</p>
      <p>Some of those customers include people hoping to get a deal during Black Friday promotions.</p>

      <p>Research from Which? released earlier this week found the banking industry suffers around five IT failures each week typically, shutting millions of customers out of accounts and making payments.</p>
