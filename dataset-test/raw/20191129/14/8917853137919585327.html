      <p><b>Mubasher:</b> BMW and its partner Great Wall Motors will establish a new joint venture (JV) in China that will produce electric vehicle (EV) models, the German auto giant said in a press release on Friday.</p>
      <p>The carmakers will invest EUR 650 million ($715.57 million) in a new plant, to produce BMW’s electric MINI brand and Great Wall Motor models, while the construction phase is planned for 2020 to 2022.</p>
      <p>The new venture, under the name of Spotlight Automotive, will have a standard capacity of up to 160,000 vehicles per annum, with a required employment of 3,000 eventually.</p>
      <p>The Chinese city of Zhangjiagang in Jiangsu Province was chosen as the new facility’s location, due to its solid supplier network, skilled workforce and developed infrastructure, BMW said.</p>
      <p>“This joint venture will enable us to produce a larger number of MINI-brand-fully electric vehicles at attractive conditions for the world market,” BMW’s management board member Nicholas Peter said.</p>
