      <p>PARIS, Nov 29 — Climate activists staged protests across Europe today to denounce the environmental toll of mass consumption, while shoppers hit the streets and the internet as retailers of all stripes touted pre-holiday bargains.</p>
      <p>The American “Black Friday” tradition of a post-Thanksgiving day of deals has taken hold in Europe as a long weekend of sales, alarming critics who say it encourages unbridled and wasteful spending.</p>
      <p>This year, activists have targeted the climate costs of frenzied shopping, in particular from delivering the millions of items ordered from Amazon and other online retailers.</p>
      <p>French NGOs had pledged a “Black Day for Amazon,” with protesters blocking a distribution centre outside Paris yesterday, and others near Lyon and Lille today.</p>
      <p>The Extinction Rebellion campaign group posted on Twitter images of protesters being forcibly removed by police from the Lyon site.</p>
      <p>“Amazon today emits as much greenhouse gases as a country,” Jean-Francois Julliard, head of Greenpeace France, said at a sit-in at Amazon’s headquarters just north of Paris today.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, young activists formed a human chain to prevent shoppers from reaching stores at the shopping mall in La Defense, the business district west of Paris.</p>
      <p>Similar human chains were formed in the central city of Saint-Etienne and town of Roanne.</p>
      <p>But many retailers across France nonetheless reported brisk Black Friday business amid drizzling rain.</p>
      <p>A salesman at the Holland Bikes store in the Villiers neighbourhood said an early rush of clients snapped up several bikes at 20 per cent off.</p>

        <b>German strike</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Germany, hundreds of Amazon workers walked off the job to escalate their long-running fight for better pay and working conditions.</p>
      <p>The strike called by the powerful Verdi union is set to last until Tuesday morning and will also cover “Cyber Monday”, another extravaganza of online discounts in what is a crucial sales period for Amazon.</p>
      <p>“Their work cannot be had at rock-bottom prices,” Verdi said in a statement, demanding a collective labour agreement to ensure “a living wage and good, healthy jobs”.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, Students for Climate called for a human chain in Maastricht.</p>
      <p>Others urged people to halt purchases altogether to protest the US-inspired event, such as the “Buy Nowt Friday” in Bradford, northern England, organised by artists and anti-poverty advocates.</p>
      <p>But many British retailers hoped deep discounts would bolster sales that have suffered from the uncertainties linked to Brexit.</p>
      <p>In Madrid, where stores across the city are offering Black Friday deals, Greenpeace held a rally just days ahead of the opening of the COP25 conference on fighting climate change.</p>
      <p>Activists unfurled a banner on the facade of a building on the Gran Via, a major shopping artery in the Spanish capital, which read “Consumerism = Climate Crisis.” — AFP</p>
