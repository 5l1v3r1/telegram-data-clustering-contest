      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Arsenal lining up €42 million move for Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:52:25+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/varun-madhav/" target="_blank">Keshav Awasty</a></address>
      <h3>Arsenal are reportedly plotting a €42 million bid to sign Real Madrid playmaker James Rodriguez in the January transfer window.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by Spanish outlet <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/177389-oferta-sorpresa-a-james-rodriguez-de-la-premier-pagan-mucho-y-lo-quieren-fuera-del-real-madrid-en-enero-ed">ElDesmarque Madrid</a>, James Rodriguez is the subject of interest from Arsenal. The Premier League heavyweights are in all sorts of trouble and are ready to shell out €42 million to secure his services in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>James Rodriguez has endured a topsy-turvy stint since joining Real Madrid from AS Monaco. A regular under Carlo Ancelotti, the Colombian playmaker suffered a dip in stature during Zinedine Zidane’s first stint at the Bernabeu before being hauled out to Bayern Munich by <i>Los Blancos</i> on loan.</p>
      <p>Following a mildly successful spell with Bayern, the player returned to Real Madrid and was immediately linked with a summer exit, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/06/18/transfer-rumour-napoli-closing-in-on-james-rodriguez-capture">with Napoli showing an interest in him</a>. But, a move failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez subsequently remained at the Bernabeu, impressing in the early stages of the season before being sidelined with injury. His exploits seem to have been duly noted, with Arsenal keen on swooping him away from Real Madrid in the January transfer window, as per the report.</p>

      <p>The Gunners are in dire straits following an abysmal start to the season. The last month or so, in particular, has been one riddled with issues, with Arsenal failing to win each of their last seven games in all competitions, a run of results that has <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/29/official-arsenal-sack-unai-emery/">ended up costing Unai Emery his job</a>.</p>
      <p>However, in the final days of Emery’s reign, one thing became clear – the attack had lost its steam and was in serious need of some refreshing. The creative options looked especially bleak, with Mesut Ozil flitting in and out of the side under Emery. Real Madrid loanee Dani Ceballos, too, fizzled out after a strong start to his loan spell with Arsenal.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how the creative midfielders perform under new management, with Fredrik Ljungberg taking charge of the first-team on interim basis for now. As things stand, though, Arsenal are in clear need of some creative boost, making James Rodriguez a viable target.</p>
      <p>ElDesmarque Madrid suggest that Arsenal are prepared to shell out €42 million to land the 28-year-old. The figure is more than what Atletico Madrid were willing to pay to sign Rodriguez before <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/07/30/transfer-news-real-madrid-pull-the-plug-on-james-rodriguezs-move-to-atletico-madrid">Real Madrid reportedly pulled the plug on a summer move</a>.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, though, wants €50 million in exchange of his services and it remains to be seen if Arsenal are ready to meet that valuation. What will also be interesting to see is if he remains a target for the Gunners once a new manager is appointed at the helm.</p>
