      <p>"We still have teams trying to qualify for the games, which covers the first four months of next year," said Tergat, while addressing the media after the General Assembly and Annual General Meeting at the Panari Hotel, Nairobi on Friday.</p>
      <p>Some of the disciplines that are yet to go through their qualification process that comes next year are boxing, women's volleyball, table tennis, judo, tae kwon-do and wrestling.</p>

      <p>Tergat confirmed that Kurume City in Fukuoka, Japan will host Team Kenya for a camp before the Games, but clarified that the local training venue after the team will gave been named, will be disclosed later.</p>
      <p>"We thought that we can't continue waiting and discussing on the venue in Japan when time was running out with other countries having already settled and selected venues," said Tergat.</p>
      <p>"We shall held consultations with specific disciplines where some would prefer to train elsewhere especially athletics that would have sprinters only in Kurume."</p>
      <p>Tergat disclosed that Team Kenya will be donning new training and competition kit that will be unveiled April next year.</p>
      <p>"We are in talks with our kit provider Nike where we are in the process of redesigning the kit," said Tergat, who was accompanied by Nock acting secretary general Francis Mutuku and treasurer Anthony Kariuki.</p>

      <p>"Nock executive is committed to reinvigorating the financial fortunes of the organisation. There has been concerted efforts to broaden the income sources of Nock which will translate to increased support to federations," said Tergat. "These efforts have started to bear fruits."</p>
