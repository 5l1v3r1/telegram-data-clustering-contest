        </li>
        <li>
          <b>8/10 WINNERS – Ran a Grade 1 race</b>

        <b>BETTRENDS SELECTION: MISTER MALARKY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Colin Tizzard has won the Ladbrokes Trophy twice in the past three years and again looks to have a live contender, in the shape of <b>MISTER MALARKY</b>, who is the right age and hails from the right end of the handicap, with the past 10 winners all being rated 146 or higher.</p>
      <p>He failed to hit the frame last time, but a mid-race error didn’t help him at Ascot, and he can be expected to strip much fitter with that run under his belt (7 of the last 10 winners had a prep during Oct/Nov). A lightly-raced, second-season chaser, the six-year-old possesses a touch of class, having won the Grade 2 Reynoldstown before finishing fourth in the Grade 1 RSA at Cheltenham, and was a 13-length course winner in January (6 of the last 10 winners were previous Newbury winners). He looks to have the right profile for the race.</p>
