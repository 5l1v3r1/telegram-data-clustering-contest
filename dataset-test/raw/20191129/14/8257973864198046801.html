      <p>Nov. 29 (UPI) -- Korean singers Jung Joon-young and Choi Jong-hoon were sentenced to several years in prison Friday after they were convicted on rape and other charges.</p>
      <p>Yonhap <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191129005200315?section=national/national">reported</a> the Seoul Central District Court sentenced Jung, 30, to six years and Choi, 30, to five years behind bars for sexually assaulting women during alcohol-fueled parties in Hongcheon, Gangwon Province three years ago,</p>
      <p>Jung's sentence was a year longer because he was also convicted of secretly filming himself having sex with women too drunk to give their consent, then sharing the videos with friends online.</p>
      <p>"The accused perpetrated sexual crimes against multiple women, degrading women and treating them as mere tools of sexual pleasure," Judge Kang Seong-soo said as he announced his verdict, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/world/asia/kpop-rape.html">according</a> to The New York Times​. "It's hard to fathom the pain the victims must have​ suffered."</p>
      <p>The men were ordered to undergo 80 hours of sexual violence treatment and are prohibited from working with children.</p>
      <p>"I deeply regret my foolishness and I feel great remorse," Jung said during his testimony. "From now on, I shall only ... live in remorse." He quit the music industry in March.</p>
      <p>Jung and Choi both insisted during the trial that the acts were consensual.</p>
