      <h1>It's the Last Day to Remember to Register That Drone You Played With Once</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:40:05+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Cutlack</a></address>
      <p>Today is the Civil Aviation Authority's deadline day for <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/uk-drone-registration-scheme/">registering all larger drones with authorities</a>, so future law enforcers can pull the remnants of a machine out of the wreckage and easily identify who it was that brought down a Dreamliner over Twickenham.</p>
      <p>It looks like an awfully large number of people are prepared to risk a £1,000 fine for not doing so, though, as current estimates say that 50,000 drone owners have registered their machines so far – leaving 80,000 of the UK's supposed 130,000 drone users outside of the official loop.</p>
      <p>If 80,000 people decide to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/how-to-get-drone-flyer-operators-licence-in-the-uk/">take their drone pilot exams</a> all at once tonight the CAA will no doubt burn though all of this quarter's data allowance and crash offline quicker than a [redacted aeroplane type from a major manufacturer], so there's bound to be quite the number of illegal drones out there in the country from tomorrow morning. [<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50595271">BBC</a>]</p>
