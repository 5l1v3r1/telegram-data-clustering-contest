      <p>Anybody can write a supportive message on Instagram to celebrate a friend’s project.</p>
      <p>But if you want to be unique, you’ve got to think outside the box.</p>
      <p>Which leads us on to Daisy Lowe, who has posed topless to mark the release of her rumoured boyfriend Jack Peñate’s new album.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old model shared a picture of her topless torso in an effort to show off her nail art – which featured the album artwork for Peñate’s new record After You.</p>

      <p>The former Strictly Come Dancing star captioned the Instagram post: ‘ITS OUT!!! AFTER YOU is an absolute masterpiece. It took a decade and it was well worth the wait!! Full of all the love, wisdom &amp; ecstasy that makes up you @jackpenate it’s a real treat for the ears.</p>

      <p>‘Stream it, download it, share it &amp; enjoy if you know what’s good for you! I love it so much I got the cover tattooed on my nails… by @anouskaanastasia @nuka.nails original artwork by @eddie_peake &amp; all made possible by @rosie_skinner.’</p>
      <p>Daisy’s coral nails, with an ombre blue pyramid on her middle fingers, were quite beautiful, but we rather doubt they’ll be the focus of the picture for most.</p>
      <p>The star also uploaded a picture of the actual artwork and a snap of Jack, 35, performing on stage.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Jack, best known for his top 10 hit Torn On The Platform, shared his own emotional Instagram post about the release of his third album – his first in a decade.</p>
      <p>He wrote: ‘Can’t believe it’s here. So many years of joy, pain and love poured into this object.</p>
      <p>‘It’s incredible it’s taken a decade to arrive but now it’s in my hands all the time melts away and all I’m left with is pride.</p>
      <p>‘There’s too much to say for now other than to thank my family, friends, management, labels and all those people who listen to my music and have brought me back to what brings me more happiness than you can imagine.’</p>
