      <p>What is the Echo Flex you might ask? Basically, it's a plug-and-play <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-which-should-you-buy">Echo</a> that is intended for those spaces where a traditional Echo or smart speaker either doesn't fit or doesn't quite make sense. You can plug an Echo Flex into any standard wall outlet and have instand access to Alexa for whatever purpose you might need, be that asking about the weather or controlling your smart lights.</p>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R5CJDD7?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUtUinlineadYYw">The Google Pixel 3a XL is the phone to buy on Black Friday!</a>
        <br/>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J42JMQ2?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUtUinlineadYYw">This Black Friday Lightning Deal will save you $97 on this Chromebook</a>
      </p>
      <p>There are also third-party accessories you can get to enhance your Echo Flex even further, including a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Made-Amazon-THIRDREALITY-Motion-Sensor/dp/B07VF43BG1/ref=sr_1_3?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU83106YYw">motion sensor</a> (to trigger home automations?) and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Made-Amazon-THIRDREALITY-Smart-Night-Light/dp/B07VDPY2RL/ref=sr_1_4?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU83106YYw">nightlight</a> (for those darker spaces).</p>
      <p>The Echo Flex itself has a tiny speaker so you can hear replies from Alexa and maybe the news report, but it's not ideal for listening to music. While it does take up one of your outlet spaces, it has a USB charging port at the bottom so that you can still do passthrough charging of small accessories like your smartphone.</p>
      <p>We think this little Echo will sell like hotcakes this holiday season, and we encourage you to pick up a few for your friends and family. Oh, and its size means it will fit perfectly into your family's stockings as the ultimate stocking stuffer!</p>
