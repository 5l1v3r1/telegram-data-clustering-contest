      <h1>No, The Simpsons Is NOT Ending, Says Producer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:11:04+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arvedon</a></address>
      <p>It appears the claim that the hit animated series <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-simpsons/">The Simpsons</a></i> is coming to an end was a bit premature.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-simpsons-is-ending-claims-danny-elfman/">composer Danny Elfman</a> said the three-decade-old series was nearing its conclusion, executive producer Al Jean stepped in to reassure fans that's not the case.</p>

      <p>"From what I’ve heard, it’s coming to an end," Elfman claimed, causing an immediate rift among fans of Springfield's first family. "I don’t know for a fact, but I’ve heard that it will be in its last year."</p>
      <p><i>The Simpsons</i> was recently renewed for its <a href="https://www.cbr.com/fox-simpsons-renewed/">31st and 32nd seasons</a>, and after Disney's acquisition of Fox, nearly every past episode of the series found a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-simpsons-are-heading-to-disney/">new home on Disney+</a>. What's more, at D23 Expo in August, Jean teased the possibility of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/simpsons-producers-movie-spinoff-talks-disney/">more films and even potential spinoffs</a>.</p>
