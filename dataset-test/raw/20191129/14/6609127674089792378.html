      <p>Now, her loved ones are planning a lantern and balloon vigil in her memory.</p>
      <p>The release is set to take place at Belsyde Park in Drumchapel at 7pm on Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>Close friend Allyson Burrell, who has organised the vigil, said: "That's where we spend most of our days when we were growing up.</p>
      <p>"Would be lovely if everyone who loved her could make it along."</p>
      <p>Stacy's friends and family have vowed to make it a "beautiful night" for the tragic mum.</p>
      <p>And they've asked heading along to make sure balloons or lanterns being released are environmentally friendly and biodegradable as Stacy "would have preferred that".</p>

        <figcaption>Tragic Stacy has been described as 'beautiful inside and out'</figcaption>

      <p>One said: "To think this is where all our childhood memories are.</p>
      <p>"Breaks my heart that this will be the reason everyone will be getting together again but she deserves a beautiful night."</p>
      <p>We told earlier how Stacy's heartbroken dad led tributes to his beautiful daughter after the childbirth tragedy.</p>
      <p>Distraught John Joyce said: "Our world has come crashing down like we as a whole family could never imagine.</p>
      <p>"Stacey Louise Joyce was sadly taken from us while giving birth to a perfect wee, over eight pounds, healthy baby boy.</p>
      <p>"We promise you one thing, Stacy, that wee stunner will be looked after like you'll never know.</p>
      <p>"Fly high my princess. Love you more than you'll ever know."</p>
