      <p>A convicted robber choked a talented student after she ignored his cat calls, then sexually assaulted his victim’s lifeless body, police say.</p>
      <p>Donald Thurman, 26, allegedly tried chatting to Ruth George, 19, as she walked past a CTA Blue Line station near the University of Illinois at Chicago campus early Saturday.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said that George ignored Thurman’s overtures, prompting him to follow her into a deserted parking garage at 1:25am.</p>
      <p>He is then said to have put the honor roll student into a chokehold until she passed out, before dragging her onto the back seat of her Kia.</p>
      <p>Once there, Thurman is said to have sexually assaulted George and left her face-down in the car seat.</p>

      <p>Her death was ruled a homicide by strangulation.</p>
      <p>A condom containing Thurman’s DNA was found at the scene, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>Investigators also found his hand print on George’s Kia, and her white jacket at his home, the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2019/11/26/20984029/bail-denied-donald-thurman-ruth-george-uic-garage">Chicago Sun-Times</a> reported.</p>
      <p>They are further said to have uncovered clear surveillance camera footage of him entering the garage around the time George was killed.</p>

      <p>Thurman was released from jail last December after serving two years of a six year sentence for armed robbery.</p>
      <p>He now faces first-degree murder and sexual assault charges over George’s death.</p>
      <p>The devastated student’s family paid a glowing tribute to her, saying: ‘Ruth lived out her deep faith in Jesus by loving and serving others, leaving a legacy of Christ-centered kindness and sacrifice.</p>
      <p>‘She was the beloved baby of our family. We grieve with hope.</p>
      <p>‘We hold no hatred towards the perpetrator, but our hope is no other girl would be harmed in this way and for a mother to never experience this type of heartache.’</p>
      <p>Thurman had a bail hearing Tuesday, and was ordered held in jail until his next court appearance December 16.</p>
