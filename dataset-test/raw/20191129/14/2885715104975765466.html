      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:00:14+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>India’s G Sathiyan won both his group matches against higher-ranked opponents to enter the round of 16 in the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Men’s World Cup here on Friday.</p>
      <p>The world number 30 Sathiyan, making his World Cup debut, defeated Frenchman Simon Gauzy, ranked eight places above him, 4-3 in a thrilling and energy-sapping first match that lasted one hour and four minutes before a 4-2 win over world number 24 Groth Jonathan of Denmark.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Indian topped the group D standings with four points to book a pre-quarterfinal berth. He will now face former world number one and current number eight Timo Boll of Germany in the round of 16 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In his first match of the day against Gauzy, Sathiyan was down two games but made an impressive recovery to win the match 11-13, 9-11, 11-8, 14-12, 7-11, 11-5, 11-8.</p>
      <p>Gauzy looked like he was in control early on but the consistent backhand block and return shots from Sathiyan turned the match on its head.</p>
      <p>“I am just out of words, this is a fantastic win for me. This is the first time I am beating Gauzy after losing two very close matches. I was match point up in the World Team Championships and I lost. This was getting into my head, not again,” Sathiyan said after the hard-fought win.</p>
      <p>“My coach kept motivating me and I just kept believing. Losing the first game after being 10-6 up, I was a little upset that I could not capitalise on it. You can never take it easy against Gauzy. He is always coming back at you but I was ready for it this time and really happy that I was successful.”</p>
      <p>Against Jonathan, the top Indian paddler dominated the match and scored an 11-3, 12-10, 7-11, 16-14, 8-11, 11-8 win.</p>
      <p>Gauzy advanced to the round of 16 as Group D runner-up with three points from two matches.</p>
      <p>He beat Jonathan 4-1 (11-9, 7-11, 11-5, 11-6, 11-2) in his second group match.</p>
