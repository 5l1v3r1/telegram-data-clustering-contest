      <p>Ghanaian actress and movie producer, Yvonne Nelson has sent an interesting birthday message to Ghana’s ex-president, John Dramani Mahama as he celebrates his 61st birthday today.</p>
      <p>It seems her message has come as a shock to Ghanaians as she has for long been a critic of the former head of state.</p>
      <p>According to Yvonne who has always criticised John Mahama of his bad governance, there were some particular things the ex-president did that she really liked.</p>
      <p>In a post on twitter, the Heels and Sneakers actress praised John Mahama thanking God for keeping him and also thanking the ex-president for his developmental projects such as New terminal and the Ridge Hospital.</p>
      <p><i><b>“Happy birthday you impressed me with our new terminal and the ridge hospital good job! #development is what Gh needs!”</b></i> she wrote.</p>
