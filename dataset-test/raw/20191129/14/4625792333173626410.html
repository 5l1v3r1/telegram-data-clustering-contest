      <h1>‘Sources of funding’: Ronan Farrow says Hillary Clinton cooled on him when he investigated #MeToo crimes</h1>

      <p>Journalist Ronan Farrow said Hillary Clinton tried to distance herself from him when she discovered he was investigating sexual assault allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.</p>
      <p>“It’s remarkable how quickly even people with a long relationship with you will turn if you threaten the centres of power or the sources of funding around them,” Farrow <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/07ad38ee-1046-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae">told the <i>Financial Times</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, there are a lot of people out there who operate in that way. They’re beholden to powerful interests and if you go up against those interests, you become radioactive very quickly,” he said.</p>
      <p>Clinton appointed Farrow as her special adviser on global youth issues in 2011 when she was secretary of state. Farrow said he had worked with Clinton “for years” when he was looking into the Weinstein story.</p>
      <p>Weinstein donated tens of thousands of dollars to groups supporting Clinton’s candidacy during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=harvey+weinstein">Federal Election Committee data</a>.</p>
      <p>After Farrow reported on numerous allegations against Weinstein, who is now facing charges, Clinton said she was “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hillary-clinton-shocked-and-appalled-by-harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-allegations">shocked and appalled</a>.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, Farrow said Clinton’s aides tried to back out of an interview with him after they learned it would be about Weinstein’s behavior.</p>
      <p>"Hillary Clinton had scheduled an interview while it was at the height of the Weinstein reporting and her folks got in touch and said, 'We hear you're working on a big story,'" Farrow <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hillary-clinton-wanted-to-cancel-interview-after-learning-it-was-about-harvey-weinstein-ronan-farrow">said</a>. "[They] sounded very concerned and tried to cancel that interview."</p>
