      <h1>Financial boost for minority media</h1>

      <p>Newspapers run by members of the Armenian, Greek and Jewish communities are to receive extra state funds thanks to an affirmative action scheme.<br/><br/>The Press Advertising Authority (BİK) has decided to raise the funding offered to such outlets by 25%, or to the tune of around TL 250,000. The decision covers only minorities recognized under the Treaty of Lausanne, which defined the status of Turkey's shrinking minorities 95 years ago.<br/><br/>The yearly financial support requires newspapers to be at least three years old and publishing either in Turkish or in the language of the community they cater to on a daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly basis.<br/><br/>The BİK has allocated funds amounting to more than TL 1.4 million to minority newspapers since 2011.<br/><br/>The newspapers, many of whom have only limited circulation, were once barred from publishing commercials as part of the state-run press, driving many into a financial bottleneck having relied on these for revenue. A 2012 regulation paved the way for them to publish commercials, but they still struggle, making government cash assistance necessary.</p>
