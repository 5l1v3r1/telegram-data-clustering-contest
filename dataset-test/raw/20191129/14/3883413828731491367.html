      <p>The Red Arrows has welcomed three new pilots to the team ahead of the 2020 display season.</p>
      <p>Flight Lieutenant Will Cambridge, Flight Lieutenant Nick Critchell and Flight Lieutenant James Turner will spend the next three years with the aerobatic team.</p>
      <p>They arrive with a wealth of experience in the Royal Air Force behind them, having all previously flown Typhoon aircraft operationally.</p>

      <p>Flight Lieutenant Cambridge, who will fly as Red 2 in 2020, said: "It is a huge privilege to be selected for the Red Arrows.</p>
      <p>"The Red Arrows are an iconic team and being part of it, even for only a short, three-year period, will be the highlight of my flying career."</p>
      <p>Flight Lieutenant Critchell described it as a "real honour", while Flight Lieutenant Turner said he was "very excited".</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Flight Lieutenant David Simmonds has returned to the team as Red 5 after <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/change-top-after-red-arrows-pilot-injured-playing-football">a football injury forced him out of last year's display season</a>.</p>

      <p>The team is now training for the 2020 season at the Red Arrows' home base of RAF Scampton.</p>
      <p>Pilots are flying three times a day, starting with small formations of only a few aircraft before gradually building up to the trademark, full nine-ship formation.</p>
      <p>In around April, the team will move overseas for a period of focused training in a location with more settled weather.</p>
