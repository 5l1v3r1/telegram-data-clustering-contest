      <h1>Newsweek Jumps the Gun on What Trump Was Doing For Thanksgiving — Gets Egg on Its Face</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:40:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/juliorosas" target="_blank">Julio Rosas</a></address>
      <p>Newsweek ran a story asserting the commander-in-chief was spending the Thanksgiving holiday "tweeting, golfing and more" before it was revealed President Trump <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bronsonstocking/2019/11/28/trump-surprises-troops-if-afghanistan-on-thanksgiving-day-n2557225">made an unannounced visit</a> to U.S. military members in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>In a since <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-thanksgiving-plans-maralago-1474518">corrected story</a>, Newsweek's headline now reads, "HOW DID TRUMP SPEND THANKSGIVING? TWEETING, GOLFING—AND SURPRISING U.S. TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN" and has the following editor's note: "This story has been substantially updated and edited at 6:17 pm EST to reflect the president's surprise trip to Afghanistan."</p>
      <p>The author of the article deleted her tweet and sent a correction, saying "it was written before knowing about the president’s surprise visit to Afghanistan-an honest mistake."</p>

      <p>The story was widely mocked and skewered on social media. Trump even tweeted, "I thought Newsweek was out of business?"</p>

      <p>During his visit, Trump met with Afghanistan President Ashrav Ghani, served Thanksgiving meals to troops, took pictures, and gave a speech to those gathered at Bagram Air Force Base.</p>
      <p>"There’s nowhere I’d rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here with the toughest, strongest, best, and bravest warriors on the face of the Earth," Trump said.</p>
