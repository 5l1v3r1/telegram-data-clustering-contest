      <h1>Man City's acquisition of Mumbai ISL team good for India: Amrinder Singh</h1>
      <h2>English Premier League champions Manchester City's parent company City Football Group on Thursday bought a majority 65 percent stake in Indian Super League (ISL) franchise Mumbai City FC</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:05:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Mumbai City goalkeeper Amrinder Singh has described City Football Group's acquisition of his club as "momentous", saying it will provide a massive boost to the sport in the country.</p>
      <p>English Premier League champions Manchester City's parent company City Football Group on Thursday bought a majority 65 percent stake in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-super-league">Indian Super League </a>(ISL) franchise <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mumbai-city-fc">Mumbai City FC.</a></p>
      <p>This is the first time a top European club has acquired a majority stake of a club in India, and the development is also expected to bring its renowned manager, Pep Guardiola, closer to the country.</p>
      <p>"I feel this is a momentous deal. This is indeed a great moment for football in India and all the young players who are emerging to play the sport," Amrinder said.</p>
      <p>"We have seen in the last four or five years how rapid the progress has been in Indian football after the emergence of the ISL. I believe City Football Group coming to India can only take football forward in our country."<br/><br/>With this deal, Mumbai City joined an elite list of clubs who are under the ownership of the Abu Dhabi based CFG which includes Premier League champions <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/manchester-city">Manchester City </a>and six other clubs around the world.</p>
      <p>All of CFG's clubs have achieved remarkable branding and have seen booming business off the field.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/manchester-city">Manchester City </a>have improved leaps and bounds to be recognized as one of the best teams in the world under Guardiola and Mumbai City will hope to achieve a step up in terms of quality, with a global reach for the club already guaranteed.</p>
      <p>There could be a possibility of Mumbai City players also being part of an exchange programme which would allow them to train at some of the CFG-owned clubs across the world and thus, improve their skills further.</p>
      <p>Coach Jorge Costa, who won the UEFA Champions League with FC Porto as a player, believes that with CFG coming on board at Mumbai City, good times are around the corner for football fans in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>"I am very proud to be part of this. I am very happy and excited. This will be wonderful for Mumbai City and also for ISL. I think they can bring us a lot of expertise to help the club first and then the ISL," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think we still have a lot of work to do to improve the quality of ISL. Comparing to last year we are improving. It is a gradual process," said the Portuguese coach.</p>
