      <p>He said that he never thought that his leaving the PDP for the APC would generate a lot of controversies as it was now n the State just as he added that he has been preventing a mass defection of members of his former party to the ruling party in the state.</p>

      <p>Ize-Iyamu said his coming into the APC, was not to pitch tent with any faction but to foster develop and strengthen the party in the state.</p>
      <p>“I am joining APC with an open mind. I am not going to look at my contributions to it before I left though people might want to refer to them. I am not concerned about that, my concern for them now is how to ensure that APC is strengthened and development gets to the people at the grassroots”, he said.</p>
      <p>He explained that he left the APC then with anger and that time has been able to heal his wound.</p>
