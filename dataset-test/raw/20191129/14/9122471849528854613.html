      <h1>Video: Ole Miss Player’s Dog Pee TD Celebration Costs Rebels Egg Bowl</h1>

      <p>While the rest of America was busy going back for seconds of Thanksgiving Dinner, the Ole Miss Rebels and Mississippi State Bulldogs were battling it out in the Egg Bowl.</p>
      <p>The two struggling teams managed to provide one of the most entertaining Thanksgiving Day games in recent memory.</p>
      <p>Trailing 21-14 with just two minutes left in the game, Ole Miss put together a remarkable drive – including converting on a fourth and 24 – to score what looked like would be the game-tying touchdown.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Matt Corral, who replaced starter John Rhys Plumlee, threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Elijah Moore with just four seconds left on the clock.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Moore’s touchdown celebration resulted in a 15-yard penalty. He mimicked a dog peeing on the Mississippi State field.</p>
      <p>Here’s the play.</p>

      <p>Officials flagged Moore on the play for unsportsmanlike conduct, which backed kicker Luke Logan back to the 18-yard line.</p>
      <p>On the ensuing extra point, Logan missed.</p>
      <p>The Rebels attempted an unsuccessful onside kick and the game was over. With the loss, Ole Miss finished the season with a 4-8 record.</p>
      <p>Mississippi State, meanwhile, became bowl eligible after moving to 6-6 with the win.</p>
      <p>Moore will definitely get an earful from his coaches when the film comes on next week.</p>
