      <p>Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Manish Bhatt issued the summons under section 318 of Negotiable Instruments Act.</p>
      <p>“The JMFC directed the actor to remain present before it on January 27,” petitioner Nisha Chhipa’s counsel, Durgesh Sharma quoted.</p>
      <p>It is being said that Ameesha borrowed 10 lakhs for producing a film.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, last month, Ranchi court issued an arrest warrant against Ameesha in a cheating and cheque bounce case, police said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Ameesha Patel and her business partner Kunal had taken Rs 2.50 crore for making a film. They had assured to return the money after the release of the film in 2018. The film never released in 2018. When we approached Ameesha Patel for the money, she gave a cheque of Rs 3 crore, which bounced,” said Ajay Singh in a press statement.</p>
