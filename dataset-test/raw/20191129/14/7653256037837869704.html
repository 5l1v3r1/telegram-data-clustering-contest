      <p>NEW DELHI: Former prime minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Manmohan-Singh">Manmohan Singh</a> said on Friday the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/GDP">GDP</a> growth rate of 4.5 per cent was unacceptable and worrisome, and urged his successor <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi">Narendra Modi</a> to set aside "deep-rooted suspicion" of society and nurse India back to harmonious, mutually trustworthy society that can help the economy soar.</p>
      <p>Delivering his valedictory address at a national conclave on economy, Singh said mutual trust is the bedrock of societal transactions fostering <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/economic-growth">economic growth</a>, but "our social fabric of trust, confidence is now torn and ruptured".</p>
      <p>He said the "toxic combination of deep distrust, pervasive fear and a sense of hopelessness in our society" is stifling economic activity and growth.</p>
