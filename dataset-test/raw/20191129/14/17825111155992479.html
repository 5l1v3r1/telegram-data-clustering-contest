      <p>Johannesburg - Gauteng police arrested 600 suspects wanted for various crimes including murder, hijacking, rape, assault and robberies, during an Operation O Kae Molao sting. </p>
      <p>The operation took place on Wednesday night and during the early hours of Thursday morning at different locations around the province. </p>
      <p>Police officers were accompanied by Gauteng’s provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela, and head of department for Gauteng Community Safety, Yoliswa Makhasi. </p>
      <p>Gauteng police said six minibus taxis had been impounded for having suspected stolen engines.</p>
      <p>Gauteng police spokesperson, Captain Mavela Masondo, said some vehicles were caught with drugs and large volumes of dagga during the roadblocks.  </p>
      <p>He said in another arrest, police officers were offered a R10 000 bribe.</p>
      <p>“A R10 000 bribe could not stop the police from arresting six suspects who were found in possession of an estimate of 80 kilograms of copper. Police stopped a suspicious Mitsubishi double cab bakkie and upon searching the vehicle, they found straps of copper hidden underneath the ‘recycled cans’,” he said.</p>
      <p>Police said they fined three car dealerships R7500 for non-compliance with the Second Hand Goods Act after several cars’ computer boxes were found to be allegedly tampered with.</p>
      <p>“Police continued with the raiding of second-hand goods dealerships with an intention of recovering illicit goods as well as stolen and hijacked vehicles. </p>
      <p>“This raid once more yielded positive results as several vehicle computer boxes and cars that are tempered with were seized for further investigation. Three dealers were fined a total of R7500 for non-compliance with the Second Hand Goods Act,” said Masondo. </p>
      <p>Masondo said in an operation to the south of Joburg, R10m worth of illegal gambling equipment and counterfeit goods were recovered.</p>
      <p>Mawela has since urged the public to be careful when buying second hand goods, especially vehicles. </p>
      <p>“If possible the buyers can avail the vehicle for inspection to the police before any transaction is made,” he said. </p>
