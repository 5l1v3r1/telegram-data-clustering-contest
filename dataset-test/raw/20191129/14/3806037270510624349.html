      <h1>Supreme Fukuoka New Location Announced</h1>
      <h2>Remaining in the trendy Daimyo shopping area.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:57:18+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Eng</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.hypebeast.com/tags/supreme">Supreme</a> has announced the location and grand re-opening of its Fukuoka location, in the southern island of Kyushu, Japan.</p>
      <p>The retail space, still located in the Daimyo shopping neighborhood, is a one-story boutique that follows similarly to the brand’s aesthetic found across Japan: minimalistic layouts that utilize hardwood floors, steel fixtures, and industrial design elements. Art is seen with <a href="https://www.hypebeast.com/tags/mark-gonzales">Mark Gonzales</a> statues — Osaka and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2012/9/supreme-shibuya-store-opening-recap">Shibuya</a> both contain original Gonz sculptures — and collage wallpapers pulled from Supreme’s archive of historic behind-the-scenes photographs of its skaters and cohorts. Floor-to-ceiling glass and gallery lighting create an airy atmosphere that promotes a casual shopping experience.</p>
      <p>Supreme’s original location — just a few meters away at Daimyo 1-11-29 — opened in 1998 and found the store nestled beneath a karaoke parlor within the vicinity of trending shops and small restaurants. The Daimyo area however is quite synonymous with up and coming trends in fashion and style, along with catering to the best in Japanese and import labels; <a href="https://www.hypebeast.com/tags/bape">A Bathing Ape</a>, <a href="https://www.hypebeast.com/tags/neighborhood">NEIGHBORHOOD</a>, Nike and Dr. Martens are all within a stone’s throw away.</p>
