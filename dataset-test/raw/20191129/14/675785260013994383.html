      <h2>The former Gunners boss was axed on Friday following the club's worst run of form since 1992, but Mourinho has sent a message of support to the Spaniard after hearing the news</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:13:56+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> has issued a message to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> following his sacking as Arsenal manager.</p>
      <p>Emery was removed from his post on Friday after board member determined over a crunch meeting it was time for a change.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> legend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fredrik-ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> has taken over as interim Gunners boss with immediate effect, and has been tasked with turning round the club's fortunes after Emery oversaw the club's worst run since 1992.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho was quick to reassure his fellow manager that he will bounce back and make a return to football.</p>
      <p>"No dramas, mi amigo," Mourinho said. "Keep going and you will get another club."</p>

      <p>Mourinho has only been in charge at Arsenal's north London rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> less than a fortnight, having replaced Mauricio Pochettino last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>When asked whether he would have considered the Arsenal post, Mourinho said: "I'm so happy here that I couldn't even think about the possibility to go to another place.</p>
      <p>"You can put now in front of me any club in the world, I would not move."</p>

      <p>Pochettino has now been sensationally linked with a switch to the Emirates after his five-year spell with the club ended.</p>
      <p>He is priced at odds of 25/1 to take permanent charge, while Ljungberg remains joint favourite with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> boss Nuno Espirito Santo at 6/4.</p>
      <p>The final straw for Emery came as Arsenal fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Fans held up 'Emery Out' banners in protest to the manager, who lasted just 18 months in charge.</p>
      <p>Arsenal released a statement announcing his sacking less than 12 hours after the defeat.</p>
      <p>It read: "Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand. We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success.‚Äù</p>
