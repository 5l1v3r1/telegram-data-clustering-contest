      <p>NEW YORK -- Brad Paisley is perfectly comfortable being the butt of jokes. In his new variety special, "Brad Paisley Thinks He's Special," airing Dec. 3 on ABC, the country star allows himself to be the punchline in a number of skits with celeb pals including Peyton Manning, Carrie Underwood, the Jonas Brothers and Tim McGraw.</p>
      <p>"It's the way I got everybody to do it. I said, 'You're here to roast me,"' he says. "When we were talking on the phone I said, 'Guys, no misconception here. You need to realize this exists for me to be laughed at and I'm good with that.' So they were like, 'We're in."'</p>
      <p>In one highlight, Underwood takes Paisley mudding in a red truck yelling, "I feel the need for speed" with Paisley exclaiming, "Jesus take the wheel!" as he tries to hold on.</p>
      <p>"There's a side of Carrie I've never seen before doing this," said Paisley.</p>
      <p>The award-winning musician has enjoyed showing his comedic side since high school and as his star rose in showbiz, it caught on that he was always game to play. He's co-hosted the CMA's 11 times, had a comedy special on Netflix and stars in a series of Nationwide insurance commercials with Manning.</p>
      <p>"You show up on some of these late-night shows like `Kimmel,' they've figured out a long time ago that I'm up for anything and so they'll frequently have me guest and do a funny song or a skit or a thing. Same with other friends I've made. Seth Meyers is a good friend and people like that that over the years I really enjoy the collaborative process of doing things outside of my comfort zone."</p>
      <p>Implementing ideas and turning them into a reality is a thrill for the 47-year-old.</p>
      <p>"I love nothing more than creating and sort of coming up with an idea and seeing it through in this career. Whether that's a song that you write, and it becomes a single and a hit and a video and a thing you do on tour and leads to everything else or it's a television show. There's nothing more satisfying than saying here's the finish line and I think if we do all these things right, we can get there."</p>
