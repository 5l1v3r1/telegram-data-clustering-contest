      <p>This weekend of college football is loaded with tons of rivalry games, including a showdown between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn Tigers.</p>
      <p>It’s arguably the best rivalry game in college football and this weekend’s clash has College Football Playoff implications on the line. Auburn is looking to play spoiler to its bitter rival as Alabama looks to keep its playoff streak alive.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide desperately need a win if they want to stay alive in the playoff race after their loss to LSU three weeks ago. Alabama won’t have a conference title in hand and the loss of star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa looms large.</p>
      <p>However, if backup quarterback Mac Jones and the Tide roll to an impressive victory on Saturday, Nick Saban’s squad could make a case for the playoff.</p>
      <p>Here are the details for the Alabama-Auburn game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>3:30 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel:</b> CBS</p>
      <p><b>Spread: </b>Alabama -3</p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>49</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Brad Nessler, Gary Danielson, Jamie Erdahl</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s Football Power Index, the Crimson Tide have a 65.6-percent chance of defeating the Tigers on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Alabama opened as a 3.5-point favorite, but it’s clear bettors have faith in Auburn this weekend. Can the Tigers pull off the upset and ruin Alabama’s chance at a playoff run?</p>
