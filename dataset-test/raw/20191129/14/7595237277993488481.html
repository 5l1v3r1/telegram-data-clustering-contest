      <h1>Summary review of cervical test results due next week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:56:47+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.rte.ie/author/822895-fergal-bowers/%20" target="_blank">Fergal Bowers, https://www.facebook.com/rtenews/</a></address>
      <p>The summary report of the review of over 1,000 CervicalCheck smear test results, by an expert panel from the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists (RCOG), is expected to be published next week.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Minister for Health Simon Harris said that he has not yet received the report and is not due to be given it today.</p>
      <p>However, it is understood the report should be received in time for a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday and be published afterwards.</p>
      <p>The expert panel was tasked with determining, wherever possible, cases where there were any failures to prevent cancer, or to intervene at an earlier stage.</p>
      <p>It has informed the 1,050 women who participated in the review of cases where there was a failure to identify abnormal cells and if this represented a missed opportunity to diagnose cancers at an earlier stage.</p>
      <p>Where errors were identified by the review, it may not have been possible to say conclusively that they resulted in a poorer outcome for the individual woman.</p>
      <p>It has also informed women of cases where the RCOG review of the slide review is in agreement with the original CervicalCheck result.</p>
      <p>The individual reports produced for each woman do not determine whether a failure to detect underlying abnormal cells, when her smear test was being examined, was negligent, in a legal sense.</p>
      <p>At a recent Oireachtas Health Committee meeting, the Health Service Executive indicated that it expected the percentage of cases where the review found a different result - what is termed a discordant rate - to be substantially less than 40%, which would be the upper end.</p>
      <p>All of the individual reports received from the RCOG were subject to a verification exercise by the HSE to ensure the details were correct.</p>
      <p>Queries which required clarification were reverted to the UK team by the HSE, according to the most recent CervicalCheck Steering Group minutes.</p>
      <p>It was agreed that the RCOG summary report would be released to the minister, after all of the women who took part had received the results of their individual reviews.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>In the wake of the CervicalCheck crisis, in May of last year,  Minister Harris commissioned the expert panel to review smear histories.</p>
      <p>This was offered to each woman who had developed cervical cancer, having taken part in the CervicalCheck screening programme since it was set up in 2008.</p>
      <p>The RCOG review was assisted by the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.</p>
      <p>The reviewers were aware that all of the women went on to develop cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>But when doing their fresh review, they were not aware of the CervicalCheck result at the time the original smear was reviewed.</p>
