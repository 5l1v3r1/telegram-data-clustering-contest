      <p>President of the Arab Parliament Dr. Mishaal bin Fahm Al-Salami rejected the European Parliament's resolution on the situation of human rights and freedoms in Algeria, issued on Thursday, considering the European Parliament has no legal jurisdiction over Algeria.<br/><br/>He said in a statement that the resolution is a blatant and unacceptable interference in the sovereignty and internal affairs of Algeria, pointing out that the resolution contradicts the principles of the United Nations on non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the Declaration of Principles of International Law.<br/><br/>He stressed that Algeria is keen to implement its obligations under international and regional human rights conventions and is committed to submit periodic reports on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms to the UN Human Rights Council and to the Arab League Human Rights Committee (Charter Committee).<br/><br/>Dr. Al-Salami called on the European Parliament to respect the sovereignty of Algeria and its rules of criminal justice, not to interfere in its internal affairs, and to adopt a constructive approach that encourages interaction and dialogue between the European Parliament and Arab parliaments, the Saudi Press Agency reported.</p>
