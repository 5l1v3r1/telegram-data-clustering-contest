      <p>A man has been shot by police near London Bridge after several people were stabbed in an incident which is being treated as "terror-related", the Metropolitan Police said.</p>
      <p>Footage on social media appeared to show members of the public grappling with the knifeman before being pulled away by armed officers, one of whom shot the suspect at point-blank range.</p>
      <p>A bystander appeared to remove a large knife from the scene.</p>
      <p>A Scotland Yard statement said: "A number of people have been stabbed."</p>
      <p>They added: "However, as a precaution, we are currently responding to this incident as though it is <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/in-the-news">terror-related.</a></p>
      <p>"One man has been shot by police."</p>

      <p>BBC journalist John McManus said a group of men were involved in a fight on the bridge, police arrived and then he claims shots were fired.</p>
      <p>"Police then quickly arrived, including armed police, and then a number of shots were fired at this man," Mr McManus told BBC News.</p>
      <p>"Police have now cleared the bridge, everybody has been told to move back and now on the northern side of the bridge, but there are more shots going on.</p>
      <p>"I can't see what's happening now because we've been moved out of the way but there are shots going on, and you probably hear the police sounds as well.</p>
      <p>"Everybody has cleared the area, the entire bridge has been moved, and right on the northern part of the bridge, right up until quite near the Bank of England, is being cleared."</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "I'm being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response."</p>
      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel wrote on Twitter: "Very concerned by ongoing incident at London Bridge. My thoughts are with all affected. I am grateful for the rapid response of our police and I urge everyone to follow their advice."</p>
      <p>Various social media users have reported hearing gunshots from London Bridge.</p>
      <p>One video shows what appears to be police pulling equipment out of a vehicle nearby.</p>
      <p>Those in the video can be heard saying: "They've actually got guns out. They've got the guns out."</p>
      <p>Nurse Jackie Bensfield, 32, described how she asked to be let off a bus on London Bridge after she heard "five or six" gunshots.</p>
      <p>Ms Bensfield, who was on her way home from work, said she exited the bus and "ran like hell" to escape the shots.</p>
      <p>Connor Allen, who was in his van on the bridge when it was evacuated said: "Everyone just started running, you heard these pops and that was it. We just got out the van and started running."</p>
      <p>One business owner told the PA news agency she had been crossing London Bridge to get to her shop on the north side when police officers stopped her.</p>
      <p>She said that was when she heard at least five or six gunshots and said that her store has been evacuated.</p>
      <p>The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "We heard shooting, it was about five or six shots, I heard five or six quite clearly.</p>
      <p>"All my staff have been evacuated."</p>
