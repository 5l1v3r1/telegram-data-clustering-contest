      <p>Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi has stated clearly that himself and the rest of his teammates are to be blamed for the sacking of manager Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was dismissed on Friday afternoon, November 29, after poor form of run this season by Arsenal in all competitions which brings an end to his 18-month reign.</p>
      <p>Last season after Unai Emery replaced Arsene Wenger, he steered the Gunners to the final of the Europa League where they lost against Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Gunners' fans were expecting their players to start the current Premier League season in fine form, but the North London club failed to get their rhythm under Emery.</p>

      <p>Arsenal's 2-1 defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League ended the reign of Unai Emery at the Emirates stadium.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We’re not winning games. We often have more of the game but we don’t reward ourselves enough for that. Opponents punish us for that.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“We have to try to convert our chances in those key moments and deny the opponents chances earlier, before the ball hits the back of the net,''</i> Shkodran Mustafi explained according to Daily Star UK.</p>
      <p>Also, goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez blamed himself and teammates for Unai Emery's sacking at the Emirates stadium claiming that the players let him down.</p>
      <p>Martinez wrote on Twitter: <i>'Thank you Unai Emery and Javi [Garcia]. I'm sorry we let you down, it's our fault for not performing the right way, I'm sure we will meet again.'</i></p>
