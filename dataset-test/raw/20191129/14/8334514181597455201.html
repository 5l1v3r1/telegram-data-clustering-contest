      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Foreign Ministry will summon Turkey’s ambassador following insulting comments made by President Tayyip Erdogan, a French presidency official said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Erdogan said that Emmanuel Macron’s warning that NATO was suffering from “brain death” reflected a “sick and shallow” understanding and that he should check whether he was not brain dead himself.</p>
      <p>“On the latest excesses by the Turkish president, these are not statements, these are insults,” the official said. “We are expecting president Erdogan to clarify.”</p>
