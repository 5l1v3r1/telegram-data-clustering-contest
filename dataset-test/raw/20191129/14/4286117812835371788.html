      <p>Let's start light. Like two shirts too light. Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff are waging War on Amazon Prime this weekend and if you haven't watched it already, now's your chance. If nothing else, watch it to decide who's a better dancer. Psst, we vote for Hrithik. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/war-movie-review-hrithik-roshan-tiger-shroff-1605495-2019-10-02"><u><b>(Read our review of War)</b></u></a></p>

      <p>What really happened to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose? Now that's a question that's bothered Indians for decades. Srijit Mukherji's Gumnami tries to give you a piece of that mystery by piecing facts together. Catch Prosenjit Chatterjee bring Netaji alive on screen. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/gumnaami-doesn-t-give-a-verdict-it-merely-raises-questions-srijit-mukherji-rebuts-allegations-by-bose-family-1591025-2019-08-24"><u><b>(Read our take on Gumnami)</b></u></a></p>

      <p>Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is on Netflix. We repeat, Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is on Netflix. That's all we're going to say really because we'll be grabbing the popcorn, fluffing the pillow and spreading the blanket to get our watch fortress. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/hollywood/story/the-irishman-trailer-robert-de-niro-returns-to-the-world-of-crime-in-martin-scorsese-film-1603723-2019-09-27"><u><b>(Read our trailer review of The Irishman)</b></u></a></p>

        <b>What to watch: One Mic Stand</b>

      <p>Too serious, was it, The Irishman? One Mic Stand will act as the perfect filler before you move onto the next. It's essentially a stand-up comedy. Now, what's so great about that? Maybe this will help: What happens when one politician, one actress and one music composer take up stand-up comedy for one evening? One hilarious show, that's what! <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/binge-watch/story/shashi-tharoor-turns-stand-up-comedian-for-amazon-prime-series-1616303-2019-11-06"><u><b>(Read our take on One Mic Stand)</b></u></a></p>

      <p>Adapted from Doctor Foster, Out Of Love stars Rasika Dugal and Purab Kohli. But it is not one of those mindless adaptations that blindly mimic an American or British milieu whether or not it renders itself to the Indian context. Definitely worth a watch. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/binge-watch/story/purab-kohli-opens-up-on-out-of-love-crumbling-relationships-and-absence-from-tv-1621770-2019-11-22"><u><b>(Read our interview with Purab Kohli)</b></u></a></p>

        <b>What to watch: Avengers Endgame</b>

      <p>So when we said geek out, we meant geek out. Now even though the Avengers has ended, given Hotstar has it on its menu, we've got to binge-watch, right? This could also mean a re-run of all the other Marvel movies. We'll let you decide that for yourself. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/reviews/story/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-fans-get-a-marvelous-spectacle-in-last-avengers-film-1510666-2019-04-26"><u><b>(Read our take on Avengers Endgame)</b></u></a></p>

        <b>What to watch: The Crown Season 3</b>

      <p>The Queen is obviously at the centre, but the third season of The Crown spends more time exploring the lives of the other members of the royal family. But more importantly, S3 stands out because of a new Queen Elizabeth II - Olivia Colman replaces Claire Foy. A must-binge just for that. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/binge-watch/story/the-crown-season-3-review-strong-olivia-colman-shaky-helena-make-for-a-solid-watch-1620480-2019-11-19"><u><b>(Read our review of The Crown Season 3 here)</b></u></a></p>

      <p>Let's end Sunday on a light note, too. Finding joy and falling in love with the little things! This slice of life show has returned with the third season, and if you haven't binged on the first two, better brush up quick. And maybe in the process, we'd learn to appreciate the little things. Even the Monday that awaits us on the other side. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/binge-watch/story/little-things-3-will-distance-change-the-dynamics-of-dhruv-and-kavya-s-relationship-1607628-2019-10-09"><u><b>(Read our trailer review of Little Things 3)</b></u></a></p>
