      <p>A US company wanting to grow giant redwood trees here to sell the lumber back home has won the right to buy another 4000ha in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Tough restrictions on cutting down Redwood, or Sequoia, in the US means people cannot get enough of it to use as a building material.</p>
      <p>The wood is especially popular for things like decking and outdoor furniture, as it is admired as both attractive and robust.</p>
      <p>To meet the need, the Soper Wheeler Company of California set up the New Zealand Redwood Company in Taupō in 2001.</p>
      <p>New Zealand's moist climate allows higher growth rates for Sequoia than in California.</p>
      <p>The firm has already planted 3000ha of Sequoia here, to sell in the US.</p>
      <p>Now, the Overseas Investment Office (OIO) has just granted the company the right to buy another 4000ha of land in New Zealand in order to plant more Sequoia.</p>
      <p>It's granted the firm what's called a standing consent, which allows the purchase of land which has not yet been identified.</p>
      <p>Similar approval was earlier granted to the Japanese firm PanPac, a decision which generated some controversy.</p>
      <p>Though it is aiming mainly at the US market, the firm also wants to develop markets in New Zealand, Australia and parts of Asia.</p>
      <p>The Redwood decision was just one of several forestry schemes approved by the OIO, which included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>488 hectares for a Swiss scheme in Northland</li>
        <li>522 hectares for a similar Swiss scheme in Otago</li>
        <li>420 hectares of land for British investors in Marlborough</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A proposal to buy 3600ha of mainly dairy country in mid Canterbury by Canadian interests was turned down.</p>
      <p>And the Danish firm DLF seeds was given retrospective approval for a needed piece of land it inadvertently overlooked when it took over the seeds division of PGG Wrightson this year.</p>
