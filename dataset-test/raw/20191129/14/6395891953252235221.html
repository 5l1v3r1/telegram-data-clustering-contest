      <p>Braun left a message on <a href="https://wnep.com/2019/11/28/lonely-talkback-caller-finds-new-friends-on-thanksgiving/">WNEP's</a> "Talkback 16" line Wednesday night, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>"I've got a request. I don't want no food. How about some friends? Fifteen years, I haven't had anybody to spend Thanksgiving with -- my birthday, Christmas, New Year's. It's getting boring as hell, but I love what you're doing to help other people," Braun said in his message.</p>

      <p>More than 100 people braved rainy weather and gathered in Archibald to wish Braun a Happy Thanksgiving, <a href="https://wnep.com/2019/11/28/lonely-talkback-caller-finds-new-friends-on-thanksgiving/">WNEP </a>reported.</p>
      <p>That came after officials at the television station called Braun, 60, a disabled veteran.</p>
      <p>"I seriously thought it was a joke," Braun told <a href="https://wnep.com/2019/11/28/lonely-talkback-caller-finds-new-friends-on-thanksgiving/">WNEP</a>.</p>
      <p>It wasn't. Thanks to word of mouth and social media, people gathered at a park in Archibald to pass along Thanksgiving wishes to the lonely guy.</p>
      <p>"I just could not believe that many people did have open hearts, that cared," Braun told the television station.</p>
      <p>Braun suddenly had an invitation for Thanksgiving dinner and has already been invited to a Christmas Eve bash.</p>
      <p>"In over 25 years, since I lost my mom, this is one of the first Thanksgivings where I can actually say I'm having fun," Braun told <a href="https://wnep.com/2019/11/28/lonely-talkback-caller-finds-new-friends-on-thanksgiving/">WNEP.</a></p>
