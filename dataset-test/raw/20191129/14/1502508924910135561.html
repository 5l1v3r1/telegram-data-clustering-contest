      <h1>Gold eases over doubts on US-China trade war, faces worst month in 3-years</h1>
      <h2>Investors were uncertain about the fate of a 'phase-one' trade deal between the two economies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:34:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold">Gold </a>eased on Friday, but was still on track to post its biggest monthly decline in three years, as investors sought clarity on the US-China trade developments after United States backed anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Spot <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold">gold </a>eased 0.1 % to $1,456.10 per ounce as of 1252 GMT, while US <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold">gold </a>futures inched 0.1% higher to $1,455.30.</p>
      <p>"Gold is trading sideways awaiting clarity on how the Chinese will react to the latest developments on the Chinese-US trade deal. At the moment, a risk-off environment is providing moderate support to gold," said UBS commodity analyst Giovanni Staunovo.</p>
      <p>Investors were uncertain about the fate of a 'phase-one' trade deal between the two economies, after Beijing warned the United States on Thursday it would take "firm counter measures" in response to US legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>This weighed on risk assets, with European shares down for a second session, and provided support to safe-haven gold.</p>
      <p>"I am surprised that gold has managed to hold above $1,450 since there is some bargain hunting. This is a good entry level for the ones who missed out previously," UBS' Staunovo said.</p>
      <p>Gold was, however, down about 3.7% for the month thus far, which could be its biggest monthly decline since November 2016.</p>
      <p>Investors are scaling back rate-cut bets after robust US economic growth data on Wednesday set gold on a likely path to end the week lower for a second straight week.</p>
      <p>"The market is pricing in a reduced probability of a rate cut at the December FOMC meeting," Suki Cooper, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/markets-commodities-precious-metals-1060801.htm">precious metals </a>analyst at Standard Chartered Bank, said through email.</p>
      <p>"We expect the Fed to remain on hold in December and throughout 2020 as long as growth is close to trend and risks of external shocks are moderate."</p>
      <p>Inflation rose to an annual rate of 1.0% in the euro zone in November, according to a first estimate from the European Union's statistics agency, in the midst of fears of a slowdown in the global economy.</p>
      <p>Amongst other precious metals, silver was up 0.4% at $16.95 per ounce, and platinum dropped 0.4% to $898.15, despite being on track to extend gains for a third week.</p>
      <p>Palladium was largely unchanged at $1,840.29 an ounce, and has gained about 3.6% so far this week. The metal, used largely in the making of catalytic converters, hit a record peak of $1,844.50 earlier in the session.</p>
