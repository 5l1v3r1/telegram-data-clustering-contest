      <p>There are some couples who are so in sync they can finish each other’s sentences.</p>
      <p>Then there’s Caitlin Mullins and Annie Fox, who are so intertwined they accidentally proposed to each other at the exact same time. That’s another level of loved up.</p>
      <p>Caitlin and Annie, both 23, had been carrying rings in their pockets and plotting their proposals on a romantic sunrise hike to the highest peak in Georgia, Brasstown Bald.</p>
      <p>As they reached the perfect spot, Caitlin got ready to pull out the ring and pop the question – but was shocked when she noticed Annie was doing the same thing.</p>

      <p>The brilliant bit: the moment was captured on camera, so we can all look at photos of the moment they realised what was going on. Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Caitlin, from Georgia, said: ‘I had absolutely no idea. I’d been planning the proposal for a while.</p>
      <p>‘I thought I was been sneaky, going out on a hike to see the sunset.</p>
      <p>‘I was incredibly shocked when Annie pulled out a ring too. She had no idea.</p>

      <p>‘My face in the photos is 100% pure reaction.’</p>
      <p>Annie admitted that she had been suspicious that a proposal might be coming, but hadn’t been certain.</p>
      <p>The couple had both been planning their separate proposals for weeks when Annie suggested a romantic hike.</p>
      <p>‘We both tricked each other into it,’ said Annie. ‘This is the most open communication there could be in a relationship. We definitely know we’re on the same page.’</p>
      <p>The couple met on a dating app back in October 2018 and say they fell in love the moment they met in real life.</p>

      <p>Annie said: ‘We would never have met in person even though we had billions of mutual friends.</p>
      <p>‘It was pretty much love at first sight. We were both looking for something casual, neither of us expected anything.</p>
      <p>‘Caitlin lived in the next state so it wasn’t convenient but we just couldn’t get away from each other.’</p>

      <p>The couple are planning to have an autumn wedding in 2020 in the same place the double proposal happened.</p>
