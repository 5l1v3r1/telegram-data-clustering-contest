      <p>A soon-to-open Turkish restaurant is set to be a welcome addition to North Burnaby. <a href="https://sarayturkish.com/">Saray Turkish Cuisine</a> has moved into the space on Hastings at Sperling that was previously Socrates Greek Taverna.</p>
      <p>Promising an “ultimate dining experience like none other,” Saray says their culinary team plans to introduce local diners to “lesser known mezes and meat preparations.”</p>
      <p>Mezes, or small plates, are a staple of Turkish cuisine, and Saray’s menu is extensive, featuring things like <i>haydari</i> (yogurt dip), <i>patlican salatasi</i> (eggplant salad), stuffed peppers and grape leaves, and more.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Saray will offer kebabs, doner, and Turkish <i>lahmacun</i>, a kind of flatbread or pizza.</p>
      <p>“At Saray Turkish Cuisine, you will instantly feel as though you walked into the city of Istanbul,” pledges the restaurant.</p>
      <p>To enhance the vibe, Saray will have vibrant decor and live music to enjoy while you feast.</p>
      <p>The restaurant has indicated they hope to be open the first week of December depending on when all city approvals are finalized.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if this Saray is related to the <a href="https://www.yelp.ca/biz/saray-turkish-cuisine-vancouver">Saray Turkish restaurant</a> that operated recently for a couple of year’s in Vancouver’s West End at 851 Denman St., which had moved to that location after closing down a smaller venture in Burnaby on Willingdon.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Saray Turkish Cuisine is located at 6633 E Hastings Street in Burnaby</i>
