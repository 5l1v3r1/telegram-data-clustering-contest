      <h2>Fantastic year for Wirral</h2>

      <p>Wirral is handing over the title of Borough of Culture to Sefton this week - after wowing 400,000 people during a year of mesmerising moments.</p>
      <p>Dazzling explosions of light, sound and colour kicked off the programme in the spring, with 10,000 people packing Hamilton Square for a projection show telling the story of Birkenhead.</p>
      <p>The borough has been on a non-stop cultural journey ever since, from local stories and legends through to the wonders of the universe.</p>
      <p>Highlights have included outdoor spectacle The Witching Hour at Birkenhead Park, Wirral Food and Drink Festival and concerts from The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, The Christians and China Crisis.</p>
      <p>Thousands also enjoyed the first Wirral stage for the OVO Energy Tour of Britain, the River of Light extravaganza and Luke Jerram’s Museum of the Moon, at Birkenhead Town Hall.</p>

      <p>Assistant director for culture &amp; visitor economy at Wirral Council, Lucy Barrow, said there had been an “overwhelmingly positive” re-sponse to the events.</p>
      <p>She told the ECHO: “It’s been a fantastic year and it’s only been possible because we had such brilliant partners and support from volunteers throughout.</p>
      <p>“It enabled us to do something very special in Wirral and showcase what makes it such an amazing place.</p>
      <p>“The Witching Hour was a spectacular performance. I’ve never seen anything like it before and I know many people said similar, and my personal highlight would have to be the Philharmonic performance in Birkenhead Park.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a great year for us and I know it will be a great year for Sefton.”</p>
      <p>Although final figures are still being calculated, Wirral is thought to have benefited from a “signif-icant” economic boost as visitors flocked in – with over 270 volunteers on hand to welcome them.</p>

      <p>The themes for this year’s events were discovery, exploration and the great outdoors, and included events in unexpected locations like New Brighton Dips and West Kirby Marine Lake.</p>
      <p>Wirral’s Borough of Culture year built on 2018’s Imagine Wirral – which included events like the Tall Ships Three Festivals Regatta, New Brighton Revisited, Lost Castles and the Giant Spectacular.</p>
      <p>And the council says Borough of Culture will be a springboard for more exciting events in years to come - with the return of the Open already pencilled in for 2022.</p>
      <p>The Borough of Culture initiat-ive was introduced by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and is designed to encourage cultural activities across the region.</p>
      <p>Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, said: “The Liverpool City Region is the culture capital of the UK and I want it to continue to flourish.</p>
      <p>“From arts, music and food and drinks festivals in Birkenhead Park, to the spectacular Constel-lations installation in West Kirby and the River of Light Fireworks display, Wirral developed a programme of once-in-a-lifetime events that showcased the very best of the borough.</p>
      <p>“I congratulate Wirral Council for creating a Borough of Culture year that brought people together and look forward to seeing what Sefton has planned in 2020.” </p>
