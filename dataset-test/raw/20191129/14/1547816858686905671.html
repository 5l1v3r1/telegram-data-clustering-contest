      <p><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/salman-khan">Salman Khan </a>was to be seen in <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/will-karan-johar-s-next-be-with-salman-khan/5832d038d5dd90b84fd41155">Karan Johar’s ambitious project Shuddhi</a>, but the film got stalled for various reasons. However, now a report in an entertainment portal, Pinkvilla, confirms the film being back on track. Hurray!!! But this hurray is only for the Dabangg Khan and not for KJo. Reports suggest though KJo desired to put this ambitious project of his on the silver screen, the title of his movie has now been registered by Salman’s brother Sohail Khan now. <br/><br/>YUP! So now after a lot of back and forth and reports of the film being shelved, if things fall in place, the movie will be made and might also star Salman Khan in the lead. In this scenario, Sohail will be backing the film in the capacity of a producer.  When KJo had announced Shuddhi, he had initially got on board his K3G, star couple Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor Khan. But the Super 30 actor, exited the project for various reasons, the leading lady and KJo’s close pal too followed in the footsteps.
