        <b><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22219355/the-rock-dwayne-johnson-net-worth/">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson </a>finally made the official announcement last week that he will be playing the famous DC anti-hero <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29799820/the-rock-black-adam/">Black Adam </a>in a standalone movie, after years of anticipation. And now his good friend and repeated co-star <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22972436/kevin-hart-net-worth/">Kevin Hart </a>wants in on the action.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Weve already discussed it," Hart told <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/547140/kevin-hart-wants-dwayne-johnson-to-find-a-role-for-him-in-black-adam-hes-not-going-to-do-it-and-not-put-me-in-it-how-selfish-would-that-be/">ET Canada </a>this week. "We talked about it earlier, so were finding that out. No matter what, hes not going to do it and not put me in it. How selfish would that be?"</p>
      <p>"Weve got to find the part for Kevin in Black Adam within the DC Universe," Johnson said, declining to clarify whether that part would be as an integral figure in the comic book world, or a blink-and-you'll-miss it appearance.</p>
      <p>They made the comments during an interview about their new movie, <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a26809460/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-jumanji-3-instagram/">Jumanji: The Next Level </a>, but the pair have quite the history of appearing on-screen together. In addition to the Jumanji franchise reboot, they both starred in the buddy comedy Central Intelligence, and Hart had a cameo as Air Marshal Dinkley in this year's <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28600918/hobbs-and-shaw-vanessa-kirby-jason-statham-blunder/">Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw </a>.</p>
      <p>Off-screen, Hart and Johnson have a friendly troll war going on, with Hart claiming that his friend <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a27600404/kevin-hart-claims-dwayne-johnson-stole-rock-nickname/">stole the nickname of "The Rock" </a>from him, and Johnson constantly posting condescending comments on Hart's socials, calling him "my son" in reference to his diminutive stature. Even Hart's <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29638089/kevin-hart-car-accident-recovery-update-video/">car accident </a>in September didn't stop the ribbing, with <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28988145/the-rock-kevin-hart-accident-update-car-seat/">Johnson saying </a>: "Thankfully he was strapped in nicely to his car seat."</p>
