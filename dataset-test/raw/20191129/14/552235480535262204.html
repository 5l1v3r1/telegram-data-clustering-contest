      <h1>Neil Lennon insists league is Celtic priority as manager issues Ross County warning</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops are coming off a European high but can't let their focus drop on Sunday.</h2>

      <p>Celtic manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> has warned Sunday's game with Ross County could be "fraught" and called on his players to demonstrate that the Premiership is their priority.</p>
      <p>The Hoops beat Rennes 3-1 in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> last night to ensure that they'll win Group E, but there's no time to bask in the glory of their European run.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: "It is difficult. It is away from home, a quick turnaround and obviously a long travel on Saturday, so we will get the players recovered as quickly as we can.</p>
      <p>"We'll get them in on Saturday, get some second day recovery and then we'll travel.</p>

      <p>"It's a difficult game. We know our priority is the league so we can finish with the European in terms of competitiveness and maybe we can fully concentrate on domestic duties.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-county-fc">Ross County</a> had a really good start to the season. They have just come off a little bit but they are at home.</p>
      <p>"Teams raise their game when we are in town so we know how fraught the game could be. But we're in a good place, not taking anything for granted, and we have to stay really focused now because the games are coming thick and fast."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> are currently top of the league but only goal difference separates them from Rangers.</p>
