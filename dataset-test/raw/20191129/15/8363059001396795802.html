      <p>Apple is known for only ever doing things its own way, and to hell with what everyone else thinks. Or at least that's what happens when dealing with the public, because who the hell knows what happens inside the UFO they call a headquarters. So When Black Friday comes around Apple takes part, but doesn't call it 'Black Friday'</p>
      <p>Instead <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/gifts/shopping-event">Apple is having a four-day 'shopping event' this weekend</a>, and it's just coincidentally at the same time as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
