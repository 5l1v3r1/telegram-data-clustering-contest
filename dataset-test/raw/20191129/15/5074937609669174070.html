      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:51:08+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Apubeo, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Bolgatanga, Nov 28, GNA - President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, will on Friday, November 29, 2019 officially cut sod for the construction of the $750 million Pwalugu Multipurpose Dam and Irrigation Project in the Upper East Region to begin.</p>
      <p>The multipurpose project, which would be completed in four years, is expected to boost agriculture production, increase electricity and serve as a flood control mechanism during torrential rains and floods along the White Volta River.</p>
      <p>The first six months after the sod cutting would be used to conduct further survey and ascertain places that would be affected as a result of the project and necessary relocation and resettlement done.</p>
      <p>The Pwalugu Multipurpose Dam is located on the White Volta River on the boundary of the Upper East and North East Regions, after its completion, it would consist of three components including; a dam with an elevation of 165 metres and a reservoir of 350 square kilometres.</p>
      <p>It would also have a hydroelectric power generation house consisting of two turbines with 60 megawatts of installed capacity and 16.5 megawatts of firm continuous capacity as well as an irrigation scheme consisting of 12 metres high weir and canal networks for about 25, 000 hectares of land.</p>
      <p>The project is expected to boost the growth of Ghana’s economy through increased solar energy supply, ensure effective perennial flood control especially from the spillage of the Bagre Dam in Burkina Faso, which occurs at the White Volta Basin during rainy seasons.</p>
      <p>The largest Irrigation Scheme in the country is expected to enhance agriculture production thereby reducing imports.</p>
      <p>It would attract large-scale commercial farming supported by about 15,000 outgrow farmers and has a potential to increase annual rice and maize production in the country up to 117,000 tonnes and 49,000 tonnes  respectively.</p>
      <p>The Upper East Regional Coordinating Council has indicated that the President would be accompanied by a delegation including; representatives from the Ministries of Energy, Food and Agriculture and the Chinese Embassy.  </p>
      <p>The event will also be attended by traditional authorities, all the Municipal and District Chiefs among others.</p>
      <p>It is scheduled to take place at 09:00 hours at Pwalugu in the Talensi District near the Toll Boot.</p>
