        <b>Earlier this week, Donnacha O'Brien announced his decision to step away from his career as a jockey at the age of 21.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Group One-winning jockey is instead going to concentrate on becoming a trainer.</p>
      <p>Just over a year on from <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/videos/watch-champion-jockey-donnacha-obrien-talks-winners-diet-and-racehorse-attitude-236388"><b>his last appearance</b></a> on our<i> Friday Night Racing</i> show, he joined us to explain why he's decided to swap life on a horse to a career in training them.</p>
      <p>"I was never going to ride forever," he said.</p>
      <p>"So it was just a matter of time before I called it. It was never going to be a good time to retire when you have a job like I did. There were always going to be good horses to look forward to and good races.</p>
      <p>"So it was more I have something else coming up and I think it was just time to move to that chapter."</p>
      <p>O'Brien also added that it was far from a snap decision.</p>
      <p>"I've known for a good while - probably over a year ago," he said.</p>

      <h3>Low Profile</h3>
      <p>"I just wanted to keep it quiet and do it as low profile as possible. And I didn't want to tie myself down to anything and even now when I put out the thing on Twitter, I wanted to leave it as open as possible."</p>
      <p>"I didn't rule out riding again. But as the media do, they locked on and there were headlines, 'O'Brien Quits Saddle' straight away. That's the way it is. I wanted to keep it low profile and I wanted to put it out now so I wouldn't have to deal with it come March. That's why I did it now."</p>
      <p>However, he added that he's going to renew his jockey licence.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if I'll ride again," he continued.</p>
      <p>"It's very possible that I won't. But look, if come March or May and my weight's not too bad and I could have a good ride in a classic, it might be hard to say no.</p>
      <p>"It's very possible I won't ride again - probably likely - but not impossible that I will."</p>
