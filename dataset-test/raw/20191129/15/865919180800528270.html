      <h1>Premier League CEO Pemsel resigns before starting job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:36:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>LONDON — The English Premier League’s search for a new leader hit further troubles on Friday when a second chief executive quit before starting the job running the world’s richest club soccer competition.</p>
      <p>David Pemsel, who was due to leave his position as Guardian Media Group CEO next year, resigned to his new employer a day after a newspaper published leaked private text message exchanges with a woman.</p>
      <p>The league was forced to turn to Pemsel after struggling to fill the leadership position vacated by Richard Scudamore’s departure in 2018.</p>
      <p>Discovery broadcasting executive Susanna Dinnage accepted one of the leading jobs in world soccer but quit in December 2018 before starting at the league.</p>
      <p>Now the league has restarted the search for a CEO.</p>
      <p>“Following media disclosures earlier this week and discussions with David Pemsel, the Premier League has today accepted David’s resignation and he will no longer be joining as chief executive,” the league said in a statement.</p>
