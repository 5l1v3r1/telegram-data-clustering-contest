      <p>On Thursday the 1989 <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fa-cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final’s match commander David Duckenfield was cleared of the gross negligence manslaughter of Reds fans who died at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground.</p>
      <p>Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James died in the disaster, labelled the decision “a disgrace.”</p>
      <p>“The most important thing is our thoughts and love is with the families and we are there for them,” said Klopp.</p>
      <p>“It is a big disappointment, a big frustration and sadness, of course, that this looks like the final verdict.</p>
      <p>“I understand and respect a lot how much they fought, how long they fought, and it shows how much it means to them. But we are there for them, 100 percent.”</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool player and manager Kenny Dalglish, who was in charge of the team at Hillsborough and for whom the disaster took a huge personal toll, added his backing.</p>
      <p>“Like anyone who has seen at close quarters the dignified way that the families have conducted themselves in their fight for justice, [my wife] Marina and I are hugely disappointed by Thursday’s verdict,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>“We had hoped that the families would get the outcome that they wanted and that they clearly deserved, but that hasn’t proven to be the case.</p>
      <p>“The rest of us must now continue to offer whatever support they might need.</p>
      <p>“From a personal point of view, I am immensely proud of everything that the families and their supporters have achieved over the last three decades.</p>
      <p>“In the face of tragedy and with so much against them, they have persevered with the utmost integrity and in a way that shames all who have let them down.</p>
      <p>“I know there cannot be any consolation in a situation like this but I would hope that they can take some comfort from the fact that so many good people will still stand beside them.”</p>
