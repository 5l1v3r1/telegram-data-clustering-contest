      <p>Johannesburg - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has called for an independent audit on power utility Eskom to probe why it repeatedly fails to post profits. </p>
      <p>The union's president Joseph Montisetse says the relationship between Eskom and big mining companies should be probed, claiming that the sale of energy to big mining companies is conducted illicitly.</p>
      <p>“The problem with Eskom is corruption, which is prevalent there. We think that there must be an audit by independent auditors that can discover why Eskom cannot make a profit because we believe that the selling of energy to the bigger companies, especially in the mining industry, is not done in a fair way."</p>
      <p>“Some companies are getting energy at low, low, rate and with the buying of coal from companies there seems to be no standard that is used by Eskom to buy coal,” said Montisetse.</p>
      <p>He said that when it came to procurement at Eskom, there are many companies taking a huge chunk of money from the power utility through fraudulent procurement.</p>
