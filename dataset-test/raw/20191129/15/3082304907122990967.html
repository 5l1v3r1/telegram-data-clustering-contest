      <h1>Jose Mourinho: Consistency the key for improved Dele Alli</h1>

        <b>Dele Alli must build on his performances in the past week by delivering consistently for Tottenham, says Jose Mourinho.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been impressed by Dele Alli in his first two matches as Tottenham head coach but wants to see the midfielder find “a certain base” of consistency.</p>
      <p>Alli had struggled under Mauricio Pochettino this season, yet he has starred in wins against West Ham and Olympiacos since Mourinho replaced the sacked Argentine.</p>
      <p>Mourinho says he has not made any drastic changes to bring the best out of the 23-year-old and wants the England international to maintain the standards he has set.</p>
      <p>“I think you have to speak with [Alli] because it was him not me [who changed the performances],” Mourinho said at a news conference. “I don’t play, I don’t fight, I don’t run.</p>
      <p>“He is doing everything by himself. We just try to give him the right conditions to feel well to do that. I have to say, two fantastic performances.</p>
      <p>“He will not be the man of the match every game. He will have some matches where he will not play as well as he did in these two.</p>
      <p>“He has to keep a certain base, a certain platform of performance where he is never going below that, so let’s keep that base as the objective.</p>
      <p>“He is a fantastic player, young, with all the conditions to develop, so I think he has a bright future and we just want to help him to reach his levels and maintain these levels.”</p>

      <p>Spurs were dealt a blow this week as it was confirmed left-back Ben Davies suffered ankle ligament damage against West Ham.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho insists Davies’ absence will not force him to backtrack on earlier comments suggesting he would not rush into the transfer market in January.</p>
      <p>“No, we have a good squad,” he said. “We have options – Danny Rose is the natural left-back, Jan Vertonghen can do it, he did it already for the club and for the national team.</p>
      <p>“In extra emergency, I think even [Serge] Aurier could give us a hand playing there, and we have options at right back. So with one or two injuries, the squad is fine.</p>
      <p>“[Davies] will be back and we will survive without him. I trust the other people that can play in the same position, like Danny did in the last match.</p>
      <p>“On top of that, I couldn’t be at the game but I watched on video our youth team playing in the Champions League, and we also have [Dennis] Cirkin.</p>
      <p>“Okay, he’s 17, but he’s a kid with a lot of quality, and I look forward to bringing him to train with us and to help his development.”</p>
