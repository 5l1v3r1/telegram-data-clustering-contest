      <p>Supreme Court Justice Neil Hendel apologized today (Friday) for sending condolences to the family of a terrorist who died in Israeli prison.</p>
      <p>"Of course there was no intention of hurting anyone", Hendel said, "I would like to express my sorrow for hurting the bereaved families".</p>
      <p>In the last day, much criticism was heard on social networks against Hendel. who accepted a request by Attorney Kamal Nator, representing murderer Sami Ahad Abu Diak, to delete the petition he filed in the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The attorney sought to delete the petition after the Islamic operative died two days earlier from cancer, while he was incarcerated.</p>
      <p>Abu Diak was sentenced to three life sentences after he murdered 18-year-old Ilya Krivich, a resident of Chomesh, and committed other hostile acts.</p>
      <p>However, the judge's decision caused outrage among bereaved family members when it was discovered that on the decision Judge Hendel wrote: "I instruct deletion of the petition as requested; I participate in the grief of the family."</p>
      <p>Bereaved families responded by saying "a judge should not offer condolences for the death of a terrorist, even after he died in prison."</p>
