      <p>In her letter, 52-year-old Anderson mentioned that raising animals for dairy, meat, eggs, and leather contributes to one-fifth of all human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <blockquote>Urging the Indian Prime Minister to adopt pro-vegan measures, the former model turned actress reportedly highlighted that with India’s innovation and agricultural history, soy and other versatile food items could easily replace the slaughter of animals.</blockquote>
      <p>According to Anderson, who often posts black and white portraits of endangered animals on her Instagram account, veganism is not an option, but a necessity.</p>

      <p>Last month, Anderson wrote to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking him to serve nutritious vegan meals in correctional facilities.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Modi has not yet responded to or addressed Anderson’s request on a public platform.</p>
