      <h1>Second Test: Australia win toss, elect to bat, wicket falls in Adelaide</h1>

        <b>Second Test, day one, Adelaide OVal</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>First innings: Australia 1/70</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Warner 45, Labuschagne 18, 22 overs, early tea break</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pakistan broke through early after Australia won the toss and elected to bat on the opening session of the day-night second Test against Pakistan in Adelaide.</p>
      <p>The Australian openers, David Warner and Joe Burns endured two opening maiden overs before David Warner found a gap backward of point to score the first four runs.</p>
      <p>But Burns fell soon after for just four, caught behind by Mohammad Rizwan off the bowling of Shaheen Shah Afridi – Australia 1-8.</p>
      <p>Warner was joined by Marnus Labuschagne and the pair notched a quickfire 50 partnership to steady the innings.</p>
      <p>Rain brought on an early tea break, with the covers brought out after 22 overs.</p>
      <p>Rain had earlier delayed play by ten minutes, however wet weather is forecast for the majority of the weekend.</p>
      <p>Unchanged from last week’s convincing win at the Gabba, the Aussies are aiming to clean sweep Pakistan in the two-Test series.</p>
      <p>The tourists have made three changes following their first Test drubbing.</p>
      <p>Seamer Mohammad Abbas was recalled after running through Australia in the UAE last year, while teenage quick Muhammad Musa will debut.</p>
      <p>Sixteen-year-old sensation Naseem Shah was dropped following his debut as well as Imran Khan.</p>
      <p>Haris Sohail was also omitted, allowing captain Azhar Ali to move to No.3 and Imam-ul-Huq to come into the team as an opener.</p>

      <p>Azhar said at the toss he would have bowled first anyway, but Paine insisted it was best to bat in the day on what appears a drier-than-usual Adelaide wicket.</p>
      <p>“The wicket looks really good, pink ball, we like to bat first,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There might be a bit of rain around so will be interesting to see how the pink ball handles it.”</p>
      <p>Australia have never lost a pink-ball Test, with Friday the sixth in their history and the fourth to be played at the Adelaide Oval.</p>
      <p>Pakistan meanwhile have played three, having only lost narrowly to Australia in their only day-night clash in the country in 2016 at the Gabba.</p>
      <p>The tourists are still searching for their first Test win on Australian soil since 1995, having lost 13 in a row.</p>
      <p>With a big crowd expected for day one, the tourists earlier lamented that they have two cracks at the home side in this series.</p>
      <p>This summer’s two-Test series is the first time the two teams haven’t met over at least three matches in Australia since 1978-79.</p>
      <p>Two-Test series have become far more common in the UAE, where Pakistan has hosted Australia’s last two visits.</p>
      <p>With harder pitches and extra bounce in Australia, Pakistan’s batters have little time to adjust from the slow and low wickets of the sub-continent, while bowlers are far too often enticed to bowl too short.</p>

      <p>Pakistan captain Azhar Ali said touring sides had to learn how long it takes to build pressure on Australian wickets and he wants a longer series having gone 10 months without a red-ball fixture against any nation.</p>
      <p>“Obviously we always love to play more Tests,” Azhar said. “As the Pakistan team, we don’t play too many Tests. That’s not good for any team.</p>
      <p>“If we play more Tests, we’ll have a better chance to even adjust to different conditions.</p>
      <p>“The last time we played three Tests here, and if you see our batsmen scored hundreds in all Tests.</p>
      <blockquote>This is one country where you can score big runs. And if you get, here early and get more Tests it will be better.”</blockquote>
      <p>Pakistan’s problems exist well beyond Australia. They have played more than two Tests just twice in the last seven series.</p>
