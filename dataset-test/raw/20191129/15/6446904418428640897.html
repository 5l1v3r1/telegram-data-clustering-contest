      <p>IRISH RAIL SERVICES travelling to and from Kerry will be up to 30 minutes late due to a motorist driving through a barrier at a level crossing.</p>
      <p>Iarnród Éireann said that services to and from Kerry will see delays of up to half an hour as a result of the damage caused by the incident at a level crossing in Minish. </p>
      <p>“Road users obey warning signals at level crossings. They are there for your safety and the safety of train passengers,” Irish Rail tweeted after the incident.</p>
      <p>A video shared by Irish Rail shows a car driving through a barrier as it was closing, causing damage. The car continues to drive past the gate on the other side as it rises up. </p>
      <p>This isn’t the first incident of its kind today, as it was <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/level-crossing-4911195-Nov2019/">reported earlier</a> that services were suspended between Sandymount and Lansdowne in Dublin for a period this morning.</p>
      <p>Damage was caused to a barrier at a level cross after a vehicle stopped beneath the barrier before driving through it.  </p>
