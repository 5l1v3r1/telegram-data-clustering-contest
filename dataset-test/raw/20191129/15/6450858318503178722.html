      <h2>This top-tier sonic whitening brush from Philips is just £90 on Amazon for Black Friday - its lowest price ever</h2>

      <p>It’s notoriously difficult to tell what counts as a good deal on an electric toothbrush, as prices tend to be inflated from the outset. So let’s start with this: this is a very good deal on the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean.</p>
      <p>Officially priced at £299.99, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Sonicare-DiamondClean-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B01LWSU3EO?ascsubtag=06-3779225-11-0000000">Amazon has dropped the Philips sonic toothbrush to just £89.99</a> as part of its Black Friday sale - the cheapest that the updated 2019 version of the brush has ever been.</p>
      <p>We haven’t reviewed the latest DiamondClean brush, but the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/health-beauty/philips-sonicare-protectiveclean-6100-3683586/">Sonicare ProtectiveClean 6100 is our favourite electric toothbrush</a> we have tested (and is conveniently down to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3779225-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fappliances%2Fphilips-diamondclean-black-friday-3779225%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips.co.uk%2Fc-p%2FHX6871_47%2Fsonicare-protectiveclean-6100-sonic-electric-toothbrush%2F">exact same price right now</a>), and on paper the DiamondClean should be even better if whitening is your priority.</p>
      <p>There are five cleaning modes - including support for sensitive teeth and gum care - and it includes both a stylish LED puck charger and a charging travel case. You might not even need it though, as the two-week battery life means it’ll cover most holidays with ease.</p>
      <p>Although the full RRP is £300, it’s worth noting that the brush doesn’t usually sell at that much. It’s typically around £150, and has dropped as low as £100 before, but £90 really is the cheapest this particular brush has ever been, and it should be well worth it.</p>
