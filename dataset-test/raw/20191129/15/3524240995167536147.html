      <h1>Acknowledge who built Ilara-Mokin Road, Twitter users tell Fashola</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:32:37+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Oluwakemi Abimbola</a></address>
      <p>Twitter users have urged Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola to acknowledge the individual who built the Ilara-Mokin road in Akure, Ondo State.</p>
      <p>This advice came after Fashola shared two photos on his verified Twitter handle, where he said that he commissioned the six-kilometre road network two weeks ago and stated that it would now be one of the completed projects in the road infrastructure in the country.</p>
      <p>Fashola tweeted, “Two weeks ago I visited Ondo State for the official commissioning of the 6KM road network in Ilara-Mokin, Akure, Ondo State. This marks another completed project in the road sector (sic).”</p>
      <p>Most of the responses demanded he (Fashola) should acknowledge that the road was privately funded.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user, Moonwalker, @NubianDaICE said, “Except that a private citizen built the road not the federal government.”</p>
      <p>Another user, Young Otutu @YoungOtutu said, “‘This marks another completed project in the road sector’ False. This is not a govt project. This was constructed by the owner of Elizade Motors. Please adjust this tweet and don’t take credit for another man’s sweat.”</p>
