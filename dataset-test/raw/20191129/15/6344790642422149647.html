      <p>The director of <i>Doctor Sleep</i> and <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>,<b> Mike Flanagan</b>, has a “killer idea” that he would love to pitch for a new<b><i> A Nightmare on Elm Street </i></b>film.</p>
      <p>It was recently reported that <b>Wes Craven</b>’s estate is taking pitches for a new <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street </i>movie, so it looks like Flanagan will get a chance to make his pitch. While talking to <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3595748/mike-flanagans-single-idea-halloween-pitch-teaseskiller-idea-nightmare-elm-street-exclusive/">Bloody-Disgusting</a>, Flanagan and his writing partner, <b>Kate Siegel</b>, shared their excitement for the idea.</p>
      <p>Siegel said, “Oh, it’s so good.” and Flanagan added:</p>
      <blockquote>“[I’m] dying to get in there to pitch it. If I got to do this it would be so cool.”</blockquote>
      <p>Unfortunately, they don’t go into any details on what the idea is, but Flanagan is a great director and a fantastic storyteller. So, if he made a <i>Nightmare on Elm Street </i>film I’d definitely show up to watch it! I think he’d deliver and great and unique take on Freddy Krueger.</p>
      <p>Would you like to see Flanagan make a<i> Nightmare on Elm Street </i>movie?</p>
