      <p>The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said that the approaching typhoon will follow a track similar to typhoons Glenda and Reming which left hundreds of people dead in 2014 and 2006, respectively.</p>

      <p>PAGASA senior weather specialist Chris Perez said local governments, as well as disaster risk reduction management officials, may look into the track of these previous typhoons to prepare for the onslaught of Typhoon “Kammuri” (international name).</p>
      <p>“Itong dalawang typhoon na ito ay pwedeng maging pattern for disaster preparedness and migitation. Looking back historically, pwede nilang i-double check anu-ano ang mga lugar na grabeng naapektuhan,” Perez noted during a press briefing in PAGASA on Friday.</p>
      <p>Perez suggested that local leaders and disaster mitigation officers should check, as early as now, the areas hit by flash floods and landslides due to Glenda and Reming.</p>
      <p>As of Friday morning, the tropical cyclone was last spotted off 1,470 kilometers east of Southern Luzon while moving slowly northwestward. It now packs a maximum wind strength of 140 kilometers per hour near the center and gusts of up to 170 kilometers per hour</p>
      <p>Kammuri is expected to enter the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) between Saturday night and Sunday morning as a typhoon category and will be given a local name “Tisoy,” the 20th tropical cyclone to hit the country this year.</p>
      <p>The typhoon could make a landfall in Southern Luzon and is expected to bring heavy rains and thunderstorms over parts of Luzon and Samar provinces beginning Monday.</p>
      <p>According to Perez, Kammuri will have almost the same track as Typhoon Glenda in July 2014 which left 106 dead, 1,250 injured, and more than P38 billion worth of damage.</p>
      <p>Glenda hit land as a typhoon at the peak of its intensity of 150 kilometers per hour near the center with gusts of 180 kilometers per hour.</p>
      <p>The typhoon is also expected to pour rains over areas also affected by Typhoon Reming in November 2006 where at least 734 people died, 2,360 were wounded, while at least P5 billion worth of properties were damaged.</p>
      <p>Reming packs a maximum sustained winds of 190 kilometers per hour near the center and gusts of 225 kilometers per hour when it made a landfall, Perez added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the weather state bureau advised the public and the local state officials to coordinate with various government agencies for proper dissemination of information about the typhoon.</p>
