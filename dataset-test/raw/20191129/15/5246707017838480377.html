      <p>Speeding onto a Switch near you next week is <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/must_dash_amigos"><b>Must Dash Amigos</b></a>, a battle racing game made by a team of just two people.</p>
      <p>It's actually the first-ever game from developer miniBeast Games, and has been described as a "piñata-packed, burrito-blasting, foot racing frenzy". The game's development was inspired by titles such as <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe"><b>Mario Kart</b></a>, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/speedrunners"><b>Speedrunners</b></a> and <b>Micro Maniacs</b>, with elements from those being mixed with a generous dollop of humour and Mexican flavour.</p>
      <p>Here's the official eShop description for you to check out:</p>
      <blockquote>Experience a Loco top-down Battle Racer filled with Piñata Stampedes, Avocados and mayhem for up to 4 Players! Must Dash Amigos is a humorous, family friendly fun-fest with controls so simple that anyone can play!<br/><br/>- Leave rivals eating your dust as you blaze past them in Race Mode!<br/>- Dish out the damage in Battle Mode to prove your might<br/>- Compete in Tournaments to truly uncover the worthiest champion!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>To survive in this world you cannot just run; you Must Dash Amigos!</blockquote>
