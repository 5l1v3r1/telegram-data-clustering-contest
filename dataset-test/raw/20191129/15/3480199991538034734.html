      <p>Wolves' keepers have since refused to take the No.1 shirt out of respect to him.</p>
      <p>Rui Patricio and John Ruddy wear 11 and 21 respectively.</p>
      <p>But Ikeme, who says both have touched him with their support, is more than happy for Patricio to start wearing No.1 now.</p>
      <p>"I hope Rui takes it to be honest," he said.</p>

      <p>"It was a nice touch from Rui and John, not to take the shirt.</p>
      <p>"The way John handled it at the time was incredible, and the way Rui has handled it since coming in has been lovely and touching.</p>
      <p>"But Rui, just take the shirt please, mate."</p>
      <p>Ikeme says that with a wide smile on his face, and he is quite happy to talk about what having cancer was like.</p>
      <p>He has left no stone unturned in his new book, Why Not Me?, too.</p>
