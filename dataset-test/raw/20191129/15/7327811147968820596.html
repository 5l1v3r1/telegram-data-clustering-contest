      <p>The band "Grace Potter and the Nocturnals" released more than half a dozen albums, but the lead singer is now making a comeback after she stopped making music for nearly three years.</p>
      <p>The group had a hit with "Tiny Light" and appeared on the soundtrack to Disney's animated film "Tangled," but a period of change in Potter's personal life caused her to question whether or not she still wanted to stay in the business.</p>
      <p>But luckily for her fans, Potter is back to doing what she loves best.</p>
      <p>"I was kind of angry at music - briefly," she said.</p>
      <p>Potter was angry because her career had caused her so much pain.</p>
      <p>"My music made other people happy, but I needed to make sure music was making me happy," Potter said.</p>
      <p>She was married to the drummer of her band when she fell in love with her music producer.</p>
      <p>Eric Valentine and the singer are now married and their son turns 2 years old early next year.</p>
      <p>"I hadn't stopped since I was 19, so I felt like it was the best time to stop, let's grow some roots somewhere," she said.</p>
      <p>Potter said she painted homes, did Venetian plastering and lots of demolition -- which she says is great for working out the demons.</p>
      <p>Now it's hard to believe Potter almost gave up music for good.</p>
      <p>"When I invited it back in, music became a force for good, and a lot of healing," Potter said. "I just thought, you know, music isn't that bad of a job, is it? I really went through this process of like it's kind of a dream situation isn't it, and I think I started to really feel the gratitude."</p>
      <p>Now she has returned to the stage with a new album and a new lease on life -- call it a rocker's redemption.</p>
