      <p>Jason Day has withdrawn from the Presidents Cup due to a back injury, with Byeong Hun An replacing the Australian in the International Team.</p>
      <p>Day had been set to make his fifth appearance at the event, but Ernie Els has now had to call up a replacement in the form of An, who has had three top 10 and eight top-25 finishes in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.</p>
      <p>An’s 15th-placed finish on the International Team standings saw him miss out on an automatic place in Els’ squad, though he has started the 2019-20 season well.</p>
      <p>“We wish Jason well and hope his back recovers quickly. We were eager to have Jason as part of the team at Royal Melbourne and his experience will be missed,” captain Els said in quotes reported by the official Presidents Cup website.</p>
      <p>“The good news is that there were a number of strong and qualified players available to choose from when I made my captain’s selections.</p>
      <p>“To have someone as steady and talented as Ben An puts us in a great position to succeed. Ben played extremely well this fall and throughout the year and he will fit in nicely on this team.”</p>

      <p>The event – which sees the United States, captained by Tiger Woods, take on Els’ International Team – takes place at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club from December 9-15.</p>
      <p>“I’m quite disappointed I won’t be coming home to play in either the Australian Open in Sydney or the Presidents Cup the following week in Melbourne,” said Day.</p>
      <p>“I was quite looking forward to both events. I had been prepping all week in Palm Springs when I was injured. Frustratingly,</p>
      <p>“I look forward to playing at home in the near future. My best to all the competitors in Sydney and my team-mates in Melbourne.”</p>
