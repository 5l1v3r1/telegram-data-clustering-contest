      <h1>Pitso: You Need A Super Team To Win The League</h1>

      <p>Only a “super team” can win you the league in South Africa and guarantee you the CAF Champions League as a cherry on top. </p>
      <p>That’s according to Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane ahead of the Brazilians taking on Petro Luanda of Angola in their group stage opener on Saturday night. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Downs are currently the reigning Absa Premiership title holders, but Mosimane says their schedule requires them to have a squad with incredible depth. </p>
      <p>“To win the league in South Africa, and to win the Champions League, you need a super team because there’s games in hand and you are travelling,” Mosimane told reporters. </p>
      <p>“How do you balance this game (in the league) to the Champions League game? If you play the same team you get injuries and suspensions and whatever else and you don’t have a fresh team against the Angolans. It’s not easy.” </p>
      <p>Mosimane insisted that rival clubs who don’t have the same fixture programme shouldn’t not be compared with Sundowns.   </p>
      <p>“That is why I always say you have to run the same comrades marathon, then you can tell me about the comrades marathon. As long as you don’t run it, you don’t understand it. What is the mood of the Telkom cup compare to the mood of this league game? You get excited then you trip. You don’t know that you are forced to make changes if you don’t run this race,” he argued.</p>
