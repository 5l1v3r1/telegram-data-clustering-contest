      <h1>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi submits resignation amid protests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:22:34+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:22</time> by <a rel="author">Post Wires</a></address>
      <p>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Friday he would offer his resignation to parliament to allow lawmakers to choose a new government, in a move that follows weeks of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/27/iraq-protests-turn-bloody-as-demonstrators-push-for-sweeping-reforms/">violent anti-government protests</a>.</p>
      <p>Abdul Mahdi’s decision came in response to a call for a change of leadership on Friday by Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, his office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“In response to this call, and in order to facilitate it as quickly as possible, I will present to parliament a demand (to accept) my resignation from the leadership of the current government,” said the statement, signed by Abdul Mahdi.</p>
      <p>The statement did not specify when he would tender his resignation. Parliament is due to convene on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The announcement came after weeks of anti-government unrest in which security forces have killed around 400 mostly peaceful demonstrators and the country has careered towards <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/06/iraqi-police-fire-on-protesters-as-anti-government-unrest-grows-death-toll-passes-100/">a serious escalation of violence</a>.</p>
