      <p>MUNICH: BMW and its partner Great Wall Motor said they plan to build a plant in China with a capacity of 160,000 cars per year, and which will produce BMW's electric MINI brand and Great Wall Motor models.</p>
      <p>The €650 million plant is due for completion in 2022.</p>

      <p>Automakers and suppliers are scrambling to meet tough new Chinese quotas for less polluting cars. Those rules call for electric and rechargeable hybrid vehicles to account for a fifth of total sales by 2025.</p>
      <p>The new joint venture Spotlight Automotive, will be based in Zhangjiagang near Shanghai and eventually employ 3,000 staff.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Great Wall gained domestic regulatory approval for the new plant.</p>
      <p>Great Wall is China's top sport utility vehicle and pick-up truck maker. It also builds Ora, an affordable battery electric vehicle brand in Baoding, the city where it is based.</p>
      <p>BMW is following the footsteps of larger peer Volkswagen , which is readying two Chinese factories to build electric cars next year, and which will have a combined production capacity of 600,000 vehicles.</p>
      <p>Tesla is aiming for more than 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai.</p>
