      <h1>Canada: GDP masks sharp improvement in Canadian business investment for Q3 – TDS</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:23:45+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>Commenting on Friday's Gross Domestic Report from Canada, "GDP growth was in line with market expectations, with the Canadian economy growing 1.3% (annualized) in Q3 and 0.1% m/m for September," note TD Securities analysts. "However, details were more positive with domestic demand up 3.2%."</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <p>"Business investment was a key driver to Q3 growth which will come as a relief to the BoC, given their concern with the global outlook. We don't expect this to drive a hawkish pivot next week, but it should allow them some added comfort as they remain on the sidelines."</p>
      <p>"<b>Rates</b>: Muted reaction to an in-line number, and small beat on the YoY (1.60% vs 1.40%). At the margin this report could buy the BoC a bit more time to hold off on cutting rates, had the report been weak, that could have been a big deal."</p>
