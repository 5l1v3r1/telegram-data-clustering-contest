      <h1>Khloe Kardashian Stuns In New Good American Bodysuit — Kris Jenner Calls Her A Goddess</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:48:35+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>Khloe Kardashian modeled a new Good American bodysuit and the Internet is going crazy over how gorgeous the Kardashian sister looks. Even Khloe’s own mother, Kris Jenner, left a comment calling her daughter a “Goddess” and celebrities like Paris Hilton love the look. Khloe shared an outside photo of herself in the bodysuit and a pair of white stilettos. Celebrity stylist Maeve Reilly (who <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/ciara-wore-nine-outfits-at-the-american-music-awards-here-they-are-345616/">just styled</a> Ciara for the AMAs) is behind Khloe’s gorgeous look and the sister looks incredible as she shows off her curves and long legs.</p>
      <p>Khloe is standing in front of a wall with blooming, light pink rose bushes in the background. Celebrity hairstylist Andrew Fitzsimmons did Khloe’s hair in a long, blonde ponytail. He also recently styled Kourtney Kardashian’s <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/khloe-kardashian-is-loving-that-her-fans-love-her-brunette-hair-chris-appleton-works-hair-magic-again-336304/">hair</a> for the KKW Fragrance Diamonds collection. Andrew shared the photo on his own Instagram page and left the following remark.</p>
      <blockquote>“If the ponytail ain’t extra, what’s the point???”</blockquote>
      <p>Khloe recently returned to her brunette hair for the above mentioned KKW Fragrance Diamonds collection campaign, but promptly went back to being a blond despite the favorable praise she received for the look. Andrew slicked Khloe’s mane away from her face, then situated it in a long, ponytail that Khloe held in her hand for the photo.</p>

      <p>Celebrity makeup artist Ash Holm did Khloe’s makeup for the shoot and the look is very similar to the recent Good American Holiday campaign where Khloe modeled the red, Good Night PJs, with a leopard print drawstring. Red is the color of the season and Khloe has been wearing a bold, red lip as opposed to her lighter, more nude colors now that the Christmas season is underway.</p>

      <p>Khloe’s been getting plenty of attention for her lips lately, but a <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/khloe-kardashian-slammed-again-as-her-lips-appear-enormous-in-new-photos-343490/">close-up of her photos</a> will show that her makeup artists are simply outlining her lips above the natural lip line for a fuller effect in her photos.</p>
      <p>What do you think of Khloe Kardashian in her latest Good American bodysuit? Do you agree that it gives support where needed and that Khloe looks like a goddess wearing it?</p>
