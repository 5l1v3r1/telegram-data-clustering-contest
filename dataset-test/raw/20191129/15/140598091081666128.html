      <h1>The best boutique hotels in Oxford, from cosy pubs with rooms to city-centre townhouses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:40:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/e/etain-o-carroll/" target="_blank">Etain O'Carroll</a></address>
      <p>Oxford is renowned for its quirks and eccentricities. Traditions long forgotten or abandoned elsewhere hold fast in a town where clocks run intentionally slow, students can’t walk on the grass, and ducks are serenaded once a century. The city’s hotels are just as characterful and you can bed down in Oscar Wilde’s former party pad, sleep on a rooftop overlooking the city’s most famous landmark, negotiate the drunken floors of a 17th-century cottage or wake up in a former prison cell. Here's our pick of the best boutique hotels in Oxford.</p>

      <p>9 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>The Old Bank brims with character, as you’d expect from three interconnecting buildings which, in part, date back to the 14th century. There’s striking modern art throughout, and many older features have remained, including Georgian alcoves, wood-panelled walls and large sash windows. Book the Superior Deluxe rooms for good views from cushioned window seats onto Oxford’s mellow, limestone buildings, or the Suite, which the best view of city spires and rooftops. Quod Brasserie, formerly the banking hall, is a convivial place to eat. The hotel is surrounded by some of the oldest Oxford colleges, adding to the atmosphere. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/oxford/hotels/old-bank-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 197 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/the-old-bank.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1united0kingdom1england1oxfordshire1oxford1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0oxford-The2Old2Bank">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Ivy-clad Old Parsonage Hotel is next to the church of St Giles, with lovely bell chimes flowing through the windows on Sunday mornings. Through a pretty courtyard with large umbrellas for summer dining, and the original front door believed to date from 1660, you reach the reception hall, with original stone hearth and crackling fire. Then comes the bar and raised restaurant, lined by owner Jeremy Mogford’s eclectic collection of English portraits. The atmosphere is simply charming, from the lovely library/sitting room to the smiling staff. Bedrooms are slick and stylish and beautifully equipped, while the restaurant offers a bistro-style menu that’s simple, straightforward and very tasty. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/oxford/hotels/old-parsonage-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 230 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/old-parsonage.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1united0kingdom1england1oxfordshire1oxford1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0oxford-Old2Parsonage2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>8 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>This elegant, 18th-century Cotswold-stone townhouse was previously used for council offices, but a complete renovation has transformed it into one of the most distinctive hotels in Oxford. Rooms have soothing colour combos and a generous breakfast spread is served in a small courtyard with outdoor tables. Couples keen to explore Oxford can purchase walking package, which combines an overnight stay with an informative two-hour private tour. The hotel’s location – within a few paces of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford Playhouse, many colleges and the main shopping streets – couldn’t be better placed for exploring the sights. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/oxford/hotels/vanbrugh-house-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 143 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/vanbrugh-house.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1united0kingdom1england1oxfordshire1oxford1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0oxford-The2Vanbrugh2House2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This popular riverside pub offers a rollicking Oxford experience in the heart of the city. The hotel flanks a delightful riverside terrace on two sides with historic Folly Bridge on the other. The focus is the huge boatyard, where cheerful blue tables and chairs surround the great old winch and an al fresco bar; planters, heaters and parasols promote riverside revelry all year round. The unique bedrooms, offering comfortable and quirky spaces, occupy the upper floors of the pub. The double aspect Edmond Halley (room 18) is a cosmic delight of star-spangled wallpaper, stellar bathroom tiles and planetary pictures. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/oxford/hotels/the-head-of-the-river-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 90 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/head-of-the-river.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1united0kingdom1england1oxfordshire1oxford1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0oxford-The2Head2of2the2River">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Malmaison Oxford may not have the most romantic origins (its building was used as a prison until 1996) but the old cells have been transformed into opulent bedrooms (complete with original chunky cell doors and bars at the windows). Part of the hotel’s quirky appeal comes from its evident history; with its towers, metal bars at some of the peephole windows and 'The Exercise Yard', now converted to a pleasant garden for relaxing on deckchairs and al fresco dining. Service is excellent, with an amenable Maître d' to the head chef that makes a point of visiting each table to see how guests are enjoying the food. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/oxford/hotels/malmaison-oxford-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 116 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/malmaison-oxford.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1united0kingdom1england1oxfordshire1oxford1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0oxford-Malmaison2Oxford">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>7 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>The Museum Hotel is a compact but beautifully styled retreat in the heart of the city. With very discreet staffing and minimal services, it's ideal for independent-minded guests simply looking for a convenient bolthole in which to relax in peace. It's set in a building rebuilt in medieval times. A 16th-century fireplace in the lounge sits next to a Victorian cast-iron spiral staircase. Exposed beams in the bedrooms and bathrooms add warmth and character. Breakfast is served in trendy St Aldate's Tavern downstairs and includes cooked classics such as a full English or eggs Benedict. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/oxford/hotels/museum-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 133 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/museum-oxford.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1united0kingdom1england1oxfordshire1oxford1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0oxford-Museum2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
