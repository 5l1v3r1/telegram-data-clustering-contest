      <h1>Jerry Jones Became a Perfect SpongeBob Meme During Cowboys Thanksgiving Day Loss vs. Bills (TWEETS)</h1>

      <p>Jerry Jones has lived through a grand total of 78 Thanksgivings, but I can almost guarantee that none of them were worse than his 2019 Thanksgiving Day festivities.</p>
      <p>Not only did his team drastically hurt their playoff chances by losing to the Buffalo Bills, 26-15, but the Cowboys owner was also seen with tears in his eyes while speaking to the media about the loss after the game.</p>
      <p>And if that wasn’t already bad enough, 2018 will also mark the Thanksgiving when Twitter turned Jerry Jones into a SpongeBob meme.</p>
