      <h1>Christian Pulisic inching closer to making American history</h1>

      <p>At just 21, Christian Pulisic is quickly moving up the record books.</p>
      <p>Playing for Chelsea on Wednesday, the American scored his third career goal in the UEFA Champions League. That already makes him the second-most prolific American (tied with Sacha Kljestan) in the competition.</p>
      <p>His latest strike — a virtual tap-in during a 2-2 tie vs. Valencia — means he is halfway to tying DaMarcus Beasley’s current record of six Champions League goals.</p>
      <p>After going goalless in his first nine appearances at Chelsea, Pulisic has found his footing as of late. He now sits at six goals and five assists in all competitions, including five scores in his past four Premier League appearances.</p>
      <p>The attacker may have to wait a bit to break Beasley’s scoring record, but another one could already be broken this season.</p>

      <p>If Chelsea defeats Lille on Dec. 10 to book a spot in the competition’s knockout stages, Pulisic will likely beat or tie Beasley and Jermaine Jones’ joint record of 27 Champions league appearances.</p>
      <p>The wonder-kid sits on 25 after Wednesday’s match.</p>
