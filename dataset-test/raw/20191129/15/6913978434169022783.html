      <p><b>LONDON —</b> British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday dismissed criticism of an old article he wrote condemning single mothers and "feckless" working-class men, saying the quotes were taken out of context.<br/><br/>In a newly-unearthed article from 1995, when he was a journalist, Johnson described working-class men as "likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless".<br/><br/>The quotes were splashed across the front page of the left-wing Daily Mirror tabloid, under the tagline "What he really thinks", putting them center stage of the campaign for the Dec. 12 election.<br/><br/>The newspaper also noted that in the article for the Spectator magazine, the Conservative leader had described children of single mothers as "ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate".<br/><br/>"These are 25-year-old quotations culled from articles written I think before I was even in politics," Johnson told LBC radio on Friday.<br/><br/>He said the "words are lifted out of context" and were an "absolute distortion" of what he believes.<br/><br/>He accused the opposition Labour party, which said the remarks were "outrageous", of digging up old quotes to shift attention away from its policy on Brexit.<br/><br/>"They're just trying to distract from the reality that they have no plan to get out us out of the European Union," Johnson said.<br/><br/>Opinion polls currently show the Conservatives, who have promised to get Britain out of the bloc on Jan. 31, are heading for victory next month.<br/><br/>A major survey on Wednesday suggested they would take several seats from Labour in traditional working-class areas in northern and central England.<br/><br/>Labour chairman Ian Lavery said Johnson's remarks about working-class men were "outrageous".<br/><br/>He accused Johnson of being "a man out of touch with reality and whose ignorance and hatred of working-class communities knows no bounds".<br/><br/>Johnson has previously come under scrutiny for using offensive language in his articles, mostly written before entering politics — but some more recently.<br/><br/>Last year he was criticized for writing that Muslim women in full face veils looked like letter boxes, while defending their right to wear what they want.<br/><br/>The comments fueled questions about a wider problem of Islamophobia in the Conservative party.<br/><br/>"When I write this stuff, I never set out to cause pain or hurt," Johnson said on Friday, repeating a pledge for an independent inquiry into all forms of prejudice within his party. — AFP</p>
