        <b>Unai Emery was sacked as Arsenal head coach on Friday and Frank Lampard has sympathy for the Spaniard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard says it is a “shame” Unai Emery was sacked by Arsenal after giving his all for the club.</p>
      <p>Arsenal announced the 48-year-old’s exit on Friday following a seven-match winless run that culminated in Thursday’s 2-1 Europa League home loss to Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Emery, who lasted just 18 months in the job after succeeding long-serving boss Arsene Wenger, leaves Arsenal eight points adrift of fourth-place Chelsea in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Lampard is sad to see the Spaniard depart but accepts it is part of being a coach.</p>

      <p>“I wouldn’t say it was inevitable, because nothing’s inevitable in football,” he said at Friday’s pre-match news conference.</p>
      <p>“We’re used to a few surprises, especially in the last few weeks. It’s not nice. I know the job, I work hard here and everyone wants to be successful.</p>
      <p>“You have a work ethic and an idea, and it doesn’t always go the way you want it, and clubs then make a decision. We’re all in that category.</p>
      <p>“It’s a shame because from the outside he looks like a man who gave everything in the role, but now he moves on.”</p>

      <p>Chelsea’s next opponents West Ham are also reportedly considering a managerial change, with Manuel Pellegrini under increasing pressure ahead of Saturday’s London derby.</p>
      <p>Defeat at Stamford Bridge could spell the end of Pellegrini’s tenure, but Lampard insists he will not be any less determined to pick up three points this weekend.</p>
      <p>“We all know the ruthless nature of the game now,” he said. “Every team, every group of fans, the owner, everybody wants their team to be successful at all times.</p>
      <p>“Individually, I understood the ruthless nature of the job being a player and now even more as a manager.</p>
      <p>“I will just do my job. West Ham have good individuals, a good team and a good manager. It’s a London derby and we have to be ready for them.”</p>
