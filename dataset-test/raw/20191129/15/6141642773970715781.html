      <p>Liverpool midfielder Fabinho has been ruled out until the new year but manager Jurgen Klopp has no other new injury problems ahead of the visit of Brighton.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international, who was actually suspended this weekend, could be out for six to eight weeks with ankle ligament damage.</p>
      <p>Fellow midfielder Naby Keita has recovered from illness but centre-back Joel Matip faces another scan on a knee problem which has kept him out since October 20.</p>
      <p>Brighton will have Lewis Dunk and young forward Aaron Connolly back for the trip to Anfield.</p>
      <p>Captain Dunk missed the 2-0 loss to Leicester after picking up his fifth caution of the season while Republic of Ireland international Connolly has recently been sidelined with a groin injury.</p>
      <p>Both return for the clash with Liverpool, but Bernardo remains short of match fitness despite featuring for the Under-23s this week and Solly March is a doubt with tightness in his groin.</p>
      <p>Liverpool provisional squad: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Keita, Salah, Firmino, Mane, Adrian, Gomez, Lallana, Shaqiri, Milner, Henderson, Origi, Brewster.</p>
      <p>Brighton provisional squad: Ryan, Button, Dunk, Duffy, Schelotto, Montoya, Burn, Webster, Balogun, Stephens, Propper, Gross, Mooy, March, Alzate, Maupay, Trossard, Murray, Connolly, Jahanbakhsh.</p>
