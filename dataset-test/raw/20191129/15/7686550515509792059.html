      <p>Ospreys chairman Robert Davies has claimed Allen Clarke's situation at the region "became a matter of personal conduct".</p>
      <p>Clarke legally remains an employee of the Ospreys but will not fulfil any coaching role as the region continue to finalise his departure.</p>
      <p>It's emerged Clarke was no longer involved with rugby operations the Ospreys as of Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Full details remain thin on the ground as the region insist they are limited in what they can say for legal reasons.</p>
      <p>But they finally broke their silence on the issue at a press conference on Friday afternoon and gave fans at least some answers on the saga that has been unfolding this week.</p>
      <p>“We’re still in conversations with Allen and that hasn’t been resolved yet,” said managing director Andrew Millward.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing further to say on that and when there is we’ll make a statement. I know that has been frustrating for everyone, us included.</p>
      <p>“There was silence at the beginning of the week and the advice was to make no comment.</p>
      <p>“That didn't help the situation on social media so we made the comment about us having conversations with Allen and that’s where we are today.”</p>

      <p>However, shedding a little bit more light on the situation, Davies added: “I’ve been involved in business for 40 odd years, I’ve been involved in rugby for nearly all of that time.</p>
      <p>“I was at the front of it this week. I was in Geneva and I’ve never experienced anything like it but it became a matter of personal conduct.</p>
      <p>“When it’s a matter of personal conduct, it’s very difficult to comment because of the legal consequences of what you do and say.</p>
      <p>“It’s a well-trodden legal path that you have to follow. You cannot go off piste.</p>
      <p>“That’s what happened at the start of the week, starting at 4:15pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been around a long time, it’s pretty unusual but it’s impossible to say anything other than it is a matter of personal conduct.</p>
      <p>“You can read into that what you want. As of today, Allen Clarke is still, legally, an employee.</p>
      <p>“But he is not in charge of rugby matters.”</p>
      <p>Clarke’s assistants at the region, Carl Hogg and Matt Sherratt will share the responsibility of preparing the side for this weekend’s game against the Cheetahs at the Gnoll.</p>
