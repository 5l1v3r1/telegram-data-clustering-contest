      <h1>Bling it on with a visit to the Scottish jewellery shop that Rita Ora loves</h1>
      <h2>Gold is at it's most popular in years, says John Stewart Jewellers.</h2>

      <p>It’s a favourite with the fashion crowd but gold jewellery is also the Christmas gift that keeps giving.</p>
      <p>From chunky statement rings to stacking bracelets and layered necklaces, gold jewellery has been the comeback trend of 2019 - and there’s no sign of it disappearing.</p>
      <p>John Stewart Jewellers have the biggest stock of gold in Scotland and say customers have also gone mad for anything that’s personalised, from pendants to rings.</p>
      <p>The store, which has branches in Irvine, Ayr, Glasgow and Clydebank, is a favourite with celebs', footballers and sports stars and includes Rita Ora amongst its high profile fans.</p>
      <p>The singer popped into the Glasgow branch and bought a large selection of chains and necklaces, which she later showed off performing on stage and on her Instagram.</p>

      <p>Take inspiration from Rita, who never leaves the house without a selection of impressive jewels, pendants and trinkets, by wearing out-sized earrings and over-sized chain links - the bigger and bolder the better.</p>
      <p>One of John Stewart Jewellers  most popular ranges for Christmas is the exclusive Nomination collection of Italian jewellery for women, men and children, where you can personalise your bracelet with a charm or message.</p>

      <p>With over 30 years of experience they are also well known for bespoke commissioned pieces, from one -off gold pieces to entire diamond sets.</p>
      <p>Because<b> </b>gold retains its high value, it is always worth reusing and remodeling into another piece.</p>
      <p>So if you have old gold jewelery you no longer wear, or that’s out of fashion, the experts at John Stewart can rework it into something you'll love again, at a fraction of the cost.</p>

      <p>Each branch is happy to provide a free consultation to advise on all re-modelling and commission work.</p>
      <p>They also buy gold for cash if you want to clear out any old pieces of jewellery languishing in a drawer at home.</p>
