      <p><b>1.</b> <a href="https://www.aarmy.com/home"><b>AARMY Bootcamp Classes, $185 for 5 Class Credits</b></a><br/>AARMY is the latest boutique group fitness venture to hit New York City. Founded by fitness coaches Akin Akman and Angela Davis, and creative strategist Trey Laird, AARMY’s method is comprised of four training modalities that athletes can personalize based on their individual goals: high-intensity cycling for endurance and cardio training; a range of bootcamp classes for overall conditioning; team lifting circuit classes for strength training; and stretch programs for complete athlete recovery. In September, AARMY opened a pre-launch pop-up in Noho ahead of a planned permanent New York City flagship space in 2020. This January, AARMY will open a second pop-up training facility in West Hollywood, Los Angeles.</p>
