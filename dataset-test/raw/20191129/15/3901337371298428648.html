      <p>Ernst Middendorp was delighted with Kaizer Chiefs’ reaction this week as they bounced back from their disappointing Telkom Knockout defeat with an emphatic 4-0 victory.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Amakhosi have now won seven league games in a row for the first time in 2014, with their dominant performance making sure they kept up their best start to a league campaign since their title-winning campaign under Stuart Baxter in 2014/15. </p>
      <p>There were some that expected the Glamour Boys to hit a bit of a blip on the back of their shock loss at the hands of Maritzburg United in the TKO semi-final last week, but goals from Samir Nurkovic (x2), Siyabonga Ngezana and Dumsani Zuma made sure that that wasn't the case in Cape Town on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>Middendorp, who was named as the Absa Premiership Coach of the Month for September and October earlier this week, was very pleased with the turnaround that he saw from his troops, comparing it to when they were able to recover from their loss v Polokwane City earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website this week, the German said, “The reaction of a team after they have suffered a loss is very important... Just like we did after Sunday’s loss to Maritzburg by winning against Stellenbosch. When we lost to Polokwane City, the team came back strongly, and we have done well in the league since then. The reaction to the loss was positive and it has helped us.”</p>

      <p>Chiefs now have to wait a while before their next game against Bloemfontein Celtic, with that match only being played on December 7. </p>
