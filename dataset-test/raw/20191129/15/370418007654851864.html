      <p><b>Update:</b> Reading &amp; Leeds have just confirmed that Liam Gallagher is indeed headlining next year:</p>

      <p><b>Original story:</b> This time last year we’d already found out all four Reading &amp; Leeds 2019 headliners, with the festival announcing on November 21 that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/foo-fighters/">Foo Fighters</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/twenty-one-pilots/">twenty one pilots</a>, The 1975 and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/post-malone/">Post Malone</a> would be topping the bill at Richfield Park and Bramham Park.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to next year’s event, though, and very little is known about the line-up for Reading &amp; Leeds 2020. Well… until now. It looks as though former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, who has been enjoying an incredibly successful solo career for the past few years, will be performing, having tweeted, “Reading &amp; Leeds c’mon you know.” With the cat seemingly out of the bag, the festival then quoted his post and wrote: “Nice one Liam Gallagher… kept that quiet.”</p>
      <p>Given that just last night Liam headlined London’s O2 Arena – which has a capacity of 20,000 – it only seems right that his name will be right at the very top of the bill, but the festival is yet to confirm his position on the line-up (or, indeed, if the whole thing is just a joke).</p>
      <p>British betting and gambling company Ladbrokes recently unveiled their odds on who might also headline Reading &amp; Leeds 2020 (via <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/best-in-leeds/gigs-clubs/leeds-festival-2020-line-up-17285933">Leeds-live</a>), with the likes of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/royal-blood/">Royal Blood</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/bring-me-the-horizon/">Bring Me The Horizon</a> and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/blink-182/">blink-182</a> on their 16-act shortlist. Elsewhere, The Vaccines, Billie Eilish, Chance The Rapper, The Libertines and Arctic Monkeys are also named as potential headliners.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned…</p>
