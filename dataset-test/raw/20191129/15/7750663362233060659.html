      <p>However, just four points separate Wolves and 14th-placed Newcastle United, which keeps the pressure on these two teams to maintain their recent good form.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nuno-espirito-santo/"><b>Nuno Espirito Santo</b></a> surprised many by naming a full-strength side for Thursday's Europa League clash with Braga in Portugal, and the move paid off as his side sealed their place in the knockout stages with a game to spare.</p>
      <p>However, Nuno, said to be a top managerial target for Arsenal, must now attempt to cope with three top-flight fixtures against Sheffield United, West Ham United and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the space of eight days.</p>
      <p>Having worked their way up to fifth spot, they will be perceived as matches which they need to take advantage of in order to remain in contention for the top six, although their opponents will also feel that Wolves will, at some point, begin to show signs of tiredness.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the west Midlands outfit welcome the Blades to Molineux having put together a five-match unbeaten period in all competitions, which includes two successive triumphs in the Premier League against Aston Villa and Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>As for Sheffield United, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-wilder/"><b>Chris Wilder</b></a> may still not know whether to feel disappointed that his team blew a two-goal lead against Manchester United last weekend or be content that they dug in to claim a point.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/result/result-sheffield-united-salvage-late-draw-after-man-utd-comeback_380495.html">back-and-forth nature of the contest</a>, however, another strong showing produced a point which keeps the Yorkshire side fighting at the right end of the standings.</p>
      <p>The newly-promoted club have now only lost one of their last eight outings in the top flight, and a favourable run of fixtures provides them with a chance to remain in the hunt for a surprise place in the Europa League next season.</p>
      <p>That said, Wilder and his players will not get ahead of themselves at this stage of the campaign, and the motivation ahead of the trip to Wolves will be the chance to extend their unbeaten away streak to seven games.</p>

      <p>Wolves are forced to make at least one alteration due to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/romain-saiss/"><b>Romain Saiss</b></a>'s one-match ban, meaning that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-bennett/"><b>Ryan Bennett</b></a> could earn a recall providing that he has recovered from a groin problem.</p>
      <p>Nuno may opt to rest either <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matt-doherty/"><b>Matt Doherty</b></a> or <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jonny/"><b>Jonny</b></a>, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ruben-vinagre/"><b>Ruben Vinagre</b></a> in line to feature at left wing-back.</p>
      <p>As for Sheffield United, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dean-henderson/"><b>Dean Henderson</b></a> will return between the sticks after being ineligible to face parent club Man United last weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-egan/"><b>John Egan</b></a> has also been passed fit after a head injury, meaning that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/phil-jagielka/"><b>Phil Jagielka</b></a> is likely to drop back down to the substitutes' bench.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lys-mousset/"><b>Lys Mousset</b></a> is a major doubt after sustaining a hamstring injury against United.</p>
      <p><b>Wolverhampton Wanderers possible starting lineup:</b> Patricio; Dendoncker, Coady, Bennett; Doherty, Neves, Moutinho, Vinagre; Traore, Jimenez, Jota</p>
      <p><b>Sheffield United possible starting lineup:</b> Henderson; Basham, Egan, O'Connell; Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens; McBurnie, McGoldrick</p>

      <h3>We say: Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-2 Sheffield United</h3>
      <p>Having had a full week to prepare for this fixture, the visitors will feel that they are well equipped to earn at least a point at Molineux. However, so far, Wolves have shown that they are capable of coping with the demands of European football, and they could do enough to grind out a share of the spoils.</p>
