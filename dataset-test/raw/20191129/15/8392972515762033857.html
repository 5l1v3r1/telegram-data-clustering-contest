      <p>While glitter gravy is nothing new, we're fairly certain we've discovered a Christmas tree decorating idea that could best be described as "different".</p>

      <p>The granules are vegan and all you have to do is take the bauble off your tree on Christmas Day, pop the contents into a gravy jug and add boiling water.</p>
      <p>After a quick stir, serve to enjoy a "shim-merry Christmas dinner".</p>
