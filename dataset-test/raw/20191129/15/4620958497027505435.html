      <p>Burnaby’s Dageraad Brewing has been busy this past week, releasing four beers and ensuring this holiday season will indeed be merry. Here’s a look at where our money’s going this week.</p>
      <h3>Anno 2019 by Dageraad Brewing</h3>

      <p><b>Golden strong ale • 8.5% ABV • 750 mL bottles</b><br/>Dageraad’s annual celebratory year-end beer is a golden strong ale brewed with Okanagan pears and Indian coriander. The beer is bottle conditioned with Brettanomyces claussenii, a strain of wild yeast that adds funky, fruity flavours and slowly develops over time in the bottle, preserving freshness and adding layers of complexity as the beer ages. You’re going to want to buy at least two bottles, so you can try one now and the other in a year or two. If you can wait that long.</p>
      <h3>Entropy No. 11 by Dageraad Brewing</h3>

      <p><b>Barrel-aged lemon saison • 7.0% ABV • 750 mL bottles</b><br/>The latest in Dageraad’s barrel-aged Entropy series is inspired by the whiskey sour cocktail with bright, tart lemon and saison esters on a foundation of deep, rich bourbon, with notes of vanilla and oak.</p>
      <h3>Irresolution by Dageraad Brewing</h3>

      <p><b>Dry-hopped Belgian-style pale ale • 5.5% ABV • 473 mL tall cans</b><br/>Dageraad continues its annual tradition of making a beer with all of its leftover hops. According to the brewery, “Irresolution is different every year, but it’s always designed to brighten the holidays and make you second-guess any rash declarations or promises made in the thrill of the moment on the 31st, or in the stinging morning light on the 1st.”</p>
      <h3>8˚ by (you guessed it) Dageraad Brewing</h3>

      <p><b>Dark sour ale • 8.9% ABV • 650 mL bottles</b><br/>This kettle-soured Belgian-style dubbel is smooth with a hint of caramel and molasses with notes of dark fruit and plum and a lightly tart, dry finish, “that practically begs for another sip,” according to the brewery. At 8.9% ABV, though, you’d better be careful with this one.</p>
