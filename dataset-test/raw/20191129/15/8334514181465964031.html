      <p>Following are twists and turns in their dispute.</p>
      <p>April 2016 - Vivendi agrees to buy Mediaset’s pay-TV business, billed as a major step in billionaire businessman Vincent Bollore’s plan to build a southern European content and video-on-demand powerhouse. The two companies agree to take a 3.5% stake in each other as part of the deal.</p>
      <p>July 2016 - Vivendi backs away from the original deal, proposing an alternative that would give it a bigger direct stake in the broadcaster than originally agreed.</p>
      <p>Vivendi says the main reason for the change is the unreliability of Mediaset Premium’s annual financial forecasts over the 2016-2018 period.</p>
      <p>The deal falls apart as Mediaset rejects the new proposal by Vivendi and announces legal action against the French group.</p>
      <p>Dec. 2016</p>
      <p>Vivendi builds up a 28.8% stake in Mediaset over the month in a moved condemned by the Italian broadcaster.</p>
      <p>April 2017</p>
      <p>An Italian regulator orders Vivendi, which is also the top shareholder in Telecom Italia (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TLIT.MI">TLIT.MI</a>), to cut its stake in either the telecoms group or Mediaset within a year to comply with rules designed to prevent a concentration of power.</p>
      <p>Oct. 2017</p>
      <p>Police raid the Paris headquarters of Vivendi as part of an investigation into alleged market abuse involving its purchase of the Mediaset stake.</p>
      <p>Vivendi says the raid is the result of an “unfounded and unjust complaint” by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose holding company Fininvest is the top investor in Mediaset.</p>
      <p>April 2018</p>
      <p>Vivendi transfers 19.19 percent of its shareholding in Mediaset to a trust to comply with the April 2017 ruling by the Italian communications regulator.</p>
      <p>The legal battle between the two companies continues on multiple fronts, including a 3 billion euro damage request by Mediaset over the failed pay-TV deal and repeated complaints by Vivendi about not being allowed to exercise its voting rights at Mediaset shareholder meetings.</p>
      <p>Sept. 2019</p>
      <p>Mediaset shareholders back a plan, unveiled in June, to create a pan-European media group under a new Dutch holding, fending off opposition from Vivendi.</p>
      <p>Under the plan, both Mediaset and its Spanish unit will be merged into a Dutch company dubbed MediaForEurope (MFE).</p>
      <p>Vivendi, which says the new structure tightens the grip of Fininvest on the group, challenges the plan in court both in Spain and Italy.</p>

      <p>Nov. 2019</p>
      <p>Mediaset raises its stake in German rival ProSiebensat.1 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PSMGn.DE">PSMGn.DE</a>) to 15.1% as it presses ahead with plans to create a pan-European TV platform.</p>
      <p>Mediaset and Vivendi try and hammer out a deal to end their legal stand-off.</p>
