      <p><i>"It was okay,"</i> said Verstappen in the Red Bull garage.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"There are still a few things that we can look at and that we can improve, but on the whole it was a pretty decent day.</i>

      <p>Valterri Bottas topped both sessions and his teammate Lewis Hamilton helped secure a <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> one-two. Verstappen admits it is going to be tough to catch them.</p>
