      <p>FORT MYERS, FL -- A Florida family's Thanksgiving was interrupted by an uninvited guest at the front door: a 9-foot long alligator!<br/><br/>The reptile crawled up on the family's front porch and caused quite the ruckus.<br/><br/>Homeowner Chhaya Beharry heard hissing and banging coming from her front door.<br/><br/>"I looked through the window and sure enough there's a gigantic alligator and his tail was just smacking my door," Beharry said.<br/><br/>The noise not only scared Beharry and her guests but her neighbors too. They reached out to her via Facebook to let her know about the alligator.<br/><br/>"There was golf carts and trucks full of people, they just wanted to see the show, but then I had to tell them to leave just in case anybody got hurt," Beharry said.<br/><br/>Eventually, Florida Wildlife Control arrived to remove the gator, but it did not go quietly.<br/><br/>When agents snagged the gator, he started rolling, knocking over pots and damaging part of Beharry's flower bed.<br/><br/>Gators are a constant problem for many people in Florida. Beharry said this incident reminded her that she should take precautions.<br/><br/>"Just take caution with your animals, your children just don't walk outside in the dark at night because that's when they're out," Beharry said.</p>
