        <b>Dublin city Councillor Hazel Chu has been elected as the new cathaoirleach of The Green Party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Councillor Chu takes up the role following a vote of party members and succeeds Roderic O'Gorman as chair.</p>
      <p>The election was done by a postal ballot, with roughly half of all full members taking part.</p>
      <p>Councillor Chu came narrowly ahead of Councillor Pauline O'Reilly, the party's general election candidate for Galway-West.</p>
      <p>Speaking following the count, Ms Chu said: "I'm delighted to take up the role of cathaoirleach of The Green Party.</p>
      <blockquote>"I believe that The Green Party will have a growing influence in Irish politics in the years ahead and I'm keen that we prepare for that.</blockquote>
      <p>"I want to help get the party ready for the upcoming general election, I want to help develop new branches of the party, and I want to help support new candidates.</p>
      <p>"As climate breakdown, environmental pollution, and inequality emerge as the issues of our time The Green Party are uniquely placed to contribute to Ireland's future.</p>
      <blockquote>"I want to make sure we are ready, as an organisation, to compete right across the country and build support."</blockquote>
      <p>She also thanked Ms O'Reilly "who ran a fantastic campaign".</p>
