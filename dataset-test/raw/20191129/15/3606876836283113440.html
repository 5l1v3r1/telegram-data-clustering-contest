        <b>With just 20 days to go until the release of the ninth and final chapter in the Skywalker Saga, Disney have released a nostalgic featurette on YouTube which takes a look back at the franchise's journey, from 1977's Star Wars through to The Rise of Skywalker. Starting with some footage of <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29267784/harrison-ford-net-worth/">Harrison Ford </a>and <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28698027/luke-skywalker-star-wars-dead-fan-theory/">Mark Hamill </a>laughing on the set of the first movie, it goes on to include quotes from legends like <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29726720/carrie-fisher-leia-organa-jedi-rise-of-skywalker/">Carrie Fisher </a>and <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a29464612/billy-dee-williams-workout-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker/">Billy Dee Williams </a>, as well as comment from newer stars <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29990650/daisy-ridley-star-wars-recap-rap/">Daisy Ridley </a>and <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29798422/john-boyega-finn-bigger-role-rise-skywalker/">John Boyega </a>.</b>

      <p>And in one brief behind-the-scenes shot, an actor can be seen getting into costume as a certain divisive character who hasn't appeared since 1983.</p>
      <p>If you pause the video at 2:43, you'll see Warwick Davis donning the costume for Wicket the Ewok, a character he first played in the conclusion to the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi. Davis was just 11 years old when he got the gig, playing one of the small, furry, teddy bear-like inhabitants of the forest moon of Endor, who comes to the aid of Princess Leia and the Rebels in a fight against the occupying Imperial forces.</p>

        <p>Davis has since played other roles in the Star Wars franchise, but at age 49, this is the first time he has been linked to the character of Wicket again, which can only mean that the Ewok (full name: Wicket W. Warrick) will have a part to play in the epic conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. Perhaps he will show up in the wreckage of the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29575121/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-death-star-location-moon/">second Death Star </a>, which was destroyed in the Endor system and which features heavily in the latest trailer?</p>
        <p>In the featurette, director J.J. Abrams says there is an "inevitability" to this final installment, and given that he has previously <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29843308/jj-abrams-rise-skywalker-star-wars-ending/">promised long-term fans closure </a>with The Rise of Skywalker's ending, it would make sense that we'll see numerous old characters make brief appearances.</p>
