        <b>Chaos ensued during an Inua Mama rally in Wajir County on Friday, November 29 after one Ali Yasin Mohamed alias Almakai hurled teargas to the crowd.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Residents and leaders were forced to scamper for safety as soon as the smoke from the canister started to fill the air.</p>
      <p>The commotion brought the event to a standstill with the audience running away despite pleas by the leaders that everything was okay.</p>

      <p>A source who was at the venue told <i>Kenyans.co.ke</i> that leaders who were on the dais were forced to apologise to the residents as they started streaming back to the venue, with the hope of receiving some of the goodies that the legislators had brought with them.</p>
      <p>The mattresses and the gas cylinders that had been brought by the MPs were scattered all over as the residents fled for dear life. </p>
      <p>According to <i>Nairobi News</i>, Wajir County Commander Stephen Ng’etich stated that the suspect, who hails from Kibra, was captured by residents as he tried to escape during the chaos.</p>
      <p>The residents caught up with him after he drove into a ditch.</p>
      <p>Despite the incident, the leaders went on to address the residents who had returned to the venue with their Chairperson Alice Wahome pocking holes at the recently released BBI report.</p>
      <p>"Kenyans want constitutional change that will affect their lives in a positive way. They want water, they want jobs and so much more. Kenyans do not want to create positions for the political elites," Wahome stated.</p>
      <p>Led by Nominated MP Nasri Sahal, the women donated textbooks and revision materials to schools in Wajir County, gas cylinders to women, umbrella shades to traders, football materials for the youth, wheelchairs for the disables and sewing machines. </p>
