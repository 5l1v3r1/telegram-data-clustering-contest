      <p>This weekend of college football is loaded with tons of rivalry games. Unfortunately, neither Rutgers nor Penn State see each other as rivals as both just recently joined the Big Ten.</p>
      <p>Although it isn’t a rivalry game, there is still plenty to play for. The Scarlet Knights are just hoping to end the season on a high note, which would be not losing by 40 or more at this point.</p>
      <p>As for the Nittany Lions, they want to prove they’re one of the best teams in the Big Ten and fight for a potential Rose Bowl berth. A win on Saturday afternoon will go a long way to accomplishing that feat.</p>
      <p>Penn State fell on the road against Ohio State last weekend and lost starting quarterback Sean Clifford in the process. It’s unclear if he will be able to take the field tomorrow afternoon for the Nittany Lions final game.</p>
      <p>Here are the details for the Penn State-Rutgers game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>3:30 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel:</b> Big Ten Network</p>
      <p><b>Spread: </b>Penn State -40.5</p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>49</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Brandon Gaudin, James Laurinaitis, Elise Menaker</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s Football Power Index, the Nittany Lions have a 99.4-percent chance of defeating the Scarlet Knights on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Backup quarterback Will Levis will get the start if Clifford is unable to go. Can Levis lead the team to victory?</p>
