      <h1>Cole Beasley Demanded That Dak Prescott Give Him His Jersey “NOW” After Bills-Cowboys Game (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>People tend to have mixed reviews about these post-game jersey swaps that have become a new fad across the NFL, but did you ever wonder how these players choose who they’ll swap with?</p>
      <p>In some cases, they probably have pre-arranged agreements with friends from the other team. And in other cases, like after yesterday’s Thanksgiving contest between the Bills and Cowboys, the players have no choice but to flat-out demand a player give them the jersey off their back.</p>
      <p>Following the Bills’ 26-15 victory over Dallas, former Cowboys and current Bills receiver Cole Beasley took the latter approach in getting Dak Prescott’s jersey.</p>
      <p>Beasley clearly wasn’t taking “no” for an answer, as he told Dak to “Give me your jersey NOW!”</p>
