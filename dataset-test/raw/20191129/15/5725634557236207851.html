      <h1>Best And Worst Q4 2019: All Cap Growth ETFs And Mutual Funds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:02:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">David Trainer</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The All Cap Growth style ranks seventh in Q4'19.</li>
        <li>Based on an aggregation of ratings of 26 ETFs and 545 mutual funds in the All Cap Growth style.</li>
        <li>TTAC is our top-rated All Cap Growth ETF and NLAFX is our top-rated All Cap Growth mutual fund.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The All Cap Growth style ranks seventh out of the twelve fund styles as detailed in our <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4308968-q4-2019-investment-style-ratings-etfs-mutual-funds">Q4'19 Style Ratings for ETFs and Mutual Funds</a> report. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4290741-q3-2019-investment-style-ratings-etfs-mutual-funds">Last quarter</a>, the All Cap Growth style ranked ninth. It gets our Neutral rating, which is based on an aggregation of ratings of 26 ETFs and 545 mutual funds in the All Cap Growth style. See a recap of our <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/5357874-q319-style-ratings-recap">Q3'19 Style Ratings here.</a></p>
      <p>Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the style. Not all All Cap Growth style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same. The number of holdings varies widely (from 18 to 2082). This variation creates drastically different investment implications and, therefore, ratings.</p>
      <p>Investors seeking exposure to the All Cap Growth style should buy one of the Attractive-or-better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>Our Robo-Analyst technology[1] empowers our unique<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/863691-predictive-rating-methodology-for-etfs-and-mutual-funds"> ETF and mutual fund rating methodology</a>, which leverages our rigorous analysis of each fund’s holdings.[2] Only our research utilizes the superior data and earnings adjustments featured by the HBS &amp; MIT Sloan paper,<b> “</b><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/5362035-hbs-and-mit-sloan-paper-novel-database-corrects-market-inefficiencies-generates-alpha">Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence</a>.” We think advisors and investors focused on prudent investment decisions should include analysis of fund holdings in their research process for ETFs and mutual funds.</p>

          <b>The Danger Within</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. Put another way, research on fund holdings is necessary due diligence because a fund’s performance is only as good as its holdings’ performance.</p>
      <p>Performance of Holdings = Performance of Fund</p>
      <p>Analyzing each holding within funds is no small task. Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform this diligence with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. More of the biggest names in the financial industry (see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/business/dealbook/blackrock-actively-managed-funds-computer-models.html">At BlackRock, Machines Are Rising Over Managers to Pick Stocks</a>) are now embracing technology to leverage machines in the investment research process. Technology may be the only solution to the dual mandate for research: Cut costs and fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. Investors, clients, advisors and analysts deserve the latest in technology to get the diligence required to make prudent investment decisions.</p>
      <p>Figures 3 and 4 show the rating landscape of all All Cap Growth ETFs and mutual funds.</p>
