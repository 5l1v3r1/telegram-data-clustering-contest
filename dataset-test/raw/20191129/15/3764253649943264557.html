      <p>It was gathered that The Star Wars franchise has spawned multiple films and cartoons. The franchise started with a film trilogy set in medias res—beginning in the middle of the story—which was later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies.</p>
      <p>The original trilogy was released between 1977 and 1983, the prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy began in 2015, and will end in 2019.</p>
      <p>As the latest movie is set to be released, many fans are psyched including one of the leading actors, Boyega who keeps hinting on what is to be expected.</p>
