      <p>Kevin Kennedy played fan favourite Curly Watts in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> for 20 years, a role many viewers would love to see him reprise.</p>
      <p>But the actor, 58, is currently portraying a very different character - and he looks unrecognisable in the role.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Kevin has taken on the role of Cinderella's muddled and confused father Baron Hardup in pantomime at Cambridge Arts Theatre.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity...</a> star Wayne Sleep will play one of the ugly sisters in the production, while Liza Goddard will play the Fairy Godmother.</p>
      <p>Sharing a selfie with his 13,200 Twitter followers, Kevin wrote: "Here we go... Panto time."</p>

      <p>And his fans were quick to comment on his changed appearance - his ruddy nose and cheeks, black eyeliner and hair sticking up on end.</p>
      <p>Many compared the actor to a very famous late comedian, with one typing: "Stan Laurel double!"</p>
      <p>Another said: "AKA Stan Laurel???"</p>
      <p>Kevin left Corrie in 2003, after 20 years playing unlucky-in-love Curly whose ill-fated relationship with Raquel Woolstenhume - aka Sarah Lancashire - had viewers rooting for them both.</p>

      <p>After leaving the ITV soap, Kevin went on to star in Blue Murder, Doctors and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/drama-tv/">Holby City</a> - as well as many stage roles.</p>
      <p>Just this week, Kevin hinted that his character might be returning to the soap.</p>
      <p>Kevin posted a picture of the Corrie studios in Salford onto his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>Alongside the photo, Kevin wrote: "I wonder what goes on here?"</p>

      <p>Fans rushed to tell the former soap star how much they'd love to see him return.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Would love to see you back on the Street."</p>
      <p>A second commented: "A Rovers Return would be amazing."</p>
      <p>A third added: "It would be <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-streets-kevin-kennedy-hints-curly-watts-is-returning-to-the-cobbles/">great if you came back for a visit</a> to see your old friends."</p>
