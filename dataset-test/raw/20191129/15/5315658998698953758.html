      <p>Taxpayers’ Union congratulates New Zealand First for stance on tobacco tax</p>
      <p>
        <b>29 NOVEMBER 2019<br/>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Responding to New Zealand First’s decision to oppose January’s hike in tobacco excise, New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union spokesman Jordan Williams says:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Winston Peters is absolutely correct to highlight how tobacco tax intensifies poverty and crime. NZ First is choosing evidence over emotion – that New Zealand’s eye-wateringly high cigarette taxes are no longer working to get people to quit.”</p>
      <p>“Let’s face it, the only people left smoking are from socioeconomic groups that are driven into poverty by the outrageously high taxes on what is a legal product.”</p>
      <p>“The next step for Mr Peters is to wield his influence in Cabinet to give Parliament a vote on the issue. Recent comments from the National Party suggest they too understand why further tax hikes should be rejected.”</p>
      <p>
