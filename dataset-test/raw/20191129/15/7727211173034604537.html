      <p>The historic lodge house, in the grounds of the former <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/holly-lodge-girls-college">Holly Lodge Girls' College,</a> has been returned to its former glory with smart painted brickwork and a pillared entrance porch.</p>

      <p>Catherine Lacey at Sutton Kersh said: "The properties are unique. I have been selling property in West Derby Village for over 30 years, and Fremont House is a hidden gem.</p>
      <p>"Offering spacious, secluded accommodation and an enviable lifestyle.</p>
      <p>"The wider development was in high demand and, although part of the development, Fremont House enjoys a private entrance set behind gates, and two of the properties come with double garages."</p>
