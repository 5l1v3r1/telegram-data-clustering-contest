      <p>Outspoken Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has once again openly attacked the Warriors technical team over talismanic winger Khama Billiat.</p>
      <p>Billiat took part in Zimbabwe’s two AFCON 2021 qualfiers against Botswana (at home) and Zambia (away) scoring a brace in the latter but reportedly returned to Naturena with a tight harmstring after the international break, forcing him out of Amakhosi’s Telknom Knockout defeat to Maritzburg United.</p>
      <p>After the Maritzburg defeat, the German coach criticised the Joey Antipas-led technical team over the maner in which Billiat was used and yesterday, Middendorp complained once more in that regard.</p>
      <p>No, no,” Middendorp said in an interview with Soccer Laduma, when asked if there is an any sort of communication between him and the Warriors technical team.</p>
      <p>“Serving the country is important, serving the country in Zambia, in Zimbabwe, in South Africa is important and that’s fine, it is a given situation so I have to send (the players), FIFA rules are there, even if he has a broken arm or leg, we have to send them,” he said.</p>
      <p>Middendorp also made made some comparisons between the Zimbabwe technical team and their South African counterparts.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t even know who is the one to talk to in Zimbabwe or Zambia, meanwhile there is a good communication with Molefi (Ntseki), the Bafana coach and with David Notoane at U23 and I think that it should be that the initiative should come out of the camp of the national team, to look in to who is injured and who has an issue.”</p>
