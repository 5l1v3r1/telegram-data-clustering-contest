      <p>The iPhone XR, which launched in September 2018, spent a year as the most popular iPhone, with premium features but a more affordable price tag than its siblings, the now discontinued iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.</p>
      <p>Now we have three new iPhones - the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max - but the iPhone XR has had a price cut and is still available from Apple (with prices starting at £629/$599 if you buy the iPhone XR SIM-free). As a result there are some great iPhone XR deals to be had.</p>
      <p>In this article we bring you the very best iPhone XR deals. There are some great offers available right now. Our experts are continuously scouring the web for the best prices, both SIM-free and on contract.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for Apple's other iPhones, check out our round-up of the best <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/iphone/iphone-11-deals-3702013/">iPhone 11 deals</a>.</p>

      <h3>iPhone XR Cyber Monday best deals</h3>
      <p>Before we run through the information you need to know to tell if it is a good deal, here are some of the best deals we've seen for Cyber Monday. Unfortunately some of the best Black Friday deals, such as a 64GB iPhone XR at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07JZVDRKD?ascsubtag=41-3685300-11-0000000">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/41-3685300-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8663841">Argos</a> and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3685300-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fapple-iphone-xr-ios-6-1-4g-lte-sim-free-64gb%2Fp3769101">John Lewis</a> for just £549 (£80 off) have all run out of stock!</p>
      <p>You could, of course, try <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/41-3685300-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8663841">Argos</a> on the off chance that they still have stock in your area - we found one available at the Clacton Argos if you happen to be in Essex.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Very is still selling the iPhone XR for £599, slightly more than Amazon, Argos and John Lewis were, but crucially they haven't run out yet! <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3685300-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xrnbsp64gbnbsp--yellow%2F1600306218.prd">Get the deal here</a>.</li>
        <li>Mobile Phones Direct has this O2 contract for the iPhone XR 64GB: £0 upfront, £32 a month for 24 months, 120GB Data, Unlimited minutes &amp; texts. Total cost £768. Get the Black Friday deal from MobilePhonesDirect <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3685300-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fiphone%2Fiphone-xr-deals-3685300%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobilephonesdirect.co.uk%2Fbasket%2Fadd%2Fcontract%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-black%2Fo2-4g-45-unlimited-24-120gb-extra-data%2Ffree-delivery%2Fcashback-by-redemption">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>iPhone XR price</h3>
      <p>You can choose between 64GB and 128GB of built-in storage, priced as follows, if you <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr">buy directly from Apple</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>64GB: £629/$599 (Was previously £749/$749)</li>
        <li>128GB: £679/$649 (Was previously £799/$799)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the 128GB iPhone XR just costing a few pounds (or dollars) more than the 64GB model we'd suggest that you choose the model with greater capacity.</p>
      <p>Keep these prices in mind when looking at deals because some third-party resellers may quote the price from before Apple's discount was applied.</p>

      <h3>Best iPhone XR Cyber Monday contract deals</h3>
      <p>While it can be cheaper in the long run to buy an iPhone XR SIM-free, you may prefer signing up for a contract, where you can spread the cost over a year or two. We've got the best contract deals to share with you right here.</p>

      <p>You'll find some of the best deals available in our widget below. It's always up-to-date so you won't miss out on the great deals.</p>
      <h3>Best iPhone XR SIM-free deals</h3>
      <p>If you'd prefer to buy the iPhone XR SIM-free, perhaps because you already have a contract you are happy with, there are plenty of places you'll find it available.</p>
      <p>Even Apple is still selling the iPhone XR. You can buy direct from Apple for £629/$599 (64GB) or £679/$649 (128GB) as a SIM-free deal. Apple will sell it to you for even less if you have another iPhone to trade in.</p>
      <p>On Black Friday we saw <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-XR-64GB-White/dp/B07JZVDRKD?ascsubtag=41-3685300-11-0000000">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/41-3685300-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8663841">Argos</a> and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3685300-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fapple-iphone-xr-ios-6-1-4g-lte-sim-free-64gb%2Fp3769101">John Lewis</a> reduce the price of the iPhone XR to £549, which was £80 off Apple's current price. However, stock quickly ran out so now the best deal on the iPhone XR is with <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3685300-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xrnbsp64gbnbsp--yellow%2F1600306218.prd">Very for £599 here</a>.</p>
      <p>You certainly shouldn't pay more than £629 for the 64GB model! Surprisingly there are plenty of places selling a 64GB iPhone XR for more than Apple is!</p>
      <p>Another thing to look out for is if anywhere is selling the 256GB version that Apple used to sell for £899 but is no longer selling. From time to time Amazon has a 256GB iPhone XR available <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-XR-64GB-Black/dp/B07JZVDRKT?ascsubtag=41-3685300-11-0000000">here</a> for £779, and Argos is also selling it for £779 <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/41-3685300-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/list/shop-for-iphone-xr">here</a>, for example.</p>
