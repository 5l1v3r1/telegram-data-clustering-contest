      <p>Senator Dino Melaye has approached the court to stop the supplementary election of Kogi West Senatorial District scheduled to hold on November 30. Prof. Olayinde Lawal, Returning Officer, Independent National Electoral Commission, had on November 17 declared the senatorial election inconclusive. In that poll, Senator Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress led by a whopping 20,570 votes, after polling 80,118 votes, as against 59,548 votes polled by Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party. Melaye, qho has been crying foul, alleging rigging and called for the cancellation of the poll in a letter posted on his Twitter handle, written by his lawyer, Ricky Tarfa (SAN), asked the electoral body not to proceed with the conduct of the supplementary election.Melaye is seeking for an order of interim injunction restraining INEC from conducting the November 30 supplementary election in Kogi West Senatorial District.According to the letter dated November 30, the matter has been assigned to Justice Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.</p>
