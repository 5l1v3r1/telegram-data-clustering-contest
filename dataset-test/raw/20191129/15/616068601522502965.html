      <p>Members of the North Okanagan Vernon RCMP took on a firefighting role Friday morning and are credited with saving a Lavington home.</p>
      <p>RCMP were called to the residence on Bluenose Road just after 8:45 a.m. Nov. 29, for an attic fire.</p>
      <p>“The area is outside the fire department coverage zone and when officers arrived, the homeowners were scrambling to save their belongings and attempting to put out the fire,” said Const. Jocelyn Noseworthy.</p>
      <p>“Responding officers noted that there was heavy smoke coming from under the roof, and immediately ran to assist with accessing the fire and dousing the hotspots with water. Thanks to the efforts of everyone on scene, the fire was put out. We are extremely grateful that no one was injured in this incident, and that the home was saved."</p>
      <p>This fire is believed to have originated in the chimney of the wood-burning stove.</p>
      <p>Vernon Fire Rescue Cpt. Dan Walker encourages everyone to have their <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Vernon/271517/Chimneys-can-be-fire-hazard">chimney cleaned and inspected</a> on a regular basis to prevent fires.</p>
