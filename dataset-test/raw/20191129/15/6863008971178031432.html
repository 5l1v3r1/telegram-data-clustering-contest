      <p>Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be able to discuss the natural gas issue as part of a meeting in the Normandy format in Paris.</p>
      <p>"In general, there is an understanding that thorough negotiations must first take place at the working level. If there are problematic issues that could not be agreed upon, the presidents will be able to use the summit in Paris, where they will somehow have an opportunity to talk and discuss the gas issue. Time is shrinking, there's time pressure, but intense contacts are underway," Peskov told journalists, according to an UNIAN correspondent.</p>
      <p>He said intensive contacts on gas are underway and it is premature to give any assessment . According to him, negotiations are being conducted through the mediation of the European Commission and in a <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10773278-ukraine-russia-hold-unannounced-bilateral-gas-talks-in-vienna.html">bilateral </a>format, as agreed by the heads of state during the last phone conversation.</p>
