      <h1>Liverpool players lay 96 red roses at Hillsborough Memorial outside Anfield</h1>
      <h2>Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold in touching gesture of support on behalf of whole Liverpool squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:40:39+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sean-bradbury/" target="_blank">Sean Bradbury</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool players Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold laid 96 red roses at the Hillsborough Memorial outside Anfield this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The captain and the Liverpool-born defender also sent a heartfelt message from the whole <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Reds</a> squad in support of victims, families and survivors of the disaster.</p>
      <p>Former police chief David Duckenfield was on Thursday <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/news-opinion/opinion-david-duckenfield-failed-96-17332774">cleared of manslaughter</a> following the deaths of 96 Liverpool supporters unlawfully killed in the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Duckenfield had been match commander at the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield in April 1989.</p>
      <p>The verdict, reached after a seven-week trial at Preston Crown Court, means <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/no-one-held-accountable-unlawful-17334792">no-one will ever be held criminally responsible</a> for the deaths of the innocent men, women and children.</p>
      <p>Today, Henderson and Alexander-Arnold laid 96 red roses at the Hillsborough Memorial outside Liverpool's stadium.</p>

      <p>Speaking in his <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/klopp-liverpool-press-conference-live-17337285">pre-match press conference</a> today ahead of the game against Brighton, Reds manager Jurgen Klopp reiterated the support Liverpool continue to provide the families, campaigners and survivors.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing is our thoughts and love is with the families and we are there for them,” said the Liverpool boss on Friday.</p>
      <p>“It is a big disappointment, a big frustration and sadness, of course, that this looks like the final verdict.</p>
      <p>“I understand and respect a lot how much they fought, how long they fought, and it shows how much it means to them.</p>
      <p>“But we are there for them, 100%.”</p>

      <p>And club legend <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/kenny-dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> also posted a heartfelt message of support on Twitter this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Dalglish said: "Like anyone who has seen at close quarters the dignified way that the families have conducted themselves in their fight for justice, Marina and I are hugely disappointed by Thursday’s verdict.</p>
      <p>“We had hoped that the families would get the outcome that they wanted and that they clearly deserved, but that hasn’t proven to be the case. The rest of us must now continue to offer whatever support they might need.</p>
      <p>“From a personal point of view, I am immensely proud of everything that the families and their supporters have achieved over the last three decades. In the face of tragedy and with so much against them, they have persevered with the utmost integrity and in a way that shames all who have let them down.</p>
      <p>“I know there cannot be any consolation in a situation like this but I would hope that they can take some comfort from the fact that so many good people will still stand beside them.”</p>
