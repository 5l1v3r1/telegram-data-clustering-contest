      <p>The news comes after Rosanna revealed why she hasn’t shared any photos of her daughter’s face.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The couple have shared plenty of sweet photos and videos of their newborn on social media, but have hidden her face in all of them.</p>
      <p>Fans have been dying to see a proper photo of little Sophia, but Rosanna has explained why they’re hesitant to share one.</p>
      <p>Taking to her Instagram Story, Rosanna told her followers: “We’ve decided to keep her little face off the internet for now as we fought hard for this beautiful baba for almost 4 years &amp; feel extra protective over her 💕But she is criminally cute!!”</p>

      <p>Rosanna and Wes flew to an unknown country to welcome their daughter earlier this month.</p>
      <p><a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/rosanna-davison-reveals-her-baby-is-due-today-190769">Their baby was originally due on November 15th</a>, but at the time, the couple said they felt they could be waiting a bit longer to meet their “little miracle.”</p>
      <p>Rosanna and Wes opted for surrogacy, after the model suffered multiple miscarriages.</p>
      <p>The former Miss World <a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/rosanna-davison-reveals-she-blamed-herself-for-not-being-able-to-give-birth-190305">felt that she must be doing something wrong</a>, before she was diagnosed with an immune system disorder which explained why she had suffered miscarriages in the past.</p>
