      <p>The Acer Aspire 5 Slim comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U CPU, 4GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 128GB SSD, as well as a 1080p display with relatively slim bezel. This is an awesome laptop for productivity work, and the price is unbeatable.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Whereas a lot of budget laptops will sacrifice display resolution to make up some of the price, Acer's Aspire 5 Slim hits you with 1080p (FHD) and relatively slim bezel. Above the display is an HD webcam for conferencing, and you get a full backlit keyboard with number pad and sizeable Precision touchpad. The 15-inch chassis is light and thin enough (well less than an inch thick) that you can take it with you without back pain, and the aluminum top cover is resilient against scratches.</p>
