      <p>Jennifer Aniston hosted <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> with her “Friends” costar Courteney Cox, her ex-husband Justin Theroux, and more A-listers.</p>
      <p>The stars reunited at Aniston’s home for a turkey-filled feast, which the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/the-morning-show">“Morning Show”</a> star dubbed “Fakesgiving” since she hosts it every year on the day before Thanksgiving, and documented the gathering on social media.</p>
      <p>Theroux, who got married to Aniston in 2015 and <a href="https://apnews.com/29ef88e81f554ac8a38a763454350cf3">revealed their split in February 2018</a>, posted a selfie with the Friendsgiving attendees, including Will Arnett; <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jason-bateman">Jason Bateman</a> and his wife, Amanda Anka; and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> and his wife, Molly McNearney.</p>
      <p>“Very VERY thankful for these friends and these nights,” Theroux captioned the image shared on his Instagram Story.</p>

      <p>Theroux even shared a video of Cox addressing Aniston during the toast.</p>
      <p>“Jen, I love you so much,” Cox said.</p>
      <p>When Cox caught Theroux recording the moment, she said, “Justin, please stop filming me.”</p>
      <p>“I’m supposed to be recording toasts!” he responded.</p>
      <p>Then he addressed viewers and jokingly said: “I’m so sorry. I’m going to have to cut. Anyway, it’ll be on the DVD commentary.”</p>
      <p>Here’s the video, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/alwayscourteney/status/1200183366328475649">reposted by a fan on Twitter</a>.</p>

      <p>Aniston also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5aLMtwB0am/">shared photos and videos from the event on her Instagram</a>, including an enchilada dish <a href="https://www.insider.com/jennifer-aniston-made-enchiladas-for-jimmy-kimmel-on-thanksgiving-2019-11">she made just for Kimmel</a>, plus a sign that said “Jimmy’s f**king enchiladas.”</p>
      <p>Aniston was poking fun at the late-night host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7ncj4rF-A&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo">calling her out on his show in December</a> and suggesting that the actress make “another special meal” that’s not turkey to avoid eating the same foods two days in a row.</p>
