      <p>Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra will have to prove its majority in a floor test, which will be held on the first day of the state assembly session on Saturday. The newly elected assembly will convene at 2 pm.</p>
      <p>The session will begin with formal introductions of the chief minister, ministers and the leader of the Opposition. Saturday's session will be led by pro-tem Speaker Kalidas Kolambkar as the speaker will be appointed on Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>Once the full House is in order, Governor BS Koshyari will give his ceremonial speech, marking the start of a new assembly session on Monday, December 2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Contention over Speaker's post</b>
      </p>
      <p>As per the power-sharing formula agreed upon by the members of Maha Vikas Aghadi - Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress - the speaker will be elected from Congress MLAs, while a deputy CM will come from NCP camp. The CM post will remain with Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>However, the sources now say that Congress too wants to have its own deputy CM. According to sources, Congress has asked the NCP to keep the speaker's post in lieu of a second deputy CM from Congress. But NCP has not agreed to it.</p>
      <p>If the fresh deal does not go through then the Congress is expected to propose three names for the post of speaker. One of the names will be selected for the post by leaders of all three parties.</p>
      <p>The speaker is scheduled to take oath on Sunday.</p>
