      <p>Amazon has shaved $110 off of the regular price of the Motorola One Action, allowing you to grab one for just $239.</p>
      <p>This is an unlocked smartphone and it does work with all four US carriers – AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. That's what makes this a really good option for a holiday gift.</p>
      <p>Motorola One Action is one of the newer smartphones from Motorola, and it actually aims to be a GoPro that can make calls. Hence the word "Action" in the name.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It sports a triple camera setup on the rear, which has a 12-megapixel, 5-megapixel and a 16-megapixel camera. You'll never a miss a moment with the fast-focusing camera on the One Action. And you can get a nice blur effect (also called "Bokeh") thanks to that 5-megapixel camera which is a depth sensor.</p>
      <p>The 12-megapixel sensor is an ultrawide sensor, so you can get some great action with this camera. You'll be able to fit in about four times more scene in the frame.</p>
      <p>Motorola One Action sports a 6.3-inch 21:9 aspect ratio display. Motorola calls this Cinemavision. You'll be able to enjoy a cinematic experience on this ultra-wide full HD+ display. And you'll also enjoy watching movies in their intended aspect ratio, which is always nice.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It's powered by the Snapdragon 450 chipset – that's a 1.8GHz octa-core chipset – along with a 3000mAh capacity battery. Which Motorola says should last you all day. But if it doesn't, there is rapid charging support available on the Motorola One Action. So you can quickly add some more juice to your smartphone. Which is always a nice thing to have.</p>
      <p>There is also 128GB of storage available on this phone. Which should be plenty, but there is also a micro SD card slot available.</p>
