      <h1>5 things we spotted from Freddie Ljungberg's first training session as Arsenal boss</h1>
      <h2>The Swede took charge of his first session since replacing Unai Emery in the hotseat, with the Spaniard having been sacked on Friday morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:32:35+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg got straight down to work on his first day as Arsenal's new interim manager, as the Swede prepared his side for the weekend trip to Norwich.</p>
      <p>Friday morning's news that Unai Emery had been sacked after 18 months in charge at the Emirates Stadium came as a surprise to no-one, especially after Arsenal's 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Former Gunners star Ljungberg has stepped into the breach in an interim role, with the likes of Nuno Espirito Santo, Carlo Ancelotti, Mikel Arteta and Max Allegri all linked with taking the job on a permanent basis.</p>

      <p>Ljungberg will see this as a perfect chance to make his mark on the role though, and here are some images from his first training session as the No.1.</p>
      <h3>1. Hello again</h3>

      <p>While this is a new appointment, of course Ljungberg isn't a new presence around London Colney.</p>
      <p>The Swede is the former boss of the under-23s and served as Emery's assistant this season, and it was no surprise that he made a beeline for the club's younger players at the session, including Robbie Burton here.</p>
      <p>Many will hope to be involved in the coming weeks.</p>
      <h3>2. Pulling together</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Arsenal's squad has seemed pretty broken in recent weeks, and so Ljungberg's greatest task will be to restore some unity at the club.</p>
      <p>With claims that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-players-openly-mocked-unai-20989732">players were mocking Emery</a> towards the end of his reign, the club's former midfielder surely deserves more respect as he bids to turn things around.</p>
      <h3>3. On the attack</h3>

      <p>He was an exciting, attacking player, and so plenty of people are expecting Ljungberg's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> to be an exciting, attacking outfit when they get down to business at Norwich on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He might want to pay a bit more attention to defence than he is in this picture though.</p>
      <h3>4. Plotting changes</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Ljungberg's first training session was purely for players who didn't start the Frankfurt defeat. and so gave him the perfect opportunity to plot changes for the weekend trip to Norwich.</p>
      <p>The Swede spoke to Lucas Torreira and Reiss Nelson as he sought to get his points across, and his team selection for Sunday certainly will be interesting.</p>
      <h3>5. New manager, same Ozil?</h3>

      <p>We're sure he ran around a <i>bit</i> .</p>
      <p>He must have done, right?</p>
