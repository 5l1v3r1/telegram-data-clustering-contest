      <p>LONDON, Nov 29 — Liverpool midfielder Fabinho will be out for more than a month after suffering ankle ligament damage during this week’s Champions League clash with Napoli, the club said today.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian, who has this season established himself as a first-choice pick for Jurgen Klopp’s Premier League leaders, was substituted after just 18 minutes of the 1-1 draw at Anfield on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have announced that the 26-year-old will play no part in their congested run of 10 games between now and the end of December.</p>
      <p>A club statement read: “Liverpool can confirm Fabinho suffered ankle ligament damage during the Champions League encounter with Napoli in midweek.”</p>
      <p>“Further assessment on the injury has discovered Fabinho will be out of action until the New Year,” it added.</p>
      <p>“The Brazilian will begin a rehabilitation programme with the Reds’ medical team at Melwood as he works his way back to full fitness.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday’s home game against Brighton, Klopp discussed Fabinho’s absence.</p>
      <p>“Absolute bad news,” he said. “We are not 100 per cent sure how long it will take but looks sure he will not take part in the Christmas fixtures. </p>
      <p>“We have solutions for the position. We are not the only team with injuries. We have to find a solution and that’s what we will do.”</p>
      <p>Adam Lallana, Jordan Henderson and Gini Wijnaldum were mentioned as possible stand-ins, with a reshuffle in the centre likely, but Klopp admitted none represented a perfect like-for-like swap.</p>
      <p>“Will the solution be exactly like Fabinho? No, because no-one is like Fabinho,” he said. — AFP</p>
