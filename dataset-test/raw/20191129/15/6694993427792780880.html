      <h1>This is how a children's play area in Gorton looked last night...residents aren't happy</h1>
      <h2>Equipment and benches were left submerged in water at Sunnybrow Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:45:45+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Slater, https://www.facebook.com/chrisslaterMEN</a></address>
      <p>A children's play area was left under water after a park <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gorton">in Gorton</a> badly flooded.</p>
      <p>Locals say it is the third time this year it has happened at Sunnybrow Park off Hyde Road.</p>
      <p>The park, which opened in 1905 and is named after a farm of the same name which stood on the site, is set in a natural steep valley.</p>
      <p>The Gore Brook, a fast flowing stream which runs under Hyde Road from Gorton Reservoir, runs through the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>The park is popular with both dog walkers and parents.</p>
      <p>But in bad weather, nearby residents say it is common for the area to be flooded if the culverts become blocked.</p>

      <p>On Thursday evening, after a day of heavy rain, a huge swathe of the council run park was left under water.</p>
      <p>Equipment such as swings and a climbing frame in a children's play area was submerged in what appeared to be several feet of water. Benches were barely visible.</p>
      <p>A bridge which allows people to walk over the brook was also completely flooded, meaning people could not cross it and were forced to walk round.</p>
      <p>The council say leaves which have fallen from trees in the park blocked a culvert with heavy rain, causing water to back up and pool at the bottom of the valley.</p>
      <p>The water had subsided when the <i>Manchester Evening News </i>visited the park on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>But nearby residents said they believed action needed to be taken to prevent a repeat.</p>

      <p>"It was really bad" said Philip Jackson, 72, who lives facing the park.</p>
      <p>"Unbelievable. I don't know how deep it was but I wasn't about to go down there and find out.</p>

      <p>"I've been here 19 years now and it seems to happen whenever there's a bit of rain. That is always the first place it floods.</p>
      <p>"It's not good really. It puts the whole park out of action.</p>
      <p>"It's dangerous as well, there being that much water at a place that's meant for kids.</p>

      <p>"The brook is always full of rubbish and I think it needs cleaning out as there's obviously a blockage somewhere."</p>
      <p>Frank Ekgren, 74, said: "It was completely underwater.</p>
      <p>"I walk my dog Tia here every day and it's at least the third time this year it's happened, where the bridge is not crossable.</p>

      <p>"It's certainly not ideal when you've got a lot of elderly people and kids around.</p>
      <p>"It leaves it really dirty with all the mud and silt and people could slip on it."</p>
      <p>A Manchester City Council spokesman said: "High levels of rainfall, combined with seasonal leaf-fall, caused a culvert in the brook which runs through Sunny Brow Park to be blocked.Â </p>
      <p>"The situation has now been resolved and we are reviewing arrangements for how the area is inspected and cleared in future, to mitigate against the risk of further flooding."</p>
