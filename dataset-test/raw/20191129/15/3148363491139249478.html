      <h1>Black Friday Brawling Goes Digital | Breitbart</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:54:26+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">John Carney</a></address>
      <p>The days of the big Black Friday brawls may be behind us. But customers are still jostling each other out of the way in search of bargains.</p>
      <p>The difference is that now they are doing it online.</p>
      <p>Surging traffic slowed or brought down the online stores of several big retailers, according to CNBC.</p>
      <p>Despite the slowdowns, digital shoppers have set a new record for Thanksgiving spending. Consumers spent around $4.2 billion online on Thanksgiving, 14.5 percent more than last year and the highest on record. That beats the National Retail Federation’s forecast for 11 percent to 14 percent growth.</p>
      <p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/costcos-website-goes-down-on-thanksgiving-others-see-outages.html">reported</a> that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=COST">Costco</a>’s website went down entirely for a period of time early on Thanksgiving Day.</p>
      <p>“The website is currently experiencing longer than normal response times. Please note that all Thanksgiving Day-only promotions have been extended into Friday November 29th, WHILE SUPPLIES LAST. We apologize for any inconvenience,” a banner atop the site said on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Website problems were also reported for apparel retailer H&amp;M and Home Depot. There were complaints on social media about slowness at Target and Walmart’s webiste but as of 10 A.M. both websites seemed the be working well.</p>
      <p>Online stores can be overwhelmed when too many would-be customers attempt to access them at once. It’s the digital equivalent of customers tripping over each other to rush into a store’s doors or even an instore punch-up over a much coveted item. Fortunately, no one actually suffers a black-eye or worse physical injury when customers battle each other digitally.</p>
