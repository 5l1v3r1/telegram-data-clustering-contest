      <p>Huawei Technologies has decided to challenge a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision barring U.S. rural carrier customers from tapping an US$8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the Chinese company, Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Huawei Technologies has decided to challenge a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision barring U.S. rural carrier customers from tapping an US$8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the Chinese company, Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Last week, the U.S. telecommunications regulator voted to propose requiring carriers to remove and replace equipment from Huawei from existing networks. The move could eliminate a key source of funding for Huawei's biggest U.S. business - telecoms equipment.</p>

      <p>Huawei is expected to file a suit challenging the FCC decision next week in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The company is expected to make an announcement about the legal case at its Shenzhen headquarters next week, the report added.</p>
      <p>"We don't comment on speculation," Huawei spokesman in Shenzhen told Reuters.</p>
      <p>To contest the FCC order, Huawei has 30 days from the day the telecommunications regulator voted on Nov. 22.</p>
