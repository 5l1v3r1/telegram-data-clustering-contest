      <p>OTTAWA — A police officer stepped over the line when he detained a Quebec woman for refusing to hold onto an escalator handrail, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled Friday while also slamming Montreal's transit authority.</p>
      <p>In its unanimous ruling, the court found Bela Kosoian was within her rights when she refused to obey an unlawful order, and that a reasonable police officer would not have considered refusing to abide by a caution-notice pictogram on the escalator to be an offence.</p>
      <p>The Societe de transport de Montreal "for its part, committed a fault by teaching police officers that the pictogram in question imposed an obligation to hold the handrail," adds the ruling, written by Justice Suzanne Cote.</p>
      <p>Kosoian is entitled to a total of $20,000 in damages from Const. Fabio Camacho, the City of Laval as Camacho's employer, and the STM, the court ruled.</p>
      <p>Kosoian was in a subway station in the Montreal suburb of Laval in 2009 when Camacho told her to respect the pictogram bearing the instruction, "Hold the handrail."</p>
      <p>She replied that she did not consider the image, which also featured the word "Careful," to be an obligation, declined to hold the handrail and refused to identity herself.</p>
      <p>Officers detained Kosoian for about 30 minutes before letting her go with two tickets: one for $100 for disobeying a pictogram and another for $320 for obstructing the work of an inspector.</p>
      <p>She was acquitted of the infractions in Montreal municipal court in 2012 and subsequently filed a $45,000 lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Her suit was rejected by Quebec court in 2015 and two years later by the Quebec Court of Appeal, which said Kosoian was the "author of her own misfortune."</p>
      <p>But the Supreme Court found Kosoian "was entitled to refuse to obey an unlawful order."</p>
