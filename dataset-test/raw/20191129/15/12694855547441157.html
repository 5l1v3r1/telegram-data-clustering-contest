      <p>Right now, ShopTo is offering 12 months of Sony’s online subscription service for just £29.85, a significant decrease when compared to the usual retail price – especially after a recent increase. </p>
      <p>We continually check thousands of prices to show you the best deals. If you buy a product through our site we will earn a small commission from the retailer – a sort of automated referral fee – but our reviewers are always kept separate from this process. You can read more about how we make money in our <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/info/trusted-reviews-ethics-policy-3521647#how-we-make-money">Ethics Policy.</a></p>
      <p>If your membership is running out or you’re simply looking to save a few months for a rainy day, this is the perfect deal for you. Just double check if your automatic renewal is turned on or off after redeeming this code when purchased – since you’ll charged once again when its time to renew. </p>
      <p>PlayStation Plus allows you to partake online multiplayer across Sony platforms while also gaining access to a number of other benefits such as a free slate of monthly games, digital discounts and other bonuses including early access trials and the occasional random surprise. Over time, being a member normally pays for itself in terms of returns. </p>
      <p>The free games available to subscribers this month include Team Ninja’s <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nioh">Nioh</a> and Red Barrel Game’s <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/outlast-2">Outlast 2</a>. Both of these titles are well worth experiencing, especially the latter. Nioh is a fiercely difficult action-adventure title set within the plains of Feudal Japan.</p>
      <p>You play as a mysterious hero who finds himself stranded on island after suffering defeat at hands of his nemesis. From here, you must explore the perilous world in search of answers, gathering resources and defeating increasingly difficult enemies on your way.</p>

      <p>Outlast 2 is a first-person survival horror affair with a focus on grotesque body horror and heart-racing jumpscares. It’s far from subtle, but sometimes that’s exactly what we love to see from the genre. This is a hugely diverse duo of titles that are very easy to recommend if you’re a new or long-running subscriber.</p>
      <p>Unlike other sites, we thoroughly review everything we recommend, using industry standard tests to evaluate products. We’ll always tell you what we find. We may get a commission if you buy via our price links. Tell us what you think – <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/friday-emails-3714925">email the Editor</a></p>
