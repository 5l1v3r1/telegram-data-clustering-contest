      <h2>The plan is to construct them around a big fishing lake</h2>

      <p>Plans for 10 luxury holiday homes near a South Derbyshire village have been submitted.</p>
      <p>The application, from Mr and Mrs S Calladine, would see the holiday homes built on land off Park Road, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/overseal">north of Overseal</a>, close to Rickmanâ€™s Corner, opposite an existing trailer park.</p>
      <p>It appears that the holiday homes would be built by a Welsh firm based in Newport called Stately-Albion Ltd - claimed to be Europe's oldest park home manufacturer.</p>
      <p>A brochure submitted with the application to South Derbyshire District Council says the lodges aim to provide "traditional beauty with all the frills of modern day living".</p>
      <p>They have a typical single-storey lodge appearance on the outside, with a modern and fully-kitted-out interior.</p>
      <p>The single storey lodges would have high vaulted ceilings to make it more spacious.</p>

      <p>The holiday homes are either two-bedroom or three-bedroom and have an open-plan living room, dining room and kitchen, along with two toilets, a shower and a bath.</p>
      <p>Two-bedroomed options include a double bedroom and a second room with two single beds.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, three-bedroomed lodges include a double bedroom and two rooms with two single beds in each.</p>

      <p>If approved, the project will include 20 parking spaces and a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/overseal">large fishing lake</a>, around which the holiday homes would sit, and create five jobs.</p>
      <p>Access would some from a new entrance from Park Road.</p>
      <p>A business case submitted with the application said: "The applicant researched the need for additional tourist accommodation in this area, and established that despite there being four similar sites which offered holiday lodge accommodation locally, there is still a high demand for further units.</p>
      <p>"There is a high level of occupation at the nearby sites and frequently these cannot supply sufficient accommodation to meet the increased need in this locality for visitors who wish to stay within the National Forest."</p>
      <p>The business case says that the lodges would be at least three-quarters full at all times of year.</p>
      <p>South Derbyshire District Council will make a decision on the plans in the next few months.</p>
