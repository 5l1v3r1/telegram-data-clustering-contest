      <p>Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja</p>
      <p>The Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, has said the Federal Government would support the new five year Country Partnership Programme of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation.</p>
      <p>He said this on Friday in Abuja during a partnership roundtable on the UNIDO country programme.</p>
      <p>The Country Programme has a budget of $56.6m and the Federal Government is expected to provide half of it as government counterpart contribution while UNIDO would work with the Government to mobilise the balance from other Partners.</p>
      <p>The minister urged UNIDO to ensure that it works closely with relevant stakeholders to ensure the smooth implementation of the Country Programme.</p>
      <p>He added that such a partnership would complement the government’s economic programmes aimed at diversifying revenue generation and employment creation.</p>
      <p>He further pledged the government’s commitment to the country partnership agreement signed with UNIDO and said that the government would do its best to fulfill its part of the agreement by contributing its counterpart fund.</p>
      <p>He said there was need for donor agencies and development partners in the country to cooperate with government in its effort to streamline their support to the country</p>
      <p>Agba said the cooperation by the donors and development partners would help to align their support to the country’s priority areas and make for better coordination of their activities and programmes in the country.</p>
      <p>The UNIDO Representative to ECOWAS and Regional Director, Nigeria Hub Office, Mr Jean Bakole, commended the Federal Government for its strong commitment and support to UNIDO’s activities in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He said that the new UNIDO-Nigeria Country Programme was designed in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s policy of industrialisation.</p>
      <p>He said, “Nigeria is one of the country that has provided a substantial part of of its contribution to our country programme.</p>
      <p>“UNIDO’s last country programme was about $30m and Nigeria contributed about $10m.</p>
      <p>“Nigeria is ready to contribute it’s counterpart funding to this one. We want all of us to assist the country industrialise it’s economy.</p>
      <p>“We can’t stop migration without creating jobs for the people, we can’t create industrialisation without supporting MSME. We will work with all partners and no one will be left behind.”</p>
