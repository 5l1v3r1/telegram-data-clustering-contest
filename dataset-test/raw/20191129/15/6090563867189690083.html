      <p>The government has assured the nation that issuance of passports will improve as authorities are working to resolve the problems being experienced at the Registrar General’s Office.</p>
      <p>The assurance came as some desperate passport seekers in Mashonaland East Province have resorted to pitching tents near the Marondera Registrar General’s Office while they wait to be served.</p>
      <p>In an interview with ZBC News, the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Mike Madiro said the government is aware of the current situation and is working on a permanent solution.</p>
      <p>“It is regrettable that people are having to endure such conditions, but, as government, we are working flat out to ensure they get their service,” said deputy minister Madiro.</p>
      <p>The passport seekers said they were left with no choice than to sleep at the government office awaiting to be served.</p>
      <p>“We are having to sleep in the open as we wait to be served. We have been here for days and we don’t know when we will be assisted,” said one passport seeker said.</p>
      <p>“We are appealing to government to increase the number of people who are served per day so we are all served,” pleaded another.</p>
      <p>In an effort to maintain order, the passport seekers organise themselves by writing their names in a book which they use the next day with each person getting a number.</p>
      <p>“We have resorted to using this book to maintain order as some people just come in the morning and jump the queue,” said a member of the group.</p>
      <p>With nine administrative districts, Mashonaland East has only one office which issues the travel documents, which has left the Registrar General’s Office dealing with huge numbers of pasport seekers.</p>
      <p>The government last week hinted on increasing passport fees in order to meet production costs and in turn improving service delivery.</p>
