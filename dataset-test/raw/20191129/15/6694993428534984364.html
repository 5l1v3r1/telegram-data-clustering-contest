      <h1>Manchester United great Gary Neville hammers Arsenal squad after Unai Emery sacking</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd favourite Gary Neville has blamed the Arsenal squad for their role in Unai Emery's sacking as first-team manager.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:30:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Fay, https://www.facebook.com/RichFayMEN/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville has hammered Arsenal's 'average bunch of players' for letting down Unai Emery during his time at the club.</p>
      <p>Emery was sacked as <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager on Friday morning following defeat at home to Frankfurt in the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have failed to win in any of their last seven games, a series of results which represents their worst run without a victory since February 1992, which was eight games under George Graham.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are currently eight points of the top-four already this season, but <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville">Neville</a> does not believe Emery should be held solely accountable for their failings as a club.</p>
      <p>"Let's be clear about this, these defenders are uncoachable," Neville said on Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p>"I don't know who has been responsible for recruitment at Arsenal over the last two or three years but if I was in the boardroom I would be giving that lot a right rocket after watching some of the shambles.</p>
      <p>"There is no way Unai Emery is telling David Luiz to step up two or three times to play offside or some of the hideous things you see from other defenders and midfield players.</p>
      <p>"You think of Xhaka the other week. Emery is a man of honour and you see his behaviour. This is something far deeper than the coach.</p>
      <p>"He is potentially sailing over the shores of the Channel this afternoon and is very happy to leave behind what is quite simply a very average bunch of players.</p>
      <p>"The coach will ultimately take the fall but some of the things we were seeing on the pitch was fantasy football.</p>
      <p>"Without a shadow of a doubt they have let him down. The recruitment has been truly pathetic. You couldn't find a more erratic bunch of players in terms of defending to watch.</p>
      <p>"If you were to say 'go out and find the three or four most erratic defenders in Europe' it seems like that has been the brief.Â </p>
      <p>"Some of the players aren't up to it, they aren't of the quality for Arsenal's level."</p>
