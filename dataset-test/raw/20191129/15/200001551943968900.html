      <p>Managerial issues are the biggest topic around Arsenal right now, but that doesn’t mean everything else around the club has come to a standstill.</p>
      <p>There are still transfer windows to prepare for, players to be identified and presented as possibilities to any new manager, and the Gunners are getting on with it.</p>
      <p>Italian newspaper <a href="http://ilmattino.it/">Il Mattino</a> has a Salerno edition, and deep within the Friday version of that there’s a claim of Arsenal interest in a Salernitana player.</p>
      <p>The Serie B side play Ascoli on Saturday afternoon, and an Arsenal official has asked for accreditation at the match. He’s expected to draw up reports on several players from the home side, with Sofian Kiyine the name picked out by Il Mattino.</p>
      <p>Kiyine is a 22 year old from Belgium, who signed for Lazio in the summer from Chievo. The Rome club immediately loaned him out to Salernitana and he’s made 14 appearances so far, scoring give goals in the process.</p>

      <p>He usually plays on the left, anywhere from left back to left wing, and, judging from his matches on Wyscout, he’s a very versatile player.</p>
