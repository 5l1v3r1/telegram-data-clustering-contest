        <b>Playing the wife of a warrior isn't easy. Often we see the wives proving to be a silent support system to the husband. In this case, we wanted to know if Kriti Sanon's Parvati Bai is just the same to Arjun Kapoor's Sadashiv Rao Bhau in Panipat. Here's what the actors told us</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve seen period films especially those based on the lives of warriors, you would have noticed that the warrior’s wife turns out to be a silent support system. When we saw the<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/panipat-trailer-this-period-drama-starring-arjun-kapoor-kriti-sanon-and-sanjay-dutt-is-high-on-action-and-grandeur/5dc119a787fb571eff7e36a5"> trailer of Panipat that stars Arjun Kapoor as Sadashiv Rao Bhau and Kriti Sanon as his wife Parvati Bai,</a> we asked the duo if Kriti’s character is a silent pillar of strength to Arjun in the film.</p>
      <p>Arjun Kapoor disagrees as he states that a pillar of strength can never be silent. He adds that Kriti’s character is talkative and has violent streaks too in the movie. On the other hand, Kriti began by explaining how pleasantly surprised she was to be offered this role.</p>

      <p>Kriti began by saying, “When Ashu sir gave me a call and thought of me to fit into one of his worlds, it was a big deal because the world he creates is very magical and it is meant for the big screen. But I was more surprised by the fact that he could imagine me as a Maharashtrian and as Parvatibai. I’m a Punjabi from Delhi so the things that I have done here have not been anything close to that.”</p>

      <p>It definitely wasn’t easy initially for the actress but she says that once she got into the costume of the nauvari saree with the makeup, she was game for it. Then, the last and the most important step was to have self-belief and confidence in her abilities.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the film, it is helmed by Ashutosh Gowariker and also stars Sanjay Dutt who plays Afghan King Ahmad Shah Abdali. Panipat is slated to release on Dec 6, 2019.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- youtube/relianceentertainment</i></p>
