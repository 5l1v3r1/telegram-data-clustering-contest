      <p>Despite enjoying a strong debut season with Los Blancos in the 2014/15 campaign, Rodriguez has endured a nightmare spell at the club after falling out of favour with manager Zinedine Zidane, which included a two-season loan spell at Bayern Munich. </p>
      <p>The Colombia international returned to the Santiago Bernabeu this season, but reportedly remains out of Zidane's plans for the team, which could force him to leave the club in the January transfer window.</p>

      <p>According to <i>El Desmarque</i>, Premier League giants Arsenal have offered the 28-year-old a route out and are planning to launch a £35 million (R660 million) offer in a bid to secure his services.</p>
      <p>The same report suggested that Rodriguez is reluctant to entertain an approach from the Gunners, however, as he prefers a move to Italy or France over the Premier League. </p>
