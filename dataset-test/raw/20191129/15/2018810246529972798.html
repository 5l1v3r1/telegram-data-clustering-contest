      <p>It's taken some time, but PSVR has finally matured into a nice spot. And if you're looking around for Christmas gifts, a PSVR bundle with <i>Resident Evil 7</i>, the superb <i>Astro Bot</i>, <i>Skyrim VR</i> and <i>Everybody's Golf VR</i>, then today's the day.</p>
      <p>Amazon are selling the <a href="https://amzn.to/34vq1NM">MegaPack bundle for $262.65</a> for today only, and it's the best way to get into PSVR. Extra bonus: Sony has already tacitly announced that the <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/07/ps5-sony-psvr-2-everything-we-know-so-far/">PS5 will support</a> the existing PSVR, but you'll obviously get the performance bump from the PS5's vastly better hardware.</p>
