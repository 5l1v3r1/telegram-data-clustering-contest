      <h1>Premier League chief executive David Pemsel resigns - before starting job</h1>
      <h2>David Pemsel was due to start as Premier League chief executive in February, taking over from Richard Scudamore after his resignation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:27:17+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>David Pemsel has resigned from his role as Premier League chief executive - before starting in the job.</p>
      <p>Pemsel was due to start in the role in February, succeeding long-term boss Richard Scudamore after his departure.</p>
      <p>He was the third person to be offered the job and the Premier League now faces a fresh search, 540 days after Scudamore first announced he was quitting.</p>
      <p>His resignation comes after allegations about his private life published in the press this week.</p>
      <p>A statement released by the Premier League read: "Following media disclosures earlier this week and discussions with David Pemsel, the Premier League has today accepted David’s resignation and he will no longer be joining as Chief Executive.</p>
      <p>"Richard Masters will continue as Interim Chief Executive.</p>
      <p>"No further comment will be made at this stage."</p>

      <p>Pensel had been serving his notice as chief executive of the Guardian Media Group.</p>
      <p>He has been credited with overseeing the media company turning a profit for the first time in 20 years, prompting him to land the Premier League job.</p>
      <p>Susanna Dinnage, president of Discovery's group Animal Planet, was first appointed CEO to succeed Scudamore but withdraw her acceptance of the role in December last year.</p>
      <p>The Premier League then approached BBC Studies' commercial division chief executive Tim Davie in January, but he rejected the job.</p>
      <p>Pensel's resignation means the league - the most lucrative sports competition in the world with a broadcast rights deal with £9.2billion for a three-year cycle - must now go back on the job hunt.</p>
