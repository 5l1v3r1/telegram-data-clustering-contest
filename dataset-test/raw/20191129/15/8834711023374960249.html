      <h1>OUTA: Endless SOE Bailouts Now Exceed Departments Budgets</h1>

      <p>The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) on Friday told Parliament that current interventions at state-owned entities (SOEs), like Eskom and South African Airways (SAA), were not working.</p>
      <p>Outa was making its submission during the public hearings on the 2019 Adjustments Appropriation Bill and the 2019 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement.</p>
      <p>The objective of the Bill was to effect adjustments to the appropriation of money from the National Revenue Fund for the requirements of the state in the current financial year.</p>
      <p>Outa said unprofitable SOEs, like SAA, needed to be overhauled and the government should wind down those that were beyond repair. The organisation’s Godfrey Gulston said endless bailouts had reached a point where they even exceed the budgets of entire departments.</p>
      <p>“In 2019/2022 Eskom alone far exceeded the entire budget of the Department of Defence. It is higher than the Department of Health’s budget for 2019/2020 and it’s more than double the Department of Basic Education’s budget.”</p>
      <p>Gulston added that the government also needed to have a serious discussion about the sale of non-core assets to plug the cash leaks, as well as “partial privatisation” of strategic SOEs.</p>
