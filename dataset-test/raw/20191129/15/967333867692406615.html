        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Israeli manufacturer Rafael faced a major setback in 2018 after the Indian Defence Ministry cancelled a $500 million Spike deal in favour of a domestically manufactured anti-tank guided missile. New Delhi previously bailed on a Spike purchase in 2011, and again in 2017 – both times under the DRDO’s pressure.</b>

      <p>India’s state-funded defence research agency launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defence Systems on Friday, ahead of a multi-billion deal to supply third generation anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) to the Indian Army.</p>
      <p>The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has claimed that the Israeli firm has been circulating “incorrect facts” regarding India’s ATGM.</p>

      <p>The tweet followed Rafael's statement: “With confidence in the Spike missile established, the Indian Army may need to revisit their plans” to develop an Indian anti-tank guided missile.</p>
      <p>The statement by the Israeli firm came on the same day when India's Army chief witnessed test firing of the Israeli<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201906251076048113-india-reportedly-drops-israeli-missile-deal-for-indigenously-made-replacement/"> Spike long-range ATGM</a> at an infantry school in Mhow, a cantonment in Madhya Pradesh state.</p>

      <p>Rafael claimed that it will take a long time for the DRDO develop an ATGM to reach the Indian Army in the field.</p>
      <p>“To overcome the critical capability void, the Indian Army procured a limited quantity of Spike LR missiles”, the Israeli firm said about a recent purchase of over 200 Spike missiles made under an emergency procurement in July.</p>
      <blockquote>“Both the DRDO ATGM program as well as the invitation to the industry to develop a third-generation missile will need a rethink, as having a fourth generation missile will put the plan for development of a third generation missile questionable”, the company argued.</blockquote>
      <p>The Indian Defence Ministry cancelled a planned $500 million purchase of Spike anti-tank missiles from Israel's Rafael in favour of the DRDO's man-portable anti-tank guided missiles in January 2018 - just days ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Delhi.</p>
      <p>The Indian Army says it requires at least 40,000 <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201907191076298423-india-to-produce-nag-third-generation-anti-tank-guided-missiles---defence-ministry-video/">anti-tank guided missiles</a> in the next two decades.</p>
