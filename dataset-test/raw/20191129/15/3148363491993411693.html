      <p>Friday on “Fox &amp; Friends,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) weighed in on the peace talks with the Taliban, which President Donald Trump revealed on Thursday have been resumed.</p>
      <p>Cotton said the Taliban needs to renounce violence, renounce its ties to Al-Qaeda and recognize the government in Kabul as part of its deal.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, we’re going to have to have the Taliban be a part of any ultimate political solution in Afghanistan, but we have to remember the Taliban has not renounced violence, it has not renounced its ties to Al-Qaeda or affiliated groups and it has not recognized the government in Kabul,” Cotton outlined. “If they are ready to take those kinds of steps and reach a ceasefire, then that’s something we can make progress on. If they just want to give illusory promise in return for concrete concessions, I don’t think that’s a foundation for a solid peace deal.”</p>
      <p>He added, “If they just want to make promises in return for concessions and American withdrawal, then we’re not going to have a long-lasting peace.”</p>
