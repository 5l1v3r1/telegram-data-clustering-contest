      <p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said he plans to spend part of 2020 living in Africa.</p>
      <p>Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1180191189590392832?s=20">spent November</a> visiting with entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa.</p>
      <p>“Sad to be leaving the continent…for now,” Dorsey tweeted Wednesday. “Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020.”</p>

      <p>Techpoint publisher Adewale Yusuf, who organized a meeting between Dorsey and tech publishers and entrepreneurs, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/29/tech/jack-dorsey-africa-future/index.html?utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_content=2019-11-29T11%3A20%3A05&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=link">told CNN</a> that he expects Dorsey to live in several African countries during his move abroad.</p>
      <p>"I don't think he will pick a specific country. He might shuttle between a few African countries. But I definitely think Nigeria will be one of the countries," he said.</p>
