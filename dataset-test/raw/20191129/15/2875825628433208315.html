      <h2>The trio will be fronting Premier Sport's coverage throughout December</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:00:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/donagh-corby/" target="_blank">Donagh Corby</a></address>
      <p>Former RTÉ panellists <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/eamon-dunphy">Eamon Dunphy</a>, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liam-brady">Liam Brady</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/john-giles">John Giles</a> will reunite for Premier League coverage, starting next week.</p>
      <p>The trio will be fronting Premier Sport's coverage throughout December, beginning on Tuesday evening for champions Manchester City’s visit to Burnley on Premier Sports 1.</p>
      <p>The coverage will involve a number of simulcasts with Second Captains’ Eoin McDevitt fronting a second panel comprising of Kenny Cunningham and Chris Sutton.</p>
      <p>Eamon Dunphy said "I'm delighted to be back with John and Liam, they're great lads. I'm a big fan of Ivan, he's a brilliant broadcaster.</p>
      <p>"He's also a Manchester City fan so we will have a good bit of craic with him if Burnley beat them on Tuesday."</p>
      <p>Premier Sports owner Michael O’Rourke added “Unlike the Premier League teams we’re getting our business done before January.</p>

      <p>"We’re delighted to reunite Ireland’s most beloved and iconic football panel. We’re very much looking forward to Eamonn, John and Liam bringing their unrivalled expertise and colour to our subscribers.</p>
      <p>“December will see Premier Sports coverage reach new heights and on St. Stephen's Day Premier Sports will be the go-to channel for football fans to watch all the action with four live games back to back and an additional five games available on Sky’s red button.”</p>
      <p>Newstalk’s <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ivan-yates">Ivan Yates</a> will act as the Bill O'Herlihy of the colourful panel as he makes his football coverage debut.</p>
      <p>It will be the first time since 2016 for the former Ireland internationals to share a screen following their exit from the national broadcaster after a combined 90 years of service.</p>
      <p>The iconic ex-pros will also be contributing to the station’s other flagship game on Wednesday night in the Merseyside derby between Everton and Liverpool.</p>
