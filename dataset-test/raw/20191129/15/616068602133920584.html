      <p>Bring a new or gently used book to the opening of the Global Child Literacy Centre tomorrow at Evangel Church in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>Okanagan College trades and apprenticeship students partnered with Niteo Africa Society and the CLAC to convert a shipping container into a model literacy centre similar to those that are shipped to Uganda by Niteo.</p>
      <p>The literacy centre will be permanently located at the Evangel parking lot on Gordon Drive and will act as an education centre as well as a permanent book collection station. </p>
      <p>“This project has been so great for us and our students,” says Teresa Kisilevich, Associate Dean of Trades and Apprenticeship. “We had carpentry students and staff build the windows, front entrance and roof. Our Women in Trades students built a book collection box, and students from School District 23’s Central School built bookshelves. As much as possible, we used recycled materials, making this a meaningful project on so many levels.”</p>
      <p>Books for toddlers to teens can be donated at any time, but you can bring some to Saturday's grand opening from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
