      <h1>We're excited for the 2020 Nissan Almera to arrive in PH</h1>
      <h2>Nissan brings a more stylish B-segment fighter with the 2020 Almera</h2>

      <p>We got our first look at the all-new Nissan Almera earlier this year when it debuted as the US-Spec <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/meet-the-radically-redesigned-2020-nissan-versa-almera.html">Versa</a>. Fast forward to November, and the sub-compact Nissan has finally been launched in the ASEAN market. Needless to say, it looks good even from the press photos. Better yet, it is an all-new model too.</p>

      <p>With the 2019 Thailand International Motor Expo now in full swing, we had to opportunity to get a closer look at the all-new Almera in the metal. While the Almera looks good in official press photos, the subcompact model looks even better in person. It’s miles away from the outgoing model and now looks like a smaller Sylphy and Altima. The new orange color certainly helps its appeal too.</p>

      <p>Going into the styling details, the front end now features Nissan’s signature V-Motion grill paired with slim, upswept headlights. Top-end variants are available with LED headlights as well. The roofline, meanwhile, is now more rakish and slopes towards the rear. Similar to its larger siblings, the taillights are now slim wraparound units. The kicked-up trunk lid gives it an integrated ducktail design.</p>

      <p>Inside, the cabin has also been given a huge upgrade. There’s a new dashboard with a two-tone design. Front and center is a large infotainment screen front and center. It comes with a 6-speaker sound system while higher-end variants will even get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Automatic climate control is also available on higher-end models.</p>

      <p>In Thailand, the Almera benefits from Nissan’s Intelligent Mobility safety suite. Yes, this is the same safety feature equipped in top-spec models of the Navarra and Terra locally. This means it comes with automatic emergency braking, front collision warning, and even 360-degree cameras. Stability control is also included in select variants. Hopefully, the Philippine-spec model will also get these features.</p>

      <p>Under the hood is a new 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine. Despite its small displacement, power is rated at 100 PS and torque is at 152 Nm. It then shifts via a continuously variable transmission. However, it is possible the 1.5-liter mill from the out-going model could be retained for the Philippine market.</p>

      <p>Now that it’s out in Thailand, it's only a matter of time before the Almera makes its way to the Philippines. Hopefully, we get to see it in the Philippines sometime next year.</p>
