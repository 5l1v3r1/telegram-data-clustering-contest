      <p>Dell is running its own Doorbusters deal for Black Friday where it is offering discounts of up to $300 on selected laptops.</p>
      <p>The new XPS 15 featuring a 9th gen. 6-core Core i7 processor, 15.6-inch FHD InfinityEdge display, 512GB M2 storage, 16GB RAM, and GTX1650 GPU is available for <b>$1,399</b> after a $300 discount. That's a pretty great deal on a pretty powerful laptop.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Dell Inspiron 15 5000</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you are on a budget, you really cannot go wrong with the Inspiron 15. It features Intel's 10th gen. Core i5 processor, 15.6-inch FHD display, 8GB RAM, and 256GB M2 SSD. If you don't have a particularly demanding workload and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket, the Inspiron 15 is going to more than suffice for you.</p>
      <p>For Black Friday, Dell is discounting the laptop by $250 which means you can get it for <b>$399.99</b>. You can also finance the laptop and pay for it monthly if you wish to.</p>

      <p>You really can't go wrong with a ThinkPad and for Black Friday, Lenovo is offering hefty discounts on selected models.</p>
      <p>You can get the slightly dated ThinkPad X1 Gen 7 featuring Intel's 8th gen. Core i5 processor, 14-inch IPS FHD LCD, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD for <b>$999</b> after a massive $1,000+ discount. Don't be fooled by that high discount though since this is an older model and it usually retails for a price that is far lower than its MSRP. Nonetheless, for $999, this laptop is definitely a steal.</p>
