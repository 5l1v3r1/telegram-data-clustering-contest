      <p>Before you head out the door to do some holiday shopping, there are three great apps and websites you should know about to save money and time.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.rakuten.com/">Rakuten</a></b><br/><br/>Rakuten is a Japanese company and a legitimate marketplace.<br/><br/>They bought Ebates, so everything you buy, you get a little cash back.<br/><br/>They pay out in PayPal or check.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://slickdeals.net/">Slickdeals</a></b><br/>Slickdeals is a crowd-sourced app where members themselves vote on what's a good deal.<br/><br/>Editors also pick the best deals they find.<br/><br/>In the last week, some of the big markdowns have been on T.V.'s, marked down as much as a thousand dollars.<br/><br/>You have to keep checking back on the site, their front page of deals is constantly changing.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://wikibuy.com/">Wikibuy</a></b><br/>Wikibuy is a plug-in you can download into the chrome browser.<br/><br/>It compares all prices all across the web, everywhere from Amazon to eBay.<br/><br/>You can find some items for up to $40 cheaper.<br/><br/>ABC13's Samica Knight's favorite of those three is Slick Deals because everyone adds in deals as they find them, making it a group effort to save money.</p>
