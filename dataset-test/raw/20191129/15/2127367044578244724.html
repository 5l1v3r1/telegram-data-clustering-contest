      <p>Steve Smith and Virat Kohli are constantly fighting it out for the top spot in the ICC Test rankings for batsmen. Smith, who made a dream comeback in the Test arena after serving his ball-tampering ban, currently holds the top spot in the rankings with 931 points. Virat Kohli, who brought up his 27th century in the longest format during India's maiden day-night Test against Bangladesh, came within three rating points of top-ranked Smith. However, it is someone else who is leading the Test run-scoring charts for the year now. Marnus Labuschagne, the first-ever concussion substitute in the history of Test cricket, brought up his 2nd century in the longest format against Pakistan on Friday, overtaking Smith as the leading run-scorer for the year.</p>

      <p>With 793 runs from nine matches, Labuschagne now sits at the top of the table, followed by Smith, who has 778 runs from six matches. </p>
      <p>Mayank Agarwal, who has had a dream home season, has 754 runs from eight matches.</p>
      <p>Ben Stokes is at number four with 746 runs, followed by Ajinkya Rahane with 642 runs.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, Virat Kohli occupies the 7th spot on the list with 612 runs from eight matches.</p>
      <p>As far as the match is concerned, <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/australia-vs-pakistan-wasim-akram-bashes-shaheen-afridi-for-fielding-howlers-against-australia-2140864">David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne</a> scored back-to-back centuries as Australia stamped their authority on the opening day of the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/australia-vs-pakistan-david-warner-joe-burns-play-rock-paper-scissors-before-batting-in-2nd-test-wat-2140528">day-night second Test in Adelaide</a> on Friday.  </p>
      <p>At the close on a rain-interrupted day, the home team were a dominant 302/1 with the pair building an ominous 294-run partnership, the highest ever in a day-night Test.</p>
      <p>Warner was not out 166 and Labuschagne unbeaten on 126.</p>
      <p>"It's a bit surreal at the moment. It was just amazing to be out there with Davey and to just put on a really big partnerhsip," Labuschagne said at the close of play.</p>
