      <h1>Giovani Lo Celso facing uncertain Tottenham Hotspur future under Jose Mourinho?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/giovani-lo-celso/"><b>Giovani Lo Celso</b></a>'s future at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> is reportedly in doubt following the arrival of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The Argentina international joined Spurs on loan from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/betis/"><b>Real Betis</b></a> during the summer, and the English club have the option to complete a permanent deal either in January or at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Estadio Deportivo</i>, the price for a January deal would be £27m plus bonuses or the capital side could pay £34m to secure his services this summer.</p>
      <p>However, the report claims that Mourinho's arrival has 'slowed' the full signing as the Portuguese is unsure where Lo Celso fits into his plans moving forward.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> was allegedly fully behind signing Lo Celso on a permanent transfer, although the South American's future in London is now slightly less clear due to the change in management.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been restricted to just six Premier League appearances this season due to a hip problem, while he is yet to feature since Mourinho arrived as head coach, remaining on the bench for the clashes with West Ham United and Olympiacos.</p>
