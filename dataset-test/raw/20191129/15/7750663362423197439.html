      <h1>Rice calls on Hamilton not to 'get a slap in the face' against Livingston</h1>

      <p>The 3-1 defeat at home to the Light Blues last Sunday,Â following two encouraging draws against Ross County and Kilmarnock, meant Accies have gone seven games without a win since beating Saturday's opponents in September.</p>
      <p>The Lanarkshire club have only won two league games this season and are above bottom side St Johnstone on goal difference having played a game more, but they were praised for the way they had a go at Steven Gerrard's side and the Hamilton boss wants more of the same against Livi.</p>
      <p>"I had to remind them that you get a pat on the back the one day, a slap in the face the next," said Rice.</p>
      <p>"So make sure it is not a slap in the face this weekend.</p>
      <p>"Every time you get a decent performance, maybe better than some people expected you to do, the hardest bit then is to carry it on.</p>
      <p>"A lot of time I have seen teams get a good performance against the Old Firm or a good result and they rest on their laurels for a few days and it affects their performance on the Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We can't have that. Our performances over the last three or four weeks have been really, really good.</p>
      <p>"So we need to carry that on, we need to build on that and going to Livingston is really difficult.</p>
      <p>"Their home record is fantastic. I have the utmost admiration for Livingston Football Club.</p>
      <p>"I am from that area and what they have achieved is fantastic with the same sort of budget I have got.</p>
      <p>"They have built up a reputation of being competitive, direct but people forget that they have some really good, talented football players. I don't ignore that.</p>
      <p>"I have seen Livingston often enough to know they are a very talented football team."</p>
