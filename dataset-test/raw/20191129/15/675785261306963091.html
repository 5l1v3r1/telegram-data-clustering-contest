      <h1>Man City manager Pep Guardiola reacts to Unai Emery sacking</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery was sacked as Arsenal manager on Friday morning after a run of seven matches without a win - Man City face the Gunners in the Premier League next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:21:46+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has backed Unai Emery to return to management quickly following his sacking by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>Emery was sacked as Gunners boss after 18 months in charge, following a run of seven games without a win.</p>
      <p>But Guardiola, who came up against Emery in La Liga Spain and the Premier League, backed the 48-year-old, despite Arsenal's decision to jettison him.</p>
      <p>“I’m so sorry for him,” said Guardiola. “Every time a manager is sacked it’s not good news, honestly.</p>
      <p>“But it doesn’t change my opinion about his capacity. He’s an incredible professional, he did incredibly well in Spain.</p>

      <p>“He won three Europa Leagues in a row with Sevilla, one of the most incredible achievements. I know and he knows it’s [down to] results.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola takes his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> side to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> tomorrow, knowing a win can cut Liverpool's lead at the top to six points before Jurgen Klopp's side host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>City lost at St James' Park last January, before going on a 14-game winning run to pip <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> to the title by a single point.</p>

      <p>“It was a bit turbulent in the beginning of the season [for Newcastle],” said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>“I think they’re a team who can stay in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“They’re so strong and fast in front with Joelinton.</p>
      <p>“We knew him from last season with Hoffenheim. Their structure is similar to Rafa Benitez.”</p>
      <p>On City's defeat to Newcastle Guardiola said: “It’s forgotten. We played slow, didn’t attack. We forgot to attack. But it was nearly 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>“We’ve learned from that and spoke about it. We had a bad afternoon. It wasn’t the way we are. We have to be ourselves.</p>
      <p>“Newcastle made a good defensive performance, had two shots on target and we didn’t play like we could.</p>
      <p>“We tried to be who we are from the next game. At that moment, I didn’t think we’d win the Premier League and 14 games in a row.”</p>
