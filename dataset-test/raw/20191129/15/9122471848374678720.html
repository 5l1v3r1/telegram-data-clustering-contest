      <h1>Injury Update For Georgia WR Lawrence Cager</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:05:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Georgia didn’t get the best possible news for its College Football Playoff aspirations on Thursday. Per a new update, top wide receiver Lawrence Cager will be out for the stretch run.</p>
      <p>Cager, who spent his first three college seasons at Miami before taking a graduate transfer to UGA, has 33 catches for 476 yards and four touchdowns this season. He’s dealt with some injury issues throughout though, and has missed multiple games for the Dawgs.</p>
      <p>Now, he could be out for Saturday’s rivalry game against Georgia Tech, and potentially the SEC Championship against LSU, at a minimum. Cager <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/lawrence-cager-georgia-injured-ankle-practice">suffered an ankle injury during the team’s practice</a> on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28182073/sources-georgia-wr-lawrence-cager-ankle-miss-several-weeks">ESPN</a>‘s Mark Schlabach.</p>
      <p>As he notes, this isn’t great news for quarterback Jake Fromm, who has relied on Cager as his most consistent target, and has struggled without him in spots.</p>
      <blockquote>Cager missed the Bulldogs’ 19-13 win over Texas A&amp;M last week because of shoulder and rib injuries. He also played sparingly in wins over Kentucky in Week 8 and Auburn in Week 12.<br/><br/>A 6-foot-5 native of Baltimore, Cager had emerged as quarterback Jake Fromm’s favorite target when he was on the field. Cager had seven catches for 132 yards with one touchdown in a 24-17 victory over Florida on Nov. 2.<br/><br/>With Cager sidelined because of injuries, Fromm completed only 11 of 23 passes for 163 yards with one touchdown against the Aggies, his third straight game in which he completed fewer than 50 percent of his pass attempts.</blockquote>
      <p>Georgia is as talented as anyone, especially on defense, but the offense can really struggle at points. Without Lawrence Cager, the program should be okay against the Yellow Jackets, but outscoring a dynamic LSU offense could be a struggle.</p>
