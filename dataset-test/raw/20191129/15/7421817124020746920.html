        <b>Libreville</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oil-rich Gabon has detained eight people for theft and money-laundering as the government intensifies a crackdown on corruption, the prosecutor for the capital Libreville said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The revived anti-graft drive has seen a string of top-level arrests in the central African country, as accusations that millions of euros have disappeared from state coffers swirl around top officials.</p>
      <p>"Eight people have been placed in preventive detention," said prosecutor Andre Patrick Roponat, adding that they were accused of "siphoning off public funds and money-laundering."</p>
      <p>The group appeared before a judge on Wednesday along with eight others who were released on bail, Roponat said.</p>
      <p>Pro-government newspaper L'Union reported this week that more than 85 billion CFA francs (Sh14.6 billion) have "evaporated" over the past two years from the funds of the Gabon Oil Company.</p>

        <b>BONGO CORRUPTION PURGE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The current investigations are a follow-up to Operation Mamba -- an anti-corruption campaign launched in 2017 by President Ali Bongo, who has been battling serious illness.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old president said last month he was "fiercely determined" to push ahead with the campaign against graft.</p>
      <p>One high-profile political figure embroiled in the affair is Brice Laccruche Alihanga, Bongo's former cabinet director who took the lead and spoke for the president after he suffered a stroke in 2018.</p>
      <p>Laccuruche had held his cabinet post for more than two years but was dismissed on November 7 -- at the start of a wave of arrests.</p>
      <p>He has announced on social media that he will undertake a new mission for "the president and for Gabon".</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, lawyers told AFP that presidential spokesman Ike Ngouoni and a dozen others were arrested and questioned over their ties to Alihanga.</p>
      <p>During his months-long absence abroad for treatment, speculation over Bongo's fitness surged and the army quashed a brief attempted coup.</p>
      <p>Bongo has ruled Gabon since 2009, following the death of his father Omar Bongo, who was in power from 1967.</p>
