      <p>Hungarian artist <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/gergely-dudas">Gergely Dudás</a> creates mind-boggling brainteasers, often containing hidden objects or details, and challenges the internet to find them. In past drawings, he’s hidden a <a href="https://www.insider.com/viral-brainteaser-gergely-dudas-mouse-mushrooms-2019-10">mouse among mushrooms</a>, a <a href="https://www.insider.com/brainteaser-gergely-dudas-dudolf-penguin-toucans-2019-7">penguin among toucans</a>, and a <a href="https://www.insider.com/valentines-day-brainteaser-heart-flowers-2019-2">heart among flowers</a>.</p>
      <p>He’s also released three books of brainteasers: one of holiday puzzles called <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062570789/bears-merry-book-of-hidden-things">“Bear’s Merry Book of Hidden Things,”</a> a Halloween-themed book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bears-Spooky-Hidden-Things-Seek/dp/006257079X?tag=insider-safetynet-20">“Bear’s Spooky Book of Hidden Things,”</a> and his latest, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bears-Springtime-Book-Hidden-Things/dp/0062570803?keywords=gergely+dudas&amp;amp;qid=1547303879&amp;amp;sr=8-3-fkmrnull&amp;amp;ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_3&amp;amp;tag=insider-safetynet-20">“Bear’s Springtime Book of Hidden Things.”</a></p>
      <p>In his latest illustration, Dudás drew 12 pairs of rabbits with matching patterns on their ears, faces, and bellies – but one rabbit doesn’t have a twin. Can you find the odd one out?</p>
