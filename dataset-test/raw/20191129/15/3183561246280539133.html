      <p>Apple just released its brand new <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/apples-airpods-pro-vs-apple-airpods-australia/">AirPods Pro</a>, which means this Black Friday you can pick up the regular second gen AirPods (which are still excellent) at a bargain.</p>
      <p>But you gotta be quick.</p>

      <p>eBay is going to be <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/123932436002">offering the AirPods for just $99</a>, but the sale won't kick off until <b>6pm AEDT</b>.</p>
      <p>The online retailer had the same deal going earlier twice already today and they sold out fast, so you're going to want to set a reminder for <b>6pm</b>.</p>
      <p>The 2nd gen AirPods has 5 hours of charge and was the first iteration of the earbuds to have Apple's fancy H1 chip.</p>
      <p>As an added bonus, the AirPods come with a wireless charging case, which I can attest to being real good.</p>
