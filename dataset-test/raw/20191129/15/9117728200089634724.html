      <h1>Bottas and Grosjean summoned to the stewards after FP2 crash</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/romain-grosjean">Romain Grosjean</a> have been summoned to the stewards following their bizarre crash during FP2 of the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/abu-dhabi-grand-prix">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> weekend. </b>
      </p>
      <p>With 20 minutes of the second session, the weekend remaining Bottas sent a move up the inside of turn 11 expecting Grosjean to give him a bit more room to let him by. However, the Frenchman turned in on Bottas, the pair collided and the session was red-flagged.</p>
      <p>Both drivers returned to the garage where Grosjean had considerable damage to his floor which prevented him from returning to the session. Bottas also had damage to his front wing but was able to return to see out the remaining few minutes of the session. </p>
      <p>Both drivers put the blame on the other person, with Grosjean sounding very frustrated. Grosjean said over the radio: <i>“What the f*** was that?</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Where did he come from? Yeah, I think it’s floor and everything. Mate, he was miles away.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Check the car, if we can go again we go again, but I’m worried it’s no good.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>They will now see the stewards at 19:00 local time. </p>
