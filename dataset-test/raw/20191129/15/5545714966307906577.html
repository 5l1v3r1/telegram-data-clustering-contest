      <p>Activision and Infinity Ward have started laying out plans for <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's</i> Season One content. Beginning on December 3, the publisher notes that the DLC drop will be "the biggest free content drop in <i>Call of Duty</i> history."<br/><br/>New maps will be arriving in multiple modes, with Crash, Vacant, and Shipment coming to standard Multiplayer, Port headed to Ground War, and Cargo and Atrium arriving in <i>Modern Warfare's</i> new mode Gunfight. Speaking of which, Gunfight itself is getting new mode "On-Site Procurement" which, as the name suggests, will require players to find their own weapons dotted around the play area before engaging in combat.</p>

      <p>Those of you who prefer standard multiplayer should keep an eye out for new modes such as the single-life, flag-capturing Reinforce and the new "party survival" mode Infected. A selection of new missions will also be rolled out in the challenging co-op mode, Spec Ops. Finally, two new rifles are joining the <i>COD: MW</i> arsenal: The RAM-7 and the Holger-26. So perhaps you can finally put away that sniper shotgun.<br/><br/><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i> is available now on PS4, PC and Xbox One.</p>
