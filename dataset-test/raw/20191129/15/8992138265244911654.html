      <p>Crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase said the rumours of acquiring US-based prime broker <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/tagomi-co-founder-big-tech-will-bring-institutionals-to-crypto/">Tagomi</a> are unfounded and baseless. Coinbase VP of communications Rachael Horwitz denied media reports that his firm bought <u>Tagomi</u>, which specializes in trade execution and digital asset markets, for $150 million.</p>

      <p>Tagomi was co-founded by former HFT technologists including Greg Tusar, global head of electronic trading at Goldman Sachs and Jennifer Campbell from Union Square Ventures. It recently raised $28 million from Peter Thiel’s Founder Fund and Paradigm as well as others.</p>
      <p>Tagomi operates as <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/tagomi-receives-bitlicense-to-operate-in-new-york/">a prime broker in the crypto space</a>, aggregating liquidity across multiple exchanges and executing trades based on a single unified order book.

      </p>
      <p>As titans of U.S. cryptocurrency industry were in a race to establish regulated exchanges for tokens deemed to be securities, Coinbase has bought two brokers including a broker-dealer registered with the Wall Street’s independent watchdog, the FINRA.</p>
      <p>In 2018,the San Francisco-based company has <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/coinbase-continues-acquisition-spree-paradex-buyout/">acquired</a> Keystone Capital Corp in a bid to operate as a regulated broker-dealer. It has also acquired Venovate Marketplace Inc. and Digital Wealth LLC. The acquired businesses offer Coinbase a broker-dealer license (B-D), an alternative trading system license (ATS), and a registered investment advisor (RIA) license.</p>
      <p>The move comes as the US Securities and Exchange ‎Commission is seeking legitimate platforms serving as trading venues ‎for digital assets. This topic has received much attention since the SEC ‎made clear that any digital token with an income stream is ‎a security, and furthermore that ‎any entity wants to ‎become an ATS needs to register with the SEC as a ‎broker-dealer and become a member of a self-regulating ‎organization, such as the ‎FINRA.‎</p>
