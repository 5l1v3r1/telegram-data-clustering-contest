      <h1>Color Blind? This free Chrome plugin may help</h1>

      <p>Around 10% of men are color blind to some degree, which can make it difficult to read charts for example, such as this one regarding Cybertruck interest levels.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, on computers we have full control over the presentation of colors, which means there are various ways of addressing the issue.</p>
      <p>On Windows 10 there is a convenient color filter option in settings (Under Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Color filters) which lets you adjust the filters to increase the contrast between different colors.  (Read more <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/if-you-dont-see-all-the-numbers-heres-how-to-switch-on-windows-10s-secret-colorblind-mode/">here</a>)</p>
      <p>If you are unable to change the settings on your PC or prefer not to change the presentation of colors on your whole PC, there is a free Google Chrome plugin (which will presumably also work on the new Edge) which will help you adjust color settings just for your browser.</p>
      <p>The Dalton color blind chrome plugin provides a solution for people with various types of colour deficiency including those affected by Tritanopia (blue colour vision deficiency), Deuteranopia (green), Protanopia (red).  You can also do an online self-test at <a href="https://enchroma.com/pages/color-blindness-test">enchroma.com here.</a></p>
      <p>The plugin includes a convenient settings panel which allows you to determine which kind of color blindness you have and adjust the settings to best address it.</p>

      <p>It can also be toggled on and off easily.</p>
