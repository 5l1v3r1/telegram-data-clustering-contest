      <p>Cheryl Hole, the fabulous Essex-based drag queen from RuPaul's Drag Race UK, takes on the role of a fairy 'Giftmother' in Virgin Media's new campaign to give away a fucktonne of stuff before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Slightly cringily called <i>Now That’s Christmas-ing</i>, the campaign is a sort of advent calendar of prizes, with daily prizes from the 1st to the 25th of December.</p>
      <p>The 25 days of prizes are on offer for all customers of both Virgin Media and Virgin Mobile, and start this Sunday (which incredibly is somehow December).</p>
      <p>Here's sparkly Cheryl to explain more, alright babes?</p>

      <p>Prizes in the giveaway include two tickets to a Virgin Voyages cruise, cases of Virgin Wines for a year, and a stay in Richard Branson's lodge. Yes, all the prizes relate to the Virgin brand in some way.</p>
      <p>The excellently-named Cilesta Van Doorn, Director of Brand and Marketing at Virgin Media, comments:</p>
      <blockquote>"Christmas is all about giving, so we wanted to give back to our customers and show then the love they deserve: unlimited love. By working with the whole Virgin family, I believe we’ve managed to give our customers a truly unique experience unlike any other. We wish our customers the best of luck as they attempt to get their hands on a range of goodies."</blockquote>
      <p>On Christmas Day itself, one lucky git will land ALL of the prizes from every day of December.</p>
      <p>If you're on Virgin Mobile or Virgin Media, you'll get a daily email reminding you to enter that day's competition. If you win the whole lot, share it with your pals at Giz UK, yeah babes? Fanks.</p>
