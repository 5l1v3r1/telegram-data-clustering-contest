      <h1>The Alfredo Morelos fear beneath Rangers' rivals transfer jibes - Ibrox blogger</h1>
      <h2>The striker continued his incredible form against Feyenoord and our blogger Jamie Currie credits Dave King for splashing out in 2017.</h2>

      <p>Dave King stepping down in the New Year has had the recent headlines.</p>
      <p>And I would suggest that if he hadn't gone to the lengths he did to gain control from the Mike Ashley board, then Rangers would not be on the cusp of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> last 32 but more likely they would still be stuck in the Scottish Championship so for that alone, he deserves an immense amount of gratitude from the fanbase.</p>
      <p>But the way he’s helped take <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> from where he inherited them to where they are now has been remarkable.</p>
      <p>King is not everyone's cup of tea, but he certainly deserves his fair share of credit along with the investors who have helped assemble this squad. They look to be bringing a 'normal' feeling in and around the Rangers support with the recent results they have achieved.</p>
      <p>But for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-king">King</a> the years as chairman have not been perfect – there have been plenty of mistakes.</p>
      <p>However, the £1million he shelled out to HJK Helsinki in the summer of 2017 to bring <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> to Ibrox must be the best money the man has spent. There is no way King will spend £1million better in his lifetime.</p>

      <p>King said he didn't expect Morelos to be sold in January even if Rangers were offered an obscene amount of money. Gerrard then suggested he wouldn't sell him for £50million. Both were roundly mocked by those love to have a dig at Rangers because they get some sort of irrational kick out of it.</p>
      <p>I mean, why would anyone part with that kind of money for a striker who doesn't score in big games? Yet the same man that this accusation is levelled at has just broken Henrik Larsson's record for the most goals scored by a Scottish club's striker in a European season – he now has 13 in 13. Two against Feyenoord and Porto, one against Young Boys and the winner that got Rangers to the group stage against Legia Warsaw.</p>
      <p>In fairness, It has been quite the road to redemption for Morelos. Last March when he was sent off at Parkhead many fans were done with him. But this season, the penny has dropped even last night – one booking away from a suspension – he kept his head down even when it wasn't going his way in the first half. Then, low and behold 'Buff' did what he does, pull Rangers out a massive hole with two outstanding headed goals in the second period - headers that the likes of Mark Hateley would have been proud of. But the fact he is able to do step up with big goals and big moments in European games shows that he is becoming a leader for this Rangers side.</p>

      <p>His turnaround with regards his discipline and the upward trajectory his form and ability has taken is great credit to the coaching staff, but Morelos has to take credit for his renaissance because if he had taken the huff in the summer and thrown his toys out of the pram, we would not be witnessing the standout performances we have this season, especially last night's in such an intimidating atmosphere. That's just the player he has become. He loves the big occasion and seems to thrive in it and that, of course, gives the team a massive boost to know they have a guy they can hang their hat on to grab them a goal at any given moment.</p>
      <p>Let's not forget he has currently netted 24 competitive club goals and we are not at the end of the year. He will be and should be gunning for Marco Negri's record from 1997/98 – 33 in all competitions before January 1 1998 – if he continues at this scoring rate, he will not only match it, I would back him to beat it.</p>
      <p>For him to beat that record, he's going to have to bang them in during the tough December period, which will hopefully bring Rangers the Betfred Cup as well them being at the summit of the league by the end of said month.</p>
      <p>If we are being honest, selling him would end any hope of sustaining a title challenge. Thankfully, the manager has said he's going nowhere, which was music to the collective ears of the Rangers support. He's been sneered at, mocked and mainly disliked – by non-Rangers people – so far during his time in Scotland, but now he's having the last laugh and those who are silly enough to continually write him off will always find ways to try and dismiss his ability and his goalscoring exploits but that derision is accompanied by a tinge of fear over how good a player Morelos has become.</p>
      <p>Forget about the talk of £40milllion and £50milillion valuations at the moment; Morelos is simply priceless to Rangers at this point in time. Furthermore, we have to enjoy him while he's still here and cherish what he brings to this Rangers side. At 23, he's well on the way to becoming the complete striker and that £1million outlay looks by each passing game to be the bargain of the decade and by far the best signing of Dave King's time in the chairman's seat.</p>
