        <li>Unequal recovery from the financial crisis may be behind increased hostility towards billionaires, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-18/wealth-tax-isn-t-the-answer-to-america-s-class-resentment">Bloomberg columnist Noah Smith wrote in a column</a>.</li>

      <p>A wealth tax could have cut <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/net-worth-americas-wealthiest-people-wealth-tax-jeff-bezos-2019-9">Jeff Bezos’ fortune in half and made Bill Gates $61 billion less rich</a>, but it might not do anything to make the economy feel more fair to the middle class, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-18/wealth-tax-isn-t-the-answer-to-america-s-class-resentment">Bloomberg columnist Noah Smith argued in a recent column</a>.</p>
      <p>The difficulty of recovering from a financial setback or meeting your financial goals after an unplanned expense has a lot to do with that sense of fairness, according to Smith. And what’s more, unequal recovery from financial crises may increase hostility towards billionaires, Smith argued. Ultra-wealthy people do tend to lose more money in turbulent markets than millionaires, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-vs-millionaires-investment-choices-lost-money-market-volatility-2019-7">Business Insider</a> previously reported – but they also recover faster and more fully than their less-wealthy counterparts, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-18/wealth-tax-isn-t-the-answer-to-america-s-class-resentment">Bloomberg analysis</a> of Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis data found.</p>
      <p>In part, that difference in bounce-back can be traced to where the upper and middle class, respectively, invest their money. Ultra-wealthy people tend to hold much of their net worth in the stock market, which has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/04/the-10th-anniversary-of-the-climactic-march-2009-market-bottom-arrives-this-week.html">delivered a 17.8% annualized return since March 2009</a>. The values of the homes that often comprise a substantial portion of the middle class’ net worth, however, have only <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-21/housing-is-back-but-the-american-dream-isn-t">partially recovered</a> in the years since the financial crisis.</p>
      <p>“This asymmetry might lead some people to wonder if American capitalism is rigged,” Smith wrote. “Psychologists often find that people are willing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/may/04/science-inequality-why-people-prefer-unequal-societies">to tolerate</a> inequality as long as they perceive the system as fair; it’s unfairness combined with inequality that inspires rage.”</p>
      <h3>Presidential candidate and Massachusetts <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-elizabeth-warren-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Sen. Elizabeth Warren</a> has been outspoken about her dislike of America’s wealthiest people</h3>
      <p>Arguably the most frequently discussed part of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential candidacy platform is her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-tax-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-difference-explained-chart-2019-10">wealth tax proposal.</a> A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/wealth-tax">wealth tax</a>, like the one proposed by presidential candidate Warren, would make ultra-wealthy Americans pay the federal government a small percentage of their net worth each year.</p>
      <p>She’s not the only presidential candidate behind the idea: In September, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-tax-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-difference-explained-chart-2019-10">Bernie Sanders unveiled an even more aggressive wealth tax plan</a>. And that concept isn’t supported only by those with an ax to grind with the ultra-wealthy. Billionaires and multimillionaires like Mark Cuban, Marc Benioff, Ray Dalio, and Abigail Disney have also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-asking-for-wealth-tax-americans-disney-soros-buffett-dalio">publicly asked the government to raise their taxes</a>.</p>
      <p>Warren also sells <a href="https://shop.elizabethwarren.com/products/billionaire-tears-mug">“billionaire tears” mugs</a> and hosts a <a href="http://wnsp.com/wordpress/bill-gates-5-secrets-to-happiness-are-surprisingly-affordable-forbes/">wealth tax calculator</a> with thinly veiled swipes at Bill Gates and Leon Cooperman on her campaign website. And her tough rhetoric has instilled <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-novogratz-billionaires-feel-like-victims-wealth-tax-elizabeth-warren-2019-10">fear</a> in many billionaires, former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-18/novogratz-says-wealthy-worried-about-warren-should-lighten-up">Bloomberg.</a></p>
      <p>“Ninety-seven percent of the people I know in my world are really, really fearful of her,” Novogratz said. “They don’t like her, they’re worried about her, they think she’s anti-rich … It’s a little carried away.”</p>
      <p>While the idea of using a wealth tax to solve America’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/united-states-racial-wealth-gap-cost-economy-2019-8">inequality problem</a> has gained traction in recent years, proposals have been hampered by questions over the effectiveness and the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-tax-definition-explained-elizabeth-warren-2019-7">constitutionality of such a tax</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s no denying that these calls for a tax on the ultra-wealthy come as the divide between America’s rich and poor continues to expand. In 2018, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/income-inequality-reached-highest-level-ever-recorded-in-2018-2019-9-1028559996">income inequality in the US</a> reached its highest level in more than half a century. The ultra-wealthy actually <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/american-billionaires-paid-less-taxes-than-working-class-wealth-gap-2019-10">paid a smaller portion of their income</a> in taxes than average Americans in 2018, an analysis of tax data by the University of California at Berkeley’s Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman found.</p>
      <p>Proponents of a wealth tax say the measure could reduce inequality by funding education reform, health care, and infrastructure reforms, but experts told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-tax-definition-explained-elizabeth-warren-2019-7">Business Insider</a> in September that enforcement issues and constitutional challenges make the chances of implementing such a tax before 2025 essentially zero. And, as Smith argued, the attention may be better applied elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“Instead, policy makers who want to avoid destructive class conflicts should focus on reducing the risks faced by the middle class,” Smith wrote. “If a middle-class lifestyle is less likely to end in tears, the clamor for billionaire tears might subside.”</p>
