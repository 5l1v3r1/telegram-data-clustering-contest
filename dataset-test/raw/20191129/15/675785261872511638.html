      <h2>WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Millions have seen the 23-year-old's footage after recording the bedroom attack when a family argument turned violent in Cangzhou, north China</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:39:55+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, John Feng, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>A young woman shared this harrowing video showing her abusive father charging into her bedroom and attacking her and her mother with a hammer.</p>
      <p>The incident took place in her family home in Cangzhou, China, and was posted online by the 23-year-old, known only by her surnamed Zhao.</p>
      <p>She was feeding her child in her bedroom when she heard her parents - both 52 years old - quarrelling outside over firewood for their fireplace, she wrote.</p>
      <p>The argument escalated and turned physical, with both mother and daughter locking themselves inside the bedroom.</p>
      <p>Ms Zhao films on her mobile phone as her dad bursts through the bedroom door holding a hammer in his right hand.</p>
      <p>Her phone is knocked out of her hand as the trio tussle and each tries to grab hold of the weapon, the video shows.</p>

      <p>In the distressing footage, Ms Zhao’s father can be seen stomping on her mobile phone in an apparent attempt to break it, but the video keeps rolling.</p>
      <p>The clip ends with her father apparently spitting at them as an infant is heard crying in the background.</p>
      <p>Ms Zhao, mother to a newborn, detailed the violent domestic in a post which has been widely shared.</p>
      <p>The shocking clip has been viewed more than five million times online.</p>
      <p>In her post, the young mum said her parents have been married for 26 years, and claimed similar violent scenes have become a constant theme.</p>

      <p>She wrote: “I threatened to call the police to have him arrested, he said ‘go on!’</p>
      <p>“He pushed me, but my mum stopped him, and we closed the door. I took my phone out and started recording as he came in holding a hammer.</p>
      <p>“My mum and I both grabbed his arm, then he knocked my phone away and tried to break it in order to destroy the evidence.</p>
      <p>“That’s what you see in the video. The police came and tried to mediate the situation by making him apologise, but he refused. Then they left. Nothing was solved.”</p>
      <p>Ms Zhao said she had repeatedly asked her mum to get a divorce in the past, but she did not wish to.</p>
      <p>She explained: “People will say she should just get a divorce, but it’s not that simple.</p>
      <p>“We live in a village, and my grandad needs taking care of. If she leaves, who looks after him?</p>
      <p> “I’m worried that one day he will kill her. What do I do?”</p>
      <p>Cangzhou City police told local media they were still investigating Ms Zhao’s case, but no arrests have been made.</p>
