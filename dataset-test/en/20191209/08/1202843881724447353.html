      <h1>Celebrate a perfect Nordic coffee moment with Nespresso this festive season</h1>

      <p>This holiday season, Nespresso has designed its iconic end of year range around indulgent Nordic moments. Incorporating the growing Scandinavian-inspired cultural trends of Hygge and Fika, Nespresso is encouraging its customers to put the busy festive season on pause, for a moment’s connection with a friend or family member.</p>
      <p>In partnership with renowned Danish designer, Louise Campbell, Nespresso has launched a range of Limited Edition Original and Vertuo coffees and accessories, which take design and flavour inspiration from the Nordic countries.</p>
      <p> Available to purchase from November 2019 are four unique, indulgent flavoured coffees, two black coffees and a range of limited edition accessories, designed with the most discerning of coffee and design aficionados in mind.</p>
      <p>As part of Nespresso Original, the Nordic-inspired Limited Edition includes two new indulgent flavoured coffees: Variations Nordic Almond Cake Flavoured and Variations Nordic Cloudberry Flavoured. Based on traditional Nordic ingredients and influences, the Variations Nordic Almond Cake Flavoured coffee features a combination of biscuit and vanilla aromas, with a Livanto base, inspired by the traditional Norwegian cake, Kvæfjordkake.</p>
      <p>Louise Campbell said: “I was thrilled to bits when I heard that my proposal for making the capsules even more precious than they already are by varying the designs was accepted, making each of them as fascinating as pebbles on a beach and as irresistible to collect. I took this idea of variation with me through the rest of the campaign.”</p>
