      <h1>Jose Mourinho reveals why he took the match ball off Son Heung-min</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:55:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author">Metro Sport Reporter</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has revealed that he took the match ball off Son Heung-min after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>’s win over Burnley because he wanted to reward Troy Parrott for making his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> debut.</p>
      <p>Son scored one of the goals of the season as Spurs bounced back from their midweek defeat to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> with a 5-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But after the match, Mourinho went across to Son and asked the South Korea international to hand him the match ball.</p>
      <p>Mourinho then went to hand it over to Parrott, who was brought on with five minutes remaining to make his Premier League debut.</p>

      <p>‘It was his debut and I think it had a much bigger meaning to a kid who last week was playing against kids in the Champions League,’ said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘Today he’s playing in the Premier League at 17.</p>
      <p>Will he play against Bayern Munich? I don’t know.</p>
      <p>‘All I can say is Harry Kane won’t. Who plays, we’ll see.’</p>
      <p>Tottenham travel to face Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday evening but the German side are five points clear at the top of Group B, meaning Spurs are guaranteed to finish second even if they win.</p>
