      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:20:47+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:20</time> by <a rel="author">Indo-Asian News Service</a></address>
      <p>Former Australia skipper Ian Chappell believes <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/cricket-australia-eyeing-2-day-night-tests-against-india-in-2021-report-2144327">Cricket Australia's plan of playing two Day/Night Tests against India in 2020-21</a> "may backfire" considering the fact that the Virat Kohli's team have a strong bowling attack. In a column for ESPNcricinfo, Chappell said: "Cricket Australia is contemplating two day-night Tests for the 2020-21 Indian tour." "However, if that ploy is meant to advantage Australia, it may backfire as India have a strong attack and <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/virat-kohli-takes-stunning-catch-to-dismiss-shimron-hetmyer-watch-2145476">(Virat) Kohli</a> has already shown he's adept at captaincy in this part of the world," he added.</p>
      <p>According to a report in ESPNcricinfo, when Australia visit India next year for a limited-overs series in January, a Cricket Australia (CA) delegation, led by its chairman Earl Eddings, is set to meet the new BCCI administration with the question of day-night Tests on the agenda.</p>
      <p>"Pleasingly they've played their first day-night Test and won easily. Now they've got through that it might give them the right build-up to it over here. I've got no doubt they'll consider playing one and maybe even more day-night Test matches. But that's down the track to when we catch up with them in January," Eddings said.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/sourav-ganguly-denies-possibility-of-two-day-night-tests-against-australia-in-2021-2144467">BCCI President Sourav Ganguly doesn't seem too keen on the idea</a>.</p>
      <p>"I have not heard anything officially from Cricket Australia. Two out of four will be a bit too much...it can't replace traditional Test matches. But we can have one Pink Test every series," Ganguly had said.</p>
      <p>India last month played their <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/day-night-test-india-make-pink-ball-test-debut-as-landmark-match-gets-underway-at-eden-gardens-2136806">first-ever pink-ball Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata</a> where they clinched an emphatic victory over Bangladesh. After that Test, captain Kohli was asked about the prospect of playing a Day/Night Test during the Australia tour next year and he said he was "open to do anything" as long as there was a practice match under lights.</p>
