      <p>Acting deputy chief James Wileman said results from two recent surveys into morale among employees were ‘pretty damning’ and he has made it one of his top five priorities to improve wellbeing within the force.</p>
      <p>A survey of officers and staff last year found that 64% would not recommend joining the force.</p>
      <p>The situation has improved slightly, with a report released this year finding that morale ratings of good or very good were given by 57% of respondents – up from 24%.</p>
      <p>Mr Wileman said the force had created a new role of head of learning and development to improve ‘career planning, talent spotting, succession planning and navigation’.</p>
      <p>He added that wellbeing events had also been made available to staff, which included health checks, and workshops on how best to wear body armour.</p>
      <p>‘We have to look after our staff and my position on that is clear. One of our main priorities has to be the wellbeing of our staff and the logic is simple; if we look after our officers and staff then they are more likely to serve the public better,’ said Mr Wileman.</p>
      <p>A recent Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services report found that morale among the force was lower than the rest of government and far lower than UK public services. They carried out their inspection in late 2018 and early 2019.</p>
      <p>HMIC acknowledged recent efforts to improve the physical wellbeing of officers and staff including ‘flu jabs, body armour fitting sessions and yoga classes’.</p>
      <p>The report also recognised that, in the spring and autumn of 2018, a series of lunchtime wellbeing sessions were put on covering areas such as posture, holistic therapies and ‘knowing your body’.</p>
      <p>The report added: ‘They were well received and well attended, despite not being advertised widely and being held at times when it was difficult for frontline officers to attend.’</p>
