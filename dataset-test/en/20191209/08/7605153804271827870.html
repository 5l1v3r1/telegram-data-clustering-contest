        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec 9- The death toll from the building that collapsed in Tassia Estate in Embakasi Constituency has risen to 10 after more bodies were recovered on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo, the four bodies include two children and a male adult.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>A multi-agency rescue team comprising the Kenya Defence Forces, the National Disaster Management Unit and the Kenya Red Cross, continues to sift through the layers of concrete slab and shells of the building stacked on each other in a search and rescue mission.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, two people were pulled out of the rubble alive.</p>
      <p>The Kenya Red Cross on Sunday said seven people remain unaccounted for and are feared to be still trapped in the rubble of the six-storey building that collapsed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The National Disaster Management Unit and the Kenya Red Cross have since set up a command post and tent to manage rescue and help.</p>
      <p>Experts have also been camping at the scene, conducting investigations on the cause of the tragedy or if it is linked to the ongoing rains.</p>
      <p>The structure is reported to have had 57 rental units, but not all of them were occupied at the time of the incident.</p>
      <p>Police have said they are looking for the building owner and a caretaker for questioning.</p>
