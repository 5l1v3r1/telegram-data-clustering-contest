      <p>Gametime took a downturn this week for <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s borrowed Reds, as only six loanees featured.</p>
      <p>Despite that limited match action there was no shortage of talking points, as those who played experienced severely contrasting fortunes on a dramatic weekend.</p>
      <p>There was a stunning display from Grujic and an agonizing cup final loss for Ojo, while the season came to a successful end for one Red.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full lowdown on all the action, starting with that star performance.</p>
      <h3>Grujic produced a midfield masterclass…</h3>

      <p>Grujic is wasting no time in proving his worth to new boss Jurgen Klinsmann, who was denied his first win as Hertha were held to a 2-2 draw at Frankfurt on Friday night.</p>
      <p>In that stalemate Grujic was the star of the show, as he scored one and assisted another to ensure his side took a point back to the German capital.</p>
      <p>The assist came first and it was a brilliant piece of play.</p>
      <p>Out on the left flank after breaking from midfield, Grujic produced a delightful, one-touch reverse flick through his marker’s legs to release Dodi Lukebakio who put Hertha 1-0 up.</p>

      <p>Grujic himself then doubled the lead on 63 minutes with a real poacher’s effort – converting from close range from Dedryck Boyata’s ball across the face of goal.</p>
      <p>It was a man-of-the-match performance from the Serbian, who now has three goals and two assists from 15 appearances this season.</p>
      <p>Such contributions will ensure he continues to play a key role as Hertha undertake a new era with Klinsmann at the helm.</p>
      <h3>There was cup final disappointment for Ojo…</h3>

      <p>Sunday’s mouth-watering Scottish <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/league-cup">League Cup</a> final against Celtic presented the ideal chance for Ojo’s Rangers to prove they are back to the force of old.</p>
      <p>At a rain-soaked Hampden Park, the Gers missed that opportunity, falling to a 1-0 defeat to their arch-rivals who snatched victory from a game Steven Gerrard’s side dominated.</p>
      <p>It made for a day of double-disappointment for Ojo, who was denied the chance to play his part as he watched on from the bench for the duration.</p>
      <p>Given how several of Rangers’ attacking players underperformed when it mattered most on the big stage, it may be a move the Reds legend regrets in hindsight.</p>
      <p>Ojo – and his teammates – will have to move on swiftly and attempt to bounce back by overhauling their rivals to emerge victorious from the season-long title race.</p>
      <h3>The season came to an end for one Red…</h3>

      <p>Brazil’s Serie A campaign drew to a close on Sunday night, thus bringing to an end <b>Allan Rodrigues</b>‘ season with Fluminense.</p>
      <p>Injury forced the Brazilian midfielder to miss his side’s last two games, including the final day 2-1 victory against Corinthians.</p>
      <p>That win signed off what has been a long, hard-fought campaign for Fluminense, who produced a late season surge to finish in 14th place and comfortably avoid relegation.</p>
      <p>Allan made 36 appearances in total and posted a solitary assist, and this spell back on home soil has unquestionably been the most rewarding of his senior career to date.</p>
      <p>Given how it has seemingly been a successful move for both sides, chances are we now see that deal made permanent.</p>
      <h3>A mixed bag for the remaining Reds…</h3>

      <p>Five more loanees joined Grujic in enjoying game time but there was only one who tasted victory.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/loris-karius/">Loris Karius</a></b> and his Besiktas team are flying currently, and the German helped his side record a sixth successive win in all competitions with a dramatic 3-2 victory at Kasimpasa.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the goalkeeper’s union, <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/tag/kamil-grabara/">Kamil Grabara</a></b>‘s run without a clean sheet in the Championship extended to five games after Huddersfield suffered a 2-0 derby-day loss to Leeds.</p>
      <p>North of the border, <b>Liam Millar</b> had an unsuccessful return to Kilmarnock’s starting XI, with the Canadian unable to notch his first goal since September as Killie lost 3-0 at Livingston.</p>
      <p>Back in Europe, <b>Taiwo Awoniyi</b> enjoyed a rare outing at Mainz 05 with a welcome extended run-out.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian played 45 minutes as his side went down 2-1 to Augsburg, and he couldn’t mark his return with a goal.</p>
      <p>Finally, it was another rewarding week at Kidderminster for <b>Rhys Williams</b>, who competed back-to-back full games – first drawing 1-1 against Gateshead before a 3-1 loss to Boston.</p>
