      <p>Legendary puppeteer Carroll Spinney, who brought Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to life on Sesame Street, died today. He was 85. Here's the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/obituaries/caroll-spinney-dead.html">New York Times obituary</a>. And from the <a href="https://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-room/press-releases/remembering-legendary-puppeteer-caroll-spinney">Sesame Workshop</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Caroll was an artistic genius whose kind and loving view of the world helped shape and define Sesame Street from its earliest days in 1969 through five decades, and his legacy here at Sesame Workshop and in the cultural firmament will be unending. His enormous talent and outsized heart were perfectly suited to playing the larger-than-life yellow bird who brought joy to generations of children and countless fans of all ages around the world, and his lovably cantankerous grouch gave us all permission to be cranky once in a while.</blockquote>
      <p>In 2018, Spinney retired from Sesame Street. Below is Sesame Workshop's video tribute to him and the following is from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/arts/television/sesame-street-big-bird.html">New York Times profile</a> from the time:</p>
      <blockquote>Although they had previously crossed paths in the 1960s, Spinney pinpointed a fateful encounter at a Salt Lake City puppeteers’ festival in 1969, when (Muppets creator Jim) Henson watched him try to perform a multimedia show that went gradually awry. <br/><br/>As Spinney recalled, Henson came to him afterward to say, “I liked what you were trying to do.” <br/><br/>Soon after, Henson invited Spinney to play two Muppet characters that were being developed for “Sesame Street,” which made its debut on public television later that year. One was Oscar, who was envisioned as a cranky, trash-loving purple character. (He was orange in his earliest appearances, before taking on his familiar green hue.) <br/><br/>The other was Big Bird, who was performed in a full body costume and who, Spinney said, he was originally asked to play as “a funny, dumb country yokel.” <br/><br/>After a few episodes, Spinney made a suggestion to the show’s producers. “I said, I think I should play him like he’s a child, a surrogate,” he recalled. “He can be all the things that children are. He can learn with the kids.”</blockquote>
