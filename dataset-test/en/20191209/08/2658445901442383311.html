      <h4>Our Reporter</h4>
      <p>The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) on Sunday faulted the presidency for comparing Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare with Boko Haram militants.</p>
      <p>SERAP said: “It is unacceptable to compare citizens who are also activists simply exercising their human rights including freedom of expression with militants who are killing our people and destroying property.”</p>

      <p>SERAP said what is happening to Sowore and Bakare shows clear attempts to further silence critics, activists and the media while the Federal Government continues to undermine the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.</p>
      <p>The group tweeted: “We condemn the statement today by @NigeriaGov issued by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant (Media and Publicity) to President Muhammadu Buhari, which seems to Boko Haram militants. To be absolutely clear: Sowore and Bakare are not terrorists.”</p>
