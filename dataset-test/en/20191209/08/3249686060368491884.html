      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/park-ji-hoon">Park Ji Hoon</a> is not a fan of broccoli!<br/><br/>On December 8 KST, as part of his official Twitter account's ongoing '<b>Too Muchoon (Today's TMI)</b>' recurring series, the <b>Maroo Entertainment </b>idol revealed one of the foods he hates the most.</p>
      <p><i>"Today at 'Inkigayo's convenience store, Jihoon ate a salad," </i>the caption for the tweet read. <i>"As soon as he opened the salad, he threw the broccoli out." </i>The tweet was paired with a number of hashtags, including <i>'Park Ji Hoon,' '360,' </i>and <i>'Broccoli_goodbye.'</i></p>
      <p>In the images attached to the tweet, Park Ji Hoon is seen posing with his salad and picking the broccoli out with a hilariously bothered expression.<br/><br/>Followers of his account left a number of comments reacting to this random information, saying things like: <i>"What are we going to do about the expression he's making! He's so cute," "That broccoli should've known better," </i>and <i>"Broccolli, come out here [and fight]. Stop making Ji Hoon's life difficult!"</i><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Park Ji Hoon is currently promoting his 2nd solo mini album '360,' which was released on December 4.</p>
