        <b>Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has proved once again that he will not go down easily after he unveiled a strategy he has deployed to fight back the 13 counts of conflict of interest and corruption levelled against him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/47474-heavy-gsu-presence-sonko-gets-arraigned-milimani">appearing at the Milimani Law Courts on Monday</a>, December 9, the flamboyant governor was in the company of a barrage of 12 lawyers reportedly forming his defense team among them high-ranking elected leaders.</p>
      <p>Leading the team is Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen who in the past represented Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro when he was arrested for causing chaos in a church and Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa when she faced ex-communication from the ODM party.</p>
      <p>Other elected leaders serving as the governor's lawyers include Makueni Senator Mutula Kilozo Junior and Makueni MP Dan Maanzo.</p>

      <p>Various other esteemed lawyers who were spotted in the court during the proceeding and were reportedly hired to defend the county boss include Nelson Havi, Cecil Miller, George Kithi, Alphonse Mutinda, Osundwa Michael, Harrison Kinyanjui and three others.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Kenyans.co.ke</i>, Sonko's communication representative Jacob Elkanah explained that there were many leaders in court because the governor is a people person.</p>
      <p>"You know, governor is a man of the people. Actually, there are a lot of leaders and all Sonko wants is people to keep calm," he explained.</p>
      <p>Embakasi East MP Babu Owino, who is also trained as a lawyer, was seen in the court alongside Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot.</p>
      <p>Sonko was <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/47391-how-detectives-pounced-sonko-escaping-arrest">arrested dramatically</a> on Friday, December 6, in Voi on Friday, December 6, as he reportedly <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/47391-how-detectives-pounced-sonko-escaping-arrest">attempted to escape</a> to Tanzania after catching wind of the impending arrest two days prior.</p>
      <p>He subsequently spent the weekend in jail ahead of his arraignement in connection with the misappropriation of over Ksh357 million together with other county officials.</p>
      <p>The county head was arrested along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway at a roadblock in Voi on his way to the coastal town - a journey EACC described as an attempt to evade arrest.</p>
      <p>A chopper was sent from the DCI headquarters along Kiambu Road to fetch the governor and deliver him to Nairobi so that charges could be preferred against him against him.</p>
      <p>He is also facing assault charges for allegedly attacking a police officer while on duty as well as two other counts of obstructing lawful arrest and offensive conduct.</p>
