      <h3>Chelsea FC are interested in a deal to re-sign Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/12/07/exclusive-chelsea-manager-frank-lampard-will-assess-antonio/">The Daily Telegraph</a> is reporting that the Blues manager Frank Lampard is set to decide whether he will launch a bid for the Netherlands international in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Chelsea FC’s potential move for Ake hinges on the fitness of Germany international Antonio Rudiger, who has been sidelined for a large part of the season.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Lampard will have £150m to spend on new signings in the January transfer window after their transfer ban was overturned last week.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> go on to claim that Chelsea FC are confident they can re-sign Ake for a deal worth around £40m after the Dutch centre-half was sold to Bournemouth for a £20m fee in 2017.</p>
      <p>The report reveals that Manchester United and Manchester City were quoted £70m when they made enquiries about Ake in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>Ake suffered a fitness blow on Saturday after the 24-year-old pulled his hamstring during Bournemouth’s 3-0 win against Liverpool FC on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC suffered a 3-1 loss to Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday to lose their grip on fourth place.</p>
      <p>The Blues are five points ahead of Manchester United.</p>
