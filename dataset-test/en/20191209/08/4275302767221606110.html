      <h1>Western Gateway residents fear developer holding up Swallow roundabout upgrade</h1>
      <h2>Fed-up residents living in the Western Gateway are demanding a leading property developer fulfills its pledge to upgrade the Swallow Roundabout.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:19:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/stefanmorkis/" target="_blank">Stefan Morkis</a></address>
      <p>Springfield Properties signed an agreement with Transport Scotland in 2016 stating the company would pay for upgrades to the roundabout once 270 homes were built.</p>
      <p>Although work was expected to being early next year, the company commissioned a traffic survey earlier this year and is seeking to revise the deal so it will not need to carry out any improvements until 370 homes have been built.</p>
      <p>Residents say they believe Springfield is deliberately dragging its feet but that urgent work is needed to alleviate traffic problems at peak times.</p>
      <p>And they also claim non-drivers are “prisoners” on the estate because Springfield has now completed work on footpaths which means the only way in and out is to use a car.</p>
      <p>Bill Batchelor, chairman of the Western Gateway Community Group, said: “We’ve been complaining about this for some time.</p>
      <p>“There is a clause that says they’re supposed to pay for the upgrade when 270 houses have been built but they want to delay it until 370 have been built.</p>
      <p>“There are already huge tailbacks at the roundabout between 8 and 9 in the morning.”</p>
      <p>Mr Batchelor said: “We were promised a bus service and there isn’t one. We were promised a primary school and there isn’t one.</p>
      <p>“People have been made promises and it is very frustrating.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The only way in and out is with a car as there are no paths. so safety issues are a major concern.</p>
      <p>“It’s fine if you are a driver but how do you send a 13 or 14-year-old out to school? You wouldn’t send your kids out to cross the Kingsway.”</p>
      <p>Lochee Labour  councillor Michael Marra, whose constituency includes the development, said: “Local people are desperate to have this work completed.</p>
      <p>“It should have been done months ago and I share the anger of residents that their concerns are falling on deaf ears.</p>
      <p>“With each passing week safety concerns are growing. The promise of works commencing at the start 2020 now looks to be untenable.</p>
      <p>“The delays must stop and the legal planning obligations, on which this major development was granted to the developers, must be met.”</p>
      <p>Transport Scotland confirmed Springfield is seeking to delay the upgrades but said they will only allow this if assurances over the purchase of the necessary land are received.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland has met with both Springfield Properties and Dundee City Council to discuss the request for a deferment of the implementation of the works to Swallow Roundabout.</p>
      <p>“Transport Scotland has sought assurances from both parties that issues of land ownership are able to be resolved and progressing suitably before formally agreeing to such a relaxation.</p>
      <p>“Transport Scotland will continue to work with both Springfield Developments and the Council in the delivery of the mitigation at the roundabout and allow development to proceed.”</p>
      <p>Springfield Properties central managing director Peter Matthews, said: “We are continuing to work with relevant authorities to progress upgrades to the Swallow Roundabout.</p>
      <p>“Once we have final approval, we can move forward with the plans to make improvements to the roundabout including implementing a new traffic light system.”</p>
      <p>A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We are aware of the ongoing issue at the Swallow Roundabout.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to support the improvement of this junction.”</p>
