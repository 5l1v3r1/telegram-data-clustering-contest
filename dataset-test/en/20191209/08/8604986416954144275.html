      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Larry Kim</a></address>
      <p>With the changing seasons, holiday decorations, and cheery music flowing from seemingly every storefront, one thing is clear -- the end of the year is upon us, and 2020 is not far away.</p>
      <p>The end of the year can be a great time to recollect, reflect on the last 12 months, and find areas where you can improve in the new year. </p>
      <p>Improvement doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong to begin with; but everybody can be constantly improving.</p>
      <p>Focusing on ways to improve yourself will lead to improvement at work, helping you achieve more in the coming year.</p>
      <p>Here are some ways that you can stay constantly improving once 2020 arrives:</p>

      <h3>1. Read Books -- Fiction and Nonfiction </h3>
      <p>Reading is a great way to learn new things and relax.</p>
      <p>Reading is a calming activity that helps you wind down, meditate, and gain knowledge that you might not have had before.</p>
      <p>That's why reading is probably the easiest way that you can stay improving in the new year.</p>
      <p>Of course, it's important to read things that will benefit you at work; read books to help you gain knowledge about your job, your industry, and best practices to do better work in 2020.</p>
      <p>Some of the top entrepreneurs in the world -- Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, for example -- <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/you-did-this-as-a-kid-but-the-greatest-entrepreneurs-never-stopped.html">are insatiable readers</a>. </p>
      <p>However, you also want to take time to read for pleasure. </p>
      <p><a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/the-health-benefits-of-reading-c95f24dfb971">Reading has a number of benefits</a>, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alleviating anxiety </li>
        <li>Reducing stress</li>
        <li>Lowering the risk of Alzheimer's </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And more.</p>
      <p>These benefits will improve your personal life and also increase your productivity and keep you always improving at work. </p>
      <h3>2. Listen to Podcasts Related to Your Industry </h3>
      <p>Reading has a close relative for people that are on the go -- podcasts.</p>
      <p>Podcasts have grown in popularity significantly over the last several years, and now there are thousands of podcasts, about anything you can imagine.</p>
      <p>I guarantee there are a multitude of <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-reasons-your-business-needs-to-be-podcasting.html">podcasts</a> to choose from in your industry.</p>
      <p>Podcasts are a great way to learn about industry news, events, and best practices.</p>
      <p>They're a great way to brush up on your skills and learn new ones.</p>
      <p>They're also a good way to gain new perspectives from other industry professionals or people passionate about the subject.</p>
      <p>Check out some podcasts related to your industry and use them to stay improving (on the go) in the new year.</p>
      <h3>3. Take a Course to Improve Your Skills </h3>
      <p>What better way to improve than actively learning?</p>
      <p>Even if you've graduated and gotten a degree, there is nothing wrong with continuing to improve your skills by <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/top-5-free-online-courses-for-digital-marketers.html">taking courses</a>.</p>
      <p>Local communities often offer courses for adults in a number of different subjects, from cooking classes to high-level computer software.</p>
      <p>You could also enroll in classes at a local college, consider getting a graduate certificate, or, if you haven't already, even consider a professional degree. </p>
      <p>Learning is the best way to improve your skills and become a better industry professional, and taking a course is like a fast track to gaining new skills. </p>
      <h3>4. Practice an Old Passion to Boost Your Creativity </h3>
      <p>Sometimes, when we're busy with work, we forget about our personal lives -- and our personal selves.</p>
      <p>But we all have hobbies and passions, and it's best not to let them be put on the back burner.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-ways-to-dramatically-improve-your-creativity.html">Revisiting an old passion will boost your creativity</a> which will help you at work. </p>
      <p>Having something to yourself in your free time to give attention to reduces your stress levels and takes your mind off of work.</p>
      <p>And to improve at work, sometimes we need to get our minds off of the job. </p>
      <p>Having passions and hobbies that you regularly practice also will help boost your creativity which improves your work, as it gives you a new perspective to view projects and problems as they arise. </p>
      <h3>5. Get Feedback and Critique </h3>
      <p>One great method to find ways to improve is by asking for critique and feedback from those that can provide it. </p>
      <p>Give those around you the opportunity to provide feedback about your work style, your management style, whatever you might want to improve as the year goes on. </p>
      <p>This allows everyone to reflect and consider how they can improve.</p>
      <p>Working to be a better business owner, boss, supervisor, or employee is a great way to stay improving in the new year -- it just requires a little help from others. </p>
      <h3>6. Work Towards A Goal</h3>
      <p>Every year, people make New Year's Resolutions; and while many people don't keep up with theirs, it's not a bad practice to get into.</p>
      <p>Especially for business. </p>
      <p>If you come up with some personal and professional goals at the beginning of the new year, it will give you a reason to stay improving as the year goes on.</p>
      <p>Goals require improvement to be met.</p>
      <p>You can't set a goal at the beginning of the year, do and change nothing, and still meet that goal by the end of it.</p>
      <p>Set lofty goals to push yourself; push yourself personally, and push yourself to <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/my-top-5-growth-marketing-secrets-revealed.html">grow your business</a>.</p>
      <p>My goal for the new year is for MobileMonkey to become internationally recognized by marketers as the world's best integrated Web chat, SMS, and Facebook Messenger <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/7-reasons-your-business-needs-a-facebook-messenger-chatbot.html">chatbot</a> platform for marketing and customer service.</p>
      <h3>7. Be Open to Change</h3>
      <p>There's no possible way to improve yourself at home or at work without being open to change.</p>
      <p>Improvement begets change; one cannot improve and stay exactly the same.</p>
      <p>In the new year, consider implementing ways that change can be accessible and ongoing at the workplace.</p>
      <p>Small and large company meetings that give employees the opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions without fear is a great first step towards implementing a constantly improving work life.</p>
      <p>The people around you likely have their own thoughts, feelings, and suggestions about how things currently are.</p>
      <p>If you're seeking to stay improving in the new year, it's important to reach out to those people and hear their opinions.</p>
      <h3>8. Get Around the Community</h3>
      <p>What better way to improve yourself than working to understand and help others?</p>
      <p>Exploring your community, both for leisure and to learn and help, is a great way to improve your knowledge and skills in the new year.</p>
      <p>It can be tough to work at a business in a community that you don't know or understand.</p>
      <p>Start by simply exploring your community.</p>
      <p>Learn the restaurants, the shops, the entertainment; this benefits you personally and it also benefits your business, as you will be able to know local businesses that you can work with in the future for various reasons. </p>
      <p>Then, begin finding ways to help the community as well.</p>
      <p>Volunteering, donating, etc.: these are all great ways to help your community while building connections and improving yourself along the way.</p>
      <p>The more you know your community, the more your community will know you and your business; which is great for business in the long run. </p>
      <h3>Improve Yourself to Improve Your Work </h3>
      <p>Improvement comes in stages.</p>
      <p>You can't improve your work without first improving yourself.</p>
      <p>While a number of these suggestions are to help you make improvements in your work life, several are to help you make improvements in your personal life, as well.</p>
      <p>Learning new things, revisiting your creativity, helping others, and envisioning goals are great ways to set yourself up for success in the new year.</p>
      <p>You'll improve yourself which will lead to improvements at work, allowing you to be the best you -- in and out of the office -- that you can be. </p>
