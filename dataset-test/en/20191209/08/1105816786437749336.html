      <h1>Boris Johnson, polarising leader focused on Brexit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:16:30+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>LONDON: </b>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to end the Brexit turmoil and unite Britain if re-elected this week, but critics accuse him of Trump-style populism that will only divide the country further.</p>
      <p>The former London mayor has toned down his trademark jokes and bluster ahead of Thursday’s vote, as he focuses on a promise to “Get Brexit Done” by finally taking Britain out of the European Union.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls suggest his efforts to present himself as a strong and optimistic leader are working and his Conservative party is on course to win a majority in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>But Johnson remains a polarising figure, not least for his leading role in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, which was marked by exaggerated claims about the EU and anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p>

      <p>His tendency to play to the crowd both as a politician and in his previous career as a journalist has also drawn accusations of racism and misogyny.</p>
      <p>The list of offences — writing about gay “bumboys” and veiled Muslim women looking like “letter boxes” — has grown with comments unearthed in the campaign, including about “feckless” working-class men and single mothers.</p>
      <p>But he denies he meant any harm and supporters dismiss this as “just Boris”, welcoming his off-the-cuff style as a sharp contrast to the soundbites of many other politicians.</p>
      <p>Crucially, many voters believe he is a better proposition than left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who polls put as the most unpopular opposition leader of the past 45 years.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s relaxed style and lack of attention to detail has led to accusations of incompetence — a perception fuelled by a chequered stint as foreign minister under former premier Theresa May.</p>
      <p>He was notably accused by the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman held in Tehran for sedition, of jeopardising her case by mischaracterising her job at the time.</p>
      <p>His aides point instead to the coordinated expulsion of Russian diplomats by many of Britain’s allies, including the United States, after a nerve agent attack in England last year blamed on Moscow.</p>
      <p>As prime minister, Johnson defied his critics in renegotiating May’s unpopular EU divorce deal.</p>
      <p>“Those who did not take him seriously were wrong,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at the time.</p>
      <p>His credibility took a hit when, despite MPs passing a law to stop his threat of leaving the EU with no deal, Johnson refused to acknowledge Brexit would be delayed past October until it actually happened.</p>
      <p>He now hopes that, if he wins enough seats, he can get his deal through in time to leave the EU on the next deadline of January 31.</p>
      <p>However, experts question his pledge to get a new trade agreement with Brussels by December 2020, warning this is only possible with big compromises.</p>
      <p>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York in 1964 into a high-achieving family of future politicians and media personalities.</p>
      <p>According to his sister, Rachel, as a child he once aspired to become “world king”.</p>
      <p>He attended the elite Eton boys school and Oxford University to become a journalist for The Times — a job he promptly lost for making up a quote.</p>
      <p>Johnson was later sacked from the Tories’ top team for lying about an extra-marital affair, one of several personal scandals that have marked his career.</p>
      <p>Twice divorced, he now lives in Downing Street with his girlfriend, former Tory party staffer Carrie Symonds. But he rarely talks about his private life and some five children.</p>
      <p>He makes an exception for his great-grandfather Ali Kemal, who was briefly interior minister in the last grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire’s government — a fact he often cites to reject accusations of racism.</p>
      <p>He also points to his two successful terms as mayor of liberal London as proof of that he is a moderate, unifying “One Nation Conservative”.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s path to power was rocky — his first tilt at the Tory leadership in 2016 failed after his closest ally betrayed him.</p>

      <p>But his resignation from May’s cabinet last year in protest at her Brexit plan laid the groundwork for his successful leadership bid in July this year.</p>
      <p>He has now staked everything on this election.</p>
      <p>A clear victory would secure him a permanent legacy among Britain’s most influential leaders, including his hero Winston Churchill.</p>
      <p>But defeat would put Brexit at risk and consign him to the growing list of leaders felled by rows over the country’s role in Europe.</p>
