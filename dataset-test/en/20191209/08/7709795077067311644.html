        <b>The Kansas City Chiefs beat the New England Patriots 23-16 to secure a fourth consecutive AFC West championship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Patrick Mahomes's tough season continued as his Kansas City Chiefs beat the New England Patriots 23-16, with the quarterback injuring his throwing hand during the road victory which secured a fourth consecutive AFC West championship.</p>
      <p>The game started well for the Patriots, who scored a touchdown on their first drive while Mahomes threw an interception on the Chiefs' first trip up the field.</p>
      <p>The signal-caller seemed to injure his right hand on the second drive but stayed on the field to help his side score 23 unanswered points, securing the win despite a late New England rally.</p>
      <p>Mahomes - who threw for 283 yards against the Patriots - already suffered an ankle injury early in the season and dislocated his kneecap while playing the Denver Broncos. He was spotted in the x-ray room at Foxborough after Sunday's game.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Chicago Bears beat the Dallas Cowboys 31-24, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers closed out the Indianapolis Colts 38-35 and the Minnesota Vikings were 20-7 victors over the Detroit Lions.</p>
      <p>The Green Bay Packers won 20-15 against the Washington Redskins, the Broncos got just their fifth win of the season as they triumphed 38-24 over the Houston Texans and the Ohio derby finished with the Cleveland Browns scoring 27 points to the Cincinnati Bengals' 19.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Drew Brees threw for 349 yards but could not secure the win at the Superdome as his New Orleans Saints fell 48-46 to the San Francisco 49ers, who are now 11-2 for the season.</p>
      <p>The Atlanta Falcons went 40-20 over the Carolina Panthers, the New York Jets eked out a 22-21 victory against the Miami Dolphins and the Los Angeles Chargers trounced the Jacksonville Jaguars 45-10.</p>
      <p>The Tennessee Titans left their mark during their final visit to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, blasting the Oakland Raiders 42-21 to tie the Texans for first place in the AFC South.</p>
      <p>The Baltimore Ravens continued their winning ways to beat the Buffalo Bills 24-17, the Arizona Cardinals fell 23-17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Los Angeles Rams won 28-12 over Seattle Seahawks.</p>
