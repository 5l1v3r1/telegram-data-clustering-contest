      <p>Widely regarded as a legend of Waterford hurling, <a href="https://punditarena.com/gaa/thepateam/dan-shanahan-waterford-sully/">Shanahan</a> was one of the country’s most feared full-forwards throughout a playing career that saw him win four Munster titles, a National League crown and three All-Star awards as well as the 2007 hurler of the year award.</p>
      <p>Fergal O’Brien was appointed to the hot-seat in October of this year, taking over from Donal O’Rourke who took the camogie side to unprecedented heights during his two-year stint with back-to-back All-Ireland quarter-final appearances.</p>
