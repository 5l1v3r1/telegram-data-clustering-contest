      <h1>PM Khan inaugurates Pakistan's first 'Science and Technology Park'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:55:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nation.com.pk/NewsSource/web-desk" target="_blank">Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan has on Monday said that those people who abandon their vision do not succeed ever.</p>
      <p>The premier inaugurated Pakistan’s first National Science and Technology Park in Islamabad in the vicinity of National University of Science and Technology (NUST) and addressed the ceremony.</p>
      <p>“Everything starts with a vision and those nations which lose confidence become dependent on others. There is no plan B when you follow your vision as you have burnt all your bridges. We saw a plan B a few days ago and then came a plan C as well.</p>
      <p>“A good captain knows where to utilize his players and that is why I have appointed Fawad Chaudhry as Minister for Science and Technology. I appreciate his efforts.”</p>
      <p>It is pertinent here to mention that National Science and Technology Park is being hailed as the country’s largest innovation and research ecosystem. The high-tech IT Park houses have more than forty companies, including start-ups, Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and tech giants.</p>
      <p>According to the NUST statement, the park will serve as a launchpad for the country’s leading researchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs.</p>
