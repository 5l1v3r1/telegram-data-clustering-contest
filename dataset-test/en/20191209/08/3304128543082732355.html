      <p>Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been arraigned at the Milimani Law Court after his dramatic arrest on Friday, December, 6 on the charges of over Sh357 million graft case.</p>
      <p>He was presented before the Anti-Corruption Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti alongside eight other Nairobi County officials who have been linked to the irregular and illegal procurement of tenders.</p>
      <p>Sonko, who has been arraigned under heavy security outside the courts and around the Central Business District (CBD) has been charged with over 20 counts, among them conspiracy to commit crime of corruption, money laundering, acquisition of proceeds of crime, abuse of office, conflict of interest among others.</p>
      <p>The accused including governor Sonko pleaded not guilty with the prosecution objecting the bail application of the governor, but not objecting the bail application of the other accused.</p>

      <p>Others include George Kithi, Alphonse Mutinda, Harrison Kinyanjui and Osundwa Michael.</p>

      <p>The companies have been accused of benefiting from the funds irregularly acquired from the Nairobi County Government.</p>
      <p>Nairobi county is the only county without a deputy governor, hence in case Sonko is convicted and sentenced or over 12 months the speaker will take over for a period of 60 days before a by-election.</p>
      <p>The position of the deputy governor is vacant following the resignation of Polycarp Igathe, who went back to the corporate world.</p>
