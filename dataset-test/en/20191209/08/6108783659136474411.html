      <h3>With "new game reveals, release date announcements" and more.</h3>
      <p>The last <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/state-of-play/">PlayStation State of Play livestream for 2019</a> will air early Wednesday morning in Australia, PlayStation has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The livestream will take place at 1am AEDT on Wednesday, 11 December and can be viewed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/playstation">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/playstation">Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/12/06/state-of-play-airs-live-tuesday-december-10/">Sony has said</a> the livestream will run for approximately 20 minutes and feature “new game reveals, release date announcements, new gameplay footage, PlayStation Worldwide Studios updates, and more. It was also confirmed we will not be getting any news about the PS5 during the last State of Play for the year.</p>
      <p>What do you predict from the <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/state-of-play/">State of Play livestream</a>? We’re hoping for <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/rumours/spider-man-2-ps5-release-expected-2021/">a confirmation of <i>Spider-Man 2</i></a>, though that might be a stretch.</p>
