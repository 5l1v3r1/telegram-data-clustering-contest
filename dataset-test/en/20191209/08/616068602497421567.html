      <p>South Africa's Zozibini Tunzi was crowned Miss Universe 2019, giving the country its second title in three years in a pageant that also saw strong showings from contestants from Puerto Rico and Mexico.</p>
      <p>Tunzi, a 26-year-old gender violence activist, said she was forced to abandon her studies for a year because of her family's economic difficulties, but her modeling work allowed her to continue her education. She studied public relations at Cape Peninsula University of Technology.</p>
      <p>When asked during Sunday's contest what it is most important to teach young girls today, Tunzi said leadership, unleashing a standing ovation at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <p>She said she grew up in a world where women who looked like her were not seen as beautiful. It is time for this to end, she said.</p>
      <p>Puerto Rico's Madison Anderson was elected first finalist, and Miss Mexico Sofía Aragón second.</p>
      <p>Tunzi's triumph is the second for South Africa in Miss Universe. South Africa's Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters was crowned in 2017.</p>
      <p>A total of 90 countries participated in this year's contest, which was hosted by Steve Harvey.</p>
