        <b>Farmers have complained of BBC bias after a Christmas advert featuring turkeys wearing jumpersprocliming "I love vegans".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The animated birds are seen celebrating meat-free Christmas meals in the short film released by the BBC.</p>
      <p>They claim “less of us have been gobbled this year”, while a yoga teacher says “we don’t have to eat rabbit food for breakfast any more”.</p>
      <p>The National Farming Union claim it is another example of a perceived bias against rural communities.</p>

      <p>Union vice president Stuart Roberts said: “We are deeply concerned that  the BBC appears to have started campaigning for a vegan diet in advertising for its Christmas programming, none of which appears to cover veganism in its schedule.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t appear to sit within the BBC’s editorial guidelines, which clearly states that they shouldn’t be a campaigning organisation, and this advert takes our concerns about the BBC’s impartiality in its coverage of meat issues a step further.”</p>
      <p>Nick Ferrari is asking if you think there is anything wrong with the advert. Watch it at the top of the page.</p>
