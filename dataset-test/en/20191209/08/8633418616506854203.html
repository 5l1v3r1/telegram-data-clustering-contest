      <p>A new leak pertaining to the Galaxy S11+ points to Samsung using a massive 1/1.3-inch 108MP sensor on the handset.</p>

      <p>Apart from 108 million pixels, the sensor itself is also physically bigger than a traditional smartphone camera sensor. For comparison, the Galaxy S10 comes with a 1/2.55-inch 12MP camera, while the Huawei Mate 30 Pro features a 1/1.7-inch 40MP sensor. This means that if the rumor ends up being true, the primary camera sensor on the Galaxy S11+ will be substantially bigger than what Huawei uses in its smartphones as well.</p>
      <p>This is not the same 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/samsung-introduces-108mp-mobile-image-sensor-built-in-collaboration-with-xiaomi">Samsung has developed in collaboration with Xiaomi</a>. Instead, the Korean company apparently plans on using an "exclusive custom sensor" that offers superior image quality when compared to the 108MP camera sensor we have seen so far in a <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/xiaomi-launches-mi-note-10-redmi-note-8t-and-mi-tv-4s-in-europe/">couple of Xiaomi smartphones</a>. This custom sensor will also be more expensive than the 108MP Bright HMX sensor.</p>

      <p>Apart from sensor quality and image processing improvements, the bigger sensor on the Galaxy S11+ will give it a major advantage in low-light scenarios. The dynamic range will also be better as the bigger sensor will be able to absorb more light.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11+ is expected to come with a penta-camera setup which apart from the 108MP camera is expected to include an ultra-wide angle shooter, a 5x telephoto sensor, and a ToF sensor.</p>
      <p>Rumors surrounding the Galaxy S11+ point to it <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-could-feature-a-108mp-camera/">coming with an 108MP camera sensor</a> that can <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-could-offer-8k-video-recording-new-camera-modes/">record 8K videos</a>. The phone will also come with some innovative new camera modes, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/samsung-may-introduce-a-120hz-display-with-the-galaxy-s11-series/">a 120Hz AMOLED display</a>, and an Exynos 990/Snapdragon 865 chipset along with 12GB RAM. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-renders-show-five-rear-cameras/">Renders of the Galaxy S11</a> and Galaxy S11+ have also already leaked giving us a clear look at their design.</p>
