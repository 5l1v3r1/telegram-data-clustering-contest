      <p>The incident is said to have happened just before 6pm.</p>
      <p>According to Radio Clyde, eyewitnesses claim they saw "around 40 Rangers fans wearing balaclavas" throwing bottles at the boozer after getting off a bus.</p>
      <p>Cops confirmed they had been called to the boozer.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "Police called to a pub, the Queens Park Café, on Victoria Road, Glasgow around 5.40 pm on Sunday, 8 December 2019 following a report of a disturbance.</p>
      <p>"No trace on police arrival. Enquiries are continuing."</p>

      <p>A man who answered the phone at the pub this evening said they would not be commenting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5043540/rangers-0-celtic-1-betfred-cup-final/">Celtic won the final 1-0</a>, thanks to a Christopher Jullien strike, despite Rangers dominating.</p>
      <p>We told how Gers star <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5043756/rangers-fc-news-ryan-jack-crying-celtic/">Ryan Jack was seen crying into boss Steven Gerrard's arms</a> after the narrow defeat.</p>
      <p>At full-time it was despair for Rangers stars as they broke down as the Hoops celebrated their tenth successive domestic trophy.</p>
      <p>Gers' everpresent this season Jack was caught sobbing into Gerrard's arms at full-time.</p>
      <p>Gerrard embraced the tough-tackling midfielder to comfort him as he was overcome with emotion after the game finished.</p>
      <p>And Ibrox legend Ally McCoist reckons Alfredo Morelos didn't believe he would score as he stepped up to take a penalty.</p>
      <p>The striker’s second-half penalty was saved by <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> keeper Fraser Forster, who delivered a man-of-the-match performance as his side lifted the Betfred Cup.</p>
