        <b>The Premier League hopes supporters will receive more information about VAR decisions on giant screens in time for the festive fixtures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is hoped more detailed messages will appear on giant screens at games from December 21, or Boxing Day at the latest.</p>
      <p>The Premier League has commissioned Hawk-Eye, who provide the in-stadia updates, to offer more written information on screens so fans know what incidents are being considered by VARs at Stockley Park.</p>
      <p>Advanced talks will take place at the Premier League's headquarters in London on Friday.</p>

      <p>Under new guidelines, agreed during a club meeting last month, messages will appear on giant screens with more information about decisions under review.</p>
      <p>For instance, screens will say, 'Checking Penalty - Possible Handball', rather than just, 'Checking Penalty'.</p>
      <p>The Premier League will continue to show video clips of all overturned decisions, but is not allowed to show the clips until the referee has made a final decision.</p>
      <p>Talks will affect 18 Premier League clubs - Old Trafford and Anfield do not have giant screens and are not required to have them, under the laws of the game.</p>
      <p>Arsene Wenger, FIFA's new Chief of Global Football Development, said last week: "At the moment, you have two big clubs [Manchester United and Liverpool] with no [giant] screens. That is a problem that has to be resolved as well in the future."</p>
