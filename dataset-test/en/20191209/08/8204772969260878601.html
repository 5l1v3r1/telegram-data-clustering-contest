      <p>Nearly 1,000 tourists are stranded in a small <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=New+Zealand">New Zealand</a> town after stormy weekend weather triggered landslides and flooding along its main road.</p>
      <p>Authorities said road access to Franz Josef is not likely to be restored until Friday.</p>
      <p>Some of the tourists were choosing to leave by helicopter or small plane while others were waiting until the road reopened.</p>
      <p>Westland mayor Bruce Smith said many of the 970 tourists in Franz Josef were taking the news in their stride but some were frustrated their travel plans had been disrupted.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith said there were about 20 planes and helicopters flying in and out of the town to help people leave.</p>
      <p>He said some tourists wanted to stay with their vehicles while others were trying to get confirmation their travel insurance would cover the extra costs of flying out.</p>
      <p>“They all have the option of taking fixed wing planes or helicopters,” Mr Smith said.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a question of who writes the cheque. I understand that.”</p>
      <p>The mayor said there would have been many more people stuck if the slips had occurred a few weeks later.</p>
      <p>He said the summer tourist season peaks in February, when the town gets about 6,000 tourists travelling through each day.</p>
      <p>Dan Burt, a spokesman for aviation tourist operator Inflite, said it had flown about 60 tourists from the town on Monday on two planes and two helicopters it had diverted to the area.</p>
      <p>He said it was charging them its normal rate of about 600 New Zealand dollars (€355) for the trip out.</p>
      <p>Mr Burt said many tour operators and rental car companies had been good about allowing people to leave their cars behind.</p>
      <p>“They’ve said, ‘Look, you get out of there and we’ll worry about the vehicle later’,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to make sure people have a really good experience when they fly with us. We don’t want their last impression of New Zealand to be three days stuck in Franz Josef.”</p>
      <p>Tourists typically visit the area to view the Franz Josef Glacier.</p>
      <p>Stormy weather across New Zealand over the weekend caused disruption and road closures in many parts of the country, and at least one person has died after a volcano erupted on White Island.–PA</p>
