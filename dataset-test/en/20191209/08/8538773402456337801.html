      <h1>Anthony Joshua could fight at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in next bout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:29:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:29</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Joshua could fight at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in his next bout, according to his promoter, Eddie Hearn.</p>
      <p>Joshua avenged his June TKO loss to Andy Ruiz Jr. -- the only defeat of his professional career -- by <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/story/_/id/28246015/anthony-joshua-dominates-andy-ruiz-jr-win-rematch">beating the Mexican American via unanimous decision</a> in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. In doing so, the Brit regained his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles.</p>
      <p>And with Joshua (23-1, 21 KOs) expected to return to action soon, as mandatory challengers Oleksandr Usyk and Kubrat Pulev await the 30-year-old, Hearn is already considering possible venues for Joshua's next contest.</p>
      <p>"Wembley doesn't look great, date-wise," Hearn said. "Tottenham Hotspur is a nice new stadium for a U.K. fight. We've got to look at it.</p>
      <p>"We spoke to Spurs about hosting [the Ruiz rematch], which they were keen to do, but unfortunately the dates didn't work out.</p>
      <p>"They would be keen to do it and it would be a nice stadium to do it in London."</p>
      <p>Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur's home ground hosted NFL fixtures in October this year and is set to host Rugby Union and Rugby League games next year.</p>
