      <p>James Haskell wanted to repay "amazing" Caitlyn Jenner for the kindness she showed him in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The rugby star has revealed the touching reason he was on the bridge when the former Olympic athlete finally made her departure after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">three weeks in the camp</a> .</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, 70, left on Friday night, but her family weren't there to greet her.</p>
      <p>So James, 34, went along to the studio instead, and has now opened up about why, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celebs-james-haskell-wanted-21051368">The Mirror reports</a> .</p>
      <p>In a post on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , he wrote: "Such an amazing camp mate. I am glad I could repay her for all her kindness and support when I was in the jungle.</p>
      <p>"It was really important to me she had someone there. Its crazy when you come out!"</p>
      <p>Stars of the series are always met by their loved ones at the end of the bridge for an emotional reunion. But none of Caitlyn's family, including famous daughters Kendall and Kylie, who are currently both jetting off on holiday, made it out to see her.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn isn't all alone out there, however: her close friend and business partner, Sophia Hitchins, did fly to Australia, but wasn't in time to meet the star when she left camp.</p>
      <p>Sophia greeted her back in her room and they have since been spotted relaxing together on the beach in Australia.</p>
      <p>Speaking after leaving camp, Caitlyn told Ant and Dec: “I came here to test myself. I did the show 16 years ago, I turned 70 and thought what a challenge.</p>
      <p>"I knew it wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
      <p>"First night I didn’t think I would make it to the next night, but I met some of the greatest people, there wasn't one person causing a problem.</p>
      <p>"I couldn’t believe I made it to three weeks. I am ready to get out.”</p>
