      <p>I was rereading an old interview with the author Marlon James the otter day when I saw the essay "Walking While Black" by Garnette Cadogan mentioned and I remember I meant to read it once but had more important things to do at the time so I put it off. Seeing the mention again I decided to Google it and read it. I did read it and it made me see what I was blind to before. I never understood White Privilege and I hate people who toss it in my face just because I am white. Who in the HELL are they to assume I have had it better than others just because I am a White Male? I have had a rough life not even Chris Rock would like to trade places with me. For people who grew up as I did with abuse it would be hard, damn near impossible to see where there has been any Privilege in their lives.</p>
      <p>But then I read the essay "Walking While Black" by Garnette Cadogan and my eyes were opened. I have walked in some really rough places too in my time Gary, Indiana for almost 50 Bucks and a dare at 3 in the morning for one though I knew what I was getting myself into. I prepared myself by getting very drunk and I don't remember much but I remember some and doing it did not prove to anyone that I have the biggest "set" in Lake County Indiana only that I was crazy, and Drunk and I never would have walked through Gary, Indiana sober. "Walking while White" in America is nothing compared to "Walking While Black" in America not even in Gary, Indiana plus I only did it once. There were many other places I walked in the middle of the night dangerous places though if I was Black instead of white for sure I would be dead of that I have no doubt and that is where my White Privilege lies. So now I must admit I have White Privilege though I don't want it, everyone is equal in my book. I believe in Coexistence even with others who don't believe in it which is kinda weird I guess. The essay has more to do with run-ins with the police and I haven't had many that were that bad just because of the color of my skin. However, I have been beaten up because I am white, slashed with a knife and raped because I am white, almost drowned because of the color of my skin, almost murdered once because of the color of my skin. It's a good thing I had a gun that day or I would not be here. I have had my unprivileged times too during those times. I had no privilege at all though they had nothing to do white "Walking or with the police." I guess all of us are privileged in different ways.</p>

      <p>38 Years or so ago John Lennon was shot to death, where were you when you heard about it? I was in the basement of Robinson's Department Store working in the Shipping Department. I was confused wondering why anyone would shoot John Lennon and of course, I was bummed. Anyway just wondering what ya all were up to then. I heard from another Citizen reporter that there was a stabbing somewhere on the WestSide Saturday Evening I go to bed early so I missed hearing the call.
