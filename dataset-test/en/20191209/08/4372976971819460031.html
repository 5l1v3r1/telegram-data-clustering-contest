      <p>TOKYO â€” Japan's markets watchdog will likely recommend soon that the financial regulator fine <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/nissan/">Nissan</a> about $22 million (2.4 billion yen) over false reporting on its financial statement, public broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Nissan's former Chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November last year over allegations of financial misconduct, including understating his salary by around $84.71 million (9.1 billion yen) over a period of nearly a decade and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to the books of Nissan, Japan's No. 2 automaker.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in June that Nissan would be <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/06/26/nissan-37-million-fine-over-ghosn-pay/">fined up to 4 billion yen</a> and it may receive a reduced fine of around 2.4 billion yen if the automaker filed documentation to the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) before the formal investigation begins, citing a source.</p>
      <p>The fine would cover a four-year period through March 2018, the source previously told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Nissan and the SESC could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
