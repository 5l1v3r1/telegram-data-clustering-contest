        <li>Dean Unglert straight-up said that he will probably never get married to Caeylnn Miller-Keyes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, Caelynn has talked about there possibly being wedding bells in their future.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Welp, it looks like Caelynn Miller-Keyes and <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a29643918/dean-unglert-mesh-well-caelynn-miller-keyes-dating/">Dean Unglert</a> won’t be swapping <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a28999617/bachelor-in-paradise-caelynn-miller-keyes-dean-unglert-dating-living-in-van/">van life</a> for married life anytime soon, if Dean has anything to do with it. In a new interview, he didn’t hold his feelings back for anyone—not even for our poor <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caelynn-miller-keyes-talks-potentially-marrying-dean-unglert/">Caelynn, who has talked about being open to marriage before</a>.</p>
      <p>When <i><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/dean-unglert-caelynn-miller-keyes-and-i-are-never-getting-married/">Us Weekly</a></i> caught up with Dean at an event and asked him if he sees marriage in his and Caelynn’s future, he pretty much said that marriage is a big fat pipe dream, LOL.</p>

        <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a29643918/dean-unglert-mesh-well-caelynn-miller-keyes-dating/">Dean Was Super Hesitant to Date Caelynn at First</a>
      </p>
      <p>“That’s never going to happen,” he said. “She does joke around about us getting married all the time, and I always say, ‘Sorry, it’s not going to happen.’ I don’t know, I’m super unconventional and she obviously is a little more conventional. We joke around about it. Just try to keep expectations to a minimum, you know? Like I said on the show, underpromise, overdeliver.” Say it with me: Yikes! 😬</p>
      <p>Oh, but that’s not all—Dean’s also got ~feelings~ about having kids too, and they seem a lil different from Caelynn’s. “The older I get, I feel like the less and less I want kids. I remember when I was a teenager, I was always so dead-set on having kids, but the world’s in flux. I don’t know if it’s necessarily the most responsible thing to do to bring a child into this world,” he added, before admitting Caelynn feels differently. “That being said, she wants kids, so I don’t know. I don’t know if I don’t want kids just because she wants kids, and I don’t want to get married just because she wants to get married.”</p>
      <p>This is honestly very awkward, because not only is Caelynn open to marriage with Dean (“Maybe that’s in our future, but it would be way down our future,” she told <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caelynn-miller-keyes-talks-potentially-marrying-dean-unglert/"><i>Us</i> last month</a>), but she also uprooted her entire life <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29448145/caelynn-miller-keyes-talks-living-van-dean-unglert/">TO MOVE INTO A VAN</a> with him! I would be beyond pissed if my mans didn’t see me as marriage material after living in a car and taking water bottle baths in the name of love. But you know, to each their own!</p>
