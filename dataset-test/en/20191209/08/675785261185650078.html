      <h1>Jamie Redknapp explains impact Fred has had on Man Utd- and why he finally deserves credit</h1>
      <h2>The Brazilian midfielder's performances have improved greatly this season following a difficult start to life at Old Trafford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:29:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:29</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp thinks that Manchester United midfielder Fred has proved his critics wrong with some impressive recent performances.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old struggled to settle in the Premier League last season following his Â£52m move from Shakhtar Donetsk and received a great deal of criticism for his sub-par showings.</p>
      <p>So far in the current campaign he has looked much more assured, however, and played a key role in United's last two victories against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>And writing in his column for the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7769663/REDKNAPP-Everton-Duncan-Ferguson-job-rest-Premier-League-season.html">Daily Mail</a> Redknapp said Fred deserved praise for turning his form around.</p>
      <p>"A defeat against Astana and draw at home to Aston Villa one week, then back-to-back wins over Tottenham and Manchester City the next," Redknapp said. "It would be too much to say Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have turned a corner but what an uplifting few days for the Norwegian.</p>

      <p>"Marcus Rashford is on fire and getting bums off seats. Mason Greenwood, who I hear does amazing things in training, is such a prospect, too. But the player I'm most pleased for is Fred.</p>
      <p>"The stick he received was remarkable. From 'useless' to 'waste of money', he was called it all. Maybe he is not the answer for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in the long term. Maybe he won't be their midfield lynchpin for years to come.</p>

      <p>"But he has dug deep and refused to let the critics win. He was superb against City. In the same way everyone was quick to criticise, let's give him the credit he deserves, too."</p>
      <p>United are in Europa League action on Thursday against AZ Alkmaar, and will then look to make it three Premier League wins in a row when they take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> on Sunday and try to close the gap on fourth placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , who are currently five points ahead of the Red Devils.</p>
