      <h3>Martin Keown has hailed Manchester United summer signing Aaron Wan-Bissaka as the best one-on-one defender in the Premier League.</h3>
      <p>The England international produced a commanding performance in Manchester United’s 2-1 victory over Manchester City in the Manchester derby at The Etihad on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in the opening half hour put Manchester United in a commanding position before the visitors dug deep for the final 60 minutes.</p>
      <p>Wan-Bissaka completed five successful tackles during the derby victory as the 22-year-old was the away side’s standout defender in their 2-1 win against the Citizens.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal defender Keown was impressed with Wan-Bissaka’s performance up against Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling in the Manchester derby.</p>
      <p>“He’s a magnificent defender, simply the best one against one defender in the Premier League,” Keown told <i>Match Of The Day</i> on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“He’s patient, look how close he gets to his opponent.</p>
      <p>“[Raheem] Sterling has got electric pace but it doesn’t matter because he goes in. He takes charge of things.</p>
      <p>“People thought I was good and I think this guy is ahead of me. He has got that arrogance and great pace. He picks his moment, it’s brilliant defending.</p>
      <p>“His team-mates know he is their best defender.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United signed Wan-Bissaka in a £50m deal from Crystal Palace in the summer transfer window following months of speculation.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils defender has started 14 of their 16 games in the Premier League this season, picking up four yellow cards in the process.</p>
      <p>Wan-Bissaka has made a further four appearances in the Europa League and the League Cup.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are in fifth position in the Premier League table and five points adrift of fourth-placed Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils will welcome Everton to Old Trafford in their next Premier League fixture next Sunday.</p>
