      <h1>Perthshire villagers rally round to save Christmas lights after vandals wreck them</h1>
      <h2>The spirit of Christmas is alive and well in Kennoway despite vandals wrecking the village’s festive lights.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:05:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/aileenrobertson/" target="_blank">Aileen Robertson</a></address>
      <p>Thugs destroyed the community’s tree lights last week, leaving the centrepiece of the Yuletide display in darkness just days before the official switch on.</p>
      <p>But local businesses and residents were determined not to let anyone spoil Christmas and managed to raise around £1,000 in just two days to see the lights reinstated.</p>
      <p>A number of businesses and organisations made donations of £100 and a collection bucket was in place at Millerfield Stores.</p>
      <p>And the illuminations were launched as planned by local minister Rev Allan Morton, with villagers turning out in the wind and rain to celebrate the occasion on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Bob McPhail, chairman of Kennoway Community Shed, said: “I’m so proud of everybody.</p>
      <p>“The community support that these people have showed in two days was totally overwhelming and humbling.</p>
      <p>“It kept us going because it was a big kick in the teeth for us all for that to happen.”</p>
      <p>The damage was found on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Someone had taken the lights off the tree and cut them into pieces.</p>
      <p>“Some people have decided to pull them off the tree and cut them up with a knife or pliers,” said Mr McPhail.</p>
      <p>Fife Council had supplied the Christmas tree lights but was unable to meet the cost of replacing them.</p>
      <p>Mr McPhail said the council arranged for a contractor to put up the replacement lights and he is confident enough has been raised to pay for the work when the invoice arrives.</p>
      <p>He added: “With the Christmas tree just in front of where everyone gathers for the switch on, everyone would have been looking at a tree with no lights.</p>
      <p>“It would have lost the festive feeling.”</p>

      <p>He said police were investigating the vandalism and had asked to see CCTV footage of the area.</p>
      <p>Although the council usually takes care of the tree display, the other decorations are provided by the community.</p>
      <p>Mr McPhail said: “Just to put the lights up and take them down can cost as much as £1,500 or £1,600, and we have to find that money first.”</p>
      <p>Local resident Belinda Newman said: “This really seems to have brought the community together like I’ve never seen before. I has been wonderful.”</p>
