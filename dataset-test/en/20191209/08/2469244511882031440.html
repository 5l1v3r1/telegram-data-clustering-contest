      <p>At least five people have died and more fatalities are likely after a volcano erupted on a small New Zealand island, police said.</p>
      <p>Police Deputy Commissioner John Tims said 23 people had been taken from White Island in the country's Bay of Plenty, some of whom are injured.</p>
      <p>He was unclear about the number who remained and were unaccounted for but said the total number of people on the island when it erupted was fewer than 50.</p>
      <p>Visitors walking inside the crater were believed to have been caught up in the explosion.</p>
      <p>The island, a favourite of tourists, erupted with a large plume of ash and steam Monday.</p>
      <p>New Zealanders and foreign tourists are believed to be involved, police added.</p>
      <p>Mr Tims said it was too dangerous for police and rescue services to travel to the island but they wanted to urgently get back as quickly as they could.</p>
      <p>He said there had been no contact with those who remained missing on the island.</p>

      <p>"There remain a number of people on the island who are unaccounted for,"Â  a statement from police said.</p>
      <p>Royal Caribbean International said guests from its cruise ship Ovation of the Seas had been visiting White Island.</p>
      <p>"A number of our guests were touring the island today," the company said.</p>
      <p>"We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities. Please keep all those affected in your prayers."</p>
      <p>The company statement said the ship would remain there overnight until it learned more on the situation.</p>
      <p>"My god," wrote Michael Schade on Twitter as he posted video of the eruption.</p>
      <p>"My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it. Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable."</p>
