      <h2>Police are stepping up patrols at an abandoned psychiatric hospital after a spate of thefts.</h2>

      <p>Crooks have stripped large quantities of lead from the roof of the old Murray Royal Hospital at Bridgend, on the edge of Perth.</p>
      <p>Locals say there have been persistent problems at the boarded up site since the summer.</p>
      <p>Now Police Scotland have pledged to increase patrols around the A-listed building, while landowners ramp up security with new CCTV.</p>
      <p>A Force spokesman said: “We are aware of a number of break-ins and thefts at the old Murray Royal Hospital building and our enquiries are ongoing into these incidents.</p>
      <p>“Officers are continuing to carry out patrols in this area and we are also liaising with the owners of the disused buildings in relation to improving the security of the site.”</p>
      <p>Police confirmed to Bridgend, Gannochy and Kinnoull Community Council that community officers would carry out extra patrols in the area, particularly after dark.</p>
      <p>The group’s treasurer Colin Styles said: “We know there have been problems at the site since the summer.</p>
      <p>“It seems that a lot of lead has been removed from the roof and damage has also been caused to the building.”</p>
      <p>He said: “We have not heard directly from the site’s owners, but police have told us they are looking to install CCTV.”</p>
      <p>Perth City Centre councillor Eric Drysdale added: “I know there has been concern locally about this, so I’m pleased to see that the police are taking action.”</p>
      <p>The building is at the centre of a planning row after owner Rivertree Residential lodged proposals to transform the historic building into 58 flats, with a further 70 homes planned for the hospital grounds.</p>
      <p>The multi-million-pound project came under fierce opposition from locals over concerns about its impact on already congested roads.</p>
      <p>Scottish Government ministers seized control of the planning application and an inquiry was held in June. A decision is expected to be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Rivertree Residential could not be reached for comment. The entrance to the site was recently sealed off with new fencing bearing ‘keep out’ and ‘private property’ signs.</p>
      <p>The building was first opened as Murray Royal Asylum in 1821 and was expanded twice in its first century.</p>
      <p>In October 2013, property group Ryden was commissioned to develop a masterplan for the site’s redevelopment.</p>
      <p>A series of public meetings were held to shape the project. There were concerns from council officers and Historic Scotland to suggestions that the hospital’s historic Heiton wings could be demolished.</p>
      <p>The replacement hospital was opened at a nearby site by then-First Minister Alex Salmond six years ago.</p>
