      <p>Finland picked its youngest citizen as prime minister on Sunday, December 8, after former transport minister, Sanna Marin, aged 34, won an election.</p>
      <p>The Straits Times reports that Marin's victory was a close margin, making her the replacement for the outgoing Antti Rinne who lost people's confidence with the way he handled postal strike.</p>
      <p><i>“We have a lot of work to do to rebuild trust,”</i> Marin said as she spoke to newsmen, parrying questions that had to do with her age.</p>
