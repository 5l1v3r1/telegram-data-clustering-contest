      <h1>Market Pulse on December 6th</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:09:28+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author">Olivier Rigot, EMC Gestion de Fortune</a></address>

        <b>S&amp;P 500 3145,91 +28,48.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The stock market is still very resilient, it touched very briefly last Tuesday the higher end of the range we mentionned in our previous comments as a price objective of the consolidation/correction we were in, before rebounding swiftly. Now the jury is out and time will tell if the market resumes its upward path or if the consolidation may continue somehow. Most of our indicators are hovering around the neutral + level and are not extreme enough in one way or another to make a precise forecast.</p>
