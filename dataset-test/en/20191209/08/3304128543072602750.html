      <h1>Cecafa – Harambee Stars Coach Francis Kimanzi Banned For ‘Unsporting Behaviour’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:31:44+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:31</time> by <a rel="author">Bonface Osano</a></address>
      <p>Harambee Stars coach Francis Kimanzi has been handed a two-match ban by the Organizing Committee of the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup for “unsporting behaviour.”</p>
      <p>His deputy Zedekiah “Zico” Otieno, on the other hand, has been “heavily reprimanded”, while the rest of the Kenyan delegation has been warned to behave.</p>
      <p>The regional tournament began over the weekend in Uganda with Kenya, who are the defending champions, edging out Tanzania 1-0, the goal scored by Bandari FC’s Abdallah Hassan in the fourth minute.</p>
      <p>According to the committee’s ruling Kimanzi and Zico were found guilty of chasing away fourth official, Mohamed Guedi, from the dressing room before the game at Lugogo Stadium, Kampala.</p>
      <p>They also incited players not to take to the pitch, alleging that some Tanzanian players did not have passports.</p>
      <p>During the protests, the door was broken leading to delay in kick-off by ten minutes, the committee reported.</p>
      <p>Kenya will next face Sudan on Tuesday before concluding their Group B games against Zanzibar on Saturday.</p>
