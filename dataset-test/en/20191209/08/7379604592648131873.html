Thanks for watching along with us, it's going to be a long 12 months until we see our fave celebs put through the seven circles of hell again. ITV's next big reality fix will come in the form of Winter Love Island – roll on January! Congrats again Jacqueline, you certainly earned the title of Jungle Queen.</li>

No idea who'll be at the helm next year, but these guys will be a tough act to follow. Safe journey home guys – and good luck with the jet lag!</li>

She still says she feels starstruck by her fellow celebs, despite winning the thing! Although she's fuming about having to hold a spider in her mouth in that last trial. She reckons it weed in her mouth. BRB, just need to go vom.</li>

He said earlier he was rooting for Jacqueline, so it's no surprise he's chuffed with the result. It also turns out show bosses got him bang to rights with his last Bushtucker trial – he just admitted he's claustrophobic! Guess being buried underground with snakes wasn't exactly a walk in the park then? He just broke down at his mum and dad's message from home. No, we're not crying too, we've just got something in our eye…</li>
