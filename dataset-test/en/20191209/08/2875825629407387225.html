      <p>Jacqueline Jossa's emotional reaction to winning I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 2019 touched hearts across the nation - not least because the mum of two had a mountain of issues to sort out with her husband minutes after the cameras were switched off.</p>
      <p>While she was in the jungle, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> has faced multiple allegations of cheating - all of which he's denied - with his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> co-star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-chloe-ayling-celebrity-big-13077500">Chloe Ayling</a> claiming he had a threesome with her and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-natalie-nunn-celebrity-big-13090053">Natalie Nunn</a> after a boozy night out.</p>
      <p>But it appeared nothing had been mentioned to Jac before she was announced as the new Queen of the Jungle, with her bursting into tears as she declared her love for her husband in front of Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.</p>

      <p>Shaking heavily with adrenaline and covering her face with her hands, Jacqueline said: "I love my family, I love Daniel, I love my kids."</p>
      <p>Earlier in the series, Jacqueline threatened to quit the show after co-star Myles Stephenson told her that he thought husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan</a> cheated on her with his ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> in unaired scenes.</p>
      <p>In an unprecedented move, bosses allowed Jacqueline to leave a voice message for Dan about what she had heard, and for him to leave one for her.</p>

      <p>But she was all smiles when Dan rushed down the walkway to hug her minutes after she was handed her jungle crown and sceptre.</p>
      <p>The ex-TOWIE hunk ran down to embrace his wife, smiling broadly for the cameras in the first glimpse of the couple's emotional reunion.</p>
      <p>And Jac seemed to be full of happiness as she saw her children for the first time in three weeks.</p>
      <p>She arrived at the Palazzo Versace hotel arm-in-arm with Dan, then broke into a run in the lobby and hugged Ella, four, and one-year-old Mia as cheers broke out from the awaiting crowd that had gathered to greet her.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline looked teary as she picked the children up and posed for a few photos before heading to her room for some well-earned rest.</p>
      <p>"It was a lot harder than I expected and I didn't expect it to be a turning point in life," she told Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I went in as one person and I have come out as a different person, growing in confidence and I have found who I am as a person a bit more."</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is expected to spend the next 24 hours with her kids and husband, and has even refused to do live TV interviews - making her the first I'm A Celeb winner in history not to agree to a sit-down chat with ITV.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted ITV for comment.</p>
