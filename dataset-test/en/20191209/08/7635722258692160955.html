        <b>The FAI is being invited to an emergency meeting of the Oireachtas Sport Committee on Wednesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes in the wake of the publication of the association's accounts last week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/fai-john-delaney-settlement-934461"><b>The accounts revealed</b></a> that the association's liabilities stand at over €55 million.</p>
      <p>Oireachtas Sports Committee chair Fergus O'Dowd said he will invite the FAI, Sports Minister Shane Ross and Sports Ireland to an emergency meeting this week:</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Minister Ross on Sunday evening committed to supporting grassroots football, despite the ongoing freezing of FAI funds.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said: "As repeatedly stated, funding to the FAI cannot be restored until they have completed a massive overhaul of their corporate governance and their leadership. However, I am committed to ensuring that players around the country do not suffer.</p>
      <p>"Earlier this week, I announced an alternative mechanism to ensure funding of €195,000 could be restored to our women’s national team.</p>
      <p>"We are now at an advanced stage of ensuring over €2 million can be channeled through an intermediary to fund our community based development officers and their programmes."</p>
      <p>Minister Ross added: "This will ensure grassroot football continues to be supported regardless on of our ongoing issues with the FAI."</p>
      <p>The FAI insisted on Sunday evening that its board remains available to meet with Minister Ross and the Sports Committee.</p>
