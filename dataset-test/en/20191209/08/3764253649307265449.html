        <b>Reports which has since surfaced on the internet suggests that American rap star, Cardi B was reportedly paid a whooping N1.8 billion to perform both in Lagos, Nigeria and Ghana.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a local new site, the vivacious star’s trip to Nigerian and Ghana cost about $5m dollars which translates to a whooping N1.8b.</p>
      <p>Sources revealed that the two countries budgeted about $2.5m each to secure the 27-year-old's visit to the countries for her music performance. The $2.5m (N906.2m) covers the performance fees per country and the production costs per country too.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, it seems the whole concert is not an initiative of Darey Art Alade and his wife Deola as widely speculated. Looks more like a type of collaboration and their brand were just in charge of production and all. Indeed stars don’t come cheap.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, following her much publicized visit to Nigeria, American rapper, Cardi B, recently touched down in Ghana for yet another musical concert. <a href="https://legit.ng/1282655-cardi-b-ghanaian-celebrities-disappointed-rapper-snubs-them.html">However, she seemed to have pissed off certain Ghanaian celebrities.</a></p>
      <p>The rapper who was supposed to be with them for a meet and greet, failed to show up, keeping them waiting for over six hours. Comedian Afia Schwarzenegger who was one of those invited, wasted no time in showing her displeasure.</p>
