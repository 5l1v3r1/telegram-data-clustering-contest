      <p>A case has been opened against five Chinese citizens for attacking local authorities with iron bars and swords while the latter were trying to ask them to move their parked car in front of a house in Hlaingthaya Township. </p>
      <p>In connection with the case, Khin Myint, the owner of a flat in FMI City Housing phoned Aung Kyaw Moe, the administrator of Ward No.4 in Hlaingthaya Township, about a parked car in front of her flat. Then, the administrator sought help from the township police station at about 7.45 pm on December 7. </p>
      <p>"The case happened at 7.45 pm. Some Chinese citizens living in the same housing parked their car in front of another's flat, even blocking traffic on the road. When we got there, four Chinese men came out of their flat. They were drunk at that time. We explained to them through a person that could speak Chinese. We asked them not park their car recklessly. We asked them for their documents but they didn't provide any. Then, another man came from outside. He was also drunk. When we explained to them, a fight broke out. They attacked five of us with sticks and swords. We were injured but not in serious conditions, said the administrator, who filed the case at the police station. </p>
      <p>The Chinese men also used abusive language despite requested not to do so through the interpreter. </p>
      <p>Hlaingthaya Police Station filed a lawsuit against the five Chinese men for attacking the authorities.    </p>
