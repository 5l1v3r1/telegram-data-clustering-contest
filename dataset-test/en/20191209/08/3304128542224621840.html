      <p>Kenyaâ€™s second-largest telco Airtel has launched non-expiry data, months after its rival Safaricom launched a similar product.</p>
      <p>In the new plan, 5MB of data will cost Ksh1, and a Ksh2 call rate across all networks will be applied.</p>
      <p>Unlike the traditional method, subscribers will not be required to buy data bundles, but will have to subscribe to the service with no conditions, according to the telco.</p>
      <p>According to Prasanta Das Sarma, CEO Airtel Kenya, the service comes as a game changer in the market for subscribers who complain of data and airtime expiry.</p>

      <p>Safaricom launched its non-expiry data and airtime on October 23, after a public outcry concerning the expiry of the two.</p>
      <p>Previously, a lawyer and ICT practitioner Adrian Kamotho had dragged Safaricom, Telkom, Airtel to court over the expiry of data bundles.</p>
      <p>Also on the list of respondents is the industry regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA).</p>
      <p>The demands intensified after all telecommunication companies in Ghana were directed by the government to do away with expiry of data bundles and airtime, a practice that is common in most countries.</p>
      <p>Ghana has four major telecommunication companies which include MTN, Vodafone, Airtel Tigo and Glo, and all will be affected by the directive.</p>
