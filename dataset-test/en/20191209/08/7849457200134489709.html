      <p>“It is an Environmental Sanitation initiative of Quezon Provincial DOH Office in meeting the target in the Philippine Sustainable Sanitation Sector Roadmap by 2025 for water (100 percent) and by 2028 for sanitation (100 percent),” he added.</p>

      <p>The DOH- Calabarzon said the “Gintong DALOY” project “calls for the provision of incentives for Zero Open Defecation (ZOD) communities with effective hygiene promotion and advocacy on environmental sanitation.”</p>
      <p>“It also aims to raise awareness on the importance of sanitation, encourage LGUs to promote and implement policies and actions to meet sanitation target and to mobilize communities towards changing sanitation and hygiene practices through sanitation-health-education campaign,” it added.</p>
