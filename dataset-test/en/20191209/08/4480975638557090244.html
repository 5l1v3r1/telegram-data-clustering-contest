      <h1>GBP/USD: A close above 1.3187 is pivotal – Commerzbank</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:02:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>In the view of Karen Jones, an analyst at Commerzbank, the GBP/USD pair is looking northwards on the UK election, with the bias to be confirmed on a close above 1.3187 May high.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“GBP/USD last week reached its 5-year downtrend at 1.3156. Also found in this vicinity is the 50% retracement of the move down from 2018 at 1.3167 and the 1.3187 May high and this is tough <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> and we look for the market to fail here. We note the daily RSI has not confirmed the new high.</p>
      <p>Minor support is offered by 1.3013 October high and the 20-day ma at 1.2951 and this guards the 1.2768 8th November low. Failure at 1.2768 would probably see a slide to the 200-day ma at 1.2696. This guards the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">1.2582</a> September high. Below 1.2582 lies the 1.2584 uptrend line. It guards 1.2196/94.</p>
      <p>A close above 1.3187 will open the way to the 1.3382 2019 high and potentially the 61.8% retracement at 1.3450.”</p>
