      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- At least one person is dead and several others are missing after a volcano on a small New Zealand island erupted Monday, authorities said.</p>
      <p>New Zealand Police said<a href="https://www.facebook.com/NZPolice/photos/a.654738734660113/1810749105725731/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBUXuZ2ChxV9NYjzsOBijo8J8E8iks9Vx4AXPOVbxWWahhuUfqLmsURRAWYAzX-F3yLmoEShcW7uoTjc_fbgWvb5eEDh_pfVrR_FlOSEBZQ9WgQSskgnG9f89G2uHq747DXMj5Saz2JDWibuv1QCnyd-b3YrZM-45osm1tCKzQrnxzmbzpKnc2yY13iiQGh8ezoaNzY0FOGlSHnfjFhbhPU5E2nw4ytewRSzdTmosvy0bgJbHvzsK0EbTk_Hu5OQbbb7yQg7T0FUOhugF80lwhPewWfMIjfq7ewXXAIYOV9roZ2C79BWHW6nR9ortQfVS5VZGVZKkhGECRpPT5TY0VPMw&amp;__tn__=-R"> it believes</a> there were fewer than 50 people on or near White Island when it erupted and at least one of them has died though it expects the death toll to rise as several people are still unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>"At this stage, we can confirm there has been one fatality, and based on the information we have, it is likely there are others," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Some of the injured have been transported from the island to Whakatane and Middlemore hospitals on the mainland and search and rescue crews were working to "confirm the numbers of those involved," it said. "The island is currently covered in ash and we are taking expert advice with regards to the conditions to determine when we can [safely] access the island."</p>
      <p>New Zealand Police said that both New Zealanders and overseas tourists are believed to be involved.</p>
      <p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that Australians are among those who were on the island and is working "to determine their well being."</p>
      <p>"I have been in touch with [New Zealand Prime Minister] Jacinda Ardern to offer our full support with whatever they need and our authorities are working closely together," Morrison said v<a href="https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1203932820961284096">ia Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>It was originally reported that 100 tourists were visiting the island when the volcano erupted, but police later decreased that number to 50.</p>
      <p>St John Ambulance said in <a href="https://www.stjohn.org.nz/News--Info/News-Articles/white-island-eruption/">a statement</a> that up to 20 people were injured and a mobile triage unit has been dispatched.</p>
      <p>The volcano on White Island erupted at 2:11 p.m., <a href="https://www.geonet.org.nz/vabs/4TA6UkHTyIQchYcjnSYk80">GeoNet said</a>, describing the eruption as a "shortlived event" that generated an ash plume up to 12,000 feet above the vent.</p>
      <p>The service decreased its Volcanic Alert Level from an initial reading of a 4 to a 3 on its 5-point scale, meaning it is a minor volcanic eruption posing a threat only near its vent.</p>
      <p>"We do not expect more than a minor amount of ash to reach East Cape in the coming hours," Duty Volcanologist Geoff Kilgour said in <a href="https://www.geonet.org.nz/news/4TA6UkHTyIQchYcjnSYk80">a statement</a>, adding "we are aware that people were on the island immediately before the eruption and we express our concern for their safety."</p>
      <p>Ardern said during <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12292248">a press conference</a> that police search and rescue was working with the National Emergency Management Agency to assist with the operation.</p>
      <p>"All our thoughts are with those affected at this stage," she said</p>
      <p>The National Emergency Management Agency said <a href="https://twitter.com/NZcivildefence/status/1203860948194168832?s=20">it was</a> assessing the situation to determine the severity of the threat, advising the public to seek safety information from local emergency services and to "act on it promptly."</p>
      <p>The New Zealand Police issued a warning for those living in or near ashfall areas to stay indoors.</p>
      <p>"If caught in volcanic ashfalls: Wear a dust mask or use a cloth handkerchief over your nose and mouth; protect your eyes by wearing goggles. Wear eyeglasses, NOT contact lenses as fine ash will get under the lens," it said in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NZPolice/photos/a.654738734660113/1810659152401393/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA_zxm-0Xe4N1w1d_5faD6DIfPAkdczQkX9xy4GObVB9ocoo8nPR_V8pabd8rNeV3XExdC-XiAyfPuvrWUIxQkrg1v1tZndrRcOlmbGUKibfv483e0s8Sp7N5ZN0F-_OTkhNxNW2dlJl_2yq-PloO14al_6Z_5XSIY-32pgdC1v5ikKr3HINcR8mPP7XR2Z4wDw4nlhlP0iaJPWX7JTpyOet5i41eZh7TXQYDB95BBKCmTBL_5EjPnj0Mnxy_yoiRq-16LZfAra2Yfurrf-H0C_0T7V8VAPUfjiFji4VDvdYRiED67NWWw7rcv_7PJqQ-H7wPuFOk2EbO_CrFNRi43mng&amp;__tn__=-R">an advisory</a>.</p>
      <p>Known locally as Whakaari Island, the privately-owned White Island is home to the most active cone volcano in the nation and is visited by more than 10,000 people on day tours a year, according <a href="https://www.geonet.org.nz/about/volcano/whiteisland">to GeoNet</a>.</p>
