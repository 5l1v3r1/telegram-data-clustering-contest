      </p>
      <p>It was another memorable night for the Catalan giants at the Camp Nou, where they thrashed newly-promoted side Mallorca 5-2, inspired by yet another terrific performance from Messi.</p>
      <p>The Argentine struck three times for the Blaugrana, including two goals from outside the box, while Antoine Griezmann and Luis Suarez also got on the scoresheet with great finishes of their own.</p>
      <p>When the score was 1-1, there seemed to be an off-the-ball issue between Mallorca's manager and Messi, who was caught from behind just in front of the opposition's technical area near the halfway line.</p>

      <p>With the 32-year-old appearing to ask the match official for a yellow card to be shown for the challenge, Moreno had some heated words with Messi for a few seconds.</p>
      <p>While it is not clear what was said between the pair, Moreno explained after the game that the Barca captain must be treated the same as everybody else.</p>
      <p>"There are some players who are in a bubble and you can't reason with them," he said, according to <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"He's a different player in some respects, and then in other ways he is a person just like any other and has to be treated as such.</p>
      <p>"The referee was telling him it wasn't a foul and he didn't see it that way.</p>
      <p>"There's no need to place more importance on it than that."</p>

      <p>Messi's hat-trick ensured he has <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/lionel-messi-breaks-cristiano-ronaldo-record-2/669030">broken Cristiano Ronaldo's record of LaLiga trebles</a>, and he is also now the leading goalscorer in the league this season, with 12 goals in 10 games so far.</p>
