      <p>The 45-year-old suffered serious injuries in the accident at the Balfour Beatty site in January.</p>
      <p>The UK Government’s Health and Safety Executive confirmed it had finished investigating the circumstances of the accident.</p>
      <p>A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Our contractor for the A9 Dualling: Luncarty to Birnam project, Balfour Beatty, has confirmed that an HSE investigation for the incident which occurred on site on January 7 has concluded with no further action required.”</p>
      <p>He said: “Transport Scotland and its contractors place the utmost importance on protecting the safety of the local community, road users and operatives.”</p>
      <p>A source with knowledge of the accident said the employee was working with others to set up cabins at the temporary construction village near Bankfoot.</p>
      <p>The cabin was being moved into position by a crane when the machinery malfunctioned and dropped the unit on to the worker.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended and the man was rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>It is understood he made good recovery, after receiving specialist treatment at a private hospital in Manchester, however Transport Scotland said it could not comment on his status.</p>
      <p>Balfour Beatty deferred all enquiries about the investigation to Transport Scotland.</p>
      <p>The accident happened as the company was setting up its base for work on the next stage of the £3 billion dualling project.</p>
      <p>The work involved a new bridge at the Stanley/Tullybelton junction, to the north of Perth.</p>
      <p>Fifteen concrete beams, weighing between 49 and 57 tonnes, were swung into place over the carriageway during a series of overnight closures.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Transport Secretary Michael Matheson visited the site to check out construction on the £96 million phase and meet staff and trainees.</p>
      <p>He said: “As Scotland’s largest infrastructure project, the A9 dualling programme offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a legacy the industry can be proud of.”</p>
