      <p>Looks like "<a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/12/03/the-most-disturbing-horror-fil.html">Grace from Boston</a>" has fallen on some hard times. It's not clear if she's pounding back that smooth Aviation gin <i>during</i> her year-long exercise binge, or after she realizes that her <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/12/06/actor-who-played-husband-in-pe.html">husband</a>'s seeming-generosity is actually some terrifying <a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy/status/1202726912239341573">voyeurism</a>. But at least she has some friends looking out for her, right?</p>
      <p>(Also, props to this actress and to Aviation gin for getting this out so fast)</p>
