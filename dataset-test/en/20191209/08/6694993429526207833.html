      <p>Raheem Sterling put aside his disappointment at losing the Manchester derby by throwing a birthday party on Sunday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Sterling,</a> 25, hosted a Great Gatsby-themed event at the Hilton Hotel in Manchester, with plenty of his <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> teammates dressing in 1920's style to join him.</p>
      <p>The City and England winger posed with fiancee Paige Milian on Sunday to celebrate his birthday, and the squad seemed in good spirits despite falling to defeat against <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> at the Etihad a day earlier.</p>
      <p>Sterling is enjoying a fine season, with 19 goals and 12 assists in 27 appearances for City and <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> already. He has also been nominated for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.</p>
      <p>Dressed in an all-white suit with a long coat over his shoulders and a cane in his hand, Sterling welcomed guests including many of the City squad.</p>
      <p>Injured players Leroy Sane and Aymeric Laporte were present, while John Stones - who limped off the field in the derby - turned up with winger Bernardo Silva.</p>
      <p>Ederson, Rodri, Fernandinho and Gabriel Jesus were all pictured with their partners, with Kyle Walker, Ilkay Gundogan and Nicolas Otamendi also seen arriving at the party.</p>
