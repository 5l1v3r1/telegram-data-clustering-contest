        <b>A few privileged Marvel fans were treated to a first look at The Eternals this weekend, giving fans a glimpse at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/angelina-jolie/">Angelina Jolie</a> and Salma Hayek’s characters.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kevin Feige hosted a panel at Comic-Con in Sao Paolo on Saturday where he unveiled a fresh look at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/03/avengers-scarlett-johansson-makes-mighty-return-first-black-widow-trailer-11259395/">Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow, after the officially trailer dropped</a> last week.</p>
      <p>But it was The Eternals preview which had everyone talking as it’s been kept tightly under wraps since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/21/impressive-eternals-line-announced-marvel-confirms-angelina-jolie-salma-hayek-richard-madden-10433320/">news of the movie broke earlier this year.</a></p>
      <p>And while the first look footage still isn’t available for the wider public, a group of lucky Comic-Con attendees were able to watch a short clip at Feige’s panel.</p>
      <p>According <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvels-kevin-feige-unveils-first-eternals-footage-1260540">to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Feige arrived on-stage to a chorus of chants ‘Kevin, Kevin, Kevin!’ The Marvel studio boss then joked: ‘It’s much more exciting in person,’ as he’s only ever appeared at the convention via video link.</p>
      <p>The filmmaker then announced: ‘It fills me with immense gratitude we were able to finish Avengers: Endgame and you all came out and made it a big success.</p>
      <p>‘It’s exciting because now we get to talk about what’s coming next.’</p>

      <p>Introducing The Eternals footage, Feige said: ‘This is raw footage, just pulled out of the camera.</p>
      <p>‘This will not be released online.’</p>
      <p>The clip opens with Druid (Barry Keoghan) welcoming The Eternals: Thena (Angelina Jolie), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Sprite (Lia McHugh).</p>
      <p>Druid says: ‘Make yourselves at home.’</p>

      <p>According <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/12/marvel-studios-kevin-feige-disney-plus-the-eternals-black-widow-ccxp-1202803059/">to Deadline</a>, it then shows a blonde Angelina ‘kicking some major a*s’ during a huge fight scene and frankly, we wouldn’t expect anything less.</p>
      <p>The rest of the characters are then shown in different parts of the world before the footage closes with Salma’s character Ajak stating: ‘This world has changed us. We must protect it.’</p>
      <p>THR also reports that there were shots of a ‘monster army’ who are believed to be rival group The Deviants.</p>
      <p>It’ll be Angelina’s first time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Recalling what it was like to get that phonecall, Ange previously said at D23: ‘I am actually a big fan of the Marvel universe and everything [Feige has] done and what all the other artists have done, so when you get the call that you might be joining, you feel like you’ve been called up for service, it’s very exciting in fact.</p>
      <p>‘You’re just wondering, “What colour am I gonna be? And what power do I have?” And you’re still a little confused. It’s still new for me, so I’m learning.’</p>
