      <p>In what was a bizarre incident, the start of a Ranji Trophy match between Vidarbha and Andhra on Monday was delayed by a few minutes after a snake entered the ground in Vijayawada.</p>
      <p>Vidarbha captain Faiz Fazal, whose team are chasing a third successive Ranji Trophy crown, won the toss and elected to field. However, as the players made their way to the middle, a snake was spotted on the field and it resulted in a delay of few minutes.</p>
      <p>“Snake stops play! There was a visitor on the field to delay the start of the match,” BCCI Domestic tweeted a 13-second video. The official Twitter handle of BCCI Domestic posted a video where the snake can be seen gliding on the field while seven to eight groundsmen trying to ensure that it slithers away.</p>
