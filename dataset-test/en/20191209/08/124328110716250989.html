      <p>The short garment also offered a look at her tanned and toned pins, which she elongated with a pair of tan suede boots. </p>
      <p>Kate completed the look with a chunky silver watch and bangles, whilst her glossy golden locks were swept away from her face. </p>

      <p>Kate, who finished in fourth place on this year's I'm A Celebrity, had already lost two stone prior to entering the jungle, taking her total recent weight loss up to a whopping three stone.  </p>
      <p>Yet the mother-of-two was taken aback by her shock 14lb weight loss in just three weeks in the jungle, telling The Mirror: 'I was a bit shocked when I got into the dressing room and looked in the mirror. </p>
      <p>'I thought "Oh, my God!" because you don't see yourself. There is no mirror in the jungle.</p>

      <p>'They weigh you before you go in and they weigh you when you come out and I've lost a stone… I was really eating in there as well, so rice and beans is kind of the way to go.' </p>
      <p>Kate was said to have overhauled her lifestyle to get jungle ready and prepare for the iconic shower scenes - for which she packed a tiny bikini.</p>
      <p>Her shower scenes came following her two stone weight loss following a rigorous diet plan which included swimming, yoga and cutting down on alcohol and sugar.</p>

      <p>The star started by sacrificing her Saturday morning full English breakfast, replacing it with healthy and protein-rich poached eggs and avocado.</p>
      <p>She also ditched her pre-8am chocolate snacks, telling Fit &amp; Well last year: 'Because of the crazy shifts I do , I regulated my energy with sugar bursts.</p>
      <p>'I didn't think I ate a lot of sugar but by 8am, I'd always had lots of chocolate. Now I eat avocados obsessively. Having avocados and and low-sugar foods help keep my energy levels up.' </p>

      <p>Kate added: 'I stopped drinking caffeine and now I eat avocados obsessively because I found one of the diets was high in good fat, medium protein and zero sugar – which is a bit extreme for me.</p>
      <p>The star also recently told Closer Magazine she was inspired to cut down on alcohol after tests revealed she had fat around her liver. She started with quitting alcohol for a month before limiting herself to one drink at events.</p>
      <p>'I thought I didn't drink that much but when you stop completely it is a shocker. You realise that a glass here, going to a function there, it all adds up.'</p>
