      <h2>The Spanish manager lost his job earlier this month following the Gunners' dreadful run of form but reports suggest his departure was not as acrimonious as first thought</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:53:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:53</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery reportedly received support from a number of senior <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> players from past and present after he was sacked from the club.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was relieved of his duties the day after the Gunners' loss to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League last month, and the team are still without a win in any competition since their victory against Vitoria in October.</p>
      <p>There were suggestions that Emery had lost the support of the dressing room and was effectively driven out of the club by the players, but according to <a href="https://trello.com/c/s3CygY2n/55720-unai-emery-received-support-from-mesut-ozil-and-laurent-koscielny-after-arsenal-sacking">The Athletic</a> he was visited in his office by all members of the first-team squad before he departed.</p>

      <p>This somewhat surprisingly included Mesut Ozil, even though it was widely thought that he and Emery had fallen out, with the midfielder regularly left out of the squad for games.</p>
      <p>It is also believed that former Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny sent Emery a message after his sacking, despite the acrimonious nature in which he left the club for Bordeaux in the summer.</p>
      <p>Overall it is believed that although the majority of the squad felt the decision to sack Emery was the correct one, they did not have any ill feeling towards him, and all wished him well before he left the training ground for the final time.</p>
      <p>Emery himself also respected the class shown by the club even though he was surprised by his sacking, and said in a statement after the decision: "To all the fans, I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for helping me to understand and feel the greatness of Arsenal.</p>

      <p>"To all of you who have supported us from every corner of the globe, all of you who have come to the Emirates, all of you who have waited in the rain and cold just to greet me after a game.</p>
      <p>"I want to tell all of you that I have worked with passion, with commitment and with effort. I would have liked nothing more than to have achieved better results for you."</p>
