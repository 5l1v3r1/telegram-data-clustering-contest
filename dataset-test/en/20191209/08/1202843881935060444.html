      <p>Manateq (Economic Zone Company-Qatar) announced yesterday at a press conference that it has awarded the Al Wukair Logistics Park development project to Gulf Warehousing Company (GWC), Qatar’s leading logistics provider.</p>
      <p>Under the agreement singed yesterday, GWC will Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) the development of the 1.48 square kilometer Al Wukair Logistics Park in a public-private-partnership deal with a 30-year lease tenure, and an investment value of QR1.5bn</p>
      <p>Manateq is a national initiative to diversify Qatar’s economy by providing premium infrastructure within strategic economic zones, logistics parks and industrial complexes in line with the country’s long term vision.</p>
      <p>The contract, which was subject to competitive bid, will allow GWC to design, finance, develop, operate and maintain the entire development, consisting of dry, cold, frozen and chemical storage facilities as well as light workshops and warehousing open yards. In addition, the Park will provide comprehensive solutions that include retail outlets, workers’ accommodation, first air clinic and a mosque. Clients of the new Al Wukair Logistics Park will also benefit directly from GWC’s 15 years of local, regional, and international logistics experience providing the highest standards of quality and solutions for clients in every industry.</p>
      <p>“This award, on a BOT basis, confirms our commitment to engaging the private sector in national change and economic diversification and progression,” said Fahad Rashid Al Kaabi, CEO of Manateq.  “Al Wukair facilities will be built in a variety of sizes catering to small, medium and large enterprises giving all, from start-ups to established brands, the opportunity to benefit from the logistics park’s investment incentives.”</p>
      <p>Work on the park is set to begin immediately with a first phase representing almost 40% of the park due for completion within two years, with the remainder due to be developed within five years.</p>
      <p>“GWC is proud to be entrusted with developing the country’s logistics infrastructure while setting a new benchmark for logistics excellence that is adopted internationally,” said GWC Chairman Sheikh Abdulla bin Fahad bin Jassem bin Jabor Al Thani. “This partnership with Manateq shall boost the growing local economy across all segments by offering best in class platform to developing and established enterprises, feeding into the actualisation of Qatar National Vision 2030 tenets of becoming a sustainable and diverse economy.”</p>
      <p>This is the second such PPP that GWC has entered with Manateq, after having completed the first such project Bu Sulba Warehousing Park, on schedule, in the end of 2016. The experience of developing this hub, in addition to its 1 million square meter Logistics Village Qatar, the largest such development in the region, will ensure the development of an integrated logistics park catering to all segments of the market, and potentially a wide array of industry sectors.</p>
      <p>“We appreciate manateq’s confidence in GWC, and believe our second partnership with them can bolster the gold standard we are setting in the market,” Stated GWC Group CEO Mr. Ranjeev Menon. “Our deep, hard-earned knowledge of the local market will make GWC Al Wukair Logistics Park the ideal location for businesses to avail and enjoy of the best logistics infrastructure that will allow them to focus on their core businesses and reap the benefits of this flourishing economy.”</p>
      <p>Manateq’s logistic parks, which have been designed to accelerate the economy through enabling businesses to invest in a diverse range of sectors such as aluminium, steel, automotive, electronics, construction material, and food &amp; beverage, by offering around 15 million square metres, distributed across Jery Al Samur, Al Wakra, Birkat Al Awamer and Aba Saleel, to promote the economic diversification.</p>
      <p>Al Wukair Logistics Park is the fifth logistics park Manateq has put forward to significantly contribute to Qatar’s economy and the development of the vibrant private sector and a diversified knowledge-based economy in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>
