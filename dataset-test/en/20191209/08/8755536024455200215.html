      <p>Many fans are speculating that the Love Island star is launching her own swimwear brand.</p>

      <p>Others speculate that she may be launching a lifestyle brand, or an official website about her life.</p>
      <p>Along that vein, it has been suggested that she could be creating her own filters and social media presets, so that fans can create online content just like hers.</p>
      <p>Molly’s brand is being supported by her Love Island co-stars, with Maura Higgins and boyfriend Tommy Fury sharing the link to her new project.</p>
      <p>The brand will launch officially on Wednesday.</p>
