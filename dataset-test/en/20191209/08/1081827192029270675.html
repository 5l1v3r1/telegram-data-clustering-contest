      <p>There’s nothing quite like getting your Christmas tree out of its box (or purchasing a real one), <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/worst-christmas-songs/">popping on some Mariah Carey</a> and decorating your home with twinkling lights and brightly coloured baubles.</p>
      <p>Unless you’re Kim Kardashian West, in which case a traditional green tree with tinsel would totally ruin <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/kim-kardashian-kanye-house/">your very, very minimalist decor (and by decor we mean… empty space)</a>.</p>
      <p>Kim gave her Instagram followers a look at her Christmas decorations over the weekend, and the biggest question was… <i>What are those?</i></p>
      <p>“I love these. They’re so whimsical, like Whoville, but all white,” she narrated videos on her Instagram stories, while showing us these:</p>

      <p>Sure, it could be Whoville, the colourful, festive town from Dr. Seuss' <i>The Grinch Who Stole Christmas</i>. If Whoville has been ravaged by bleach.</p>
      <p>Now, naturally, Kim's interesting interpretation of 'festive' has raised a number of questions for well, everyone. Let's see...</p>
      <h3>1. What are they made out of?</h3>
      <p>They look like the sorts of toilet paper dresses we make a bachelorette parties.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Ellayyyyee/status/1203015035762569216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>They also could be constructed from q-tips or cotton balls, and actually... do you know what else is often made from cotton?</p>
      <h3>2. Are they giant tampons?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>I see no difference.</p>
      <h3>3. Where do Kim and Kanye put their presents?</h3>
      <p>There's no doubt North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm West will get some sweet Christmas gifts, but having seen Kim's decorations we have to wonder, where the heck do they put them?</p>
      <p>(Side note: What would KKW Christmas wrapping paper look like?)</p>
      <p>Besides the tampon forest, Kim and Kanye also have this - again, all white - Christmas tree. But there's a problem.</p>
      <p>Usually, Christmas trees have just trunk or base at the bottom so there's room to fit delightfully wrapped toys and <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/cadbury-favourites-ranked/">Cadbury Favourites boxes</a> at the bottom. We... don't see one here.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
      <h3>4. What do Kim and Kanye have against colour?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://mamamia.com.au/kim-kardashian-home/">Kim and Kanye love beige, and white, and cream</a>. We're not sure if those are colours or just<i> shades</i>, but either way Kimye are big fans.</p>
      <p>The one or two items of furniture in their house fit this colour (or non-colour) scheme, and now so do their 'decorations' but... it's<i> Christmas.</i></p>
      <p>Just buy the coloured baubles.</p>
      <h3>5. Are spiders going to crawl out and takeover their home?</h3>
      <p>The decorations look remarkably like the creepy egg sacks spiders lay which means in two to three weeks time, Kim's home looks like it will be infested.</p>

      <p>We're hoping she doesn't share follow up videos of when that happens.</p>
      <h3>6. Wait. Don't they also look like... other things?</h3>
      <p>A selection of vox pop answers from around the <i>Mamamia</i> office:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Those are definitely sex toys, right?"</li>
        <li>"Have they padded their walls?"</li>
        <li>"Is that a standard amount of toilet paper for a family of six?"</li>
        <li>"Has she bleached cacti?"</li>
        <li>"Is Kim K holding Olaf hostage?"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you still haven't got around to putting up your own decorations, maybe you can take some inspiration from the Wests.</p>
      <p>Besides, it's probably a good money saver: All you need is toilet paper.</p>
