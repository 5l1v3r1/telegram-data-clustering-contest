      <p>Even though she was five months pregnant, the victim was completely trashed and left by the road dripping with blood.</p>
      <p>Reported in <a href="https://www.hmetro.com.my/mutakhir/2019/09/493966/remaja-mengandung-dibelasah-pakwe">Harian Metro</a>, the 18-year-old teen was tortured by her own boyfriend, also 18, along with his two friends in the alley behind Vocational College Setapak, Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>The victim was left alone with her weak and bleeding body. She finally reached a store near Wangsa Sari People’s Housing Project (PPR) around 2.30 am and received help there.</p>
      <p>The Wangsa Maju Deputy Chief Officer, Superintendent Rajab Ahad Ismail, said that the worker was reluctant to send her to a hospital, so he gathered up the people in the neighbourhood.<br/>“The residents then decided to call her family members first, informing them of the incident before sending her to Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) for treatment.”<br/>According to an investigation, the victim’s boyfriend had picked her up with a bike at 9.30 pm to go to Uptown Danau Kota.</p>
      <p>“They would usually use a different road but the suspect made an excuse saying that he was trying to ‘avoid roadblock’ before heading to the alley behind a college.”</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the two were blocked by a man, who asked them to pull over before dragging the victim off motorcycle and beat her up badly.</p>
      <p>“The victim’s face was swollen and she had a lot of injuries on the top part of her head.”</p>

      <p>“The victim’s father also came to make a police report.”</p>
      <p>Rajab continued that through the report, they managed to identify the suspects and apprehended all three of them for further investigation.</p>
      <p>“They admitted that they had to beat the victim up because she kept on pressuring the suspect to take responsibility for her 5-month-old pregnancy.”</p>
      <p>“Further investigation will be done according to Section 324 Penal Code and will be referred to the deputy public prosecutor for the next action,” he continued</p>
      <p>
        <i>What happened to humanity and responsibility? The suspect literally just got himself into bigger trouble not taking responsibility for his own actions.</i>
