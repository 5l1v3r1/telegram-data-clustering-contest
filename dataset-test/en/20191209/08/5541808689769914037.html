      <p>All-black everything - and this isn't about rapper Jay-Z's celebratory line from the song Run This Town.</p>
      <p>Simphiwe Dana Symphony Experience on Saturday night at the South African State Theatre in Pretoria boasted an all-black musical team.</p>
      <p>From the 60-piece orchestra to the 30-piece choir and 12-piece dance troupe.</p>
      <p>Even the Gothic glamour David Tlale frock that Dana closed the show in was black.</p>
      <p>The concert also featured an all-female band that included bass guitarist Tebogo "Aus Tebza" Sedumedi as well as musical conductor Titi Luzipho.</p>
      <p>Dana was supported by songbirds Daym√© Arocena from Cuba and the US-based Rwandan artist Somi. They both brought high-octane energy and female power with psychedelic funk and soul.</p>
      <p>"It's my first time in Africa. You cannot imagine what I'm feeling because I have always been in touch with my [African] roots and embraced them," Arocena said.</p>
      <p>"Since my international career started, I have always wondered, 'why have I never been to Africa?' Thank you to Simphiwe Dana for making it all possible."</p>
      <p>Before Dana closed the show with an electric rendition of Ndiredi, she walked onto the stage hand-in-hand with rising Port Elizabeth star Ami Faku.</p>
      <p>They teamed up for an emotionally charged duet of the 26-year-old supernova's song Inde Lendlela.</p>

      <p>The penultimate moment was a highlight of all the supporting acts that were featured. As the two singers belted out the song, it felt like Dana was handing over the reins to Faku.</p>
      <p>Make no mistake about it, it was Dana's party. She proved she is not only the greatest vocalist of our generation but a great performer as well.</p>
      <p>Her voice was excellent and her stage presence came effortlessly. Dana let the music speak for itself.</p>
      <p>"There were many times I thought I will never see the sun again and then my friends, family and fans reminded me I should be here," Dana said.</p>
      <p>The concert was choreographed like a performance art piece from the beginning to the end. Every second of it was carefully deliberated, and there was never a production glitch or sound error.</p>
      <p>It's also admirable that with so many elements on stage, Dana stood out as the centrepiece and never blended in the background.</p>
      <p>The music was a journey of her illustrious career. Some parts were nostalgic as she paid homage to Miriam Makeba with Malaika and Jonas Gwangwa with Flowers of a Nation.</p>
      <p>It got political on Bantu Biko Street. She took it back to church on Inkwenkwezi. In the middle, she gave fans a peek of the future with new song Zabalaza from her upcoming album Bamako.</p>
