        <b>The book accuses Raila of playing tricks on NASA co-principals</b>
      </p>
      <p>Opposition leader Raila Odinga has spoken on Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi’s new book, <i>Soaring Above the Storms of Passion.</i></p>
      <p>Speaking to Nation, Odinga said that Mudavadi is suffering from memory lapses and if other NASA co-principals were asked they would give a very different account.</p>
      <p>He went on to say that Mudavadi’s book only says things only he knows.</p>
      <p><i>“I really don’t want to discuss Mudavadi’s book mostly because he suffers from serious memory lapses from the claims he is making. I mean when you speak candidly to other Nasa principals over the swearing-in ceremony, they will give you the true picture and not what Musalia is saying. To me he suffers from memory lapses and has stuck to the gospel according to St Musalia Mudavadi,</i>” reads an excerpt from Daily Nation.</p>

        <p>The former Prime Minister’s words come a few days after Mudavadi in his book accused Raila of playing tricks on his co-principals during 2017 post-election happenings.</p>
        <p>Mudavadi’s memoir corroborated some of what had already been written by exiled Kenyan activist Miguna Miguna who was part of Odinga’s team in the aftermath of August 2017 General Election.</p>
        <p>The book paints Odinga as a man under pressure, who was willing to play tricks on both friend and foe to overcome the difficult situation before him.</p>
