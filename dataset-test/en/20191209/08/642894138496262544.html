      <h1>2019 Science Forum shines spotlight on local tech</h1>

      <p>The Science Forum South Africa (SFSA), the annual event organised by the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), remains a relevant platform for debate, says minister Blade Nzimande.</p>
      <p>This year’s SFSA was merged with the Innovation Bridge (IB) technology matchmaking and showcase event and held under the theme “Igniting conversations about science for innovation with impact".</p>
      <p>Hosted at the CSIR International Convention Centre last week, the joint SFSA-IB welcomed more than 2 400 attendees who discussed topics ranging from development of a culture of innovation, funding challenges for innovators, ethical matters related to genetics and genomics, the future of work under the fourth industrial revolution, climate change and infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Nzimande notes the merging of the two events has enriched the science, technology and innovation discourse.</p>
      <p>He says the forum had a strong focus on the commercialisation of research to benefit broader society with local technologies generated from publicly financed research and development.</p>
      <p>“We believe our Science Forum is a powerful instrument and platform for science diplomacy and we are therefore grateful for the support we enjoy from the United Nations system, especially UNESCO.”</p>

      <p>According to a statement, the 2019 event was an opportunity to showcase local technologies developed at publicly funded institutions. A number of DSI entities also had exhibition stalls, including the Technology Innovation Agency.</p>
      <p>North West University has developed the Neu Hand, which is a low-cost, hand-wearable robotic device for supplementary rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients.</p>
      <p>“The device provides a series of hand movement exercises that can be tailored to suit a wide range of patient needs. The lightweight frame and portability of the device allow the patient flexibility in choosing when and where to use the device. A built-in connectivity platform can link to external devices for better monitoring of patient progress,” notes the statement.</p>
