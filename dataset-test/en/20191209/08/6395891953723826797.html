      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - German exports posted a second consecutive month-on-month increase in October, defying economists' expectations of a slight decline.</p>
      <p>The Federal Statistical Office said Monday that exports rose 1.2% compared with the previous month. That followed a 1.5% increase in September.</p>
      <p>In year-on-year terms, exports were up 1.9%, led by a 4.6% rise in demand from countries outside the European Union. Exports to other EU nations rose only 0.1%.</p>
      <p>German imports were flat compared with September and down 0.6% on the year.</p>
      <p>The unexpectedly upbeat exports report followed data last week showing that factory orders and industrial production both declined in October. Germany only narrowly avoided entering a recession in the third quarter.</p>
