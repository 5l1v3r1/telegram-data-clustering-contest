      <p>And BT Sport pundit Sutton couldn't resist having a dig at the Parkhead club's Old Firm rivals last night.</p>
      <p>He simply tweeted: "And they are still coming..."</p>
      <p>A reference to a phrase commonly used by Rangers fans, it has become a punchline for their Celtic counterparts in recent years.</p>
      <p>And many Hoops supporters loved Sutton's latest dig at the Ibrox club.</p>

      <p>@Jim0666 tweeted: "Still can't see them."</p>
      <p>@BarbaraMcMahon8 replied: "God bless their deluded blue cotton socks."</p>
      <p>@IncubatorMan added: "They've been and gone. Next!"</p>
      <p>While @PolskaBhoy, in reference to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> star Scott Arfield's goal celebration, asked: "Are you sure?</p>
      <p>"Even Arfield can't see them and he 'plays' for them."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5044184/celtic-ryan-christie-twerk-scott-brown-cup/">Celtic star Ryan Christie hilariously pranked Scott Brown</a> during the team's dressing room celebrations.</p>
      <p>After the skipper was pushed to the floor by Jonny Hayes, Christie then sat his bum on Brown's head and twerked.</p>
      <p>The skipper saw the funny side however as he could be heard laughing with the midfielder afterwards.</p>
