      <p><b>MOSCOW – </b>As Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy meet for the first time Monday, many wonder what Moscow’s long-term goal is in strife-torn eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The talks, mediated by France and Germany, will focus on implementing the Minsk accords — agreements drawn up in 2015 to end the fighting and find a political solution for Ukraine’s separatist regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
      <p>In providing moral, economic and allegedly military support to the separatists, Moscow has been following a playbook it has used elsewhere in the ex-Soviet world.</p>
      <p>Its tactics in other frozen conflicts in the region — in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria — could provide a glimpse of the future for eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <h4>Supporting separatists</h4>
      <p>The 1991 collapse of the USSR sparked a series of separatist movements, as borders drawn up by the Soviets left behind a patchwork of ethnic and linguistic tensions.</p>

      <p>Russia fiercely opposed separatists on its own territory — the war in Chechnya is the prime example — but in other cases backed what it said were calls for self-determination.</p>
      <p>In Georgia, Moscow supported two breakaway regions: Abkhazia on the Black Sea and South Ossetia on the edge of the Caucasus mountains.</p>
      <p>Ethnically and linguistically distinct from Georgians, the Abkhaz and South Ossetians declared their independence in the early 1990s and fought against Georgian forces.</p>
      <p>When Mikheil Saakashvili became Georgia’s president in 2003 and vowed to bring his country into NATO and the European Union, Moscow’s support for the separatists intensified.</p>
      <p>And when Georgia launched a military attempt to retake South Ossetia in 2008, Russia sent in its troops, defeating Georgian forces in five days. A few weeks later it recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent.</p>
      <p>In Moldova, Moscow has backed Russian-speaking separatists living in an industrial area east of the Dniester river.</p>
      <p>They proclaimed an independent republic — Transnistria — shortly before the Soviet collapse and battled Moldovan forces in 1991-92. Units of the Russian army fought with the separatists until a cease-fire agreement was signed in 1992.</p>
      <p>The separatists in Ukraine emerged much later. After a pro-Russian president was ousted in public protests in 2014, Russia moved quickly to annex Crimea in Ukraine’s south and clashes broke out in Donetsk and Lugansk in the east — all largely Russian-speaking regions.</p>
      <p>Heavy fighting erupted after the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics declared their independence in May 2014. Large-scale battles have subsided, but deadly clashes persist on the front line.</p>
      <h4>Winning hearts and minds</h4>
      <p>Moscow has a varied arsenal for exerting its influence in separatist regions.</p>
      <p>Economic support is crucial.</p>
      <p>In Abkhazia, more than a million Russian tourists descend on the coast every year to relive the days when it was known as the “Soviet Riviera.”</p>
      <p>South Ossetia’s economy has been closely integrated with the economy of North Ossetia across the mountains in Russia.</p>
      <p>And in Transnistria, steel and electricity plants are fueled by supplies of cheap Russian gas.</p>
      <p>Abkhaz, South Ossetians and Transnistrians can also obtain Russian passports, and Moscow provides them with social assistance and even pensions.</p>
      <p>Eastern Ukraine has followed much the same pattern. Russia has sent nearly 100 convoys of humanitarian aid across the border, including medicine and food.</p>
      <p>And it fast-tracked Russian passports for eastern Ukrainians earlier this year, with the governor of a neighboring Russian region saying last month that more than 170,000 had been issued.</p>
      <h4>Freezing the conflict</h4>
      <p>The conflicts in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria have settled into uneasy stalemates.</p>
      <p>Initially deployed as peacekeepers or monitors, Russian forces have established a permanent presence in the regions. In 2016 Abkhazia and Russia agreed to a joint military force.</p>
      <p>The territorial disputes have meanwhile held Georgia and Moldova back, especially in efforts at closer integration with the West, as interminable negotiation processes make little headway.</p>
      <p>However some differences make eastern Ukraine distinct — its vast size and population and proximity to the European Union, the West’s stronger support for Kiev and sanctions against Moscow, and the potential drain on Russia’s resources.</p>
      <p>Those differences will complicate negotiations too.</p>
      <p>The Geneva International Discussions (GID) on Georgia — which is much smaller and less strategically important than Ukraine — have plodded on, largely forgotten, since the 2008 war. A 50th round of talks is due later this month.</p>
