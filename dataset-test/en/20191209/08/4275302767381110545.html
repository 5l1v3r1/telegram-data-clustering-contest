      <p>Emergency services set up camp on Tay Street as searchers battled against torrential downpours and strong winds.</p>
      <p>Efforts were focused on an area around the Queen’s Bridge throughout the afternoon. A Police Scotland helicopter was spotted circling above the city centre and Kinnoul areas.</p>
      <p>There was also a large police presence around Mr McGannon’s home in Iona Court.</p>
      <p>Dog handlers carried out a search in woods near the property, while officers quizzed neighbours about his possible whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Mr McGannon was last seen at around 9pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He is described as 6ft 1in tall, slim with grey hair. Police said he walks very slowly.</p>

      <p>Inspector Mark Veal said: “We are becoming increasingly concerned for Michael’s welfare and are keen to trace him as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“Given his age and the adverse weather over the past 18 hours, we would like to know he is okay and would urge anyone with information to contact us.”</p>
      <p>He made an appeal directly to Mr McGannon: “If you are reading this, please let us know you are safe.”</p>
      <p>Neighbours said they were shocked by Mr McGannon’s sudden disappearance.<br/>They said he is a keen cyclist and previously worked in insurance and for a local parcel courier company.</p>
      <p>“I just hope he turns up safe and well,” said one resident.</p>
      <p>Rescuers were scrambled to the riverside area just before 12pm. They left the area by 4pm as darkness fell.</p>
      <p>It is not known if they were reacting to a reported sighting, but police confirmed the operation was in connection with the missing person inquiry.</p>
      <p>Anyone who may have seen Mr McGannon is urged to call police on 101 quoting incident number 1298 of Sunday, December 8.</p>
