      <p>Arjun Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer period drama Panipat released last Friday. The controversies that had surrounded the film pre-release just intensified post-release and we saw a certain section getting offended with the portrayal of Rajasthan’s Maharaja Surajmal. While we saw Vasundhara Raje condemning the portrayal, now it is Randeep Hooda who has come out and spoken about the same.</p>
      <p>Panipat though not creating the buzz it was expected to, has impressed the majority of the critics and a fair portion of the audience. What sparked the controversy post-release is that the makers chose to show the character assassination of the Rajput King Maharaja Surajmal. People on the internet bashed the makers for taking this cinematic liberty.</p>
      <p>Directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar, Panipat stars Arjun, Kriti and Sanjay Dutt in pivotal parts. The film is based on the iconic third battle of Panipat.</p>

      <p>Talking about portraying the Rajput king in a bad light, Highway actor Randeep kept a neutral take, where he did condemn the makers for demeaning one to glorify others. But he also requested the people to watch the film as entertainment and not connect it to the ancestor legacy.</p>

      <p>He wrote, “To glorify one community, one doesn’t need to show others down.. it mostly has an adverse effect .. hoping for a more mature understanding in the future. To the offended – it’s just a movie, don’t attach your ancestors’ legacy to a piece of pure entertainment #MaharajaSurajmal.”</p>
      <p>We also saw the Former CM Vasundhara Raje express that the wrong picturisation of Maharaja Suraj Mal’s character was condemnable.</p>
