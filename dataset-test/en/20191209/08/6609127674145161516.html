        <b>FRASER FORSTER grabbed the Betfred Cup for Celtic and beamed: I OWED it to Lenny.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On-loan keeper Forster saved Alfredo Morelos’ penalty in a Hampden masterclass as ten-man <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celts</a> won a tenth straight domestic trophy.</p>

      <p>Forster, who also denied Ryan Jack and Morelos from open play, dedicated the nerve-shredding cup win to his gaffer.</p>
      <p>He said: “The manager has been so good for me and my career.</p>
      <p>"He brought me here to Celtic the first time when I was a young keeper and he gave me my big opportunity.</p>
      <p>“He’s now given me another opportunity to come here and I will be forever grateful to him.</p>

      <p>“It’s fantastic to be at this club and to be part of big occasions like this.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always loved working with the gaffer. He’s such a good man-manager.</p>
      <p>“He knows what makes people tick and what makes people feel good. I will be eternally grateful to him.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had special times with him and I know what he thinks of me and the confidence he gives me.</p>
      <p>“I could never turn down the chance to work with him and it’s nice to repay a manager for the faith he has in you.</p>
      <p>“If you can’t be happy and celebrate in these moments you are in the wrong game. I’ve spoken about how tough it was for me last season.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to be back and competing for silverware with Celtic. I’m absolutely buzzing and I’m buzzing for the fans.”</p>
      <p>Forster produced a string of saves either side of Christopher Jullien’s controversial winner to break <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers’</a> hearts.</p>
      <p>He pushed out Morelos’ spot-kick after defender Jeremie Frimpong had been sent off for downing the Colombian in the box.</p>
      <p>Forster, 31, added: “You just go with your gut instinct. Luckily enough for me, I went the right way and I was able to make the save.</p>
      <p>“I just had a feeling and I decided which way to go. I didn’t overthink it.</p>
      <p>“There have been plenty of times when I’ve gone one way and the penalty taker has gone the other and it’s gone in.</p>
      <p>“As long as you win in a final that’s the main thing. We’ve been here before, played better and lost.”</p>
      <p>Delighted gaffer Lenny greeted his keeper with a ‘we’re not worthy’ gesture at the end.</p>
      <p>Asked about Lennon’s reaction, Forster said: “That’s the first time I’ve had a manager do that!</p>
      <p>“It’s fantastic it was in a cup final and we’ve gone on to win and get the clean sheet. It’s a nice one to add to the list.”</p>
