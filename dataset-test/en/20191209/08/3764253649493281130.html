      </p>
      <p>The device sports a 6.59-inch LCD display (2340x1080) that brings out the fine details and makes on-screen colours look more vibrant. Together with a micro-seam earpiece embedded into the top bezel and an ambient light sensor installed at the bottom, the front pop-up camera allows the display to have even thinner bezels while retaining the integrity of the display. Additionally, the HUAWEI Y9s has a high screen-to-body ratio with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9, maximizing the viewing area. When the screen is on, it offers a clear, clean and unobstructed view. When the screen is off, both top and bottom bezels "disappear”, looking like a boundary-free black mirror.</p>
