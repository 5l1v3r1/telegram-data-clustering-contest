      <h2>West Brom transfer news | Louie Barry left Albion in the summer for a dream move to Barcelona - but the Catalan giants still haven't forked out the compensation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Chapman, https://www.facebook.com/josephchapmanBM/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> have been left waiting by Barcelona for their Louie Barry money - and now Albion intend to raise the issue with FIFA because of the delay.</p>
      <p>Striker Barry, who represents England at youth level and who was picked up by the La Liga giants in the summer after being alerted to a series of eye-catching performances and goal returns at The Hawthorns, was supposed to cost Barca around £230,000 - a fixed sum that all clubs from overseas must pay by way of compensation if the player they’re recruiting is under the age of 23.</p>
      <p>That transfer, which involved Barca beating Ligue 1 side Paris Saint Germain to Barry’s signing, took place almost half a year ago yet Albion STILL haven’t heard anything back from the Catalan club, despite a number of appeals to communicate and pay up.</p>

      <p>Now the Baggies, who were considering their options in September, are in talks with the global governing body regarding the situation having had the all clear from the FA and the EFL that their paperwork regarding the offer they themselves made to Barry in the summer ticked all the required boxes.</p>
      <p>The £230,000 sum was expected to be received in two separate installments, but Albion have been left waiting, and of the opinion that Barca have been delaying the payment of the compensation from the off.</p>
      <p>They’re not alone in growing impatient, however.</p>
      <p>Indeed many of the mega-money deals conducted by Barca in recent years have left them owing a number of sides significant sums of money.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were owed the majority of the £142m fee agreed for the transfer of Philippe Coutinho, while Ajax too have been left waiting for much of the Frenkie de Jong transfer money.</p>
      <p>Albion were also being ignored by Barca’s La Liga rivals Getafe, who snapped up Allan Nyom for a comparative nominal fee in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Baggies were ready to report Getafe, too, but it’s understood that they’ve finally forked out the sum they owed.</p>
