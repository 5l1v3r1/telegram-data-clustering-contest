        <figcaption>According to the Consumer Protection Act, it is the dealership’s responsibility to repair or replace the car if it’s returned within six months of purchasing it. Picture: David Zalubowski/AP African News Agency (ANA)</figcaption>

      <p>It’s a story with which many car owners are familiar: you buy a second-hand vehicle, it breaks down, requires repairs - repeatedly - but it’s still not in fine working order and the dealership obstinately refuses to cancel the deal. </p>
      <p>So you take up the matter with the head office, trusting they will move swiftly to protect the brand’s good name. Only thing is, even if they make some attempt at damage control, dealerships can pretty much do as they please, flouting the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). And often, they get away with it.</p>
      <p>Heidene Lawrence says she’s tried everything for the past five months to cancel the deal on the 2011 “service-approved” Corsa that she bought from the Weltevreden Park Hyundai dealership on July 13 this year. Since then, it’s broken down five times - twice on the Johannesburg roadside, endangering her family’s lives. The dealership has attempted to fix the vehicle’s problems but refuses to cancel the deal.</p>
      <p>It seems dealerships can pretty much do as they please, flouting the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). And often, they get away with it.</p>
      <p>Lawrence has been presented with three options of other cars - all more expensive and outside her budget, which is a violation of the National Credit Act’s affordability guidelines.</p>
