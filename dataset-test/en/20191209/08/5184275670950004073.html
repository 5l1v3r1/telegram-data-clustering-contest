      <p>“I am doing the series The Family Man, so I think that’s my first step (towards the Hindi film industry). I enjoyed being a part of The Family Man a lot. I am very happy that season one got a lot of appreciation. I am enjoying working with the team of the show and I can’t wait for a new set of audience to see my work,” said Samantha, at the launch of designer Kresha Bajaj’s new collection Acropora. The event also marked the boutique’s first anniversary.</p>

      <p>The release date of the Amazon Prime video series ‘The Family Man 2’, which went on floors in November, is yet to be announced.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Samantha Ruth Prabhu was last seen in the fantasy drama ‘Oh! Baby’. She also had a cameo in ‘Manmadhudu 2’.</p>
