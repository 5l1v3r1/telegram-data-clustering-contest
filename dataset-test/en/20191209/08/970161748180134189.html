      <h1>Who was the winner of the I'm A Celebrity 2019 final?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T08:22:39+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 08:22</time> by <a rel="author">Caroline Westbrook</a></address>
      <p>Our TV screens are set to look a little emptier now that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here 2019 is over.</p>
      <p>Sunday night’s show saw the remaining three campers undertake their final trial of the series – and be rewarded with a slap-up dinner – before the results of the public vote were announced and the winner was crowned.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-whyment/">Andrew Whyment</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> having made the final after Kate Garraway was eliminated on Saturday night, there was everything to play for – but who took the King, or Queen, of the Jungle title?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Who won I’m A Celebrity 2019?</h3>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa was crowned Queen of the Jungle in the I’m A Celebrity 2019 final.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actress fought off competition <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/fans-tears-im-celebrity-stars-andy-whyment-jacqueline-jossa-cant-stop-crying-11412960/">from runner-up Andrew Whyment</a> to take the title – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/roman-kemp-booted-im-celebrity-third-place-jacqueline-jossa-andy-whyment-battle-jungle-crown-11412794/">with Roman Kemp having finished third earlier in the show.</a></p>

      <p>And she was visibly emotional as she thanked viewers for voting, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/dan-osborne-jacqueline-jossa-cosy-im-celebrity-jungle-win-11413591/">professed her love for husband Dan Osborne.</a></p>
      <p>‘Thank you so much for voting for me,’ she said. ‘I love my family so much, I love Daniel, I love  my kids, I love my mum and dad, my best friends…’</p>
      <p>Speaking before she was crowned winner she said she couldn’t quite believe how many of her fears she had faced in the Bushtucker Trials.</p>

      <p>‘I can’t believe I did all that stuff. It was not what I expected, it was a lot harder than I expected,’ Jacqueline admitted.</p>
      <p>‘But also I just didn’t think it was going to be such a turning point in life. I went in and was one person and I feel like I’ve come out as a different person.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like I’ve grown in confidence and found who I am as a person a little bit more.’</p>

      <p>Earlier in the show Jacqueline undertook a gruelling trial to win last night food, drink and treats for camp, which saw her being covered in cockroaches, mealworms, critters, scorpions and spiders – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/im-celebrity-get-winner-jacqueline-jossa-reveals-spider-weed-mouth-terrifying-bushtucker-trial-11413208/">one of which she had to hold in her mouth</a> to complete the trial.</p>
