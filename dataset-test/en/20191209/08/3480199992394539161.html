      <p>Veteran television presenter Peter Purves has said he is “shocked” and “hurt” after being dropped as a commentator from Channel 4’s coverage of the Crufts dog show.</p>
      <p>The former Blue Peter host and Doctor Who star said he was told the broadcaster is “refreshing” its line-up.</p>
      <p>The 80-year-old told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I got a phone call saying ‘There is no easy way to say this but actually you’re surplus to requirements, we don’t need you’.</p>

      <p>“I was stunned actually, there hadn’t been a hint about it, not a hint last year at the show. This would be my 42nd year at the show. I just feel it’s part of my life, so I was very shocked, I was very hurt.”</p>
      <p>Purves has served as a presenter and commentator for the dog show for 41 years.</p>
      <p>He said he has instead been invited to be a paid guest contributor, adding: “The point was I’m not part of the commentary team and the executive producer has invited me to be a guest contributor on two of the programmes on the Saturday and Sunday.</p>

      <p>“I’m going to be at the show because I’m gong to be presenting the award so it’s no skin off their nose so they can do something very nice for me.</p>
      <p>“I feel it was just a bit of a sop and it was perhaps to soften the blow and it didn’t.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s been part of our lives. It’s a four-day job but at my age there isn’t a lot of television work for people my age.</p>
      <p>“I did ask for the reasons to be in writing. I got them. There wasn’t a reason, it was just ‘We are always refreshing the show, sorry, one in, one out.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he thought “refreshing” was code for ageism, he said: “I believe the diktat from Channel 4 was we want a younger presentation team. I know that was said.”</p>
      <p>The production company that makes Crufts has been contacted for comment.</p>
