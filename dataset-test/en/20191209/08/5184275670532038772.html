      <p>Singer-composer-music director Harry Anand and singer Kaviczar have teamed up for a party song titled “<i>Naach Nachaniya</i>“.</p>
      <p>“‘<i>Naach Nachaniya</i>‘ is a very close song to me and Kaviczar. We have really worked hard and am sure audiences will love it just as they have loved my other songs. We wanted to end 2019 with a bang and the song was made keeping that in mind,” said Harry.</p>
