      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> owner and chairman <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/mel-morris">Mel Morris</a> has stressed the importance of having the club's best interests at heart in the search for new investment.</p>
      <p>Morris has made no secret of his desire to explore options to bring in finance.</p>
      <p>"We have probably spoken to 25 to 30 people over the course of the last two years," he said at last month's Derby Telegraph Sports Awards' evening.</p>
      <p>It is believed there has been interest from Europe, the United States, Canada and the Far East at various points along the way.</p>
      <p>Now the Rams are close to securing new investment.</p>
      <p>The club is in advanced talks with Henry Gabay, the co-founder and chairman of Duet Group, over an investment partnership, and a deal is expected to be completed this month.</p>
      <p>What will it mean for the club?</p>
      <p>The details of the potential deal remain under wraps, as you would expect at this stage, but it is investment and not a takeover.</p>
      <p>Whether it takes the form of Morris selling some of his existing shares or the club issuing shares to the new investor remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Given what Morris has been saying this year, he is expected to remain as chairman.</p>
      <p>In the summer, he said: "I always would like to be associated with this club and involved with this club. Therefore, that's something I would factor in very heavily in terms of someone looking to do something with us.</p>
      <p>"That's not to say I would stand in the way of someone if I could see they could do a better job and had more money. I'd be prepared to stand aside for that. The club's interests are more important than my own."</p>

      <p>Morris is keen to help guide Derby to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He has invested significantly to the tune of tens of millions of pounds since he bought the club outright in September 2015 for an undisclosed sum, believed to be around £50m.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I would like to see it through. The emotion and 'sweat equity' I have put into this club is incredible," he said in the summer.</p>
      <p>And when asked about new investment while receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award at last month's sports awards, Morris smiled: "What I can say is whether we have investors or not, I am going to be here, sadly for you guys, for a lot of years!"</p>
      <p>New investment could see a new face or two on the board.</p>
      <p>Derby announced in October that David Williams and John Kirkland had stepped down from the board of directors. Williams said the move represented a “natural step” in anticipation of potential investment coming into the club.</p>
      <p>The timing of new investment could be significant, and exciting, with the January transfer window set to open in a few weeks' time.</p>
      <p>Manager <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/phillip-cocu">Phillip Cocu</a> has said already that the club is looking to add "one or two" new signings alongside former England captain <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> who has joined the Rams as player-coach and is eligible to play from January.</p>
      <p>Derby are likely to have two January 'wish lists' in place, one with possible investment and one without although that does not mean they can go crazy in the market.</p>
