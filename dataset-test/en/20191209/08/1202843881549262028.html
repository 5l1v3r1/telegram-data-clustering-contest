      <p><b>Wellington</b> - At least one person was left in a critical condition when New Zealand's White Island volcano erupted suddenly on Monday, leaving authorities scrambling to treat the injured and find those unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the volcanic island -- also known as Whakaari -- off New Zealand's north coast had erupted while groups of tourists were visiting.</p>
      <p>"It is very much an evolving situation and of course all our thoughts are with those affected," she told reporters in Wellington, adding that an undetermined number of people were unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>Police said the eruption occurred about 2:11pm local time (0111 GMT) and there had been around 50 people nearby -- fewer than the 100 officials originally estimated.</p>
      <p>"Some of those people have been transported to shore, however a number believed to be on the island are currently unaccounted for," the force said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Of those transported to shore, at least one has been critically injured."</p>
      <p>St John Ambulance said there were up to 20 people believed injured but medical teams were still en route.</p>
      <p>"Emergency services are currently frantically trying to get these people back from the island to hospital for treatment," Whakatane mayor Judy Turner told AFP.</p>
      <p>There were particular fears for a group of visitors seen walking on the crater floor moments before the eruption occurred.</p>
      <p>Cameras providing a live feed from the volcano showed more than half a dozen people inside the rim before images went dark when the eruption occurred minutes later.</p>
      <p>- 'Five made it back' -</p>
      <p>The country's National Emergency Management Agency described the eruption as "moderate", although a thick plume of white ash could be seen for miles around.</p>
      <p>Several helicopters and aircraft were seen in the area and survivors were pulled off the island in tour boats.</p>
      <p>White Island is about 50 kilometres (30 miles) offshore in the picturesque Bay of Plenty and is popular with adventurous tourists willing to don hard hats and gas masks.</p>
      <p>At least one group, four tourists and one pilot, who flew to the island on a Volcanic Air helicopter were accounted for, despite landing shortly before the eruption.</p>
      <p>"It had landed on the island. What happened after that we don't know, but we know that all five made it back to Whakatane on one of the tourist boats," a company spokesman told AFP.</p>
      <p>White Island is New Zealand's most active volcano cone and about 70 percent of it is under water, according to government agency GeoNet.</p>
      <p>Around 10,000 people visit the volcano every year. It has erupted frequently over the last half-century, most recently in 2016.</p>
      <p>In August of that year the New Zealand Defence Force airlifted a 2.4-tonne shipping container onto the island to serve as an emergency shelter in case of an eruption.</p>
