      <p>Manchester City players put their miserable weekend behind them to celebrate the birthday of team-mate Raheem Sterling at his glitzy birthday bash.</p>
      <p>The England star marked his 25th birthday by throwing a Great Gatsby themed party in the Cloud 23 Bar in The Hilton Hotel in Manchester on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The party saw his team-mates all get into character as they put their 2-1 defeat to local rivals <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in Sunday's Manchester derby at the Etihad behind them.</p>
      <p>Sterling donned an all-white suit with a fur jacket and grey waistcoat along with a cane as he welcomed guests to the bash and posed on the red carpet with custom-themed Great Gatsby cladding.</p>

      <p>Leroy Sane went for a white shirt and braces look as he looks to hopefully return to action in the near future after his injury lay-off.</p>
      <p>City's Premier League title defence is in disarray after their defeat to United, which left them third in the table and 14 points behind high-flying <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>

      <p>Star man Sterling is currently locked in negotiations with City over a big-money new contract - and chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak praised the "exceptional" attacker in a rare interview with the press last week.</p>
      <p>“I’m very proud of what Raheem has done over the last couple of years," Al Mubarak told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“His evolution as a player, but more importantly as a person, I think has been exceptional.</p>

      <p>“He has become a leader, both on and off the pitch, he’s become a leader in this squad at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , he’s becoming a leader at England serving his country, and a leader in the community.</p>
      <p>“I’m so happy for him, I think he’s a wonderful young man and...one thing I’m sure of, Raheem is only going to improve and only going to grow as both a player and a leader, so the future is very bright for Raheem and it’s a pleasure to have him as part of the team.”</p>
      <p>Sterling signed a new deal 12 months ago to keep him with the club until 2023, but they are already keen to tie him down to a longer deal.</p>
