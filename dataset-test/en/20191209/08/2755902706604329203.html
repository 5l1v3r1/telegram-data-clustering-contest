      <p>Three weeks ago, the country was rocked by the news of a <b><a href="https://iharare.com/breakingzimba-man-murders-wife-in-pretoriawraps-body-in-plastic/">Zimbabwean man, Kuziva Tsvito, who brutally murdered his wife Netsai Makore, in Pretoria, South Africa</a></b>. In an effort to conceal his murderous crime, Tsvito wrapped the body in plastic and continued staying in the same room with it, together with his 3-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>Joseph Makore, the brother of the deceased Netsai, revealed more details on the grisly murders and revealed that Tsvito had carried out an elaborate ruse to protect himself. Speaking to <b><a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/grisly-sa-murder-details-emerge/">H-Metro</a></b>, Makore said,</p>
      <aside>He stabbed my sister six times – on the neck, chest and the hand which she possibly tried to shield herself from the attack.<br/>He stashed the body under the bed. I would come and ask the whereabouts of my sister since I did not hear from her as this was unusual of her but Tsvito would lie to my face pretending not to know where my sister was.<br/>He would act surprised yet he knew exactly what he had done and the worst part of it is he would take my deceased sister’s phone then text me as if it’s coming from my sister achinyora achiti musanditsvage, ndiri ku Capetown.<br/>It’s difficult to comprehend what he did to my sister if it was an accident we could understand why but this is unacceptable.</aside>

      <p>Makore also dismissed social media stories which claimed that <i><b><a href="https://nehandaradio.com/2019/12/04/zimbo-who-murdered-wife-commits-suicide-while-being-chased-by-police-in-sa/">Tsvito had committed suicide</a></b></i>. He speculated that Tsvito could be hiding out in Mozambique as it is close to his home. Tsvito is from Dangamvura, Mutare. He also denied claims that Tsvito was a bodyguard for Prophet Makandiwa or Prophet Magaya. Said Makore,</p>
      <aside>Whatever is being posted on social media are all lies. I’m the one who reported the matter to the police and I’m well informed of the circumstances. If there are any latest developments on the hunt for this murderer, I’ll be the first to be in the know.</aside>
      <p>Netsai’s body was buried over the weekend.</p>
