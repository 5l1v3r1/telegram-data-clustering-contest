      <p>Steve Bruce believes his side have given themselves no more than a "platform" to push on in the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>The head coach - whose arrival as boss was met coldly by the majority of punters - has now lost just once at St James' Park with his side in the best form in the Premier League since 2014.</p>
      <p>Bruce is just one point behind Alan Pardew's team in the 2014/15 season.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the sturdy start to life as boss, Bruce said: "I think we've only lost our first game here.</p>
      <p>"It's always important that your home form stacks up.</p>
      <p>"We've given ourselves a nice little platform, but that's all it is.</p>
      <p>"We've still got some big games, we're not halfway there yet.</p>
      <p>"But as I've said, December can be a defining month and we've had a decent start."</p>
      <p>Bruce couldn't help but laugh when a reporter asked him after the game: Would you have taken 22 points at this stage?</p>
      <p>To which he replied: "What do you think?!"</p>
      <p>Refreshingly, Bruce was not fully satisfied with the performance levels of the Magpies.</p>
      <p>He said: "We were nowhere near the levels which are needed.</p>
      <p>"They hung on with their spirit.</p>
      <p>"We looked jaded, we looked tired, we looked like a team that didn't really have any energy, and it wasn't until we made a couple of tactical changes and fresh faces that things changed."</p>
      <p>Bruce has spoken on numerous occasions about squad rotation in December.</p>
      <p>And after losing Allan Saint-Maximin and Ciaran Clark to muscle injuries, he said: "Well the first half, it was fair to say from both teams it was non-eventful, wasn't it?</p>
      <p>"I toyed with changing us. It's the first time we've had three games in nine days and the extra day recovery that Southampton had is huge.</p>
      <p>"Because I didn't, we've probably picked up two muscle injuries which bear fruit of people not recovered.</p>
      <p>"When people do it at half-time and full-time like they are, basically they are fatigued.</p>
      <p>"We got in at half-time and the substitutions, particularly Andy, the tweak in formation gave everybody a bit of life and again, the spirit is there for everybody to see.</p>
      <p>"That's three times we've been behind at home and to come back to win again was great to see."</p>
