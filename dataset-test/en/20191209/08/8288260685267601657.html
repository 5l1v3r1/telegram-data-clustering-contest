      <p>A couple thought they had snared a bargain when they bought a TV from a man at a Midlands motorway services car park - but the too-good-to-be-true offer turned out to be a scam.</p>
      <p>Nuneaton and Bedworth Neighbourhood Watch were alerted to the son a husband and wife, who said they were travelling from Chester to Bedford and stopped in Corley Services South car park.</p>
      <p>The pair said the man claimed to be a delivery driver and the TV was well-packed and looked to be the real deal.</p>
      <p>Now local Neighbourhood Watch volunteers have shared their story in a bid to raise awareness of the scam, CoventryLive reports.</p>
      <p>"Before leaving a man with a van stopped next to us offering brand new TVs from Costco claiming he worked there as a delivery man," the post reads.</p>
      <p>"He wasn't alone, there was a young guy with him around 20s and a small child. Being naive we bought one TV from him, TV was packed up and looked decent.</p>

      <p>"When we got home unpacking the TV we realised that it's just a blank TV screen, no connectors on the back."</p>
      <p>They have contacted police about the incident, which happened on December 7 at around 2pm.</p>
      <p>It has prompted Neighbourhood Watch members to warn: "If someone approaches you offering a seemingly great deal on things such as TVs, laptops, iPads and even mattresses whilst in a car park or similar setting, please call the police immediately."</p>
      <p>Anyone who wants to report any similar incidents or who has any further information should call Warwickshire Police on 101.</p>
