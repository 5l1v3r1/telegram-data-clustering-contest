      <p>MAGIC, live music, comedians, cabaret and children’s theatre are coming to Scarborough as part of the 2020 Fringe World Festival.</p>
      <p>City of Stirling’s Sunset Veranda will pop-up at Scarborough Beach from January 17 to February 16 offering a variety of acts in a stunning coastal setting.</p>
      <p>Music lovers will be enticed by shows including Tell Mama: The Music of Etta James, Movin’ Melvin Brown: Me and Otis (Soul of Otis Redding), The Paul Simon Experience, A Moment In Paradise: A Whitney Houston and John Farnham Tribute Show and The Music of Disney starring Adam Hall and the Velvet Playboys.</p>
      <p>Comedian Akmal Saleh will be trying out material for his forthcoming stand-up show and keep the laughs coming with comedians Steph Tisdell, twins The Stevenson Experience, hypnotist Matt Hale and magician Tony Roberts.</p>
      <p>There will also be performances by WA’s Lady Velvet Cabaret and Fliptease, along with a range of children’s shows such as Noongar Lullabies by Djinda Djinda Community Choir, An Unfairy Tale, baby disco dance hall, and DIY surf and skate art.</p>
      <p>The festival kicks off with a free opening event on January 17 and Sunset Veranda opens Thursday to Sunday evenings with live music and open-air bar.</p>
      <p>Stirling mayor Mark Irwin said there was a great mix of free and ticketed events so there was something to suit all tastes and budgets.</p>
      <p>“Entry to the venue is free so it is the ideal place to grab a drink and soak up the atmosphere of our open-air bar as the sun sets, and for the more adventurous I highly recommend buying a ticket to a show in the Big Top,” he said.</p>
