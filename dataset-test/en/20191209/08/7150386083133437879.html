      <p>India’s <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Shivam-Dube/">Shivam Dube</a> whose maiden T20I half-century in Thiruvananthapuram in the 2nd T20I against <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/West-Indies-Cricket-Team/">West Indies</a> went in vain – as India lost the match by eight wickets – reckons that if the catches were taken, the result of the game would have been different.</p>
      <p>“I think we could not get some catches and if that were taken, it would have changed everything. We lost the match today but I think we will come back in the next match,” said Dube during the post-match presser.</p>

      <p>India dropped three catches – two in one over – that too of the eventual Man of the Match Lendl Simmons and fellow opener Evin Lewis. Both of the capitalised on their reprieves and put West Indies on course for a win.</p>
      <p>In the 17th over as well <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Shreyas-Iyer/">Shreyas Iyer</a> grassed a tough chance off Nicolas Pooran and the wicketkeeper-batsman went on to remain unbeaten on 38 off just 18 balls. But, Dube sounded confident that the team will bounce back in the series decider.</p>

      <p>“Yes, we dropped some catches but I think it is part of the match and even they dropped some catches. But I think we are the best team,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dube was bumped up the order at No.3 and he made the most of the opportunity making a 30-ball 54, laying the foundation for India’s 170/7. However, West Indies overhauled India’s total with eight wickets in hand and nine balls to spare. Dube said it was a special moment for his to get to the fifty, but was not happy with the result of the match.</p>
      <p>“It is really special for me because it is first 50 from my side to the Indian team. But not happy because winning the match is more important for me,” he added</p>
