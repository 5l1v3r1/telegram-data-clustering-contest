      <p>Meanwhile, Alia will be next seen in Brahmastra, Sadak 2 &amp; RRR. Her upcoming film Brahmastra which was scheduled to release in Summer 2020 has been pushed to Winter. Talking about the same, a source told Bollywood Hungama, ‚ÄúA major chunk of VFX is still pending which includes the stuff shot with Shah Rukh Khan at a studio in Mumbai, and the plot that unfolds in Manali and Varanasi. The company working on the visual effects has conveyed to the producers that they won‚Äôt be able to get the film ready by Summer due to complexities in the visual effects, which has come across as a shock to everyone working on the film.‚Äù</p>
      <p>The source added, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to release a half-baked product and hence giving the adequate time to visual effects. The vision is to bring in the biggest film from Bollywood, with no compromises on any aspects. Ayan and Karan are fine with a little more delay as they are sure, that the audience will be blown away by the visuals once the trailer and teaser is unveiled.‚Äù</p>
