      </p>
      <p>The election was held on Saturday, December 7.</p>
      <p>The returning officers in all the local government councils announced the results at the headquarters of the Ekiti State Independent Electoral Commission (ESIEC).</p>
      <p>Similarly, the PDP also rejected the result of the election.</p>
      <p>Local government elections in Nigeria are usually won by the ruling parties in the states, a situation which has made many to question the independence of state electoral bodies.</p>
      <p>Not fewer than four local government elections have been conducted so far in 2019 and all were won by ruling parties in the state.</p>
      <p>Local government chairmanship and councillorship elections are conducted by state electoral bodies, not the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>
