      <p>The Nigerian Army says troops of 68/94 Battalions of Operation LAFIYA DOLE deployed in Malam Fatori, Abadam area of Borno State, have crushed Boko Haram insurgents in the area.</p>
      <p>Concise News understand that in a separate counter-insurgency operation conducted on 4 December 2019, at Darel Jamel, Bama, troops rescued 31 persons comprising 14 women and 17 children from the insurgents.</p>
      <p>According to a statement issued issued by Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, on Monday, 9 December, the troops in Malam Fatori carried out the operation following a report by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR).</p>
      <p>The statement read: “The troops successfully uncovered the enclave and proceeded to engage it with devastating volumes of fire. Without any attempt to return fire, the cowardly criminals scampered into the nearly bushes in complete disarray. Subsequently, the troops immediately embarked on an exploitation of this success by pursuing them along their withdrawal route. During the said exploitation, troops discovered the body of one Boko Haram terrorist and further observed several trails of blood along the said route.</p>
      <p>“Additionally, 2 AK 47 Rifles, 2 AK 47 Rifle magazines loaded with 30 rounds of 7.62mm Special ammunition each, 3 unexploded Mortar bombs for making of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) were captured from the insurgents. Other items equally captured include, one bundle of IED cable, one IED battery, one camel bag, 3 motorcycles, 3 sets of overall cloths, bedding materials, cooking utensils, food items, motorcycle spare parts, 122 cylinder tubes and various mechanical tools.</p>
      <p>“It could be recalled that, in a related development that occurred on 3 December 2019, the criminal Boko Haram elements suffered a similar defeat in the hands of the troops of 144 Battalion deployed at Limankara in Gwoza LGA of Borno State during a failed attempt to infiltrate the troops’ location. During the exploitation exercise that followed the brief fire fight with the marauding criminals, the troops discovered burnt body parts of 3 Boko Haram criminals hit by a Rocket Propelled Grenade bomb explosion as well as some broken AK 47 Rifle parts and traces of blood along the criminals’ withdrawal route.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, on 3 December 2019, troops of 101 Task Force Battalion deployed at Cross Kauwa in Kukawa LGA of Borno State made contact with some marauding Boko Haram criminals while conducting Clearance Operations along Cross Kauwa – Monguno Road. The visibly shaken Boko Haram criminals who evidently couldn’t stand the troops superiority fled for safety. Nevertheless, the unrelenting troops went on a hot pursuit and arrested 2 of the criminals. In another development that occured on 4 December 2019, troops of 68/94 Battalions deployed at Malam Fatori in Abadam LGA of Borno State conducted a successful ambush at a Boko Haram criminals crossing point North East of the town and neutralised one Boko Haram criminal while many others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds. However, the troops recovered some vandalised roofing sheets, 33 IED detonator cords and other IED making materials. Preliminary investigation revealed that the criminals are part of IED laying party along the route.</p>
      <p>“In another successful ambush operation conducted by the troops of 21 Special Armoured Brigade on 4 December 2019, at Darel Jamel, Bama LGA of Borno State, the troops neutralised one Boko Haram terrorist while several others escaped with gunshot wounds. Same troops also conducted a robust clearance operation same day and cleared Boko Haram criminals’ hideouts at Mantari, Malam Masari and Gabchari Villages in Bama LGA of Borno State. During the Operation, troops neutralised one Boko Haram criminal and destroyed all discovered terrorists’ enclaves within the area. It is gratifying to note that, the troops also rescued 31 persons comprising 14 women and 17 children from the insurgents.</p>
      <p>“In a related development, a Boko Haram member, Abba Modu, voluntarily surrendered to the troops of 3 Battalion (Main) deployed at Gamboru in Ngala LGA of Borno State on 3 December 2019. Preliminary investigation revealed that he joined the sect in 2015 and was a member of Mamman Nur group. He also disclosed that he actively participated in rustling cattle for the sect. He however declared that he regretted his past actions and called on his former colleagues to use this opportunity to surrender to authorities so that they do not perish as sinners.”</p>
