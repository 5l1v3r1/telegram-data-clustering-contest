      <h1>Liverpool boss sends transfer message to Aston Villa, Leeds United and Bristol City after links to striker</h1>
      <h2>A number of clubs are said to be interested</h2>

      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says the club will only let Rhian Brewster leave on loan to the right club.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> are one of a number of clubs to have been linked with the 19-year-old, with Leeds United, Swansea City and Aston Villa all also said to be interested alongside a host of other clubs.</p>
      <p>Yet, speaking to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-could-sign-striker-january-17376558">Liverpool Echo,</a> Klopp explained that, if he were to allow the youngster to go out on loan, it needs to be to a side who will give him game time after an ankle injury kept him out for over a year and hampered his development.</p>

      <p>"Maybe Rhian is the one, age-wise, experience-wise, if he had not been injured, he would already have been on a different level, but that is the situation and we constantly think of the situation for the boys," Klopp said.</p>
      <p>"He is very young, but still a bit advanced, but I don't know, we don't make decisions right now. If we do [loan him] then it 100 per cent needs to be the right club.</p>
      <p>"They have all made steps here without playing Championship football week in and week out. They have all made massive steps here and Rhian's was delayed because of that big injury he had.</p>
      <p>"Neco (Williams), Curtis (Jones) and Harvey (Elliott) have made massive steps here without playing week in and week out. No decision has been made yet [on the loan]."</p>
      <p>It could be a blow to the Robins, who are known to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/controversial-liverpool-transfer-policy-bristol-3578151">have had a hit-and-miss relationship with Liverpool due to Ryan Kent's failed loan to Ashton Gate two seasons ago.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">The Robins</a> are on the lookout for a striker in January and have been heavily linked with Eddie Nketiah, who is on loan at Leeds United from Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Nketiah has struggled for first-team football at Leeds and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-arsenal-eddie-nketiah-3620792">there have been differing reports over whether the Gunners will recall him and send him out on loan elsewhere.</a></p>
      <p>Leeds have been linked with Brewster if Nketiah leaves, whilst the Robins could be interested in the Liverpool starlet should they fail to land their main target.</p>
      <p>Yet, should Liverpool allow Brewster to leave, Klopp admits he will need to bring a new striker in.</p>
      <p>He said: "Yes, we have to see. We can't just give the boys [away] on loan because we have built this squad.</p>
      <p>"We have three long-term injuries and four with Paul Glatzel, two of them were pre-season. Two came later with Joel (Matip) and Fabinho.</p>
      <p>"That gives us a 16-player squad and I count the kids, but we cannot only give players on loan and think it is good for him, we always have to consider both situations.</p>
      <p>"The boys and ours, and in the end, we try to make the perfect solution. Sometimes it works out, others it does not."</p>

      <p>Swansea could well be favourites for Brewster, with manager Steve Cooper having worked with the striker during his stint as England under-17s boss.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/swansea-city-liverpool-brewster-bournemouth-17376845">Wales Online,</a> Cooper said he is keeping tabs on Brewster's career, but did not confirm whether he was interested in the striker.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’m not aware of anything, people coming or going. I know we're only a few weeks away from that being able to happen but there’s no update on players coming in or going out.</p>
      <p>"I know him really well. He’s a good lad and a good player. I follow a lot of players’ careers that I’ve worked with, both at club and international level, and he's one that's had a bit of bad luck with injuries, but it’s good to see him back and fit.</p>
      <p>"I definitely like him as a player and a person and I wish him well whatever happens, like I do with all of the boys I've worked with."</p>
