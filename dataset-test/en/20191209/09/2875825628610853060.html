      <p>Corrie actress Lucy-Jo Hudson, who plays Donna-Marie Quinn, has opened up about co parenting with her ex Alan Halsell, who plays Tyrone Dobbs on the soap.</p>
      <p>The pair met on the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> set in 2008, and married seven years later.</p>
      <p>They split in 2018, and currently co parent their six year old daughter Sienna Rae, while they are both in new relationships.</p>
      <p>Lucy-Jo, 36, is pregnant with her new partner Lewis Devine, 30, who she started dating two months after announcing her split with Alan.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Alan, 37, is dating Tisha Merry, 25, who also stars in Corrie and plays Steph Britton.</p>

      <p>Lucy-Jo told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/lucy-jo-hudson-says-co-21037616">OK!</a> : “Co-parenting has its challenges and it can be difficult with everyone’s schedules but you make it work for the child involved.”</p>
      <p>She added that she is not fazed by Alan's new girlfriend, adding that Lewis would never try to take over Alan's role as Sienna-Rae's father.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy Sienna has a good male and female role model on my side and with Alan and his girlfriend", she explained.</p>

      <p>“She has more people to love her, and as long as Sienna’s happy, that’s all that matters to me.”</p>
      <p>Lucy-Jo, who is due in February, met her current boyfriend Lewis on set for the Snow White panto they both starred in, and they have been together for 18 months.</p>
      <p>She called their pregnancy a "miracle" and a "welcome surprise", and they previously revealed that they are expecting a baby boy.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Alan recently chatted to Mirror Online about the pressure his fans are putting on his to propose to Tisha, 25.</p>
      <p>He told us: "The pressure is there from day one but we've not been together that long, so I think we'll just enjoy ourselves for now."</p>
      <p>But Tisha set tongues wagging when she posed up wearing a fertility bracelet for an <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> snap.</p>
