      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/guardians-of-the-galaxy"><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i></a> director <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/james-gunn">James Gunn</a> has debunked a popular fan theory linking Chris Pratt’s lead character with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/captain-america">Captain America</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, some fans have wondered whether the superhero played by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ChrisEvans">Chris Evans</a> is actually Star-Lord’s biological grandfather.</p>
      <p>The theory first came to light after viewers noticed that Laura Haddock, the actor who plays Star-Lord’s mother in the <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> films, was in <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> back in 2011.</p>
      <p>Haddock plays a character who looks at Steve Rogers during his tour around the US.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/e4iro5/i_think_that_captain_america_is_peter_quills/">Reddit</a> user theorised that the repeat casting was intended to hint at the connection. They suggested that Steve and the woman had a relationship back in the 1940s, which resulted in the birth of Peter “Star-Lord” Quill.</p>
      <p>Gunn, though, has apologetically poured water on the theory.</p>
      <p>“Sorry to bust this fun theory, but it doesn’t work as Meredith Quill’s father is a major character played by @GreggHenry88 in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 and appears briefly in Vol 2.”</p>
      <p>Haddock isn’t the first actor to play two roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <i>Humans</i> star Gemma Chan, most recently seen as Minn-Erva in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/captain-marvel"><i>Captain Marvel</i></a>, will appear in<i> Eternals</i> alongside <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/richard-madden">Richard Madden</a> and Kumail Nanjiani next year.</p>
      <p>Gunn will return to direct <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3</i>, the release date of which has not been announced.</p>
