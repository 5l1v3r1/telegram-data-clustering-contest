      <p>This past weekend, Izanagi Games revealed the existence of<i> Death Come True</i>, a mysterious new project written and directed by Kazutaka Kodaka, the wild mind behind the dark <i>Danganronpa</i> series.<br/><br/>Details at this juncture are quite sparse, but the studio has released a poster (which you can check out below). <a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/12/izanagi-games-announces-full-motion-video-game-death-come-true-directed-and-written-by-kazutaka-kodaka">According to a translation by Gematsu</a>, the text reads "Is this a movie? or a game?" followed by "A story that begins by your choices". This somewhat implies<i> Death Come True</i> might be in the style of similar FMV/live action games such as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-428-shibuya-scramble-525146.phtml"><i>428: Shibuya Scramble</i></a> or the recent <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-telling-lies-562737.phtml"><i>Telling Lies.</i></a><br/><br/>Izanagi has <a href="https://deathcometrue.com/">also opened a teaser website</a>, with a countdown clock pointing to 00:00 PT on December 10, when we can no doubt expect further details. I've always had a soft spot for FMV games, ever since the heady days of the laserdisc arcade and its ill-advised early '90s resurgence, so I'm looking forward to hearing more about Kodaka's latest venture into the surreal.<br/><br/><a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/12/izanagi-games-announces-full-motion-video-game-death-come-true-directed-and-written-by-kazutaka-kodaka">Izanagi Games announces FMV game Death Come True</a> [Gematsu]</p>
