      <p>Derby County's quest to bring new investment into the club could soon be coming to a conclusion.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams</a> are understood to be in advanced talks over an investment partnership, and a deal <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-advanced-talks-over-3610063">could be completed by the end of this month</a>.</p>
      <p>The investor in question is Swiss/Turkish businessman Henry Gabay. So what more do we know about him?</p>

      <p>Gabay left CSFB in 2000 in order to set up his own company.</p>
      <p>In May 2002, he co-founded Duet Group - a "global alternative management company", which specialises in hedge funds, real estate and private equity.</p>
      <p>He has developed the company into a global concern, with offices in London, New Delhi, New York, and Accra in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The company has been particularly active in emerging and frontier markets.</p>
      <p>Gabay is currently a board member of various Duet companies, including Dashen Brewery, Duet Consumer West Africa, and South Asian Real Estate Ltd.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Duet Private Equity acquired the asset and wealth management firm Merit Capital.</p>

      <p>The acquisition, led by Gabay, added roughly 2,000 clients to Duet's portfolio and expanded the group’s European wealth management platform.</p>
      <p>He has been chairman of Merit Capital’s board of directors since August 2018, when the acquisition was officially approved by the National Bank of Belgium.</p>
      <p>Based in Antwerp, Merit Capital is valued at $1.3billion, according to the <a href="https://www.investorsglobe.com/investors/europe/henry-gabay/">Investor's Globe website</a>.</p>
      <p>Gabay currently lives in London.</p>
      <p>On the Duet website, his "skills" are listed as hedge funds, private equity, alternative investments, emerging markets and real estate. And a section called What I'm Looking For, adds: "Interesting opportunities".</p>
      <h3>Derby County</h3>
      <p>New companies Rams Investment Limited and Rams Sports Management Limited have been established and posted on Companies House in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Both companies are controlled by Gabay, who is the co-founder and chief executive officer of the Duet Group, a global investment holding company containing private equity, wealth management and other investment companies.</p>
      <p>Swiss national Gabay himself is not listed as a director of Rams Investment Limited; but is the director of Rams Sports Management Limited.</p>
      <p>Amit Haria, who serves as Duet’s chief financial officer, is named as director of Rams Investment Limited.</p>
      <p>Both companies give their registered office as being in Hill Street, London, the same address as Duet’s offices.</p>
