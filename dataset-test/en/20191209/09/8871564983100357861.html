      <h1>A fight over A&amp;W seats? Two arrested over brawl outside Jewel Changi Airport outlet (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:42:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Two men have been arrested over a brawl that broke out just outside the A&amp;W fast food outlet at Jewel Changi Airport on Sunday. </p>
      <p>Police were alerted to the incident at around 11am, and subsequently nabbed the unidentified men on suspicion of affray, or fighting in a public place. </p>
      <p>Both men sustained minor injuries, police told reporters today. </p>
      <p>The fight appeared to involve around 15 people, some of who seemed to be family members, and was captured, at least in part,  in a <a href="https://twitter.com/lkhsxc/status/1203923194295418884">15-second clip</a> now circulating online.</p>
      <p>The video opens <i>in media res</i>, so to speak, with the group already in the thick of the brawl and several participants engaged in their own one-on-one bouts as passersby looked on. </p>

      <p>Among the belligerents was a man with a blue backpack, who can be seen kicking, and subsequently whacking, the head of a younger man, before being punched in the head himself by a third person in green camo shorts. </p>
      <p>At the same time, the younger man being hit was pulling the hair of a woman in striped top, who was also yanking on the sweater of another man. </p>
      <p>Other women at the scene could be heard yelling at the group to stop.</p>
      <p>The clip has been posted to several Twitter accounts and Facebook pages, and one tweet of the clip by Twitter user Lekha.C.Siva has been retweeted over a thousand times. The user claimed that a lack of seats at the burger joint could be the root cause of the commotion. </p>
      <p>“Drama at A&amp;W cause of seats, relax la guys, take ferry to [Batam], eat and come back,” she said. </p>
      <p>Jewel Changi Airport is home to the first A&amp;W outlet since the American franchise returned to Singapore last year. Following the chain’s initial departure from the Little Red Dot in 2003, fans were forced to catch the ferry to Indonesia’s Batam island to get their root-beer-and-waffles fix. </p>
