      <h3>ATLANTA (AFP) - Miss South Africa was crowned Miss Universe on Sunday in Atlanta after a lavish ceremony filled with glitter and heartfelt speeches about female empowerment.</h3>
      <p>Zozibini Tunzi, 26, finished first ahead of the Puerto Rican and Mexican finalists in a flashy televised event, hosted by American comic turned TV personality Steve Harvey.</p>
      <p>Television personalities Vanessa Lachey and Olivia Culpo served as backstage commentators, and a panel of seven women determined the winner.</p>
      <p>Tunzi earned cheers during her closing speech, a new segment of the competition, in which she talked about wanting to empower young women to feel confident.</p>
      <p>"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me, with my kind of skin and my kind of hair, was never considered to be beautiful," she said.</p>
      <p>"I think that it is time that that stops today," she said to thunderous applause.</p>
      <p>Tunzi beat more than 80 contestants from around the globe in the 68th instalment of Miss Universe, which was held in Atlanta's Tyler Perry Studios.</p>
      <p>One of the favorites ahead of the competition,Â  Miss Philippines Gazini Ganados, did not make it to the final 10.</p>
      <p>The Philippines' Catriona Gray, who presented Tunzi with the crown, took home the Miss Universe crown in 2018.</p>
      <p>Although she did not make the finals, Miss Myanmar Swe Zin Htet made waves last week when she came out as the competition's first openly gay contestant.</p>
      <p>"I have that platform that, if I say that I'm a lesbian, it will have a big impact on the LGBTQ community back in Burma," Htet told People magazine, using her country's historic name.</p>
      <p>Homosexuality is illegal in the southeast Asian country and is punishable by up to life in prison.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the competition also featured Miss Spain Angela Ponce, who blazed a trail as Miss Universe's first transgender contestant.</p>
      <p>But the pageant has had a controversial past. Multiple contestants have alleged that US President Donald Trump would regularly enter the competitors' changing room while he owned the organization from 1996-2015.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Miss Universe continues to host the swimsuit competition, which has drawn criticism for objectifying the contestants, although that part of the pageant was not televised.</p>
