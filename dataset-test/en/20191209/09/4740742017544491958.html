      <h1>Huge prediction made in Championship race with Leeds United set for promotion in boost for Nottingham Forest and Bristol City</h1>
      <h2>The experts have updated their opinions</h2>

      <p>Bristol City's win over Fulham at the weekend has given both them - and Leeds United - a boost, according to a huge new Championship prediction.</p>
      <p>Data website <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/championship/">Five Thirty Eight</a> has a model to predict the outcome of the Championship this season and Leeds United are predicted to come top.</p>
      <p>In-form West Brom will run them close for the title - Slaven Bilic's side are predicted to finish just three points behind them in second.</p>

      <p>Yet Leeds have a 54 per cent chance of winning the title, with West Brom being given a 32 per cent possibility.</p>
      <p>Leeds have been boosted by the Robins' win at Craven Cottage, though - they now have a massive 84 per cent chance of getting promoted, and are predicted to finish 15 points clear of Fulham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">The Robins'</a> victory also sees them strengthen their claim for the play-off places.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">City</a> are predicted to finish sixth, in the final play-off spot, two points ahead of Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Robins have been given a 39 per cent chance of making the top six, and a 14 per cent chance of being promoted.</p>
      <p>Also involved in the play-off places are Fulham, Brentford and Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>If the website's prediction rings true, City will face Fulham in the play-off semi-finals.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the table, Barnsley, Wigan Athletic and Luton Town are predicted to be relegated.</p>
