      <h1>Federal govt's refusal to provide clean needles in prison to be challenged today</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- An Ontario court is set to hear today a constitutional challenge to the federal ban on needles for drug-using prisoners.</p>
      <p>The case, launched in 2012 by former prisoner Steven Simons, argues the current rules violate inmates' rights and expose them to serious blood-borne diseases.</p>
      <p>Several HIV/AIDS advocacy organizations are also involved in the challenge, saying the federal government must meet its legal obligation to protect the health of people in prison.</p>
      <p>The government has argued in court filings that giving clean drug-injection needles to prisoners would make federal facilities more dangerous, since syringes could be used as weapons.</p>
      <p>The Correctional Service last year launched a program that offers inmates in some facilities access to sterile equipment.</p>
      <p>But court filings say the program is currently only available in a handful of Canada's 43 federal prisons.</p>
      <p>Applicants in the court challenge are also expected to argue that the program infringes on prisoners' rights due to its lack of confidentiality.</p>
      <p>A rally in support of harm reduction in prisons is also scheduled this morning outside the Toronto courthouse.</p>
