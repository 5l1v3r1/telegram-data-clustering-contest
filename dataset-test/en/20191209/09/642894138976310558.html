      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:04:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:04</time> by <a rel="author">Global Research Partners</a></address>
      <p>SPI, the African distributor for utility software products and services to the Open Systems segment of the IT industry and the sole sub-Saharan Africa distributor for Help/Systems, today announced the latter will acquire Clearswift, a UK-based content threat protection software company.</p>
      <p>Clearswift’s award-winning deep content inspection capability enables information to be scanned as it enters or leaves the organisation, allowing sensitive data to be securely transmitted via e-mail, or other Web-based methods. Clearswift technology gives teams the freedom to do their jobs in a secure and collaborative way.</p>
      <p>Clearswift’s success is driven by its ability to embed its adaptive data loss prevention technology within its solutions, enhancing security effectiveness, and lowering the risk of business interruption. This comprehensive approach empowers organisations to gain visibility and control of their critical information as it’s processed and shared through digital collaboration channels.</p>
      <p>Clearswift has experienced growth over the past few years by delivering valuable solutions and strong customer support as directed by its departing CEO, Heath Davies.</p>
      <p>“The Clearswift solutions, and the talented team that supports them, strengthen HelpSystems’ growing cyber security business,” commented Kate Bolseth, CEO, HelpSystems. “The addition of the Clearswift solutions to the HelpSystems portfolio will provide customers an expanded set of cyber security options that protect critical data and enable compliance with industry mandates such as PCI, GDPR and HIPAA and help them stay on top of the shifting cyber security environment.”</p>
      <p>The content threat protection market is being driven by increasing internal and external threats as well as increased regulations within Critical National Infrastructure verticals such as national defence, emergency services, finance, government, healthcare and utilities. More than 1 700 organisations in more than 70 countries rely on Clearswift to protect critical information.</p>
      <p>“Clearswift’s unique product strengths are critical cornerstones of the overall cyber security strategies for its customers and are often used together with other cyber security solutions,” added Ciaran Rafferty, Managing Director, Clearswift. “We are confident we have found the perfect home for Clearswift and believe HelpSystems will continue to drive the products and business forward.”</p>
