      <p>SINGAPORE, Dec 9 — The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) has revoked the bunker supplier licence of Inter-Pacific Petroleum Pte Ltd effective today.</p>
      <p>In a statement here, MPA said Inter-Pacific would cease to operate as a bunker supplier in the Port of Singapore.</p>
      <p>According to the authority, Inter-Pacific has filed for judicial management at the Singapore High Court and a judicial manager has been appointed.</p>
      <p>“With the appointment of the judicial manager, Inter-Pacific has failed to meet the terms and conditions of the bunker supplier licence, leading to the revocation of the licence,” said MPA.</p>
      <p>This follows MPA’s earlier revocation of Inter-Pacific’s bunker craft operator licence on October 15 due to bunkering malpractices, it said.</p>
      <p>The maritime agency reminded all bunker licensees to adhere strictly to the terms and conditions of their licences.</p>
      <p>“MPA takes a serious view of contraventions of the licence terms and conditions, and will suspend or revoke the relevant licence(s) where necessary,” it said. — Bernama</p>
