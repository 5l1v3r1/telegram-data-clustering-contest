      <h3>Best Echo Dot deals</h3>
      <p>The Echo Dot is Amazon's cheapest smart speaker (the Flex isn't really a speaker - it's more of a utility device). With Alexa built-in it is capable of all the same things as the pricier Echos, but you don't get a display and audio quality is naturally inferior, but still surprisingly good. With a retail price of £49.99, buying an Echo Dot is the best way to try Alexa in your home without investing too much, and it's also the cheapest way to get an Echo in every room of the house when you ultimately decide you love it.

      </figure>
      <h3>Best Echo Dot with Clock deals</h3>
      <p>An updated version of Echo Dot comes with a built-in display that can show the time, alarms and timers, as well as the outside temperature - handy additions that enable Echo Dot to work as a bedside alarm clock, though they come at a £10 premium over the standard model. The Echo Dot with Clock retails at £59.99. Read our full <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/amazon-echo-dot-with-clock-3776046/">review of the Echo Dot with Clock</a>.</p>

      <h3>Best Echo deals</h3>
      <p>The standard Echo has just been updated with the third-gen model, which retails at £89.99 just like its predecessor. (It is still possible to find the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/06-3680483-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9170247">Echo 2 at Argos</a>, but unless the price comes down we'd advise buying the newer model.) A step up from Echo Dot, the new Echo offers a refined design and improved audio quality. Plus, Alexa is a constant across all Echo devices: she doesn't change. Note that this Echo does not have a built-in smart home hub or temperature sensor, so look further up the range for that.

      </figure>
      <h3>Best Echo Plus deals</h3>
      <p>Echo Plus (currently in its second-generation) is the device you want if you love the Echo Dot and standard Echo but want to step up audio quality a notch, with a larger 3in woofer and 0.8in tweeter over the standard model's 2.5in woofer and 0.6in tweeter. It also has built-in Zigbee that allows it to act as a hub for all your smart home kit. Naturally it costs a little more, with a retail price of £139.99.

      <p> </p>
      <h3>Best Echo Studio Deals</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazon-echo-studio-high-fidelity-smart-speaker-with-3d-audio-and-alexa/dp/B07NQCKJSH/?ascsubtag=06-3680483-11-0000000">Echo Studio</a> is the top-of-the-line Echo without a display. With a full retail price of £189.99, it's cheaper only than the 10in Echo Show. If you want the ultimate in sound quality, this is the Echo for you, with support for hi-res audio and 3D sound making this a significantly cheaper rival to Apple's HomePod and the Google Home Max. A large slot on the front allows bass from the 5.25in woofer to pour out, and the Studio also has two 2in speakers and a 1in tweeter inside, each positioned to deliver truly room-filling audio. Plus there's a built-in Zigbee hub for controlling compatible smart home kit. Read our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-3777328/">Echo Studio review</a>.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <h3>Best Echo Spot Deals</h3>
      <p>Sort of a cross between Echo Dot and Echo Show, Echo Spot is a smart alarm clock with Alexa built-in and the smallest (but not cheapest) of Amazon's Echo devices with a screen built-in. It retails at £119.99, which is £40 more than the Echo Show 5 (below), another compact Echo smart display.

      </figure>
      <h3>Best Echo Show 5 Deals</h3>
      <p>The most recent addition to Amazon's Echo line is the Echo Show 5, a smart display that is beaten on price only by the Echo Dot with a retail price of £79.99. Amazon builds in a 5.5in display, which is ideal if you want a screen but also a more compact device than the standard 10in Show. Read our full <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/amazon-echo-show-5-3698961/">Echo Show 5 review</a>. Amazon is also offering some great bundles with the Echo Show 5, such as with the Neos SmartCam for a combined <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07RMLK44R?ascsubtag=06-3680483-11-0000000">£64.99</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Best Echo Show Deals</h3>
      <p>The second-generation Echo Show is an Alexa smart display with a 10in screen. Retailing at £219.99 it's quite a bit more expensive than anything else in the line, but it also has a usefully large HD screen and packs decent audio with excellent volume and plenty of bass.

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Best Echo Input Deals</h3>
      <p>The Echo Input is not strictly an Echo speaker, though it offers a cheap way to turn an existing speaker into an Alexa device, so useful if you don't want to replace your existing kit but you wish it was a bit smarter. It retails at £34.99. Read our full <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/amazon-echo-input-review-3691210/">Echo Input review</a>.</p>
