      <h1>North Korea calls Trump 'thoughtless' old man over tweets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:58:38+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">KIM TONG-HYUNG, Associated Press</a></address>
      <p><b>SEOUL, South KoreaÂ (AP)</b> - North Korea insulted U.S. President Donald Trump again on Monday, calling him a "thoughtless and sneaky old man" after he tweeted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wouldn't want to abandon a special relationship between the two leaders and affect the American presidential election by resuming hostile acts.</p>
      <p>A senior North Korean official, former nuclear negotiator Kim Yong Chol, said in a statement that his country wouldn't cave in to U.S. pressure because it has nothing to lose and accused the Trump administration of attempting to buy time ahead of an end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un for Washington to salvage nuclear talks.</p>
      <p>Nuclear negotiations faltered after a February summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un in Vietnam broke down when the U.S. side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.</p>
      <p>Kim has said North Korea will seek a "new way" if the U.S. maintains its sanctions and pressure, and issued the deadline for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal.</p>
