      <p>Journalist Annika Hernroth-Rothstein has accused the Swedish police of enlarging her nose on her ID card to match an anti-Semitic trope because of her “very Jewish name”, a claim that has triggered mixed reactions.</p>
      <p>“Went to get a new National ID card &amp; passport at a police station in Sweden, handing in employment papers from an Israeli newspaper as well as proof of ID with 2 very Jewish names (while wearing a Magen David btw). Got back my ID and my nose has been doctored as seen below”, Hernroth-Rothstein tweeted, posting a picture of her nose apparently having an extra large tip hanging down to the lower lip.</p>

      <p>​For the sake of comparison, she posted a photograph of her driver's license, in which the grotesque nose is markedly absent.</p>

      <p>Annika Hernroth-Rothstein, who writes for Israeli and US newspapers, wrote she “felt scared &amp; kinda dirty” when seeing it, but accepted the ID, went home and “put it in a box never to be used”.</p>
      <p>​The 38-year-old, who has made a name for herself by highlighting Sweden's <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911121077285860-synagogues-publishing-houses-targeted-in-kristallnacht-anniversary-across-scandinavia/">anti-Semitism</a>, rose to fame in 2017 when she filed for asylum in her own country based on religious persecution, received a lot of support, not least from fellow Jews.</p>
      <p>“This must be investigated. A service error, to say the least ... both anti-Semitic and manipulation of ID documents”, lawyer Sebastian Scheiman wrote.</p>

      <p>​Dror Eydar, Israel's ambassador to Italy, proposed that Annika Hernroth-Rothstein apply for Israeli citizenship instead to show “real beauty” on official documents.</p>

      <p>​Many agreed that this was abominable and constituted reason enough for legal action. However, a number of people pointed out similar glitches on their own ID cards, which can no longer be pinned on <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910141077042854-swedens-jews-want-permanent-police-presence-after-synagogue-shooting-in-germany/">anti-Semitism</a>. In the words of Markus Henkins, a fellow journalist, “This has nothing to do with ethnicity and everything to do with a s***ty printing system”.</p>

      <p>​“Mine looks exaclty the same and I am no near Jewish”, Christian Democerat Adrian Repetto tweeted, posting a photograph of his ID.</p>

      <p>​“This is untrue, it is the overlip and the tip of the nose that are blurred together. As can be seen here on mine”, a Swedish woman tweeted, urging Hernroth-Rothstein to retract her “serious accusation”.</p>

      <p>​Another man explained that it had to do with contrast settings, posting a photograph of what he dubbed a “Hitler moustache”.</p>
