      <p>Anthony Joshua proves he is more than boxing after the heavyweight champion was seen showing rapping skill in an heartwarming scene that defines him as multi-talented ambitious young man.</p>
      <p>The British-Nigerian born recorded a resounding victory on Saturday night, December 7, as he majestically <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1282477-andy-ruiz-joshua-british-boxer-beats-opponent-reclaim-heavyweight-belts.html">reclaimed his heavyweight belts in a brutal action-packed 12th round defeat</a> of Andy Ruiz in Diriyah Arena, Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Earlier written off by critics after suffering first career defeat to Ruiz in June, the Nigerian-born boxing star put in breath and blood from intense six-month hard training to enthrone himself as king of heavyweight division again.</p>
