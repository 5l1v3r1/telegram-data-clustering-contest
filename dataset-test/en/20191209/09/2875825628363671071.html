      <h1>Anthony Joshua aims dig at Andy Ruiz Jr after partying admission</h1>
      <h2>Andy Ruiz Jr claimed he was overweight and spent too much time partying after being beaten by Anthony Joshua in their world heavyweight title rematch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:03:14+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Joshua says Andy Ruiz Jr's training ahead of their rematch was "not the way of a champion" after reclaiming his world titles.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr blamed his partying for defeat to Joshua in Saudi Arabia, admitting he was overweight and not adequately prepared.</p>
      <p>In stark contrast, Joshua came in significantly lighter than their first fight and demonstrated how hard he had worked in training camp to implement an entirely new game plan which paid dividends with a convincing win.</p>
      <p>Joshua says Ruiz Jr has only himself to blame for failing to train like a champion for his first title defence - but he has nonetheless declared he "hopes he gets it right" after being brought back down to earth.</p>

      <p>"I would love to have trained the way Andy trained," Joshua joked as he appeared on ITV's Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>"I would love to have trained that way.</p>
      <p>"In reality, that's not the way of a champion.</p>
      <p>"Andy can say all these things, but he knew he had a fight and he knew the best way to prepare.</p>

      <p>"Unfortunately for him it didn't go his way and I'm sure he'll make those changes.</p>
      <p>"Learning. Life's lessons come in different forms and Andy's was in the form of a loss as well.</p>
      <p>"He knows his mistakes, whatever they were, whatever those excuses, he just needs to go out there and get it right. I hope he gets it right."</p>

      <p>Speaking at the post-fight press conference, Ruiz Jr apologised to his father and coaches for failing to listen to their advice and adequately prepare.</p>
      <p>"For this fight, I was overweight... I should have trained harder. I should have listened to my coaches more. Maybe I shouldn't have put on all this weight that I did.</p>
      <p>"I trained myself for this fight... I'm sorry to my coach and to my dad.</p>

      <p>"I'd like to say the three months of partying didn't affect me, but it did. ... I think the partying and all this stuff got the best of me.</p>
      <p>"He was the better man, I should have taken it seriously and it would have been a different fight.</p>
      <p>"We're going to work harder in the gym and get better... I'm going to dedicate myself more.</p>
      <p>"I'd love to do it again but in better shape.</p>
      <p>"I felt I was going to do my best, you can't doubt yourself. Once I'm in the ring I have to motivate myself and pray that everything is OK.</p>
      <p>"I won one, he won one and I want to do it again."</p>
