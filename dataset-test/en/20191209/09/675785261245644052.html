      <h1>Unai Emery 'targeted three key Arsenal transfers' before downfall</h1>
      <h2>The sacked Arsenal manager oversaw a decent transfer window during the summer but was unsuccessful in his pursuit of his three top targets, including Man Utd's Harry Maguire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:04:55+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:04</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> failed to land three key players he had targeted to boost his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> squad prior to his side's downfall.</p>
      <p>The Spanish coach was sacked as the Gunners' boss at the end of last month after overseeing the club's worst run of results in over two decades.</p>
      <p>Emery had spent over £130 million during the summer in a successful transfer window for Arsenal, but <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1440713/2019/12/09/ornstein-on-monday-city-planning-for-life-after-pep-koscielny-and-ozils-goodbyes-to-emery-and-contract-talks-for-leicesters-maddison-and-soyuncu/">the Athletic report</a> he did not sign any of his prime targets.</p>
      <p>He had pinpointed England centre-back <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire">Harry Maguire</a> as a solution to the club's defensive problems, and was also keen on Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha and Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were forced out of the race for Maguire by Premier League champions Man City, and his eventual destination Man Utd - whom the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> defender had supported as a boy.</p>

      <p>Following a poor end to the previous season - which saw Arsenal miss out on a top four spot - Emery knew it was unlikely they would be able to trump the Manchester rivals who entered a bidding war for Maguire's signature.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Partey had been identified by Emery as an ideal candidate to strengthen Arsenal's midfield, but was put off by his 50 million euros release clause.</p>
      <p>Arsenal could not commit to that sort of figure, having made signing a wide player their priority, with Palace winger Zaha initially topping their shortlist.</p>
      <p>However after seeing a £40 million bid for Zaha rejected, Arsenal turned their attentions to Nicolas Pepe, who was seen as a wiser investment due to his age.</p>

      <p>Pepe eventually cost Arsenal £70 million, but has struggled to find his form since arriving from Lille, while the proven Zaha continues to perform at a high level for Palace.</p>
      <p>David Luiz was then brought in on deadline day as an alternative to Maguire for a cut-price £8 million fee, but the Brazilian has done little to shore up Arsenal's defence.</p>
      <p>Emery was not helped by the late appointment of Edu as the club's technical director, who was only able to make a limited impact on their transfer plans.</p>

      <p>In hindsight the failure to sign a top centre-back and Pepe's poor form ultimately contributed to Emery's sacking.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile interim boss Freddie Ljungberg has insisted he can turn Arsenal's fortunes around.</p>
      <p>The Swedish coach drew his first match in charge away at Norwich last week, and faces a tough trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg said: “100% I think I can do that otherwise I wouldn’t be here but of course it is difficult.</p>
      <p>“When confidence is low, it is low. That is just how it is. But we are going to work on trying to get that back. We need to change this downward spiral.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we should stop talking about the top four. But for us it is to concentrate on what we are doing here now and not look up, down, here, sideways. We just need to work on our own game and our own confidence.”</p>
