      <h1>Everton reportedly scouting Jarrad Branthwaite, could he be the next John Stones?</h1>
      <h2>Everton profited massively from bringing in John Stones from the Football League.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:15:49+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Everton are reportedly interested in the talented Carlisle defender Jarrad Branthwaite, <a href="https://twitter.com/bbccumbriasport/status/1203321516223586304">according to BBC Cumbria. </a></p>
      <p>They suggested that scouts from Everton were joining those from Celtic, Rangers and Arsenal in keeping tracks on the talented teenager at the weekend. </p>
      <p>The Grecians drew 1-1 against Morecambe but Branthwaite’s performances this season are certainly a reason for clubs like Everton to be keeping tabs. </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has been in fine form this season. He has been a regular in recent weeks for the League Two side and even became the club’s youngster ever scorer and captain in a 3-1 loss to Morecambe in the EFL Trophy back in November. </p>

      <p>His goal on that night truly highlighted his ability as a ball-playing centre-back, perhaps showcasing the reason why Everton and co are so keen. </p>
      <p>For Everton, they have targeted a similar player from the lower leagues in the past with great success. That player was John Stones. </p>
      <p>Everton ended up snapping up the teenager from Barnsley and he proved a hit at Goodison Park. The future England international eventually did enough on Merseyside to earn a huge transfer to Manchester City, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36913544">reported (BBC) to be worth</a> around £47.5 million. </p>
      <p>Stones cost Everton a<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21286890"> reported (BBC) £3 million </a>three seasons before his huge move to City. If Branthwaite could have a similar impact then this will undoubtedly be a worthwhile pursuit. </p>
