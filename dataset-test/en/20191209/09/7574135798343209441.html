      <p><b>The Haden Triplets</b> (Petra, Rachel and Tanya) are releasing a new album called<a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/17-new-songs-out-today-17/"> <i>The Family Songbook</i></a> on January 24 via Trimeter Records, and as you might have guessed from the title, it features songs from all across the very musical Haden family songbook (and as you may not have guessed, it also includes a <b>Kanye West</b> cover). Here’s some background:</p>
      <blockquote><i>The Family Songbook</i> mines their family’s heritage with newly discovered songs by their grandfather, Carl E. Haden, friend to the Carter Family and Porter Wagoner, and patriarch of the singing Haden Family, a fascinating footnote in country-music history.<br/><br/>Their uncle Carl Haden Jr. had recovered his father’s sheet music and relics like the songbook <i>Favorites of the Haden Family</i>. Carl released songs and songbooks, as well as ’zine-like collections of family photos and anecdotes, through the radio stations that broadcast the Haden Family, namely KWTO, out of Springfield, Missouri. Charlie Haden joined the family band as a tot in the late ’30s, and became a featured singer—yodelin’ “Cowboy” Charlie—when he was so young his mother had to hold him up to reach the mic.<br/><br/><i>The Family Songbook</i> also features arrangements of Carter Family, Josh Haden, and their take on Kanye West’s “Say You Will.” Produced by Woody Jackson, The Family Songbook might also be considered one of the year’s great guitar records, with <b>Bill Frisell, Greg Leisz</b> on pedal-steel and <b>Doyle Bramhall III</b>, joined by <b>Don Was</b> and the late bassist <b>Larry Taylor</b>, of <b>Canned Heat</b>.</blockquote>
      <p>The new single is “Every Time I Try,” which was written by their brother Josh Haden (of ’90s slowcore band Spain) for the 1997 Wim Wenders film <i>The End of Violence</i>, and also appeared on Spain’s 1999 album <i>She Haunts My Dreams</i>. The Haden Triplets take the <a href="https://youtu.be/kfbGzb2B_vI">folky, slowcore-ish original</a> and turn it into a sweeping, classic-sounding country-pop ballad, and the video follows suit, paying homage to the 1950s country western variety show <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&amp;v=jyESK7P77hs&amp;feature=emb_logo">Ozark Jubilee</a></i>, where their father Charlie Haden and their grandparents often performed. The video also stars <b>Nick Offerman</b> as the show’s host. Watch/listen below.</p>
      <p>The triplets are also touring in 2020, including stops at the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/big-ears-adds-patti-smith-winged-victory-fennesz-nivhek-more-to-2020-lineup/"><b>Big Ears</b></a> and <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/stagecoach-2020-lineup-announced/"><b>Stagecoach</b></a> festivals, as well as a NYC show on <b>April 11 at City Winery Loft</b>. <a href="https://citywinery.com/newyork/catalogsearch/result/?q=haden+triplets"><b>Tickets</b></a> for that show should be on sale soon.
