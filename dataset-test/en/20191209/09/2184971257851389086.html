      <p>The Met Office issued yellow weather alerts for up until 9am on Monday for areas stretching from north-west Wales to the Isle of Wight, while a second yellow warning remains in place for England’s east coast from Norwich to Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>The Met Office says delays are likely to road, rail, air and ferry transport, and that short-term loss of power is possible in some areas.</p>
      <p>Western Power Distribution said it had experienced 26 high voltage faults in the south-west on Sunday and two in Wales, leading to 5,500 customers being cut off from power over the course of the day.</p>
      <p>At Culdrose in Cornwall, the wind hit 70mph in the hour leading up to 9pm.</p>
      <p>“The strong winds are pretty widespread,” said Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill. “It’s very windy in the west and south-west so that’s where we’re going to see the greatest impact unfortunately.”</p>
      <p>In the south-west, Coastsafe, a partnership campaign aiming to improve coastline safety, urged people to be wary of tidal surges and debris being thrown over sea walls during the storm.</p>
      <p>The M48 Severn Bridge introduced lane closures on Sunday due to increasing wind speeds.</p>
