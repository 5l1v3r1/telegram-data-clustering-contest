      <h2>A new report by LetsGoDigital suggests that Sony is already working on the PlayStation 5 Pro, and that it could launch three years after the PlayStation 5</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:38:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> is one of the most highly-anticapted gaming consoles in history, and now it seems that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sony">Sony</a> is already looking ahead to a follow-up console.</p>
      <p>A new report by <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/sony-playstation-5-pro/">LetsGoDigital</a> suggests that Sony is already working on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
      <p>The report points to a recent interview with GameInformer, in which Sony executive Masayasu Ito indicated that the PS5 Pro is in development.</p>
      <p>He said: “In the past, the cycle for a new platform was 7 to 10 years, but in view of the very rapid development and evolution of technology, it's really a six to seven year platform cycle. Then we cannot fully catch up with the rapid development of the technology, therefore our thinking is that as far as a platform is concerned for the PS5, it is a cycle or maybe six to seven years.</p>

      <p>“But doing that, a platform lifecycle, we should be able to change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancements in technology.</p>
      <p>"That was the thinking behind it and the test case of that thinking was the PS4 Pro that was launched in the midway of the PS4 launch cycle.”</p>
      <p>Based on Mr Ito’s statement, LetsGoDigital claims that the PS5 Pro is likely to launch in 2023.</p>
      <p>It said: “From this statement it can be concluded that the PS4 Pro was a test case. This advanced console with improved hardware components was introduced three years after the PS4.</p>
      <p>“We now know that the release of the PlayStation 4 Pro has become a huge success for Sony. And so the company has reason enough to repeat this marketing strategy.</p>
      <p>“Since the PS5 will have a life cycle of around 6 to 7 years, it is likely that the PS5 Pro will be announced in 2023.”</p>
      <p>As with all rumours, Sony is remaining tight-lipped, so we’ll just have to wait and see if they’re true!</p>
