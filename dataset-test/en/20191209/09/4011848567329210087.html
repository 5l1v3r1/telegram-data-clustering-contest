      <p>Looking forward to a more productive 2020? Then, you should be more aggressive in grasping new technologies. Start with a new laptop. There are lots of laptops you'll find, be it online or at the physical stores. They vary in brand, features, specifications, and price. If you have a hard time which brand to buy, consider the Chromebook laptops. You might be wondering what difference do Chromebooks have from the other laptops. </p>
      <p>As in any other personal computer, you can think of the Chromebook as, more often than not, Internet-reliant, starting up ultra-fast and performs snappily. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-top-5-chromebooks-in-the-us-1233696">Chromebook laptops</a> are quite different as their applications focus on their services and applications of Google, including YouTube, Chrome, and Maps. Moreover, Chromebook laptops don't run on the Windows operating system. Instead, they are powered by Chrome OS.</p>

        <b>If you think buying a new Chromebook laptop will cost you a lot, think again because the HP Chromebook 14 is among the reasonably priced devices without its efficiency and usability being compromised. This may be a bit similar to one of the Acer Chromebooks in many ways, but this 14-inch Chromebook is quite more compact. And, even if this device's battery life and performance are just normal, it is considered one of the best Chromebooks today.</b>

      <p>Prior to Google's launch of the Pixelbook, and presented exactly how the best Chromebook should be, this Chromebook laptop was already the personal computer, many Google laptops aimed to be. Featuring a full-HD display and Intel Core processor, the Asus Chromebook Flip was, as reviewed on Amazon, "undoubtedly a game-changer." Like the HP Chromebook 14, if you are currently on a budget constraint, this one's a perfect choice to consider.</p>
