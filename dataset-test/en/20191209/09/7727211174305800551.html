      <h2>A murder investigation was launched after the Birkenhead-born dad-of-three was found dead in his flat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:32:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/charlotte-hadfield/" target="_blank">Charlotte Hadfield</a></address>
      <p>A grieving mum has been left desperate for answers after her son was found dead in his flat just hours after calling her for the final time.</p>
      <p>Michael Peers, originally from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead</a> and a massive Everton fan, was found lying unresponsive on the floor of his flat in Bolton on July 22 2018, where he suffered from a 'major trauma' to his abdomen.</p>
      <p>Just hours before his death, the dad of three and ex-soldier had phoned his mum Tracey Todd, to tell her he had been 'grabbed by the neck and punched'.</p>
      <p>And in a later phone call, to his ex-partner, Suzanne Penny, Mr Peers said he had been 'punched' before 'four smackheads upstairs jumped me'.</p>
      <p>Following Mr Peers' death, a murder investigation was launched, which led to eight arrests being made.</p>
      <p>Files were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, relating to two people under suspicion, but no one has ever faced criminal charges, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/two-litres-lost-blood-injuries-17377901">the MEN reports.</a></p>

      <p>An inquest into the 37-year-old's death last week, failed to determine how Michael Peers died.</p>
      <p>But a forensic pathologist said the cause of the injury was 'almost certainly kicking or stamping'.</p>
      <p>Several people were sworn to give evidence at this week's three-day hearing, but two key witnesses - Paula Ottley and David Wood - refused to do so.</p>
      <p>As a result, coroner Rachel Syed said she was unable to determine the cause of Mr Peers' injuries.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the inquest, Mr Peers' mum Tracey Todd said the last 18 months had been 'hell' for her family.</p>
      <p>"This has destroyed us," she added.</p>
      <p>"There's no closure. I need answers.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who has got information on what happened to Mike, please tell us. As little as it might seem, it might turn out to be big."</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to her son, she said: "Mike was a lovely, funny person. He liked to joke about, I've had some wicked belly laughs with him.</p>
      <p>"He was a performer, a dancer, he didn't care."</p>
      <p>Born in Birkenhead, Mr Peers joined the Army after school and served for three years.</p>
      <p>He later found work as a heating and ventilation engineer, but 'his demons started to get the better of him' several years ago and he turned to alcohol.</p>

      <p>In order to be closer to his mother, he moved to Bolton four-years-ago.</p>
      <p>He was about to become a grandfather at the time of his death.</p>
      <p>During the hearing at Bolton Coroners' Court, Mr Peers was described as a chronic alcoholic with a serious liver disease, who also suffered from depression and other conditions associated with alcoholism.</p>
      <p>The court heard that on the evening of his death, Mr Peers had consumed a large amount of alcohol.</p>
      <p>Earlier that evening, a fight had broken out between him and a neighbour, Ms Ottley, after the latter made a complaint about noise and Mr Peers had gone out to remonstrate.</p>
      <p>The scuffle was broken up by neighbour Christian Condron.</p>
      <p>Mr Peers returned downstairs to his flat, but later came back upstairs 'looking for a fight', but was told to go away by Mr Condron.</p>
      <p>Mr Condron told the hearing Ms Ottley later visited his flat and said there had been another fight and showed him some bruising to her hand.</p>

      <p>Several hours later, paramedics found Mr Peers collapsed and unresponsive on the floor - in the early hours of July 22.</p>
      <p>Hours earlier he had called his mother and told her he had been 'grabbed by the neck and punched'.</p>
      <p>In a later phone call, he told his ex-partner, Suzanne Penny, he had been 'punched' before 'four smackheads upstairs jumped me'.</p>
      <p>But in the phone calls to his mother and former partner, there was no mention of kicking or stamping.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Ms Todd said her son called her at around 10.25pm on Saturday, July 21.</p>
      <p>She said she could hear him arguing and recognised two other voices.</p>
      <p>Ms Todd said he told her he had been punched and said part of what he said in the call was 'I am going to smack him... he has just grabbed me by the neck'.</p>
      <p>The line then cut off.</p>

      <p>Ms Todd said she then rang a woman who was with Mr Peers at the time, who told her 'smackheads were making noise in the hallway' and he went outside and 'told them to shut up', before they 'started on him'.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard the same woman later told Ms Todd she needed to check on him, before claiming he was 'fitting' behind his door.</p>
      <p>Despite 20 minutes of 'life saving protocols', paramedics were unable to save him and he was pronounced dead shortly before 1am.</p>
      <p>Pathologist Dr Charlie Wilson carried out a post-mortem examination on Mr Peers' body.</p>
      <p>He told the hearing he found a tear to the tissues connecting his organs and that Mr Peers had lost almost two litres of blood.</p>
      <p>Mr Wilson said he would usually associate the abdominal injury he found with a road traffic collision or a fall from height.</p>
      <p>He said it was 'typical' of a 'really heavy' kick or stamp onto the abdomen, and that the injuries would leave someone in 'significant pain'.</p>
      <p>However, he stated that the pain may have been numbed due to how much Mr Peers had drunk.</p>
      <p>Dr Wilson added that he could find no evidence 'serious grip marks' on his neck.</p>
      <p>Ms Syed then raised the question of whether Mr Peers might have fallen down a flight of stairs at the flats.</p>

      <p>Returning an open verdict, she said it was 'with great regret' that she was unable to return a verdict of 'unlawful killing' due to a lack of evidence.</p>
      <p>She spoke of a number of practical difficulties, including a lack of CCTV footage in the communal areas at the block of flats.</p>
      <p>Referring to Mr Wood and Ms Ottley's refusal to give evidence, Ms Syed said: "I still believe them to be critical people that could have assisted me.</p>
      <p>"But both purposely withheld critical information from this inquest and invoked their right to silence.</p>
      <p>"Having reconsidered all the evidence, I simply do not know how Mike sustained those traumatic injuries.</p>
      <p>"In fact, the most critical and crucial witness that could explain how he sustained the injuries is Mike himself.</p>
      <p>"He is not here to do that, nor has he made any disclosure to his mum or partner."</p>
      <p>She urged anyone with information on how Mr Peers sustained his injuries to come forward.</p>
      <p>"I am in no doubt that it's heartbreaking for Mike's family. I would ask any members of the public that might have information to contact the police without delay.</p>
      <p>"I would remind members of the public to put themselves in Mike's family's position.</p>
      <p>"If you can assist his family in getting some closure, please do so."</p>
      <h3>Michael’s family and friends deserve answers...</h3>
      <p>Detective Superintendent Jamie Daniels of Greater Manchester Police spoke after the hearing.</p>
      <p>He said: “First and foremost, my deepest condolences and thoughts remain with Michael’s family and friends at this difficult time.</p>
      <p>“Despite their devastation and grief, they have conducted themselves with the utmost dignity and bravery since losing Michael in such tragic circumstances.</p>
      <p>“We strongly suspect that the answers to key questions around how Michael came about his injuries lie with a close-knit community that is aware of what has happened.</p>
      <p>"I would plead with anyone who has information to think about how it would feel to lose a son, a father or a brother and do the right thing and contact the police.</p>
      <p>“Michael’s family and friends deserve answers and I sincerely believe that there is someone in the community who can help them find out what happened to Michael."</p>
