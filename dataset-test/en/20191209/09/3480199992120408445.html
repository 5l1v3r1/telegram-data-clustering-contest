      <p>Boris Johnson has apologised to “everybody who has a bad experience” in the NHS after a four-year-old boy had to sleep on a hospital floor.</p>
      <p>Sarah Williment covered her son, Jack, with coats to keep him warm as he waited for a bed at Leeds General Infirmary, where she had taken him last Tuesday fearing he had pneumonia.</p>
      <p>He was eventually moved to a ward, where he waited for five hours on a trolley before a bed was found at 3am, Ms Williment told the Daily Mirror.</p>
      <p>Diagnosed with flu and tonsillitis, Jack was allowed to be taken home at lunchtime.</p>
      <p>Asked about the incident during an interview on LBC, the Prime Minister said: “Of course I sympathise very much and I apologise to everybody who has a bad experience.</p>
      <p>“By and large I think the NHS do an amazing job and I think that they deserve all praise for the service they provide – but they do need investment and that’s why we’re doing it now.</p>
      <p>“But they need investment from a One Nation government that really cares and understands – that’s us that cares and understands – and you need long-term funding.”</p>
      <p>Ms Williment, 34, told the Mirror she would now switch allegiance and vote Labour in Thursday’s election, owing to her concerns about the state of the NHS.</p>
      <p>She said: “I am frustrated about the system and the lack of beds, which I am presuming is due to a lack of funding to the NHS to deliver the services that are required.”</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister had faced calls to apologise to the family from shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth.</p>
      <p>He said: “Boris Johnson should personally apologise to Jack and his family. A decade of Tory cuts has brought us to this crisis in our NHS.</p>
      <p>“If the Tories win on Thursday, patients including children will suffer five more years of this. We need a Labour government to save our NHS.”</p>
