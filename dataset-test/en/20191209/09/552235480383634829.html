      <p>In a rivalry so contentious it's no surprise that the refereeing decision that settled the match has caused so much conjecture and debate.</p>
      <p>TV coverage left little doubt on most people's minds that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christopher-jullien">Christopher Jullien</a> 's winner should have been ruled out for offside but in the aftermath of the game, stills have emerged claiming to show that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/filip-helander">Filip Helander</a> had played the goalscorer onside.</p>
      <p>Pictures show that the Ibrox defender is hidden from view in front of Jullien but his arm is clearly visible and in line with the furthest body part of the onrushing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> players.</p>

      <p>In this image you can see when the ball is struck, Helander's arm is in line with the attacking Hoops stars. Some think this means Edouard is onside.</p>
      <p>However, the IFAB laws of the game state a player is in an offside position if:</p>
      <p>
        <b> - any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half (excluding the halfway line) and</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> - any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The hands and arms of all players, including the goalkeepers, are not considered.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A player is not in an offside position if level with the:</p>
      <p>It is clear from the images that it is Helander's arm is the only thing playing the Celtic players onside and that it would be impossible for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> defender's shoulder to be postioned in a way that plays anyone onside in his postiton.</p>
