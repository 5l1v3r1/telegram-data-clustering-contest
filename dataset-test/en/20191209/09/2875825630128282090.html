      <h1>Conor McGregor UFC News: Notorious lifts weights and trains boxing ahead of Cerrone fight</h1>
      <h2>The Irishman returns to the octagon on January 18th</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:34:10+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/donagh-corby/" target="_blank">Donagh Corby</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> has geared up his training as his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ufc">UFC</a> return date draws ever closer.</p>
      <p>The Irishman is expected to return to the octagon on January 18th at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas against legendary MMA fighter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/donald-cerrone">Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone</a> .</p>
      <p>And the ex-two weight world title holder has taken to Instagram to share a number of photos showing his intensive preparation, that includes weight lifting in his gym and boxing rounds at Crumlin Boxing Club.</p>
      <p>Posting yesterday, he revealed that he had just done almost an hour of sparring at the famous boxing gym, saying: "14 rounds completed today at the School of Excellence, Crumlin Boxing Club."</p>

      <p>And later 'The Notorious' shared photos of himself and trainers as he pushed himself to lift weights as part of his 'McGregor FAST' training programe.</p>
      <p>McGregor is expected to turn his sights to Jorge Masvidal if he defeats Donald Cerrone in January. </p>
      <p>This is the according to UFC chief Dana White who has also not ruled out a rematch between <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/khabib-nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> in the new year.</p>
      <p>White told 101.6FM in Washington: "Conor has told me he definitely wants a fight with Masvidal, so we'll see what happens."</p>
      <p>McGregor will make his long-awaited return against Cerrone on January 18 - over a year since his loss to lightweight king Nurmagomedov in Las Vegas. </p>

      <p>And White sees a scenario where the Crumlin man could get the rematch he craves against the Russian in 2020.</p>
      <p>"A couple of things have got to happen first; he's got to beat 'Cowboy' Cerrone which is a very tough fight, especially at 170 without 'Cowboy' having to cut weight. </p>
      <p>"Then Khabib has to beat Tony Ferguson. If both of those things happen then yeah I think we can make the rematch. </p>
      <p>"[McGregor] would rather take that fight right now and not fight 'Cowboy', he wants that fight really bad.</p>
      <p>"In reality Rich it would be the biggest pay per view ever in the history of the sport."</p>
