      <p>After her show, she took to her photo-sharing site Instagram and posted a picture of herself in a made in Ghana bikini with the caption talking about her short stay in Ghana.</p>
      <p>She posted: <i>“I was in Ghana for less then 24 hours .Went thru a lil dilemma but I still had fun”</i></p>
