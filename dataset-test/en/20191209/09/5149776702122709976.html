      <h1>Nottingham charity given green light to move from 'decrepit' home after 60 years</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Mencap has been in consultation to move into the Edwards Lane Community Centre</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:32:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Pridmore</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/restaurant-fire-closes-queen-street-3618466">Nottingham</a> charity which helps people with learning difficulties has taken a "huge step forward" after being given the green light to move into a new facility.</p>
      <p>Nottingham Mencap has been based at its current facility in Harpenden House in Nottingham for more than 60 years but has been in consultation about a move after the building was described as being "beyond economic repair".</p>
      <p>The charity supports people with autism and learning difficulties by helping them develop practical and social skills to live independently.</p>
      <p>Now, Mencap has welcomed the "very exciting" news that work should begin on a new facility next Autumn.</p>
      <p>Mike Tuck, the Project Director at Richardson Hall Construction, who will be leading the work, said: "This is welcome news for a fantastic organisation doing some incredibly important work.</p>

      <p>"Their current building is beyond economic repair therefore rebuilding there wasn’t going to be an option.</p>
      <p>"This is a significant project as we aren’t simply upgrading a facility, we are relocating an organisation and helping them to expand their services to deliver a truly 21st century provision for their users."</p>
      <p>The new facility will be based at the Edwards Lane Community Centre in Sherwood and plans include it being equipped with a gymnasium, a music room and an IT suite.</p>
      <p>The community centre is currently in need of repair but once re-built the charity plans to open it up to people in the surrounding area.</p>

      <p>Work is expected to begin on site next autumn and be completed by the spring of 2021.</p>
      <p>Mike Caston, CEO of Nottingham Mencap said: "This is a huge step forward for this ambitious project and a very exciting time for all of us here at Nottingham Mencap but especially for our service users.</p>
      <p>"Our current venue has served us well for many years but not only is it frankly somewhat decrepit, it is totally outmoded for today’s needs.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank Mike Tuck and the team at Richardson Hall Construction for their invaluable strategic advice and support right from the start of this project and look forward to working with him as we take the next steps on this ambitious but absolutely essential journey."</p>
