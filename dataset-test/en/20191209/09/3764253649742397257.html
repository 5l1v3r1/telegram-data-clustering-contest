        <b>Eberechi Eze was Queens Park Rangers hero when they defeated Peston North End by 2-0 in an EFL Championship game played at Loftus Road.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Nigerian-born England midfielder for the second time in a week improved his goalscoring form for the London club.</p>
      <p>Eze broke the deadlock in the 17th minute as he latched on to a through ball as he shot straight at the goalkeeper and pounced on the second attempt to make it 1-0.</p>

      <p>For the second time in a week, QPR were awarded a penalty and the 21-year-old took the responsibility and converted the resulting spot-kick to make it 2-0 in the 67th minute.</p>
      <p>Eze has now taken his tally to nine goals from 20 league matches this season and he has been the Hoops best player so far.</p>
      <p>And Eze's two goals was enough to earn the Loftus Road outfit all three points as they move to 14th on the table while Preston dropped out of the promotion places to seventh on the log.</p>
