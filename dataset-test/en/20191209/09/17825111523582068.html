      <p>Pretoria - Heavy rains are a cause for concern as low lying bridges and other areas are flooded and traffic has ground to a halt on various roads in the City of Tshwane.</p>
      <p>Tshwane motorists, in particular those driving in the flood prone suburb of Centurion, have been moving at tortoise pace as the rain renders numerous rads unsafe to drive on.</p>
      <p>Pedestrians also had their fair share of challenges as many could be seen trying to jump over flooded areas.</p>
      <p>Traffic congestion was caused by accidents that occurred on busy roads like the N1 highway through Centurion.  </p>
