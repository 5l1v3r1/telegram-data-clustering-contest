      <p>This morning the party unveiled plans for “ready-to-go” legislation for a second referendum immediately after the election.</p>
      <p>The plans involve two draft bills – a ‘Paving Bill’ to begin consultation around a referendum question and establish campaign designation, and a a full bill, which would provide for a referendum on the current deal or staying in the European Union.</p>
