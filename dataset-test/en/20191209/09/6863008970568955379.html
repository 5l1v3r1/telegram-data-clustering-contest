      <p>"We are going there, first of all, for the sake of our prisoners held in Russian prisons and for the sake of our citizens in the occupied territories. Our main red line, from which we will not retreat even a millimeter, is the internationally recognized state border of Ukraine," Prystaiko <a href="https://twitter.com/VPrystaiko/status/1203707454346973190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1203707454346973190&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unian.net%2Fpolitics%2F10785389-glava-mid-pered-normandskoy-vstrechey-nazval-glavnuyu-krasnuyu-liniyu-ukrainy.html">wrote </a>on Twitter.</p>
