      <p>Large European companies are shifting manufacturing supply chains to avoid China-US tariffs while smaller ones are weathering the extra costs, a European business lobby said on Monday.</p>
      <p>And while some companies have shifted investment out of China, around the same number have increased investment in the country to produce more locally and avoid tariffs crossing borders, said a report by the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=European+Union">European Union</a> Chamber of Commerce in China. This undercuts the US goal of discouraging investment in China, the report said.</p>
      <p>European companies are “settling in” to the trade war, chamber president <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Joerg+Wuttke">Joerg Wuttke</a> told reporters on Monday.</p>
      <p>The 17-month long trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies have hit global supply chains, business investment plans and market confidence, but Washington and Beijing are working on a first phase agreement to lower trade tensions.</p>
      <p>While some small- and medium-sized European companies, especially those that make very high-quality goods, are able to pass costs from higher tariffs along, others are taking a “steady beating,” said the report.</p>
      <p>Mr Wuttke had little hope the ‘phase one’ deal could benefit other countries by affecting systemic issues such as subsidies and market access in the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
      <p>China and the US are trying to hash out the interim deal before a new round of tariffs kicks in on December 15th, covering about $156 billion of Chinese imports.</p>
      <p>“Maybe my children will see a ‘phase two’,” said Mr Wuttke, referring to a more ambitious later-stage deal which might touch on more structural issues.</p>
      <p>While larger European firms can manage US-China trade tensions, they are not managing to take advantage of it, Mr Wuttke said. “I have not seen a single case where we benefited.”</p>
