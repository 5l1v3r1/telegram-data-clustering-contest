      <p>A boutique owner was left stunned by an order from Buckingham Palace for a vegan fur scarf.  </p>
      <p>Jenny Mason, who runs 100 per cent vegan, PETA approved, The Haven Home Interiors, was thrilled to receive the request for the £111 blue faux fur stole.</p>
      <p>It comes after the news the Queen has shunned real fur, with all future outfits designed for the monarch made from an alternative material.</p>

      <p>Jenny supplies a variety of vegan fur clothes as well as home interiors both online and from her shop in Cheshire, with a percentage of profits going towards her wildlife sanctuary Haven_Watch.</p>
      <p>Jenny said: 'We are not sure at this point who may be lucky enough to showcase the beautiful scarf, but to receive an order from the Palace left us all elated.</p>
      <p>'The fact that faux fur is now on the rise and for the someone from the Palace to potentially be including our items in their wardrobe is truly wonderful.'</p>
      <p>Jenny said what makes her clothing vegan is that the material is 100 per cent acrylic and designed and made in England.</p>

        <figcaption>The order for the vegan fur scarf comes after the news the Queen has shunned real fur, with all future outfits designed for the monarch made from an alternative material. The Queen came under fire from animal rights campaigners in 2010 for wearing a cream-coloured fur hat made from fox hair when she attended church at Sandringham on Christmas day</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She said: 'The vegan "fur" fabrics that make up the scarf are 100 per cent acrylic; each fibre or "hair" is highly polished, which is what makes the fabrics so soft and silky - and feel just like real fur.</p>
      <p>'Many fur scarves can state "faux fur" but often when goods have been made in China, for example, real dog, cat or rabbit fur is often used.</p>
      <p>'To ensure a genuine faux fur product, buying from trusted UK made and sourced brands is recommended.</p>
      <p>'Each faux fur accessory has been designed and made in England by a dedicated team, who firmly believe in quality and attention to detail. Every cut is considered, every stitch concise.'</p>

      <p>Jenny said her company is very eco-conscious, and does what it can to reduce the long-distance supply chain when it comes to sourcing goods, which minimises the environmental impact of its products.</p>
      <p>'We are a PETA approved 100 per cent vegan friendly business @The Haven Home Interiors, with a percentage of proceeds going towards our self-run wildlife rescue Haven_watch,' she added.</p>
      <p>'We have a huge range of divine vegan furs, along with lots of other delights for your home or wardrobe.'</p>

      <p>The Queen's senior dresser Angela Kelly - also the head of state's personal adviser and confidante - revealed Her Majesty switched to fake fur this year in her book about her close relationship with the monarch, The Other Side Of The Coin. </p>
      <p>She wrote: 'If Her Majesty is due to attend an engagement in particularly cold weather, from 2019 onwards fake fur will be used to make sure she stays warm.'</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace confirmed the move to FEMAIL, saying: 'As new outfits are designed for the Queen, any fur used will be fake.' </p>

        <figcaption>The Queen will not be buying more clothes containing real fur, the palace has said. She is pictured here wearing a brown fur coat when she attended church in Norfolk in 2015 on Christmas day, and wearing a fur coat in 1963</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The palace 'would not speculate' on whether any fur coats already owned by the Queen could still be worn, or if the change will extend to the monarch's historic robe of state.</p>
      <p>This consists of an ermine and velvet cape, which is worn at the State Opening of Parliament.</p>
      <p>The move is believed to make the Queen the first member of the royal family to publicly shun real fur.</p>

      <h3>Have other royals worn real fur?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall</b>
      </p>
      <p>Camilla was photographed wearing a brown hat made of real fur in 2010.</p>
      <p>The Duchess donned the 'ostentatious' garment for a Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham.</p>
      <p>In 2017, it was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5223745/Duchess-Cornwall-switches-fake-fur-after"><b>reported </b></a>that the Duchess had switched to fake fur following the barrage of criticism she received for sporting the Russian-style hat.</p>
      <p>She was rumoured to have purchased six bespoke faux fur-trimmed hats from upmarket firm Lock &amp; Co - and was seen proudly wearing one during Christmas that year. </p>

        <figcaption>The Duchess was roundly berated after she wore the real fur hat in 2010 for a Christmas day church service at St Mary Magdalene in Sandringham, and is now said to have sworn off real fur for good</figcaption>

      <p>Kate has been pictured wearing fur hats made from alpacas who have died of natural causes.</p>
      <p>The Duchess was seen in a chestnut brown £225 Sumac hat by Lacorine, made in Peru under the fairtrade label by local artisans, when she visited Oslo last year.</p>

      <p>The royal was also seen wearing a black alpaca fur hat earlier that same week when she visited the Nobel Museum in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>Kate and Prince William were slammed by animal rights activists in 2016 when they were shown wearing otter fur scarves they had been given while visiting the First Nations Haida Community during an official tour of Canada.</p>
      <p>The scarves were given by the tribe as a sign of welcome and respect.</p>
      <p>The Duchess has also been criticised for wearing fake fur hats when they have been identified as real fur.</p>
      <p>The International Fur Trade Federation accused her of wearing an animal fur bobble hat when she was pictured in the garment in London in 2012.</p>
      <p>However, Buckingham Palace quickly corrected them, and revealed the hat was, in fact, fake fur.</p>

      <p>Meghan has never been pictured wearing real fur, and has even been heralded as vegan-fashion royalty by animal rights activists.</p>
      <p>The Duchess was said to be strongly opposed to wearing in real fur in 2018 by her close friend Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, who works in talent management, reports the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/meghan-markle-fur-clothing-opposition-beliefs-feminism-dorchester-latest-news-a8306831.html"><b>Independent</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old, who worked as the royal's commercial agent for two years, revealed Meghan has a strict no-fur policy.</p>
      <p>She is also said to love vegan leather, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/02/meghan-markle-reveals-passion-vegan-leather-trousers-roast-chicken/"><b>Good Housekeeping</b></a>.</p>
      <p>During an interview with the publication, she said: 'Personally, I love cropped pants in vegan leather, a great fitted blazer and a button-down [shirt].' </p>
