      <p>Former Leeds United defender Danny Mills has hit out at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> target Eddie Nketiah, calling him the worst Whites player this season so far.</p>
      <p>Nketiah has struggled for game time this season and is yet to make his first start in the Championship, but Mills argues that his lack of minutes on the pitch isn't just down to unfortunate circumstances.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/leeds-exclusive-danny-mills-tears-into-eddie-nketiah/">Speaking to Football Insider</a>, when asked who the worst <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/huge-prediction-made-championship-race-3622283">Leeds United</a> player so far this season has been, Mills said: <i>“</i> You have to say Eddie Nketiah. He came in with a big reputation, had a good record at Arsenal for their U23s and in cup games.</p>
      <p>“Scored in cup games, did okay when coming on but hasn’t done it when given extended run-outs and full halves.</p>

      <p>“He has had limited opportunities, but we haven’t really seen much from him when he’s had those opportunities.</p>
      <p>“And when you come from a big club with a big reputation, you have to perform, and you’d have to say if anyone has been below par, it’s Eddie Nketiah based on the performances he has had.”</p>
      <p>The young forward has been linked with a recall from his loan spell at Leeds, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-arsenal-eddie-nketiah-3620792">despite the Sun recently reporting</a> that Arsenal are happy for him to stay there.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-lee-johnson-transcript-3620492">Bristol City</a> are one of the clubs who are keen on the striker should he be recalled after they narrowly missed out on a deal for him in the summer.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_bristol">BBC Radio Bristol</a> at the end of November, City CEO Mark Ashton said: "He’s a very talented player.</p>
      <p>"Should he become available he would be someone we would definitely consider if the fit was right and we were able to do it.</p>
      <p>"It would be remiss of us to have someone like him as the only option."</p>
      <p>Nketiah has scored 5 goals in 12 appearances for Leeds so far this season.</p>
