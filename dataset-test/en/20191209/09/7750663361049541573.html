      <p>Since arriving at the North London outfit in November, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> has insisted that he will not look to make major changes during the January window.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Dhnet</i>, the Portuguese is interested in securing a reunion with a player who he worked with during his time at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The report claims that contact was recently made with the Belgium international, who now plays for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/shandong-luneng-taishan/"><b>Shandong Luneng Taishan</b></a> in the Chinese Super League.</p>
      <p>While it is suggested that the 32-year-old remains happy with Taishan, Mourinho is said to be prioritising a player of Fellaini's style and stature.</p>
      <p>With two years still remaining on his contract, Taishan remain in a strong position to keep hold of one of their star men.</p>
