      <p>Orlando - <b>Bernhard Langer</b> and son, <b>Jason</b>, fired a round of 60 (-12) before clinching victory with a dramatic eagle on the first hole of sudden death over Team Goosen and Team Lehman at the 2019 <b>Father Son Challenge</b> at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club Orlando.</p>
      <p>Only two partnerships in the last 14 years have prevailed when trailing overnight, but that did not stop Team Langer, who came from two strokes behind to lift the coveted Will Park Trophy with a spectacular eagle back at No. 18.  </p>
      <p>Langer is now solo second in the all-time list of tournament winners behind Raymond Floyd (5).</p>
      <p>On a low scoring morning in Orlando, it was Team Daly that made an early run up the leaderboard, going seven under through seven holes, before the lead switched hands between the overnight leaders Team Goosen, Team Langer and Team Lehman.  </p>
      <p>A three-time winner here at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, including once with Jason in 2014, Langer matched Lehman's opening nine of 29 to lead by one at the turn, with Team Goosen a further one adrift.   </p>
      <p>Trading blows throughout the back nine, Team Lehman birdied Nos. 17 and 18 to post the clubhouse lead at 24-under-par, only for Team Goosen and Team Langer to join them with closing birdies of their own. </p>
      <p>Cue the fifth playoff in tournament history and first since 2015.</p>
      <p>With all six players heading back down the par 5 18th hole, the crowds knew it would take something special to break the deadlock.</p>
      <p>Jason Langer stepped up. </p>
      <p>Taking his father's drive in the fairway, 19-year-old Jason hit a 270 yard 3-wood to 16ft before calmly rolling in the putt to break the deadlock at the first time of asking. </p>
      <p>Commenting on the victory, Langer said, "I've seen clutch shots in majors and Ryder Cups, all over the place. For our family it doesn't get much better than that one."</p>
      <p>Leading overnight and always gracious in defeat, Goosen said, "Almost in this game, unfortunately, doesn't count. We've finished second in this event three times now in the last four years. It's a little disappointing to me. Playoffs have not been kind to me this year. I feel bad for my son, because we were unfortunately on the losing end."</p>
