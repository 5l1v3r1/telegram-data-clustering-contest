      <h1>James Maddison 'on brink of signing new Leicester deal' amid Man Utd transfer interest</h1>
      <h2>Leicester are hopeful of persuading Maddison to extend his current contract to ward off Man Utd, after manager Brendan Rodgers committed his future to the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:35:04+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/james-maddison">James Maddison</a> is reportedly on the verge of agreeing a new contract at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> amid interest from Man Utd.</p>
      <p>The Foxes midfielder has impressed since moving from Norwich last season, earning himself a first international call-up in the process.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> have been consistently linked with a move for the 23-year-old, but Leicester have tabled the offer of a new deal to ward off the Red Devils' interest.</p>
      <p>Maddison still has over three years left to run on his current deal, but Leicester are confident he will sign an extension to remain with the club.</p>

      <p>Both Maddison and Soyuncu have played pivotal roles in Leicester's surge up the league table this season, with the Foxes currently providing the biggest challenge to Liverpool's title charge.</p>
      <p>Soyuncu has been a revelation at centre-back since replacing Harry Maguire, who moved to United.</p>
      <p>Man City have been tracking the progress of the Turkish defender but Leicester feel a new contract will help persuade Soyuncu his future lies at the King Power stadium.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile boss Rodgers has fired a warning to league leaders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , following his side's emphatic 4-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Two goals from Jamie Vardy helped Leicester rack up a club record eighth Premier League win on the bounce, and Rodgers is keen for their run to continue.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the match, he said: "I thought they were amazing, it is a historical day for the club and the performance warranted that.</p>
      <p>"It really does mean something special, it puts the team in the history books of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City.</p>
      <p>"We will just concentrate on playing as well as we can and with a performance level as high as we can.</p>
      <p>"Wherever we are in the table we always look to chase the team in front of us, we look for us to keep pushing, keep fighting and keep developing. We will always do our best."</p>
      <p>Leicester host Liverpool in the 8pm kick-off on Boxing Day in what is now a crunch fixture in the Premier League calendar.</p>
