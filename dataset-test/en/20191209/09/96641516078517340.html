      <h1>'Twin Peaks VR' trailer offers a dive into David Lynch's mind</h1>
      <h2>It is happening again.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:23:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>If you suspected that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/04/twin-peaks-vr-will-take-you-inside-the-mind-bending-red-room/"><i>Twin Peaks VR</i></a> would be a head trip, you guessed correctly. Collider and Showtime have released a <a href="https://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/twin-peaks-vr/">trailer</a> for the series' official virtual reality experience ahead of its debut later in December, and it feels like a mirror of David Lynch's psyche with the same strangeness as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/09/showtime-twin-peaks-premiere/">the series</a>. The return to the Red Room is really just one part of your journey -- you'll also return to the train car where Laura Palmer was killed, a log cabin (but whose?) and Sheriff Truman's office, complete with an unsettling Killer BOB orb. It's clear this is tailor-made for the sort of fan who could quote whole scenes verbatim.</p>
      <p>As mentioned before, you'll need a PC, Steam and an HTC- or Oculus-made headset. Versions for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/30/oculus-quest-review-wireless-vr/">Oculus Quest</a> and PlayStation VR are due in the future, though, in case you'd prefer to experience Lynchian oddities in your living room.</p>
      <p>Don't expect this to be a full-fledged game. You can find Easter eggs and "discover hidden secrets," but this is more of a guided tour through iconic places in the <i>Twin Peaks</i> universe than anything else. That might be more than enough if you're a devotee, though, and it's just a question of whether or not the full title can come close to replicating the atmosphere of the show.</p>
