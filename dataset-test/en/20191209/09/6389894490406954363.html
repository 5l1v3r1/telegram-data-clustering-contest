      <p>The Cybertruck, made by Tesla, has caused a stir in the automotive industry since its launch on Thursday, with its unconventional shape and hefty $39,900 price tag making it a target for widespread criticism. </p>
      <p>The car’s trapezoid shape has also been the subject of mockery via internet memes. However, Tesla fans have also praised Musk for bringing a new shape in automotive design to the market.</p>
