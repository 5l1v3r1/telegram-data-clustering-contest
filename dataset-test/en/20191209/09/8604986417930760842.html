      <h1>Google Introduces Beta Explanations that Can Explain Smaller Issues with SEO Marketing Campaigns</h1>
      <h2>New system can be used by SEO marketers to identify issues that lead to ups and down in SEO management.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:45:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Roesler</a></address>
      <p>During the holiday season, there are many ways for consumers to use Google AdWords and other marketing tools from Google to improve a website. Though Google uses these signals to help SEO marketers create better performing campaigns, many of these programs leave errors that can be affected by the website in question. Google will attempt to make it easier for SEO experts to understand why a social media site isn't having the results that a website owner wants to see.</p>
      <p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9569021?hl=en">According to a statement left behind by Google Ads</a>, the system will leave clues about why a certain campaign doesn't have an issue with the website owners. Google Ads stated that "Understanding why your performance changes is critical when optimizing a campaign. However, it can be time-consuming to diagnose why your metrics can fluctuate. To help you understand some performance changes in your campaigns and ad groups faster, you can now request explanations."</p>
      <p>Despite the promise from Google Ads, there are issues that website owners should keep in mind when searching for the cause behind a particular up or down movement on a site, there are several factors to keep in mind. </p>
      <p>First, the new explanations are only currently available for manual CPC or eCPC Search campaigns. There are many ways to run an SEO campaign and in most cases, alternative advertising methods won't be used by Google Ads to make a decision about the past.  </p>
      <p>Whenever you try to make comparisons that can help SEO marketers understand a situation, it's important to measure apples to apples. To prevent the system from trying to make inaccurate explanations, it can compare two time periods of equal length within the last 90 days. </p>
      <p>Finally, the system is designed to showcase explanations that are only for campaigns with significant performance changes. The system is relatively new, and it may be a while before Google Ads is ready to dig deep into the weeds to locate potential issues that could affect an AdWords campaign.</p>
      <p>It's worth remembering that this new feature is still in the beta stage. Your mileage may vary, so SEO experts shouldn't be heading into the situation with a lot of potential questions they want to see answered. At this early stage, website owners will need to keep on their thinking caps for looking at issues that could affect the spread of their AdWords campaign. </p>
      <p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9569021?hl=en">According to Google</a>, SEO marketers should pay attention to these changes to get a better understanding of their overall SEO campaign. Some of the issues that can show up in these explanations include, "a view of the most likely reasons for impression, click, and cost changes with the click of a button. This [system] makes it easy for you to spend more time focusing on optimization, and less time investigating performance issues. For example, let's say you notice a big week-over-week drop in impressions for one of your campaigns. Rather than diving into multiple reports to find out what happened, you can just click on the "See Explanations" button on your campaign and ad group tables while in time comparison mode."</p>
      <p>Even though the system has limited accuracy, it's worthwhile for SEO marketers to use these tools to better understand their social media ad campaigns. </p>
