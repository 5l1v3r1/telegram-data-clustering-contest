      <p>TAMPA, Fla. â€” As you make your way to relatives homes this season or relatives visit you, make sure to connect with those who are getting older.</p>
      <p>Experts say the holidays are a good time to look for signs of dementia or that your loved one simply can't care for themselves as well.</p>
      <p>"Number one would be appearance. What do their clothes look like, how's their personal hygiene?" says Licensed Clinical Social Worker Peter Lally at Tampa Family Jewish Services.</p>
      <p>Lally says it's also important to ask family members about their mood and look for safety concerns. Also, if you are visiting their house, check their car for scratches and dents and look around for stacks of unopened bills.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Lally says it's important to offer options and not advice. He says a lot of times people fear being put in a living facility.</p>
      <p>He says it is a difficult transition for your family member so the conversations need to be direct and to the point. But, also reaching out to a third party, like a social worker, could be a good option.</p>
