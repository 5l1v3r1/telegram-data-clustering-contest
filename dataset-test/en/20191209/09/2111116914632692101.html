      <p>If you didn't manage to pin down that perfect <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/headphone-deals">headphones deal</a> over Black Friday, you haven't missed your chance – as these <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sennheiser-momentum-free">Sennheiser Momentum Free</a> Special Edition in-ear headphones are back at their lowest price ever.</p>
      <p>At just £69.99, down from an original £179.99 RRP, you're saving over a hundred pounds for high-quality audio in a stylish Sennheiser package – all the better for being the black-and-red Special Edition exclusive to Amazon.</p>
      <p>This deal is now live at Amazon until midnight on December 22, 2019 – or until stock on this offer runs out.</p>

      <h4>Wireless or true wireless?</h4>
      <p>Sure, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-true-wireless-earbuds-the-best-airpod-alternatives-around">true wireless earbuds</a> are all the rage these days, and you may find yourself drifting towards the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-review">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless</a> instead, which currently sit at around £199. </p>
      <p>But if you aren't fussed about completely untethered audio, the Momentum Free earphones will still offer top-notch audio, just with a connected cable and in-line remote (which is somewhat more practical than the True Wireless model's touch controls, anyhow).</p>
      <p>This model has been on the market for almost two years now, though, so you will be getting the slightly older Bluetooth 4.2 standard – rather than the latest 5.0 standard, which is more power-efficient and boasts a greater wireless range.</p>
