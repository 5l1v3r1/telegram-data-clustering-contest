      <p>Although the exact details of the plot are being kept under lock and key for now, we know that the superhero will have to face off against well-known Wonder Woman nemesis Cheetah, who will be played by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kristen-wiig/">Kristen Wiig</a> in the new film. Although the trailer shows Kristen’s character Barbara Minerva and Diana chatting over a glass of wine, WW fans will know this friendship is doomed.</p>
