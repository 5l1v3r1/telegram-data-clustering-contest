      <p>A 22-year-old woman makes herself vomit by inserting a tube into her stomach through her mouth in order to lose weight.</p>
      <p>This has been an unhealthy trend thatâ€™s been going on in China where a community of girls actually discuss the â€˜tips and tricksâ€™ they can use to lose weight, including inserting a thin and long plastic tube through their oesophagus to induce vomiting.</p>

      <p>This particular woman who frequently uses this method accidentally swallowed the whole tube and it became stuck in her oesophagus!</p>
      <p>She went to the doctor on 3rd December and lied to him saying that she accidentally swallowed a drinking straw. But when the doctor noticed that the object was too deep to reach, he immediately performed an upper gastrointestinal tract radiography â€“ an x-ray of the oesophagus.</p>
      <p>The doctor then discovered the foreign object in her body which measured about 1.9cm wide and 30cm long. He immediately knew it wasnâ€™t a drinking straw and pressed the woman for the truth, reported <a href="https://www.chinapress.com.my/20191208/%e5%87%8f%e8%82%a5%e8%af%af%e5%90%9e%e5%82%ac%e5%90%90%e7%ae%a1-%e5%a5%b3%e5%ad%90%e6%b1%82%e8%af%8a%e9%aa%97%e5%8c%bb%e7%94%9f%e6%98%af%e5%90%b8%e7%ae%a1/">China Press</a>.</p>

      <p>She then told him that she purchased the tube online, and she had been using it to lose weight.</p>
      <p>The x-ray showed that the bottom end of the tube was inside the womanâ€™s stomach, pressing against the stomach wall while the other end was near her voice box with a jagged tip.</p>
      <p>After the doctor managed to remove the tube, he performed a gastroscopy on the woman and found that there were ulcers in her stomach wall and oesophagus.</p>

      <p>The doctor then mentioned that this is the first case where a â€˜vomiting tubeâ€™ was accidentally swallowed.</p>
      <p>He said that those who use this â€˜techniqueâ€™ to lose weight face the risk of getting gastroesophageal and pharyngeal mucosal damage. In the long run, patients like this can also experience neurological problems and even involuntary movement of the limbs.</p>

        <i>Surely inserting foreign objects into your body canâ€™t be very safe for you and your health. There are many other ways to lose weight, but taking a shortcut should not be one of them!</i>
