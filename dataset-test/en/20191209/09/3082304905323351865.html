        <b>Tiger Woods and the United States aim to put Patrick Reed’s Hero World Challenge controversy behind them at the Presidents Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>United States captain Tiger Woods revealed he had warned Patrick Reed of a potentially hostile reception in Australia as his team try to keep their focus on the Presidents Cup.</p>
      <p>Woods is leading – and playing for – the USA against Ernie Els’ International team this week, but Reed, a captain’s pick, has been at the centre of controversy coming into the tournament.</p>
      <p>The former Masters champion was dealt a two-stroke penalty at the Hero World Challenge – hosted by Woods in the Bahamas – for hacking away at the sand around his ball in the third round.</p>
      <p>Reed was punished for “removing or pressing down sand or loose soil” and agonisingly finished two shots behind victor Henrik Stenson.</p>
      <p>Woods is wary of potential backlash from rival supporters in the coming days, but he hopes the incident can be quickly forgotten.</p>
      <p>“The fans we have down here are awesome and they are into their sport,” the 15-time major champion said. “Yes, I have talked to Pat about it.</p>

      <p>“But that is behind us and we are focused on this week, on trying to go up against this great International team here.</p>
      <p>“As we all know, Pat was penalised. That was it. The end of story. Unfortunately, he missed the play-off by two shots, but we are all in it this week getting ready for the Internationals.”</p>
      <p>It is unclear yet how much involvement Woods will have as a playing captain at the Cup, but opposite number Els expects him to have an impact.</p>
      <p>“[Having a playing captain] hasn’t been done in quite a few years,” Els said. “There will be a lot of help for him.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see how it goes. I don’t know how many sessions he’s going to play. Obviously he’s a big asset to their team.</p>
      <p>“We can only do what we do, control what we can control, play the way we want to play, and hopefully that’s good enough.”</p>
