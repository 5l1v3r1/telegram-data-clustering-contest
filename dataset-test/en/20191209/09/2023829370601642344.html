      <p>The body of the girl, who was missing since December 6, was found on an agriculture farm in Linga village in Kalmeshwar taluka, some 25 kms away from Nagpur.</p>
      <p>"The arrested accused, Sanjay Puri, also works as a farm labourer like the parents of the girl in the farm," Superintendent of Police, Nagpur Rural, Rakesh Ola told PTI. Puri is a resident of Mohgaon village in the district.</p>
      <p>The SP said police have registered a case under sections 376 (Punishment for rape), 363 (Punishment for kidnapping), 302 (Punishment for murder) besides under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. A local court on Monday remanded the accused in police custody till December 13.</p>
      <p>According to police, parents of the girl live on the one side of the agriculture farm while her grandmother on the another side, with a small path connecting both the houses.</p>
      <p>"The girl went missing on Friday evening. Initially, her parents assumed that she might have gone to the house of her grandmother. However, they lodged a missing person complaint on Saturday afternoon after realising that she was not traceable," a police official had said.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, residents of Kalmeshwar organised rallies and called for a bandh to protest the brutal murder of the girl. Main markets remained closed since morning after people took to streets to condemn the incident and demanded speedy justice.</p>
