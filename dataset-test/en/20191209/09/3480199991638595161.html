      <p>Tigers were beaten 5-2 on Saturday with Ross Kennedy and Fin Howells netting for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Head coach Tom Watkins said: “It doesn’t matter where you play now on the road, it’s tough to win and pick up points.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good sign that the league is competitive every night.</p>
      <p>“We started very well, our transition was slick and we created some quality chances but didn’t capitalise on them.</p>
      <p>“That was frustrating as I felt we probably should have taken a lead out of the first period.</p>
      <p>“I think the five-on-three powerplay changed the game, it gave Milton Keynes a lift and they certainly stole a march on us.</p>
      <p>“(Lightning netminder) Dean Skinns played a strong game, but we managed to get ourselves back in it only to shoot ourselves in the foot after we had scored a couple of powerplay goals.”</p>
      <p>Scott McKenzie hit the crossbar for Tigers in the first period and Lightning’s Liam Stewart hit the post.</p>
      <p>At the start of the second period James Griffin and Grant McPherson received penalties, giving Tigers a five-on-three powerplay.</p>
      <p>But Watkins’ side were unable to take advantage and soon after Robin Kovar put the home side ahead.</p>
      <p>Things got worse for Tigers as Lightning scored again minutes later, Stewart finishing from Kovar’s pass. Tigers got on the scoresheet at the start of the third period with a powerplay goal after Kennedy hit a slap shot from long range that flew past the unsighted Skinns.</p>
      <p>Tigers were then undone on a Milton Keynes powerplay after Thomas McKinnon was sent to the penalty box for high sticking, Stewart scoring his second of the game.</p>
      <p>Tigers fought back and Howells netted with a well placed wrist shot after being found by McKenzie.</p>
      <p>But Tigers’ hopes were dashed once again when Stewart completed his hat-trick with a wrap around shot.</p>
      <p>The final action saw Tigers pull Brad Day from goal to gain an extra attacker, but this backfired when Stewart tapped into an empty net to seal the victory.</p>
