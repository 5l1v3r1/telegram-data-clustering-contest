        <b>A wealthy Lebanese-Swiss businessman said Sunday he had bought Adolf Hitler's top hat and other Nazi artifacts to give them to Jewish groups and prevent them falling into the hands of a resurgent far-right.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Abdallah Chatila said he had felt compelled to take the objects off the market because of the rising anti-Semitism, populism and racism he was witnessing in Europe.</p>
      <p>He spent about 600,000 euros ($660,000) for eight objects connected to Hitler, including the collapsible top hat, in a November 20 sale at a Munich auction house, originally planning to burn them all.</p>
      <p>But he then decided to give them to the Keren Hayesod association, an Israeli fundraising group, which has resolved to hand them to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial centre.</p>
      <p>Chatila told a Jerusalem press conference it had been a "very easy" decision to purchase the items when he saw the "potentially lethal injustice that those artefacts would go to the wrong hands".Â </p>
      <p>"I felt I had no choice but to actually try to help the cause," he added.</p>
      <p>"What happened in the last five years in Europe showed us that anti-Semitism, that populism, that racism is going stronger and stronger, and we are here to fight it and show people we're not scared.</p>
      <p>"Today -- with the fake news, with the media, with the power that people could have with the internet, with social media -- somebody else could use that small window" of time to manipulate the public, he said.</p>
      <p>He said he had worried the Nazi-era artefacts could be used by neo-Nazi groups or those seeking to stoke anti-Semitism and racism in Europe.</p>
      <p>"That's why I felt I had to do it," he said of his purchase.</p>
      <p>The items, still in Munich, are to be eventually delivered to Yad Vashem, where they will be part of a collection of Nazi artefacts crucial to countering Holocaust denial, but not be put on regular display, said Avner Shalev, the institute's director.</p>
      <p>Chatila also met with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and visited Yad Vashem.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Place for optimism'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chatila was born in Beirut into a family of Christian jewellers and moved to Switzerland at the age of two.</p>
      <p>Now among Switzerland's richest 300 people, he supports charities and causes, including many relating to Lebanon and Syrian refugees.</p>
      <p>The auction was brought to Chatila's attention by the European Jewish Association, which has sought to sway public opinion against the trade in Nazi memorabilia.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Mehachem Margolin, head of the association, said Chatila's surprise act had raised attention to such auctions.</p>
      <p>He said it was a powerful statement against racism and xenophobia, especially coming from a non-Jew of Lebanese origin.</p>
      <p>Lebanon and Israel remain technically at war and Lebanese people are banned from communication with Israelis.</p>
      <p>"There is no question that a message that comes from you is 10 times, or 100 times stronger than a message that comes from us," Margolin told Chatila.</p>
      <p>The message was not only about solidarity among people, but also "how one person can make such a huge change," Margolin said.</p>
      <p>"There's a place for optimism."</p>
