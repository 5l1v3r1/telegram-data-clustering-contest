      <p>Angry Afia Schwarzenegger after feeling disrespected by the organizers and Cardi B took to her social media stating that she won’t even wait for Jesus for 4hours how much sitting to wait for the rapper until 8:40 pm.</p>
      <p>She posted: <i>“I will NOT wait 4 hrs for Jesus….I wont do that for @iamcardib, The cheap so called Celebrities are still waiting for their fellow human being till 8:40pm”</i></p>

      <p>She posted: <i>“You’re Not A cheap Celebrity. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Hopefully we will Meet One Day And things Go different. Thank you for coming out anyways. Your country is lovely”</i></p>
