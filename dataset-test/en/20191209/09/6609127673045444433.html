      <p>Showing off her amazing figure she wore the revealing leotard, which she covered with a fur coat and patent thigh high boots.</p>
      <p>Thom, 34, couldn’t keep the grin from his face as he left the venue holding what looked like an overnight bag.</p>
      <p>The pair met when she was judging his band  Try star – featuring Ben Foden and Levis Davis – on X Factor celebrity.</p>
      <p>The Sun first revealed how the pair flirted and texted for weeks before Thom finally asked out Nicole.</p>

      <p>But in a shock move she opted to send the band home during a dramatic sing off.</p>
      <p>At the time sources said she made the decision because she was struggling with people scrutinising and mocking their romance</p>
      <p>An insider said: “Nicole is really into Thom and she didn't want jokes being made about them. She chose to get rid of his group Try Star because it would stop people scrutinising what she has with Tom. And she knew they were the weaker act.”</p>
      <p>However Nicole – who has recently reunited with the Pussycat Dolls, later shrugged the romance off as a big of fling.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Dan Wootton's podcast, she said: “Thom is lovely but what's going on is that I am very busy. It's been a very transitional transformation year for me and I am really focusing on distracting myself with my destiny.</p>
      <p>“Truth be told, I really willed and prayed for this [reunion]. It took a lot of work. The timing was right. It took a lot of focus.”</p>
