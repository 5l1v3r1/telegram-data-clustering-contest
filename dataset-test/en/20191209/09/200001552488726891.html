      <h1>Manager flies into London – Arsenal and Everton pushed forward as possibilities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:39:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/naveen-ullal/" target="_blank">Naveen Ullal</a></address>
      <p>Duncan Ferguson was appointed Everton’s caretaker manager following Marco Silva’s dismissal and helped the Toffees clinch a 3-1 victory over Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>On December 4th, we <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/european-newspaper-claims-manager-aware-evertons-interest-not-yet-negotiated-toffees/">covered claims made by Marca</a> that Everton are interested in Marcelino, and Arsenal have also been repeatedly linked.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard is without a job since he was relieved from his duties at Valencia in September, just months after guiding the club to Copa del Rey success by beating Barcelona in the final.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.superdeporte.es/valencia/2019/12/08/marcelino-aterriza-londres/433919.html">Super Deporte</a> report the 54-year-old travelled to London on Sunday and that’s when Arsenal and Everton are edged forward as potential options.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg hasn’t had the best start to life in charge of the Gunners, and if it doesn’t quickly improve then his interim spell is likely to be a short one.</p>
      <p>Marcelino would prefer to wait until the summer for a new role, although a big offer could change his mind.</p>
