      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/xiaomi">Redmi</a> has been releasing quite a few teasers for the Redmi K30, and the phone has just <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4446607237625744">surfaced</a> in real-life <a href="https://www.indiashopps.com/buddy/xiaomi/redmi-k30-new-hands-on-real-images-and-retail-box-leaked/">images</a>. If you take a look at the gallery down below, you'll be able to see the device.</p>
      <p>Redmi had already confirmed the design of this phone via its teasers. The company showed both the phone's front and back sides in renders. Well, these leaked real-life hands-on images of the Redmi K30 will give you a better idea of what to expect.</p>
      <p>The device shown in the images seems to be Pink, or something of the sort. You can clearly see that it will be made out of metal and glass, and sport quite a few cameras on the back.</p>

      <h3>Redmi K30 real-life images confirm pill-shaped camera cutout, four rear cameras</h3>
      <p>The phone will include four cameras on the back, it seems. Those cameras will be vertically-aligned, and will protrude on the back a bit. A circular design element will be included around those cameras as well, for aesthetic purposes, probably.</p>
      <p>The phone's back side will be curved, as expected. The front side of the phone will be, well, not for everyone. The Redmi K30 will include a rather unseemly pill-shaped camera cutout on the front.</p>
      <p>That camera cutout will sit in the top-right corner of the display, and will be similar to the one on the Galaxy S11+. Some people may prefer those display holes, but they surely do not make phones pretty, especially such large ones.</p>

      <p>That display camera hole will, of course, also take away from the phone's display. It will be inside of your content, unless Redmi ends up offering a way for you to hide it. That is not a perfect solution, and you'll end up with a rather large bezel up top, butâ€¦ it's something, at least.</p>
      <p>The device will include rather thin bezels overall. Its bottom bezel is expected to be a hair thicker than the rest of its bezels.</p>
      <p>In the gallery down below, you can also see the phone's retail box. It looks rather ordinary, a while box with both Xiaomi's and Redmi's brandings on the front. The name of the device is also highlighted here.</p>

      <p>The back side of this retail box contains Redmi's dragon logo. This dragon logo hasn't been around for long, the company only started using it a couple of months ago.</p>
      <h3>The device will become official tomorrow, December 10</h3>
      <p>The Redmi K30 will become official on <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/redmi-k30-confirmed-to-launch-on-december-10-with-5g-support.html">December 10</a>, or tomorrow, if you will. It will include 5G connectivity, and it's possible that we'll see both 4G and 5G variants.</p>
      <p>The Redmi K30 Pro was not mentioned by the company, so we don't know if it's coming or not. If it launches now, it will be fueled by the Snapdragon 855+, probably. If Redmi opts to wait, it may include the Snapdragon 865. The Redmi K30, on the other hand, will ship with one of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 700 series chips.</p>
