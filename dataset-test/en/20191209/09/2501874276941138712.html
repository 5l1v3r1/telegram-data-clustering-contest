      <p>When flames from the Cave Fire in the Santa Ynez Mountains above Santa Barbara erupted on Monday, Nov. 25, evacuation notices, fluctuating power and poor air quality prompted the closing of all three Santa Barbara City College campuses on the days before Thanksgiving. That didn't stop the staff and counselors of SBCC's Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) from serving their students, however.</p>
      <p>For over 20 years, EOPS has given out a turkey and all of the fixings for a traditional Thanksgiving dinner to single parents in the CARE program. The annual Thanksgiving Dinner Giveaway had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday, Nov. 26, at the Main campus on Cliff Drive, but with the campus closed, the dedicated group quickly switched gears.</p>
      <p>Instead of handing out food at the Winslow Maxwell Overlook as they usually did, the EOPS staff showed up at the El Centro S.B. Community Center on the Lower Westside to hand out Vons gift cards, a pumpkin pie and face masks. Despite the last-minute changes, 60 CARE students showed up to pick up their "Thanksgiving dinners," while Student Program Advisor Chelsea Lancaster delivered an additional 18 dinners to students who didn't have transportation.</p>
      <p>Additionally, remembering that the University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) transfer applications were due Saturday, Nov. 30,  EOPS counselors hosted two workshops (one Tuesday and one Wednesday) at a coffee shop on Hollister Avenue to review applications, personal statements and answer any last minute transfer application questions. Over 20 students attended each workshop.</p>
      <p>EOPS is a state-funded, educational support program for financially and academically disadvantaged students enrolled full time at SBCC. The goal of the EOPS program is to provide above and beyond support services to help students meet their educational goals; whether students seek an occupational certificate, Associate in Arts or Science degree or transfer to a four-year university. In 2019, EOPS celebrated 50 years in California (Community Colleges). In 2020, EOPS will be celebrating 50 Years at SBCC. </p>
      <p>SBCC is proud to extend its gratitude to this amazing team of people who always put students first.</p>
