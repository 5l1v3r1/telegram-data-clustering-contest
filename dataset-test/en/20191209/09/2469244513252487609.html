      <p>James Haskell has explained  why he met Caitlyn Jenner on the famous I'm a Celeb bridge when she exited the jungle.</p>
      <p>Viewers were heartbroken that none of Caitlyn's family members came to greet her as she crossed the bridge - the only campmate not to have been hugged by emotional family members upon leaving.</p>
      <p>She confidently strutted down the red-carpeted bridge after legendary presenting duo Ant and Dec announced: "Caitlyn, you're a celebrity, get yourself out of here."</p>
      <p>Viewers declared they were "heartbroken" and branded her iconic family as "disgusting" after they failed to show up to support the star,<a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/james-haskell-explains-lovely-reason-17385309"> reports Wales Online.</a></p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb fans appeared to be disappointed for Caitlyn, that despite having "10 children and 20 grandchildren", she left her adventure on the TV how completely alone.</p>
      <p>James Haskell has revealed he met Caitlyn Jenner on the bridge because he didn't want her to be all alone when she left the jungle.</p>

      <p>The 34-year-old rugby giant went along to the studio to take the place of her absent relatives, and has now explained that he wanted to "repay her kindness" after she befriended him in camp.</p>
      <p>In a post on Instagram, he wrote: "Such an amazing camp mate. I am glad I could repay her for all her kindness and support when I was in the jungle.</p>
      <p>"It was really important to me she had someone there. Its crazy when you come out!"</p>
      <p>Speaking after leaving camp, Caitlyn told Ant and Dec: “I came here to test myself. I did the show 16 years ago, I turned 70 and thought what a challenge.</p>
      <p>"I knew it wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
      <p>"First night I didn’t think I would make it to the next night, but I met some of the greatest people, there wasn't one person causing a problem.</p>
      <p>"I couldn’t believe I made it to three weeks. I am ready to get out.”</p>
