      <h1>Top hotels say guests are stealing mattresses from their rooms</h1>

      <p>You might think it’s ok to take the shampoo or the teabags from your hotel room, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/21/what-are-you-actually-allowed-to-take-from-a-hotel-room-8965185/">when does it go too far?</a></p>
      <p>Some people might say taking slippers is too much but we can all probably agree that lifting the mattress from the hotel bed is absolutely crossing the line.</p>
      <p>Yet apparently it does happen. A study by <a href="https://www.wellness-heaven.de/wellness/study-theft-in-hotels/">Wellness Heaven</a>, a spa and hotel review website, found that 4.2% of the 1,157 hoteliers surveyed have had mattresses go missing.</p>
      <p>Of course, you aren’t going to fit one of those in your suitcase or walk out with it through reception.</p>
      <p>Apparently thieves have managed to take them using goods lifts that lead outside, moving it in the middle of the night to avoid detection.</p>
      <p>The survey found that more popular items to steal include towels, bathrobes, hangers, pens, cutlery, cosmetics and even batteries.</p>
      <p>Over 7% of those surveyed reported that guests have taken the light bulbs out of light fittings and 9.1% said visitors have pocketed the remote control.</p>
      <p>Some of the more unusual things that hotels said went missing included the room number from the guest’s door and a grand piano.</p>
      <p>The Italian hotelier, who owned the instrument, explained: ‘Once I walked through the lobby, I noticed that something was missing, and soon after I learned that three unknown men in overalls had taken away the grand piano, and it never reappeared, of course.’</p>
      <p>Another hotel in Salzburg, Austria said that the wooden benches were stolen from their sauna. It was only when another guest complained about the lack of somewhere to sit and said ‘I can’t relax standing’, that the hotel staff noticed the theft.</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk contacted some top hotels to ask if they’d had any mattresses going missing. Most said they weren’t able to comment.</p>
      <p>Others said it hadn’t been a problem for them – but said that guests do take some smaller items.</p>
      <p>Tim Philips, General Manager at <a href="https://www.theclubjersey.com/">The Club Hotel &amp; Spa in Jersey</a>, said: ‘The most astonishing thing we’ve ever had stolen from the hotel is a TV, and on a smaller scale, we are forever having batteries stolen from remotes.’</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/london">Rosewood Hotel</a> in London said nothing unusual had ever been stolen from them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.guoman.com/">Guoman Hotels</a>, who own The Tower Hotel, The Royal Horseguards Hotel, The Grosvenor Hotel and Great Cumberland Place in London added that they’ve never had a mattress stolen but things like hangers, bathrobes and towels often go missing.</p>
