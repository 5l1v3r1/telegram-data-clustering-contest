      <p>Nickel is mined from many sources around the world and is presently used for stainless steel, nonferrous alloys, electroplating, alloy steel, and foundries. It is a diverse metal that can be manipulated for many purposes and a popular commodity globally. GlobalData’s report outlines the nickel mining market in the Philippines to 2023.</p>
      <h3>New regulations hold promise for the Philippines nickel mining market</h3>
      <p>The Philippines is the second largest producer of nickel worldwide, coming in behind Indonesia. Philippines nickel accounted for 16% global production in 2018. However, since 2016 the Philippines nickel industry has struggled due to the introduction of regulatory measures, leading to a fall in production of 28.5%.

The Philippines nickel market looks to grow 3% to 355kt in 2019, and to 381.4kt by 2023.</p>
