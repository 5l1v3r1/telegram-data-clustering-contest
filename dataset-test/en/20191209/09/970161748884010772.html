      <p>Peter Purves has claimed that he was a victim of ageism after he was axed from commentating Crufts for Channel 4 after 41 years.</p>
      <p>The 80-year-old TV host appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss his sudden dismissal from his role, saying he was ‘stunned’ when he was told he was ‘surplus to requirements’.</p>
      <p>He told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: ‘There hadn’t been a hint about it. This would be my 42nd year at the show. I just feel it’s part of my life, I was very shocked, I was very hurt.’</p>
      <p>‘I did ask for the reasons in writing,’ he revealed. ‘I got them, and there wasn’t a reason.</p>
      <p>‘It was just, “We’re always refreshing the show”. Basically, sorry, one in one out, we’re bringing someone else in, you’re out.’</p>
      <p>Peter, whose legendary time on telly started with kids TV show mainstay Blue Peter, then said that he believed that it was a ‘code for ageism’ and knew Channel 4 wanted to keep age of on-screen talent down.</p>
      <p>‘I know that that was said, I can’t prove it, no one has written it down to me, but I know it,’ he said.  ‘So that has been said. Channel 4 want a younger presentation team, so I had to go.’</p>

      <p>‘The one thing that hurt me quite a lot was, “We want to bring in someone else to sit beside the expert team”,’ Peter said.</p>
      <p>‘So I’m not part of the expert team? 41 years doesn’t make you an expert?’</p>
      <p>‘I don’t believe because you reach a certain age your talent, your skill, whatever it is, whatever I have, it may not be good, but whatever I have should not just be dismissed for my age,’ he added.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been part of that show for a long, long time so that’s what’s very hard to break the feeling of.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a void. I hope it doesn’t affect other work, it may, but I hope it doesn’t.’</p>

      <p>When approached by Metro.co.uk, a spokesperson for Kennel Club, who runs Crufts, said: “Channel 4 takes its own independent editorial decisions for its programmes.</p>
      <p>‘Peter is and will remain a great friend of the Kennel Club and Crufts, and we are delighted that he will be presenting the 2020 Best in Show trophy.’</p>

        <i>Metro.co.uk has also contacted Channel 4 for comment.</i>

      <p>On talking to Peter, Piers took particular exception to the star’s plight, and vowed to launch a campaign to get his role back.</p>
      <p>‘I’d love to know what Clare Balding thinks about this. I know Clare, and she won’t be happy about this,’ Piers declared.</p>
      <p>‘It’s just ageist, that’s all it is. It’s people saying we can’t have a bloke that age doing this.</p>
      <p>‘Why? It’s only 41 years! 41 years.’</p>
      <p>‘You were a legend of my generation,’ he continued. ‘We’re going to try and fight the good fight, Peter.</p>
      <p>‘We’re sorry you’ve been given this horrible shock before Christmas.’</p>
