      <h1>Mystery Surrounds Sudden Death Of Kijana Wamalwa’s Son As Family Rubbishes Drug Abuse Claims</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:35:26+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Wycliffe</a></address>
      <p>The late vice president Kijana Wamalwa’s son, William Makali, is dead.</p>
      <p>Robert Wamalwa, the deceased’s uncle, confirmed the reports saying Makali died on Sunday evening at their Milimani home in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County.</p>
      <p>Robert told the media that the cause of Makali’s death was not clear as they had interacted a day before his death saying he “looked fine”.</p>
      <p>He, however, noted that the deceased was diabetic and the family is waiting for a postmortem report to confirm Makali’s cause of death.</p>
      <p>“My nephew was diabetic and probably that might have led to his death but, of course, [when] the official autopsy report [is out] we will be able to know what happened,” Wamalwa intimated to Nation.</p>
      <p>The family further dismissed claims that Makali, a third born in his family, died as a result of depression, alcoholism and drug abuse.</p>
      <p>“It is far from the truth. It really very unfair and people should not capitalise on something like that. They should have a sense of decorum and respect to the family and the dead,” said Wamalwa.</p>
      <p>Makali, who was in his mid-20s, was a second-year student at the University of Nairobi pursuing commerce.</p>
