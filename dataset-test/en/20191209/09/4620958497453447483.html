      <p>If you’re tired of gifting the same items every year, chances are you probably need to change your shopping habits. That’s probably for the best, particularly if you seem to find yourself in shopping malls over the holiday season…</p>
      <p>While your intentions are surely good, mass-produced products rarely capture that awesome feeling you get when you know you’ve found the PERFECT gift for someone close to you. Maybe it’s part of an inside joke or something they mentioned in passing… Whatever the case, it’s probably not found on a department store shelf.</p>
      <p>Shopping at thrift shops over the holidays, however, is an economical way to find one-of-a-kind treasures for your family and friends. It’s also a fun way to flex your creative muscles during the holiday season and is particularly enjoyable when you have an extra $500 to cover your expenses!</p>

      <p>MCC Thrift shops pride themselves on helping to reduce the waste that goes into Canadian landfills each year. By thrifting this holiday season, you’re able to find preloved items a new home to be reused before they need to be recycled. This helps keep stockings full and landfills empty — in fact, MCC’s rePurpose centre diverted 1.3 million pounds of waste from landfills in Ontario alone from March 2018 to March 2019.</p>
      <p>This is an especially incredible feat when you consider the environmental impact of big-box retail and fast fashion. According to the Environmental Protection Agency 15.1 million tons of textile clothing waste was produced in 2013. In some countries, those numbers are getting worse.</p>

The shop tries to repair as many donated items as possible, but when items are not repairable for their original purpose, volunteers find ways to repurpose items as unique art or home decor pieces.

      <p>Not only does shopping at MCC Thrift shops help combat the environmental impact of the retail industry, but it also gives back to those in need. Proceeds from every MCC Thrift shop purchase go to relief, development and peace projects overseas and here in Canada. <br/><br/>If you’re looking to find unique gifts that truly capture the spirit of goodwill and holiday cheer, consider visiting an MCC Thrift shop this holiday season. </p>
