      <h1>Marcus Rashford and his agent ask Premier League to count goal vs Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>Marcus Rashford's goal vs Aston Villa earlier this month was given as a Tom Heaton own goal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:11:35+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Bray, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/joe-bray/</a></address>
      <p>Marcus Rashford and his agent have asked the Premier League why his 'goal' vs Aston Villa earlier this month has been taken off him.</p>
      <p>Rashford is enjoying a fine season for United, with his goal against Manchester City his 13th of the season in 21 appearances. It's already equalled his best ever return for the club in a single season.</p>
      <p>However, the striker clearly feels he should have one more strike in that tally, and appears to be taking his case to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>In the home draw  over Aston Villa on December 1, Rashford's header hit the post before bouncing in off visiting goalkeeper Tom Heaton. Rashford ran off in celebration, but the goal was later given as an own goal, with Rashford getting the assist.</p>
      <p>After his derby goal this weekend, the Premier League tweeted: "With 13 goals in 21 apps in all comps, @MarcusRashford has equalled his best goalscoring return for @ManUtd in a single season."</p>
      <p>But Rashford, still unhappy at the Villa decision, corrected it by replying with the number 14. He added a picture of the header against Villa, saying: "We gotta talk about this."</p>
      <p>Backing up the striker was his brother and agent Dwaine Maynard, who then Tweeted: "100% a goal should be credited to the forward! Without contact it doesn’t go towards the goal! Goals have been given for less @ManUtd @premierleague @FA ???"</p>
      <p>Maynard followed up his plea to the authorities on Instagram as he appealed for fans to contact the Premier League to get the goal awarded in Rashford's favour.</p>

      <p>"If you want a say in this, head over to Twitter and tag the @premierleague with ur opinion," he said.</p>
      <p>"You get hammered when you don't score! So now let's hammer them because you have and it hasn't been credited ... #whatsminesismines"</p>
