      <h1>Just weeks until WhatsApp will stop working on these phone models</h1>
      <h2>If your model is on the list, which includes iPhone, Android and Nokia devices, you're being urged to change phones if you'd like to keep WhatsApp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:58:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw, Andrew McQuarrie, Trinity Shaw</a></address>
      <p>Owners of older mobile phones have been warned their handsets will no longer be able to operate WhatsApp in a matter of weeks.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the company behind the popular messaging platform announced the app would not work on many phones as early as December 31. </p>
      <p>The move will be completed by February 1,<a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/weeks-left-before-whatsapp-ban-17385638"> reports Wales Online</a>, meaning people with Windows models and old iPhones will be frozen out.</p>
      <p>A WhatsApp spokesman said: “As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The full list of phones affected and the date they will (or did) stop supporting WhatsApp</b>
      </p>
      <p>• Nokia Symbian S60 after June 30, 2017</p>
      <p>• BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 after December 31, 2017</p>
      <p>• Nokia S40 after December 31, 2018</p>
      <p>• All Windows Phone operating systems after December 31, 2019</p>
      <p>• Android versions 2.3.7 and older after February 1, 2020</p>
      <p>• iPhone iOS 7 and older after February 1, 2020</p>
      <p>A WhatsApp spokesman said: “While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don't offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.</p>
      <p>"This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.”</p>
      <p>“If you use one of these affected mobile devices, we recommend upgrading to a newer Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone to continue using WhatsApp.”</p>
      <p>Phones affected by the changes include iPhones with versions of iOS older than 7, as well as Android devices running on version 2.3.7.</p>
