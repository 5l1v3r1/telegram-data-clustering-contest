      <p>An elderly father took his daughter for a pint just minutes after they escaped jail over a vicious pub brawl.</p>
      <p>Robert Stott, 66, and Anne-Marie, 33, had their celebratory drink in a bar near a courthouse after they apologised to a judge for threatening a publican who had barred them.</p>
      <p>The pair had been arrested in June last year after going berserk when told to leave the Queens Arms in Bredbury, Stockport, over an earlier incident.</p>

      <p>Stott snr grabbed a glass and his daughter took hold of a bottle before terrorising landlord John Howe and his wife as well as other drinkers.</p>
      <p>Care worker Anne-Marie, from Bredbury, shouted: 'You f***ing b***h, I'm going to knock you out, I'm going to kill you, your pub's going to get it.'</p>
      <p>Both were quickly wrestled to the ground, with the glass broken in the process.</p>
      <p>But Anne-Marie kept hold of the broken bottle and continued to threaten punters outside. Nobody was injured during the attack.</p>
      <p>At Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, the father and daughter both admitted affray and having possession of an offensive weapon. </p>

      <p>Both were given 12 community orders and were ordered to complete 20 days of rehabilitation activity requirements.</p>
      <p>After the hearing, they were spotted sinking pints of lager in a pub close to the court.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred during the day on June 25, 2018, when the Stotts were having a drink in the Queens Arms.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Kate Hammond said: 'They had been previously barred from that public house and the incident in the public house occurred when the landlady told Mr Howe something was happening, they checked the CCTV and she recognised Anne-Marie Stott as someone who was barred from the premises.</p>
      <p>'Mr Howe asked Stott and her father to leave but they effectively objected to that and both picked up weapons, she had a bottle and he had a glass. Both threatened the landlord and other members of the pub who were aware of these items.</p>

      <p>'She seemed to swing a bottle at one of these people but missed them. He attempted to hit somebody with the glass but was wrestled to the floor and the glass was smashed.</p>
      <p>'She was pushed to the floor and the bottle smashed, but she kept hold of the smashed end and threatened others with it. Whilst that was taking place, she made various threats to the landlady such as: 'You f***ing b***h, going to knock you out, going to kill you, your pub's going to get it'. This all frightened the landlady.'</p>
      <p>In a victim personal statement, John Howe said: 'The incident made me feel nervous, I feel like I have to be more vigilant as she could return. My family live here and I have to safeguard them against this sort of behaviour.'</p>

      <p>He has since left the pub.</p>
      <p>In her statement, the unnamed landlady said: 'I felt angry and worried for the customers that they were going to be hurt, in particular John. </p>
      <p>'I'm worried about the future as I live across the road and she was threatening to come back.</p>
      <p>'In her words she said the pub was 'going to get it'. I am worried we are going to be attacked or she will attack other customers.'</p>
      <p>The court heard Stott snr, of Woodley, Stockport, had 28 previous offences on his record.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer Neil Fryman said: 'Both defendants know this was disgraceful behaviour - both were heavily intoxicated.</p>
      <p>'This was a 66-year-old father with his 33-year-old daughter, in the street, in broad daylight, both with glass implements. In any view there was a risk of injury and potential serious injury at that.</p>
      <p>'It is seen on the CCTV that a man wrestled him to the floor and the glass was all over the floor. Perhaps it was by chance that nobody was injured. She appreciates that whilst she hadn't broken the glass deliberately, it got broken in the fracas and she still held on to a broken bit, which could have caused injury to anyone.</p>
      <p>'They regret what happened. There was a guilty plea at the earliest opportunity. You would think Mr Stott is getting far too old to be getting into fracas in the street, drunk, with potential serious consequences, but there you are. He says he is sorry. He has a stepson who has severe autism. He has been married for 34 years.</p>
      <p>'Miss Stott is working as a carer, and is in the potential position of trust and authority, at a care home in Stockport. The defendants know people could have been injured.'</p>

        <figcaption>Both were handed an exclusion order, banning them from entering the Queen Arms in Bredbury for the next 12 months. Pictured: The Piccadilly Tavern where they went after the hearing in Manchester</figcaption>

      <p>Sentencing Judge Maurice Greene said: 'You were asked to leave and as you were being asked to leave you objected, you put down your drink and you picked up a bottle and swung it around making threats.</p>
      <p>'You, Robert Stott, saw this happening or maybe not and maybe you didn't know what was going on, but perhaps you tried to protect your daughter and became involved because you had too much to drink and you picked up a glass.</p>
      <p>'Both of you ended up on the ground. Your bottle smashed and you held onto the smashed bit, again threatening people with it. It was more by luck then judgement that nobody was injured. If somebody was injured, neither of you would be walking out of this court room today.</p>
      <p>'This caused serious alarm and distress and there was a risk for disorder.. Neither of you are the sort of people who would get involved in violence but this is aggravated by the fact this was in a public place, other people were involved and there were two of you.'</p>
      <p>Both were handed an exclusion order, banning them from entering the Queen Arms in Bredbury for the next 12 months.</p>
