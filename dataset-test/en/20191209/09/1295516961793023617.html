      <h1>Amazing Spider-Man 2 Concept Art Reveals Early Version of Peter's Suit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:12:57+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Dominguez</a></address>
      <p>There's often quite a bit of work that goes into crafting an on-screen version of a superhero's costume. And the iconic Spidey suit worn by Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker in 2014's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-amazing-spider-man-2/">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a> is certainly no exception.</p>
      <p>Though the second film in director Marc Webb's <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> duology is nearing its sixth birthday, Ironhead Studio -- which has long worked on Spidey's live-action films (including the new <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>) -- recently shared new concept art depicting an early version of Garfield's second Spider suit to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5qwbjsFcVC/">Instagram</a>.</p>

      <p>"In 2013 we built the Spider-Man suit for <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i>," the studio wrote. "Our job was the help Costume Designer Deb Scott realize her vision of the 'iconic' Spider-Man. Before building the full version we sculpted this 26" concept maquette, which helped set up the road map for the final suit."</p>

      <p>The suit work by Garfield's Spider-Man in 2012's <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> was significantly different from any version of the costume seen prior -- likely so the reboot could differentiate itself from the Tobey Maguire-starred trilogy of <i>Spider-Man</i> films from director Sam Raimi. For <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i>, however, Webb and company opted for a much more comics-accurate look. In fact, while Garfield's second suit does have a lot in common with Maguire's, it's the finer details -- such as the color of the web design and the shape of the mask's lenses -- that make it arguably the most faithful on-screen version of Spidey's costume to date.</p>
      <p>The post from Ironhead offers a glimpse at what <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i>'s suit looked like before being physically crafted. While it is largely the same, there are a few minor differences -- such as the fact that the original concept art features much deeper shades of red and blue than the suit seen in the final film. The concept art version also appears to reflect light much more prominently than the finished suit. At any rate, it's certainly interesting to see just how much detail goes into crafting a superhero's suit before anyone so much as picks up a piece of cloth.</p>
