      <h1>Man Utd must change manager despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer revival, says Simon Jordan</h1>
      <h2>The Norwegian manager has led United to victories over Tottenham and Manchester City in the last week but some are still not convinced he is the best man for the job</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:21:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan still does not believe Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the man to take <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> forward despite their impressive recent form.</p>
      <p>United beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and bitter rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> last week with two superb displays, and support appears to be growing for Solskjaer after rumours he could have been nearing the sack.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, United have still struggled in games against teams outside the top six this season, and have dropped points against the likes of Aston Villa, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> already.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1203769060279889922">talkSPORT</a> Jordan said he still felt United should be looking at changing managers if they wish to compete at the highest level.</p>

      <p>"People are jumping on the bandwagon of all of a sudden United are doing well because they've beaten Tottenham and Man City," Jordan said.</p>
      <p>"I remain unconvinced. I think form is temporary, class is permanent and I don't think Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has the class to be Man United manager.</p>
      <p>"I think he's getting more backbone and I think he's getting more rhetoric that is becoming of a Manchester United manager. He's developing more confidence and is clearly being backed by the board.</p>
      <p>"I get the feeling there's an element of being galvanized in that they know they get a lot of criticism, they know Solskjaer is getting a lot of observations made about him and the players are obviously responding to him."</p>

      <p>Solskjaer's future may depend on how United perform over the Christmas period, with the Red Devils facing a kind-looking run of fixtures in the Premier League against the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> , Newcastle and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> .</p>
      <p>They have also already qualified for the knockout stages of the Europa League and have a golden chance to reach the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup when they take on League Two side Colchester on December 18.</p>
