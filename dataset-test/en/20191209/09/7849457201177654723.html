      <h1>Retired cop killed in QC buy-bust</h1>

      <p>Anti-scalawag operatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP) killed early Monday morning a recently retired policeman in a buy-bust operation in Quezon City.</p>
      <p>Col. Ronald Lee, director of the Integrity Monitoring and Enforcement Group (IMEG), said the operation stemmed from intelligence reports about rampant drug-dealing in Rizal and nearby areas involving retired Corporal Tirso Lactaotao.</p>
      <p>“Intelligence build-up revealed that suspect had been long involved in illegal drug pushing operating in Rizal province and nearby province,” said Lee.</p>
      <p>At around 12:30 a.m. on Monday, a buy-bust was implemented after IMEG operatives were able to convince him to sell shabu in Barangay Bagumbayan.</p>
      <p>But during the operation, Lee said that the 48-year old cop sensed that he was dealing with policemen.</p>
      <p>“The operation resulted in an armed encounter when the subject upon sensing that he is dealing with a PNP poseur buyer,  suddenly drew out his gun and fired at the operatives, prompting them to defend themselves and fire back, hitting the suspect on the different parts of his body,” said Lee.</p>
      <p>Lactaotao was taken to the Nova District Hospital but was declared dead.</p>
      <p>A resident of Barangay Bagumbayan in Pililia town of Rizal, Lactaotao availed of early retirement last month.</p>
      <p>Seized from him were a 9mm pistol, several identification cards that include those from the PNP and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, two pieces P2,000 buy-bust money, two cellular phones, and seven sachets of shabu.</p>
