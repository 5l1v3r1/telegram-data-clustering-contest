      <p>Video and television evidence appeared to show a fan making a monkey gesture at the Brazilian midfielder during United's 2-1 away win at rivals City on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The man has reportedly since been arrested by Greater Manchester Police on suspicion of racially aggravated public order after City released a statement just as the derby ended to say they were working with authorities to find the suspected guilty parties.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, a discouraged Fred, who was also hit with one of the many objects thrown at him in the second half, said he did not want to give the troublemakers any more attention.</p>

      <p>"We are still in a backward society," he told <i>ESPN Brazil.</i> Â </p>
      <p>"On the field, I didn't see anything. I saw it only in the locker room afterwards.</p>
      <p>"The guys showed me. He even threw a lighter and it hit me. I try not to care about that. I try to look ahead.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, this is happening in some stadiums. It happened here, it happened in Ukraine with some friends. It's sad, but we have to keep our heads up and forget about that.</p>
      <p>"We can't give them any attention because that's all they want. I spoke to the referee after the match, they will do something about it and that's all.</p>
      <p>"We are all the same regardless of skin colour, hair and gender. We came from the same place and we all go to the same place when it's all said and done.</p>
      <p>"Thank God, I have a lot of friends here in the locker room who hugged me, like (Jesse) Lingard.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to think about it. I just want to move on."</p>
