      <h1>Experts to use AI to finish Beethoven's unfinished 10th symphony</h1>

      <p>An international team of musicologists, the pianist Robert Levin and computer experts are to use Beethoven's fragmentary notes for his unfinished 10th symphony to complete the work using artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>The new symphony is to have its premiere in Bonn on April 28, Deutsche Telekom, the company that initiated the project, confirmed to dpa.</p>
      <p>The Bonn-based Beethoven Orchestra plans to perform the work to mark 250 years since Beethoven was born in the city.</p>
      <p>The team does not have a lot to go on. Beethoven left only sketchy notes for the work, but according to a report in the Sunday edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, the team aims to train an algorithm to complete the missing sections in Beethoven's style.</p>
      <p>They are unable at this stage to say what might emerge. "The algorithm is unpredictable and surprises us anew every day," project coordinator Matthias Roeder, the director of the Salzburg-based Karajan Institute, told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>"It's like a small child exploring Beethoven's world," Roeder added.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most famous unfinished work, Schubert's 10th symphony in D major underwent "completion" by a computer financed by China's Huawei and premiered in London in February.</p>
