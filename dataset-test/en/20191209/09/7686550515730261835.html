      <h1>Shoppers blast M&amp;S for 'mugging' them over Percy Pig Advent calendars</h1>
      <h2>The high street giant is renowned for selling Percy Pigs - but the Advent calendar has sparked controversy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:36:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Pugh, Amardeep Bassey</a></address>
      <p>Marks &amp; Spencer shoppers have been complaining about what's inside the store's new Percy Pig Advent calendar.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, dozens of parents have slammed the calendar, as it doesn't contain a Percy Pig sweet behind each door (despite quite clearly stating on the front that it's got chocolate inside).</p>
      <p>Even more annoying is the fact that the chocolates themselves aren't actually shaped like Percy - or anything to do with him, for that matter.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, people aren't happy, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/percy-pig-advent-calendars-slammed-17373293">MEN</a> .</p>

      <p>"First day of winter and my children are disappointed that the Percy Pig advent calendar from <a href="https://twitter.com/marksandspencer">@marksandspencer</a> doesn’t contain pig shaped chocolate. Nothing 'Percy' about it at all," moaned one parent on social media.</p>
      <p>"Disappointed ... Had a Percy pig advent calendar bought for me. Was thrilled. Didn't read the outside totally gutted to find chocolate behind the doors.... Am I the only one who was expecting a proper Percy sweet?" wrote another.</p>
      <p>"Heard on the radio earlier about the marks and Spencer’s Percy Pig advent calendar..... Apparently the treat is a chocolate pig.... Why is it not an ACTUAL Percy Pig <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Disapponting?src=hashtag_click">#Disapponting</a> ," slammed somebody else.</p>
      <p>"FURIOUS!! I bought this Percy Pig advent calendar for a dear friend who doesn't like chocolate!! DOESN'T LIKE CHOCOLATE! Why would you put chocolate in a Percy Pig product! She's very embarrassed by not eating it and I'm furious," said a <i>FURIOUS</i> shopper.</p>

      <p>"But at the same time, why make a ‘Percy Pig’ advent calendar then not actually put Percy Pig’s in it? Whyyyyy?!!" exclaimed another disgruntled shopper.</p>
      <p>Percy does, however, have some support, as one person tweeted: "It's the people who have bought [the calendar] and properly kicked off about it, when it clearly says they're chocolate on the front that made me laugh," said one amused shopper.</p>
      <p>"It clearly states on the advent calendar '24 festive milk chocolate shapes and a bag of percy pigs for Christmas day'."</p>
      <p>"Why are you furious at Marks &amp; Spencer for something you've not read that is as clear as day on the product itself?" questioned somebody else.</p>
      <p>No one can agree. It's like Brexit all over again.</p>
