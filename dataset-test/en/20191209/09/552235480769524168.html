      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> have urged people not to approach a missing man from the Highlands who is considered a risk to the public.</p>
      <p>Derek Mackay was reported missing by police on Monday after he failed to comply with the conditions of a court order.</p>
      <p>Officers say they are carrying out ‘extensive efforts’ to locate the 32-year-old from Invergordon.</p>
      <p>He has been described as 5ft 8in, of medium build, fair complexion, with short brown hair.</p>
      <p>A post on Highlands and Islands Police Division Facebook page read: "We are appealing for information from the public to locate a man from the Ross-shire area, who is considered to be a risk to the public.</p>
      <p>"Derek Ray Mackay, (33), of Invergordon, has failed to comply with conditions of a court order. <br/><br/>"He is described as 5 ft 8 in height, medium build, fair complexion, with short brown hair."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> Detective Inspector Craig Still, said: “We want to trace Derek Mackay as quickly as possible and I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has information.</p>
      <p>"I would like to reassure people that considerable and extensive efforts are being put into locating him and I would ask people not approach Mr Mackay if you believe you have seen him. Instead please call Police Scotland on 101 as soon as you can."</p>
      <p>It is a second time in around a year that police have launched an appeal for information on his whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Mackay was "unlawfully at large" after he failed to attend a court hearing in September 2018.</p>
