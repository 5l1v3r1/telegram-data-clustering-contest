      <p>Oil prices fell on Monday after data showing China's overall exports of goods and services shrank for a fourth straight month, sending shivers through a market already concerned about damage being down to global demand by the Sino-U.S. trade war.</p>
      <p>TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Monday after data showing China's overall exports of goods and services shrank for a fourth straight month, sending shivers through a market already concerned about damage being down to global demand by the Sino-U.S. trade war.</p>
      <p>Brent futures were down 33 cents, or 0.5per cent, at US$64.06 per barrel by 0055 GMT, after gaining about 3per cent last week, boosted by news that OPEC and allies would deepen output cuts.</p>

      <p>West Texas Intermediate oil futures were down 37 cents, or 0.6per cent to US$58.85 a barrel, having risen about 7per cent last week on prospects for lower production from 'OPEC+', the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and associated producers including Russia.</p>
      <p>Monday's sudden chill came after customs data released on Sunday showed exports from the world's second-biggest economy in November fell 1.1per cent from a year earlier - a sharp reversal from expectations for a 1per cent increase in a Reuters poll of analysts.</p>
      <p>The weak start to the week came despite data showing China's crude imports jumped a record, revealing just how deep jitters are embedded in the market over the trade U.S.-China trade row that has stymied global growth and oil demand.</p>
      <p>The sagging export data is "a casualty again of the protracted trade war," said Stephen Innes chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader.  </p>
      <p>Washington and Beijing have been trying to agree a trade deal that will end tit-for-tat tariffs, but talks have dragged on for months as they wrangle over key details.</p>
      <p>Monday's price drops put an end to a strong run in previous sessions fueled by hopes for the OPEC+ production curb deal.</p>
      <p>On Friday, those producers agreed to deepen their output cuts from 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.7 million bpd, representing about 1.7per cent of global production.</p>
      <p>Still, U.S. production has surged since the OPEC+ cuts were first introduced in 2017 in an attempt to drain a supply glut that had long weighed on prices. Output there has risen even as the drill count has fallen, reflecting more efficient well extraction.</p>
      <p>Energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely watched weekly drilling report on Friday that the U.S. drill count fell in the week to Dec. 6 - a seventh week of decline.</p>
      <p>Drilling companies cut five oil rigs, leaving a total of 661, the lowest since April 2017.</p>
