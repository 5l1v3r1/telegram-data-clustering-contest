      <h3>RAGAY, C. SUR- members of the local police are tracking down suspects who were responsible for stoning buses plying the route from Metro Manila to Bicol passing the Andaya Highway in this town.</h3>
      <p>Police Major Ruben Perico, Ragay, MPS head said, that after the typhoon when most of Andaya Highway is unlighted the stoning incidents have reportedly intensified.</p>
      <p>Perico reported that police personnel in a patrol car recently chased two suspects in motorcycle all the way to the neighboring town of Del Gallego, a boundary town of C. Sur.</p>
      <p>While the police chase reportedly resulted to the recovery of the suspectsâ€™ motorcycle, Perico said they are tracking down the owner of the motorcycle used in the stoning.</p>
      <p>Already crews of five passenger buses plying the Manila-to-Bicol route and vise-versa have filed official complaints to the Ragay MPS, that glass windows and front windshields of the vehicles have been shattered or broken.</p>
      <p>Most of the bus crew reported to the police that there were minors among the suspects accompanied by adults, who were stoning buses while passing the Andaya Highway.</p>
