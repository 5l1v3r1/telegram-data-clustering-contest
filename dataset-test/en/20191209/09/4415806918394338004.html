      <p>Dan Osborne has congratulated his wife Jacqueline Jossa after she won the 2019 series of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actress triumphed over Coronation Street’s Andy Whyment and radio DJ Roman Kemp to be named queen of the jungle.</p>
      <p>Osborne wrote on Instagram: “My jungle Queen!! Words can not describe how proud I am of this woman!</p>

      <p>“She absolutely smashed it from day 1 and deserves this sooo much!! Well done baby.”</p>
      <p>The former The Only Way Is Essex star flew out to Australia to greet his wife as she left the jungle as their marriage was the subject of tabloid headlines.</p>
      <p>While she was in the jungle, her campmate and Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson reportedly told her that Osborne cheated on her with Stephenson’s ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>Osborne and Allen were previously in the Celebrity Big Brother house together.</p>
      <p>However, Osborne and Jossa embraced and posed for photographs together after she crossed the bridge to leave the show.</p>

      <p>Stephenson wrote on his Instagram story that Jossa deserved to win from day one, adding: “So proud of my lil sister.”</p>
      <p>Their fellow campmate Caitlyn Jenner also celebrated with her, writing: “Congratulations to my sweet friend @jacjossa witnessing your growth on this show was amazing! Congrats Jungle Jack!”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, fellow camper Kate Garraway wrote: “She did it!!! All hail the jungle queen – love ya @jacjossa… now go cuddle your babies!”</p>
      <p>Just before she won, she told hosts Ant &amp; Dec: “It was not what I expected.</p>

      <p>“It was a lot harder. I didn’t think it would be such a turning point in life, I went in as one person, I feel like I have come out as a different person.</p>
      <p>“I’ve grown in confidence and found who I am as a person.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I think it’s so easy to care so much what other people think of you, trolls, people who say nasty things for the sake of it and I try to change their opinion.</p>
      <p>“Here you have no choice, you have to be you. Here I have different people bigging me up of different ages, I can’t really work out what is happening.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been known as Lauren from EastEnders, or a doormat, or whatever you want to call it, and coming here I have actually proved myself.”</p>
      <p>After the show Declan Donnelly wrote on Ant &amp; Dec’s Twitter account: “Thanks for your company on here tonight and all series of this years #ImACeleb. It’s been a blast.</p>
