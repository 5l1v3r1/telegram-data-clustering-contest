      <p>Curro Swimming Academy (CSA) dominated the pool, adding “Best Club 2019” to their tally at the Mpumalanga Swimming Championship hosted at Van Riebeeck Park in Mbombela this past weekend.</p>
      <p>With several fast times in various categories, CSA’s 12-year-old Eben Terblanche was the golden boy of the<br/>tournament. He not only scooped the best junior male title, but also won the junior victor ludorum trophy.</p>

      <p>In his 200-metre breaststroke class, he sailed through the water to end fourth overall against three older boys, but managed to beat his other, much older rivals to the podium.</p>
      <p>The academy also gained the Best Master Swimmer trophy via veteran swimmer Michele Esterhuizen. She swam a<br/>very convincing 100-metre butterfly to beat her nearest rival by about two seconds.</p>

      <p>She upped her game in the 50-metre backstroke to beat her nearest rival by almost a full two minutes. This set the<br/>tone for her tournament as she maintained this fire throughout the weekend.</p>
      <p>Jetro Piso of Uniswim walked away with the top senior spots. Not only did he fight his way to best senior male, but was also awarded the senior victor ludorum trophy after he was basically unbeatable in the water.</p>

      <p>He convincingly beat Jakobus Terblanche in the men’s 17-23 50-metre backstroke, and also left his rivals in his wake in the 100-metre butterfly event. He smashed the record for this event in a new time of 57:83.</p>
      <p>Teammate Brooklyn Croxon equaled Piso’s achievements in the female category by winning both the best senior female as well as the senior victrix ludorum trophies. Croxon did not have the best run in the 50-metre backstroke event as Magdaleen Terblanche of Guppie Tigers gave her a run for her money.</p>

      <p>Croxon had to be content with a silver as Terblanche stormed ahead to set a new record for that event, a time of 32:33. Croxon, however, made a comeback to set a new record in her 200-metres breaststroke with a time of 2:42:37.</p>
