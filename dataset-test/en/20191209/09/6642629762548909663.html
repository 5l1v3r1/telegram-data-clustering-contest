      <h2>Electorate is deeply divided as UK braces for snap poll called to break political deadlock over Brexit.</h2>

      <p>Britons will head to the polls on Thursday, December 12 for a snap <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/191128113823027.html">general election</a>, which is hoped to end the country's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> impasse.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a>'s Conservative Party and Jeremy Corbyn's main opposition Labour Party present widely different proposals for solving the political crisis, which continues to rumble on after 52 percent voted to leave the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> in a June 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>Here is what you need to know:</p>
      <h3>What's happening?</h3>
      <p>Voters in 650 constituencies across the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> will elect a minister of parliament to the lower chamber House of Commons via the first-past-the-post system. </p>
      <p>To win a seat, candidates need more votes than any of their competitors.</p>
      <p>A party needs to win 326 seats in order to secure a majority in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>Parliament's upper chamber, the House of Lords, is unelected, and rather nominated by some main parties.</p>
      <p>If no party achieves a majority, there will be a hung parliament. The party with the largest vote share may form a minority government, seek out support from smaller parties for a "confidence and supply" arrangement, or try to build a formal coalition.</p>

      <p>Brexit is the main issue for voters, but a slowing <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/business.html?page=6">economy</a>, creaking <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/health.html">health</a> and social care provision, the unfolding <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/climate-sos.html">climate crisis</a>, and law and order are among other key concerns.</p>
      <p>On polling day, voting opens at 7:00 GMT and ends at 22:00 GMT. Final results are expected to be declared in the early hours of Friday, December 13.</p>
      <h3>Who is expected to win?</h3>
      <p>A disclaimer to begin: Polling agencies have been wrong before - remember the EU referendum?</p>
      <p>But that said, the Conservative Party appears set to win most votes and possibly a majority of seats.</p>
      <p>The party is tracking 10<a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/08/political-trackers-5-6-dec-update"> percentage points</a> ahead of its nearest rival, left-wing Labour.</p>
      <p>Forty-three percent of voters say they would vote Conservative if an election were held tomorrow, according to a recent YouGov poll.</p>
      <p>That could translate into the Conservatives winning 359 seats in the Commons, <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/uk-general-election-2019/">according</a> to YouGov, compared with 211 for Labour.</p>

      <p>Among the smaller parties, the pro-European, centrist Liberal Democrats are predicted to win 14 percent and 13 seats in Parliament. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which only fields candidates for the 59 constituencies in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/scotland.html">Scotland</a>, is projected to win 43 seats, but only 3 percent of all votes cast.</p>
      <h3>Where might the vote leave Brexit?</h3>
      <p>Johnson has promised to "get Brexit done" and pass his withdrawal agreement through Parliament by the end of January if the Conservatives scoop a majority.</p>
      <p>However, even if Parliament passes the existing withdrawal agreement by that deadline, a potentially gruelling negotiation over the UK and the EU's future relationship will begin as the transition period comes into effect.</p>
      <p>If Labour wins, it will ask the EU for another Brexit extension to allow time to renegotiate the current withdrawal agreement. Corbyn wants a softer divorce deal based on a new UK-EU customs union and closer EU single market alignment.</p>
      <p>Labour's reworked agreement would be put to a legally-binding second referendum within six months, alongside an option to remain in the EU.</p>
