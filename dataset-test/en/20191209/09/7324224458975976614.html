      <h1>Villa Park in salute to legend Ron Saunders</h1>
      <h2>Villa fans paid tribute to legendary manager Ron Saunders during yesterday’s Premier League clash with Leicester.</h2>

      <p>Saunders passed away on Saturday, aged 87.</p>
      <p>Players from both sides wore black armbands while there was applause prior to kick off and in the 81st minute to mark Saunders’ 1980/81 league title triumph.</p>
      <p>One of the Villa’s greatest managers, Saunders joined the club in June 1974, helping them clinch promotion from Division Two in his first season in charge.</p>
      <p>Villa also won the League Cup in 1975 and 1977, but the biggest prize of all arrived four years later when they were crowned champions of England.</p>
      <p>In early February 1982, Saunders sensationally quit, apparently over a contract dispute, with Villa in the quarter-finals of the European Cup, which they went on to win under assistant Tony Barton.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, nine days after he walked out on Villa, he joined cross-city rivals Birmingham City before quitting in 1986. He then took charge of Albion, and remains the only man to manage all three clubs.</p>
