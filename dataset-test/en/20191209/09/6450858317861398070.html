      <p>Here are the best GHD deals right now. Prices are updated daily.</p>
      <h3>Best GHD Original IV Styler Deals</h3>
      <p>The classic GHD straightening iron and suitable for all hair types, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fghd-iv-styler-collection%2Fghd-iv-styler">Original IV</a> is the most commonly discounted GHD product. These can reach a temperature of 185ºC, and feature 1in ceramic plates for fast styling. In common with all GHD styling products there is universal voltage, auto shut-off, a 2.7m cable and a two-year warranty. Note that you do not get the heat-resistant plate guard and wishbone hinge found further up the range. The retail price is £109.</p>

      <h3>Best GHD Gold Styler Deals</h3>
      <p>Much like the Original IV, thanks to its 1in ceramic plates that can heat up to 185ºC, the more recent <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fgold-series%2Fghd-gold-styler">Gold</a> stylers add dual-zone technology. By offering two heated zones rather than one, they can offer more consistent and faster styling. These irons are also suitable for all hair types, but arguably the best choice for frequent styling. The Gold model also looks a bit fancier and comes with a plastic plate guard for easier storage after use.</p>
      <p>The retail price is £149. Read our full <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/health-beauty/ghd-gold-professional-styler-review-3684343/">GHD Gold review</a>.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <h3>Best GHD Platinum+ Deals</h3>
      <p>Another pair of GHD straighteners, still with 1in ceramic plates and a max temp of 185ºC, but here with a unique wishbone hinge. The unique draw of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fghd-platinum%2Fghd-platinum-plus-black-styler">GHD Platinum+</a> is the smart tech inside, with a matrix of sensors hidden below the 1in ceramic plates constantly measuring temperature (250 times a second). The ultra-zone predictive tech intelligently adapts to your styling technique, adjusting the power to ensure an optimum temperature at all times for healthier hair (with 70% less breakage and double the colour protection) and faster, better results. This is single-stroke styling at its best, suitable for all hair types. You'll get a bundled plate guard and a three-year warranty.</p>
      <p>The retail price is £189. Read our full <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/health-beauty/ghd-platinum-plus-3683623/">GHD Platinum+ review</a>.</p>

      <h3>Best GHD Mini Deals</h3>
      <p>Best for shorter hair, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fmini%2Fghd-mini-styler">GHD Mini</a> has 1.5in ceramic plates and, as with the rest of the range, can heat up to 185ºC. This design has a rounded barrel that makes it easier to get up close to the root, and the Mini also comes with the protective plate guard. The retail price is £119. </p>

      <h3>Best GHD Max Deals</h3>
      <p>If the GHD Mini Styler is best suited to short hair, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fmax%2Fghd-max-styler">GHD Max Styler</a> is best suited to long hair. Aside from the 2in ceramic plates, which are the thickest in the range, it is otherwise very similar with a rounded barrel, 2.7m power cable, protective plate guard and max temp of 185ºC.</p>
      <p>The retail price is £149, which ties it with the GHD Gold, but remember that the Gold also has dual-zone heating technology.</p>

      <h3>Best GHD Air Deals</h3>
      <p>Said to be twice as fast as a regular hairdryer, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fhair-dryers%2Fghd-air">GHD Air</a> has a place in the hearts of all GHD fans. This 2,100W hairdryer has a removable air filter, and advance ionic tech to reduce frizz and flyaways. You can adjust the heat and power, and there's a cool shot button for setting your style. The GHD Air retails at £99. Read our full <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/health-beauty/ghd-air-hair-dryer-review-3683113/">GHD Air review</a>.</p>

      <h3>Best GHD Curve Deals</h3>
      <p>GHD has four variations on its Curve Tong, each with ultra-zone tech that heats up to 185ºC consistently across the ceramic barrel in just 25 seconds.</p>
      <p>Two have a metallic clamp, with the key difference between the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Ftongs%2Fghd-curve-soft-curl-tong">Soft Curl Tong</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Ftongs%2Fghd-curve-classic-curl-tong">Classic Curl Tong</a> being the size of the barrel: 32mm vs 26mm, making the Classic Curl Tong more suitable for shorter styles.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fwands%2Fghd-curve-creative-curl-wand">Creative Curl Wand</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685545-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-ghd-deals-3685545%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fwands%2Fghd-curve-classic-wave-wand">Classic Wave Wand</a> are differentiated by the shape of their barrel, with the oval-shaped Creative Curl Wand best for creating 'Beach Waves', and the tapered Classic Wave Wand best for 'Hollywood Waves'.</p>
      <p>All four retail at £129, but you will find cheaper deals online.</p>
