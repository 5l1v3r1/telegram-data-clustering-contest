      <h1>PlayStation Now Australia release potentially teased by ad</h1>

      <h3>"We have nothing to announce at this time," Sony told Stevivor.</h3>
      <p>The Australian release of <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/playstation-now/">PlayStation Now</a> may have just been teased after an ad for the service was spotted on PS4 dashboards over the weekend.</p>
      <p>First spotted by <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2019/12/07/playstation-now-could-be-coming-to-australia/">Press-Start</a>, the ad appeared on the Australian-facing PS4 PlayStation Store, though when clicked displayed a page that read, “this content cannot be selected at this time.”</p>
      <p>“We have nothing to announce at this time,” a Sony Interactive Entertainment spokesperson told Stevivor when asked about PlayStation Now Australian availability or if the ad was incorrectly placed.</p>
      <p>PlayStation Now is a streaming service that offers a library of over 800 PS2, PS3 and PS4 games for $9.99 USD a month. The service is currently avaliable in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In September 2018, subscribers have been able to download and play select games rather than stream them — something that’s likely quite important if we’re talking about an Australian release.</p>
