      <p>Guests are now stealing mattresses from five star hotels, along with televisions, shower heads, artwork and coffee makers.</p>
      <p>The luxury beds are worth so much and are filled with so much technology that they have become a target for thieves, a survey has revealed.</p>
      <p>Researchers said that the difficulty of walking past a reception desk with a super-kingsize means that most mattresses go missing at night, in hotels that have lifts directly serving underground car parks.</p>
      <p>Mattresses with memory foam or temperature controls means many hotels are selling rooms on the comfort of their beds, some of which cost thousands of pounds.</p>

      <p>It is unclear whether the mattresses were being replaced with old ones to make discovery of the crime less immediately likely, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mattresses-are-the-new-target-for-thieves-at-five-star-hotels-fs8d9kml3"><b>The Times</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>The study found that five-star hotels were eight times more likely to have their mattresses stolen than four-star hotels. </p>
      <p>They are not the only unlikely items to go missing. Luxury bathroom fittings, such as 'rain effect' shower heads, have been unscrewed.</p>
      <p>Televisions, artwork and coffee-makers have all disappeared too.</p>
      <p>One Austrian Spa hotel had a pine bench stolen from a guest's private sauna. In Italy a hotel reported that a grand piano had been taken from its lobby. </p>

      <p>The owner said: 'I noticed that something was missing, and soon after I learnt that three unknown men in overalls had taken away the grand piano. It never reappeared.'</p>
      <p>The survey was carried out with 1,157 hoteliers by Wellness Heaven, the Spa hotel review website.</p>
      <p>It found that British guests were generally less ambitious in their crimes and were most likely to steal towels, bathrobes and toiletries.     </p>
