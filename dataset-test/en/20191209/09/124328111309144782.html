      <p>Extinction Rebellion protesters in hi-vis jackets glued themselves to concrete blocks outside Leicester Square tube station to campaign against air pollution this morning.</p>
      <p>It is the latest demonstration as part of the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html"><b>climate change</b></a> group's '12 Days of Crisis' which is due to run until the day before polling on December 11.</p>
      <p>As part of its latest stunt, a number of activists dressed in gas masks, hard hats and hi-viz jackets have glued themselves to yellow concrete blocks, on Cranbourne Street, in central <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/london/index.html"><b>London</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Model Lily Cole also addressed protesters and went to listen to campaigners in their fourth week of being on hunger strike outside the Conservative Party headquarters.  </p>
      <p>The demonstration, called The Air We Grieve, involved 25 cement blocks which the activists said represents the number of Londoners who die each day as a result of air pollution.</p>
      <p>At either end of the protest are signs saying 'all I want for X-Mas is clean air' and 'air pollution kills 25 Londoners a day.' </p>
      <p>One protester, teacher Rosamund Frost, said: 'We are here demanding action on illegal levels of toxic air in our communities, our schools and our streets.</p>

      <p>'In February 2017, the European Commission issued a 'final warning' to the UK over illegal levels of air pollution.</p>
      <p>'In May that year, after the Government failed to take decisive action, they were taken to Europe's highest court, the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p>'The Government have neglected to tackle fatal levels of air pollution. How can we put our trust in them to address the broader climate and ecological emergency?'</p>
      <p>Police arrived at the demonstration earlier this morning, which protesters said has 'dangerously high levels of air pollution'.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other Extinction Rebellion protesters were entering their fourth week on hunger strike outside political party headquarters in Westminster.</p>
      <p>The strikers, including 76-year-old grandfather Peter Cole, have sent a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, inviting him to discuss the climate and ecological emergency with them on Monday.</p>

      <p>Sunday December 1 -  Protesters took part in 'Sound the Alarm', using air raid sirens and pots and pans to replicate the future of a 'decimated planet'</p>
      <p>Monday December 2 - Mothers and babies held a 'feed-in' at the headquarters of the main political parties.</p>
      <p>Wednesday December 4 - A number of 'die-ins' took place on the campaign trail to remind politicians about the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>Thursday December 5 - The group drew attention to the increased risk of flooding by holding a extreme weather forecast. Some of it was read out by Hollywood actor Emma Thompson.</p>
      <p>Sunday December 8 -  A mass lie-in in front of a bulldozer at Heathrow after cycling there to protest against the controversial third runway.</p>
      <p>Monday December 9 - Protesters glued themselves to concrete blocks in central London to protest against air pollution.</p>
      <p>Wednesday December 11 - The action will highlight the distance between manifesto promises on the Climate and Ecological Emergency and the critically short time we have to affect change in a country still wedded to fossil fuels.</p>

      <p>A Metropolitan Police spokesman said in a statement today: 'Police are aware of a small number of protesters outside Leicester Square Underground station.</p>
      <p>'Officers are in attendance.'</p>
      <p>Social media users had decidedly mixed feelings about the protest with some praising the peaceful action, while others slammed the group for disrupting commuters.</p>
      <p>James Drake said: 'Hey, kudos. A peaceful protest on an important topic. More than most do.'</p>
      <p>Twitter user Orgogg said: 'Put barriers round them and leave them until they get bored.'</p>
      <p>And Anthony Lock said: 'Stopping people commuting to work to put food on tables is disgusting. Time the law gets tough on the rebellion. Know one else can get away with it.'</p>
      <p>In Manchester, five people were arrested after a number of Extinction Rebellion protesters blocked rush hour traffic on a busy street.  </p>
      <p>A number of climate change campaigners donning orange overalls stopped traffic by attaching themselves to concrete blocks in Great Ancoats Street.</p>
      <p>A report found levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the Ancoats area have been well above the legal limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre for some time. </p>
      <p>The Manchester protestors also held banners with the Extinction Rebellion logo and calling on the government to act on air pollution problems. </p>
      <p>Stagecoach bus services had to be diverted.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion Manchester posted on social media: 'Please support our rebels who are blocking a road in central Manchester to raise awareness of the devastating impacts of climate change. Thank you.'</p>

      <p>One driver caught up in the chaos was a mother with a hungry four-month-old baby.</p>
      <p>Her partner told <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/traffic-blocked-climate-change-ancoats-17385850"><b>Manchester Evening News</b></a>: 'She had our little baby in the car. The police aren't being helpful, they are saying you are going to have to move.</p>
      <p>'It took her one hour 20 minutes to complete a 15 minute journey. The baby is only four months old and needed feeding.</p>
      <p>'One of the protesters did try to get her through, but the leader said they can't let anybody through.</p>
      <p>'This is not the way to engender empathy for their cause. We are all concerned about the climate, but there are many more ways of going about it.</p>
      <p>'They could show decency and compassion when someone has got a baby.'</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Police said they are attempting to keep disruption to a minimum and are advising for drivers to plan ahead before travelling.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Chris Hill of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: 'I would like to thank our agency partners for their support and the public for their patience.</p>
      <p>'Whilst we respect everyone's right to lawful protest, we ask that anyone intending on protesting in Manchester also respect the right of others to go about their daily business with minimal disruption, and to liaise with the local authorities in advance.'</p>
      <p>Councillor Nigel Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, said: 'We were not aware of a planned protest today and we would ask demonstrators to respect the rights of people trying to go about their day.</p>
      <p>'We will work with our partners at GMP and TfGM to help minimise the impact of the protest.</p>
      <p>'Of course, we absolutely recognise the urgency to promote debate and actively tackle the urgent issue of climate change.</p>
      <p>'We have set an ambitious target of making Manchester a zero carbon city by at least 2038 - 12 years earlier than the national target.'</p>

      <p>Yesterday Extinction Rebellion protesters staged a mass lie-in in front of a bulldozer at Heathrow after cycling there to protest against the controversial third runway.</p>
      <p>When the cyclists arrived at the airport, they performed a 'bulldozer lie-in' and acted out the future destruction bulldozers will cause when they begin building the controversial third runway.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson and John McDonnell were invited to attend the protest by the eco activists but neither responded to correspondence.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the group told MailOnline the protest was a 'success' and around 300 people took part.</p>
      <p>They said: 'This was a relatively chilled action. If they actually start going ahead with the third runway, people will have to stop them and the action would be much more arrestable.'</p>
      <p>The action at Heathrow did not cause any disruption to flights in and out of the airport.</p>
