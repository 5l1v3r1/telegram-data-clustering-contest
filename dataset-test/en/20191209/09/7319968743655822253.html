        <b>JFK's daughter Caroline Kennedy christened the new US Navy aircraft carrier, the USS John F. Kennedy, at a ceremony on Dec 7. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The former ambassador to Japan and President John F. Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, christened the US Navy aircraft carrier, previously known as CVN 79, with its official name <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/news/john-f-kennedy-aircraft-carrier">the USS John F. Kennedy</a> on Sat, Dec 7, 2019. </p>
      <p>The former president's daughter smashed a bottle of sparkling wine against the ship's hull, as is tradition, at Huntington Ingalls Industries, in Newport, Virginia, where the USS <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/john-f-kennedy-life">John F. Kennedy</a> was built. </p>

      <p>Over 3,000 shipbuilders and 2,000 suppliers have been involved in the construction of the ship since its keel was laid in 2015. The USS John F Kennedy is a nuclear-powered ship and is expected to enter service in the US Navy in 2020. </p>
      <p>On May 29, 2019, the aircraft carrier's 588 metric ton island was landed. Symbolically, on what would have been President John F Kennedy's 102nd birthday. </p>
      <p>While his daughter was unable to attend that ceremony she did send a message which read "I know how proud my father would be of the ship that will bear his name and the patriotism and dedication of all who will sail in her."</p>

      <p>Caroline also christened the first aircraft carrier named in honor of her father in 1967. Nicknamed "Big John," the ship was decommissioned in 2007 and was the last American aircraft carrier to be powered by conventional fuel.</p>
      <p>In November 2019, the official seal of the USS John F Kennedy was revealed. At the time it was noted that in addition to honoring JFK's own naval service and vision for space exploration it also featured a drawing of the aircraft carriers including aircraft on its deck, giving a clue to what this vessel would be used for.</p>
      <p>Cmdr. Jennifer Cragg of Naval Air Force Atlantic confirmed that the seal "displays future naval aviation capabilities that the aircraft carrier will likely support throughout its estimated 50-year service life."</p>

      <p>At the age of 23, having graduated from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in government and international affairs, John F. Kennedy was medically disqualified from entering the Army Officer Candidate School due to lower back problems.</p>
      <p>After a year of exercising and strengthening his back and with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), Kennedy joined the United States Naval Reserve, on September 24, 1941.</p>
      <p>He went on to serve in World War II and went on to be awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism and the Purple Heart Medal for injuries.</p>
