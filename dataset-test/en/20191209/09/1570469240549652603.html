      <p>New Zealand police said at least one person was killed and more fatalities were likely, after an <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/100-people-near-new-zealand-volcano-when-it-erupted-pm-jacinda-ardern-267054">island volcano</a> popular with tourists erupted Monday, leaving dozens stranded.</p>
      <p>"I can confirm there is one fatality," said deputy commissioner John Tims. "There is a number still remaining on the island who are currently unaccounted for," he added, "at this stage, it is too dangerous for police and rescue services to go to the island."</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/100-people-near-new-zealand-volcano-when-it-erupted-pm-jacinda-ardern-267054">Jacinda Ardern</a> confirmed some of those caught up in the disaster were foreigners. "We know that there were a number of tourists on or around the island at the time, both New Zealanders and visitors from overseas."</p>
      <p>White Island is New Zealand's most active volcano cone and about 70 per cent of it is underwater, according to government agency GeoNet.</p>
      <p>Around 10,000 people visit the volcano every year. It has erupted frequently over the last half-century, most recently in 2016.</p>
      <p>In August of that year, the New Zealand Defence Force airlifted a 2.4-tonne shipping container onto the island to serve as an emergency shelter in case of an eruption.</p>
