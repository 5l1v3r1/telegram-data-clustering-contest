      <p>NZ Bus services are off the road, and Auckland Transport says Ritchies will operate limited morning and evening rush hour bus services along Dominion and Mt Eden roads.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/service-announcements/updated-sunday-8-december-all-nz-bus-services-cancelled-from-saturday-7-december/">cancelled routes</a> include NZ Bus school buses and Link routes.</p>
      <p>Services run by other operators are not affected, and train and ferry services will run as normal.</p>
      <p>NZ Bus drivers seeking better pay and conditions refused to collect fares last week, and now those drivers have been suspended.</p>
