      <h1>Garth Crooks praises ‘amazing’ Everton ace Mason Holgate</h1>
      <h2>The 23-year-old was a standout performer as the Toffees shocked Chelsea.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:45:49+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/leeclarke/" target="_blank">Lee Clarke</a></address>

        <b><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50706000">BBC Sport </a>pundit Garth Crooks has hailed Everton defender Mason Holgate as ‘amazing’ during their shock 3-1 victory over Chelsea at the weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former striker Duncan Ferguson took the managerial reigns following Marco Silva’s sacking in midweek.</p>
      <p>He got an instant response from his players with Holgate looking extremely competent at centre-back.</p>
      <p>Crooks chose Holgate as one of the defenders in his Team of the Week and he was surprised by the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50706000">He told BBC Sport:</a> “I never saw Mason Holgate as an imposing central defender but I thought he was amazing in the rejuvenated, never-say-die Everton team against Chelsea.</p>

      <p>“The block on Christian Pulisic was important but his overall contribution to his team’s efforts was quite brilliant.”</p>
      <p>The Toffees shock result came after Ferguson reverted to a 4-4-2 during his first game in caretaker charge.</p>
      <p>Theo Walcott was recalled on the right, with Morgan Schneiderlin earning a start in midfield.</p>
      <p>The unlikely win was never really in doubt. Richarlison netted after five minutes before Dominic Calvert-Lewin added a second just after the break.</p>
      <p>Mateo Kovacic did pull one back but the Toffees weren’t to be denied. Calvert-Lewin’s second of the afternoon ensured victory six minutes from time.</p>
      <h3>Resurgent</h3>
      <p>Everton’s resolve was pleasing though. After shipping five goals in midweek at Liverpool a response was required and boy did Ferguson get one.</p>

      <p>Holgate has enjoyed a run in the team recently and he will hope to stay there under the new boss.</p>
      <p>He spent last season on loan at West Brom, helping the Baggies to the Championship play-offs where they were beaten by Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been patient this season. He didn’t start the season as the first choice but injuries have seen him thrust into the limelight.</p>
      <p>Crooks including him in the Team of the Week is a reward for a fine performance. The challenge for the £25,000-a-week <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/everton-f.c/payroll/">(Spotrac)</a> enforcer it to now find that level of performance on a consistent basis.</p>
