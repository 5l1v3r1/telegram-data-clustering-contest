      <p>A doctor and his three-year-old son have been missing for four days and their family had reported it to the police.</p>
      <p>Dr Aye Zaw Tun and his son, San Thuta Mon, ate dinner with Myo Min Aung and Waiyan Tun, friends of Dr Aye Zaw Tun, on December 5 and went back home around 10 pm. However, Dr Aye Zaw Tun and his son didn’t come back that night. His father, Aye Hlaing, reported it to Mupon police station.</p>
      <p>“He closed his clinics around 8 pm and ate dinner. He went out with his son after that. When I looked for him after ten, he didn’t arrive home. At that time, his mother went to listen to religious talk. They didn’t arrive home after his mother came back home. We slept and found his room still remained shut after I woke up during the night. I thought they are sleeping. I saw his door is opened in the morning and thought he is preparing to open his clinic. When his wife called me and asked for him, I found out that he is not in his room. By then, I am sure that they didn’t come back last night,” said Myint Myint Sein, a cousin of the missing doctor.</p>
      <p>“We are worried that they are still missing. His father said he will go out and search for them. I told him not to go out at night and will search for them in the morning. We rang his mobile phone but it was switched off,” said his mother Mya Mya Win.</p>
      <p>Police, social welfare associations and his friends are looking for him.</p>
