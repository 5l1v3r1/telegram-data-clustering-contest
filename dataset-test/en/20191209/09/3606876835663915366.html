        <b>The government of Ghana says it is on course to secure Parliamentary approval for GH¢15.6 billion bailout for the financial sector clean-up.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This follows after some media reports showed that Parliament had rejected the request.</p>
      <p>The Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, who is also a member of the Finance Committee of Parliament who disclosed the information stated that contrary to the media reports, the request has not been rejected.</p>
      <p>"The committee held a meeting on Thursday, 5th December 2019, and received the government’s request and even explored if the government could spend a bit more on the exercise.</p>
      <p>The report of the committee is expected to be taken to the plenary this week for parliamentary approval," he said.</p>
      <p>President Akufo-Addo had, earlier, given executive approval for the Ministry of Finance to proceed to parliament for approval</p>
      <p>Mr Oppong Nkrumah said this was an indication of the President’s commitment to ensuring that depositors who were affected will receive their funds and improve the liquidity of the financial sector.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>The banking sector has since 2017 seen series of clean up exercises carried out by the Bank of Ghana and the Security and Exchange Commission.</p>
      <p>Government believes the requested amount will give the necessary support the sector requires to bounce back on its feet and be stronger.</p>
