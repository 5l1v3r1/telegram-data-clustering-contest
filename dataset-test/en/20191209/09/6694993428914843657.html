      <p>Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof has praised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tactics following their win over Manchester City at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>The Swedish centre-back excelled at the back alongside <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire">Harry Maguire</a> in <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United's</a> 2-1 win against the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> champions and confirmed Solskjaer had changed the team's tactics for the clash.</p>
      <p>Roberto Martinez, who was a pundit for the game for the Premier League, asked <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/victor-lindelof">Lindelof</a> if the defenders had been instructed to play out from the back.</p>
      <p>"Yeah. Obviously we want to play from the back and we tried it a few times today, with some various results," he said on Premier League TV.</p>
      <p>"We need to be brave and try to play and that starts from the back with me, David and Harry [Maguire]. So Iâ€™m just trying to that do myself from the back and try to build it up from the back and give the ball to the front players because those are the ones that should have the ball and those are the ones that can create chances for us."</p>
      <p>The result pushed United up to fifth in the table and capped off a big week for the club with the win against Tottenham three days before, and Lindelof admitted he was pleased with this team's performance.</p>
      <p>"I think as a unit today we defended very, very well all over the pitch so I want to say well done to all my teammates," he said.</p>
      <p>"You have to stay focused throughout the game and that's what we did today. Obviously we wanted to get a clean sheet but we take the three points."</p>
