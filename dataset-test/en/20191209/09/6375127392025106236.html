      <h3>PATRICIA Javier looks very queenly indeed at the thanksgiving lunch hosted by Noble Queen of the Universe where she won the crown. The pageant will have a delayed telecast at Net25 on December 14, so you can watch her how she bagged the title and bested the other contestants.</h3>
      <p>“I chose to join Noble Queen of the Universe as it’s an advocacy pageant,” she says. “Ang dami raw nag-apply as candidates, but they didn’t qualify kasi you have to have an existing advocacy that’s really for a worthy cause. Mine was health and wellness and women empowerment.”</p>
      <p>Patricia will be leaving with her husband, Dr. Rob Walcher, and their two sons on December 18 for their annual Christmas reunion with the family of Doc Rob in the U.S. They will have a white Christmas in Reno, Nevada then Patricia will participate in a fashion show for a cause in San Diego, California featuring the creations of Fil-Am designer Richard Barlis, with the proceeds going to children with autism.</p>
      <p>Present at the thanksgiving lunch were Beau Singson from Australia as Noble Queen Globe, Jill Chapman of USA Westcoast as Noble Queen Earth, 1st runner up Ritchell Catt from Guam, Anne Villanueva from Mindanao as Ambassador for Health and Wellness, Ellen Stokes of Las Vegas as Ambassador for Humanity and Jeanette Kamphuis of Sweden as Ambassador for the Environment.  </p>
      <p>Their next activities include attending the Hope for Lupus Foundation Christmas party and helping the victims of typhoon Tisoy in Bicol and the earthquake victims in North Cotabato. Jeanette Kamphuis of Sweden is also holding an exhibit of her painting and the proceeds will go to Operation Smile that will help operate on children with cleft lips and palate through an expert plastic surgeon.</p>
      <p>“As you can see, this is not just another ordinary pageant as we really aim to IEextend help to people in need,” adds Patricia who says she’s now ready to go back to acting after bagging the Noble Queen of the Universe title. “My husband and I also plan to go into movie production by next year. We will coordinate with Viva as we want to do a film about the experiences of Overseas Filipino Workers to help them and their families.”</p>
