      <p>In Executive Order No. 99, the President enjoined the Sangguniang Barangays to enact ordinances on the Yuletide aid for the “economic empowerment” of the village officials and workers.</p>
      <p>The government recognized the barangay workers’ “unconditional and passionate service” to their communities despite limited resources, logistics, facilities, and remuneration, according to the latest EO.</p>
      <p>“Barangay officials and functionaries are at the forefront in the delivery of essential and basic government services, such as health care, social welfare, agricultural support, settlement of disputes, peace, and order, and the promotion of the general interest of the community,” the order read.</p>
      <p>“The Yuletide season is an opportune time to establish such measures or programs for the economic empowerment of barangay officials and functionaries in recognition of their valuable and meaningful service that effect genuine and positive change in their communities consistent with the provisions of the Local Government Code,” it added.</p>
      <p>Under the new presidential order, the funds for the Yuletide assistance package will be sourced from the respective available funds of the Sangguniang Barangays. Among those covered by the assistance package are punong barangay, barangay secretary, barangay treasurer, barangay tanods, members of the Lupong Tagapamayapa, and other workers appointed, designated or engaged by the barangay.</p>
      <p>The Department of Interior and Local Government and the Department of Budget and Management have been directed to craft the guidelines including the criteria and parameters for qualified barangay officials to effectively implement the President’s latest directive. For the succeeding years, the concerned agencies must study and propose measures for the social assistance package for barangay workers and identify the funding sources.</p>
      <p>The order took effect immediately. It was signed by the President last December 6.</p>
