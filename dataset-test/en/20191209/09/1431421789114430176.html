      <p>Should the Israeli Knesset dissolve by Wednesday as expected, the next election will be held on March 2, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and its main political opponent, Benny Gantz's Kahol Lavan, agreed on Monday.</p>
      <p>The new date is eight days earlier than the original - March 10 - and alters a tradition enshrined in law, which stipulates that elections in Israel be held on a Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In order to permit the move, an amendment to the Basic Law on the Government is required. The Knesset's Arrangements Committee would need to approve it, and later in the week lawmakers will vote on it in three readings.</p>
      <p>The legislative proceedings are expected to begin on Monday, and must conclude by Wednesday at midnight, when the deadline to form a government expires and the Knesset is forced to disband.</p>
