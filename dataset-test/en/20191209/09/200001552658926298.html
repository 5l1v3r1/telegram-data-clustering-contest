      <h1>Leicester City sent official for prolific forward on Friday night – Could be January addition for title challenge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:46:05+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/yagosabuncuoglu/status/1203019798453637121">Haber Global’s Fenerbahce journalist Yagiz Sabuncuoglu</a>, Leicester City watched Fenerbahce striker Vedat Muriqi in action on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Sabuncuoglu claims that along with the Premier League side, AS Monaco and Eintracht Frankfurt also sent scouts to monitor the 25 year old, who scored twice during Fener’s 5-2 win over Genclerbirligi.</p>
      <p>Muriqi’s overall performance was once again impressive, and the former Caykur Rizespor player was one of the standout players. With his brace against Genclerbirligi, Muriqi has now scored 10 goals in 14 appearances for Fener in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The Kosovan striker has been linked with moves to the likes of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United in recent months, and now Leicester look to be in the mix for the player.</p>
      <p>Leicester City are currently sitting 2nd in the Premier League after 16 games, eight points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers could be looking to strengthen his squad in the new year to maintain their title challenge, and Muriqi would be an interesting addition.</p>
