      <h1>Brendan Rodgers begins his Title-Race mind-games with Klopp…</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:25:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers has predictably painted his Leicester City side as the underdogs in this year’s title race, which in fairness, they are!</p>
      <p>The Foxes have won eight on the bounce and are eight points behind us in second place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Crucially though, they’re now six points ahead of out of form Manchester City and as a result many believe they’ll be our closest challengers for top spot come May.</p>
      <p>Rodgers, though, has separated Leicester from the quality of ourselves and City – claiming his only target is to continue ‘developing as a team’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“I don’t think anyone expects us to be near the top,” he said, cited in the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1214728/Leicester-City-news-Brendan-Rodgers-Liverpool-Premier-League-title-challenge">Express</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“After Manchester United won at Manchester City on Saturday, the caption came up about how far City are away from Liverpool.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“We respect that, we get on with our work and keep developing as a team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“It’s just natural, Man City and Liverpool are both incredible teams.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“We know we are looking to improve and close the gap.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“We have finished ninth in the last two seasons but today we looked like a top team.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leicester are in the position they are because they deserve to be, first and foremost.</p>
      <p>They have an excellent manager and many superb players including the Premier League’s most prolific striker Jamie Vardy.</p>
      <p>Luckily for us, though, they face Manchester City in 11 days’ time, meaning one of them is going to drop points…</p>
      <p>We then face the Foxes on Boxing Day following our return from Qatar in what is a potentially enormous fixture.</p>
