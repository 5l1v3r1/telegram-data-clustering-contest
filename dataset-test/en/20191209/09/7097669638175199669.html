      <h1>TV crew laugh at Ted Cruz in live interview after he endorses Trump's baseless conspiracy theory</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:53:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Conrad Duncan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ted-cruz">Ted Cruz</a> was laughed at by a TV crew during a live interview after he endorsed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>’s baseless conspiracy theory about <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>
      <p>The Texas senator, who challenged Mr Trump to be the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/republicans">Republican</a> nominee in 2016, was mocked for saying he believed there was “considerable evidence” that Ukraine meddled in the most recent presidential election.</p>
      <p>The US intelligence community has concluded that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Russia">Russia</a>, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election and senior officials have said it is a “fictional narrative” to suggest Ukraine was involved.</p>
      <p>NBC host <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chuck-todd">Chuck Todd</a> questioned Mr Cruz on why he would trust Mr Trump’s claims about Ukraine after he was involved in a bitter feud with the president during the 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>“You went through a primary campaign with this president. He launched a ‘birtherism’ campaign against you, he went after your faith, he threatened to ‘spill the beans’ about your wife about something…” Mr Todd said.</p>
      <p>“Is it not possible that this president is capable of creating a false narrative about somebody in order to help him politically?”</p>
      <p>However, Mr Cruz rejected that suggestion because Mr Trump released a memorandum of his call with Ukrainian president <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> which he claims proves his innocence.</p>
      <p>The president is accused of withholding military aid and the offer of a White House meeting to Ukraine to pressure Mr Zelensky into announcing an investigation into his 2020 election rival <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a>.</p>
      <p>Although he has denied any wrongdoing, multiple US officials have come forward with concerns about his conduct.</p>
      <p>In response to the allegations, multiple Republican senators and members of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/congress">Congress</a> have spread baseless or discredited conspiracy theories about Ukraine’s role in the 2016 election and Mr Biden’s son Hunter.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democrats">Democratic</a> representative <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jerry-nadler">Jerry Nadler</a> was asked by Mr Todd whether the president would allow a fair election in 2020 if he is acquitted in the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Mr Nadler, who is the chairman of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/house-judiciary-committee">House Judiciary Committee</a> investigating Mr Trump, replied: “I don’t know. The president, based on his past performance, will do everything he can to make it not a fair election and that is part of what gives us the urgency to proceed with this impeachment”</p>
      <p>The chairman also said on Sunday that a vote in Congress on impeachment charges against the president could take place this week.</p>
      <p>If the articles of impeachment are passed, Mr Trump will be tried in the Republican-controlled <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/senate">Senate</a>.</p>
      <p>A two-thirds majority of senators must vote to convict Mr Trump for him to be removed from office.</p>
