      <h1>Dundee United striker Nicky Clark keen to sign new deal</h1>
      <h2>Nicky Clark is hoping to become the latest Dundee United player to get his long-term Tannadice future sorted out.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/ericnicolson/" target="_blank">Eric Nicolson</a></address>
      <p>Sporting director Tony Asghar has secured player after player on extended deals in recent months and Clark wants to be the next cab off the rank.</p>
      <p>The timing certainly feels right as, after scoring for the fourth game in a row, the former Rangers and Dunfermline man feels this could be his best run of form in a United shirt since arriving at Tannadice.</p>
      <p>“Maybe, aye,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There was a spell towards the end of last season when I got a few goals but I’m delighted with how things are going for me just now and long may it continue.</p>
      <p>“I definitely want to stay here.</p>
      <p>“I’m really enjoying it. Last year was so disappointing and I want to help get this club back to where we belong and play in the Premiership for them.</p>
      <p>“If my future is here then I’ll be delighted.”</p>
      <p>There is long-term planning off the pitch but manager Robbie Neilson has got his players focused on short-term football goals.</p>
      <p>After making it six wins out of six against Alloa on Saturday, United will get the chance to open up a 10-point gap on nearest challengers Inverness Caley Thistle by beating Morton at Cappielow tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>“The focus goes straight on to Tuesday night,” said Clark. “Confidence is high and it’s a case of looking to beat the next team that is put in front of us.</p>
      <p>“It’s a game in hand for us on some teams so it’s important we take advantage of that.”</p>
      <p>Clark and Louis Appere made sure Neilson could keep Lawrence Shankland on the bench but a return for the team’s talisman is imminent.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to see him back in the squad,” said Clark.</p>
      <p>“He’s been working really hard on his fitness. We need to make sure he’s right and we don’t want to rush him.</p>
      <p>“If me and Louis can keep scoring it takes the pressure off.”</p>
      <p>Clark scored in first half stoppage time after United, who had bombarded the Alloa goal, had fallen behind to a Mark Reynolds own goal.</p>
      <p>Appere finished off an inch perfect Ian Harkes cross on 55 minutes and then it was a case of an ever-maturing Tangerines team seeing the game out with a minimum of drama.</p>
      <p>“I thought we started really well and Jamie MacDonald has made a few good saves,” said Clark.</p>
      <p>“Then they get a freak goal but we stuck at it and scored just before half-time.</p>
      <p>“A bank of four and a bank of five is hard to break down but we got a goal quite quickly in the second half and were able to get our win.</p>
      <p>“The three points was all we were after.”</p>
      <p>Clark’s goal was the pivotal moment of the match, according to Neilson.</p>
      <p>“It was very important that we scored just before half-time,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I thought we had played very well in that first half and we’d have been disappointed to go in one down.</p>
      <p>“Getting that goal gave us the platform to go on and win.</p>
      <p>“Alloa were very good again but we deserved our win. Whether you win 6-0 or 2-1 it’s still three points.</p>
      <p>“The big thing was we responded well to adversity. The fans stuck behind the team after we lost the goal. There was no negativity from the stands which was important.”</p>
      <p>There was nothing in the Alloa performance for their players to be ashamed of but Peter Grant believed – not for the first time – his side were the victim of a poor refereeing decision.</p>
      <p>He said: “When you hear the Dundee United fans whistling for the full-time whistle that<br/>tells you everything about how we finished.</p>
      <p>“For the winning goal, how can Scott Taggart be five yards in front and then Appere ends up five yards in front?</p>
      <p>“There’s only one way – because he pulls him back.</p>
      <p>“I thought some of the decisions at times were mind-blowing.”</p>
