      <h1>Just eight people turn up to get a free cash handout in Ilkeston</h1>
      <h2>It was available to pensioners living in a certain area</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T09:28:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 09:28</time> by <a rel="author">Rod Malcolm</a></address>
      <p>It sounds too good to be true. But free money was on hand for OAPs living in parts of Ilkeston - if only they asked for it.</p>
      <p>The £5 payout comes from the profits of a tote run by the Old Park Pensioners' Society.</p>
      <p>It was available at the weekend (December 7/8) - perfect for Christmas.</p>
      <p>A total of 180 people were expected to drop into the Welcome Hall in St John's Road, have a free cup of tea and leave with a fiver in an envelope.</p>
      <p>But only eight turned up, and the rest of the money is now safely back in the bank.</p>
      <p>President Ann Bagshaw, 79, said: "We had the money ready in envelopes and expected plenty of people.</p>
      <p>"We had tea and biscuits but only eight people came, had a chat and left with their money.</p>

      <p>"I know it is only £5 but it must be worth something. People only had to turn up.</p>
      <p>"Once we used to lay on sandwiches and people would stop and talk for a long time, making a trip of it."</p>
      <p>Three years ago, the group handed out £1,500, but once often distributed £5,000 annually.</p>
      <p>The organisation owns the hall which runs bingo sessions, flower shows, keep fit classes and dance lessons.</p>
      <p>Pensioners have to live near the hall to get the money. Organisers hope they will still get in touch for their fivers.</p>
      <p>The society takes its name from the Old Park ward of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ilkeston">Ilkeston</a> Borough Council, an authority which was replaced by Erewash over 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>To qualify, pensioners have to live in that area, which takes in the Larklands housing estate, Gallows Inn and Green Lane.</p>
