      <h3>Who won last year's award?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2018/12/16/bbc-spoty-2018-live-results-voting-sports-personality-winner/">As our own Tom Cary put it in his report on the night:</a> </p>
      <blockquote>In extraordinary week for cycling and for Team Sky ended last night with 2018 Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year at the Resorts World Arena in Birmingham. Thomas, 32, beat Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton into second place, with England striker Harry Kane third. As ever with Spoty, there was just as much debate over those who failed to make the cut as those who did. Georgia Hall, who won her first major title with a two-shot victory at the Women's British Open at Royal Lytham and St Annes, was omitted from the six-person shortlist - her contribution to the sporting year given just 10 seconds of airtime during the glitzy ceremony - as was Tyson Fury, who climbed off the canvas earlier this month to secure a dramatic draw with heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder out in Los Angeles.</blockquote>
