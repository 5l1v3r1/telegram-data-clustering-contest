      <p>Are you looking to indulge in something sparkly this holiday season and give back while doing so? </p>
      <p>Castanet has partnered with <a href="https://www.premierpawn.com/">Premier Jewellery and Loans</a> for the fourth annual diamond earring fundraiser to benefit the <a href="https://kelownawomensshelter.ca/">Kelowna Women's Shelter.</a></p>
      <p>This year, Premier has created a pair of 14-carat white gold, halo-design earrings.</p>
      <p>"Every year, we build a set of diamond earrings, we auction them online via Castanet, and 100 per cent of the proceeds actually get donated to the Kelowna Women's Shelter," says Martin Strasser, owner of Premier Jewellery and Loans.</p>
      <p>The bidding starts at $500, and the set is appraised at $11,200. </p>
      <p>"This is a really important time of year. During the school breaks, women are likely to make a move and decide they're not going to live with violence anymore, and they move their children to the transition house," says Debby Hamilton, with the women's shelter.</p>
      <p>"One of the programs that this will fund is the outreach, which helps women before they leave, after they leave and times in between."</p>
      <p>Last year, the fundraiser raised $7,000.</p>
      <p>Bidding is on now until Dec. 19 at noon. To bid, click <a href="http://www.castanet.net/pjauction/">here.</a></p>
