      <p>Romeo captured the festivities of the zero-gravity illusion experience in Winter Wonderland's Upside Down house.</p>
      <p>Posh and Becks' second oldest son perfected the ultimate hilarious poses to make it look like he was balancing on his head and lying on the ceiling in a series of clever snaps.</p>
      <p>The teen looked ready to brave London's freezing temperatures as he donned a khaki and black puffer jacket with a vibrant yellow hoody and black jeans.</p>
      <p>David was seen riding the dodgems with his kids, as well as taking them on all the roller coasters and attractions.</p>
      <p>It looks like Becks put his fairground games skills to the test and came out on top, much to the delight of daughter Harper.</p>

      <p>Things got a bit wild for the Beckham clan as they decided to seek some thrills on the fairground rides.</p>
      <p>Becks and the kids had some fun as they had a go on the rollercoaster, waltzers and the swings.</p>

      <p>The photo was deemed "inappropriate" by some with GMB star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/piers-morgan">Piers Morgan</a> also blasting the football star.</p>
      <p>During a chat about the controversial photo on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/good-morning-britain">Good Morning Britain</a> , Piers argued: "It's just weird right? Who does that with their kids? Who kisses their kids on the lips."</p>
      <p>Piers said it was "quite creepy", while co-host Susanna Reid suggested that celebrities shouldn't post pictures if they didn't want "the scrutiny".</p>
