      <p>Eight servicemen were killed in a car bomb explosion in Afghanistan's southern province of Helmand, media reported, citing local sources.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan's Tolo News outlet reported that the explosion took place next to a security checkpoint near the Nad Ali district.</p>
      <p>Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming that 52 soldiers were killed and several others sustained injuries as a result. It also said that clashes ensued after the blast.</p>
      <p>The Afghan government <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201912041077480227-japanese-doctor-killed-in-attack-on-ngo-vehicle-in-afghanistan---reports/">has been engaged in a vicious struggle with the Taliban movement</a> for almost two decades. The conflict-stricken country continues to serve as a breeding ground for various insurgent and militant groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and Daesh* terrorist organisation.</p>
