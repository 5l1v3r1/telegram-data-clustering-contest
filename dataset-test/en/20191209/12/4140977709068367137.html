            <p>With both Desert Gladiators and Flying Oryx beginning the T10 league in titillating style with wins in their opening encounters of the league, today’s match comes bearing with it gigantic ramifications for either unit. For the winners, a win would be of paramount importance, seeing them make early headway into the ongoing edition of the league.<anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137"/></p>
            <p>Playing the league opener against Pearl Gladiators, Flying Oryx couldn’t have transcended on the inaugural edition of the league in more sublime fashion. The 9 wicket win they sealed over their opponents was not only an extremely pleasing to the eye performance but saw them lay down a marker as well, a performance they’ll be looking to reverberate come today as well.</p>

                  <p>Limiting their opposition to just 83 runs, Flying Oryx cruised their way through to a 9 wicket win with almost 3 overs in hand, a clinical pefromance which saw them emerge as one of the most stellar sides in the league. Elsewhere, Desert Gladiators persevered in their run chase as well, a match which saw tem chase down the 94 run target laid out infront of them by Swift Gallopers with 7 wickets and the one over in hand.</p>
                  <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                  <p>The T10 format means that the surface hardly suffers due to the cricket being played on it, rendering the wicket extremely favourable for the batsmen and today will be the same. With it being the first match of the day to be played here, the ball will rise onto the bat extremely nicely, according all the room and time in the world to find the boundary with the side winning the toss set to step out and chase.</p>

                              <h3>DES Vs FLY Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                              <p>We begin with Assad Borham from Flying Oryx for the upcoming tie with the wicket-keeper staying unbeaten on 20 runs in the foregone encounter to see his side cruise their way through to a comfortable win.</p>
                              <p>From the opposition meanwhile we have the one player come in as well in this docket of our side with Adnan Mirza finding representation in our unit after his cantered his way to 23 runs in a mere 13 balls for the side the last time around.</p>
                              <h3>DES Vs FLY Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                              <p>His 49 run off 21 balls saw him not only mar and mull the opposition with his expansive brand of strokeplay being in play but also saw him achieve a comprehensive 7 wicket win for his side to see Muhammad Tanveer become an instant selection for us from the day. Muhammad Ikram comes in as well for us from Desert Gladiators while from the other side of the docket, Jassim Khan in the singular selection we have gone ahead with over here.</p>
                              <h3>DES Vs FLY Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                              <p>His half-century in the league opener was a succulent knock, one which revelled us in an enigmatic brand of extradonaire clean hitting to see us make Hussain Talat from Flying Oryx the first name to be enshrined in this segment of our team. He is accompanied by Harmandeep Singh who not only picked up the one wicket in that encounter but more importantly sent down an electric spell of two overs, one which made it extremely tough for the bats to get under him.</p>
                              <p>Elsewhere, the opposition will have the lone representation over here with us going in Mohammad Hafeez after he stifled the opposition’s batting effort the last time around with the two wickets to his name.</p>
                              <h3>DES Vs FLY Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                              <p>A massive reason for Flying Oryx making for such an ominous bowling unit the last time was down to the tenacious effort of Naveed Malik who returned as the highest wicket taker for his side on the day with the two wickets in his kitty. His counterpart, Musawir Khan will be his partner for the upcoming contest while Awais Malik will represent the opposition.</p>
                              <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                              <p>Hussain comes out to be our unit’s captain while Tanveer is our vice-captain.</p>
