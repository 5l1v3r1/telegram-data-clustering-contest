      <p>Storm Atiyah may now have past, but sub-zero temperatures are expected tonight, more gale force winds are expected tomorrow and later in the week - and more huge waves are set to roll in off the Atlantic on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Exeter-based Met Office says that wind speeds will pick up again tomorrow, with gusts peaking at around 55mph - Gale Force 9 on the Beaufort Scale -  in Devon and Cornwall tomorrow afternoon. </p>
      <p>And the winds will be accompanied by prolonged downpours of heavy rain, from tomorrow morning.</p>
      <p>Tonight temperatures are set to plummet with -1C forecast in some parts of the region.</p>
      <p>While Wednesday is looking a little drier and a little less windy, more prolonged rain and stronger winds will arrive on Thursday, with guts in excess of 60mph expected  on Thursday night/Friday morning down at Land's End, and nearly 50mph in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Friday looks set to stay windy, and wave experts Magic Seaweed forecast  a huge Atlantic swell - which will start arriving on our shores on  Thursday - will reach its crescendo at around 9am on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The Met Office predicts the rains will arrive down at Land's at around 5am on Tuesday morning, sweeping across Cornwall and Devon, pushed by strengthening winds that will peak  at around midday, and early afternoon in Plymouth and Exeter.</p>

      <p>The rain is expected to cross the Tamar at around 8am, arriving in Exeter at around 9am - and will be pretty much persistent until early-to-mid evening.</p>
      <p>Winds are set to off slacken slightly through Wednesday, but spells of heavy rain are expected in the morning at around 9am at Land's End, arriving in Plymouth for lunch time - but petering out before they reach Exeter.</p>
      <p>The Met expects heavy rain to return to Land's in the early hours of  Thursday morning, but clear to showers sunshine by 9am, when the downpours are expected to have reached Plymouth and Exeter.</p>
      <p>Thursday afternoon should bring drier conditions, but steadily rising winds, hitting 65mph by midnight in Land's End and 45mph and 40mph in Plymouth and Exeter respectively.</p>
      <p>While the winds should drop through the day, the Met Office expects it to stay blustery - and the Magic Seaweed predicts huge swells will pound the coastline of Devon and Cornwall for much of the morning.</p>
