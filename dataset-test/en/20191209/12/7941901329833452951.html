      <h1>Former Oracle Product Manager Claims He Was Forced Out For Refusing to Sell Vaporware</h1>

      <p>A former Oracle employee filed a lawsuit against the database giant on Tuesday <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/04/oracle_product_manager_lawsuit/">claiming that he was forced out for refusing to lie</a> about the functionality of the company's software. <i>The <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/12/04/daramola_oracle.pdf">civil complaint</a>, filed on behalf of plaintiff Tayo Daramola in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, contends that Oracle violated whistleblower protections under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, the RICO Act, and the California Labor Code. <br/><br/>According to the court filing, Daramola, a resident of Montreal, Canada, worked for Oracle's NetSuite division from November 30, 2016 through October 13, 2017. He served as a project manager for an Oracle cloud service known as the Cloud Campus BookStore initiative and dealt with US customers. Campus bookstores, along with ad agencies, and apparel companies are among the market segments targeted by Oracle and NetSuite. Daramola's clients are said to have included the University of Washington, the University of Oregon, the University of Texas at Austin, Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California. <br/><br/>The problem, according to the complaint, is that Oracle was asking Daramola to sell vaporware -- a charge the company denies. "Daramola gradually became aware that a large percentage of the major projects to which he was assigned were in 'escalation' status with customers because Oracle had sold his customers software products it could not deliver, and that were not functional," the complaint says. Daramola realized that his job "was to ratify and promote Oracle's repeated misrepresentations to customers" about the capabilities of its software, "under the premise of managing the customer's expectations." The ostensible purpose of stringing customers along in this manner was to buy time so Oracle could actually implement the capabilities it was selling, the court filing states.<br/><br/>As Daramola saw it, his job as project manager thus required him to participate "in a process of affirmative misrepresentation, material omission, and likely fraud."</i> <br/>"We don't agree with the allegations," Oracle told <i>The Register</i> "and intend to vigorously defend the matter."<br/><br/>The article also notes that in 2016 Oracle <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/02/oracle_made_up_cloud_figures_claim/">faced another whistleblower lawsuit</a>, this one brought by a former senior finance manager at Oracle who'd said her bosses directed her to inflate the company's cloud sales. Oracle settled that lawsuit "while denying any wrongdoing."</p>
