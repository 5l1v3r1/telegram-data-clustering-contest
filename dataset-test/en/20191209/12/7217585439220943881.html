      <h1>WhatsApp for Android finally receives a ‘call waiting’ feature</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:00:18+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>WhatsApp for Android now includes a “call waiting” feature that will show users incoming calls during another call, reports <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/whatsapp-for-android-update-call-waiting-support/">91Mobiles</a>.</p>
      <p>This means that you will now be able to see and take calls waiting in your log while you are on a WhatsApp call.</p>
      <p>The feature, which originally released on iOS, is part of WhatsApp’s latest 2.19.357 update on Android.</p>
      <p>Along with call waiting, the update also brings <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/10/whatsapp-group-privacy-blacklist/">group privacy settings</a> and <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/whatsapp-fingerprint-lock-android/">Fingerprint Lock</a> to Android phones as well.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, WhatsApp is also testing a new <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/whatsapp-delete-messages/">“delete messages” feature</a> and its <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/10/whatsapp-dark-mode-themes/">long-awaited dark mode</a> in its latest beta.</p>
