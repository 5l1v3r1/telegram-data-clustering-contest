      <p>Four Katyusha rockets hit a military base near Baghdad International Airport early on Monday, wounding at least six soldiers, Iraqi security officials said. It was the latest incident in a series of rocket attacks in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Iraqi security forces discovered a rocket launcher and some defused rockets nearby after searching the area following the the attack, a statement from <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iraq">Iraqi</a> security forces said.</p>
      <p>According to the security officials, the area targeted by the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/barrage-of-rockets-lands-near-base-hosting-u-s-forces-in-iraq-1.8097314">rockets</a> is frequented by military advisers from the U.S.-led coalition. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.</p>
      <p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>Last Tuesday, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/rockets-hit-base-hosting-u-s-forces-in-western-iraq-1.8220708">five rockets landed inside</a> the Ain al-Asad airbase, a sprawling complex in the western Anbar desert that hosts U.S. forces, without causing any casualties and little damage.</p>
      <p>On at least two occasions last month in Baghdad, rockets landed in areas around the heavily fortified Green Zone, the seat of Iraq's government, causing no casualties or damages.</p>
      <p>And near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, a barrage of Katyusha rockets <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/barrage-of-rockets-lands-near-base-hosting-u-s-forces-in-iraq-1.8097314">targeted an Iraqi air base</a> that houses American troops in early November. No members of the U.S.-led coalition were hurt.</p>

      <p>American forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011 but returned in 2014 at the invitation of the government to help battle the Islamic State group after it seized vast areas in the north and west of the country, including Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city. The U.S.-led coalition provided crucial air support as Iraqi forces regrouped and drove IS out in a costly three-year campaign.</p>
