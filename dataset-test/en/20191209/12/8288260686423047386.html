      <p>A mum said 'all she wants for Christmas is her two front teeth' - after accidentally swallowing her dentures while eating a mince pie.</p>
      <p>Angela McGill, 52, was tucking into the festive snack when she swallowed what she thought was a bit of pastry.</p>
      <p>Gulping hard, she realised that she'd actually swallowed her partial dentures - two teeth attached to a plastic plate - and started panicking.</p>
      <p>The caterer went to hospital and an x-ray revealed the plate was stuck half way down her throat.</p>
      <p>Medics advised any procedure to pull the plate back up her throat would do more good than harm.</p>

      <p>So Angela had to wait 72 hours for her dentures to pass through her digestive system - before she flushed them down the loo.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-three Angela, from Glasgow, is "finding the funny side to this right cock-up" - but has sworn off mince pies forever.</p>
      <p>She laughed: "I just couldnâ€™t believe I'd swallowed my plate - how silly is that?!</p>
      <p>"And I was really enjoying the mince pie too, I just got distracted when someone I work with said my name and I gulped.</p>
      <p>"It was rough, and really hard - I thought it was a tough piece of pastry!</p>
      <p>"Then it went down, and got lodged at the back of my throat, and I thought - 'oh my god, I've swallowed my plate, I've literally lost my teeth!'."</p>

      <p>Angela had her inch-square partial dentures fitted last month to replace 40-year-old caps she had fitted as a girl after an accident.</p>
      <p>"I was swimming when I was about 11 when this boy jumped in the pool, knocked me, and then I clattered my teeth against the edge of the pool," she said.</p>
      <p>"Forty years on, the crowns needed replacing obviously, so they fitted me with two front teeth on this plastic plate instead."</p>
      <p>Unused to her new teeth - which are on her bottom left-side - Angela accidentally swallowed them while eating a mince pie from supermarket Aldi on December 3.</p>

      <p>Angela, a kitchen assistant in healthcare, went to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where medics advised to let the plate pass through her digestive system.</p>
      <p>"When I got to hospital, it got funnier, because they'd said it would do damage to my throat if they tried to pull the plate back up," she said.</p>
      <p>"So they told me to wait three days for the plate to pass through my system.</p>
      <p>"I think I made their day to be honest, maybe even their year! It was ever so funny!"</p>

      <p>Angela then added: "Obviously I wasn't going to be using that plate again - like I say, all I want for Christmas is my two front teeth!"</p>
      <p>She is waiting to get a new set fitted - and hopes she'll get them in time for Christmas.</p>
