      <h1>Dravidian Activists Demand Titan’s Boycott Over Ad Glorifying Tamil-Hindu Culture, Here’s What Happened</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:14:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:14</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>India’s leading watch maker Titan recently launched a marketing campaign glorifying the Tamil-Hindu culture which irked various so-called Dravidian activists who as a result called for their boycott.</p>
      <p>Here is the advertisement in question:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The advertisement contains stunning footage of iconic temples in Tamil Nadu like Darasuram, Brihadeeswara and Kailasanathar.</p>
      <p>The advertisement goes, “Travel around our land, where even stones speak of poetry” as one can see a boy caressing the ancient temple stones and women making flower garlands used in pujas.</p>
      <p>Temples, Kanchi silk and relics of the Tamil-Hindu culture featured prominently in the advertisement which led many to hail Titan for its effort.</p>
      <p>While a sizeable section of social media was praising Titan, a swarm of Dravidian activists descended and began slamming the watchmaker for passing off “Brahminical traditions as Tamil culture”.</p>

      <p>Some social media users claimed that one of the reasons why the aforementioned activists were irked, was a brief newspaper clipping in the advertisement which <a href="https://twitter.com/itispalkova/status/1203633018901917696">reportedly</a> stated, “Rajini will crush Stalin”.</p>
      <p>While the Dravidian activists were lambasting Titan, many social media users came to the watchmaker’s rescue and also promised to buy its products.</p>
