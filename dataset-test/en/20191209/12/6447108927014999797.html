      <details>
        <summary>Gwent Patch 5.0</summary>
        <p>
          <b>Changes</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The music on the Main Menu has been temporarily changed to celebrate the Merchants of Ofir expansion.</li>
          <li>Several audio improvements for voiceovers mastering, including leveling volume and improving leaders voiceovers on vs screen</li>
          <li>Reactable elements react on mouse down rather than mouse up now</li>
          <li>Leaders won’t accidentally walk off the Shipboard during their end game animations</li>
          <li>Only traps with an Order can be manually reversed.</li>
          <li>The following cards can be milled for the full mill value for 3 days: Whispering Hillock,Drummond Warmonger, Pitfall Trap, Serpent Trap, Vrihedd Sappers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>New Features</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introducing gameplay sounds spatialisation. Cards sound effects, voiceovers and ability sounds will now be panned in a way to allow players to track their position.</li>
          <li>New audio design for vanity pickers. Picking a card back, leader or board will be supported with sound effects.</li>
          <li>Selecting a deck to play will now be supported with this deck’s ability sound effect</li>
          <li>Added a button to immediately open a keg that was just purchased/awarded</li>
          <li>Cause of Death propagates its VFX on cards (better visual variety of deaths now)</li>
          <li>Improve UI SFX in shop (keg opening) for revealing a choice of 3 cards</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>New Stratagems are our take on making decks even more customizable. Tactical Advantage is the default Stratagem and it will stay this way, however if players feel like they want an additional inch of personalization, there are 12 new Stratagems to help. They add a bonus layer to deck building and on top of that make matches a little bit more unique.</li>
          <li>The second big addition to this update are Scenarios – Faction specific artifacts that will improve certain areas, that in our opinion, left factions feeling lacking. Albeit risky, they will bring great value to a player’s decks.</li>
