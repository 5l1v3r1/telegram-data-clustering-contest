      <p>If you and your nearest and dearest have been meaning to check out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones-hbo/"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a> but haven't gotten around to it yet (or don't have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/hbo-max-price/">HBO subscription</a>), you can stream the first season for free on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/09/roku-app-apple-watch/">Roku</a> over the holiday season. The monstrously popular series' first 10 episodes will be available at no cost during <a href="https://blog.roku.com/streamathon-announcement">Roku's second annual Stream-a-thon,</a> which runs December 26th to January 1st.</p>
      <p>Over that week, The Roku Channel will also stream the first seasons of <i>Billions, Ray Donovan, The Affair, Warrior</i> and <i>Power </i>for free. Some episodes of <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/19/nicolas-cage-mandy-succession-great-news/">Succession</a>, Barry, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/07/euphoria-hbo-review-teen-tech/">Euphoria</a>, Chernobyl, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/03/sesame-street-hbo-max/">Sesame Street,</a> Kidding, Get Shorty, Pennyworth, Punk, Sonic Christmas Blast, Gumby's Christmas Capers, MXC</i> and <i>Super Mario Bros. Super Show</i> will also be on offer.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Stream-a-thon will have free Hallmark Movies films, along with shows, flicks and documentaries from Smithsonian Channel Plus, Up Faith &amp; Family, The Great Courses Signature, Dove Channel and Pantaya. Some FitFusion workouts will be available at no cost during the event, as will some holiday classics on Stingray Karaoke.</p>
      <p>While Stream-a-thon might give you and your family plenty to watch over the holidays and encourage you to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/02/roku-channel-free-premium-episodes/">check out free stuff on The Roku Channel</a>, Roku is trying to give you a taste of what's on offer via subscriptions to the likes of HBO, Cinemax, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/09/halo-tv-series-production-starts/">Showtime</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/disney-plus-stars-ads-launch/">Starz</a>. To that end, it's offering a new value pack containing HBO and Cinemax for $21/month (they cost $15 and $10 individually), perhaps in case you get hooked on <i>Game of Thrones</i> after that certain thing happens at the end of the first season.</p>
