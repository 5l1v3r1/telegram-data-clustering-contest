        <b>Alex Albon reveals that he was satisfied to take a drive in Formula E last year before receiving the call up to Toro Rosso for the 2019 season. Albon had signed with Nissan to race in the all-electric series in season five, but quickly gave that up when Helmut Marko offered him an F1 chance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And Albon certainly has made the most of that chance, impressing for Toro Rosso before being promoted to Aston Martin Red Bull Racing for the second half of the season, and has been confirmed for 2020 with the frontrunning team.</p>

      <p>The Thai driver had almost given up on his F1 dream until Daniel Ricciardo's move to Renault sent the driver market crazy and left Toro Rosso needing a seat filled.</p>
      <p>According to Crash.net, Albon said:Â <i>"I was happy with Formula E. But I got into Toro Rosso, which was an amazing opportunity.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Six months in, I felt really comfortable with the car and went into the summer break relaxed.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I got a call from the guy [Helmut Marko], a 20-second conversation, to say I was in the big team [Red Bull] now.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"It's worked out really well, still a lot to improve - I know that. But I'm enjoying it."</i>
