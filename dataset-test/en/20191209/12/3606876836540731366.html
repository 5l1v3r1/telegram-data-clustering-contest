        <b>Where is my son? - Jowie Irungu's mother</b>
      </p>
      <p>Anastacia, mother to murder suspect Joseph Irungu alias Jowie, is a worried woman after his son was moved from Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Anastacia revealed that she went to Kamiti to visit him on Monday and was informed that he had been moved to Manyani Maximum Security Prison in Taita Taveta.</p>
      <p>She further raised concerns that she could not ascertain if he was unharmed since she was not allowed to see him before he was moved.</p>

        <p><i>"It's like they want to do something to him. The prison officer says it's a normal transfer but our lawyer says he has never heard of something like that,"</i> she stated.</p>
        <p>Anastacia told reporters that she could not be certain that Jowie had been transported to Manyani, saying that she would make the trip to find her son.</p>
