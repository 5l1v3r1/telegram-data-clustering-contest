      <p>The fast-growing city of Surrey is getting a second hospital.</p>
      <p>Premier John Horgan and Health Minister Adrian Dix made the announcement near the location of the new hospital in the community of Cloverdale.</p>
      <p>Dix says the hospital is a key commitment to help meet the health care needs of Surrey's rapidly growing community.</p>
      <p>The government says the hospital will have inpatient beds, an emergency department, operating rooms, outpatient services, and lab and diagnostic services.</p>
      <p>It says the business plan phase of the project will now get underway to finalize details of the project's scope and budget.</p>
      <p>Surrey is the second-largest city in B.C. and is on track to overtake Vancouver as the most populous city by 2041.</p>
