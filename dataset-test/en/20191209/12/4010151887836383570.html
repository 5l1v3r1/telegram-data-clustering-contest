      <p>Dec. 9, 2019 -- Even moderate <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts">alcohol</a> drinking may increase <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm">cancer</a> risk, according to a new study.</p>
      <p>It included more than 63,000 cancer patients in Japan who were compared with an equal number of healthy people, <i>The New York Times</i> reported.</p>
      <p>After controlling for factors such as <a href="https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/quit-smoking">smoking</a>, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/am-i-obese">obesity</a>, the researchers concluded that drinking the equivalent of 6 ounces of wine, 17 ounces of beer or 2 ounces of whiskey a day for 10 years increased the relative risk of cancer by 5%, according to the study published in the journal <i>Cancer</i>.</p>
      <p>Compared to nondrinkers, people who had two drinks a day for 40 years had a 54% higher risk of cancer, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The links between drinking and cancer were particularly strong for cancers of the mouth, throat, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-stomach">stomach</a> and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-colon">colon</a>.</p>
