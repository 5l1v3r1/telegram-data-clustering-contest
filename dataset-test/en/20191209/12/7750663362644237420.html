      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo 'regrets leaving Real Madrid'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cristiano-ronaldo/"><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b></a> has allegedly told a number of his former <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> teammates that he regrets leaving for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> in 2018.</h2>

      <p>After a hugely-successful nine-year stint at the Bernabeu, Ronaldo made the decision to take on a new challenge at the Serie A champions, penning a four-year contract in the process.</p>
      <p>However, having missed out on the Ballon d'Or for two successive seasons, <i>ABC</i> claims that the Portuguese superstar now wishes that he had remained in Spain.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that the 34-year-old has expressed his disappointment at missing out on the top individual accolade to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luka-modric/"><b>Luka Modric</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-messi/"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a> respectively.</p>
      <p>While Ronaldo has still scored 37 times from 61 appearances for Juve, the veteran has been unable to replicate the same form that he produced for Madrid.</p>
