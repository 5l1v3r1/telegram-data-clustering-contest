      <p>Wales will start their Euro 2020 preparations with a home fixture against Austria on March 27.</p>
      <p>The venue will be decided at a later date as Austria return to Wales for the first time since losing a World Cup qualifier 1-0 in Cardiff in September 2017.</p>
      <p>“The Football Association of Wales is pleased to announce that the men’s national team will play an international friendly against Austria on Friday, 27 March 2020,” said an FAW statement.</p>

      <p>“This will be Cymru’s first preparation match of the year ahead of the Euro 2020 finals in June where they will face Switzerland, Turkey and Italy in Group A.”</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs’ side booked their place at Euro 2020 – only Wales’ third major tournament in their history – by winning back-to-back games against Azerbaijan and Hungary last month to finish second behind Croatia in their qualifying group.</p>
      <p>An FAW delegation is currently in Azerbaijan, where Wales will meet Switzerland and Turkey in their first two games of Euro 2020 before they play Italy in Rome.</p>
