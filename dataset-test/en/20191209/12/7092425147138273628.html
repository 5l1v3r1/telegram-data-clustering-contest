          <b>Kerry Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae was taken to hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation after a fire broke out in his office and shop this morning.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident occurred at 9am at the politician's Kilgarvan property, which houses Mr Healy-Rae's post office and sorting office as well as his constituency office and shop, according to <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/munster/2019/1209/1097951-healy-rae-fire/"><b><i>RTE</i></b></a>.</p>
      <p>It's believed the fire broke out around the fuse board of the filling station in Kilgarvan this morning and Healy-Rae extinguished the blaze himself during which he was exposed to smoke.</p>
      <p>He was taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution due to the potential effects of smoke inhalation.</p>
      <p>Gardaí are not treating the fire as suspicious and say all early indications are that it was accidental.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Radio Kerr, Danny Healy-Rae said his brother is fine after this morning's incident but was hospitalised as a precaution.</p>
      <p>"Michael put out the fire and as a result he has inhaled a bit of smoke," Danny said, via <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/michael-healy-rae-treated-for-smoke-inhalation-after-fire-in-office-969302.html"><b><i>Breaking News</i></b></a>.</p>
      <p>"He's fine, but it was decided that he should go for an x-ray to check himself out.</p>
      <p>"It's a shock because it was a bit scary for a few minutes until it was brought under control."</p>
