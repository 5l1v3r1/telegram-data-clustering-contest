      <p>The internet has of late been in a frenzy over a weird object hovering above the small California town of Menifee. Footage that first emerged on YouTube on 3 December, despite originally being shot on 19 October, sported a vast amount of lights, with the glow leading viewers to think it could be a drone lurking in the clouds.</p>

      <blockquote>The assumption, however, was instantly dismissed taking into account the above average height it flew at, equal to “2,000ft in the air”.</blockquote>
      <p>On top of that, the object seemed to be silent, stuck on the horizon without changing its position, making conspiracy theorists likewise rule out skydivers.</p>
      <p>In the caption to the video, the uploader claims the object, which many deemed to be some stealth craft, had seen by “over 100 witnesses".</p>
      <blockquote>“Whatever it is it's Not a CGI hoax. Difficult to tell if All the lights are connected to one object", another suggested.</blockquote>
      <p>“At one point, the huge UFO was just hovering in the same spot for over five minutes before it speeds off into the night sky", uploader UFOS &amp; Aliens Santana wrote, while another suggested that if so, “then that is impressive footage".</p>
      <p>Users appear to be taking the perfectly realistic craft video seriously:</p>
      <p>“I’m sharing this!.. Ufo activity is increasing so fast! The world is gonna get a big wake up call!” one exclaimed, whereas a second left some room for a bit of irony:</p>
      <blockquote>“Another floating broken light bulb that needs to be replaced! New ladder almost ready! Lol”</blockquote>
