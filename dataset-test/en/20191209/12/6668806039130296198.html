      <p>The film industry has continued to render its support to the Me Too Movement ever since it started over a year ago. While the movement has been around longer, it impacted the Indian film industry only a while back. Talking about how the West influenced victims to speak up, superstar Shah Rukh Khan shared his thoughts over the movement and its impact.

      <p>Shah Rukh further explained the magnitude of this movement and said, “The greatness of this movement is that in the future, we have to accept that people do mistreat women in most fields than not, it has been a conversation everywhere.”<br/><br/>Talking about how it has changed the way people take actions in the industry, SRK said, “In the cinematic world and media world it has made us a little more aware now. I think the main thing is that people are aware that this is not going to go untouched if somebody behaves in an improper manner. ”</p>

      <p>Khan also emphasized on what his idea of respecting women is and how he has imbibed the same into his son Aryan, “I teach my 21 year old son that disrespecting a person is not okay, and I don’t mean beating or the kind of things that #MeToo has brought out. I’m talking about basic respect. I’ve been married for 30 years I’ve never looked into my wife’s purse. I still knock on the bedroom door if she’s changing; I knock on my daughter’s bedroom door. They know it’s me, but this is their space.”</p>
