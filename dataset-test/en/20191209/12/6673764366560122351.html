      <p><b>STOCKHOLM – </b>Japanese chemist Akira Yoshino, one of three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in chemistry for contributions to the development of lithium-ion batteries, said in his Nobel lecture on Sunday that such batteries will play a key role in achieving a sustainable society.</p>
      <p>Lithium-ion batteries “will play a central role” in achieving a sustainable society in which the environment, economy and convenience are balanced in harmony, the 71-year-old honorary fellow at Asahi Kasei Corp. and professor at Meijo University said at Stockholm University in Sweden. “Our world will change dramatically.”</p>
      <p>In the lecture, titled “Brief History and Future of Lithium-ion Batteries,” Yoshino underscored that the development of the batteries can be linked with that of AI, the “internet of things” and next-generation wireless networks.</p>
      <p>Behind the discovery of a key electrode material were research results achieved by two other Japanese Nobel laureates — the late Kenichi Fukui and University of Tsukuba professor emeritus Hideki Shirakawa, 83, Yoshino said.</p>
      <p>Lithium-ion batteries are “very, very fortunate fellows,” born with the support of eight Nobel laureates, Yoshino said.</p>

      <p>Regarding a reason for selection of the lithium-ion battery researchers for this year’s prize, Yoshino cited expectations for the batteries’ contributions to efforts to build a sustainable society.</p>
      <p>“Innovation all around will enable a sustainable society to be achieved very soon,” Yoshino said.</p>
      <p>The clash between environmental protection and the pursuit of economy and convenience can be resolved, he said, expressing confidence about the role lithium-ion batteries will play.</p>
      <p>Among his best decisions in life, he cited his advance to Kyoto University and his marriage to his wife, Kumiko, 71. Yoshino drew laughter when he described her as a “wonderful woman.”</p>
      <p>When he finished the lecture he received thunderous applause, and shook hands with John Goodenough, an American and one of the three co-winners of this year’s prize, who attended Yoshino’s lecture in a wheelchair.</p>
      <p>The lecture is one of a series of events during Nobel Week, including a news conference with other laureates Saturday and the awards ceremony on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Yoshino, who was born in Osaka Prefecture, shared the award with Goodenough and Stanley Whittingham of the U.K.</p>
