      <p>The dead man has been identified as 21-year-old Sayem Hasan Shanto, who stopped pursuing his education after completing his HSC. He was arrested on charges of kidnapping a girl and later released from prison on Friday.</p>
      <p>Sayem used to live with his parents in their 7th floor flat at a seven-storied building, OC Kazi told bdnews24.com. He committed suicide by strangling himself in his room.</p>
      <p>“A suicide note has been found in the room. The note holds the parents of the girl responsible for his death.”</p>
      <p>A few days back Sayem lured a 10th grader to his house, said Kazi. The girl’s father started a kidnapping case against Sayem with Kotwali police station over the incident.</p>
      <p>A case has been filed in the incident, said Kazi.</p>
      <p>The body has been sent to Sir Salimullah Medical College morgue for autopsy.</p>
