      <p>Pitso Mosimane has revealed his assessment of their 0-0 draw against Wydad Casablanca, saying that a game of that quality was worthy of goals.</p>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns went to the top of their CAF Champions League group standings after securing a point in Morocco on the weekend, putting to bed their record of losing away to the North Africans.</p>

      <p>“Like I mentioned yesterday ahead of the match, the game played out as we expected. Games between us (Wydad Casablanca &amp; Mamelodi Sundowns) are always like this,” Mosimane said on Sundowns’ official website.</p>
      <p>“A beautiful game like this deserves goals. I would have accepted a 1–1 draw or a 2–2 draw. Home and away goals don’t matter in the group stages. </p>
      <p>“We started better. It was a game of two halves; the first half belonged to Sundowns and the second half to Wydad. In the last 15 minutes Wydad put us under pressure. But we defended well, with clean tackles. Overall it was a good game, Wydad is a great team and we respect them always,” the Sundowns head coach added.  </p>
