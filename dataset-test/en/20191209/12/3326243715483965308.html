      <h3>1. Get words as you type</h3>
      <p>Whether you’re composing an email or writing up a note, you might be unsure how to spell a word. Rather than use a dictionary, just use a keyboard shortcut <b>F5</b>. This will show you words starting with the letters you’ve typed so far. Then you can just select the word you want and keep writing.</p>

        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/F5-word-list-shortcut-on-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>2. Spotlight Search for quick calculations</h3>
      <p>You don’t have to open the Calculator to do calculations. For simple equations, you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/09/12/finder-search-tips-mac/">using Spotlight Search</a>. Just open the Search and pop in the calculation you want.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Spotlight-Search-calculation-on-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>3. Force quit window</h3>
      <p>If you’re used to using Control + Alt + Delete on Windows to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/06/01/quit-apps-mac/">force quit an application</a>, you’ll need to get used to a different shortcut on macOS. Hit <b>Command</b> + <b>Option</b> + <b>Escape</b> to open the force quit window.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Force-quit-app-window-on-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>4. Delete files quickly</h3>
      <p>Another cool shortcut you can use on Mac is to delete files. Instead of dragging them to the Trash or using the right-click shortcut menu, just select the item and hit <b>Command</b> + <b>Delete</b>.</p>
      <h3>5. Screenshot the entire screen</h3>
      <p>Mac has a cool tool for <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/07/13/howto-take-screenshots-mac-mojave/">capturing your screen</a> that you can access with Command + Shift + 5. But for a fast screenshot of your entire screen, just use <b>Command</b> + <b>Shift</b> + <b>3</b>.</p>
      <h3>6. Open apps on startup</h3>
      <p>If you start each day by opening the same apps on your Mac, you can make this much easier. Set up your Mac so that the same apps open automatically when you start your computer.</p>
      <p>Open <b>System Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Users &amp; Groups</b>. Select your username and click <b>Login Items</b> at the top. You can then check the boxes for those apps in the list or add more using the <b>plus sign</b> button.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Login-Items-setting-on-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>7. Accents on letters</h3>
      <p>If you need to use a letter that has an accent, you don’t have to search for a special character. Just press and hold the key on your keyboard. A selection of accented letters based on that key will display for you to pick the one you want.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Letter-accents-in-Notes-on-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>8. Access the emojis</h3>
      <p>You have a really cool collection of emojis along with special characters on your Mac. And without jumping through hoops, you can open them with a keyboard shortcut. Press <b>Control</b> + <b>Command</b> + <b>Space</b> and the window will pop open.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emojis-window-on-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>9. Show and hide the menu bar</h3>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/19/learn-mac-menu-bar-basics/">the menu bar is handy</a> for navigation, there may be a time when it gets in your way. Luckily there’s a simple way to keep it hidden when you don’t need it.</p>
      <p>Open <b>System Preferences</b> &gt; <b>General</b>. Towards the top, check the box for <b>Automatically hide and show the menu bar</b>. You should immediately see your menu bar vanish. To show it again, just move your cursor to the top of the screen.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Show-hide-menu-bar-setting-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>10. Change volume in smaller increments</h3>
      <p>You can easily increase or decrease the volume on your Mac using Fn with the volume buttons. But if you want to change the volume in smaller increments, hold <b>Shift</b> + <b>Option</b> with Fn and the volume buttons. You’ll see the indicators for the volume move in smaller amounts.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Change-volume-small-increments-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>11. Delete forward</h3>
      <p>If you’re switching from a Windows computer, then you’re used to having both Delete and Backspace keys on your keyboard. Delete removes letters forward and Backspace removes letters backward.</p>
      <p>But on Mac, you only have Delete, which works like Backspace removing letters backwards. So if you want to remove letters forward, use the keyboard shortcut <b>Fn</b> + <b>Delete</b>.</p>
      <h3>12. Merge Finder windows</h3>
      <p>While you can use tabs in Finder to view multiple windows, you might open new ones without thinking to use tabs. But you can easily clear up the clutter by merging your open Finder windows.</p>
      <p>With them all open and active, click <b>Window</b> &gt; <b>Merge All Windows</b> from the menu bar. You’ll then see all of your open Finder windows combined into one using tabs for each.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Merge-Finder-windows-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>13. Batch rename files</h3>
      <p>You can easily rename files one by one, but if you want to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/10/18/how-to-batch-rename-files-in-os-x-yosemite/">rename a group of files</a> to something similar, there’s a fast way to do it. Select the files you want to rename, right-click, and choose <b>Rename X Items</b>. You’ll get a pop-up window where you can replace the text in the current filenames with whatever you like.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Batch-rename-files-Mac.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>14. Use Split View</h3>
      <p>Create more workspace on your Mac by using <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/07/29/how-to-use-split-view-on-mac/">the Split View feature</a>. This lets you put two apps side-by-side in a full-screen view.</p>
      <p>Put your cursor over the green button on the top left of the first app’s window. You can then choose to put that window on the left or right of the screen. Once you do, you’ll see which windows are available to use on the other side of the screen. Just click the one you want and you’ll be in Split View.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>15. Move your Dock to another screen</h3>
      <p>If you work with a dual monitor setup, you can put your Dock on whichever screen you want. The Dock will move automatically to your active window.</p>
      <p>Go to the second screen and click to make it the active one, then move your cursor to where your Dock would be (bottom, left, or right). Your Dock will pop right up on that other screen.</p>
