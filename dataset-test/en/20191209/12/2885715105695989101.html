      <p>Traditional wear always looks graceful and is always in vogue. Whether it is a brunch with friends or a day at work, you can always fall back on that kurta in your wardrobe and pair it with either denims or a pair of palazzos. From college students to Bollywood celebs, everybody swears by ethnic. So it is no surprise that they form an essential part of Karisma Kapoor’s wardrobe too!</p>
      <p>Check out how the<i> Biwi No 1</i> actor nails the suit look every time she steps out in one.</p>

      <p>The actor looks like a vision in this gorgeous Anarkali suit by designer Varun Bahl. We like how she keeps the overall look basic by teaming the ensemble with a pair of silver jhumkis from Azotiique. Styled by Eshaa Amiin, the actor opted for basic make-up with a hint of pink on her lips, and hair tied up in a ponytail. A silver potli completed the look.</p>

      <p>Kapoor looks lovely in this ethnic ensemble from Ekaya, which comprises of an off-white printed anarkali and a bright purple dupatta with golden prints. We love the colour combination, and how she teamed it with a pair of golden chandbalis. Simple makeup with pink lips, kohl-rimmed eyes and a little bindi rounded out the look.</p>

      <p>Looks like the actor loves white, and we aren’t complaining. After all, she pulls it off so effortlessly. We love her in this Surily G ensemble, which was accessorised with a pair of classic aviators, an embroided potli and embellished juttis.</p>

      <p>Letting her golden brocade kurta do all the talking, Kapoor keeps it simple with blue pants and sequined juttis. Bright pink lips and a pair of basic golden earrings complete the look.</p>

      <p>She looks pretty as a picture in this V-neck magenta kurta which was paired with a white Patiala salwar with  golden prints from Payal Pratap. Styled by Eshaa Amiin, she completed her look with loose hair, pink lips and a golden necklace which looks as if it was just meant for this ensemble.</p>
