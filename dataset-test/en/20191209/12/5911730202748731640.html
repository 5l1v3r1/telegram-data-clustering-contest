      <h1>Russia banned from 2020 Olympics, 2022 World Cup over doping scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:02:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">CNN Newsource</a></address>
      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has unanimously agreed to ban Russia from major international sporting competitions -- notably the Olympics and the World Cup -- for four years over doping non-compliance.</p>
      <p>WADA's compliance review committee (CRC) had suggested several sanctions because of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency's (RUSADA) failure to cooperate fully during probes into Russian sport.</p>
      <p>WADA's executive committee decided to uphold the recommendations at a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on Monday.</p>
      <p>RUSADA now has 21 days to accept the decision or send the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p>
      <p>If upheld, the decision means Russia will be unable to compete in next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo nor the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why the ban?</b>
      </p>
      <p>WADA's punishment relates to inconsistencies in data retrieved by WADA in January 2019 from the Moscow lab at the center of the 2016 McLaren report, which uncovered a widespread and sophisticated state-sponsored sports doping network.</p>
      <p>RUSADA was initially deemed non-compliant after the publication of the McLaren report in 2016.</p>
      <p>Commissioned by WADA, the report found the Russian state conspired with athletes and sporting officials to undertake a doping program that was unprecedented in its scale and ambition.</p>
      <p>The findings led to sanctions, including no Russian team being present at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, with certain eligible athletes being forced to compete under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>The latest ban leaves the door open for Russian athletes, who can prove they are not tainted by the scandal, to compete as neutral athletes.</p>
