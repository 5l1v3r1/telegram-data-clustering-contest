        <b>A Christmas tree that was chopped down outside the BBC's Broadcasting House this weekend "will be replaced soon", the corporation has said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 7m (20ft) tree was put up outside the building in central London on 30 November.</p>
      <p>However, staff pictured the tree being destroyed by maintenance workers on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A BBC spokesman said the tree had been removed "due to activity on the piazza" in the week of the general election.</p>

      <p>Alice Bortolotto, 31, who manages nearby coffee house Caff√® Nero said it was "sad" the tree had gone.</p>
      <p>"We love to see the tree every year when they put it up," she said.</p>
      <p>"On Saturday, when I came in and didn't see it, I felt a bit like, 'Where's Christmas gone?'"</p>
      <p>BBC Africa editor Will Ross posted a picture of the tree being chopped up, suggesting the tree "has had a traumatic day at the barbers".</p>
