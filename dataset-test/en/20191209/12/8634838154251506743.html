        <b>Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, on Monday, December 9, addressed the alleged news regarding his appointment of Simon Mbugua as his deputy governor.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/"><i>Kenyans.co.ke</i></a>  through his Director of Communications, Jakob Elkanah, the governor categorically classified the news as fake.</p>
      <p>He went on to urge Kenyans to ignore the memo doing the rounds on social media, adding that any <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/47472-sonko-trolls-police-impassioned-message-supporters">communication from the governor's office would come through the official channels.</a></p>
      <p>The fake statement dated December 9, 2019, complete with City Hall's insignia, had mentioned Simon Mbugua as Sonko's choice for deputy governor.</p>

      <p>"To ensure that residents are not denied service and sound leadership, I hereby nominate Hon. Simon Mbugua as the Deputy Governor of Nairobi," read the statement in part.</p>
      <p>The fake letter also indicated that Sonko had decided to step aside from office, a fact he has also denied.</p>
      <p>Sonko <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/47469-sonkos-arrest-drama-takes-new-twist">was arrested in dramatic fashion in Voi </a>on Friday, December 6, and faces over 13 counts of conflict of interest and corruption allegations.</p>
      <p>He was arraigned at the Milimani Law Courts on Monday, December 9, <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/47480-sonkos-unveils-expensive-strategy-beat-dpp-haji">where he quickly went about displaying his resolve to fight it out against his accusers</a>, by hiring a team of 12 lawyers reportedly led by Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen.</p>
      <p>The governor stands accused of misappropriating over Ksh357 million together with other county officials.</p>
