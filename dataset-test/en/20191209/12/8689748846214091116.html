      <p>US rapper Cardi B is still the hottest commodity on our part of the social media landscape after the drama which preceded her energetic performance last night at the Accra Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Bodak Yellow hit maker admitted she watched porn movies during her stay in Nigeria in an interview on Nigeria-based Cool FM.</p>
      <p>Cardi B, who was interviewed by media personalities, N6 and Taymi, described Nigerians as “great entertainers”.</p>
      <p>She proceeded to talk about Davido, Burna Boy and her love for the country.</p>
      <p>As we all know, some Ghanaian celebrities are ‘bleeding’ after Cardi B refused (well it turned out that it wasn’t deliberate as she had no idea a formality like that has been arranged) to meet them in a Meet and Greet session at the Kempinski Hotel in Accra.</p>
