      <p>He said despite the conviction, Mr Kalu remains a sitting senator and will be paid all of his entitlements in full, <i>Premium Times </i>reports.</p>
      <p>He said until the case gets to Surpeme Court and a final judgement is given, Mr Kalu remains a serving lawmaker.</p>
      <blockquote>“He is still a senator. This is the first court. The matter is going to Supreme Court so, he still has the opportunity to appeal up to the Supreme Court level.<br/><br/>“Of course they will pay him. Because he is a sitting senator just like I said…if you file for appeal, you are still serving and so they will pay you.<br/><br/>“All his entitlements will be paid. There is no cause for alarm. In fact, even if Court of Appeal says they have upheld the judgement of the lower court, he still has the right to go to Supreme Court. So once the Supreme Court says, yes, the judgement is okay, then that’s the final,” he explained.</blockquote>

      <p>Earlier, Mr Akwashiki said Mr Kalu’s seat will not be declared vacant.</p>
      <p>He explained that no provision in the constitution that says the seat of any senator facing prosecution or convicted at a lower court should be declared vacant.</p>
