      <h1>Kieran Tierney's Arsenal absence explained as former Celtic star suffers blow</h1>
      <h2>The left back has been left out by Freddie Ljungberg but it isn't down to his quality.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:48:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal fans have been baffled at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney's</a> absence from the starting XI under Freddie Ljungberg.</p>
      <p>The former Celtic star made an 18 minute appearance from the bench in the 2-1 defeat to Brighton last Thursday.</p>
      <p>He's likely to be on the bench again on Monday night for the clash with West Ham but some <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans feared that Ljungberg just didn't fancy him ahead of Sead Kolasinic.</p>
      <p>However, it's being reported that it is actually down to a slight injury that Tierney has been left out.</p>
      <p>The left back hasn't had his issues to seek in recent seasons and missed a large part of the start of the season with his hip problem.</p>

      <p>The latest isn't anything to do with his past injuries though and that is good news in a sense.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1440713/2019/12/09/ornstein-on-monday-city-planning-for-life-after-pep-koscielny-and-ozils-goodbyes-to-emery-and-contract-talks-for-leicesters-maddison-and-soyuncu/">The Athletic,</a> the delay in bringing Tierney in as first choice left back has been down to a shoulder problem as well as his hip injury.</p>
      <p>Tierney has made just 10 appearances since his Â£25m summer switch from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-park">Celtic Park</a> but has completed 90 minutes in just five of them.</p>
      <p>His last start came in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> defeat to Frankfurt, a game which proved to be Unai Emery's last in charge.</p>
