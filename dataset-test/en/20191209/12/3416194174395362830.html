      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/jenna-ortega/"><b>Jenna Ortega</b></a> scrolls through her phone in this brand new promo for <b><i>You</i></b>.</p>
      <p>In the series, the 16-year-old actress plays Ellie, teenager who isn’t afraid to do her own scheming.</p>
      <p>If you don’t know, the first season of You centered on Joe Goldberg (<a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/penn-badgley/"><b>Penn Badgley</b></a>), an anti-social bookstore manager with a dark side.</p>
      <p>However, in season two, Joe, who now goes by Will, is on the other side of the country in LA and surrounded by screenwriters, influencers, and everyone that’s “pretending to be someone they’re not.”</p>
      <p>Check out the ominous promo below and catch <i>You </i>season two on Netflix, premiering on Thursday, December 26th!</p>
