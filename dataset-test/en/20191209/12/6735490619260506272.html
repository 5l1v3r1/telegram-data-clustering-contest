      <p>Looking stunning on the January 2020 cover with her daughter Kulture, the “I Like It” performer gets candid with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/cardi-b-cover-january-2020">the magazine</a> about motherhood and her relationship with Offset following his cheating scandal.</p>
      <p>“When me and my husband got into our issues…you know, he cheated and everything and I decided to stay with him and work together with him, a lot of people were so mad at me; a lot of women felt disappointed in me,” she says.</p>
      <p>“But it’s real-life sh**. If you love somebody and you stop being with them, and you’re depressed and social media is telling you not to talk to that person because he cheated, you’re not really happy on the inside until you have the conversation,” Cardi adds.</p>
      <p>“Then, if you get back with them, it’s like, ‘How could you? You let all of us down.’”</p>

      <p>Through thick and thin, the rapper admits that she and Offset are still working on their issues.</p>
      <p>“I believe in forgiveness. I prayed on it. Me and my husband, we prayed on it. We had priests come to us,” the 27-year-old reveals.</p>
      <p>“We just came to an understanding like, bro, it’s really us against the world. He has my back for everything, I have his back for everything, so when you cheat, you’re betraying the person that has your back the most,” Cardi continues.</p>
      <p>“Why would you do that? We have come to a clear understanding. For me, monogamy is the only way. I’ll beat your a** if you cheat on me.”</p>

      <p>Along with their relationship, the musical couple are also still trying to figure out how to settle into family life together with their one-year-old daughter, Kulture.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Offset added: “It’s not an easy thing. We both have our own households.”</p>
      <p>“But you grow. We’re way better now with communication. She’s balancing a lot. She feels like she can’t be absent a lot, and our jobs are crazy.”</p>
      <p>“I think motherhood got her more focused. I always tell her, don’t follow the comments. But she’s been outspoken on things since before she was making music, she’s not ever putting on, she’s not ever being cool. At the end of the day, she’s still going to rap about the same sh**, which is what it’s like being a woman,” Offset adds.</p>

      <p>When it comes to motherhood, Cardi shares that “things are a little bit hard to balance.”</p>
      <p>“It’s good for the mental. Like, if I’m playing with my daughter, I forget about the issues,” she says.</p>
