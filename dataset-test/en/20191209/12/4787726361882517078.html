      <h3>LANDR releases a free sample pack inspired by the Pantone Colour Of The Year</h3>
      <p>
        <b>What does ‘Classic Blue’ sound like? We’ve got no idea, but auto-mastering maven LANDR has attempted to answer the question by releasing a free sample pack inspired by this hue, which just so happens to be the Pantone Colour Of The Year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Created in collaboration with Pantone and New York audio branding agency Audio UX, the pack is designed to serve as a “multisensory experience” in support of said colour. </p>
      <p>Classic Blue, we’re told, is: “A timeless and enduring blue hue elegant in its simplicity. Suggestive of the sky at dusk, the reassuring qualities of Classic Blue offers the promise of protection; highlighting our desire for a dependable and stable foundation from which to build as we cross the threshold into a new era.</p>
      <p>“Imprinted in our psyches as a restful color, Classic Blue brings a sense of peace and tranquility to the human spirit, instilling calm and confidence and offering refuge. Stimulating us to look beyond the obvious, PANTONE 19-4052 Classic Blue encourages us to expand our thinking; challenging us to think more deeply, increase our perspective and open the flow of communication.”</p>
      <p>Gotcha. Whether all of that strikes a chord with you or not, you might still fancy downloading the samples, of which there are 145. Check out the Pantone pack on the <a href="https://samples.landr.com/packs/pantone-classic-blue-sample-pack"><u>LANDR</u></a> website.</p>
