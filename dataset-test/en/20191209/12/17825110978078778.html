      <p>Cape Town - The Khayelitsha Development Forum (KDF) has appointed its former chairperson Michael Benu to lead a task team to look into the state of public transport in Khayelitsha.</p>
      <p>Residents of the area have been without trains for at least 35 days, and without MyCiTi buses for more than six months.</p>
      <p>KDF chairperson Ndithini Tyhido said the task team would examine, among other things, the train services to the area; the impact on commuters of the impasse between the Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) and the City over the MyCiTi bus service; as well as issues of general safety on public transportation in the area.</p>
      <p>“The task team’s mandate is to mobilise the community to fight and maintain reliable public transportation services in the area.</p>
      <p>“They will engage with all three tiers of government and the other affected stakeholders,” he said.</p>
