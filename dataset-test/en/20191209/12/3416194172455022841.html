      <p>If you watched the first part of <i>Crisis of Infinite Earths</i> last night, you saw that Mia Smoak has a brand new suit and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/katherine-mcnamara/"><b>Katherine McNamara</b></a> is showing it off.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old actress took to social media so share the details of her new look with fans.</p>
      <p>“New hood. Who dis? Thanks Dad for the new duds! @stephenamell,” <b>Katherine </b>captioned.</p>
      <p>She also shared another behind-the-scenes pic from the set, of her “kat-napping”: “I don’t know about you but I’m floored after that episode! ;) PS – yes that’s me…Kat-napping… at 4am…on a break on set… they couldn’t find me. They thought I was a mannequin…. yup.”</p>
      <p><b>Katherine </b>also spoke to <a href="https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/12/09/crisis-on-infinite-earths-spoilers-part-1-oliver-queen-mia-smoak-costume/">ComicBook.com</a> about the responsibility of donning the iconic green threads as the Green Arrow.</p>
      <p>“It’s a responsibility — and it’s one that I don’t take lightly, but it’s one that I’m very excited to get to carry a little bit,” she shared. “Working with Stephen, this season, has been so wonderful because I’ve gotten to watch him do just that and I’ve gotten to watch how he handled this responsibility and this legacy. And it’s been great to follow in his footsteps, in a sense.”</p>
