        <b>EX-CELTIC ace Stephen Crainey has accused Rangers of a lack of sportsmanship during yesterday's Betfred Cup Final.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> left-back - now Fleetwood Town’s U-23 coach - took a swipe at Steven Gerrard’s <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5044001/rangers-celtic-mccoist-morelos-penalty/">Light Blues</a> over a controversial second-half incident.</p>

      <p>Celts kicked the ball out of play after an injury to match winner Christopher Jullien, who hit the deck when Alfredo Morelos raked his studs down his achilles.</p>
      <p>But Gers refused to give it back to their Old Firm rivals, leaving Neil Lennon’s Hoops stars fuming.</p>
      <p>Crainey also reckoned the Rangers players should have applauded Celts as they climbed the steps at Hampden to lift the trophy.</p>
      <p>Writing on Twitter after his former club’s <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5043540/rangers-0-celtic-1-betfred-cup-final/">1-0 victory</a>, he said: “Sportsmanship right out the window today, not giving ball back and not staying to clap!!</p>
      <p>“Based on that alone @CelticFC deserved to win, Boooom 👊🏻🍀🏆.”</p>
      <p>We told earlier how Scott Brown and Scott Arfield exchanged words during the pre-match handshakes as the mind games got off to an early start.</p>

      <p>BT Sport cameras captured the needle, with the Hoops captain responding to a comment from his midfield rival.</p>
      <p>Gers had several chances to win the match but Hoops goalie Fraser Forster turned in a man-of-the-match display, denying Morelos on several occasions.</p>
      <p>And the Colombian international also watched his second-half penalty saved by the on-loan Southampton star.</p>
      <p>Rangers legend <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5044001/rangers-celtic-mccoist-morelos-penalty/">Ally McCoist later claimed Morelos didn’t think he would score</a> from the spot.</p>

      <p>BT Sport pundit Coisty - the club’s all-time record goalscorer - said: “That split second before he [Morelos] hits it, you can see he just doesn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>“I was sitting here ready to have a go [at Tavernier], but as soon as Steven Gerrard said he was the designated penalty taker, you’ve got to back off and respect that.”</p>
      <p>After the game, Gerrard insisted Jullien’s winner shouldn’t have counted as a trio of Celtic stars were offside.</p>
      <p>He said: “There were three Celtic players standing in offside positions but unfortunately we play in a country where there is no VAR.</p>
      <p>“Look, I’m not going to sit here and make excuses. I’m not the type of person who blames or look for excuses.</p>
      <p>“The big moments have gone against us today, we are all responsible for that.</p>
      <p>“But the reality is, at the top end of football, you expect the linesman to get one of them right from the three who were in an offside position.”</p>
      <p>Asked if VAR should be introduced into Scottish football, Gerrard added: “I think it has taken something away from the game, so I’d be a liar if I said I’m 100 percent in favour of it.</p>
      <p>“But one thing I do know is that the officials up here do need some support and help.</p>
      <p>“Because there are too many things, not just for our club but across the board, that they maybe miss and need a bit of support on.”</p>
