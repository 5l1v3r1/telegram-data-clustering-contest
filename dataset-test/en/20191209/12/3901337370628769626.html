      <p>Takefusa Kubo, 18, lined up for Mallorca in their 5-2 LaLiga defeat to the Catalan giants on Saturday, just a few months after signing for rivals Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>The Japan international was forced to leave Barca due to a FIFA sanction, as the club had breached rules in securing his signature.</p>

      <p>"That's the decision of the fans," he said, according to <i>Onefootball</i>.</p>
      <p>"I made my call and they have the right to whistle me. I think I deserve it, although there were people who also applauded me, which gave me courage.</p>
      <p>"Does it hurt? No, they have to see me as a rival, not as an 18-year-old boy who plays football pretty well."</p>
      <p>Kubo spent four years in Barca's youth set-up between 2011 and 2015, before he returned to Japan.</p>
