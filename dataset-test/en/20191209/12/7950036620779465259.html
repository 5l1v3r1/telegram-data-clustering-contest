      <p>Earlier, Tshwane emergency services told TimesLIVE that more than 30 people were stranded at the Centurion Hotel on Monday afternoon due to flooding. Visuals taken from bystanders with a view of the hotel showed how vehicles parked in the courtyard were swept away in the rising waters.</p>
      <p>EMS spokesperson Charles Mabaso said 35 stranded people were moved to higher floors of the hotel.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm that we have also learnt of an evacuation taking place at the hotel. Earlier when we spoke to management they had moved to the upper floors. The flooding is at the ground floor,” he said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, several shacks at an informal settlement in Eerste Fabrieke, Mamelodi, have been swept away.</p>
      <p>"We got a number of shack dwellers trapped there because of the high water. A number of them are on rooftops but we have emergency services and water technicians there," said Mabaso.</p>
      <p>"Earlier we had reports that two children had been swept away by the water in that area, but it is not confirmed."</p>
      <p>Displaced shack dwellers would be given alternative accommodation at Mamelodi Hall, he said.</p>
      <p>Mabaso confirmed that several vehicles were underwater in Moloto, Pretoria north.</p>
      <p>"We had to rescue people from a bridge there."</p>
