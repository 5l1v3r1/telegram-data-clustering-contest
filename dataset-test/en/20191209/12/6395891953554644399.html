      <p><b>BEIJINGÂ (AP)</b> - A Chinese official says Beijing wants a prompt settlement of its trade war with Washington.</p>
      <p>A deputy commerce minister said Monday that Beijing wants "satisfactory results as soon as possible." The official gave no details of talks on a "Phase 1" deal announced by President Donald Trump in October.</p>
      <p>Another U.S. tariff hike on $160 billion of Chinese imports is due to take effect Sunday. China announced Friday it was carrying out a promise to waive punitive tariffs on American soybeans and pork.</p>
      <p>Trump alarmed global financial markets last week when he said he might be willing to wait until after next year's presidential election to reach a settlement.</p>
