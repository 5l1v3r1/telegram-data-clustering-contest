        <b>Welcome to the second annual Daily Mail Wine Awards, my favourite challenge of the year. Since early September I have been tasting the wines on our supermarket shelves furiously and compiling a list of my favourites. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I then divided up the very best bottles into 20 distinct categories or classes covering every style imaginable, before ringing up my most talented wine expert friends to assemble the ultimate judging team to pit these wines head-to-head in a series of ‘blind’ tastings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>As self-appointed chairman of this merry band of talented palates, I hosted a day of rigorous sniffing, swirling and spitting at the Daily Mail HQ in </b>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Indeed, every judge was blown away by the winners in terms of both flavour and the value they offer. I hope you enjoy reading through this list and that you hurry along to the various supermarkets with this special pullout in hand to secure the very finest wines for your </b>

      <h4>Meet the expert judges... </h4>
      <p>Jane Parkinson Matthew says: When Jane and I first met at a wine event a decade ago, I was struck by her exceptional palate and her food and wine matching acumen. She is a much-admired wine writer and contributor to BBC1’s Saturday Kitchen.</p>
      <p>Alexander Armstrong Matthew says: Alexander is one of our best-loved TV entertainers. But he’s also a gourmand and wine lover, and one of my most entertaining dining friends. His palate is classical but he’s very adept at taking a wine apart from a sensory point of view </p>
      <p>Emma Rice Matthew says: I met Emma, our technical judge, 23 years ago when she worked for London-based Burgundy specialists Domaine Direct. After studying winemaking and working all over the world, she became head winemaker at England’s prestigious Hattingley Valley winery. </p>
      <p>Matthew Jukes Matthew has worked in the UK wine business for more than 30 years and has been Weekend’s columnist for two decades. He also writes four comprehensive annual reports on wines from Bordeaux, Burgundy, Piedmont and Australia. </p>
      <p>Fred Sirieix Matthew says: You may be familiar with Fred as the smooth-talking maître d’ of Channel 4’s First Dates. And with an 18-year career guiding diners through the wine lists at world-class restaurants both in the UK and France, Fred brings his expert knowledge to our judging panel </p>
      <p>Clodagh McKenna Matthew says: As a chef, TV presenter and cookbook author there are many strings to Clodagh’s bow – and her talent for creating fabulous food is matched by her flair when it comes to judging and tasting wine. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>We’re sitting with bated breath around the banqueting table at Daily Mail HQ as Fred Sirieix, host of TV’s First Dates and discerning maître d’ of many years standing, carefully tilts a glass of red wine, swirling it around as he draws a deep breath to inhale the aromas before taking a delicate sip.</p>
      <p>Within seconds the silence is fractured by the discordant sound of his slurping and spitting. ‘It’s fantastic,’ he declares. ‘It’s leathery and animal. I really fancy a steak tartare now.’</p>
      <p>It’s just one of the wines Fred’s sampling at the judging day for the second annual Daily Mail Wine Awards, and by golly he’s enjoying himself. </p>
      <p>And who can blame him, with 110 supermarket tipples – from whites, reds and rosés to sparkling and stickies – to work his way through along with the other judges.</p>
      <p>They include entertainer and committed wine collector Alexander Armstrong, chef, author and presenter Clodagh McKenna, Saturday Kitchen’s wine expert Jane Parkinson and leading British winemaker Emma Rice. </p>
      <p>Then there are three novices (me included) who represent the average supermarket wine customer.</p>
      <p>We must decide which bottles offer the very best quality at affordable prices in 20 categories, with up to six contenders in each. </p>
      <p>Each category has a winner, with two runners-up, and the tastings are undertaken blind so the judges can’t be swayed. </p>
      <p>
        <b>A FAILSAFE GUIDE TO</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>THE WINE MINEFIELD</b>
      </p>
      <p>As our palates are becoming increasingly sophisticated, we’re all looking for fantastic wines that won’t break the bank, and no other country is as spoilt for choice as Britain. </p>
      <p>But with supermarket shelves displaying more wines than ever for the Christmas season, sorting the wheat from the chaff can be overwhelming. </p>
      <p>That’s why the Daily Mail Wine Awards proved so successful when we launched it last year, because it provides a failsafe guide to help you navigate the wine minefield.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>TODAY’S PINK SPARKLERS CAN RIVAL CHAMPAGNE</h4>
      <p>Fred grew up in Limoges in France before moving to London in 1992, aged 20, and is currently the general manager at the Michelin-starred Galvin At Windows restaurant at the top of the Hilton hotel on London’s Park Lane. </p>
      <p>He knows his onions when it comes to wine, especially fizz. </p>
      <p>‘I like Champagne to be fruity and vibrant. For romance on a first date you can’t beat a pink fizz, so I’m delighted there are so many in the sparkling category today that rival real Champagne.</p>
      <p>‘I particularly love the Sainsbury’s NV Taste the Difference Crémant de Loire Rosé from France, and when it comes to own-label Champagne, the Co-op’s NV Les Pionniers, Champagne Brut, really delivers, especially for only £18.’ </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The results have been an eye-opener for Alexander Armstrong too. Until he took part last year he would never spend less than £20 on a supermarket wine. ‘Last year’s awards made me far more open to great-quality wine at lower prices,’ admits Alexander, the host of BBC1 quiz show Pointless. </p>
      <p>‘Now I think people who go for the “grand vin” are simply time-poor, or haven’t the expertise on hand to help them find better options. I’ve dispensed with the idea that wine from the cheaper end is inferior. It’s really not. There’s astonishing craft behind a lot of these wines.’</p>
      <p>And so to the tasting. Even for the seasoned drinkers among us, with so many wines to sample surely our discernment will be compromised by the time we reach the end of this marathon tasting? Not at all, says Matthew Jukes, who explains that due to the absence of taste buds in our throats it’s not necessary to swallow the wine. Simply stick to the famous 5S system of wine tasting – see it, swirl it, sniff it, slurp it and then spit it out into the silver spittoons set out before us.</p>
      <p>Fred, who was front of house at some of the world’s finest restaurants before his TV career blossomed, believes there’s great value to be had across all styles in our supermarkets, but he’s particularly pleased when the bubblies come out. </p>
      <p>‘You don’t have to spend lots on Champagne,’ he explains, confessing good Champagne and butter are his guilty pleasures. </p>
      <p>‘There are great bottles of sparkling wine for £12-£15, and they are often what I buy. I once did a blind tasting with Champagne and Spanish cava – and everyone chose the cava over the Champagne, which shows a lot of it is about labels and image.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE NOSE TELLS THE BRAIN WHAT IT'S ABOUT TO RECEIVE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swirling the wine in the glass releases the aroma, then smelling it allows you to capture the flavour with your nose as well as your mouth. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>AMAZING REDS AT UNBEATABLE VALUE </h4>
      <p>When it comes to the red wines, London-based Irish chef Clodagh McKenna is most engaged.</p>
      <p>‘There are many good cheaper whites, but with reds I’m dubious,’ says Clodagh, whose partner is Harry Herbert, the younger brother of the Earl of Carnarvon. ‘But I was really taken aback by how many good reds there are.’</p>
      <p>Clodagh and Harry live at their 60-acre property, Broadspear in Highclere Park, next to Highclere Castle, where Downton Abbey was filmed. They both have a passion for discovering new wines, she says. </p>
      <p>‘We both absolutely love wines. We have a cellar under the stairs for our collection. I love a glass over dinner, socially and when I’m cooking. </p>
      <p>'My favourites are a full-bodied Barolo or a Spanish Rioja. But I love the 2016 Morrisons The Best Single Vineyard Pinot Noir from Aconcagua, Chile. It’s incredibly smooth, I’ll be buying it at Christmas.’</p>
      <p>Alexander’s taste buds agree. ‘This wine is extraordinary – it has a nose so full of fruit, it smells like something children may have in their packed lunches. Let’s just hope it’s not double maths afterwards!’ he chuckles.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>So with great anticipation, the judges embrace Matthew’s aromatic whites – an on-trend style gathering momentum. ‘Aroma is critical. The nose tells the brain what it’s about to receive,’ says Fred.</p>
      <p>‘My parents love Alsace wines. My dad, a nurse, would do the wine harvest, and he always brought back a lovely bottle as a pay cheque.’</p>
      <p>He’s astonished to discover, then, that the winner in this category is not a riesling but a Greek wine – Marks &amp; Spencer’s 2018 Atlantis from Santorini. ‘We are always learning, discovering something new,’ he says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SHERRY’S NOT JUST FOR GRANNY AT CHRISTMAS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Matthew has long been encouraging people to treat sherry and Madeira as year-round drinks, not just Christmas tipples, so he’s delighted to discover that manzanilla, a dry sherry, is Clodagh and Harry’s go-to drink every Friday night. </p>
      <p>‘I discovered manzanilla in Barcelona, and ever since then we always have a bottle chilling in the fridge,’ she says. </p>
      <p>‘We’ll have a plate of tapas, cured meats, almonds and olives, accompanied by some chilled manzanilla. Its sharp flavours cut through the fat of the meat. </p>
      <p>'I’m so thrilled to learn that my favourite bottle, with a dancing lady on the label – Waitrose’s NV La Gitana Manzanilla, Hidalgo, Spain – is a winner here.’</p>
      <p>Once again, Alexander agrees. ‘This manzanilla smells like olives stuffed with anchovies in oil, which is one of my favourite things in the world.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>YES, YOU CAN DRINK ROSÉ IN THE WINTER</b>
      </p>
      <p>One subject that gets the judges really talking is the controversial issue of drinking rosé in winter. As soon as we reach October, light rosés are mothballed in favour of hearty whites and robust reds. Yet there are richer rosés to warm up a winter’s eve.</p>
      <p>Emma Rice, head winemaker and director of Hattingley Valley Wines in Hampshire, which won World Champion Vintage Rosé in 2014, recognises the joy of a winter rosé. </p>
      <p>‘A rosé goes very well with turkey. You can’t always judge a rosé by its colour; people like a fashionable pale rosé but you have to be open to the taste, and the winner – Waitrose’s 2018 Mirabeau Pure Rosé from Provence – is delicious,’ she says.</p>
      <p>Emma, twice voted UK winemaker of the year, became interested in the business when she worked in a pub restaurant at the age of 18. </p>
      <p>‘When the wine waiter opened a Krug 1979, I tried it and I was blown away,’ she recalls. ‘I can still taste it now.’ </p>
      <p>But her passion today is English sparkling wine, despite tasting some 40 of them each morning during the blending season. </p>
      <p>‘The English sparkling wine business is really booming so it’s no surprise this is such an improved category. The winner – Tesco Finest English Sparkling – is impressive and great value at £19.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>BRANCH OUT WITH YOUR WINE REGIONS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Award-winning writer Jane Parkinson says that every good wine should make a lasting impression. ‘I want balance, nothing overly tannic or acidic. </p>
      <p>It’s important to let wine sit on the palate. Less complex wines fall off the edge of a cliff, but wines that linger – with a longer finish or length – leave you with waves of flavour.’</p>
      <p>Jane suggests we should be adventurous with flavours. ‘Branch out with your regions to expand your knowledge and palate. </p>
      <p>If there’s a grape you like, choose the same grape but from a different region or country – if you love red Rioja, try one from Navarra instead, Rioja’s neighbouring region.</p>
      <p>‘The Italian reds this year are delicious. But I’m especially enjoying Portuguese wines, such as Co-op’s 2018 Porta 6 from Lisbon. Many don’t know Portugal produces great table wine, they just think of port.’</p>
      <p>Jane is keen for the Daily Mail Wine Awards to open people’s eyes to new wines they may not have thought of trying. </p>
      <p>‘Take an extra two minutes at the supermarket to read the wine labels, which often give tasting notes. White wine is on a scale of dry to sweet, and red wine goes light to heavy,’ she explains.</p>
      <p>‘Beware though of labels boasting awards – check they’re up to date. But whatever you choose, remember to savour and really enjoy it.’ </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>ENGLISH SPARKLING </h3>
      <p>
        <b>English sparkling wine is hitting the high notes, and word has got out around the world that we are now a serious player in this sphere. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>After a few bountiful harvests there are now more bottles than ever before on our shelves. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Most respected brands start at £30 per bottle and rise steeply in price to more than £100, but competition is so hot below the £25 mark that I’ve managed to find three magnificent, inexpensive examples for you to buy for this year’s celebrations.</b>

      <p><b>NV Tesco Finest English Sparkling</b> <i>(£19) </i></p>
      <p>Made from 70% chardonnay and 30% pinot noir by Hush Heath Winery in Kent, this is one of the least expensive English sparkling wines around, but don’t let that put you off because the fruit here is superb and it is a worthy rival to inexpensive Champagne. </p>
      <p>The panel were so impressed with this wine that they were unanimous in voting it the winner.</p>
      <p><b>NV Co-op Irresistible Eight Acres Sparkling Rosé</b> <i>(£18) </i></p>
      <p>Another wine made by Hush Heath, this is a pale, beautifully elegant rosé. Funnily enough, the colour is so delicate the tasters had to do a double take to spot it. </p>
      <p>The 55% chardonnay, 41% pinot noir and 4% pinot meunier blend allows this wine to fill the palate while maintaining vital freshness – and it’s fantastic value for money.<b> </b></p>
      <p>
        <b>NV Ellercombe, English Sparkling </b>
        <i>(£24, reduced to £18 until 1 January, Sainsbury’s) </i>
      </p>
      <p><i> </i>Ellercombe is a brand new label for Sainsbury’s. Made from a blend of 53% chardonnay, 42% pinot noir and 5% pinot meunier, and predominantly using wine from the 2013 vintage, this is a lush style with more weight on the palate than the Tesco wine and it could step up to partner fish and chicken dishes with ease. Perhaps the turkey might be a step too far, but don’t let me stop you trying!</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>PROSECCO </h3>
      <p>
        <b>The most famous style of fizz in the UK, Prosecco is also one of the most varied in terms of quality.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you are mixing it to make a cocktail the core flavour isn’t that important, but if drinking it straight you have to be very picky, as there’s an awful lot of neutral, gassy rubbish out there. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>These are the best three bottles on the high street.</b>

      <p><b>NV Morrisons, The Best Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco, Veneto</b><b> Italy</b> <i>(£10, reduced to £8 until 31 December) </i>The winner was universally adored by the panel, and alongside the great taste it looks rather smart too. Its clean, dry, vibrant flavour makes this a sophisticated wine that I wouldn’t hesitate to serve to a wine expert.</p>
      <p><b>2018 Taste the Difference Conegliano Prosecco Superiore Brut, Veneto, Italy</b> (£10, reduced to £8 from 11 December until 1 January, Sainsbury’s) </p>
      <p>This is a finely assembled creation with exactly the right amount of vivacity on the palate and very fine bubbles. Keenly priced like the winner above, it has a superb, frothy palate and, crucially, a dry snap of acidity on the finish, as many Proseccos tend to be rather sweet and soapy.<b> </b></p>
      <p><b>2018 La Gioiosa, Prosecco Superiore Millesimato, </b><b>Veneto </b><b>Italy</b><i> </i><i>(£13.49, reduced to £8.99 until 2 January, Waitrose) </i>Creamy and refreshing, this is noticeably indulgent and a little more food-friendly than the other two wines in this section, so it can progress from aperitif duties to accompanying starters too.</p>

      <h4>WORLD SPARKLING WINES </h4>
      <p>
        <b>This class is a mixed bag of sparklers drawn from all over the planet, excluding English sparkling wine, Champagne and Prosecco. Contenders feature great raw materials and sensitive winemaking but end up hitting the shelves at very reasonable prices.</b>

      <p><b>NV Taste the Difference Crémant de Loire Rosé </b><b>France</b> <i>(£11.50, Sainsbury’s)</i></p>
      <p>Like the very pale Hush Heath sparkling rosé [see left], this crémant – a slightly less fizzy style than Champagne – has a drop-dead gorgeous, faintly coral hue and looks extraordinary in the glass. </p>
      <p>Made from 50% cabernet franc and 50% grolleau, and containing fruit from more than 100 small vineyards, this is an effortlessly classy wine that will tantalise your taste buds with its magical, wild strawberry notes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NV La Cave des Hautes Côtes Crémant de Bourgogne</b>
        <b> </b>
        <b>France</b>
        <i> (£10, Marks &amp; Spencer)</i>
      </p>
      <p>Our second crémant comes from Burgundy and is made from 75% pinot noir, 10% aligoté, 10% gamay and 5% chardonnay. </p>
      <p>Fiercely dry, it has a rapier-sharp, palate-cleansing feel and ought to cost twice the price. </p>
      <p>As a base for cocktails, this is the wine of the year, while as a straight drink it’s the perfect aperitif because it brightens the palate with its vivacious flavours.</p>
      <p><b>NV Jansz, Premium Cuvée, Tasmania </b><b>Australia</b><b><i> </i></b><i>(£17.99, Waitrose) </i>A runner-up in last year’s list, this stunner also made it onto my 100 Best Australian Wines Report, and it’s really not surprising because it gives a vintage Champagne-like flavour for a reasonable price. </p>
      <p>If you are searching for a classically made wine which uses chardonnay and pinot noir in its make-up and looks the part but doesn’t cost a bomb, this is it.</p>

        <b>NV Les Pionniers, Champagne Brut</b>
        <b> </b>
        <b>France</b>
        <b> </b>
        <i>(£19, reduced to £18 until 3 January, Co-op) </i>
      </p>
      <p>I have written up this Champagne in my weekly column many times over the years and it never disappoints. </p>
      <p>Made by the reputable Piper-Heidsieck Champagne house from 50% pinot noir, 25% chardonnay and 25% pinot meunier, this is a slightly fuller-flavoured Champagne than the Tesco wine below and it matches well with canapés as well as starters.</p>
      <p><b>NV Bredon, Cuvée Jean Louis Brut, Champagne </b><b>Franc</b><b>e</b> <i>(£25.99, reduced to £16.99 until 2 January, Waitrose)</i></p>
      <p> I was happy with Bredon at the pre-discount price, but when Waitrose sliced nine quid off this wine I nearly fell off my chair. </p>
      <p>Leading with 70% pinot meunier in the mix, bolstered by 20% pinot noir and 10% chardonnay, this is a smooth style of Champagne without the taut acidity that aficionados tend to crave. </p>
      <p>For this reason, it is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, so if you are keen to serve a creamy, juicy style of fizz this year, look no further.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NV Tesco Finest Premier Cru Champagne </b>
        <b>France</b>
        <b> </b>
        <i>(£20)</i>
      </p>
      <p>With 36 months of ageing under its belt prior to going on sale, this has a deeper, more layered flavour than the other two fellows in this class. </p>
      <p>This wine has always been a good performer in the Tesco portfolio and yet I feel it’s at the top of its game right now.</p>
      <p> Made from 70% chardonnay and 30% pinot noir, it won plaudits from the panel for being superb value as well as showing the delicacy, depth of flavour and long, even finish that mark it out as a classic Champagne. </p>

      <p>
        <b>2018 Château de Pocé, Sauvignon Blanc, Touraine, </b>
        <b>Loire France</b>
        <i> (£8, Asda) </i>
      </p>
      <p>I was delighted to see that this time-honoured Loire sauvignon romped home as our winner. </p>
      <p>The Loire is the world capital of this grape, and it is extremely rare to find a sauvignon there with this level of elegance and accuracy at only eight pounds. </p>
      <p>If I were given this wine to taste blind I would think it was a Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé at twice the price. </p>
      <p>Hurry down to Asda because this is a heroic wine, tailor-made for all manner of canapés as well as smoked salmon.</p>
      <p><b>2019 Brancott, Pinot Grigio, Marlborough </b><b>New Zealand</b> <i>(£8.25, reduced to £6.50 until 31 December, Morrisons)</i></p>
      <p>In terms of crazy bargains we have a veritable host of contenders this year, but I would never have believed the two runners-up in this class would be either side of six pounds. </p>
      <p>Brancott won the pinot grigio class last year, and it again wowed our palates with this new 2019 vintage. Silky, floral, citrussy and ever so long on the finish, this is a world-class wine at a teeny price.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2018 Terre di Vita, Organic Pinot Grigio, Sicily </b>
        <b>Italy</b>
        <i> (£7.99, reduced to £5.99 until 2 January, Waitrose) </i>
      </p>
      <p>I was wondering if Italy was going to get a look-in with its most famous white grape, pinot grigio, when I was adding up the scores from the judges. </p>
      <p>As it turned out, despite being one of the least expensive wines in the field, this snagged the second runner-up spot. Not only does it taste downright delicious, but it also ticks the organic box. At £5.99 this is a genuine steal.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>CHARDONNAY </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Arguably the greatest white grape on Earth, chardonnay often fails to impress at lower prices because it usually requires investment in expensive oak barrels in which to mature the wine. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This year, however, two amazing Aussies have made this elite list at around a tenner – but it was a white from Burgundy that stepped up to the winner’s rostrum.</b>

        <b> France</b>
        <i> (£14, Marks &amp; Spencer) </i>
      </p>
      <p>The most rewarding chardonnay on the high street, this incredible wine is made with grapes from old vines, making the flavour even more profound and intense. Silky-smooth and juicy, it’s your turkey’s very best friend this Christmas.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2018 Yering Station, The Elms Chardonnay, Yarra Valley, Victoria </b>
        <b>Australia</b>
        <b>
          <i> </i>
        </b>
        <i>(£10.49, Waitrose) </i>
      </p>
      <p>There is nothing New World about Yering Station because it won awards for its wines as far back as 1861. A regular in my 100 Best Australian Wines Report, the chardonnays made here are nothing short of sublime. </p>
      <p>Keenly priced, creamy and with a wonderful texture, this is a shimmeringly beautiful main-course white wine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2018 De Bortoli, Villages Chardonnay, Yarra Valley, Victoria </b>
        <b>Australia</b>
        <i> </i>
        <i>(£9.99, Aldi) </i>
      </p>
      <p>With a perfect climate and a multitude of talent in this region, the wines from the Yarra Valley rival every other chardonnay region in the world. </p>
      <p>De Bortoli is a famous name but it’s usually known for chardonnays costing upwards of twice this price. Make sure you taste this Chablis-shaped creation as it is incredibly impressive.</p>

        <b>South Africa</b>
        <i> (£13, Tesco) </i>
      </p>
      <p>While most South African chenin blanc is floral, light and dry, this one is completely different. It is bold, brooding, mouth-watering and loaded with honey, nut and orange blossom notes, with a heroic finish. </p>
      <p>Fred Sirieix, in particular, went nuts about this wine!</p>
      <p><b>2018 Fiano, Campania </b><b>Italy</b> <i>(£9.50, Marks &amp; Spencer) </i></p>
      <p>Not quite as powerful as the Bellingham, this fiano is unoaked, resulting in an intense flavour without it being particularly heavy. </p>
      <p>The perfume is sensational, with peach and lime notes jostling for attention, and the palate is seriously long, with a dry, pert feel, making it ideal for main-course fish and seafood dishes.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Foodie notes </h4>
      <p>I love a turkey curry, made with leftovers, and the Bellingham chenin blanc would go perfectly with it. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>2018 Vinus by Paul Mas Clairette, Languedoc </b><b>France</b> <i>(£8.25, Morrisons) </i></p>
      <p>The clairette grape is the darling of the Languedoc and is starting to become more famous in the UK. </p>
      <p>Usually this variety makes pretty, delicate wines, but winemaker Jean-Claude Mas managed to build lip-smacking creaminess into this vintage. You will revel in its perfume – it has one of the nicest noses of the year.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>AROMATIC STYLE WHITES </h4>
      <p>
        <b>This is a brilliant class of white wines. Our sense of smell is far more acute than our taste, so floral, fragrant and perfumed wines are evocative, rewarding and intriguing. These wines caress our senses.</b>

        <b>Greece </b>
        <i>(£12, M&amp;S) </i>
      </p>
      <p>This amazing white elicited oohs and aahs from the judges. Made from 90% assyrtiko, 5% aidani and 5% athiri and coming from 60-year-old vines planted on the volcanic slopes of Santorini, this has a heavenly perfume.</p>
      <p>Floral, mineral-soaked, citrus-tinged and haunting, you won’t believe a wine can smell this magical.</p>
      <p><b>2018 Mineralstein, Riesling, Pfalz </b><b>Germany</b> <i>(£9, M&amp;S) </i></p>
      <p>I met Gerd Stepp many years ago when he was a wine buyer for M&amp;S. He returned to Germany and now makes a suite of superb wines.</p>
      <p>The ‘mineral’ in the name of this one refers to the flavour the soil brings to the grapes, and it is the slatey freshness in this modern, stunning, bone-dry riesling which makes it so captivating.<b> </b></p>
      <p><b>2018 Taste the Difference Alsace Gewurztraminer, France </b>(£9, reduced to £8.50 from 11 December until 1 January, Sainsbury’s) </p>
      <p>Made by Michel Lihrmann at the famous Turckheim winery, this is a lighter gewurztraminer than most but it is this control and restraint which the judges loved. With a tropical perfume and a silky texture, this is as aromatic as a white wine gets, but the slender chassis means it slips down a treat, particularly with smoked seafood and coarse pâtés. </p>

      <p><b>2018 Taste the Difference Gavi di Gavi, Piemonte, Italy </b>(£12, reduced to £10 from 11 December until 1 January, Sainsbury’s) </p>
      <p>I met winemaker Claudio Manera more than 25 years ago and he has never stopped making first-class wines. In the UK we love the ultra-fashionable Italian style gavi and Sainsbury’s have chosen the right chap to make their elite version this year because this wine was a unanimous winner. Fine, cool, calm and gently citrus-kissed, this is a very pretty wine indeed. </p>
      <p>
        <b>2018 Voyage au Sud Vermentino, Pays d’Oc </b>
        <b>France </b>
        <i>(£5.99, Waitrose)</i>
      </p>
      <p>I am overjoyed to report another sub-£6 wine has made it into this pantheon of greats. Made from 40-year-old vermentino vines in the Saint Chinian area, this is a wine which I fell in love with at first sniff. </p>
      <p>Light, dry, zesty and pure, I know the price might not seem like it could result in a really meaningful wine, but please believe me that the panel and I can vouch for its excellence, hand on heart.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2018 Picpoul, Les Figuerettes, Languedoc </b>
        <b>France</b>
        <i> (£8, Marks &amp; Spencer) </i>
      </p>
      <p>We all love picpoul and there are loads of them about, but most are a little dilute and dull. So when I chose Les Figuerettes for the line-up I was hoping the panel would pick it out of the group.</p>
      <p>Hoorah! This is the best picpoul in the shops, it only costs £8 and the expert judges absolutely adored it.</p>

        <b>France </b>
        <i>(£14.99, reduced to £10 until 18 December, Waitrose) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Mirabeau is an eye-catching rosé with a beautiful bottle. The flavour is blessed with cantaloupe melon-silkiness and rhubarb stalk-tang. </p>
      <p>There is bright acidity on the finish, making it a winner with seafood. Smoked salmon, scallops, oysters, prawns and lobster would all be amazing with this wine.</p>

        <b>France</b>
        <b> </b>
        <i>(£12, Tesco) </i>
      </p>
      <p>This is the very first vintage of Brad and Angelina’s new, immediate-drinking-style rosé. It is a far more delicious drink than their much-vaunted estate wine, and much better value. </p>
      <p>With a forward attitude and a silkier texture, this is a mesmerising wine.</p>

        <b>Spain</b>
        <i> (£8.50, M&amp;S) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Made from a blend of garnacha and tempranillo, this is basically a red wine which only spends five or six hours in contact with its skins, so the colour ends up pink. </p>
      <p>But with deep, lusty strawberry notes and more than a little weight on the palate, if you shut your eyes this is a red wine in all but hue. </p>
      <p>You can drink it with any dish, so if you want to hedge your bets with only one bottle in this whole awards list – this is it.</p>

        <i>(£10, Morrisons) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Made by Viña Errázuriz and using French oak ageing for ten months, this has an impressive recipe. It is three years old, which gives it even more complexity. Brilliant with chicken and turkey, this is a worthy winner.<b> </b></p>
      <p><b>2018 Taste the Difference Beaujolais-Villages, Coteaux Granitiques, France </b>(£9.50, reduced to £8 from 11 December until 1 January, Sainsbury’s) </p>
      <p>This unassuming wine is made from 50-year-old vines by Mommessin, one of the oldest houses in Beaujolais. By contrast to the bubblegum and banana-scented styles of a bygone era, this is a much more forthright wine which shows real flair and breeding. Gaining much of its depth from the granitic soils of its name, this is a grand wine with a superb price point. </p>

        <i> (£6, half bottle, reduced to 2 half bottles for £9 until 31 December, Morrisons) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Combe aux Jacques is a massive favourite in my column and I have been championing this label for two decades now. It’s a delightful, cherry-soaked red with a slimline body and an invigorating message, and I was so pleased the judges spotted this wine – not least because it comes in bargain-priced half bottles.</p>

        <b> France</b>
        <i> (£14, reduced to £13 until 3 January, Co-op) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Pay special attention here – this is one of the best-value bottles around and it is seven years old, so at its peak. It’s made from 55% merlot and 45% cabernet sauvignon by the stellar wine consultant Hubert de Boüard de Laforest. </p>
      <p>If you love classic claret – and we Brits are one of the most important markets in the world for this style – you will be delighted to make your acquaintance with this wine.</p>

      <h4>Foodie notes </h4>

      <p><b>2018 Wolf Blass, Yellow Label Malbec</b><b> Australia</b> <i>(£8.50, or buy 3 for £18 until 17 December, Morrisons) </i></p>
      <p>This clever wine tucks an important 6% shiraz and 6% cabernet sauvignon into its mix, adding extra dimensions of flavour. There is 10% Hungarian oak used, too, which brings a spice and silkiness. </p>
      <p>This wine has a flavour which is twice the price, so don’t delay in tracking it down. </p>
      <p>Give it the biggest glasses you can and swirl like a demon – it loves to be aerated and its aroma will expand greatly in the glass.<b> </b></p>
      <p><b>2017 Penfolds, Koonunga Hill Shiraz/Cabernet, Australia </b>(£10, reduced to £9 from 11 December until 1 January, Sainsbury’s) </p>
      <p>This wonderful wine is both heroic and inexpensive. It is a little lighter and creamier than the amazing 2016 vintage, which was in last year’s 100 Best Australian Wines Report, but this makes it more immediately appealing and juicy. This is one of the world’s finest-value red wines and you can find it in many supermarkets in virtually every corner of the UK. Made by Australia’s most famous wine brand, Penfolds, this is an elite wine at an everyday price – and you’ll enjoy every sip. </p>

      <h3>THE RHONE VARIETIES: </h3>
      <h4>GRENACHE, SYRAH (SHIRAZ) AND MOURVEDRE  </h4>
      <p>This is a powerful class of wines which are made from a single grape variety or follow a blended regime as found in the Rhône Valley. </p>
      <p>This regime is employed all over the world, famously in France and Australia, and this year the French wines edged the Aussies 2-1 in a reversal of last year’s score.</p>

      <p>This wine did brilliantly in last year’s awards and it’s unsurprising that it won accolades from the judges again, as it comes from one of the most important wineries in South Australia. </p>
      <p>Using only the shiraz (syrah in France) grape, this is an epic wine from a legendary estate. </p>
      <p>Rich, heady and brooding, with structure, power and depth, this is one of the biggest reds in these awards and it will age well, just in case you have a bottle or two left over after the festive season.</p>
      <p><b>2018 Les Hauts de Saint Martin, Saint-Chinian, Languedoc </b><b>France</b> <i>(£7.75, Co-op) </i></p>
      <p>This style works well at lower prices, so I was encouraged to see the judges voted hard for this bargain beauty. </p>
      <p>Made from 45% syrah, 30% grenache, 15% carignan and 10% mourvèdre, this superb wine has more layers of black and red fruit flavours than I’d thought possible at this price. </p>

Drink this 54% garnacha, 16% carignan, 13% merlot, 9% cabernet and 7% syrah blend with chargrilled meat dishes and you’ll be in heaven. French and American oak are used to mature this wine, bringing layers of spice and toastiness. </p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Like the Colomé malbec [above right], this also uses French oak barrels, but with the syrah grape the barrel gives a pepper spice which augments the black cherry and mulberry tones. Drink it with mature Cheddar cheese to launch your taste buds into orbit.</p>

      <p>Colomé is an elite winery and although this is its first-rung-on-the-ladder red, it is still lavished with attention to detail. The year it spends maturing in French oak barrels – of which a third are new – brings an extra dimension of spice and flavour. </p>
      <p>The cunning addition of 10% tannat and 5% cabernet franc make this an over-engineered wine for £13.</p>

        <b>2018 Morellino di Scansano, Cecchi, Tuscany</b>
        <b> Italy </b>
        <i>(£9.99, Waitrose) </i>
      </p>
      <p>This is a fabulous find and in spite of its young age there is so much fun to be had with it – and I can’t believe the price. I love the cranberry and red cherry flavour, with its accompanying herb and new leather notes. Drink this wine with lamb cutlets for a perfect match.</p>

        <b>Tesco Finest 10-year-old Tawny Port </b>
        <b>Portugal</b>
        <i> (£12.50) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Made by the legendary Symington family, this pale, nutty, figgy style is best served slightly chilled, giving its dense flavour a cooling edge which means you can finish your feast on a high note rather than slumped in your dining room chair.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ruby Port</b>
        <b> Portugal</b>
        <i> (£7, Marks &amp; Spencer) </i>
      </p>
      <p>This is one of the least expensive ports on the shelves but it makes it into this list because it is made with exquisite care and attention by the famous Taylor’s Port house. </p>
      <p>It spends three years in large vats to soften off the plummy fruit, and the honed, mellow and velvety flavours will enchant your palate with their style and silkiness.<b> </b></p>
      <p><b>Taste the Difference Special Reserve Port, Portugal </b>(£10, reduced to £9 from 11 December until 1 January, Sainsbury’s) </p>
      <p>Another port made by the Symington Family, owners of Graham’s, Dow’s and Warre’s Ports, this budget version has all the classic flavours you find in these great names. Nine pounds is a snip for this density of flavour and regal finish. </p>

      <h3>SWEET WINES </h3>
      <p>Sweet wines remain somewhat out of fashion but I cannot stress how much they will impress guests if you take the plunge and serve one with a well-matched dessert. </p>
      <p>These three wines are very different in shape and size – and even the most reluctant sweet wine drinker will appreciate the Berton because it is so innocent and fresh.</p>

        <b>2015 Tesco Finest Semillon, Riverina, New South Wales</b>
        <b> Australia</b>
        <i> (£6, half bottle) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Made by Julie Mortlock at superstar winery De Bortoli, this is a dense, rich, marmalade and honey-soaked diva with a rich and tropical palate. </p>
      <p>In spite of the scale of the flavour, this is a bargain-priced wine and it shows just how much heady sweetness the semillon grape can muster when on tip-top form.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2018 Berton Vineyards, Botrytis Semillon </b>
        <b>Australia</b>
        <b> </b>
        <i>(£5.99, half bottle, Aldi) </i>
      </p>
      <p>You might have passed this wine by, given its teeny price point and unfamiliar name, but let me tell you that this is made by the great Bob Berton and he is one of the most fastidious winemakers in Australia. </p>
      <p>This is a lighter semillon than the Tesco Finest but it is every bit as alluring. Drink it with fresh fruit puddings and lighter cakes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2018 Coteaux du Layon, St Aubin, Domaine des Forges, Loire</b>
        <b> France</b>

          <i> </i>
        </b>
        <i>(£10.99, 50cl bottle, Waitrose) </i>
      </p>
      <p>The previous vintage of this wine was a winner last year and the 2018 is another effortlessly graceful and hypnotic wine. </p>
      <p>Made from the chenin blanc grape and coming from a very famous sweet wine region in the Loire Valley, this wine has a lemon balm and honeyed flavour which lingers on the palate. </p>
      <p>It’s not a cheapie, I know, but will impress the most knowledgeable wine lover with its class and complexity.</p>

        <b> Spain</b>
        <b>
          <i> </i>
        </b>
        <i>(£11.19, Waitrose) </i>
      </p>
      <p>A white-knuckle ride of bitingly fresh citrus with a faint salty tang, this ultra-dry sherry is water white in colour and rapier sharp in flavour. </p>
      <p>It’s the ultimate aperitif and a match for all manner of tapas. Keep a bottle in the fridge at Christmas.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tesco Finest Cream Sherry </b>
        <b>Spain</b>
        <b> </b>
        <i>(£6, half bottle, reduced to £4 until 9 December) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Made from an eight-year-old blend of dry oloroso and Pedro Ximénez (see the Sticky section below) this has a nose reminiscent of old-fashioned toffees and ripe figs – and the price is bonkers. A great match with mince pies.</p>
      <p><b>NV Blandy’s, Rich Madeira</b><b> Spain</b> <i>(£12.50, reduced to £9 until 31 December, Morrisons) </i></p>
      <p>If you want one bottle to go with both your Christmas cake and pudding, this is it. It is a tangy, full-bodied, burnt toffee and raisin-soaked style of wine.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>STICKIES </h3>
      <p>
        <b>My final class of wines needs an explanation. There is a family of sweet wines which is more sugary and toffeed than those in the Sweet class, above, but not as red wine-like as port nor as tangy as sherry and Madeira. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I call these Stickies and I imagine most people will drink them while chilling out on their sofas after dinner, because the mellow toffee flavours are so relaxing.</b>

      <p>Two PX wines, as they’re called, won a place in this section and this one is at the heavier end of the flavour spectrum. </p>
      <p>It is akin to boozy, liquidised raisins cut with dark chocolate and molasses, and you only need a small, chilled glass to satiate your palate.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Foodie notes </h4>
      <p>The stickies are at home with any dish from the ‘naughty’ list – from after-dinner chocolate to Christmas pud and sticky toffee puddings too. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>NV Curatolo, Superiore Dolce, Marsala, Sicily</b><b> Italy</b> <i>(£11.99, Waitrose) </i></p>
      <p>As Sicily brings us more whites and reds, it is important to remember that this island was once only famous for this fortified style, used mainly in cooking. </p>
      <p>Curatolo is an orange blossom and bitter citrus-spiked wine and it is both sweet and rich as well as refreshing. You will be blown away by its class.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tesco Finest Pedro Ximénez, Jerez</b>
        <b> Spain</b>
        <b> </b>
        <i>(£6, half bottle) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Made by the renowned Gonzalez Byass company, this ‘PX’ is on the lighter end of the spectrum but is still an insanely sweet, coffee, caramel and raisin-soaked wine. </p>
      <p>Christmas pud and mince pies are ideal partners. It is wickedly naughty and very affordable, given you only need a tiny glass to infiltrate every taste bud.</p>
