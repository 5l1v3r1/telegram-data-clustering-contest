      <p>US based Ghanaian social media commentator and part time musician, Archipalago has fired some salvos at familiar foe, Shatta Wale for mocking the celebs who went to meet Cardi B in her hotel room in the supposed Meet &amp; Greet session.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale jabbed the Ghanaian celebs who were ‘browned’ by Cardi B after she uninternationally failed to meet them in a prearranged Meet and Greet Session to reinforce his infamous Ghana is a village cliché.</p>
      <p>The SM boss said what the female celebrities did by lining up to greet Cardi B proves that we live in a village.</p>
      <p>He posted on Twitter:</p>
      <p>“WHEN I SAY GHANA BE VILLAGE……DEM GO TALK SAY WHY ”</p>
      <p>But Archipelago disagreed with his assertion, saying he rather made Ghana a village when be<b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/watch-the-moment-shatta-wale-flew-in-helicopter-to-his-hotel-room-before-the-cardi-b-concert/"> decided to cause a scene by flying in a chopper over to his hotel room</a> </b>so Cardi B will know he’s a big guy.</p>
