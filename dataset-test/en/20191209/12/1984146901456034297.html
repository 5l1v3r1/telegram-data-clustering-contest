      <p>Both Ciaran Clark and Allan Saint-Maximin could miss the trip to Burnley this weekend after picking up muscle injuries in the 2-1 win over Southampton.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland international - who scored at Turf Moor last term - picked up a calf injury and came off at half-time against the Saints.</p>
      <p>Although, Clark is in much better shape than Saint-Maximin after the French winger hobbled out of St James' Park admitting <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/major-injury-worry-allan-saint-17384845">he'd suffered a "bad one" after sustaining a hamstring problem.</a></p>
      <p>After the game Bruce said: "I toyed with changing us.</p>
      <p>"It's the first time we've had three games in nine days and the extra day's recovery that Southampton had is huge.</p>
      <p>"Because I didn't, we've probably picked up two muscle injuries which bear fruit of people not recovered.</p>
      <p>"When people do it at half-time and full-time like they are, basically they are fatigued."</p>
      <p>The good news for Bruce is that he has a healthy squad to bring in replacements.</p>
      <p>Sean Longstaff and Andy Carroll came off the bench and played a big part.</p>
      <p>While Atsu could be a simple choice to replace Saint-Maximin against the Clarets.</p>
      <p>Bruce added: "I'm delighted to see Longy again.</p>
      <p>"Look, the way to create the spirit when somebody comes into the team and does well is to reward them, and that's the way I've always tried to manage.</p>
      <p>"I've had Fab Schar knocking on the door for weeks now he's back fit, but Dummett and Clark and Fede have been excellent.</p>
      <p>"We've got Florian Lejeune as well, so we'll need them now.</p>
      <p>"All of a sudden, we've got six or seven [I'm presuming he means injuries], so we need that big squad and that's when I'll use them all."</p>
