      <h1>49ers vs. Saints final score: Highlights from San Francisco's thrilling win in New Orleans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:13:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>The NFL schedule cares not for the 49ers' sleep regimen. A week after traveling to the East Coast to face arguably the AFC's best team in Baltimore, San Francisco was forced to hit the road again in Week 14 for an early Sunday afternoon game against arguably the NFC's best team in New Orleans.</p>
      <p>This time, the 49ers were successful. Theirthrilling, 48-46win over the Saints on Sunday thanks to a game-winning field goal by Robbie Gouldre-established San Francisco as arguably the best team in the conference. The <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/standings/2019">standings</a>, at least until the Seahawks play the Rams on Sunday night,reflect that.</p>

      <p>The result of Sunday's game in New Orleansdirectlyimpacts the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-playoff-picture-standings-week-14-updated-afc-nfc/fxapwy1djbha1tu34bqlpg9ud">NFL playoff picture</a>. The 49ers temporarily are back to the No. 1 seedin the NFC postseason. San Francisco isone of six teams that <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-playoff-clinching-scenarios-ravens-bills-49ers-week-14/x18ke91xzi2c1wv7cpa11tnxq">can clinch a playoff spot</a> in Week 14; it needs a Los Angeles loss or tie.</p>
      <p>The Saints, of course, already clinched their playoff spot by virtue of winning the NFC South, their third consecutive division title. Now New Orleans is focused on locking in one of the top two seeds in the NFC playoffs so it can take advantage of the Superdome crowd in January. Its loss to San Francisco dropped it to the No. 3 seed in the NFC playoffs behind Green Bay.</p>
      <p>Simply put: Sunday's 49ers-Saints game was the best of the NFL season thus far, and a rematch in the postseason is entirely possible. Sporting News provided live scoring updates throughout the wild game in New Orleans. Here's how it went down.</p>

      <p><b>Pregame</b>: The running backs are players to watch in this game. Since entering the NFL in 2017, the Saints' Alvin Kamararanks second among running backs with 1,979 receiving yards and ranks fourth across all players with 4,177 scrimmage yards. Kamara, who has 587 rushing yards and 444 receiving yards this season,needs 56 receiving yardsSunday against San Franciscoto become the third player with at least 500 rushing and 500 receiving yards in each of his first three seasons in NFL history.</p>
      <p>San Francisco features one of the most balanced rushing attacks in the NFL this season. Led by running backs Matt Breida(542 rushing yards), Raheem Mostert(539) and Tevin Coleman (454), the 49ers boast the NFC’s top rushing offense (148 yards per game) in 2019. With 46 rushing yards from Coleman, San Francisco would become the first team with three running backs to each have at least 500 rushing yards in a season since the 2004 Chiefs, when Priest Holmes (892 rushing yards), Larry Johnson (581) and Derrick Blaylock(539) accomplished the feat.</p>
      <p>Additionally, if Coleman reaches 500 rushing yards for the seasonSunday, San Francisco would become the first team to have three running backs with at least 500 rushing yards each in its first 13 games of a season since the 1978 Patriots.</p>
