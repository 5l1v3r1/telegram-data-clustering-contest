      <p>On the professional side of things, the 34-year-old actress was last seen in the much-hyped Comali, which did reasonably well at the box office, impressing critics. She currently has the eagerly awaited Indian 2, directed by Shankar in her kitty. The magnum opus marks her first collaboration with Kamal Haasan and this has piqued the curiosity. The film, a sequel to the 1996 classic Indian/Hindustani, features her in a shocking new avatar, which might leave cinemagoers stunned. Siddharth and Rakul Preet too are a part of the cast.</p>
      <p>Kajal will also be seen in Paris Paris, a remake of Kangana Ranaut's Bollywood hit Queen.</p>
      <p>So, are you looking forward to her upcoming movies? Comments, please!</p>
