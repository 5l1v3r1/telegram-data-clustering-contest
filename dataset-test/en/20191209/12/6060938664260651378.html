      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bala-Devi">Bala Devi</a> was the star of the show again as she struck a brace on either side of the half time to guide India to a comfortable victory over the home side in the final.</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old striker also ended as the top-scorer of the tournament, netting five goals in four matches.</p>
      <p>India went on the offensive from the very start, as the likes of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sangita-Basfore">Sangita Basfore</a> and Ratanbala Devi dominated proceedings from the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>Ratanbala fetched the first clear-cut chance for India as she connected a Ranjana Chanu cross but her shot flew over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>India goalkeeper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aditi-Chauhan">Aditi Chauhan</a>, who has had a fantastic tournament by not conceding a single goal in five matches, turned provider when she found Bala, with a long ball upfield. The mercurial striker duly converted the chance to give India the lead in the 18th minute.</p>

      <p>India had another chance around the half-hour mark, when a Ranjana corner was headed down by captain Ashalata Devi towards Sandhiya, but the latter was flagged offside.</p>
      <p>Aditi made a couple of impressive saves on either side of the half-time break to keep India in the lead.</p>
      <p>Head coach Maymol Rocky soon brought on Manisha in place of Sandhiya, and the move had instant impact.</p>
      <p>An intricate move was converted into a chance by Ratanbala, who played Bala through on goal. Bala finished off the chance to score her second goal of the match in the 56th minute.</p>
      <p>The Indians kept dominating the game even after taking the 2-0 lead and the Nepalese were unable to create chances.</p>
