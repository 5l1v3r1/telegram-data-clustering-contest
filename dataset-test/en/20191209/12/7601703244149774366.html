      <address><time datetime="2019-12-10T12:19:36+00:00">10 Dec 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.filmibeat.com/authors/ShakthiSaiPrashanthi.html" target="_blank">Shakthi Sai Prashanthi</a></address>
      <p>Mira Nair's upcoming project 'A Suitable Boy', which stars Tabu, Ishaan Khatter, Tanya Maniktala, Namit Das and Rasika Duggal in pivotal roles has been in the headlines ever since its first look was released last week. 'A Suitable Boy' is a six-part series, which is filmed in different locations in India. The BBC drama series is written by Andrew Davies.</p>
      <p>The series is adapted from the novel of the same name by Vikram Seth. The story revolves around the life of a university student 'Lata' who is quite spirited. The drama is set to take us back to 1951.</p>
      <p>The crew of 'A Suitable Boy' began their shooting in September. Tabu shared the first glimpse of her look along with Ishaan Khatter. In the photo, she was seen wearing an anarkali dress with jasmine flowers in her hair while sitting on a swing with Ishaan, who was laying down near her feet.</p>
