      <h3>Ruiz vs. Joshua 2 fight purse, prize money</h3>
      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr. shocking Anthony Joshua with a seventh-round TKO on June 1 to become the first Mexican-American heavyweight champion of the world paved the way for this rematch and what’s reportedly a career-high purse for each boxer.</p>
      <p>Eddie Hearn secured a site fee of upwardof $40 million to deliver the highly-anticipated rematch in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, according to<a href="https://twitter.com/MikeCoppinger/status/1159925557531836416">The Athletic’s Mike Coppinger</a>.Joshua will reportedly receive a significant chunk of that amount, as he attempts to regain the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles. Meanwhile, Ruiz will reportedly cash in on a career-high payday of $9 million in his first defense of the unified crown.</p>
      <h3>What is Andy Ruiz’s net worth?</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/richest-boxers/andy-ruiz-jr-net-worth/">CelebrityNetWorth.com</a>, Ruiz’s net worth is listed as $3.5 million … for now, as the net worth doesn’t account for what he’ll make in the Joshua rematch. He reportedly earned a total income of over $7 million for upsetting Joshua in June, including pay-per-view shares and a win bonus.</p>
      <p>A quick glance at his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andy_destroyer13/?hl=en">Instagram account</a> alone and one could see how Ruiz' life has changed.</p>

      <h3>What is Anthony Joshua’s net worth?</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/richest-boxers/anthony-joshua-net-worth/">CelebrityNetWorth.com</a>, Anthony Joshua’s net worth is listed at $60 million. Of that, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/athletes/list/#tab:overall">Forbes reports</a> that the British boxer took home $55 million ($45 million in salary/winnings, $10 million in endorsements) in pay thus far during 2019 — and that’s not counting the additional check he’ll cash for the Ruiz rematch.</p>
      <h3>Andy Ruiz career record</h3>
      <p>In over 10 years as a pro, Andy Ruiz owns a 33-1 record, including 22 knockouts — obviously none bigger than the four knockdowns he used to produce a seventh-round TKO of Joshua as a 15:1 underdog back in June. A December 2016 majority decision loss to Joseph Parker marks Ruiz’ sole loss, although many boxing pundits believe the “Destroyer” did enough to have his hand raised in victory that night.</p>
      <h3>Anthony Joshua career record</h3>
      <p>Anthony Joshua hauls a 22-1 record (21 KOs) into the Diriyah Arena in Saudi Arabia to take his crack at redemption. The signature victory on the 30-year-old’s pro ledger is a thrilling 11th-round TKO of Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London back in April 2017. The victory made the 2012 Olympic gold medalist the unified world heavyweight champion. He went on to defend that crown against the likes of Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker and Alexander Povetkin, before losing it to Ruiz at Madison Square Garden on June 1. Avenging that loss with a win over Ruiz would be the former world champion's greatest ring feat yet.</p>
