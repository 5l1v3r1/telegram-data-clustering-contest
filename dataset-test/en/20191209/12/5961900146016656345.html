      <h1>Kanye West Arrives At His Opera Dressed As What I Can Only Assume Is A Fkn Weather Balloon</h1>

      <p><b>Kanye West’s</b> second opera <i>Mary</i> debuted on Sunday night, and in true Kanye fashion, he dressed up as the fucking Tin Man.</p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>Who really knows anymore, but it turns out painting your entire body silver isn’t exactly flattering.</p>

      <p>The 42-year-old was photographed outside Miami’s Marine Stadium in what I can only describe as either a weather balloon, or the fucked up lovechild of the Tin Man and the Silver Surfer.</p>

      <p>Unlike his previous opera, Kanye will actually be involved in the stage show of this story instead of narrating from behind a curtain, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/08/kanye-west-covered-silver-new-opera-mary-miami/"><b>TMZ.</b></a></p>
      <p>So what’s up with the silver suit?</p>
      <p>I don’t know a lot about the opera, which is named after The Virgin Mary, but I’m pretty confident in my religious education and I don’t remember any tin men in the bible.</p>
      <p>Shooting stars, maybe? Angels? Teapots? Who knows. Kanye West is the king of surprises.</p>
      <p>Sure, we could wait and see why he’s dressed in head-to-toe silver. But where’s the fun in that?</p>
      <p>Here are my five best guesses as to what the absolute fuck Kanye West could possibly be dressing up as for his opera performance.</p>
      <h3>Balloon Boy:</h3>
      <p>Ahh, remember Balloon Boy? The boy who got stuck in a weather balloon that turned out to be a giant hoax? Maybe that’s the energy Kanye West was going for.</p>

      <h3>Cloud Gate (The Chicago Bean):</h3>
      <p>Easily the world’s most famous bean.</p>

      <h3>A Spoon:</h3>
      <p>The resemblance is uncanny.</p>

      <h3>The Silver Surfer:</h3>
      <p>Kanye West doesn’t have the same figure as the Silver Surfer and I’ve never seen him surf, but he IS silver.</p>

      <h3>The Tin Man:</h3>
      <p>Kanye West’s makeup artist absolutely had to have this picture on their mood board. I’ll be damned if Kanye’s not wearing this exact shade of Tin Man silver face paint.</p>
