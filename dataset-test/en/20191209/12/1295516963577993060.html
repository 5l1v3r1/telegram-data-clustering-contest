      <p>As the German-dubbed boy exclaims that the explosive proton pack is the best thing he's ever seen, the headset he's wearing snaps a Polaroid photograph, which he begins to fan to accelerate its development.</p>
      <p><i>Afterlife</i> will follow a young family moving to a small town in Oklahoma where they discover their grandfather's equipment and the Ecto-1 -- with their departed patriarch strongly implied to be original <a href="https://screenrant.com/ghostbusters-afterlife-egon-grandkids-theory/amp/">Ghostbuster Egon Spengler</a> -- and the legacy of the paranormal hunters. With the trailer noting ghosts haven't been seen in 30 years, the supernatural is poised to arise with the Ghostbusters once again.</p>
