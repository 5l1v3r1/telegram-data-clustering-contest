      <p>In 1996 a movie was unleashed on the world that resurrected the slasher genre from the consumerist graveyard of the 1980s. Not only that, it completely spoofed and subverted it.</p>
      <p><i>Scream</i> was a movie that should never have happened, never should have worked. And yet it managed to redefine horror and become a cult classic.</p>
      <p>But that was twenty-three years ago. Does it still hold up in 2019?</p>

      <p>Movies With Mikey takes a look at this modern classic in his latest video for FilmJoy.</p>
      <p>He opens by enticing viewers with intrigue and a touch of history.</p>
      <p>"Scream happened at the worst imaginable time and its a miracle that anyone saw it, but lets back up a bit"</p>
      <p>After laying down a brief timeline of the most influential horror flicks, he lands on the 1980s. This was a time when the slasher sub-section of the genre ran rampant, with a large focus placed on the <i>Halloween</i>, <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i> and <i>Friday the 13th</i> franchises.</p>
      <p>This was, "The moment horror basically turned into a never-ending 1980s cocaine waterfall... make as much money as possible as fast as possible... the Disney way," says Mikey.</p>
      <p>By the mid-90s the appetite for these kinds of films had completely dried up. Yet, this was exactly when Kevin Williamson (yeah, the creator of <i>Dawson's Creek</i>) decided to shop around a classic slasher script around Hollywood... but with a twist.</p>
      <p>I'll let you experience the rest of miracle story that is <i>Scream</i> for yourselves, as well as Mikey's incredibly apt commentary regarding the now-deceased Wes Craven. But I will say that yes, the film absolutely holds up in 2019.</p>
      <p>The bedrock of violent horror films has, for the most part, been at the expense of young women. They have been maimed, murdered and raped for entertainment value - and <i>Scream</i> addressed that.</p>
      <p>In 2019 society is speaking out louder than ever about the treatment of women in both in art and the real world. While we are far from a resolution, the rumbles of rage are becoming increasingly louder.</p>
      <p>And we're seeing this reflected in film. We're seeing even more movies that place kick-arse women front and centre as more than just victims or love interests. <i>Scream</i> feels like a precursor to this important cultural shift.</p>
      <p>Mikey puts it best when he say, "Scream in 2019 is almost too relevant"</p>
      <p>Considering the franchise is about to get a reboot, he just might be right.</p>
