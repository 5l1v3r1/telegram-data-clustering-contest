      <p>Nearly six months after the company first started accepting bookings online, Revolt Intellicorp has commenced deliveries of the first batch of its RV400 electric motorcycle in Pune.</p>
      <p>The electric motorcycle will be handed over to customers, as per the booking sequence, from the two Revolt Hubs in Pune – Kalyani Nagar and ICC Tech Park. The company says that bookings for November and December have been closed and that it aims to complete all deliveries at the earliest. The RV400 comes with an innovative go-to-market pricing strategy, at Rs 3,999 per month, while the RV300 will be available at Rs 2,999 per month.</p>
      <p>Rahul Sharma, the founder of Revolt Intellicorp said, “Electric Vehicles are becoming increasingly popular in Pune and we could see the trend in the pre-booking orders. The RV400 is an important step in catering to emerging customer needs and we are confident owners are going to enjoy their riding experience. Given the continued demand for booking, we will soon be closing the bookings for January-February 2020.”</p>
      <p>The AI-enabled motorcycle has an ARAI-certified range of 156km and a top speed of 80kph. In terms of localisation, Revolt is targeting the 100 percent mark by end-FY2020.</p>
