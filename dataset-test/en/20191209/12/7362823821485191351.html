      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/mammals">drunk raccoon</a> stumbled around a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas">Christmas</a> market in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany">Germany</a> on Saturday, according to police, who said the furry creature tripped around until it eventually fell asleep — before it was shot by a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/hunting">local hunter</a>.</p>
      <p>The "obviously intoxicated" raccoon startled shoppers as it scurried around the market <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions">in Erfurt, in the state of Thuringia</a>, after it apparently drank <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/spirits">some mulled wine</a> that was left over in glasses.</p>

      <p>Videos that circulated of the trash panda reportedly showed it "wandering around, playing with a woman's shoes and then taking a rest on some steps in front of a building."</p>
      <p>The raccoon was later shot by a hunter, according to the German news outlet.</p>

      <p>It was originally reported that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/fires">firefighters</a> transported the animal to a shelter. A similar situation — involving drunk hedgehogs who came across some bottles of alcohol eggnog in the trash — reportedly happened in 2018. Those animals were taken in by a zoo.</p>
