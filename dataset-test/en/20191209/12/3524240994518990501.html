      <p>England will step up their preparations for the Euro 2020 finals with a friendly against Italy at Wembley in March, the Football Association announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate’s men will face the four-time world champions on Friday, March 27 before a match four days later against Denmark, also at Wembley.</p>
      <p>England will then travel to play Austria in Vienna on June 2 before hosting Romania on June 7 at a venue in England that has yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>The Italy game is designated as “The Heads Up International” in support of the FA’s charitable partnership with Prince William’s Heads Together mental health initiative.</p>
      <p>England will face Croatia and the Czech Republic in Group D at Euro 2020 as well as the winner of the play-off path featuring Scotland, Israel, Norway and Serbia.</p>
      <p>All three fixtures will be played at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Italy, European champions in 1968, have been placed in Group A at next year’s finals and will play all three of their pool games, against Turkey, Switzerland and Wales, in Rome.</p>
