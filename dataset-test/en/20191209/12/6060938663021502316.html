      <h1>Ranji Trophy: Shaw, Rahane hit half centuries as Mumbai score 362/8</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:55:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>VADODARA: Test specialist <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajinkya-Rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a> and young opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Prithvi-Shaw">Prithvi Shaw</a> struck gritty fifties as Mumbai ended Day 1 of their <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ranji-trophy">Ranji Trophy</a> lung opener against Baroda at 362/8 on Monday.</p>
      <p>While Rahane's patient 79 off 145 balls pulled Mumbai out of the rubble, bowlers <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shardul-Thakur">Shardul Thakur</a> (64) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shams-Mulani">Shams Mulani</a> (56 not out) contributed with the bat slamming half centuries as they ensured Mumbai ended the first day with a decent score on the board.</p>
      <p>This was Shaw's first first-class game after serving eight-month ban for doping, and he made optimum use of the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Shaw, who is eyeing the third opener's slot in Tests, made a quick 66 off 62 balls.</p>
      <p>After opting to bat, openers Jay Bista (18) and Shaw conjured a 74-run stand for the first wicket.</p>
      <p>After Bista fell, all-rounder Shubham Ranjane was promoted up the order at number three, but he fell to convert his start and was dismissed for 36 off 59 balls.</p>
      <p>Shaw, who was going all guns blazing, was certainly poised for a bigger score. He smashed 11 fours and one six as he tore into the Baroda attack.</p>
      <p>But right-arm pacer Abhimanyu Rajput cut short Shaw's stay and cleaned him up in the 18th over, with Mumbai at 95-2.</p>
      <p>Then in walked Rahane, who in the past has rescued India on numerous occasions.</p>
      <p>Rahane first added 57 runs with Ranjane to steady Mumbai's ship. However, Baroda pegged back Mumbai by removing two quick wickets -- Ranjane and skipper Suryakumar Yadav (0), who had a rare failure. Even the experienced Aditya Tare fell cheaply as Mumbai were in a spot of bother 182-5.</p>
      <p>Then Rahane, who hammered 10 boundaries, showed his mettle and held one end. He first got support from Akash Parkar (12), and later from Mulani.</p>
      <p>After his dismissal, Mulani and Shardul took the game away from Baroda with their half-centuries. Mulani hit seven fours and two sixes in his unbeaten knock, while Thakur smashed 11 fours and a six.</p>
      <p>Mulani and Shashank Attarde (5 not out) will resume Mumbai's innings on Tuesday. For Baroda, Bhargav Bhatt grabbed three wickets but gave away 110 runs.</p>
