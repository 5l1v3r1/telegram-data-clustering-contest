      <h1>Ryan Tannehill is doing MVP-like things during the Titans' winning streak</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:21:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Tannehill will not win the 2019 NFL MVP award, but his MVP-caliber play of late might just help the Titans win the AFC South.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old quarterback has been playing out of his mind over the last four games, all Tennessee victories, and the Titans are as a resultpushing both the Steelers for the sixth seed in the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-playoff-picture-standings-week-14-updated-afc-nfc/fxapwy1djbha1tu34bqlpg9ud">AFC playoff picture</a>and the Texans in the divisional race. Tannehill's latest performance, 21-of-27 passing for 391 yards, 3 TDs, 1 INT and a passer rating of 140.4 in Tennessee's blowout win over Oakland on Sunday, put him in elite company.â€‹</p>
      <p>Tannehillin Week 14 joined Packers QB Aaron Rodgers (three games in 2011) as the only players to complete at least 75 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 130 or higher (minimum 10 attempts) in three consecutive games in a single season in NFL history.</p>
      <p>Tannehill also joined Seahawks QB Russell Wilson (five games in 2015) as the only players with four consecutive games with at least two passing touchdowns and a passer rating of 125 or higher in NFL history.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Tannehill, of course, replaced Marcus Mariota when the Titans <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/titans-bench-marcus-mariota-for-ryan-tannehill-against-broncos/1d06wrnwjfj351t1n65rqn717o">benched</a> their struggling starter during a loss to the Broncos in Week 6. The QBwhom Tennessee acquired in a<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-trade-news-dolphins-ryan-tannehill-titans/17863w2uz655o1gtetuq7k96fh">trade</a>with the Dolphins in March has been the No. 1forevery game since and has only one loss asstarter:a baffling Week 9 defeat in Carolina.</p>
      <p>Now on a four-game winning streak that coincides with Tannehill'srun, the Titans are 8-5 and tied with the Steelers for the second of two AFC wild-card spots. Perhaps more importantly, they now have the same record as the division-leading Texans, whom they host in Week 15.</p>

      <p>If Tannehillleads the Titans to a division title and continues to play the best football of his NFL career, the team will need to make a decision it might not have expected to face. Tannehillsigned a one-year, $2 million contract when he arrived in Tennessee and will be an unrestricted free agent after the season. The deal was structured for the player the Titans expected Tannehill to be: an insurance policy in the event Mariota flopped in his fifth season.</p>
      <p>Mariota indeed flopped. Now Tannehill, in his seventh NFL season after spending his first six with the Dolphins, has the Titans thinking they landed something of a franchise QB for their near future.</p>

      <p>Tannehill, who has a career passer rating of 88.6, is managing career highs in completion percentage (72.7), touchdown percentage (6.8), yards per attempt (9.4) and passer rating (113.9). If he keeps it up, chances are he'll get an extension, and the Titans will ride the wave.</p>
