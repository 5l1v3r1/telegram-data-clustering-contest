      <p>James and Caitlyn, 70, bonded during their time in the jungle, starting on day one when the rugby player chose the former Olympic athlete to partner up with for the first challenge.   </p>
      <p>This year's cast of I'm A Celebrity were in a celebratory mood as they all indulged in some champagne while watching Jacqueline, 27, be crowned Queen of the Jungle.</p>
      <p>Coronation Street star Andy Whyment, 38, finished as runner-up while radio presenter Roman Kemp, 26, came in third place.  </p>
      <p>The stars indulged in a glass of bubbly before they all shared a series of snaps from the finale where they posed with Jacqueline's winning staff to mark the end of the show.</p>

      <p>While there were more than a few squabbles in the jungle over  the last few weeks, the celebrities had clearly put it all behind them as they enjoyed their remaining time in Australia together before returning home. </p>
      <p>James shared a snap of himself posing proudly alongside Jacqueline after her win, calling her 'inspirational' and a deserving winner.  </p>
      <p>He wrote: 'I could not think of a more deserving winner!! @jacjossa smashed this on so many levels. She was inspirational and dealt with every challenge like a hero. She looked after me in camp like a sister. </p>

      <p>Caitlyn Jenner also shared a snap of herself celebrating Jacqueline's win and praised the actress for how far she had come throughout her time in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The former Olympic athlete, 70, wrote: 'Congratulations to my sweet friend @jacjossa witnessing your growth on this show was amazing! Congrats Jungle Jack!'</p>
      <p>Caitlyn was joined by her partner Sophia Hutchins, 23, who said she was 'so proud' of the sports star for how she fared inside the jungle and posted a cosy snap of the pair to her Instagram.   </p>
      <p>Jacqueline became the first winner to EVER cancel live TV and newspaper interviews after Chloe Ayling's claim she had a threesome with her husband in 2018, little more than 12-months after the couple exchanged vows.</p>
      <p>Traditionally a key feature on breakfast TV, Lorraine Kelly admitted she would not be interviewing this year's winner while giving viewers a run-down of her daily show on Monday morning. </p>

      <p>A spokesperson for I'm A Celebrity told MailOnline: 'Jacqueline wants to spend as much time as possible with her family in OZ before they have to travel back to the UK. Plus she’s filming Coming Out.' </p>
      <p>Separate sources have since claimed Jacqueline is keen to avoid all publicity - some of which comes with a lucrative fee - opting instead to devote her remaining time in Australia to husband Dan and their two children, Ella, four, and 18-month old Mia.</p>
      <p>'She has to film for the coming out show which airs later this week, so cancelled all other TV offers like GMB and Lorraine to spend more time with the family,' an insider told <a href="https://mirror.co.uk/"><b>The Mirror</b></a>.</p>
