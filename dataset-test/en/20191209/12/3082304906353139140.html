        <b>According to reports, Chelsea star Marcos Alonso is being targeted by his former manager Antonio Conte, who is currently the boss of Serie A club Inter Milan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Italian news agency <a href="https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Inter/08-12-2019/asamoah-preoccupa-idea-inter-gennaio-marcos-alonso-chelsea-3501731508590.shtml"><i>Gazzetta.it</i></a> claims that both Conte and Inter Milan CEO Giuseppe Marotta are keen to sign the Spanish left-back from Chelsea after he started struggling for first-team action since new coach Frank Lampard took charge at the Stamford Bridge earlier this season.</p>
      <p>The defender and Real Madrid academy product has only played seven times in the ongoing 2019-20 season, and according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7769239/Inter-Milan-chase-Chelsea-outcast-Marcos-Alonso-Antonio-Conte-desperate-sign-left-back.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a>, he has even been told that he can leave the club in January.</p>
      <p>In case you did not know, Alonso has prior experience of playing in the Serie A, having featured for Fiorentina between 2013 and 2016.</p>
      <p>It has also been reported that the 28-year-old himself wants to return to the Serie A in January, as he reportedly misses Italy.</p>
      <p>In 2016, it was Antonio Conte who brought Alonso to Chelsea, and right now, he wants to sign the defender once again on loan with no obligation to buy – according to the English publication.</p>
      <p>But Chelsea want to sell him outright if possible and replace him with Leicester City’s Ben Chilwell or Bournemouth’s Nathan Ake.</p>
