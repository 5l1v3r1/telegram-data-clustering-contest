      <h1>Manchester City to bid for Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti in January?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/samuel-umtiti/"><b>Samuel Umtiti</b></a> as a potential transfer target.</h2>

      <p>Despite City's well-documented issues in the centre of their backline, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a> has insisted that the Premier League champions will not sign another player for that area of the pitch in January.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Get Football News France</i>, City are considering whether to move for Umtiti, who has barely featured for Barcelona this season.</p>
      <p>As a result of injury and being behind <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gerard-pique/"><b>Gerard Pique</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/clement-lenglet/"><b>Clement Lenglet</b></a> in the pecking order, Umtiti has made just five appearances in all competitions since the middle of August.</p>
      <p>Despite a persistent knee problem, City allegedly view the 26-year-old as someone who can cement his place in the team during the second half of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winner still has over three-and-a-half years left on his contract at Camp Nou.</p>
