      <h1>Besiktas chief rules out potential January swoop for Everton striker Cenk Tosun</h1>
      <h2>Everton striker Cenk Tosun continues to be linked with a move away from the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:34:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/adam-jones/" target="_blank">Adam Jones</a></address>
      <p>Besiktas president Ahmet Nur Cebi has ruled out a potential swoop for Everton striker Cenk Tosun among other rumoured targets.</p>
      <p>The Blues forward has struggled for consistent game time so far this season, making just six appearances in all competitions and only starting twice.</p>
      <p>The highlight of the Turkey international's campaign so far came against Spurs last month which saw him bag an important equaliser in added time - which led to him starting the following two games.</p>
      <p>However, the 28-year-old has lost his place in the side once more, and the lack of consistent minutes has led to a number of transfer rumours with January just around the corner.</p>
      <p>Former side Besiktas have been one of the sides linked, along with Leeds United among other sides, but the Super Eagles president has ruled out a move due to the asking price.</p>
      <p>Cebi told <a href="https://twitter.com/demarkesports/status/1203262762677354497">Hayatta Besiktas Radio station</a> [via <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/cant-give-money-want-club-chief-quizzed-signing-everton-player/">SportWitness</a>]: "I heard rumours about Anderson Talisca, Vincent Aboubakar and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cenk-tosun">Cenk Tosun</a> returning.</p>
      <p>"None of them are true. Unfortunately, we closed these chapters. We canâ€™t give the money they want."</p>
      <p>Tosun has been an un-used substitute for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> in each of their last three Premier League matches.</p>
