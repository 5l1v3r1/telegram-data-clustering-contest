      <h1>Davy Russell hoping for weekend return after illness</h1>

      <p>Davy Russell hopes to return to the saddle this weekend after falling ill at Punchestown on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The three-times champion jockey partnered Mount Ida to finish second in the Voler La Vedette Mares Novice Hurdle and entered the parade ring to ride Artic Pearl in the following race.</p>
      <p>However, he did not take up his mount after feeling sick, which caused a delay to racing while Jack Kennedy weighed out to replace him.</p>
      <p>Russell subsequently missed the ride on Presenting Percy, who made a promising start to his campaign when third in the featured John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase under JJ Slevin.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Monday morning, Russell said: “I still feel a bit sick, to be honest.</p>
      <p>“I’m not riding at Tramore tomorrow (Tuesday). Hopefully I’ll be back for the weekend after having some medication.”</p>
      <p>Racing in Ireland this weekend is due to take place at Fairyhouse on Saturday and Navan on Sunday.</p>
