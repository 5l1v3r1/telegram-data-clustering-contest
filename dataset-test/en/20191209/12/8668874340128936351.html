      <h1>Sexton's Six Nations worry as Leinster confirm out-half will miss Northampton game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:41:57+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Johnny Sexton has emerged as a doubt for Ireland’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> campaign after <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster">Leinster</a> confirmed the out-half will not be available for this weekend’s Heineken Champions Cup game against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton">Northampton</a> Saints due to a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Sexton was forced off in Leinster’s 43-16 win at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday after falling awkwardly while being tackled.</p>
      <p>The province have confirmed that the 34-year-old will see a specialist today for a further scan on his knee.</p>

      <p>The news will come as a concern for new <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> head coach Andy Farrell, with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> just eight weeks away.</p>
      <p>Farrell will take his first training camp as Ireland boss later this month, and Sexton’s fitness will be a chief concern, with Farrell also without the on-field experience of the recently retired Rory Best.</p>
      <p>Joe Schmidt’s successor is in danger of being left light on out-half options, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/joey-carbery/">Joey Carbery</a> yet to feature for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> this season having returned from the World Cup with an ankle problem.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Leinster also confirmed that <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/joe-tomane/">Joe Tomane</a> will be out of action for six to eight weeks following a re-occurrence of a hamstring injury, and Rory O’Loughlin will also miss out at the Aviva Stadium this weekend as he rehabs a shoulder problem.</p>
      <p>James Ryan is going through the Graduated Return to Play protocols after being removed during Saturday’s defeat of Northampton with a head injury.</p>
