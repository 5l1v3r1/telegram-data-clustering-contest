Chennaiyin will have new manager Owen Coyle in the dugout for the first time.</p>
      <p>Jamshedpur, sitting fourth are currently on 11 points while Chennaiyin are on 5 points, where the latter has the oppportunity to make an impressive start uner the new manager and move upto sixth in the table. But, considering Sergio Castel’s form and Antonio Iriondo’s astute tactics, that task will prove to be difficult for the 2017/18 champions. While Jamshedpur have lost just one of their last 13 home matches, Chennaiyin are yet to score on the road this season.</p>
