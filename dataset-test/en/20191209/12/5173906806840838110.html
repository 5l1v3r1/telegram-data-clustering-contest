        <b>Airlines from Angola, Sao Tome and Principe and Equatorial Guinea are on the 'black list' of 115 airlines banned from flying to the European Union (EU), released in Brussels on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Six are on the list individually, for reasons due to safety problems of the airlines themselves, such as Avior Alirlines of Venezuela and the other 109 - certified in 15 countries - for insufficient control by their national authorities.</p>
      <p>The list includes seven airlines from Angola, of which only TAAG and Heli Malongo are excluded from the list, all from São Tomé and Príncipe and also all those registered in Equatorial Guinea.</p>
      <p>The list is regularly updated.</p>
