      <h1>Pep Guardiola names FIVE teams Man City can't compete with</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:47:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">Metro Sport Reporter</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pep-guardiola/">Pep Guardiola</a> believes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are one of five teams who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> are unable to compete with.</p>
      <p>City suffered another blow to their hopes to retaining the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> title on Saturday as they suffered a 2-1 defeat against United.</p>
      <p>Guardiola’s side are now 14 points behind league leaders Liverpool and no team have ever been able to overcome a deficit as big as that to win the Premier League.</p>
      <p>But despite winning all three domestic trophies this year, Guardiola claims City are unable to compete with Liverpool, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus.</p>

      <p>‘United have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counter-attack and you have to accept that,’ said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>‘That is the level we face against Liverpool, United, Barcelona, [Real] Madrid, Juventus, they are the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them.</p>
      <p>‘We have to improve and accept it and move forward. Maybe we need to live that as a club to improve, to accept the reality now and improve.’</p>
      <p>Guardiola also dismissed the idea of City now turning their focus to winning the Champions League ahead of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>‘The reality is we are 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially, as well, the things we cannot control. That is the reality but we have to continue,’ said the City manager.</p>
      <p>‘We are at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play in and other games to fight and improve on.</p>
      <p>‘We are not thinking of winning the Champions League, I am not thinking about how many points we need or how many points they have to drop. We are trying to win games, to win the next one.’</p>
