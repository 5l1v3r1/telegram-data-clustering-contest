      <p>The other day, Janasena President <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/when-allu-arjun-said-pawan-kalyan-fans-didnt-like-it/">Pawan Kalyan </a>has made a harsh but interesting comment on Janasainiks. Irked by their whistles and claps during his speech, he went on to say that they are indisciplined and due to that, Janasena lost the elections.</p>
      <p>Fans were very much hurt with this comment but in the hindsight, there is some merit in Pawan Kalyan’s comment despite it being harsh on fans. Pawan Kalyan has this problem of fans being hyper-energetic in Public Meetings just like the film audio Functions</p>
      <p>But Politics needs seriousness in most issues. Often when Pawan Kalyan goes to address some issues, the seriousness is diluted with the enthusiasm of fans. As a result, Janasena has got the image of a non-serious Political Party. Other than enthusiastic fans, common people are hesitant to tilt towards the party.</p>
      <p>There are other factors as well which contributed to Janasena’s loss but this indiscipline also played a role. Having said that all, Janasena is nothing if not these enthusiastic fans. So we can say they come as a package to Janasena. Let us see if things change for good in 2024.</p>
