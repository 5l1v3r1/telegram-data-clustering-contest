      <h1>Danny Murphy hammers reports of Everton approaching ex-Arsenal manager Unai Emery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:45:16+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Danny Murphy has told TalkSPORT (Monday, 11:30am) that reports of Unai Emery moving to Everton is “absolutely nonsensical”, following the Spaniard’s sacking at Arsenal last month.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports have claimed that an ‘informal meeting’ has taken place between Everton and Emery in London of late, and that the former Paris Saint-Germain manager is open to remaining in England – but is also open to jobs in Spain and Italy.</p>
      <p>Emery was sacked by Arsenal after two months without a league win. The Spanish boss does have plenty of pedigree, winning the Europa League title three times and the French league title during his time with PSG.</p>
      <p>Former England midfielder Murphy responded to those reports by hammering any chance of Emery joining Everton. He claimed Emery does not understand the Premier League, claiming it is “ludicrous”.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t personal against Emery,” Murphy said. “If you think he is the answer at Everton – he was a broken man at Arsenal. He doesn’t understand the Premier League. That is an absolute recipe for disaster. Whoever is advising that needs sacking and putting on a plane. Absolutely nonsensical. Ludicrous.”<span dir="ltr"><br/></span></p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Murphy is bang on, Emery is not the answer for Everton</h3>
      <p>Despite Everton’s stunning 3-1 win over Chelsea on the weekend, Everton remain in a perilous position in the Premier League – languishing above the relegation zone. They need a manager who can stabilise the club.</p>
      <p>A manager like Emery will want to impose his style and that is a risk given Everton’s position. The Toffees are better off giving Ferguson the role until the end of the season and then re-evaluating the situation in May.</p>
