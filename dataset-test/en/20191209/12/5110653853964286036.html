      <p>The 2020 Sugar Bowl will feature Florida and Virginia.</p>
      <p>The Gators and Cavaliers have played just once all-time. No. 19 Florida pummeled Virginia 55-10 in 1959, and the two teams haven't faced off since.</p>
      <p>Florida finished the regular season 10-2 with a 6-2 record in SEC play. The Gators' signature win was a 24-13 victory over No. 7 Auburn in October.</p>
      <p>Virginia finished the regular season 9-4 with a 6-2 record in ACC play. Virginia has yet to record a top-25 win but <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/why-virginias-upset-of-virginia-tech-was-a-big-deal-even-for-the-average-fan/3qlm76j4942i17eondrc4gplx">defeated rival Virginia Tech</a> for the first time since 2003 on Nov. 29.</p>

      <h3>Orange Bowl 2020 odds</h3>
      <p>This section will be updated when opening odds are released.</p>
      <h3>Florida vs. Virginia three things to watch</h3>
      <h4>Florida's running game</h4>
      <p>Three Gators have recorded four rushing touchdowns this season (Lamical Perine, Dameon Pierce and Emory Jones). Perine leads the way with 118 attempts and 539 rushing yards. Florida is 6-1 when Perine has at least 10 carries.</p>
      <h4>Can Virginia put up enough points?</h4>
      <p>Virginia has played just two top-25 games all season, tallying 20 points in a September loss to Notre Dame and scoring 17 points against Clemson in the ACC championship loss. Florida hasn't allowed more than 28 points all season.</p>
      <h4>Bryce Perkins</h4>
      <p>Virginia quarterback Bryce Perkins has recorded five passing touchdowns and five interceptions in losses this season, but has 13 passing touchdowns and six interceptions in wins. He will need to be sharp against Florida's stingy defense in order to pick up the win.</p>
