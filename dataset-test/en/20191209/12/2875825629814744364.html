      <p>She claimed to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10492866/chloe-ayling-dan-osborne-threesome-jacqueline-jossa-threesome/">The Sun</a> that after a night of boozing and partying - which saw the stars papped together - they went back to a hotel and engaged in sexual activity together.</p>
      <p>Chloe claims that she watched Dan have full sex with Natalie, who was married to Jacob at the time, before kissing and performing a sex act on Chloe.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline's campmate Myles Stephenson also told her he believed Dan had cheated with Myles' ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> .</p>

      <p>Dan has firmly denied all claims, as has Gabby.</p>
      <p>While they did go out partying together that night, Dan says that absolutely nothing happened between them and denies that he was unfaithful to Jacqueline, with whom he shares daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one.</p>
      <p>A representative for Dan told Mirror Online: "This story is not true and Dan will be seeking legal advice."</p>
