      <p>This week sees the annual return of industry ceremony/advertising bonanza <a href="https://thegameawards.com/">The Game Awards</a>, as Geoff Keighley takes to the stage once again to hand out gongs for some of 2019's greatest games, in between developer chats and performances by artists Green Day and Chvrches<br/><br/>But those of you tuning in hoping to see some exciting announcements are apparently going to be in your element, as Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1203101366563921920?s=20">has noted in a recent Twitter video</a> that around 15 new game announcements are expected to be made during the 150-minute show. We know that Capcom's rumoured <i>Resident Evil 3</i> won't be in attendance, and that we'll definitely be seeing the debut title from Wolfeye Studios, but everything else is up in the air.<br/><br/>Between The Game Awards and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../sony-s-nintendo-direct-like-state-of-play-show-will-return-next-week-574380.phtml">Sony's State of Play</a>, this could be a <i>really</i> big news week. What would you like to see make its shining debut across these two events? Personally, I'd like to see something on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../wb-games-montreal-seem-to-be-teasing-new-court-of-owls-batman-game-567719.phtml">the teased Batman project</a>. But it's not all about me, I'm starting to come to terms with that now. So drop us a note below and let us know what would get your hype fire stoked.<br/><br/><a href="https://thegameawards.com/">The Game Awards 2019</a> takes place Thursday, December 12 at 17:30 PT / 20:30 ET / 01:30 BST.</p>
