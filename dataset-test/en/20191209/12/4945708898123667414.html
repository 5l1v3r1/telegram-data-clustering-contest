      <h1>EU opens subsidies for electric battery push</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:21:31+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Pigman</a></address>
      <p>The EU's powerful anti-trust authority on Monday approved billions of euros in subsidies from seven member states as Europe seeks to make up lost ground in batteries.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a big push led by Germany and France to prepare Europe for the emergence of electric cars, as gas combustible engines are phased out over <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/climate+change+concerns/">climate change concerns</a>.</p>
      <p>The European car industry employs over 10 million people and the EU is deeply concerned about Europe's dependence in a highly strategy sector on car batteries from Asia.</p>
      <p>Batteries represent 40 percent of the cost of an electric car and are currently manufactured by companies in South Korea, China and Japan.</p>
      <p>The mega subsidy of 3.2 billion euros ($3.5 billion) from Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Belgium, Sweden and Finland will go to a consortium of 17 companies and will help generate an extra five billion euros in <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/private+investment/">private investment</a>, a statement said.</p>
      <p>The European Commission, the EU's executive and anti-trust enforcer, usually holds a strict line against state subsidies, but in 2014 gave more leeway for countries to back strategic transnational projects.</p>
      <p>"I am delighted that the Commission has verified and authorised the first major <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/battery/">battery</a> project in Europe in just a few weeks," said German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier in a statement.</p>
      <p>This is "a great success for Germany and Europe," he added.</p>
      <p>The wave of new subsidies are part of something called the European Battery Alliance, a rare effort by Brussels to centralise industrial policy.</p>
      <p>The campaign, launched in 2017, was designed to entice European industry to create a so-called "Airbus of batteries", in reference to the aviation giant that was born from wide array of semi-private companies a generation ago.</p>
      <p>Companies involved in the battery projects include German car giant BMW and chemical multinationals BASF and Solvay.</p>
      <p>"The emergence of the European battery industry will contribute to the achievement of the objective set by the European Union to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050," said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.</p>
      <p>The battery greenlight comes just days before the EU commission announces its Green New Deal agenda, that includes an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality as well as boost climate-friendly investment.</p>
      <p>To come to fruition, the Green New Deal will require EU member states to further open national coffers, a prospect that has already received resistance from the Germany, the Netherlands and other wealthy northern states.</p>
