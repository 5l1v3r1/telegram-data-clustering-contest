      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/paramilitary-forces">Paramilitary forces </a>in the country will soon use khadi fabric in their uniforms after a direction in this regard was issued by Union Home Minister Amit Shah to Director Generals (DGs) of the troops, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"The Khadi and Village Industries products will get a major boost as Union Home Minister Amit Shah has recently instructed the Director Generals (DGs) of all <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/paramilitary-forces">paramilitary forces </a>to use khadi fabric in their uniforms and Village Industries products such as pickles, papad, honey, soaps and detergents, shampoos, phenol, tea, mustard oil etc. in their canteens," KVIC said in a statement.</p>
      <p>KVIC Chairman V K Saxena informed that samples of cotton and woollen uniforms, blankets and camouflage uniform, among others, for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/paramilitary-forces">paramilitary forces </a>have been developed by KVIC and have been submitted to few forces for final approval.</p>
      <p>"This move will not only double the Khadi and Village Industries turnover which is nearly Rs 75,000 crore currently, but also create millions of additional man-hours for khadi artisans who will weave millions of metres of khadi fabric for our paramilitary forces," Saxena said.</p>
