      <p>Bookies are celebrating what they are calling their "best ever reality TV result" after Jacqueline Jossa's shock win on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.</p>
      <p>Going into Sunday's life final of the hit ITV show, EastEnders actress Jacqueline was <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-winner-odds-17262670">well behind odds-on favourite Andy Whyment in the betting</a> to take the jungle crown, so <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/jacqueline-jossa-wins-im-celebrity-17385401">her victory</a> stunned everyone, including bookmakers across the land.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline looked shell-shocked at being told by hosts Ant &amp; Dec that she was the new Queen of the Jungle and while she was getting her crown, bookies were in high spirits.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-andy-whyment-im-celebrity-17385091">Andy Whyment</a> was the red hot favourite and we cannot believe that the market has got it so wrong,” said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams. This will go down as one of our best ever reality TV results.”</p>
      <p>The favourite to win <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity 2019</a> changed rapidly during the first week of the new series, with early tip to win Ian Wright falling away significantly after a number of jungle spats. Caitlyn Jenner had a spell at the front of the pack before JAcqueline and third place contestant Roman Kemp led the way as joint favourites.</p>
      <p>But that all changed when Coronation Street Andy entered as a late arrival alongside fellow soapstar Cliff Parisi, with odds on him winning cut short from the off and he led the betting all the way until the final result was revealed.</p>
