      <p>Taylor spent two seasons on the south coast, with further loan spells away from the Cherries before joining Scottish club Falkirk on a free transfer in 2012.</p>
      <p>A prolific debut season saw Taylor bag 29 goals in 42 appearances, and that form caught the attention of Sheffield United who signed him in 2013.</p>
      <p>The striker still could get settled, with further loan stints in Scotland with Patrick thistle and a permanent move to Scunthorpe not working out.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until Taylor signed for AFC Wimbledon in 2015 that he found a home, with the striker netting 55 goals in 150 appearances during a three year spell.</p>
      <p>That form saw Taylor earn a move to Charlton Athletic in the summer of 2018, and in his debut season for Addicks he scored 25 goals in 45 appearances and helped the club secure promotion to the Championship through the League One play-offs.</p>
      <p>Taylor agreed a two-year deal at The Valley upon arriving at the club, and the reports linking the striker with Forest also claim that Charlton are looking to extend his contract.</p>
