      </p>
      <p>Brady went 19-of-36 passing for 169 yards, a touchdown and an interception in the loss to Kansas City, which is now 9-4 and pushing New England for the No. 2 seed in the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-playoff-picture-standings-week-14-updated-afc-nfc/fxapwy1djbha1tu34bqlpg9ud">AFC playoff picture</a>.</p>
      <p>The six-time Super Bowl champion, who was unwilling to criticize officials despite some controversy related to officiating Sunday, said the Patriots' offense was simply unable to deliver in key moments.</p>
      <p>"We got the ball, we moved it, we had some plays there where we could've scored and just couldn't quite," Brady said. "We had a fourth down, we had some other ones in a red area, couple of fourth downs, just didn't make the plays when we needed to make 'em."</p>
      <p>Added Brady: "We've just got to go out and try to play better and try to win next week's game so, disappointing but not going to feel sorry for ourselves, try to go back to work and do a better job."</p>
