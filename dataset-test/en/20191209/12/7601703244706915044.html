      <h1>Saif Ali Khan On Mean Comments During His First Few Auditions: 'People Felt I Looked Like A Girl'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:22:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.filmibeat.com/authors/madhuri.html" target="_blank">Madhuri V</a></address>
      <p>Despite belonging to a royal lineage and having an actress-mother, Saif Ali Khan had to go through his own set of struggles when he decided to join the film industry. In his latest interview with a leading entertainment portal, the actor opened up about how he had to battle different perceptions which were created for him during his initial days in showbiz.</p>
      <p>The actor also admitted that while he had to live up to his mother and father's name in the business, there was a point in his life when he was clueless about his ambition.</p>

      <p>A Pinkvilla report quoted Saif as saying, "I was clueless after school and I didn't know what to do when I joined films. I just knew I didn't want to do a desk job. I thought I'll die if I have to do a 9-5 thing. The idea of films was very different because of the variety of the job."</p>
      <p>The actor revealed why he didn't become a cricketer like his father. He said, "Cricket was in my blood, it's treated like religion. Not just my dad, my grandad also captained India and played against Don Bradman. I played good cricket and I never played in school or college. What let me down is that cricket is a very mental game, it's about patience and timing. That I was strongly lacking in and that's why my cricket career was doomed."</p>
      <p>In the same interview, Saif also spoke about how people passed mean comments on his looks and voice when he started his journey in Bollywood.</p>
      <p>Talking about his first few auditions, the actor revealed, "People have been nasty. They have been mean. People talk about your looks. I guess I didn't look like a hero. Akshay Kumar did. They felt I looked like a girl. I certainly had a bad voice which I hadn't worked on. So sometimes, I was squeaking away in an English accent."</p>
      <p>From those 'struggling' days to now, over a period of time, Saif has many impressive performances to his credit and we wonder what those people have to say about him now.</p>
      <p>Coming to Saif's upcoming projects, the actor plays the main antagonist in Ajay Devgn's 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior'. Besides this, he will also be seen in 'Jawaani Jaaneman', 'Bunty Aur Babli 2' and a 3D horror-comedy titled 'Bhoot Police'.</p>
