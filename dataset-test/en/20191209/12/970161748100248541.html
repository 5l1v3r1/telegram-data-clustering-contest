      <p>It’s not every school day that a former First Lady and a Hollywood A-lister come into class.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-obama/">Michelle Obama</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/julia-roberts/">Julia Roberts</a> gave a group of school students a morning to remember earlier today (9 December) as part of their mission to promote girls’ education in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The visit is part of an ongoing charitable trip to the Far East that’s been organised by the <a href="https://www.obama.org/updates/julia-roberts-join-michelle-obama-conversation-leaders-asia-pacific/">Obama Foundation</a>, and Roberts will speak on Thursday (12 December) alongside Obama at a panel at the Foundation’s inaugural Leaders: Asia-Pacific conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>

      <p>Today’s engagement saw the Foundation’s Girls Opportunity Alliance invite Obama and Roberts to a school in the Long An province to meet students who are benefiting from programs which aim to ‘help adolescent girls reach their full potential through education’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the students, Obama highlighted the ‘power, voice and opportunity’ that girls can achieve through education.</p>
      <p>‘When you educate a girl you give them power and a voice and an opportunity to improve their lives and the lives of their family and the lives of their community,’ she told the students (via <a href="https://www.brecorder.com/2019/12/09/551649/michelle-obama-julia-roberts-urge-vietnam-girls-to-stay-in-school/">Business Recorder</a>).</p>

      <p>‘I want you all to stay committed and focused, it will get tough at times — it already has for some of you — but it is well worth it.</p>
      <p>‘Even if your families don’t understand that today, trust me they will, when you go off to college or start your businesses.’</p>
      <p>Inspiring words as ever from Michelle Obama, and she and Roberts were pictured smiling and laughing with the students throughout their visit to the school.</p>

      <p>Speaking to AFP, 16-year-old student Truong Thi Hai Yen said she was particularly inspired by hearing Obama’s words of wisdom.</p>
      <p>‘She kept trying every day to be better, and now we can see that she is very successful.’</p>
