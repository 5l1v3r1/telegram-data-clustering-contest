      <p>Newcastle United are reportedly keen on signing Championship striker Macauley Bonne.</p>
      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/football/640849/newcastle-leicester-fulham-charlton-striker-macauley-bonne/">According to talkSPORT</a>, the Magpies are ‘slightly ahead’ of the likes of Leicester City and Fulham for the 24-year-old, who has been in impressive form recently.</p>

      <p>Bonne has six Championship goals so far this season, and has caught the eye since replacing the injured Lyle Taylor.</p>
      <p>Bonne only signed for the Addicks in the summer just gone on a three-year deal for a reported £200,000.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe international was only playing National League football with Leyton Orient before his switch to the Valley, but scored 23 last term and 22 in 2017/28.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Bonne a risk worth taking for Newcastle?</h3>
      <p>Bonne has proven himself to be a prolific lower league striker over the past few years, and perhaps he could do a job in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It would certainly be a big risk for Newcastle, but he arguably couldn’t do too much worse than any of Steve Bruce’s current forwards.</p>

      <p>Goals have mainly been scored by the defence and the midfield so far this term, and Joelinton is showing he may need a full season to adapt to English football.</p>
      <p>Question marks remain over Dwight Gayle’s potential to score goals regularly in the Premier League, and Andy Carroll is effective but his injury record means there can be no guarantees.</p>
