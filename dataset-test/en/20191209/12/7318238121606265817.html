      <h1>Russia banned from international sporting events for 4 years over doping</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:04:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Smith and Matthew BodnerÂ </a></address>
      <p>Russia has been banned from all major sporting competitions for four years after a string of controversies concerning its athletes' use of banned drugs, the Russian state-owned <a href="https://tass.com/sport/1097131">Tass news agency reported</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>According to Tass, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said Russia would not be able to officially compete in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo or the 2022 soccer World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>However, while the Russian flag cannot be present at events, <a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/11/25/russia-doping-olympics-ban/">Russian athletes can compete under a neutral flag</a> if they are free of association with the doping scandal. Some 168 Russian athletes competed at the 2018 winter Olympics in Pyeongchang under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>WADA's executive board recommended a four-year ban in November this year. Russia handed over laboratory data to WADA in January as part of a deal to lift the suspension of the Russian anti-doping agency. But WADA then accused Russia of tampering with the evidence.</p>
