      <p>Johannesburg - The embattled Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) had been placed under administration by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, who dissolved the entityâ€™s interim board.</p>
      <p>Addressing the media on the decision, Mbalula said the crisis at the rail agency could not be solved by replacing the current board with a new one.</p>
      <p>He said the continued decline of the quality of service provided by Prasa to the commuting public required urgent intervention.</p>
      <p>Last week, Mbalula had indicated the process of making changes to the leadership of Prasa was at an advanced stage.</p>
      <p>On Monday, he said the entity had been riddled with mismanagement and governance challenges over the past decade of its existence.</p>
