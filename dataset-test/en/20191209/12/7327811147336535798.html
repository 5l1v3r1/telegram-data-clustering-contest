      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- A study on whether to mandate additional legroom and seat width on airplanes is late on arrival.</p>
      <p>Senator Charles Schumer says results of the study by the FAA were due this past October, but the agency hasn't submitted anything yet.</p>
      <p>Schumer is demanding that the federal report be comprehensive and says that the airlines have been stuffing passengers into seats as if they were sardines for far too long.</p>
      <p>"It was at one point 25 inches for legroom, it is now 21, it was 18 and a half inches for seat width and it's now 17," Sen. Schumer said. "That's the average."</p>
      <p>The senator added that current tests don't cover the impact that seat size has on the disabled, children, and pets and there could be safety concerns during an evacuation.</p>
