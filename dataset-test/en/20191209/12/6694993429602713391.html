      <h1>The mood at Manchester United following Man City and Tottenham wins</h1>
      <h2>Man United had their best week yet under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last week and the mood at Carrington has improved immeasurably.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Luckhurst, http://www.facebook.com/samuelluckhurstjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>The mood at Manchester United under <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has 'never been better' following their potentially defining wins over Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> beat <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league">Champions League</a> finalists Tottenham and reigning <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League,</a> FA Cup and League Cup winners City 2-1 last week to rise to fifth in the Premier League table and go within five points of Chelsea in fourth.</p>
      <p>Dressing room sources have told the MEN United is a 'happy club' and the players are especially delighted Solskjaer's idealistic approach of winning with attacking football through a homegrown core and key signings was vindicated against Spurs and City.</p>
      <p>United players have remained totally behind Solskjaer and the MEN understands the club hierarchy have not been made aware of any qualms comparable with the management style of Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal.</p>
      <p>Senior clubs sources told the MEN the United players were 'walking on eggshells' during the final months of Mourinho's tenure and some senior players described last season as 'one of the most challenging and tiring'. There was more severe acrimony towards the end of Van Gaal's reign.</p>
      <p>Though United have two points fewer than at this stage last term, the harmony in the squad has never been compromised amid questionable form and results prior to last week's triumphs. Sources at the club's Carrington training complex say it has been a 'happy working environment' since the players returned for pre-season training in early July and Solskjaer and his staff have remained popular among the squad, irrespective of results. The United players genuinely believe fine margins have decided some of their defeats and draws.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer has remained optimistic irrespective of United's form and said on Saturday he drew positives from negative results. "If you look behind the results, I’m not as negative as you are. I’m not so worried, so concerned.</p>
      <p>"We know we can play quick, attacking football when we get the shape right, as we did today. The attitude was spot on and every time we had the ball it seemed like could carve them open.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't matter if it was two passes or four passes or 10. The first-half was attacking football as it should be played. That's the Man United we've talked about - and the personality. Boys being out there with great character and attitude.</p>
      <p>"We got tired and dug in towards the end but none of them give up. They don't give up and they hang in there. I've said so many times, I've got boys here who want to improve."</p>
