      <h1>The Conjuring 3: Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson returning for sequel</h1>

        <b>It’s confirmed, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are returning for The Conjuring 3 next year as the billion-dollar blockbuster franchise continues to expand.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Warner Bros. has announced that the forthcoming sequel will be titled The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, and will see Vera and Patrick reprise their iconic roles as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.</p>
      <p>It’ll arrive in cinemas on 11 September 2020.</p>
      <p>The Conjuring 3 could be the most chilling installment yet as it’s set to center on one of the most haunting cases from Ed and Lorraine’s files.</p>
      <p>According to the synopsis The Devil Made Me Do It is ‘a chilling story of terror, murder and unknown evil that shocked even experienced real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.</p>
      <p>‘One of the most sensational cases from their files, it starts with a fight for the soul of a young boy, then takes them beyond anything they’d ever seen before, to mark the first time in US history that a murder suspect would claim demonic possession as a defence.’</p>
      <p>Fans are a little disappointed that James Wan, who directed the first two Conjuring movies, isn’t jumping on-board for the third. Instead, he’s leaving it down to Michael Chaves who directed this summer’s The Curse of La Llorona, which isn’t explicitly a Conjuring movie but does have ties to the universe.</p>

      <p>The Conjuring Universe has reignited the horror movie industry over the past decade and has grossed more than $1.8 billion worldwide.</p>
      <p>Spin-off movies have so far included three Annabelle movies, including this year’s Annabelle Comes Home, and The Nun.</p>
      <p>The first Conjuring movie, released in 2013, centered on a family being terrorised in their Rhode Island home. It grossed an impressive $319.5 m on a budget of $20 million.</p>
      <p>Conjuring 2 was released in 2015 and retold the story of the Enfield hauntings in North London and grossed $320.4 million.</p>
      <p>Teasing what fans can expect from The Conjuring 3, Patrick told The Hollywood Reporter just last month: ‘The process [of making Conjuring 3] was fantastic, and it’s a much different feel.</p>

      <p>‘It’s still the same bones; it’s still very much Ed and Lorraine. Again, we are pushing our characters to places they haven’t gone, but the film will be a really nice addition because it’s definitely a different beast. Pun intended.’</p>
      <p>His on-screen wife Vera also told Entertainment Weekly earlier this year: ‘Conjuring 3 is coming, and it will be a doozy. It will be big.</p>
      <p>‘So for me, visiting these characters [in Annabelle Comes Home], it’s like practicing your scales and doing a few arpeggios before having to deep dive into the next one. Because the next one is massive.’</p>
      <p>We are all kinds of excited.</p>
      <p>The real life Ed and Lorraine Warren have since passed, with Ed’s death in 2006 at the age of 79, while Lorraine died in April this year aged 92.</p>
