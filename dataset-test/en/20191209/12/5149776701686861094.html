      <h1>'Great player' - Nottingham Forest fans issue transfer statement after Jack Colback development</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Forest transfer news | Jack Colback's Newcastle future looks decidedly bleak as the winter transfer window edges closer, and Reds fans have been having their say</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:51:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest fans have been reacting to the rumour that <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/jack-colback-newcastle-united-transfers-3621952">Jack Colback’s contract at Newcastle United</a> could be terminated.</p>
      <p>Colback had two loan spells at the City Ground, where he made 55 appearances for the Reds.</p>
      <p>He returned to Newcastle in the summer, but was left out of Steve Bruce’s 25-man Premier League squad at St James’ Park.</p>
      <p>It had been expected <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-explore-alternative-options-2976125">Colback would return to the City Ground</a>, where he made himself a firm fans favourite, but following the arrival of Sabri Lamouchi the Reds opted against bringing the 28-year-old back to Nottingham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/jack-colback-reportedly-told-can-3185851">Colback</a>’s deal on Tyneside ends in the summer, and reports claim Newcastle could end his deal prematurely in a bid to free up valuable space on wage bill ahead of the transfer window opening.</p>
      <p>After the rumour surfaced, Forest fans have been having their say on whether they would welcome back the Reds’ former loan star.</p>
      <p>Here is a selection of what they had to say.</p>

      <p><b>Andy Draper:</b> “Would welcome him back, great player.”</p>
      <p><b>James Stringer:</b> “He won’t be coming here, more likely to go back to Sunderland!”</p>
      <p><b>Forestkev:</b> “They say never go back. I think we have better now.”</p>
      <p><b>Jamie Allen:</b> “So? Don’t need him.”</p>
      <p><b>Phil Jones:</b> “Class act. 100%.”</p>
      <p><b>Boanoite:</b> “Why on earth should anyone want Colback back now? Bostock and Mir may well return to their parent clubs but Colback is NOT needed-a striker, a goal scoring wide player and a goal scoring creative midfielder are all required, none of which describes Colback.”</p>
      <p><b>Mark Walden:</b> “We don’t need him!”</p>
