      <h1>If you thought HP was stopping deals after Cyber Week, think again</h1>

      <p>It’s pretty unbelievable how much amazing tech you can get during the weeks leading up to and right after Thanksgiving. Because, let’s be honest, while you’re spending time with your family, you’re also thinking about the fantastic gifts you’re able to get for all of them and yourself with the crazy amount of sales that are going on. But if you weren’t able to get everything you wanted to on Black Friday, Cyber Monday or during Cyber Week, HP wants you to know that they have a whole new set of deals to get you through the holiday season.</p>
      <p>During their Green Monday promotion, the deals are targeted specifically to help you save some green. The fantastic options that are offered are helping you finish out your shopping, because you’re going to need some time to wrap those presents once you get them. You’ll be able to get some of your favorite devices and electronics for as much as 63% off during this event! We were shocked by the amount of savings HP is still handing out.</p>
      <p>For those in the market for a premium laptop that has super fast processing and amazing graphics, then you’ll want to check out the <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;awinaffid=299513&amp;p=https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-14z-laptop-3un17av-1">HP Laptop 14-z</a>. For a limited time only, you’ll be able to get this for only $170, saving you $160! It runs on Windows 10 Home 64 and has a 14″ diagonal HD display. This machine boasts an AMD Dual-Core E2-9000e processor and features unreal clarity with the AMD Radeon™ R2 Graphics. It has 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of eMMC storage, meaning you’ll use this laptop for a long time. A Microsoft© Office software trial is provided and you’ll be able to save $20 instantly if you sign up for a year. You’ll have the choice of setting up a McAfee LiveSafe™ Security Software for up to three years and receive up to nearly $150 in savings. You’ll also be able to customize it in other ways, such as choosing its color between Jet Black, Snow White, Natural Silver, Pale Gold, Smoke Gray, Scarlet Red and Twilight Blue.</p>
      <p>But if you’re not looking for laptop and are, instead, searching for a PC, then the <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;awinaffid=299513&amp;p=https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-slimline-desktop-290-a0035z">HP Slimline Desktop-290-a0035z</a> should be your first stop. Right now, you’ll be saving almost $120 by nabbing this for just $233! This also runs on Windows 10 Home 64, providing you with a friendly and easy-to-use system. It features an AMD Dual-Core A-Series processor and AMD Radeon™ R4 Graphics for some truly impressive viewing potential. You’ll receive 1 TB of HDD storage and 4 GB of memory, as well as a DVD writer, so you can watch the movies you want to watch. There are tons of ports and it supports dual monitors, so this desktop is ready to connect you to anything you need. Its sleek and narrow design isn’t meant to take up your whole desktop, giving you plenty of room for those monitors.</p>
      <p>HP offers no cost shipping and easy returns, so it doesn’t hurt you to give something a try. They also offer price matching, meaning if you find one of their devices at a better price somewhere else, you’ll be able to get it from them at that price. You can completely customize either of these computers or many of their other stellar products that you can choose from during this event. But it only lasts until the end of December 9, or until supplies last, so if you’re at all thinking about picking up any of these, you need to do it ASAP. Put a bow on your early shopping for the year with HP.</p>
