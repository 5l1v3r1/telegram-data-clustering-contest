      <p>A woman is fighting for her life after she was set on fire by an intruder who tried to rape her in her home.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old victim suffered 50 per cent burns after she was doused with kerosene and set alight at her home in Bihar, east India, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>She was taken to a hospital in Muzaffarpur by her mum who had rushed home from work after being told about the horrific incident, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/woman-set-on-fire-in-bihar-after-failed-rape-bid/articleshow/72434367.cms">Times of India</a> reports.</p>
      <p>A man, who is reported to be a neighbour, has been arrested and is in custody at Ahiyapur police station.</p>
      <p>This latest rape-related incident in India is days after the charred bodies of two women were found in Buxar and Samastipur.</p>

      <p>Both women are believed to have been raped before being set on fire.</p>
      <p>On Saturday a gang rape victim who was set on fire as she made her way to court hearing in Uttar Pradesh died.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old woman had filed a complaint with police in March alleging she had been raped at gunpoint on December 12, 2018.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the rape victim was seized by five men, including the two people she had named in her complaint, and beaten, stabbed and set on fire.</p>
      <p>In India, lengthy trials, often a result of fewer courts and judges, tend to delay convictions, leaving poor, disillusioned victims with little money and patience to pursue the case.</p>
      <p>Also, long trials result in bails to the accused who often intimidate victims and their witnesses, and try tampering with evidence.</p>

      <p>On Friday, Indian police shot dead four men who were suspected of raping and killing a 27-year-old veterinarian near Hyderabad city, drawing applause from across the country angry over violence against women.</p>
      <p>But many were also concerned that police had over reached in shooting the alleged suspects without any trial.</p>
      <p>A Bollywood filmmaker sparked anger last week by saying rape  "without violence" should be legalised in India and women should carry condoms with them.</p>

      <p>Daniel Shravan also said if men had their sexual desire fulfilled they wouldn't kill women in an outrageous <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post which has been widely condemned on social media.</p>
      <p>Shravan said in his now deleted post that "the government should legalise rape without violence for the safety of women".</p>
      <p>The Bollywood director posted his views after Priyanka Reddy was raped and murdered by four men in Hyderbad two weeks ago                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     .</p>
      <p>The charred body of the 27-year-old vet, who was attacked after her scooter broke down, was found under a motorway overpass.</p>

      <p>Protests to end what has been described as a "rape culture" have taken place in India lately.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators have held placards in support of rape victims across the country.</p>
      <p>The number of rapes recorded in India is almost 40,000 each year, according to official figures. </p>
      <p>But campaigners say the real number is higher, with victims wary of filing cases because of the social stigma and a lack of faith in investigators.</p>
