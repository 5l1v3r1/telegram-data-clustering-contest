      <h1>NFL coach hot seat tiers: Cowboys' Jason Garrett, Browns' Freddie Kitchens could be fired next</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:22:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author">Vinnie Iyer</a></address>
      <p>And then there were 30 NFL head coaches still holdingthe jobs they had going intothe 2019 season.</p>
      <p>The Redskins parted ways with <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/washington-redskins-coach-jay-gruden-fired-winless-start/ieybray7giad1enrag8fa5sw0">Jay Gruden</a> after their 0-5 start, andthe Panthersrelieved <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/panthers-fire-coach-ron-rivera/1hojuy87mfe4v121wl5wz57mcp">Ron Rivera</a> of his duties after theirfade to 5-7 and out of NFC playoff contention. But everyone knows they won't be last two coaches to go from the hot seat to being fired before or on "Black Monday."</p>
      <p>Last year, eight teams decided to replace their coaches either during or right after the season. Although it will be hard to reach thatnumber in 2019, current situations could make it close.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Here are all 30 non-interim NFL coaches rankedby by their level of discomfort, starting with those who have the least amount of job security.</p>
      <h3>NFL coaches with the hottest of hot seats</h3>
      <p><b>1. Pat Shurmur, Giants.</b> New York has lost eight consecutive games after a 2-2 start, and there's no sign that Shurmur'sspecialty (offense) has actually improved despitepromising pieces like rookie quarterback Daniel Jones. Yes, the Giants have had some key injuries(Saquon Barkley, Sterling Shepard, Evan Engram, Golden Tate, offensive line), including Jones' ankle sprain. But the team overall is getting worse, not better. The Giants should turn to someone else(<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/ron-rivera-landing-spots-2020-giants-browns/1eurx2xohjr5x1w8acpc9mxk26">Ron Rivera</a>) for progressovera third year of Shumur.</p>
      <p><b>2. Jason Garrett, Cowboys.</b> Jerry Jones has delivered quotes that resemble an emotional roller-coaster when comes to his long-time favorite Princeton man and former backup quarterback. He is trying to separate head from heart, and that's been difficult for Dallas' owner/general manager. At this point, with real Super Bowl aspirations going into 2019,it <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/jason-garrett-fired-cowboys-playoff-wins-contract-extension/rlb7te1hbmra1dihmc7h2qa6b">might not be enough</a> for the Cowboys to limp into the playoffs as champions of the weak NFC East. The pressure is on Garrett to win at least a game or twoin the postseason.</p>

        <figcaption>Freddie Kitchens</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>3. Freddie Kitchens, Browns.</b> Stop us if you've heard this before, but it's getting extremely hot around Kitchens. He keeps gas-lighting the burner underhim with stupid leadership decisions like the "Pittsburgh started it" T-shirt in advance of his team laying an egg in the most important game of the season. The Browns, now 5-7, once had the smell of freshly baked cookies straight from the oven. Now they are setting off smoke alarms, with Kitchens <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/freddie-kitchens-coach-browns-2020/1xbbmrn8vgowp1tmafu0lyxpdj">most responsible</a> for cooking up the disaster.</p>
      <p><b>4. Doug Marrone, Jaguars.</b> His team's free-fall has reached the point where some are pronouncing his name to sound likea synonym of idiot.The defense is going into the tank, and Jacksonvillecontinues to show lesslife with each passing week. Marrone'sfate was probably cemented by the ill-fated decision to go back to Nick Foles instead of sticking with the inspiring play of rookie sensation Gardner Minshew.</p>
      <p><b>5. Dan Quinn, Falcons.</b> DQ has done well to get his team to rally and play harder, marked by the good decision to give up control of the defensive play-calling and focus on motivation and leadership. The players love him, and team owner Arthur Blank knows it. That's why Quinn is getting a chance at a full-season evaluation. But this feels like it will end, and Quinn will land in a good spot elsewhere. It just no longer seems he is the right fit for these Falcons.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>NFL coaching seats getting warm</h3>
      <p><b>6. Matt Patricia, Lions.</b> He likely will be retained in 2020 even though hisdefense has been atrocious despite the big investments (Trey Flowers, Justin Coleman) that unit received in the offseason. The key offensive injuries to Matthew Stafford and Kerryon Johnson probably give Patricia a pass into Year 3.</p>
      <p><b>7. Anthony Lynn, Chargers.</b> The Chargers are back to losingfrustrating, close games, and part of the reason might be Lynn having stuck too long with interception machinePhilip Rivers — even with a capable starter for his offense, Tyrod Taylor, on the bench. Lynn isprobably leaning toward safe because of injuries and other issues. He also is coming off a 12-4 record in 2018.</p>
      <h3>NFL coaching seats cooling off</h3>
      <p><b>8. Adam Gase, Jets.</b> Christopher Johnson says the Jets won't make a change despite Gase being a major disappointment, mainly because they don't want to admit the coach's hiring was a mistake. Regardless, he is being saved by an improving offense and a more favorable second-half schedule.</p>

        <figcaption>Matt Nagy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>9. Matt Nagy, Bears.</b> He hasNFC North title equity from his rookie season, and his team might finish well enough for him to advance to Year 3.</p>
      <p><b>10. Vic Fangio, Broncos</b>. His defense is starting to play better, and the quarterback carousel mess gives him a bit of pass. He is nowlikely to see a second year under John Elway.</p>
      <h3>NFL coaching seats that have gone cold</h3>
      <p><b>11. Kliff Kingsbury, Cardinals.</b> He has had more lows than highs (as expected) in his transition from the college game to the NFL, but he was the right hire with Kyler Murray in mind.</p>
      <p><b>12. Zac Taylor, Bengals.</b> He will end his rookie season with at least one win, and his team is playing better overall. He will get second year, this time with his franchise QB of choice.</p>
      <p><b>13. Brian Flores, Dolphins.</b> No one is talking about Miami tanking anymore, and he is proving he can be a keeper given bettertalent on the field.</p>
      <p><b>14. Jon Gruden, Raiders</b>. They're paying him too much to make a move, and he has overachieved with the Raiders enough to be fine through the team's move to Las Vegas.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>NFL coaches who are just chilling</h3>
      <p><b>15. Bruce Arians, Buccaneers.</b> He has gotten them to play much better, setting them up for real promise in 2020.</p>
      <p><b>16. Mike Vrabel, Titans.</b> He saved his job (and his team's season) with the Ryan Tannehill decision.</p>
      <p><b>17. Frank Reich, Colts.</b> He is doing his best with a rash of injuries after his great job in 2018.</p>
      <p><b>18. Doug Pederson, Eagles.</b> He still has plenty of Super Bowl equity.</p>
      <p><b>19. Mike Zimmer, Vikings.</b> He needed this current playoff run with Kirk Cousins.</p>
      <p><b>20. Bill O'Brien, Texans.</b>He is having one of his best seasons leading the team.</p>

        <figcaption>Matt LaFleur</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>21. Matt LaFleur, Packers.</b> He should get plenty coach of the year love.</p>
      <p><b>22. Kyle Shanahan, 49ers.</b> He should get plenty coach of the year love.</p>
      <p><b>23. Sean McDermott, Bills</b>. He needs more coach of the year love.</p>
      <p><b>24. Sean McVay, Rams.</b> He is still the football savant.</p>
      <p><b>25. Pete Carroll, Seahawks.</b> Somehow, he keeps looking 68 years young.</p>
      <p><b>26. Andy Reid, Chiefs.</b> All he does is coach great offense and get teams tothe playoffs.</p>
      <p><b>27. Sean Payton, Saints.</b> Sorry, Jerry, but he is staying in the Big Easy as long he wants.</p>
      <p><b>28. Mike Tomlin, Steelers.</b> He has done a masterful job with motivation and, as he would say, "things of that nature."</p>
      <p><b>29. John Harbaugh, Ravens.</b> And to think they wanted to fire him just a couple of years ago.</p>
      <p><b>30. Bill Belichick, Patriots.</b> GOAT coach. Wears a hoodie. Wins a lot. Doesn't say much.</p>
