      <p>An aristocrat and his estranged wife who disagree over where they should stage a fight over money have begun the latest round of an Anglo-Scottish legal battle which has spanned more than four years.</p>
      <p>Five Supreme Court justices began analysing the dispute between Charles Villiers and Emma Villiers at a hearing in London on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mr and Mrs Villiers, who lived near Dumbarton and separated 18 years after marrying, are divorcing in Scotland.</p>
      <p>But they disagree over whether arguments over money should be heard in an English or Scottish court.</p>
      <p>Mr Villiers, 56, says because divorce proceedings are taking place in Scotland any fight over money should also be staged in Scotland.</p>
      <p>His wife, who now lives in England, disagrees.</p>
      <p>A judge based in the Family Division of the High Court in London initially considered the case.</p>
      <p>Mrs Justice Parker, who began analysing arguments in 2015, said any fight over the division of assets should take place in England.</p>
      <p>In 2018, three Court of Appeal judges in London upheld that decision and dismissed an appeal by Mr Villiers.</p>
      <p>They said divorce proceedings in Scotland and a money fight in England were not “related actions”.</p>
      <p>Mr Villiers then asked Supreme Court justices to consider the case.</p>
      <p>Five Supreme Court justices are due to hear arguments from lawyers representing Mr and Mrs Villiers and the Ministry of Justice over two days.</p>
      <p>They are expected to publish a ruling next year.</p>
      <p>Mr and Mrs Villiers are listed on the website www.thepeerage.com.</p>
      <p>The website provides a “genealogical survey” of the peerage in Britain.</p>
      <p>Lawyers representing Mr Villiers say he is a relative of the Duchess of Cornwall.</p>
