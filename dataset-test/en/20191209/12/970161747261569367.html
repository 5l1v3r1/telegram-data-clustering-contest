      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! winner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> has caused huge upset with bookmakers who have branded her victory ‘one of the worst results in the history of reality TV betting’.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actress beat favourite Andy Whyment at the final hurdle, despite the Corrie star sailing ahead with the bookies’ odds.</p>
      <p>Andy walked into the final with odds of 2-7 while Jacqueline trailed behind on 4-1. When the series launched last month, the mum-of-two was a wild outsider with Coral putting odds of just 16-1 on the Lauren Branning actress.</p>

      <p>‘We thought the final had an air of inevitability about it and fully expected Andrew to be crowned King of the Jungle,’ explained Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead. ‘Punters clearly knew more than us though and Jacqueline’s win saw hundreds of Coral customers celebrating a nice early Christmas bonus.’</p>
      <p>‘We never really thought she had a chance and that’s why her odds remained so good, even in the latter stages of the series, and punters really cashed in.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘It just goes to show that it’s never over until it’s over and you can’t underestimate the power of the public vote.’</p>

      <p>Jacqueline has become the first I’m A Celebrity winner to cancel all live TV interviews after her triumph following rumours her husband Dan Osborne enjoyed a threesome with his Celebrity Big Brother housemates Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling, which he’s since shut down.</p>
      <p>It was also reported the former Towie star spoke to Jacqueline in unaired scenes to deny accusations he cheated on her with Myles Stephenson’s ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>During her exit interview with Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, Jacqueline explained she didn’t want to be seen as a ‘doormat’ and hoped she’d managed to change public perception of herself.</p>
