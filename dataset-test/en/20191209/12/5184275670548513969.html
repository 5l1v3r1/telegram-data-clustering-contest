      <h2>After Mirzapur and Made In Heaven's success, Amazon Prime Video is coming up with new series titled as 'Hostel Daze'.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:57:31+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">Koimoi.com Team</a></address>
      <p>After <i>Mirzapur</i> and <i>Made In Heaven</i>‘s success, Amazon Prime Video is coming up with new series titled as ‘<i>Hostel Daze</i>‘. They have just released the trailer and it’s garnering praises from all around. The trailer will definitely make you feel nostalgic and you would want to go back to your college life.</p>
      <p>Here’s the character synopsis of <i>Hostel Daze</i>:</p>
      <p>1) Ankit</p>
      <p>A quintessential boy next door, Ankit Pandey has normal looks, average body and ordinary grades. The only thing extra-ordinary about him are his love for the college-sweetheart and his dedication to porn.</p>
      <p>2) Jaat</p>
      <p>Patriarchy, bro-code and brutal honesty are the mantras this Haryanavi swears by. His stellar athletic capabilities more than compensate for an otherwise dire lack of sophistication. He owes his admission in college to management quota and hectares of farm land.</p>
      <p>3) Chirag</p>
      <p>Soft, chubby, cuddly and warm, Chirag Bansal is literally a human teddy bear. Being systematic, smart and caring makes him ‘Mummy’ of the wing. His innocence and uprightness is but a huge liability in this mad-house of a hostel.</p>

      <p>Recipe to make a Jhantoo</p>
      <p>1. Pour equal proportions of body odour, mess dues and backlogs in a hostel.</p>
      <p>2. Add a tinge of arrogance and manipulation.</p>
      <p>3. Boil hard under sexually-frustrating conditions.</p>
      <p>You get your Jhantoo! Best served with cigarettes.</p>
