      <h1>‘Oral sex is a very dirty thing to do’ — Babcock VC speaks on viral video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:58:42+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author">James Ojo</a></address>
      <p><b>Ademola Tayo, the vice-chancellor of Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, has described the recent viral sex video involving two former students of the institution as dirty</b>.</p>
      <p>Tayo was addressing journalists at the university’s guest house on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“It is not normal for a young woman to take the manhood of the man and be swallowing. That is a very dirty thing which supposed not to be heard,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We had to take that decision in order to protect this institution and to protect its alumni.  Because anywhere they go they say the university where they are all prostitutes.</p>
      <p>“They said the girls are always swallowing and all kinds of ridicule. If we keep mute, in the public opinion they would think that anything goes in the institution. We had to make a statement to show discipline.</p>
      <p>“But I need to tell you that I signed it off with tears in my eyes as a responsible father. But we are not leaving this young lady to her doom. The pastor called me last week and I prayed with the family. The father called me and said pray with your daughter.  I said she is still my daughter. Sometimes discipline is therapeutic.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to a time when this young girl would graduate and be celebrated. It may not be here; I don’t know where but we are not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.”</p>
      <p>The vice-chancellor urged members of the public to focus on the institution’s positive achievements.</p>
      <p>Babcock recently battled bad press after a sex tape of some student went <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/reactions-trail-leaked-sex-tape-of-babcock-students/"><b>viral.</b></a></p>
      <p>Both students were expelled by the <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/the-boy-was-expelled-in-february-babcock-speaks-on-students-in-leaked-sex-tape/"><b>management.</b></a></p>
