      <p>Dier had fallen out of favour under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> in his last few months as manager, but has seen a return to form and action since Mourinho joined the club.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game on Saturday, Dier told reporters: "We have spoken a lot â€“ both in English and Portuguese! His mentality appeals to me and it is very special.</p>
      <p>"It is natural that we have that connection but it is nothing more than that and up to me to perform. I know that if I do perform, like I know I can, I will be able to play."</p>
      <p>Spurs have won four out of five matches since the former Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid manager arrived, scoring 16 goals.</p>
