      <p>While policy-makers and activists gathered in Madrid for the second week of COP25 - the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - various protests continued around Europe.</p>
      <p>In the Spanish capital, dozens of Extinction Rebellion demonstrators marched through the main streets with a handmade whale skeleton to demand better protection of the oceans.</p>
      <p>In Brussels, thousands formed a human chain which encircled the Belgian federal parliament and the Royal Palace.</p>
      <p>Marleen De Vry said she was demonstrating to support younger generations:</p>
      <p>"I'm with 'Grandparents For The Climate' and for about one year now, we've been supporting the youngsters who’ve been demonstrating on the streets for the climate.</p>
      <p>“Many people laughed at them and didn’t take them seriously, but we did.</p>
      <p>“So we came here to support them from the very beginning and we're still here."</p>
      <p>In the UK, climate change activists blocked roads leading to Heathrow airport. The action was a protest against plans to build a new runway. There are fears of worsening air quality and increased noise pollution.</p>
      <p>And in Paris, French activists held portraits of President Emmanuel Macron upside down, calling for bolder government action at the climate talks.</p>
      <p>It comes as France remains behind its European neighbours in its use of renewable energy.</p>
