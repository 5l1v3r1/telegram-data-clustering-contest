    <meta property="og:description" content="Move over, Mayor Pete! There's a new Democratic presidential challenger in the music game. Sunday marked 39 years since John Lennon's death. To commemorate the anniversary, Tulsi Gabbard — the 38-year-old veteran and Congressperson from Hawaii, who has been a contentious presence in the Democratic primary campaign, most famously when Hillary Clinton accused her of being a Russian asset, — posted footage of herself and husband Abraham Williams singing Lennon's signature song, &quot;Imagine.&quot; Gabbard's version of the famous piano ballad recasts it as a ukulele lope. Musically it's nothing special, but it's still very interesting to see an American presidential candidate singing a song about abolishing all borders, to say nothing of the first practicing Hindu in Congress extolling the virtues of a religion-free secular humanist utopia. You can watch it below. Imagine. #johnlennon #imagine #beatles @johnlennon pic.twitter.com/yEoTy8vA6Q— Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) December 8, 2019"/>
