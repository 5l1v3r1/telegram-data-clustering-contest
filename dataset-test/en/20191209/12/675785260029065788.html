      <h1>WWE star Sami Zayn stands up to 'homophobic moron' in heated altercation</h1>
      <h2>The SmackDown star was performing at a WWE house show in Daytona Beach, Florida when a row broke out on Sunday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:33:04+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Docking, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-docking/</a></address>
      <p>This is the moment WWE star Sami Zayn confronted a hostile fan after he allegedly hurled homophobic slurs at him.</p>
      <p>The SmackDown star was performing at a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wwe">WWE</a> house show in Daytona Beach, Florida when a row broke out on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>According to witnesses, the abusive spectator was repeatedly calling the 35-year-old wrestler a "Canadian f****t".</p>
      <p>Zayn, real name Rami Sebei, whose parents are both Syrian, is known for being vocal about politics and social affairs.</p>
      <p>And he wasn't standing for any abuse as he screamed back at the man, recorded in a number of videos by other fans.</p>

      <p>The former NXT Champion can be heard to call him a "homophobic moron" and request security to "get him out of my f***ing face".</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user John Betz, the spectator was eventually kicked out of the show for his alleged vile behaviour.</p>
      <p>He said: "There were kids sitting all around and to be acting like a full blown a**hole was not cool.</p>

      <p>"Sami did the right thing by giving the guy 1 quick moment to shut up, he chose not to.</p>
      <p>"It's not hard to not be racist, sexist or homophobic at a wrestling show."</p>
      <p>The incident is said to have left a sour taste in the mouth of all who witnessed it, yet it appears Zayn showed admirable restraint.</p>
      <p>And he reportedly had the last laugh, strolling past and joking: "Hey, is this seat empty now? What happened?"</p>
      <p>As well as being a top class wrestler and a former darling of the independent scene, Zayn spearheads his own charity.</p>
      <p>In July 2017, he set up a fund called Sami for Syria to support the Syrian American Medical Society.</p>
