      <p>Iraqi security and health officials said unidentified gunmen fired shots at protesters at the Khilani square in <b>Baghdad</b>, killing 15 people and injuring dozens, the Associated Press reported. At least two of those <b>killed</b> are police officers.</p>
      <p>The sources wished to remain anonymous.</p>
      <p>Protesters fled to nearby Tahrir Square and mosques to hide from the attackers. The attack comes a day after 13 people were injured in a series of suspected knife attacks in Tahrir Square.</p>
      <p>Supreme Iraqi Shiite cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani today called for a new government to be formed within the timeframe and without outside intervention. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned last week. There is a 15-day deadline for parliament to nominate a new prime minister.</p>
      <p>Al Sistani said Shiite clerics would not participate in the government formation process.</p>
