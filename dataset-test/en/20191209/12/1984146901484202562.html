      <h2>Julie Ann Greenwood's cats were found covered in fleas by RSPCA inspectors</h2>

      <p>A woman who claimed a sex change led to her neglecting her pets has been banned from keeping animals.</p>
      <p>Julie Ann Greenwood's cats, Sapphire and Starlight, were found covered in fleas by RSPCA inspectors.</p>
      <p>A court heard that one of the animals was almost bald due to alopecia.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, Stewart Haywood told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">North Tyneside Magistrates' Court </a>of Greenwood's "prolonged neglect".</p>
      <p>He said: "It would have taken months for the cats to get into the condition they were in.</p>
      <p>"The two cats were discovered by inspectors for the charity at her home in July, just months after her op."</p>
      <p>Greenwood, from Burn Closes Crescent, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a>, portrayed herself as a cat lover in court.</p>
      <p>She said she had tried to get treatment for her animals by buying a collar from Amazon.</p>
      <p>Pictures later released by the RSPCA showed Starlight's skin had scabbed due to the fleas.</p>

      <p>When challenged over their condition, Greenwood was said to have been abusive to inspectors.</p>
      <p>Defending her actions, Gerry Bass, mitigating, said: "I don't think she gave the best impression of herself that day as she was deeply upset."</p>
      <p>Following a sex change in April, it was claimed she "had taken her eyes off the ball" and allowed her beloved pets to suffer.</p>
      <p>Greenwood previously pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.</p>
      <p>Magistrates banned her from keeping animals for five years after graphic pictures of the cats' injuries were shown in court.</p>
      <p>They decided not to give her a community penalty after hearing how she suffered life-changing injuries while serving in the armed forces.</p>
      <p>"She was injured badly by a bomb in Sarajevo sometime in the 90s," said Mr Bass.</p>
      <p>"Over the years those injuries have got worse and she is now in a wheelchair."</p>
      <p>Her ordeal has left the 53-year-old with PTSD.</p>
      <p>A former security worker, she had to quit her job over 20 years ago due to her disability which left her on benefits.</p>
      <p>Mr Bass also told the court that Greenwood struggled following a divorce.</p>
      <p>It was claimed that when married, her partner had been able to do a lot of the physical work associated with keeping a pet.</p>
      <p>Mr Bass added: "When the relationship broke down she couldn't get around as easily and the money dwindled."</p>
      <p>Greenwood was ordered to pay £400 costs and was fined £120.</p>
      <p>She will have to repay the charity £5 a week from her benefits.</p>
