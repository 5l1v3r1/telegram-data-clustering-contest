      <h3>Georgia vs. Baylor three things to watch</h3>
      <h4>Response to conference championship losses</h4>
      <p>Both Georgia and Baylor entered conference championship weekend eyeing College Football Playoff berths. LSU dealt Georgia a 37-10 blowout loss in the SEC championship while Baylor suffered a 30-23 overtime defeat to Oklahoma in the Big 12 championship.</p>
      <h4>Baylor finishing when it matters</h4>
      <p>Though Baylor has been one of the top teams in the country throughout the year, the Bears lack a signature win and have crumbled in crunch time. Baylor <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/oklahoma-jalen-hurts-sooners-defense-comeback-baylor/zvjdt8e4g56c1hro8nns55kui">blew a 28-3 lead</a> vs. Oklahoma back in November and also held a 13-10 halftime lead over the Sooners in the Big 12 championship loss.</p>
      <h4>D'Andre Swift</h4>
      <p>Georgia's star running back had just two rushing attempts in the SEC championship loss to LSU following his shoulder injury against Georgia Tech the week prior. Swift has 1,216 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns on the season and his status for the Sugar Bowl will be a key storyline going forward.</p>
