      <h1>Patriots vs. Chiefs final score: Kansas City builds lead early, holds on for tight win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:14:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:14</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>Kansas City had just enough defensive strength to hand the Patriots their third loss in five games Sunday in Foxborough, only managing three points after halftime but still clinching the AFC West with a 23-16 win.</p>
      <p>The game prompted lengthy discussions of multiple missed calls by the referees. The most egregious wiped what should have been a New England touchdown off the board, and because coach Bill Belichick had already used all of his challenges, the referees couldn't correct the error.</p>

      <p>That touchdown would have cut Kansas City's lead to 23-19 (pending the extra point) early in the fourth quarter. Instead, after the field goal, the Patriots deficit remained at a touchdown, 23-16, and they couldn't find the end zone on their final two possessions. The Chiefs batted down a fourth-down pass from New England quarterback Tom Brady in the end zone with about a minute remaining to seal the win.</p>
      <p>Brady was 19-for-36 through the air, picking up 169 yards, throwing one touchdown and one pick.</p>
      <p>The Patriots scored a touchdown on the game's opening drive and then picked off Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes to on the following possession. But they didn't score again for the rest of the first half, while the Chiefs scored two touchdowns and two field goals to hold a 20-7 lead at the break.</p>
      <p>Mahomes finished 26-for-40 passing for 283 yards, one touchdown and one interception.</p>
      <p>A field goal to start the second half pushed that advantage to 23-7, and then Kansas City began to slip up. A blocked punt and fumble on consecutive possessions led to 10 New England points, and likely would've turned into 14, if not for the missed call.</p>
      <p>The win clinched the AFC West for the Chiefs (9-4), while the Patriots (10-3) couldn't further distance themselves from the second-place Bills (9-4).</p>

      <p><b>7:37 p.m.:</b> TURNOVER ON DOWNS, Patriots. Brady looks for Edelman in the end zone on fourth-and-3 from the 5, but his pass is broken up. Kansas City will kneel it out.</p>
      <p><b>7:31 p.m.:</b> Brady scrambles for a fourth-and-6 conversion. The Patriots are in the red zone.</p>
      <p><b>7:28 p.m.:</b> The Patriots go into their bag of tricks late in the game.</p>

      <p><b>7:03 p.m.: FIELD GOAL, Patriots.</b> Well New England should have had a touchdown, but the referees ruled N'Keal Harry out of bounds when he wasn't, just before he dove for the pylon. Bill Belichick already used two challenges (one successful), so he couldn't ask for a review. Rough stuff. <b>Chiefs 23, Patriots 16.</b></p>

      <p><b>6:54 p.m.:</b> It's coming apart a bit for the Chiefs. Kelce fumbles, and New England recovers. May have been a long return if not for the referees initially ruling Kelce was down.</p>
      <p><b>6:39 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, Patriots.</b> Brandon Bolden from 10 yards out. Two-point conversion no good, as the Chiefs stuff a run. <b>Chiefs 23, Patriots 13.</b></p>

      <p><b>6:36 p.m.:</b> BLOCKED PUNT, Patriots. One play after failing to pick up a fumble, New England gets the momentum play it needed. If Nate Ebner hadn't blocked it, Justin Bethel would have. Atrocious protection from the Chiefs.</p>

      <p><b>5:22 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, Chiefs.</b> Out of the wildcat, Travis Kelce takes the direct snap and keeps it on the option. He's in from 4 yards, and Kansas City takes advantage of the short field. <b>Chiefs 17, Patriots 7.</b></p>

      <p><b>4:49 p.m.: FIELD GOAL, Chiefs.</b> After a New England three-and-out, the Chiefs string a nice drive together, mostly with three completions by Mahomes. They stall on a third-and-2, though, and Harrison Butker is good from 48. <b>Patriots 7, Chiefs 3.</b></p>
      <p><b>4:36 p.m.:</b> INTERCEPTION, Patriots. Patrick Mahomes makes a bad decision, and J.C. Jackson picks it off. Bad start for the reigning MVP.</p>
