        <b>Russia has been banned from all global sport for four years, including the 2020 Olympics, by the World Anti-Doping Agency.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The move also means the Russian team will be banned from taking part in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>But the country does have the right to appeal.</p>
      <p>Athletes who are able to prove they are not tainted by the doping scandal will be able to compete under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>The anti doping agency's executive committee made a unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on Monday.</p>
      <p>The decision comes after Russia's Anti Doping Agency was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.</p>
