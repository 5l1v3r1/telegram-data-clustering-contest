      <h1>Novak Djokovic Fools Fans With "We Are The Champions" Piano Performance. Watch Video</h1>
      <h2>Novak Djokovic is not one to shy away from a new challenge, though this one was a little bit of a twist.</h2>

      <p>Novak Djokovic, with 16 Grand Slams to his name, is a man of many talents. He recently sent fans wild with <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/novak-djokovics-pocket-trick-with-ball-sends-fans-wild-in-stadium-watch-video-2134409">his pocket trick</a> during a practice session during the Davis Cup in November. Now, in a video tweeted on Monday, Djokovic can be seen on the piano, apparently dishing out a beautiful rendition of the Queen classic 'We Are The Champions'. The tennis ace even starts singing along at the chorus. But, as the camera pans, it is seen that a woman is actually the one playing the song on another piano.</p>
      <p>The woman in the video is the Uzbek-American pianist Lola Astonova.</p>
      <p>As the piece ends, Astonova turns to Djokovic and says, "Well done, student", to which Djokovic responds "Thank you, professor" as the two of them break into laughter.</p>
      <p>Watch Djokovic's 'performance' here:</p>

      <p>The video of Djokovic attempting to mimic Freddie Mercury with both mic and piano had fans in splits.</p>
      <p>"Ahem. Why the laughing face!?! Those vocals talents of Novak are out of this world!!!!" a user tweeted in jest.</p>
      <p>"The best at everything he does," wrote another.</p>
      <p>"Ahahahahahahah, he does not play. Even singing, he still has work to do," another amused user tweeted.</p>
      <p>The world no.2 Djokovic, who won the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2019, will be looking to retain the Australian Open, which will be the first major tournament of 2020.</p>
