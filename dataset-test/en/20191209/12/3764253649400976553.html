      <p>Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola showed how compassionate he is after offering Manchester United midfielder Fred some encouraging words after being racially abused in last weekend's city derby.</p>
      <p>A goal each from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial helped the Red Devils compound City's woes after going 14 points behind current table-toppers Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian was said to have been abused by a 41-year-old City fan - who denies he was being racist during the game.</p>

      <p>It would be recalled that Man City was almost signing ex-Shakhtar Donetsk man, before joining the Red Devils in a deal around £52 million in summer 2018</p>
      <p>Although, Fred did not see the abuse when it happened but he was dismayed when shown the footage in the dressing room.</p>
