      <h1>Chelsea flop Tiemoue Bakayoko forgets his own shirt number during Monaco match</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder is currently back on loan with the Ligue 1 side and had a comical moment during their 3-0 win over Amiens on Sunday</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> flop <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tiemoue-bakayoko">Tiemoue Bakayoko</a> endured a moment to forget for loan club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/as-monaco">Monaco</a> after the midfielder forgot his shirt number and thought he was being subbed off.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/france-football-team">France</a> international is currently back with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ligue-1">Ligue 1</a> outift on a season-long loan deal after struggling to make much of an impact at Stamford Bridge after joining in the summer of 2017.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old started for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leonardo-jardim">Leonardo Jardim's</a> men in their league encounter at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amiens-sc">Amiens</a> on Sunday and helped them move into a 3-0 lead by the 69th minute.</p>
      <p>With nine minutes remaining, Bakayoko believed he was being replaced by Jean-Kevin Agustin after looking across to see the number 14 on the fourth official's board.</p>

      <p>While that may have been Bakayoko's squad number during his first spell at the Stade Louis II, that jersey now belongs to Keita Balde with the Chelsea flop wearing six instead.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was left somewhat redfaced as he headed towards the touchline, only to be told by the fourth official it was in fact Balde being replaced.</p>
      <p>The France international was thankfully able to see the funny side of his mistake, laughing as he walked back towards the centre of the pitch.</p>

      <p>Monaco, though, were unwilling to let Bakayoko forget his blunder quickly with the French giants later uploading a clip of the incident to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>And the midfielder's team-mates also showed little mercy, with ex-Arsenal man Cesc Fabregas commenting under Monaco's post: "Only Baka could do something like that. I couldnâ€™t stop laughing. Love you bro."</p>

      <p>After failing to impress on loan at AC Milan last season, Bakayoko returned to Monaco in the summer on a temporary deal from Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has featured 10 times for the Monegasques in the league so far this term, with Jardim's men 11th in the table after 16 games.</p>
