        <b>Anthony Joshua finally overcame the midnight ghost of Andy Ruiz Jr, after reclaiming his WBO, WBC and IBF heavyweight titles in Saudi Arabia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Nigerian-born British fighter is now a two-time heavyweight champion, and the sixth man to win the title after losing it to the same opponent.</p>
      <p>But there are life lessons one can take away from Joshua's re-insurgence after receiving the beating of his life from the Mexican-American underdog back in June.</p>

      <p>Here are five lessons we can learn from Joshua's victory over Ruiz</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Slow and steady wins the race</b>
      </p>
      <p>Patience was key to how Joshua scored his points from the first round to the 12th and all the three judges scored the fight clearly in favour of the challenger.</p>
      <p>Joshua did not come out like a wounded lion, he left all the reputation (the king of knockouts) he built over the years behind and aimed for the prize in a humble manner which paid off.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. He understood the value of the three belts he lost in his first fight</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was hunger and desire in the eyes of the challenger who was once a champion and that really gave him the motivation to take the fight to another level.</p>
      <p>The beating of the first bout was still fresh in his memory with the way he moved around in the ring. It was not the enterprising Joshua we knew of but being champion again was all that mattered to him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. He approached the fight with another strategy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being the poster boy of the heavyweight division did not matter to Joshua at this time. In fact he lost the first fight trying to maintain his status and play to the gallery.</p>
      <p>Joshua applied the unusual hit and try-not-to-get-hit approach which went in his favour unlike his all-out attacking style.</p>

        <b>4. Joshua was the better fighter but never for once underestimated Ruiz</b>

      </p>
      <p>All Ruiz needed was to get into range and unleash his <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a> punches that floored Joshua thrice back in June at Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p>But he was kept at arms-length most times and got frustrated along the line which was part of the challenger's plans.</p>
      <p>Joshua fought like an underdog, he kept on holding when necessary and all he aimed at was to the gold around his waste again.</p>

      <p>
        <b>5. Ruiz was carried away with the success in the first fight</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ruiz has never earned six zero's in his career and beating Joshua last June saw him take home a whopping £5million.</p>
      <p>The undergo bought his dream house three SUV's and splashed the cash all around his home in Mexico. He also knew he will be made with £14m take home from the rematch - that caused a huge distraction.</p>
      <p>He weighed heavier than his first fight and forgot the massive stroke of luck that made him record one of the biggest upset in boxing. Ruiz may never get the opportunity to fight a champion again.</p>
