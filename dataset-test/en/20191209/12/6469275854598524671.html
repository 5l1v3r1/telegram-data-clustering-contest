      <p>The Scottish limit was reduced on December 5, 2014 from 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood to 50mg/100ml.</p>
      <p>The move left England, Wales and Northern Ireland with the highest drink drive limit in Europe, along with Malta.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"Drink drive limit should be zero. Get caught and you lose your licence permanently. Toughen up our laws and stop dilly dallying!"<br/><b>Paul Walsh</b></p>
      <p>"Zero levels, cuts out any confusion."<br/><b>Mikey Gregg</b></p>
      <p>"Drink drive limit should be zero, it should apply to all including members of the police force and everyone educated about how long it stays in your blood stream for."<br/><b>Elaine Webb</b></p>
      <p>"Zero tolerance."<br/><b>Annette Capstick</b></p>
      <p>"I don’t agree. Plenty of people go out for a meal and have a wine or a beer what’s the problem drink drivers will always be caught out eventually."<br/><b>Lee McDermott</b></p>
      <p>"The problem being that the drink driver has impaired abilities and reaction times and will end up killing an innocent motorist or pedestrian before they are ‘caught out’."<br/><b>Geoff Naylor</b></p>
      <p>"The problem is, we all react differently. If I had one glass of wine with a meal, I would feel quite drunk."<br/><b>Rebecca Burton</b></p>
      <p>"Scottish level? What’s that, 2ml of blood per 100ml of whiskey?"<br/><b>Michael Anthony</b></p>
      <p>"I agree. A number of years ago drove whilst under the influence, at the time I was too drunk to know what I was doing, however I received a two-year ban and a hefty fine, I was lucky, as I hadn’t affected any innocent people. My actions were disgusting drinking and driving, and anybody who does it should lose their license."<br/><b>Jade Hammond</b></p>
      <p>"Great comment , a lot of people would be too ashamed to be honest about their mistake , you’re the opposite. "<br/><b>Mark Fenerty</b></p>
      <p>"Don’t drink an drive there is absolutely no need to drive with any amount of alcohol in your system."<br/><b>Chris Brotherton</b></p>
      <p>"It can’t be zero as there are other sources besides a drink for alcohol to be in the system... Lowering the limit won’t affect the behaviors of those who blatantly disregard the current limits. Shocking driving standards in general are probably a bigger factor in accident rates than the amount of alcohol in offending drivers systems at or around the current limit."<br/><b>Darren James</b></p>
