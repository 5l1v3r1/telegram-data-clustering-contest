      <p>According to <i>Football Talent Scout information</i>, Ronaldo Jr. has incredible stats for his age.</p>
      <p>He has made just 28 appearances for the Juventus Under-9 team so far, but has already recorded 58 goals and 18 assists.</p>
      <p>However, earlier this year, Cristiano Ronaldo claimed that his son will struggle to be as good as him at football.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>beIN Sports</i> as reported by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7297998/cristiano-ronaldo-jr-cristiano-ronaldo-juventus-football/"><i>The Sun</i></a>, the 33-year-old Portuguese superstar and five-time Ballon d’Or winner said: “I hope that Cristiano can be like his father. He says he will be better than I, but I think it will be difficult.”</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old recently lost out on the race for the 2019 Ballon d’Or title, finishing third behind Lionel Messi who lifted the trophy for a record sixth time in his career, as Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk came second.</p>
