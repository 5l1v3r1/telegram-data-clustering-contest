      <p>The Ducks are making their eighth Rose Bowl appearance. Oregon has made the Rose Bowl four times this decade. Wisconsin is making its 10th Rose Bowl appearance. The Badgers also are making their fourth Rose Bowl appearance this decade. They have lost the previous three matchups.</p>

      <p>Sporting News will have Rose Bowl odds where they become available.</p>
      <h3>Oregon vs. Wisconsin three things to watch</h3>
      <h4>Jonathan Taylor</h4>
      <p>The Wisconsin running back ranks second in the FBS with 1,909 rushing yards. He has a chance to complete back-to-back 2,000-yard seasons in a bowl where program legend Ron Dayne was a two-time MVP. It's a fitting finish for Taylor's career should he decide to turn pro after the game.</p>
      <h4>Justin Herbert</h4>
      <p>Herbert has one last chance to impress NFL scouts at the college level. The Oregon quarterback had success against the Utes in the Pac-12 championship game, but Wisconsin has a tough pass defense (191.2 yards per game). Herbert (3,333 yards, 32 touchdowns, five interceptions) will let it loose here, too.</p>
      <h4>Conference pride</h4>
      <p>"The Granddaddy of Them All" is always better when it features members of these two conferences, which have become scattered in the College Football Playoff era. The Pac-12 has a 4-3 advantage this decade. The Badgers have a chance to even the score in what should be a fun matchup given the contrast in styles.</p>
