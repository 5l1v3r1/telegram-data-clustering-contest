      <p>Somehow the driver escaped with minor injuries but the home was damaged. </p>

      <p>Viewers mocked the driver in the video and called for a tougher speed limit on the road.   </p>
      <p>Kelly Earlswood said: 'This is awful! How fast that car is going is ridiculous!' </p>
      <p>And Munir Choudhury joked: 'Sure the driver doesn’t live there? It was almost perfect parking tbh.'</p>
