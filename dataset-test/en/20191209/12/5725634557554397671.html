      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The British pound hit a 31-month high against the euro last week, presumably because the Conservatives maintain a healthy lead over Labour in this week’s elections.</li>
        <li>It’s understandable why investors don’t want Labour, which promises to nationalize much of the British economy and introduce a slew of different taxes.</li>
        <li>But why should the pound rally over the victory of a government that will finalize Brexit, the very reason the pound has crashed these past three-and-a-half years?</li>
        <li>Investors should just stay away from sterling-based assets altogether.</li>
      </ul>
