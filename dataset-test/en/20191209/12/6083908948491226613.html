      <h1>WATCH: A Small Act of Kindness Brightens an Amazon Worker's Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T12:30:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bethbaumann" target="_blank">Beth Baumann</a></address>
      <p>The Christmas season is one of the busiest – and arguably one of the most stressful – times for delivery drivers. Not only do they have a heavier workload, with more people shopping online for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but these drivers are also working in wet, snowy and icy conditions.</p>
      <p>Kathy Ouma, a woman in Middletown, Delaware, put out a box of drinks and snacks for her delivery drivers, along with a message: “Please take some goodies to enjoy on your route. Thanks for making holiday shopping easy.”</p>
      <p>Amazon driver Karim Reed III, who had only been on the job for three months, was elated when he saw the goodies.</p>
      <p>“Oh, this is nice!” he exclaimed. “They got some goodies. Wow.”</p>
      <p>After he picked out his snacks and went back on his way, Reed did his "signature dance," which he's been doing since he was seven. He was excited because he had forgotten to pack a lunch that day and the snacks held him over until he got home. </p>
      <p>Ouma caught the entire ordeal on her doorbell camera. She said she could hear him outside because she was inside recovering from a recent car accident, <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/12/07/doorbell-camera-captured-amazon-driver-performing-signature-dance-after-finding-treats-on-porch/">WITI-TV</a> reported.</p>
      <p>“I heard his infectious energy outside. He really did make my day. I thought, ‘I am all better,'" she said. “If I had known, I’d have left him lunch too."</p>
      <p>Videos like this are a great reminder that sometimes we all need to slow down, take a deep breath and appreciate those in our lives that do nice things for us. A small act of kindness can really, truly make a person's day better. </p>
