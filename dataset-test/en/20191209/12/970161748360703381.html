      <p>Ruth Langsford and Phillip Schofield’s on-air spat back in April has resurfaced amid reports the Loose Women star has filed a complaint against the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> presenter.</p>
      <p>The pair were seen clashing in an awkward encounter during a chat between the two studios, in a This Morning segment live connection revealing what was happening later on This Morning.</p>
      <p>While it started off OK, with Ruth as the head of the panel of the daily chat show, things soon went awry when Phil cut her off and said: ‘Guys, we are going to have to jump in there and stop you I’m afraid.’</p>
      <p>‘We are a bit tight for time on this end,’ he added. ‘Thank you, Ruth. We will catch you guys a little bit later.’</p>
      <p>Ruth can be seen throwing her pen across the desk with a massive sigh, before being heard responding: ‘Well I only had about two more words to say… don’t worry.’</p>
      <p>Rumours that the pair have been arguing backstage has risen to the surface this weekend amid reports that Ruth has filed a complaint against Phillip – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/07/multiple-morning-presenters-complain-phillip-schofields-attitude-11389889/">others have spoken out against him too</a>.</p>
      <p>The reports that Phillip had become difficult to work with included a ‘well-known name’ that remained anonymous, and a claim that even his close bond with Holly Willoughby had hit a rough patch.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10499882/phillip-schofield-holly-ruth-this-morning-war/">The Sun</a> claims the name told them: ‘For so long people have been silenced because they are scared for their job.</p>
      <p>‘If they speak out publicly about the atmosphere they fear there could be repercussions.’</p>
      <p>However, the complaints went ignored on Monday’s episode of This Morning, despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/piers-morgan-takes-savage-swipe-phillip-schofield-civil-war-mornings-happy-family-11413758/">even Good Morning Britain taking a swipe at their ITV Morning rivals</a> and mocking their ‘family’ persona.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for ITV said: ‘It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.</p>
      <p>‘Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise. Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike.’</p>
