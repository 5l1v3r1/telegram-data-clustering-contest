        <b>Five people have been confirmed dead after a volcano erupted in New Zealand off the coast of the Bay of Plenty. A rescue effort has been launched amid reports that around 50 people may have been on or near the island.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>“At this stage, it is too dangerous for police and rescue to go onto the island… [It] is currently covered in ash and volcanic material,”</i> Deputy Commissioner of Police John Tims told reporters. Police later confirmed five people have died.</p>
