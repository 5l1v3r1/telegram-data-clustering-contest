      <p>In a major infrastructure and connectivity boost for the rising city of Surat in the State of Gujarat, the construction of the first phase of a 40.35 kilometer long metro rail network is set to begin in June 2020, which will thereafter be completed within a span of four years, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/infrastructure/work-on-40-km-surat-metro-to-begin-in-june-next-year-gujarat-government-11575815984630.html">reports </a><i>Livemint</i>.</p>
      <p>The first phase in total will witness the erection of two routes between Sarthana and Dream City, and between Bhesan and Saroli with each comprising of 14 and 18 elevated stations, respectively.</p>
      <p>The project gained momentum in February this year when the Government of India approved the request made by government of Gujarat for an amount of Rs 12,020.32 crore to implement the project.</p>
      <p>The project's design work is presently on with the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) spearheading the job, while tendering for the project is expected to be issued soon. On Sunday (8 December) Chief Minister (CM) Vijay Rupani had also held a review meeting on the progress made.</p>
