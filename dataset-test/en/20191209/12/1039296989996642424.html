      <p>Yamaha's BS6-compliant R15 V3.0 sees a Rs 4,400 increase in price compared to the BS4 model.</p>
      <p>Exactly a month after <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/bs6-compliant-yamaha-fz-fz-s-launched-from-rs-99200-414838">Yamaha launched its first BS6-compliant two-wheelers – the FZ and FZ-S</a></b> – the manufacturer has launched the BS6-compliant iteration of the popular R15 V3.0. Prices for the updated bikes start at Rs 1.45 lakh, which is a hike of just Rs 4,400 over the BS4 model.</p>
      <p>The switch to BS6, however, has brought with it a slight drop in power. While the 155cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine on the BS4 version produced 19.3hp at 10,000 rpm and 14.7Nm at 8,500 rpm, this new model produces 18.6hp and 14.1Nm at similar points in the rev range.</p>
      <p>The new YZF-R15 V3.0 will be available in three colours – Racing Blue (Rs 1.46 lakh), Thunder Grey (Rs 1.45 lakh) and Darknight (Rs 1.47 lakh). Interestingly, the Racing Blue variant will get blue-coloured wheels, as seen on the bike sold in Indonesia and other Asian markets. This also means we could see the BS6 iteration of the MT-15 receive its quirky wheel colours.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the launch, Motofumi Shitara, Chairman, Yamaha Motor India said, “With Yamaha continuing to perk up track performances with the R series, the new YZF-R15 Version 3.0 with BS6-compliant engine and new features will be able to create optimum excitement in India in its respective category. Yamaha strived for optimum cost control for the new version and achieved to peg it around 3 percent higher along with new standard features.”</p>
