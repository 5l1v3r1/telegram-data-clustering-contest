      <h1>Vote in the UK’s general election and you could win CoD: Modern Warfare and more</h1>

        <b>If you’ve been living under a rock on Mars with your fingers in your ears and your eyes shut and no phone signal, it might surprise you to learn the UK is holding its next general election this week, on Thursday, December 12. With just three days to go at the time of writing, games industry figures have joined calls to get gamers to vote in the poll.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Companies such as Bethesda, Activision, Ubisoft, and Frontier have backed the Gamechangers campaign, started by presenter and actor Elle Osili-Wood, which is focused on encouraging people to cast their vote. Anyone who tweets a picture of themselves, using the hashtag #GamechangersGiveaway, outside their polling station on Thursday will be entered into a prize draw for 200 games and plenty more prizes.</p>
      <p>“It’s never been more important to vote – it’s time to step up and be a gamechanger,” Osili-Wood told <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-09-industry-backed-campaign-encourages-gamers-to-vote">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. “With 85% of UK adults under 35 regularly playing video games, gamers are a significant demographic in the upcoming election, so I’m thrilled to see the games industry come together to get out the vote.”</p>

      <p>While people of all ages play games regularly, young people are especially likely to do so. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39965925">Voter turnout is traditionally low</a> among young people in the UK.</p>
      <p>Separate to the Gamechangers campaign, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a> developer House House recently pleaded with people to vote for Labour, prompting both positive and negative responses in the replies. Other developers and publishers have remained politically neutral.</p>
