      <h1>Russia banned from Olympics over doping scandal</h1>

      <p>Russia has been banned from participating in a full range of sporting events, including the upcoming 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup in Qatar, for four years on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled that it had manipulated laboratory data, a WADA spokesman said.<br/><br/>WADA's executive committee made the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs. The WADA committee's decision was unanimous, the spokesman said.<br/><br/>Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a leading sporting nation, has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.<br/><br/>Its doping woes have increased ever since, with many of its athletes sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year's Pyeongchang Winter Games as a punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.<br/><br/>Monday's sanctions had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.<br/><br/>One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.<br/><br/>The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation.<br/><br/>Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues.<br/><br/>The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.<br/><br/>Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.<br/><br/>If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA's executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.</p>
