      <p>The newly elected chairmen for the 21 local government councils of Adamawa State have been sworn in.</p>
      <p>The chairmen, whose victories were announced Sunday evening following council election that took place on Saturday, had their certificates of return issued to them Monday morning,.</p>
      <p>The ceremony at which they were sworn in took place at the Mahmud Ribadu Square in Yola later on Monday.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the ceremony, the state governor, Rt Hon Ahmadu Fintiri, charged them to deliver good governance to the people who voted them into office.</p>
      <p>He urged them not to be travelling chairmen but to stay back at their respective council areas and embrace everyone within their jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>The Executive Chairman of Michika Local Government, Hon Michael Shehu, who spoke on behalf of all the chairmen, thanked Adamawa people for electing them to serve.</p>
      <p>The oath of office was administered on the chairmen by the State Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice, Barr Afraimu Jingi.</p>

      <p>The council chairmen all emerged from the ruling PDP, according to the Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC) which conducted the election.</p>
      <p>Their election has generated much condemnation from the main opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) which called the election a sham and vowed to move against it.</p>
      <p>The party’s legal adviser, Mr Shagnah Pwamaddi, had said, “The recently conducted election is a complete sham, undemocratic and below standard of what we call election. This is selection that was perpetrated under intimidation and inducement. We are not going to accept it.”</p>
