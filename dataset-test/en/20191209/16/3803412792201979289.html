      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple's new Mac Pro has gone through FCC approval.</li>
        <li>That includes the standard and rack deployment versions.</li>
        <li>Orders begin on December 10.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Apple's new <a href="https://www.imore.com/mac-pro-2019-everything-you-need-know">Mac Pro</a> is just hours away from being ready for pre-order, and now the machine has also gone <a href="https://fccid.io/BCGA2304">through FCC approval</a> after it appeared on the online registry as spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/12/09/the-new-mac-pro-hits-the-fcc-ahead-of-launch/">9to5Mac</a>.</p>
      <p>That means that the Mac Pro can now be sold in the United States which is pretty important if you want to put it up for pre-order. We still don't really know when this thing will go on sale, though. Nor what built-to-order Mac Pros will look like in the old price department. But given the vast majority of Mac Pro buyers will be businesses or people who can write the cost off, that's likely not all that important to them.</p>

      <p>This is the first Mac Pro refresh we've seen since 2013 and it's a big one. This is nothing like the trash can design that failed so badly thanks to poor thermals. It's big, boxy, and looks like a Mac Pro should. And it has the innards to match, too.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it has a price to go with it. <a href="https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F159229%2F554233%2F7613%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU61105YYw%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fmac-pro%252F&amp;token=_--3tIKq">Starting at $5999</a> this isn't going to be a cheap computer. But if you need the best Mac available, and want to be able to expand it, this is it.</p>

I think so, and I'll tell you why Apple has been accused of scrimping on storage by continuing to sell a 64GB version of its flagship iPhones. But 64GB is plenty for me, and here's why I think it might be plenty for you, too.</a>
