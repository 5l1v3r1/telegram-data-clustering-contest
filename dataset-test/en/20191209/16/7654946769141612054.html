      <h1>Driver strikes mom and kid in East Harlem, killing 3-year-old boy</h1>

      <p>A 3-year-old boy in a stroller was killed and his mother was injured Monday when a pickup truck plowed into them in a crosswalk in East Harlem, cops said.</p>
      <p>A Ford F-250 driven by a 59-year-old man hit Bertin DeJesus near First Avenue and 116th Street about 9:35 a.m., police said.</p>
      <p>The child was pronounced dead at Metropolitan Hospital, where his 25-year-old mother was treated for minor injuries.</p>
      <p>“She’s in stable condition. (Bertin) took the brunt of the injuries,” said hospital spokesman Noah Alicea, who declined to describe the mom’s injuries.</p>
      <p>A worker at a neighborhood Dunkin’ Donuts said the woman is a regular customer who stopped by moments before the tragic accident.</p>

      <p>“She’s here every day, she ordered two bagels with cream cheese with her friend and hash browns for the baby this morning,” Marisol Medina, 51, told The Post. “They said goodbye to me. I said ‘Be careful’ in Spanish.”</p>
      <p>A short time later, “everyone was screaming,” Medina said.</p>
      <p>“When I came over to see, I saw her, she was on the floor holding the baby and screaming,” she said about the distraught mother, who was covered in blood and screaming, “Save my baby! Save my baby!”</p>
      <p>”I was destroyed. Not only do I see her all the time, she is one of my closest customers. She always ordered medium coffee with sugar,” Medina said, adding that the woman’s leg was injured.</p>

      <p>Medina said she doubts that the driver saw the woman crossing the street with her son.</p>
      <p>The unidentified driver, who remained at the scene, was taken into custody. He had been heading east on 116th Street when he made a left onto northbound First Avenue.</p>
      <p>A stroller with a rain shield remained in the middle of the intersection as police investigated the crash.</p>
      <p>Charges were pending against the driver, law enforcement sources told The Post.</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing as police seek to find out who had the right of way.</p>
