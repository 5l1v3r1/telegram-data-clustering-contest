      <h1>ASOS accused of 'laughing at plus size bodies' with ballerina fat suit game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:08:12+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Abernethy</a></address>
      <p>ASOS has removed a game where players are encouraged to play classic game charades in a blow-up Ballerina suit after a plus-size blogger accused them of ‘laughing at a body that looks like mine’.</p>
      <p>Danielle Vanier posted pictures from the ASOS website on Twitter and people weren’t impressed with the product.</p>
      <p>It features a blow-up suit, designed to make the player look larger while wearing a pink dress.</p>
      <p>The £30 game is made by Typo but was also being sold on the ASOS website in the UK.</p>
      <p>Kate Winney replied to Danielle: ‘As someone who’s danced and done ballet their entire life, it’s garbage like this that puts people off from joining in and taking a class! Dance is for EVERYBODY!!’</p>
      <p>Another user added: ‘No not ASOS as well. Why isn’t there one place we can go without feeling fear of being fat-shamed?’</p>
      <p>‘You sell clothes to bodies that are parodied in this way and have no problem taking our money. Hang your head in shame,’ someone else said, referring to their extensive Curve range.</p>

      <p>ASOS quickly replied to Danielle’s tweet and said that they had decided to withdraw the product from the site because of her concerns.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: ‘Thank you for making us aware of this. It was never our intention to cause offence, we’ve decided to remove the product from our site.</p>

      <p>‘As a responsible fashion retailer we’re aware of the importance of promoting positive body image, so we appreciate your feedback.’</p>
      <p>Danielle told her followers that she had been contacted by the team and she was glad they had said they would remove this product.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘ I feel like this is a really positive outcome and very happy for their prompt response.’</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for ASOS told Metro.co.uk: ‘We’re sorry this item caused offence, it was not our intention and we have removed the product from site.’</p>
      <p>The item was also for sale on the Typo website but is no longer available.</p>
