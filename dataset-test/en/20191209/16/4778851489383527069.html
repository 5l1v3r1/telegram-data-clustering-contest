        <b>More than 500 accidental house fires were recorded across Scotland during the festive season last year, according to new figures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 509 incidents were recorded between 10 December 2018 and 14 January 2019, with 91 casualties – 37 of whom were aged 60 or over.</p>
      <p>The figure is down slightly from the previous year – 528 incidents between 11 December 2017 and 15 January 2018 – but still higher than the 486 incidents recorded from 12 December 2016 to 16 January 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), the increase in house fires during the festive period is typically caused by a higher use of heating and electrical appliances.</p>
      <p>It added that increased alcohol consumption, decorations and the traditional use of candles can also play a part in raising the risk of fire.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Officer Ross Haggart, SFRS director of prevention and protection, said: “Ultimately, we want people to remember the festive period for all the right reasons.</p>
      <p>“When our firefighters have to attend a fire in someone’s house at Christmas time, and we enter a house which is burning but full of Christmas presents and decorations, it’s heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>“But, unfortunately, the festive period sees potentially deadly combinations come together – increased use of electricity, drinking alcohol and cooking, decorations being put up near heat sources.</p>
      <p>“It’s all too easy to think that it will never happen to you – but it can. That’s why we are appealing to communities across Scotland – don’t let Christmas end, or your new year start, with tragedy.”</p>
      <p>The figures were highlighted as the SFRS launched its winter safety campaign yesterday, including a national television advert highlighting the dangers of cooking while under the influence of alcohol.</p>
      <p>Mr Haggart added: “When it comes to celebrating, please do not drink, then attempt to cook. Cooking remains the number one cause of house fires in Scotland and often alcohol is a contributing factor, especially during this period.</p>
      <p>“Consider making something beforehand and have it prepared, or wait until you are no longer affected by alcohol.”</p>
      <p>Community safety minister Ash Denham said: “While we want people to be able to celebrate and relax over the festive period, it is extremely important that they also keep themselves and others safe.”</p>
