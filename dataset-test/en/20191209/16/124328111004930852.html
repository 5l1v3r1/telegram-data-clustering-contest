      <p>Obese children have a thinner region of their brain which is important for decision-making, according to a study.</p>
      <p>Brain scans of 3,000 nine and 10-year-olds revealed children who weigh too much for their height tend to have a thinner prefrontal cortex.</p>
      <p>The prefrontal cortex is part of the brain's outer layer and plays an 'integral' role in a person's ability to plan and control their behaviour.</p>
      <p>Overweight children in the study performed worse on tests which involved sorting through lists, which scientists suggested was because of this thinning.  </p>
      <p>They said the findings may indicate a catch-22 situation for overweight children.</p>
      <p>Obesity may be responsible for the smaller brain region, they said, but the smaller prefrontal cortex could also make the children less likely to decide to eat healthily. </p>
      <p>But the team were not able to prove whether obesity caused the thinner cortex, nor whether the opposite was true.  </p>

      </figure>
      <p>The University of Vermont team also recorded how the children’s BMI compared to peers of the same gender and age.</p>
      <p>For example, children in the bottom five per cent are considered underweight. While those in the top 15 per cent are deemed overweight.</p>
      <p>Results showed those with higher BMIs tended to have a thinner cortex, the outer layer of the brain where most information is processed.</p>
      <p>Eighteen different regions of the cortex – including the prefrontal cortex – were thinner in overweight children. Results did not specify how much thinner the brain region was.</p>
      <p>Youngsters were also asked to perform four different tasks, including one which involved sorting cards and another a list of words.</p>
      <p>The findings showed children with a high BMI performed worse on three of the tasks. Results were inconsistent for the flanker task.</p>
      <p>All three of the tasks are 'known to depend on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex', the researchers wrote in their paper.</p>
      <p>Further analysis confirmed a thin prefrontal cortex was largely to blame for the poor decision-making on the list-sorting task.</p>
      <p>However, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics was unable to prove a link between a thin prefrontal cortex and the results of the other two tests.</p>
      <p>But the experts wrote: ‘These results suggest BMI is associated with prefrontal cortex development and diminished executive functions, such as working memory.</p>

      <h3>WHAT IS OBESITY AND WHAT ARE ITS HEALTH RISKS? </h3>
      <p>Obesity is defined as an adult having a BMI of 30 or over.</p>
      <p>A healthy person's BMI - calculated by dividing weight in kg by height in metres, and the answer by the height again - is between 18.5 and 24.9. </p>
      <p>Among children, obesity is defined as being in the 95th percentile.</p>
      <p>Percentiles compare youngsters to others their same age. </p>
      <p>For example, if a three-month-old is in the 40th percentile for weight, that means that 40 per cent of three-month-olds weigh the same or less than that baby.</p>
      <p>Around 58 per cent of women and 68 per cent of men in the UK are overweight or obese. </p>
      <p>The condition costs the NHS around £6.1billion, out of its approximate £124.7 billion budget, every year.</p>
      <p>This is due to obesity increasing a person's risk of a number of life-threatening conditions.</p>
      <p>Such conditions include type 2 diabetes, which can cause kidney disease, blindness and even limb amputations.</p>
      <p>Research suggests that at least one in six hospital beds in the UK are taken up by a diabetes patient.</p>
      <p>Obesity also raises the risk of heart disease, which kills 315,000 people every year in the UK - making it the number one cause of death.</p>
      <p>Carrying dangerous amounts of weight has also been linked to 12 different cancers. </p>
      <p>This includes breast, which affects one in eight women at some point in their lives.</p>
      <p>Among children, research suggests that 70 per cent of obese youngsters have high blood pressure or raised cholesterol, which puts them at risk of heart disease.</p>
      <p>Obese children are also significantly more likely to become obese adults. </p>
      <p>And if children are overweight, their obesity in adulthood is often more severe.  </p>
      <p>As many as one in five children start school in the UK being overweight or obese, which rises to one in three by the time they turn 10.  </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>They added that ‘dysregulation of these cognitive functions could exacerbate poor decision-making with regard to diet’.</p>
      <p>This, Dr Jennifer Laurent and colleagues said, could even ‘contribute to negative health outcomes, including excessive weight gain’.</p>
      <p>The prefrontal cortex may be more vulnerable to obesity because it matures later than other parts of the brain, the researchers added.</p>
      <p>Figures suggest a third of children in the UK and US are overweight, which is known to raise the risk of type 2 and diabetes and heart disease.</p>
      <p>But concrete evidence that obesity impacts brain development is scarce, with several smaller studies yielding mixed results.</p>
      <p>Children were ruled out of the study if they had been born prematurely or with a low birth weight because they may have impaired brain development.</p>
      <p>And poor quality MRI scans were excluded, to allow the academics the most accurate images of the brains of the child volunteers.</p>
      <p>But the researchers admitted that it may not be a high BMI that causes a thinner prefrontal cortex, speculating insulin resistance could play a role. </p>
      <p>Obesity experts welcomed the study. Dr Laura Dearden, from the University of Cambridge, said the results are 'consistent' with other studies. </p>
      <p>She said changes in the structure of the prefrontal cortex 'could explain why some children find it harder to eat less' and therefore gain weight.</p>
      <p>But Dr Dearden warned it is not clear whether a thinner cortex causes weight gain or weight gain causes a thinner cortex.</p>
      <p>Professor Tara Spires-Jones, of the University of Edinburgh, said the research was 'interesting' and 'well-conducted'.  </p>
      <p>She added: 'This paper adds to a large amount of data suggesting that taking good care of your body is good for your brain.</p>
      <p>'But more work needs to be done to fully understand the observed association between smaller cortex size and high BMI.'</p>
      <p>Professor Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, described the paper as being 'provocative'. </p>
      <p>He added that other factors that cause children to be overweight, such as being from poorer backgrounds, may play a role. </p>
