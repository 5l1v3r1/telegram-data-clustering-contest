      <p>The factory, which made school bags and toys according to Indian media, was packed with combustible materials such as paper, plastic and cardboard, causing it to burn for hours before being brought under control.</p>

      <p>"We have arrested the owner and a manager of the factory where the fire broke out and initiated an investigation which is going to be completed soon," Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi police spokesman, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Most workers employed at the unit used to live in the factory itself, cooking meals there.</p>

      <p>Frequent raids by civic authorities to enforce building codes, fire safety measures and evacuation procedures have failed to curb violations in the rapidly expanding city of 20 million people.</p>

      <p>On Monday morning, more fire engines were dispatched to the factory to douse a small fire caused by burning waste.</p>
