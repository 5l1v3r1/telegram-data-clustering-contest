      <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/12/09/minecraft-players-on-ps4-join-bedrock-starting-tomorrow-enabling-cross-play/">Starting tomorrow</a>, installed versions of Minecraft on PlayStation 4 systems will update to the unified Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Connecting players across Xbox One, Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android mobile devices, Gear VR and now PS4, Minecraft is a connected world everywhere.</p>
      <p>PlayStation 4 players will now be able to access the Minecraft Marketplace, a unified storefront for skins and texture packs that transcends platform restrictions. If you buy a skin pack on Xbox One, you’ll own it on every platform.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/rumour-minecraft-bedrock-playstation-4-crossplay/">Minecraft: Bedrock Edition was first teased for PlayStation 4 a few days ago</a>. With images of physical copies of the unified title leaking on social media, complete with Playstation-capable Minecraft Token currency, it was inevitable that Bedrock Edition would come to PS4.</p>
      <p>Explore randomly generated worlds and build amazing things from the simplest of homes to the grandest of castles. Play in creative mode with unlimited resources or mine deep into the world in survival mode, crafting weapons and armor to fend off the dangerous mobs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/minecraft-has-just-beaten-tetris-as-the-best-selling-video-game-of-all-time/">The video game phenomenon is bigger than ever before</a>, but this cross-play update is a huge stepping stone in general. With the introduction of Minecraft PS4 cross-play, Microsoft’s Xbox Live ecosystem is now in place on PlayStation 4.</p>
      <p>For parents, this news is amazing. Just think, for Christmas, it doesn’t matter what system you buy your kids, they can still play Minecraft with friends. What a world we live in.</p>
