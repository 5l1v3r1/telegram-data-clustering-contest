      </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, India's biggest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki had announced that it will increase prices of its various models from January 2020. The price increase will be different across models.</p>
      <p>"You are kindly informed that over the past year, the cost of the company's vehicles has been impacted adversely due to increase in various input costs. Hence, it has become imperative for the Company to pass on some impact of the above additional cost to customers through a price increase across various models in January 2020. This price increase shall vary for different models," the company said in a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>The decision to increase prices comes at a time when the Indian auto sector is battling its worst slowdown in decades. The price hike by auto companies from the beginning of next year is expected to encourage buyers to purchase a car before the end of this year.</p>
