      <h1>Dejan Lovren fit to travel with Liverpool squad to Salzburg</h1>

        <b>Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren is among Liverpool's travelling party for their UEFA Champions League game away to Salzburg. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Croatian was forced off in the first half of their 3-0 Premier League win away to Bournemouth on Saturday where he was replaced by Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
      <p>After Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/376930-dejan-lovren-injury-update">allayed fears</a> of a serious injury, Lovren has been named in the 19-man panel heading to Austria.</p>
      <p>Lovren's fitness comes as a boost, with Joel Matip still absent through injury.</p>
      <p>Georginio Wijnaldum has also been included, but Adam Lallana misses out.</p>
      <p>The former Southampton midfielder is continuing to recover from the knock that forced him to miss Saturday's win at the Vitality.</p>
      <p>Republic of Ireland U21 goalkeeper Caoimhín Kellher will serve as back-up to Alisson and Adrian.</p>
      <p>Liverpool need a draw against Salzburg to be sure of progress to the last-16, while victory will see the holders through as Group E winners.</p>

      <p>Salzburg's main threat will once again come from 19-year old striker Erling Braut Haaland.</p>
      <p>The son of former Nottingham Forest and Leeds United midfielder Alf-Inge Haaland became the first teenager in history to score in five consecutive Champions League games when he found the net against Genk a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Haaland already has 28 goals to his name in all competitions this season and has attracted the interest of a number of Europe's top clubs.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Tuesday night's game, Haaland cut a confident figure, "We have nothing to lose," said the Norwegian, "We will go out there and enjoy ourselves, smile, enjoy the game."</p>
      <p><b>Liverpool squad v Red Bull Salzburg:</b> Alisson, Virgil Van Dijk, Georginio Wijnaldum, Dejan Lovren, James Milner, Naby Keita, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané, Mo Salah, Joe Gomez, Adrian, Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Xherdan Shaqiri, Andy Robertson, Divock Origi, Curtis Jones, Caoimhín Kelleher, Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
