      <h1>'Middle-class' carriages: Rail passengers offered 'premium economy' fares</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:32:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/helena-horton/" target="_blank">Helena Horton</a></address>
      <p>Three classes of travel will be introduced to Britain's railways for the first time in 60 years, the chief executive of the new West Coast mainline has announced.</p>
      <p>While previously the only options on a train have been the plush seats and a hot meal in first class or a squeeze in standard, the new trains will feature a middle tier with snacks, more legroom and faster WiFi.</p>
      <p>Avanti West Coast, which replaced Virgin Trains on the West Coast Main Line on Sunday, is developing a premium economy-style offering, similar to that on airlines.</p>
      <p>Avanti managing director Phil Whittingham, who previously held the same role at Virgin Trains, said: "We know there is going to be three classes. It is going to be a first class, a premium economy-type style and economy."</p>
      <p>He said passengers in premium economy could be entitled to "the bigger seat, better wi-fi and snacks rather than a meal".</p>
      <p>Britain has not had three tiers of seats on its trains since 1956, when trains had first class, second class and third class.</p>
      <p>It is not known how much the new middle tier of fares would cost.</p>
      <p>Matthew Gregory, chief executive of FirstGroup, which joint-owns the franchise with Italian firm Trenitalia, said the change in policy is "about balancing and being flexible within the train".</p>
      <p>He went on: "Obviously first class can be quite expensive, so there are different price points between standard class and first class and it is about seeing if we can offer a more flexible offering that suits more price points."</p>
      <p>It is likely that the new tickets will come into play when the Pendolino trains inherited from Virgin are upgraded.</p>
      <p>First Rail managing director Steve Montgomery described the 56 trains the company inherited from Virgin Trains as “tired”.</p>
      <p>The firm has promised to significantly improve the carriages used with a £117 million refurbishment of the Pendolinos and replacing Super Voyagers with new trains.</p>
      <p>There will be 25,000 new seats, more reliable wi-fi and improved catering. The revamp of the trains is likely to happen by autumn 2020, and the new trains will be on the line by 2022.</p>
      <p>FirstGroup reportedly considered introducing three classes on west coast services in its ill-fated 2012 bid for the franchise.</p>
      <p>A year later, the Department for Transport was forced to deny it was planning to require a "third-class service" to be introduced on the East Coast Main Line, after a three-tier system was included in a leaked franchise prospectus ahead of a return to private ownership.</p>
      <p>Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61.com, told the PA news agency: "When it comes to intercity travel, there does seem to be scope for having some extra classes, but it depends what they're doing and how they're doing it."</p>
      <p>Cross-Channel rail operator Eurostar offers three classes of travel.</p>
      <p>The middle class, named Standard Premier, entitles ticket holders to a larger seat where they are served a light meal and drinks.</p>
