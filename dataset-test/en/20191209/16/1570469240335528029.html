      <p>Protesters demanding the immediate resignation of <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/maltas-ruling-party-lawmakers-back-embattled-prime-minister-265622">Malta's prime minister</a> blocked an entrance to his office on Monday, the latest demonstrations over his handling of a journalist's murder. </p>
      <p>The sit-in outside the side entrance of the offices of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat began shortly after 7:00 am and involved about 30 protesters. </p>
      <p>Activists sat on the ground, shouting and banging on drums and blowing whistles. It was not clear whether Muscat was in his offices at the time. </p>
      <p>At one point, journalists covering the sit-in were forced out of the passageway and protesters were locked inside by soldiers. They later exited the passageway, joining other protesters outside the building.</p>
      <p>Muscat announced earlier this month that he will resign in January, responding to a <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/rattled-by-journalist-murder-probe-maltas-ruling-party-meets-to-decide-pms-future-265579">wave of mass protests</a> over a much-criticised probe into the 2017 murder of journalist and blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia.</p>
      <p>The investigation, which is ongoing, has also led to the resignations of Muscat's chief of staff and tourism minister.</p>
      <p>Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017 after exposing corruption on the Mediterranean island that implicated top government officials. Her family has accused Muscat of protecting those involved in her murder.  </p>
