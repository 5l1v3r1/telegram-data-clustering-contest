      <p>A boat designed and built in east Cork is now fully fitted and ready for testing prior to attempting a new world record transatlantic crossing next summer.</p>
      <p>Following a rudimentary outing earlier this year, the now fully furbished Thunder Child II cut through the seas off Ireland’s south coast.</p>

      <p>Designed and built by Youghal-based Safehaven Marine, managing director Frank Kowalski describes the super-swift craft as “a unique, hybrid hull design, asymmetrical catamaran, with a wave-piercing deep V mono-hull”.</p>
      <p>Valued at over €1m, it is designed for high speed, with minimal turbulence.</p>
      <p>Measuring 23 m in length, it has a 5.3 m beam and boasts a Hyuscraft hydrofoil system fitted between the two catamaran hulls.</p>

      <p>“This massively reduces drag by lifting the boat about 400 ml out of the water”, Mr Kowalski explains.</p>
      <p>Thunder Child II has a fuel capacity of 7,500 litres, is powered by four Caterpillar 650hp engines with surface drive propulsion. It hits a top speed of 54 kts and has a 700+ knm range.</p>
      <p>In July 2017 the 17-metre original Thunder Child set a record in circumnavigating Ireland, anticlockwise, via Rockall, in just over 34 hours.</p>
      <p>Between July and August 2020 the same five-member crew, aboard Thunder Child II will attempt an unprecedented 4,500 km transatlantic route from Newfoundland to Killybegs, via refuelling stops at Greenland and Iceland.</p>
      <p>They hope to complete the trip in less than five days.</p>
      <p>The challenge holds considerable danger on seas “encompassing two of the most active and potentially violent weather systems in the world”, says Mr Kowalski.</p>
      <p>The timing aims to minimise the risk of Arctic sea ice and icebergs but nonetheless the boat will be “outside the shipping lanes in a region where survival in a life raft, even in the summer, would not be long”, adds the managing director.</p>
      <p>Safehaven Marine’s regular remit is to build high-speed commercial and naval/military craft. It has supplied more than 120 boats to some 26 countries worldwide since being established in 1998. It employs 30 people.</p>
      <p>Thunder Child II will now undertake extensive sea trials in preparation for next year’s venture, including a long-distance trial run.</p>
