      <p>The Zonal Head, Mailafiya Yakubu, disclosed this after a walk from the EFCC Office as part of activity to mark the 2019 International Anti-corruption Day.</p>
      <p>Mr Yakubu also said the office currently has about 100 cases ongoing in courts, adding that more would be convicted before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>He said close to N300 million had been recovered and returned to people that have been defrauded within the period.</p>
      <p>“Not only that, we have gotten interim forfeiture of 15 houses acquired through illicit means and currently working towards getting final forfeiture.</p>

      <p>“That we have been able to receive over 580 petitions in 11 months is an indication of public confidence in EFCC.</p>
      <p>“So far so good. We have gotten reasonable conviction and still counting and we will continue to arrest and prosecute, even on Christmas day,” he said.</p>
      <p>He explained that the objective of the walk was to enlighten the public on the ills of corruption and its negative effect on the society.</p>
      <p>“We want the people to know that corruption is evil, dangerous and disastrous and the public must join the fight against all forms of corruption.</p>
      <p>“I am happy that we have gotten the public on our side. This is a good achievement in the fight against corruption in the country,” Mr Yakubu added.</p>
