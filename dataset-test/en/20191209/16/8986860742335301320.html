      <h1>Rev. Obofour hints to name TMA officials who took bribe from him</h1>

      <p>The leader and founder of Anointed Palace Chapel Rev. Obofour has hinted that he will in the coming days list the name of some corrupt officials of the Tema Municipal Assembly (TMA) who took bribes from him.</p>
      <p>It would be recalled that some days ago, it was reported that some persons from the assembly where beaten by Rev. Obofour’s men which included his junior pastor when the people came to inspect their church building.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the fracas that ensued on the premises of his church in Tema, Rev. Obofour called the TMA official “liars” and rather accused them of attacking three of his security men on the church premises without any justification.</p>
      <p><i>“I will talk when you push me. Anyone who has collected money in connection with the construction of the building will have to vomit it when we get to the court,” </i>he threatened</p>
      <p>He continued that the allegations levelled against his church workers by the assembly were fabricated to cover their bad deeds at his church.</p>
      <p><i>“I want the government to know that we did not take the law into our hands but they rather assaulted three security men at the church,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p><i>“I am stating on authority that no well-built men assaulted anyone at my church. The person who said well-built men assaulted someone at my church is a liar, and those who do not understand can send me anywhere they want,” </i>he declared.</p>
