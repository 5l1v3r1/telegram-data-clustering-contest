      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Reports in China that a library staff burned dozens of "illegal" books is drawing controversy in the country, but the articles and social media posts on the matter have been removed.</p>
      <p>The "national first-class" library in Zhenyuan county, Gansu province in northwest China, was the site of a book burning, according to photos and a story from China's Red Star news on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"There's nothing to say about this, and no reason to discuss it," said a library source in the report. The South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3041230/chinese-library-sparks-outrage-over-report-staff-burned-banned">reported Monday</a> the story had been taken down, in addition to commentary from state-run Beijing Times.</p>
      <p>The Beijing Times had described the book burning as a "savage" act.</p>
      <p>"How books and other publications are treated, at any point in time, is a test of society's attitude to knowledge and civilization, and it cannot be random and savage," the Chinese article read, before it was taken down, according to the Post.</p>
      <p>A state-sanctioned report published in October to a government site included a photo of two library staff members burning books outside the entrance of the library. According to the story, the library destroyed 65 books. The staff called the move a "thorough cleanup" and described the destroyed books as "illegal publications and religious publications, especially books, pictorial publications and visual content that showed leanings."</p>
      <p>Hong Kong-based Mingpao Daily reported the burning of the books was "unprecedented." In the past, Chinese authorities shredded books, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The paper also said online commenters in China compared the incident to the burning of books by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of unified China in 212 BCE.</p>
      <p>The burning of books in antiquity was supposedly accompanied by the live burial of 460 Confucian scholars; modern historians dispute the claims, however.</p>
      <p>"Who will they bury after they burned the books?" said one commenter on Chinese social media platform Weibo.</p>
