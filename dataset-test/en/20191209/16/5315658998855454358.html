      <p>9 December 2019</p>
      <p>In partnership with the JR McKenzie Trust and University of Otago, Children’s Commissioner Andrew Becroft has today released the annual Child Poverty Monitor at <a href="https://www.childpoverty.org.nz/">childpoverty.org.nz</a> which shows more bold and sustainable action is needed.</p>
      <p>“Every child in Aotearoa New Zealand deserves to have the opportunity and support they need to live a good life.</p>
      <p>“But some families can’t keep up with the ever-increasing costs of daily living, like rent and putting food on the table.</p>
      <p>“148,000 children are living in households doing it really tough. That’s a city bigger than Dunedin, full of children whose families can’t afford the basics like having enough to eat, sturdy shoes and warm clothes.</p>
      <p>“We have 254,000 children living households with less than half the median income after paying for their housing*. To reach its child poverty reduction target of reducing this number by 130,000, the Government will need to make big, bold changes.</p>
      <p>“I want to see family incomes dramatically raised by increasing benefits and making the minimum wage a living wage.</p>
      <p>“And the Government needs to move much faster at increasing the supply of social housing – building, buying and repurposing - and working closely with community-based housing providers.</p>
      <p>“We have the potential and the current resources to be a country where all children and young people thrive. We can do it. For those children I see, who are living in the most challenging circumstances, change can’t come fast enough.</p>
      <p>“I am pleased that we’ve started the journey with Child Poverty Reduction legislation, the Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy, and linking benefits to wages.</p>
      <p>“Government has made increases in Working for Families, Best Start for Children, and winter energy payments. I can’t underestimate what a fantastic start this is.</p>
      <p>“But we need to see significant and permanent changes to unlock opportunities for those doing it hardest. One-offs aren’t going to cut it anymore,” says Commissioner Becroft.</p>

        <i>The Child Poverty Monitor reports on child poverty in New Zealand and its impacts. The Child Poverty Monitor is a partnership project between the Office of the Children’s Commissioner, the JR McKenzie Trust and the New Zealand Child and Youth Epidemiology Service at the University of Otago.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>In 2012, the Children’s Commissioner’s Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty put forward 78 recommendations on a range of ways to address child poverty.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>One of those recommendations identified, was the need to measure and report on child poverty rates annually. We believe this is a vital step in reducing child poverty in New Zealand and that is why this</i>

        <i>project was born.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The look, feel and focus of the Child Poverty Monitor has changed. We want to reflect a more aspirational approach to reducing child poverty, including the direction in the Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The measures of child poverty and its impacts use a variety of official data sources in Aotearoa.</i>
