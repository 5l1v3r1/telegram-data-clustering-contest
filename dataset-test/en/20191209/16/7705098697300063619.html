      <h1>Heroes Deal with an Important Loss in Crisis on Infinite Earths Episode 2 Promo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:41:38+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p><b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> </b>has kicked things off and has already caused an important loss for the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/arrowverse"><b>Arrowverse</b></a> team of superheroes. In the next episode, the team will have to fight the Anti-Monitor without Green Arrow, who has presumably died. There is no time for tears, though, as the end of the multiverse is still pending.</p>
      <p>The synopsis of the next episode reads as follows:</p>
      <p>“The group uses Ray’s (guest star Brandon Routh) invention to track new recruits to help save the universe. The Monitor (guest star LaMonica Garrett) sends Iris (guest star Candice Patton), Clark (guest star Tyler Hoechlin) and Lois (guest star Elizabeth Tulloch) in search of a mysterious Kryptonian, while Kate (Ruby Rose) and Kara (guest star Melissa Benoist) head out to find Bruce Wayne (guest star Kevin Conroy). In addition, Mia (guest star Katherine McNamara) challenges Sara (guest star Caity Lotz), Rory (guest star Dominic Purcell) discovers a hidden talent, and Lex Luthor (guest star Jon Cryer) returns.”</p>
      <p>Laura Belsey directed the episode written by Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson. You can watch the new <b>Crisis on Infinite Earths </b>Episode 2 promo in the player below.</p>
