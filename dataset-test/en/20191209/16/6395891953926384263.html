      <p><b>DEDHAM, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - The murder trial of a Massachusetts woman charged with killing her 81-year-old neighbor ended Monday when the judge called a mistrial because the defense attorney was struck by a car.</p>
      <p>Norfolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connors declared a mistrial in the trial of Tammie Galloway, who's charged with killing Laura Shifrina in May 2017 at a Needham Housing Authority apartment complex.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Elliot Levine was struck by an car over the weekend, sustaining serious but non-life threatening injuries, the Norfolk district attorney said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>A retrial was scheduled for May 12.</p>
      <p>Galloway killed Shifrina and stole money and her car, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Galloway's attorney told the jury that his client, who was involved in drugs, stole the money and car, but said she did not kill the victim.</p>
      <p>Shifrina was a Jewish refugee who immigrated from to the United States in 2000, her daughter said. She worked as a computer software engineer in Moscow and was a member of the Massachusetts Club of Russian Speaking Scientists, her daughter said.</p>
