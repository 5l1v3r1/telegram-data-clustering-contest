      <p>It was a pleasure to spend time with David Sparks and Stephen Hackett talking about Catalyst apps on the Mac for <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/513">episode 513 of Mac Power Users</a>. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/catalyst/">and covering Catalyst</a> for the past 18 months since Apple gave developers a sneak peek at it during WWDC in 2018, so it was a lot of fun to join Sparks and Hackett to take stock of where Catalyst stands today and where it’s heading. Of course, we also covered a long list of our favorite Catalyst apps.</p>
