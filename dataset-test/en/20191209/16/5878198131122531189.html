      <h1>Beverley Walrond: Barbados loses one of its influential attorneys in family and child law</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:30:52+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Theodora Aidoo</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/heres-a-manual-for-any-seafood-enthusiast-visiting-bridgetown-barbados">Barbados</a> is one of the populous and prosperous Caribbean islands with political, economic and social stability, as well as, influential people who are impacting lives tremendously.</p>
      <p>One of such people is Lady Beverley Walrond, QC. She was a qualified Mediator and has quite a number of experiences outside of legal practice as well. She acted as a Judge of the High Court of Barbados in two cases. She was known for her general law practice with specialization in family and child law.</p>
      <p>She was called to the Bar in Barbados in April 1974 and later joined the Attorney-General’s Chambers as Crown Counsel, (Ag). Subsequently, she took the position of Senior Crown Counsel. </p>
      <p>Many years later she went into private practice in Barbados, partnering with Smith &amp; Smith <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/5-great-black-lawyers-whose-pioneering-works-changed-america-over-time">law</a> firm. As time passed, she established her own firm and was appointed as one of Her Majesty’s Counsel. </p>
      <p>Lady Walrond became a member of the <a href="http://eugenedupuchlaw.edu.bs/celebrating-40-years-of-the-council-of-legal-education-2/">Council of Legal Education</a> in 1994 and was arguably one of the most influential lawyers in the Caribbean. Her law firm focused on family and child law.</p>
      <p>Using the justice system as a legal advisor for Child Care Board, Walrond worked to see <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/child-abuse-remains-endemic-africa">child abuse</a> cases addressed with speed and efficiency.</p>
      <p>“I use this opportunity to bring to the table, and once again issue a call for all cases concerning a child complainant in sexual abuse matters, particularly, to be heard within a reasonable time.</p>
      <p>“When these cases are delayed, often for years, those children are re-victimized by not being able to put the matter behind them, and by having to rehash the facts many years later,” she once <a href="https://www.barbadosadvocate.com/news/ccb%E2%80%99s-walrond-expediting-child-abuse-matters">said</a>.</p>

      <p>She would remain firm on the stance of confidentiality for children who have been abused and also urged media practitioners to be circumspect in their publication of child abuse cases.</p>
      <p>Sadly, the prominent Barbadian attorney-at-law passed away in Miami, Florida following injuries from a car crash. She was involved in a motor crash with her husband Sir Errol Walrond, but passed on Dec 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>“We regret to announce the passing of Lady Beverley Walrond. Lady Walrond died as a result of severe injuries in a motor vehicle accident on Thursday December 5, 2019.The family would like to thank all those who reached out to us at this tragic time. Although we could not respond to everyone your support was much appreciated. Funeral arrangements will be announced at a later date,” a statement issued by the family <a href="http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/lady-beverly-walrond-passes-after-car-accident">read</a>.</p>
