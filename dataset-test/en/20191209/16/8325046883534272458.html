      <p>It may be hard to believe, but even superstar Beyoncé isn’t always secure in her appearance.</p>
      <p>In a new <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29999871/beyonce-ivy-park-adidas-interview/">interview in Elle magazine</a>, Knowles-Carter discussed her body evolution and how motherhood and getting older has helped her come to terms with her changing body.</p>
      <p>After going through a <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-is-preeclampsia-toxemia-2018-8">difficult pregnancy with her twins</a> Rumi and Sir, Knowles-Carter said she used 2019 as a year to focus on self-care and her own health. To do this, she said she focuses on a healthy diet and does <a href="https://www.insider.com/patrick-dempsey-loves-acupuncture-offers-it-at-cancer-center-2019-11">acupuncture</a>, meditation, and <a href="https://www.insider.com/camila-cabello-deep-breathing-stress-anxiety-relief-2019-8">breathing exercises</a>.</p>
      <p>It paid off.</p>
      <p>“If someone told me 15 years ago that my body would go through so many changes and fluctuations, and that I would feel more womanly and secure with my curves, I would not have believed them,” the “Formation” singer said.</p>
      <p>Knowles-Carter also said she recently learned how to find self-worth beyond her physical appearance and discussed how rewarding that experience has been.</p>
      <p>She said she now knows she’s “more than enough no matter what stage I’m at in life. Giving zero f—-s is the most liberating place to be.”</p>

      <h3>This isn’t the first time Beyoncé has opened up about her difficult pregnancy</h3>
      <p>The Netflix documentary “Homecoming” that details Knowles-Carter’s 2018 Coachella performance also offered a look into the the complications the songstress faced because she had toxemia (also known as <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-is-preeclampsia-toxemia-2018-8">preeclampsia</a>), a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure, <a href="https://www.insider.com/beyonce-diets-22-day-master-cleanse-vegan-coachella-2019-8">weight gain</a>, and protein in the urine.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-september-issue-2018">Beyoncé also detailed her complicated pregnancy</a> in a personal essay in the September 2018 issue of Vogue.</p>
      <p>In the essay, the mom of three wrote she was “swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month” during the time. Ultimately, the condition caused her to have an <a href="https://www.insider.com/celebrities-who-had-difficult-pregnancies-2019-9">emergency C-section</a> to deliver the twins. Following the birth, she and the twins spent weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit.</p>
      <p>“I was in survival mode and did not grasp it all until months later,” Beyoncé wrote.</p>
