      <p>It was last week when a leak occurred on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/05/vanquish-and-bayonetta-remasters-listed-on-the-microsoft-store/">Microsoft Store</a> that basically confirmed a re-release of SEGA’s fast-paced shooter Vanquish, and witch based action game Bayonetta. Today, SEGA has revealed the Bayonetta and Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle which will be released on February 18th for PS4 and Xbox One.</p>

      <p>These are remasters with the games running at 4K and 60fps on the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. Pre-orders are available now with physical and digital versions of the bundle. Those who get it digitally will get access to two themes, detailed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bayonetta &amp; Vanquish Theme – available instantly for all digital pre-orders, will not be available at or after launch.</li>
        <li>Bayonetta &amp; Vanquish 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Theme – available for a limited time for all pre-orders and purchases up to March 3, 2020 – two weeks after launch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Those who buy physical will get a special edition steel book case. If you haven’t played either or want a throwback you can find some excerpts from our reviews for the games below. First up, Bayonetta.</p>
      <blockquote>“The truth is, sadly, that there are better same-genre games around just now.  Dante’s Inferno and God Of War III on the surface (and judging by our playtests) appear to be smoother, slicker experiences with the latter a trusted staple for PS3 gamers who really shouldn’t be pushed towards Sega’s latest multiformat title.  Sure, there’s a decent game here if you can’t wait for the big hitters just around the corner, but if patience isn’t a virtue of yours then perhaps Bayonetta isn’t the one for you anyway, at least unless you’re going for the 360 version.  Shame, as Bayonetta has solid principles and a sequel could very well be amazing.”</blockquote>
      <p>The full Bayonetta review can be read <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/01/08/review-bayonetta/">here</a>. What about Vanquish? How did that fare in its review? Here’s a look from its PC release a couple of years back.</p>
      <blockquote>Vanquish does have its problems, but very few of them are tied to the PC port, which incidentally makes this version the best one by default. It’s B-movie nonsense at its best, with a science fiction setting, and very cool action sequences. It could definitely do with a bit more variety in enemies at times and it’s a little on the short side, but it’s still a great romp seven years later.</blockquote>
