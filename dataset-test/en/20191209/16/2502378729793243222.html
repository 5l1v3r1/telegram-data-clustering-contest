      <p>The Annie Leibowitz-helmed photos show Cardi B and her daughter, Kulture, at home, as the cover story focuses on the rapper balancing motherhood with the stresses of fame, as well as her imminent next album. ""Being a mom—how can I say it? Things are a little bit harder to balance, but it's good for the mental," Cardi B tells <i>Vogue</i>. "Like, if I'm playing with my daughter, I forget about the issues."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the story, she talks about her long-awaited second studio album, which will be released early next year: "It's scary because it's like, now you got to top your first album, and then it's like, damn. I wonder if people are gonna relate to the new things, to the new life, to the new shit that I gotta talk about now," Cardi B says of the music selection. "Music is changing. I feel like people just wanna hear twerk-twerk music, but it's like, is that just a phase? I probably need a sexy song. I need a lot of turn-up songs. I need a slow song, a personal song. And those are harder for me—I always need help when it comes to talking about my feelings.</p>
      <p>The rapper also reaffirms her support for Bernie Sanders, stating that he "has the perfect intentions," and that when it comes to her ideal president, she wants a candidate who is not an entertainer. " I want my president to be, like, extremely holy," she says. "That is the person I want to look up to. I don't want my president to have any hatred toward a certain type of people. I don't want my president to be arguing with freaking celebrities or caring what people think of him. I want my president to tell me an answer on shit that really matters. I don't want my president to entertain me. I just don't."</p>
