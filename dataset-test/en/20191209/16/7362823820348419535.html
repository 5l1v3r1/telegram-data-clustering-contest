      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota">Minnesota</a> man's obituary claims he died last week after the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/minnesota-vikings">Vikings</a> succumbed to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl">Monday Night Football</a> defeat against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
      <p>John J. Ford, of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">Plymouth</a>, "passed away surrounded by family on December 2nd after the Vikings allowed 17 unanswered points," his <a href="http://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/0000336955/?fullname=john-j-ford">obituary</a>, published in the Star Tribune on Thursday, joked.</p>

      <p>The Minnesota Vikings led 17-10 at half-time, but that lead was wiped out in the third quarter when Seahawks tailback Rashaad Penny tied the game with a 1-yard run, before a Jason Myers field goal put the Seahawks 20-17 up.</p>
      <p>Russell Wilson then connected with David Moore for a 60-yard pass with five seconds left in the quarter to give them a 27-17 lead. Rubbing salt into the wound, the Hawks then went 34-17 up early in the fourth quarter, before the Vikings crept back into it.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the Vikings <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/seahawks-top-vikings-37-30">lost 37-30</a>, although they rebounded this past weekend with a 20-7 victory over the Detroit Lions. Their record currently stands at 9-4, one game behind the Seahawks at 10-3. Both teams currently occupy NFC wildcard slots.</p>

      <p>The 86-year-old football fan, who was born and raised in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">Buffalo, N.Y.</a>, loved the Minnesota Vikings, in addition to Notre Dame, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf">golf</a> and a "good cigar."</p>
      <p>Ford's obituary states he served as a 1st Lieutenant in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army">U.S. Army</a> as a paratrooper with the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry. He worked in various business executive positions before opening up his own company, JFR Marketing, in the mid-1980s, his family said.</p>
