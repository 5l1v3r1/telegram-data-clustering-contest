      <p>Gino D'Acampo had <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> viewers in hysterics when he struggled to pronounce a word and accidentally dropped a series of X-rated expletives.</p>
      <p>The Italian chef, 43, was hosting a cookery segment with presenters <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> when he made the blunder.</p>

      </p>
      <p>They were talking about truffles when Gino explained that not many people like them due to their smell, which Holly said she doesn't mind.</p>
      <p>He insisted that if you open a jar of truffles and give it one big sniff, you might change your mind as the aromas hit your nostrils.</p>
      <p>Gino explained on the programme, as he prepared to open a jar for Holly to have a whiff: "For people at home, [if] you don't like it, do this experiment.</p>

      <p>"I'm going to open and what I want you to do is to just analate it. Analate it as much as you can.</p>
      <p>"The more you do that, the more you analate and the more you...â€™</p>
      <p>But Phil and Holly interrupted to correct him: "Inhale!"</p>
      <p>Gino, confused, asked: "What did I say?"</p>
      <p>"'Analate', I think," Holly replied, struggling to keep a straight face.</p>
      <p>Gino continued, "I meant, 'anal eat'" and Phil begged him, "Stop. Stop!"</p>

      <p>Viewers at home reacted to the moment on Twitter.</p>
      <p>One said: "I have #ThisMorning on in the background. Did Gino say 'anal it' instead of 'inhale'?"</p>
      <aside>You mean 'inhale it' Gino!</aside>
      <p>Another tweeted: "The more you 'anal it'. Poor Gino #ThisMorning."</p>
      <p>A third said: "'The more you analate' Um... Gino #ThisMorning."</p>
      <p>"The more you anal it!" someone else wrote, adding with crying-laughing emojis: "You mean 'inhale it' Gino! #ThisMorning."</p>

      </p>
      <p>During the cookery segment, Gino appeared without <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/this-morning-fans-in-stitches-as-phil-schofield-mocks-gino-dacampos-new-look/">his recently adopted rock 'n' roll style</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the last few months, the Celebrity Juice star had featured on the programme wearing a bandanna around his head.</p>
      <p>But viewers who hated it flocked to social media after each appearance to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/fans-beg-gino-dacampo-to-ditch-the-bandana/">beg him to ditch the look</a>, which many put down to a midlife crisis.</p>
