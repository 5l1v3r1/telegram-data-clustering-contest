      <p>A keen cyclist has brought some festive cheer to the streets of <b><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/london/">north London</a></b> by using his fitness app to map out a reindeer.</p>

      <p>In previous years, the 51-year-old has etched out a Santa Claus figure, a snowman and a Yorkshire terrier around Leeds.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his latest feat, he said: "I’m pretty happy with it.</p>
      <p>"Until you get back and upload it, you’re not quite sure whether it’s going to work or not.</p>
      <p>"I live in the countryside and it’s very different to coming into London," he said.</p>
      <p>"Particularly around Neasden and Wembley, it’s not the most pleasant cycling.</p>
      <p>"That’s about my maximum distance – I wouldn’t want to go too much above that.</p>
      <p>"It’s a long day in the saddle."</p>

      <p>He continued: "I just spend a lot of time looking at maps and it’s waiting for things to jump out at you.</p>
      <p>"Normally I look at maps until I see something – ‘That looks a bit like a nose’ – so I think ‘Where can I find eyes near that?’</p>
      <p>"It’s like looking at patterns in clouds and seeing pictures.</p>
      <p>"With these ones it’s a bit more tricky because I’m trying to do something festive so it’s harder, but it’s the same process really."</p>

      <p>He added: “In a sense I’ve made a rod for my own back in that it’s become a tradition and everyone was saying: ‘So what’s it going to be this year?'”</p>
      <p>But in the end, the reindeer turned out almost exactly as planned.</p>
      <p>"There’s a little glitch in there near Shepherd’s Bush where I obviously lost the GPS signal and it creates a straight line that cuts through a couple of street blocks, but that’s minor," he said.</p>
      <p>"I made a couple of mistakes but they’re so small that nobody’s going to notice really.</p>
      <p>"I’m happy. It looks how I wanted it to look."</p>
