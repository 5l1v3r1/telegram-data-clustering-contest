      <p>The mafia have relaxed their rules on homosexuality, a top Italian prosecutor has revealed.</p>
      <p>Previously even rumours of being gay were punishable by death, but now the son of a mob chief is living as a drag queen called Lady Godiva.</p>
      <p>Anti-mafia investigator Nicola Gratteri said: "It undermines their image of themselves as tough, virile guys. But the mafia have evolved along with society.</p>
      <p>"Gays can be accepted now, even as foot soldiers, so long as they don’t parade it in public."</p>
      <p>Mr Gratteri, 61, told The Sunday Times he has seen ‘passionate’ letters between a crime boss and a young lieutenant.</p>
