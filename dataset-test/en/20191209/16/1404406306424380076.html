      <p><a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259282/judge-upholds-charges-that-could-land-harvey-weinstein-in-prison-for-life">Harvey Weinstein may be in more trouble</a>, as prosecutors are now saying he violated the conditions of his release. As a result, prosecutors are asking for his bond to be set to $5 million.</p>
      <p>Assistant DA Joan Orbon spoke to a judge in a Manhattan Supreme Court saying “The bottom line, judge, is this man could fly out on a private jet which he does and go to another country.” Weinstein’s lawyer said there aren’t enough cell towers near his home to keep his signaling device and bracelet connected so he can be tracked.</p>
      <p>Weinstein is set to be on trial January 6, 2020 and is facing up to life in prison for five counts of predatory sexual assault, rape, and criminal sex acts.</p>
