      <p>Officers are struggling to identify the woman who fell in Lima Road on Sunday.</p>
      <p>She was discovered at around 11pm with ‘serious head injuries’ on the street.</p>
      <p>The woman was taken to Royal Preston Hospital by ambulance and her condition is currently described as poorly.</p>
      <p>DS Lee Kelly, of West Division Police, said: “We would like to reiterate that, at this time, there is nothing to suggest there are any suspicious circumstances surrounding this lady’s injuries.</p>
      <p>“However we are struggling to establish who she is.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps you recognise the description and think she may be someone who lives near you, or who you often see in your local area.</p>
      <p>“Maybe you were in the Lima Road area last night and think you may have seen her, and are able to tell us which direction she came from.</p>
      <p>“If you think you can help us please get in touch with us as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>The woman is described as white, aged between 70 and 80, approximately 5ft 4ins tall, of slim build, with shoulder length grey/silver hair.</p>
      <p>When she was found she was wearing a navy-coloured coat, dark blue denim jeans, a white patterned blouse and a pair of boat shoes.</p>
      <p>Police maintained a presence at the scene yesterday with a police car remaining where the woman fell with police tape around the pavement.</p>
      <p>Anybody with information is asked to get in touch with police by calling either 101 or (01253) 604153, or email 3364@lancashire.pnn.police.uk, quoting log number 1474 of December 8.</p>
