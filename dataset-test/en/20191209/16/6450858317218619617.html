      <p>Below we'll offer links to watch some of our favourite Christmas movies of all time, but if you want festive films on tap and all for free sign up for a trial to a streaming service such as NowTV or Amazon (sadly Netflix has now ditched its free trial in the UK). Cinema Paradiso is a great alternative if you prefer to watch your movies on DVD.</p>

                        <p>When Bad Santa came out in 2003 it quickly became something of a cult classic. As an antidote to the feel-good nature of most Christmas movies it is hard to fault. Bad Santa casts Billy Bob Thornton as the world's department store santa, being mean to kids in order to rob his employers. It's scabrous, quotable and funny, and a must-see for many each festive season.</p>

Home Alone 2 and Home Alone 3 were also awesome, but it all went a bit wrong when Culkin became too old for the role and it was given to another actor in Home Alone 4.</p>
                            <p>Home Alone tells the story of a young boy who is accidentally left home alone while his family is on a Christmas holiday and goes about setting up a series of traps for two burglars intent on raiding his home. The result is an awful lot of laughs, and a warm, fuzzy feeling when young Kevin is finally reunited with his mum.</p>

Jingle All The Way sees Arnold Schwarzenegger and a rival dad played by Sinbad desperate to get their hands on a Turbo-Man action figure in time for Christmas, and hilarity ensues.</p>

                                      <p>Just about everything you could imagine that could possibly go wrong goes wrong for the Griswolds one Christmas in this 1989 film. To top it all off, dad Clark learns he hasn't been paid the Christmas bonus he was depending on and finally loses the plot. It's okay, though, because not only does Clark end up with his bonus but a 20 percent payrise. If only that could happen in real life.</p>

                                        <p>We all know the song, and this is the movie that made it famous. Bing Crosby co-stars in this 1954 Christmas musical romcom with Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen. Beginning Christmas Eve 1944, two US Army soldiers, a broadway entertainer and another aspiring entertainer perform for the 151st Division. They go on to make it big, and decide to help out a friend in need as they learn that their old commanding officer General Wavely is running a failing inn.</p>

                                          <p>Steven Spielberg's E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is played every Christmas and has been for as long as we can remember - well, ever since its release in 1982 in any case. It stars a very young Drew Barrymore (Gertie) alongside Henry Thomas (Elliott) and Robert MacNaughton (Michael) who befriend an alien creature who has been left stranded on Earth. Between the three of them they manage to feed it, look after it and mostly keep it hidden as they figure out a way to eventually return it home, which is heartbreaking for all involved.</p>
