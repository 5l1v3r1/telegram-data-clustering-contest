      <h1>ESPN Is Predicting The SEC Will Dominate Bowl Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:18:34+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28226028/picks-predictions-every-college-football-bowl-game-including-national-championship">has rolled out its predictions</a> for every college football bowl game. It looks like it’s going to be another good year for the SEC.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s predictions, the SEC will finish 9-1 in bowl games this year, highlighted by LSU’s wins over Oklahoma and Clemson in the College Football Playoff, on way to the national championship.</p>
      <blockquote>The Tigers give an improving LSU defense all it can handle, but Joe Burrow rallies the Tigers to complete a dream season where everything lined up perfectly. Burrow throws two fourth-quarter touchdown passes, including the game-winner to Justin Jefferson in the final minute.</blockquote>
      <p>ESPN’s predictions for the SEC:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Texas Bowl:</b> Oklahoma State 33, Texas A&amp;M 27<br/><b>Music City Bowl:</b> Mississippi State 34, Louisville 27<br/><b>Orange Bowl:</b> Florida 37, Virginia 16<br/><b>Belk Bowl:</b> Kentucky 29, Virginia Tech 24<br/><b>Citrus Bowl:</b> Alabama 44, Michigan 31<br/><b>Outback Bowl:</b> Auburn 31, Minnesota 20<br/><b>Sugar Bowl:</b> Georgia 26, Baylor 17<br/><b>Gator Bowl:</b> Tennessee 37, Indiana 34<br/><b>Peach Bowl (CFP semifinal):</b> LSU 42, Oklahoma 27<br/><b>National Championship:</b> LSU 38, Clemson 37</blockquote>
      <p>ESPN’s only projected loss for the SEC is Texas A&amp;M losing to Oklahoma State in the Texas Bowl to kick things off.</p>
      <p>The Big Ten has an opportunity to make some major noise too, though. Michigan, Minnesota and Indiana all have a chance to take down notable SEC teams. And then there’s Ohio State, which could knock off Clemson and LSU on way to a national championship.</p>
      <p>Right now, though, ESPN is predicting a huge postseason for the SEC.</p>
