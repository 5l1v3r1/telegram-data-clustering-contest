      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday has declared Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz’s petition seeking removal of her name from Exit Control List (ECL) as inadmissible and directed her to approach the interior ministry in this regard.</p>
      <p>A two-member bench headed by Justice Ali Baqir Najafi conducted hearing on the plea filed by PML-N leader through lawyers Amjad Pervez and Azam Nazeer.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, Maryam Nawaz’s counsel said that the name of his client was placed on no-fly list without hearing her stance. We don’t have any other forum better than the court that’s why we have raised this matter here, he told.</p>
      <p>The judge asked about filing of review petition over which, the lawyer said that the federal ministers are adamant over not letting Maryam Nawaz to go abroad. The government would never give decision in Maryam’s favor as it doesn’t want her to travel outside the country, he went on to say.</p>
      <p>Justice Ali Baqir remarked, “You should first contact the interior ministry and wait for its decision, then approach the judiciary.”</p>
      <p>Subsequently, the court has disposed of the petition and directed the federal government to decide on the matter within seven days.</p>
      <p>Earlier in November, <a href="https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/517071-Chuadhry-Sugar-Mills-case:-LHC-to-announce-reserved-verdict-on-Maryam-Na"><b><i>Maryam Nawaz had been granted bail</i></b></a> by LHC in Chaudhry Sugar Mills case against two surety bonds worth 10 million and submission of her passport.</p>
      <p>On August 8, NAB team had detained Maryam Nawaz outside the Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore for skipping appearance in Chaudhry Sugar Mills due to meeting with her father Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>Maryam Nawaz was unable to provide the required details of foreign investment in sugar mills while she was also failed to satisfy the bureau regarding source of income for purchasing the shares. NAB had also claimed that three foreigners had transferred 11000 shares worth millions of rupees on Maryam Nawaz’s name.</p>
      <p>On July 19, accountability court had turned down petition of NAB claiming Maryam Nawaz had produced a bogus trust deed in Avenfield reference.</p>
      <p>Judge Mohammad Bashir had declared anti-corruption watchdog’s appeal as unmaintainable and ruled that no action can be taken in this regard until the decision of Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Maryam’s petition against the Avenfield properties verdict.</p>
      <p>On July 6, 2018, accountability judge Mohammad Bashir had convicted former premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in Avenfield properties reference and sentenced them 10 years and 07 years imprisonment, respectively.</p>
      <p>In the verdict, judge Bashir had declared that “The trust deeds produced by the accused Maryam Nawaz were also found bogus… In view of the role of this accused Maryam Nawaz, she is convicted and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for seven years with fine of two million pounds.”</p>
      <p>She was arrested and shifted to Adiala jail. Later, in September 2018, and was released from jail after the Islamabad High Court suspended her prison sentence.</p>
