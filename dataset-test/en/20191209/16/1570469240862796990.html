      <p>Russia's anti-doping agency chief on Monday said that his country has ''no chance'' of winning an appeal against a four-year international sporting ban.</p>
      <p>"There is no chance of winning this case in court," RUSADA chief Yury Ganus told AFP after the World Anti-Doping Agency imposed the ban that will rule Russia out of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>The ban decision was taken by WADA's executive committee after the <a href="https://www.wionews.com/sports/wada-seeks-russia-ban-over-doping-data-manipulation-264626">Compliance Review Committee</a> (CRC) called for the proposed sanctions in a 26-page report. </p>
      <p>RUSADA's supervisory board is set to meet on December 19 to take a decision on whether to appeal the ban, he said.</p>
      <p>"This is a tragedy," he said. "Clean athletes are seeing their rights limited."</p>
      <p>Ganus said that some Russian athletes were contemplating leaving Russia so that they could train elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He described the sentiments among athletes as "awful," stressing that four years for a sportsman is a long time in what can be a short career.</p>
      <p>Earlier Monday WADA's executive committee, meeting in Lausanne, decided that Russia be handed a four-year suspension after accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory data.</p>
      <p>"The full list of recommendations have been unanimously accepted," said <a href="https://www.wionews.com/sports/wada-imposes-four-year-ban-on-russia-over-doping-data-manipulation-267195">WADA spokesperson</a> James Fitzgerald. </p>
      <p>"WADA's executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years," he added.</p>
      <p>Russian athletes have already faced a series of bans over the last few years and were forced to participate in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games as neutral competitors.</p>
      <p>The heads of several Russian sports federations said they were preparing to send athletes to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p>Russia's swimming federation's head, Vladimir Salnikov, said the country's athletes "must go to the Olympics whatever the situation."</p>
      <p>"Of course we'd prefer that our athletes participate under the Russian flag and hear their national anthem. But the circumstances may be different... (and) no-one has the right to deprive innocent athletes of their dreams," he told state news agency RIA Novosti.</p>
      <p>"If (participating under a neutral flag) is the only possibility, we must go and win. Our clean athletes, I am sure, will show that they are strong, even in these circumstances," said the head of the waterpolo, diving and synchronised swimming federation, Alexei Vlasenko.</p>
      <p>CRC had earlier declared the Russian Anti Doping Agency (RUSADA) to be <a href="https://www.wionews.com/sports/russia-could-face-olympic-ban-in-wada-decision-due-monday-266958">non-compliant</a> after the data handed over by the tainted Moscow laboratory was found to be "neither complete nor fully authentic".</p>
