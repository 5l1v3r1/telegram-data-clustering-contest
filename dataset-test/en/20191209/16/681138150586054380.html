        <b>Coventry City manager Mark Robins expects Ipswich Town to play with two up front in tomorrow night's FA Cup second round replay at Portman Road.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Will Keane has operated as the Blues' lone striker in the two recent 1-1 draws between the teams at St Andrew's, James Norwood having been suspended for Saturday's League One clash.</p>
      <p>"They've got a strong squad - have you seen the back of the programme?!" said Robins, speaking ahead of the two teams meeting for a third time in just 10 days.</p>
      <p>"He (Paul Lambert) will probably play two up front on Tuesday with (Kayden) Jackson and Norwood. Whether it's 3-5-2 or 4-4-2, which he likes, we'll wait and see. It could be a diamond. His Norwich team had a lot of success with that, I remember.</p>
      <p>"They have got Championship players but we've proved a match for them twice on our own patch. We now look forward to going to their place."</p>
      <p>Reflecting on Saturday's game, Robins said: "First half we just went brain dead. To go from being as bad as we were to as good as we were was incredible. We could have won 4-1."</p>
