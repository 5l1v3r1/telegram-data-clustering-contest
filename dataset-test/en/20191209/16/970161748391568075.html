      <h1>Saudi Arabia ditches rules separating women and men in restaurants</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:08:57+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">James Hockaday</a></address>
      <p>Women will no longer have to sit behind partitions at restaurants in Saudi Arabia, as the kingdom gradually eases its conservative social restrictions.</p>
      <p>For decades female diners have had to use separate entrances under the Gulf state’s hardline gender segregation rules.</p>
      <p>Restaurants and cafes, including major Western chains like Starbucks are segregated by ‘family’ sections for women out on their own and a ‘singles’ section just for men.</p>
      <p>Venues without enough space to uphold the strict religious law wouldn’t allow female customers in.</p>
      <p>But the rule has been scrapped after the country’s Municipal and Rural Affairs Ministry quietly made an announcement yesterday.</p>

      <p>The statement was published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, buried among a list of newly-approved technical requirements for various buildings including schools, stores and sports centres.</p>
      <p>It said the decisions were aimed at attracting investment and business opportunities in the country.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s announcement is likely to trouble more traditional Saudis who view gender segregation as a strict religious requirement, even though rules are not nearly as strict in neighbouring Islamic countries.</p>
      <p>Some restaurants and cafes in the coastal city of Jiddah and upscale hotels in the capital of Riyadh had already allowed men and women to sit freely.</p>
      <p>Although restaurants will no longer be forced to separate customers by gender, there is nothing stopping businesses from doing so if they wish.</p>
      <p>Across Saudi Arabia men unrelated men and women not mixing in public has been the norm.</p>

      <p>Most Government-run schools and public universities remain segregated as are most Saudi weddings.</p>
      <p>But in recent years Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salaman has pushed for sweeping social reform.</p>
      <p>Since August women have been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/02/women-finally-allowed-travel-without-husbands-permission-saudi-arabia-10505333/">allowed to travel abroad without a male guardian’s permission</a> in August and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=metro+saudi+arabia+driving&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_en&amp;oq=Metro+saudi+arabia+dri&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57.7199j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">to drive since June 2018. </a></p>
      <p>In recent years Saudi Arabia has allowed concerts, although <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/04/02/women-banned-from-dancing-and-swaying-inappropriately-at-saudi-pop-concert-7433979/">‘strict no-swaying rules still apply’,</a> and cinemas have re-opened.</p>
      <p>The first film to be screened in the country’s theatres in 35 years <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/16/saudi-arabias-first-cinema-screening-35-years-emoji-movie-7234956/">was The Emoji Movie.</a></p>
      <p>Two years ago women were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/10/30/saudi-arabia-is-finally-going-to-allow-women-into-its-sports-stadiums-7040052/">allowed to attend sports events for the first time</a> in ‘family’ sections of stadiums.</p>
      <p>Young girls in recent years have been allowed access to physical education and sports in school as well as boys.</p>
