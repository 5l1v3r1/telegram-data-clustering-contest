      <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said Tehran was "fully ready" for a full prisoner exchange with the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a>.</p>
      <p>Zarif's comments on Monday came two days after the US and Iran <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/iran-frees-chinese-american-scholar-held-iranian-scientist-191207110248789.html">swapped prisoners</a> in a rare act of cooperation between the longtime foes.</p>

      <p>"After getting our hostage back this week, fully ready for comprehensive prisoner exchange," Zarif wrote on Twitter, while in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>"The ball is in the US' court," he added.</p>

      <p>Saturday's exchange involved Xiyue Wang, a Chinese-born US citizen held in Iran since 2016, and Massoud Soleimani, an Iranian scientist detained in the US.</p>
      <p>Following the swap, which was negotiated indirectly and took place in neutral Switzerland, US President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> thanked  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a> for what he called a "very fair negotiation" after the transaction.  </p>
      <p>However, Iran's government dismissed the idea that it was the result of any negotiations between the two countries, which have not had diplomatic ties since 1980.</p>
      <p>"This was only an exchange and ... regarding exchanges we are ready to act but there are no negotiations," Iranian spokesman Ali Rabiei said on state television.</p>
      <p>"Negotiations or any kind of talks" can only take place "within the framework of the 5+1 and after America has refrained from sanctions and economic terrorism", he said.</p>
      <p>The P5+1 is the group of countries that agreed to a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. They are the five veto-wielding permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, namely the US, Britain, France, Russia and China, plus Germany. </p>
      <p>The nuclear deal has been hanging by a thread since last year, when Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord and began reimposing sweeping sanctions on the Iranian republic as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign to force it back to the negotiating table. </p>
      <p>Iran's government has long demanded that the US first drops the sanctions for it to return to negotiations under the auspices of the P5+1. Tehran has also taken several steps away from the unravelling nuclear deal following Washington's withdrawal and the reimposition of sanctions.</p>
      <p>Rabiei said the prisoner swap came despite a US rejection of an offer Tehran made to Washington last year for an exchange of all detainees.</p>
      <h3>Rouhani might visit Japan</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/japan.html">Japan</a>'s local media reported that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is likely to visit Tokyo this month, possibly on December 20, with some reports saying Washington has green-lighted the trip.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/shinzo-abe.html">Shinzo Abe</a> said on Monday his government had been weighing inviting Rouhani for a state visit.</p>
      <p>Japan has been trying to forge a possible mediator role as tensions rise between its ally Washington and Tehran.    </p>
      <p>"A visit by President Rouhani to Japan is now under consideration," Abe said at a news conference marking the end of the year's parliamentary session.    </p>
      <p>"Japan, which has an alliance with the US and at the same time has maintained favourable relations with Iran for a long time, must forge its own path," he said.    </p>
      <p>"I want to make diplomatic efforts as much as possible to help ease tensions and stabilise the situation in the region by continuing dialogue patiently," Abe added.</p>
      <p>If the trip is confirmed, Rouhani would become the first Iranian president to visit Japan since 2000.</p>
