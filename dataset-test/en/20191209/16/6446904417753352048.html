      <h1>Siptu and Unite members in Virgin Media vote to take industrial action</h1>
      <h2>Virgin Media said it has not received any notification from the unions.</h2>

      <p>SIPTU AND UNITE members currently employed by Virgin Media Ireland have voted in favour of taking industrial action. </p>
      <p>Siptu said today’s ballot, which includes action up to and including strike action, was taken in a dispute concerning compulsory redundancies.</p>
      <p>The company, which provides TV, mobile and broadband services, currently employs around 1,600 people. </p>
      <p>Siptu and Unite say they represent more than 350 members across all grades of staff in Virgin Media Ireland locations across the country – including call centre, technical, administration and sales staff.</p>
      <p>Siptu said its strike committee will meet next week in order to decide the nature of the industrial action the workers will undertake and when it will commence.</p>
      <p>Siptu organiser Rachel Keane said members remain open to negotiations with management “in order to achieve a just solution”.</p>
      <p>Virgin Media previously said “difficult decisions” had been made by the firm to keep up in what it had described as a “highly competitive market”. The company said that “it is envisaged that up to 65 roles may potentially be affected”. </p>
      <p>In a statement this evening, a spokesperson for Virgin Media said the company has not received any notification from the union, describing their threat of industrial action as unwarranted. </p>
      <p>“We believe this threat by the unions is totally unwarranted,  particularly when none of the recently announced redundancies occurred within the collective bargaining group. </p>
      <p>“For the record, the redundancy programme has now concluded and has resulted in 40 redundancies which was significantly lower number than the original estimate of 65,” the spokesperson concluded. </p>
      <p>Siptu disputes this claim and said its members are “extremely disappointed” that management has failed to engage with their union representatives to resolve this dispute.</p>
      <p>“This dispute concerns an attempt to impose compulsory redundancies and the failure by the company to implement a Labour Court recommendation concerning pay as well numerous breaches of a collective agreement which was agreed in 2008,” said Siptu organiser Martin Mannion. </p>
