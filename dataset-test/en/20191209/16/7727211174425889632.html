      <p>Former Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge has sent a strong message to fans in Turkey after objects were hurled onto the pitch.</p>
      <p>The striker was pictured removing three lighters during Trabzonspor's 3-1 win over Antalyaspor on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/daniel-sturridge">Sturridge,</a> who provided two assists during the match, took to Instagram to plead with supporters.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old wrote: "Away game = 3 points , 2 assists oh and 3 lighters, yes that is 3 lighters in my hand.</p>
      <p>"All jokes aside. Fans, please don’t Throw things on the pitch. The players safety shouldn’t be in danger from the fans and vice verse.</p>
      <p>"Rivalries in football are a big thing but it shouldn’t get to the level where you want to harm an oppositions player.</p>
      <p>"Setting a good example for the kids sitting next to you in the stadium will hopefully allow this to not happen regularly in the future, they will think it’s ok to act like that when it’s not.</p>

      <p>"You know I love The banter with fans but sometimes it’s a little too far. Much love anyway have a good start to the week."</p>
      <p>It has been a bright start to life in Turkey for Sturridge with the Englishman having notched two goals and registered four assists in six Super Lig appearances.</p>
      <p>Trabzonspor will travel to Switzerland to take on Basel on Thursday in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Having secured just one point in five games Sturridge's side have failed to qualify for the knockout stages of the competition.</p>
