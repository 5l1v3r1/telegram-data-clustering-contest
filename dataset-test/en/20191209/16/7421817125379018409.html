      <h3>In Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>State prosecutor requested the court for more time to find the missing document.</li>
        <li>Justice Ngugi directed that the case be postponed as the prosecution looks for the document.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A murder case involving three policemen from Olengurone in Nakuru County failed to proceed on Monday after an original copy of a post-mortem report went missing.</p>
      <p>The report, which was to be used by Government Pathologist Titus Ngulungu in court to establish the cause of Caren Chepkoech’s death went missing from the police file.</p>
      <p>Appearing before Justice Joel Ngugi in a Nakuru court, the suspects Silas Mutuma, Reuben Miano and Wycliffe Wangila declined to continue with the hearing of case until the original copy of the post-mortem report is availed in court.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MISSING DOCUMENT</b>
      </p>
      <p>“We request the prosecution to avail the document (post-mortem report) in court before the case can proceed,” said the suspects.</p>
      <p>State prosecutor requested the court for more time to find the missing document. Justice Ngugi directed that the case be postponed as the prosecution looks for the document.</p>
      <p>Mr Mutuma, Mr Miano and Mr Wangila are accused of jointly murdering Chepkoech a bar attendant on 8 July 2014 in Olengurone town, Nakuru County. The three are out on Sh500,000 bond each.</p>
      <p>Mr Charles Kiprop Ngeno, the owner of the bar, told the court that two police officers stormed the bar and arrested Chepkoech for allegedly operating past official hours.</p>
      <p>He said that the police officers told Chepkoech to give them a crate of beer before arresting her. He was informed that Chepkoech died after jumping from a moving police vehicle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ALREADY DEAD</b>
      </p>
      <p>A clinical officer at Olenguruone Sub County Hospital told the court that she was informed by a nurse on duty that some police officers had taken a patient to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The medic told the court that the nurse informed her the patient was already dead.</p>
      <p>The clinical officer said the victim’s body had no injuries apart from a wound on the back of the head. He said the wound was inflicted by a blunt object. The hearing will continue on February 19, 2020.</p>
