      <p><b>UAE – Mubasher:</b> As the clock is ticking towards the self-imposed deadline to ban single-use plastics, Dubai International Airport (DXB) is actively laying the groundwork to eliminate plastic cutlery and drinking straws.</p>
      <p>In June 2019, Dubai Airports vowed that Dubai’s two airports DXB and Dubai World Central (DWC) will be free of single-use plastics as from 1 January 2020.</p>
      <p>The operator of the world’s busiest airports has been working with over 250 of its hospitality and concession partners to implement the pledge by the beginning of the new year.</p>
      <p>"Among the challenges faced, the biggest is sourcing alternatives for plastic bottles, one of the most frequently used and discarded pieces of single-use plastics,” Dubai Airports’ executive vice president commercial Eugene Barry said.</p>
      <p>In the first phase of the pledge, cafés, restaurants and shops will no longer use plastic cutlery, take-away food packaging and polythene bags, while in the next 12 months, additional products will be replaced.</p>
      <p>“Along with our partners, including global brands such as McDonalds, Costa Coffee and Starbucks, we are committed to not only removing single-use plastics but in their place providing appropriate and importantly sustainable alternatives,” Barry said.</p>
      <p>Fast food giant McDonald’s said it will replace more than 5.6 million items with recyclable materials at the two airports, while Costa Coffee pledged to replace its plastic-lined cups with a fully renewable, plant-based “smart” cups.</p>
