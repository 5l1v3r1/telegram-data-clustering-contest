      <h2>Aston Villa news | After back-to-back defeats against Chelsea and Leicester, pressure is mounting on several of AVFC's starting Xi</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:17:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> fans feel the time is right for Dean Smith to give John McGinn a much-deserved rest.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international, started the season in stunning form, scoring three times in the opening month and a half of the campaign.</p>
      <p>However, since his goal at Burnley on September 28, McGinn has contributed just a solitary assist, in the defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>McGinn has been an ever present for Smith thus far, playing every minute of Villa’s opening 16 games.</p>

      <p>However, his form has tailed off in recent weeks and struggled to make any impact as Villa were dismantled 4-1 by Leicester City on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-live-leicester-city-17386110">In our weekly Q and A with Villa reporter Ashley Preece,</a> the question was asked whether McGinn should be taken out of the firing line.</p>
      <p>Ashley answered: “McGinn hasn’t been doing it ever since the international break. He looks shattered and, dare I say it, he’s been really ineffective in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice to take him out, but who comes in? Hourihane or Lansbury?</p>
      <p>“Given it’s all-action Sheffield United on Saturday, I think Villa will need McGinn in there, even though he’s looking sapped of energy. There’s no midweek game this week, which is a bonus.”</p>
      <p>And the fans on social media seem to agree, with many of them asking Smith to give the former Hibs man a break before the busy Chritstmas schedule.</p>
      <p><b>@LukeCarberry2:</b> Yup, been chasing shadows for a long time now because he's exhausted! Freshen it up a little maybe Lansbury grealish in the middle with trez and el ghazi wide!</p>
      <p><b>@MartinJ65590818:</b> Yes he needs a rest, that’s why they have a squad of players!!!!</p>
      <p><b>@MichaelJEdwar14:</b> Hasn’t played a decent game since since Grealish moved out wide and he signed that 5 year contract</p>
      <p><b>@DavidSmithMrbre:</b> Maybe needs a rest along with Wesley might get him back 2 his best firing on all cylinders again</p>

      <p><b>@Villa51Darren:</b> Yes been saying it for weeks now, and Wesley</p>
      <p><b>@D0ngasaurusRex:</b> Id say mings too but its looking like he'll be out anyway. Powerhause should come in. As should lansbury. With Mcginn looking shaky. Its not quite working for Wesley and maybe dropping him may give him the boost he needs and i mean Kodjia cant do much worse surely.</p>
      <p><b>@Saunders_Gaz:</b> Need to give him a rest,Lansbury chomping at the bit and give Wes a break too he’s getting worse by the game so it’s obviously affecting him and give Kodj a run for a few games</p>
      <p><b>@AJSFOunded:</b> Yes. No player should be a guaranteed starter if way out of form</p>

      <h3>Should John McGinn come out of Villa's starting XI against Sheffield United?</h3>
      <h4>0+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Yes, he needs a rest No, he should play every game Play him in this one, but he needs a rest soon</p>
      <p><b>@Michael76851525:</b> Maybe but refardless, he shouldn't be immune to being substituted. I thought when he was playing really well earlier in the season, he seemed to face after an hr and disappear but always stayed on the pitch. None of them should be above being taken off</p>
      <p><b>@Shy_Ry:</b> Yes no point waiting on a tired player to play himself back into form. Smith needs to apply the same rules all around. Conor had a bad game - bang you’re dropped, no one can feel they can’t be dropped.</p>
