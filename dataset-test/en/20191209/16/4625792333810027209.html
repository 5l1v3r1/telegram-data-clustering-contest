      <h1>GOP congressman leaves impeachment hearing after Democratic attorney calls Trump a 'danger'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:42:23+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author">Dominick Mastrangelo</a></address>
      <p>Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert stormed out of the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-judiciary-committee-holds-latest-impeachment-testimony">impeachment hearing</a> on Monday, according to a report from CNN.</p>
      <p>Gohmert, a Republican, shook his head and left the House Judiciary Committee hearing room after a lawyer for Democrats testified about Rudy Giuliani's recent trip to Ukraine, according to CNN reporter Manu Raju.</p>
      <p>“President Trump’s continuing effort ... is a clear and present danger to our national security,” House Judiciary Committee attorney Daniel Goldman said as Gohmert walked off.</p>

      <p>Gohmert has been a vocal defender of Trump during the impeachment investigation from Democrats. The <i>Washington Examiner</i> has reached out to Gohmert's office for comment on this report.</p>
      <p>Democrats are hoping to impeach Trump for what they say is an abuse of power relating to his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">July 25 phone call</a> with the president of Ukraine, during which Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate a political rival.</p>
      <p>Democrats have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/public-impeachment-hearings-havent-changed-minds-in-or-out-of-congress">spent recent weeks soliciting testimony</a> from foreign diplomats with knowledge of the call and the Trump administration's overall relations with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Republicans, like Gohmert, have dismissed most of their testimony as irreverent and "hearsay."</p>
      <p>“We need some factual witnesses," Gohmert said during a recent hearing in the Intelligence Committee. "We do not need to receive a report that we don't have a chance to read before this hearing."</p>
