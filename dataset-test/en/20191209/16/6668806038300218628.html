      <p>Akshay Kumar fans have a lot to be excited about since he’s got a pretty interesting line up of films coming up. Films like Good Newwz, Laxxmi Bomb, Prithviraj and Sooryavanshi seem to be projects that are right up his alley and have worked wonders for him in the past. From these films, it is Sooryavanshi that has got us excited the most since we’ll see Akshay return to a cop avatar after Rowdy Rathore. And if that wasn’t enough, we have something even more special in store for you.</p>

      <p>We’ve been informed that the director of Sooryavanshi, Rohit Shetty wants to shoot a song with Akshay for the film which will also include Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh. Ajay and Ranveer have worked with Rohit before in the films Singham and Simmba respectively. With Sooryavanshi, Rohit Shetty seems to be building his very own cop universe which is why he wants the three of them to feature together. While Ajay had a cameo in the film Simmba as Singham, we also got a tiny glimpse of Akshay as Sooryavanshi. So, watching these three superstars groove together on screen is something we definitely are looking forward to. <br/><br/>Sooryavanshi will also bring back the much loved pairing of Katrina Kaif and Akshay Kumar. The film is slated to release on 27th March 2020.</p>
