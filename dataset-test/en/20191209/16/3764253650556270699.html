        <b>It appears that December 2019 in the Nigerian entertainment industry would be one to remember for a very long time going by the number of <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1219307-4-types-drama-literature.html">drama</a> fans have experienced in the lives of celebrities on social media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nigerian media personality and self-acclaimed baby girl for life, Toke Makinwa, recently dropped her crown for a few minutes to call out film maker, Yomi Black, after he had dragged her on social media.</p>
      <p>It all started when Toke agreed with a post that claimed Nigerians are hypocrites for hailing Cardi B but slamming their own celebs who would dare to live life the way the American rapper does.</p>

      <p>Well, Yomi Black then took to his own Instagram page to share a caption on how Toke’s post is the most hypocritical in 2019. <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1282669-yomi-black-dares-toke-makinwa-explain-affords-luxuries.html">The post had dared the media personality to beat her chest and boast of how she makes money</a> to afford her luxurious lifestyle.</p>

      <p>The post had also warned Toke not to claim that she makes her money from endorsements or from being a media personality.</p>
      <p>However, it seems Toke was very well prepared as she brought guns to a knife fight after she called out Yomi Black in a now deleted post on her Instagram page.</p>
      <p>The media girl shared a DM Yomi had sent her since 2017 and she recounted all the times she had helped him with his career despite him not having the money to pay back. Toke proceeded to calling him an ungrateful fool and asking who he has ever helped in his life.</p>
      <p>See a screenshot of her now deleted post below:</p>

      <p>Read her lengthy caption below:</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Excuse me while I drop my crown for 5 minutes. Inside life…… this life is a pot of beans. Now this is a public service announcement, if I have ever supported you with my time, platform, money, and more pls don’t ever come for me. You look stupid when you try.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Some of you will be all up in the DM looking for favors yet want to sound Intelligent in these SM streets. Should we really tell Nigerians how you went from licking my as*s to dragging me online? This world we live in is strange, I have messages from you like this one, I would usually look away cos you are not the first but Yomi, you ungrateful fool, I have worked with you on projects with only a promise of “i”ll pay you back when we find sponsors”, which you never did, and I let it go, I have stuck my neck out for you when stylists, designers and the likes wanted your head on a platter cos you made them work without pay, when all you had was a dream,”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I was willing to support you with my platform, I have fed cast and crew on your shameless sham of a set and you have the nerve to come for me???? I have receipts of how much of a loser you are but I’ll leave this one here, you asked for free TM bags for a product placement on your production which I turned down cos I’m sorry your platform does nothing for me, and I am running a business, I asked you to pay for it and you got mad, you’ve always taken but never given to anyone, who have you helped??? Who have you supported? it’s always been the other way round, you couldn’t get a freebie and now i am your enemy? Tell me, if I’m everything you say I am, why do you want to associate yourself with me? I was such an inspiration to you in private huh???? See my people hustle oooo so you don’t go from “you’re such an inspiration” to this”.</i>
