      <p>The <a href="https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/lvxlol/discover-the-collection/lvxlol-the-collection/_/N-yyd2rt/to-2">Louis Vuitton and <i>League of Legends</i> collection</a> has finally dropped, and as expected, nothing comes cheap.</p>
      <p>The apparel seems to be loosely based off of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/29/20936513/league-of-legends-louis-vuitton-skin-true-damage-qiyana-prestige">True Damage Qiyana Prestige Edition skin</a>, with the champion herself appearing on t-shirts and dresses. Pulling from Louis Vuitton branding, all of the items for sale have the iconic flower and star pattern. They also all have a tiger stripe pattern overlaying it on several items. While we’re not entirely sure what the colored stripes have to do with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/league-of-legends/40334"><i>League of Legends</i></a>, it’s a pretty dope look.</p>

      <p>The prices are steep, but that’s not surprising given the usual pricing of Louis Vuitton items. The LVxLoL joggers are $1,610. The zip-up hoodie is $2,420. The dress that looks similar to Qiyana’s is $2,280. The most expensive item in the collection, <a href="https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/products/lvxlol-leather-biker-jacket-nvprod2000039v">a leather biker jacket</a>, costs $5,650. With an average<i> League of Legends</i> skin costing $10-15, one Louis Vuitton shirt would be equivalent to ... (<i>does the math</i>) a lot of skins.</p>
      <p>The collection is obviously aimed at a very small subsection of the <i>League of Legends</i> fan base that is into luxury brands, but man, does it have me wishing I had more money.</p>
      <p>Louis Vuitton also made <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/culture/2019/9/23/20876278/louis-vuitton-league-of-legends-skins-riot-games">a carrying case for the 2019 <i>League of Legends</i> World Championships</a> trophy. A Prestige Edition for the <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-skins/2019/10/29/20919723/true-damage-akali-senna-qiyana-yasuo-ekko-skins-giants">True Damage Senna skin</a>, which will also have a Louis Vuitton design, will release sometime in 2020.</p>
