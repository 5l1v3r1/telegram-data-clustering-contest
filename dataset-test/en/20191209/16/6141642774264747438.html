      <p>A protester has disrupted the opening of impeachment hearings into US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler was interrupted by a protester shouting “we voted for Donald Trump” as the panel opened.</p>
      <p>The protester was escorted from the House of Representatives hearing room by police.</p>

      <p>The committee is to vote soon, possibly this week, on two or more charges of abuse of power, bribery and obstruction against the Republican president.</p>
      <p>Democrats say Mr Trump’s push to have Ukraine investigate rival Joe Biden while at the same time withholding US military aid contradicted US policy and benefited Russia.</p>
      <p>The top Republican on the panel, representative Doug Collins, derided the hearing as a “sham” and said Democrats are racing to jam impeachment through on a “clock and a calendar” ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p>

      <p>The hearing sets off a pivotal week as Democrats march towards a full House vote expected by Christmas.</p>
      <p>Mr Nadler said the case against Mr Trump is clear after “multiple officials testified that the president’s demand for an investigation into his rivals was a part of his personal, political agenda, and not related to the foreign policy objectives of the United States”.</p>
      <p>He said: “The integrity of our next election is at stake.”</p>

      <p>Mr Trump spent the weekend tweeting about the proceedings. He and and his allies acknowledge he is likely to be impeached in the Democratic-controlled House but they also expect acquittal next year in the Senate, where Republicans have a majority.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump’s team is turning attention elsewhere, including Monday’s release of a long-awaited US Justice Department report into the 2016 Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>“Impeachment Hearing Hoax,” Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In advance of the hearing, Mr Nadler sent a letter to the White House officially forwarding the House Intelligence Committee’s report, along with additional evidence supporting impeachment. It also invited White House officials to review sensitive materials in a classified setting.</p>
      <p>The White House is refusing to participate in the process it calls a sham, and Mr Collins asked to postpone the hearing, criticising Democrats for moving too swiftly.</p>
