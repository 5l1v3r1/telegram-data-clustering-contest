      <p>The South African Communist Party (SACP) plans to start its special national congress on Monday with discussions focussing on whether the party is prepared to contest the next general elections and if its leaders are permitted to serve in cabinet.</p>
      <p>The congress is planning to review the pmplemtation of resolutions taken since the SACP’s national congress two years ago. SACP’s spokesperson Alex Mashilo said there were a number of issues that would be discussed at the congress.</p>
      <p>“Congress will pay attention to the reality prevailing at the current moment. Unemployment has risen, poverty and inequality remain entrenched,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The resolution called for the reconfiguration of the alliance and the SACP to lead a process to establish a popular left front. What the special national congress will do is to assess progress in the implementation of that resolution,” he said.</p>
