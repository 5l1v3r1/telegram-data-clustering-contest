      <p>“I honestly haven’t seen him since we broke up. Which is crazy,” Ashanti shared. Cohen chimed in, “Well let’s bring him out, everybody! Just kidding.” Cohen’s joke had Ashanti laughing hysterically.</p>
      <p>Another fan wrote in and asked about <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/535306/irv-gotti-tells-wendy-williams-ashanti-is-not-a-homewrecker/">Irv Gotti addressing their affair</a> on “The Wendy Williams Show”. Ashanti expertly dodged the question.</p>

      <p>Ashanti and Nelly had a nine-year relationship that ended in 2012.</p>
