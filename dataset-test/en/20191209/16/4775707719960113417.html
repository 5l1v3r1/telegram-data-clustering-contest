      <p>Today marks a month of <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare/achievements">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's</a> occupation of the top spot in our chart. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Fortnite/achievements">Fortnite</a> remains at no. 2, whilst <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Minecraft/achievements">Minecraft,</a> usually a solid contender in the top three spots, has now dropped out of the top five completely. The big mover this week is Halo: The Master Chief Collection, thanks to the launch of Halo Reach on consoles and PC.</p>
      <p>Here is the top 40 Xbox Gameplay Chart for the week ending 08 December 2019.</p>

      <p>Halo Reach joined the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Halo-The-Master-Chief-Collection/achievements">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> last week, and is most likely responsible for the MCC's meteoric rise from no. 22, bypassing 18 spots to land at no. 4. Halo Reach had been requested by fans for some time, so perhaps we won't be seeing the MCC fall anytime soon. Even if it did, since It's likely we'll see it shoot back up again once it's joined by Halo: Combat Evolved. Combat Evolved hopefully shouldn't be too far behind, especially as Halo Community Director Brian Jarrard <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39760/halo-mcc-combat-evolved-release-date-pc">said</a> that the PC Beta should be starting soon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Rocket-League/achievements">Rocket League</a> has risen by one place to no. 7, despite the decidedly uneven response to their new Blueprints system, which was introduced to replace Crates. If you missed what that was all about, we've <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39572/rocket-league-blueprints-loot-boxes">detailed the new system</a> and covered some of the more <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n40022/rocket-league-blueprint-pricing">ridiculously priced cosmetics</a>. The MCC's flight into the top five has displaced many games below, with <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Apex-Legends/achievements">Apex Legends,</a> <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/ROBLOX/achievements">ROBLOX,</a> <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Destiny-2/achievements">Destiny 2,</a> <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Forza-Horizon-4/achievements">Forza Horizon 4</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Overwatch/achievements">Overwatch</a> all falling by one place. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Red-Dead-Redemption-2/achievements">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> remains at no. 16. Red Dead Online was greatly improved by Frontier Pursuits, which let players choose to be Bounty Hunters, Collectors, or Traders. The upcoming addition of a <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39937/red-dead-online-moonshiner">new Frontier Pursuit, Moonshiners,</a> could see Red Dead Online start to move back up the ranks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Star-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order/achievements">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> has proven popular, and has met with some great reviews, and yet it has dropped six places to no. 19. Last week it had only dropped by one place, and so we might be seeing the usual sad but seemingly inescapable fate of all single-player games in our chart, which never fare very well alongside multiplayer titles.<a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Borderlands-3/achievements"> Borderlands 3</a> has also taken quite a hit, and dropped six places to no. 21. However, the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39775/borderlands-3-dlc-release-date-handsome-jack">first major DLC</a> for the game releases in ten days on December 19th, and so it's possible we'll see Borderlands 3 lifted up a little by that. It's called Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot, and is about her attempt to loot the glitzy casino owned by her ex-husband, Handsome Jack.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/My-Friend-Pedro/achievements">My Friend Pedro</a> has made its debut in the charts following its release last week, coming in at no. 26. My Friend Pedro is a shoot 'em up game where the player is acting out the whims of a sentient banana. It's unclear why, or how this banana has such control over the player character, but My Friend Pedro is on <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Game Pass</a> now, and so if you're curious and have a Game Pass membership, you can find out for yourselves. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Outer-Worlds/achievements">The Outer Worlds</a> continues to fall, this week by four places to no. 27. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Brawlhalla/achievements">Brawlhalla</a> has made a surprise re-entry at no. 35. It's not entirely clear where this sudden bump in interest has come from; the only recent news for Brawlhalla seems to be that they've added in some characters from the TV show Steven Universe, if that's your thing. Lower down, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Monster-Hunter-World/achievements">Monster Hunter: World</a> has also re-emerged at no. 39. Capcom are constantly adding to or updating their action RPG game; the recent Iceborne expansion is an example of this, as there's always new monsters, regions or armour being added. The most recent <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/update/mhw/us/ver12_01.html">Title Update</a> added two new monsters and a tempered version of a third, plus new armour, and a whole new region of the Guiding Lands. Perhaps it's this content which is responsible for bumping Monster Hunter back up into the top 40.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, we've got a couple of releases, DLCs, and additions to Game Pass which might change things up again on our chart. The addition of the hugely successful Witcher 3 to Game Pass on December 19th should have an impact. The Borderlands 3 DLC releases on the same day, and so we might see some shufflings in the weeks after to account for that. We've also got the upcoming Return to Jurassic Park DLC for Jurassic World Evolution. Meanwhile, the final episode for Life is Strange 2 has just recently released, as has Terminator Resistance. It's possible we could see some interesting movement from these December releases.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
