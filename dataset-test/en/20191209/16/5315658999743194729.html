      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Minister of Civil Defence Peeni Henare have today confirmed initial Government support of $100,000 for communities affected by the severe weather that swept across the South Island and lower North Island over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The contribution will be made to Mayoral relief funds across the country to help with response and recovery efforts, and follows $50,000 of funding to support farming communities in the South Canterbury district yesterday.</p>
      <p>“The disruption to lives and livelihoods, especially for those in hardest hit South Canterbury and the West Coast, has been substantial,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
      <p>“Our immediate priority is the safety and wellbeing of those affected first hand – the communities, the farmers, the tourists.</p>
      <p>“Further Government support may be needed once a full assessment of damage is complete,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
      <p>Minister Henare, who is on the West Coast today, said he’s seen transport links severed, travellers stranded, interruptions to power, mobile and internet services, and widespread damage.</p>
      <p>“This funding assistance will help those communities to get back on their feet, as locals are best-placed to know exactly what they need right now,” Peeni Henare said.</p>
      <p>A clearer picture of damage is expected once a New Zealand Defence Force P-3 Orion aircraft has completed its survey of the area. NZDF is also on stand-by to provide travel support if no commercial solutions are available.</p>
      <p>The National Emergency Management Agency has activated its memorandum of understanding with Airbnb, providing free accommodation for displaced people in Timaru and Ashburton and on the West Coast.</p>
