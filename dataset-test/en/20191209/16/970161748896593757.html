      <h1>Only Bella Hadid can wear a sheer top and white jeans to the beach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:56:52+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Mel Evans</a></address>
      <p>Only the bravest of sartorial lions will go for the white jeans look, but somehow Bella Hadid rocked a pair of light denim with a sheer top to the beach – and made it work.</p>
      <p>2009 style, but make it beach fashion, we suppose.</p>
      <p>The Victoria’s Secret model has hit the snooze button on life as she took some time out in St Barts this week, donning a rather peculiar beachside dress code.</p>
      <p>While her seaside comrades would usually opt for the more traditional wear of bikini or swimsuit, or, heck, at least a pair of board shorts, Bella, 23, said sod off to the saltwater norms and put on her most impractical beach threads.</p>
      <p>Wearing a white, meshy, see-through halter top, she evidently decided by going sheer on the top she needed to go heavy on the bottom and so put on a pair of white, straight-leg jeans. The kind we stopped wearing in 2009 when we realised white trousers attract all types of unsavoury stains.</p>

      <p>She then added a pair of lightly tinted sunglasses that will do nothing to protect her corneas from UV rays. But that’s fashion, we suppose.</p>
      <p>The woman was somewhat feeling herself, as she posed up against a tree, wanting to document her all-white, summertime ensemble while she could.</p>

      <p>Because, let’s face it, that outfit will stay white for all of 10 minutes before the sand enacts its plans of outfit domination.</p>
      <p>Clearly, we do beach days very differently from Miss Hadid.</p>
      <p>It comes after she continued her whole ‘life’s a beach’ schtick where she was<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/bella-hadid-drinking-martini-looking-photoshoot-ready-beach-st-barts-whole-mood-11409560/"> spotted drinking a martini from a cocktail glass</a> in the sea like it ain’t no thing over the weekend.</p>

        <figcaption>Cheers to you, Bella (Picture: BACKGRID)</figcaption>

      <p>Wearing a cut-out one piece – think of the tan lines! – she cut quite the relaxed figure, with her hair swept back into a wet bun, having donned another pair of teeny tiny sunglasses. She then hung out on a paddleboard somehow making lounging on a flotation device look effortless.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we’re here writing this in the freezing cold temperatures of London, wearing multiple layers underneath a puffa coat and knowing this weather is only going to get worse…</p>
      <p>Cheers to you, Bella – you’re doing it right.</p>
