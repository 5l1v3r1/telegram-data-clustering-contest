      <h1>Democracy NGO casts doubts over Orban's 2018 supermajority in Hungary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:40:08+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Sandor Zsiros</a></address>
      <p>Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban has been in power since 2010, and last year won a supermajority for the third time - but a year-long investigation by an electoral monitoring group has cast doubts on the legitimacy of his 2018 landslide.</p>
      <p>NGO Unhack Democracy Europe claims Orban’s Fidesz party may not have its two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament without manipulation and fraud.</p>
      <p>Activists from the group interviewed 170 opposition ballot counting officers, and they heard reports of a wide range of malpractice, including vote buying, intimidation, forged logs, and voters being brought in from neighbouring countries.</p>

      <p>Garvan Walshe, the chair of Unhack Democracy Europe told Euronews: "There has been talk of pressure coming from the centre and the pattern of incidents suggests that it was not isolated cases but a national phenomenon."</p>
      <p>“It suggests a sustained pressure; whether this is happening out of a central direction or whether this is happening out of initiative, we don't know, but it's clearly happening."</p>
      <p>According to Zsofia Banuta, a researcher for Unhack Democracy Europethe findings "reveal a wide range of malpractice and irregularities and outright fraud across the country including vote buying, intimidation of voters and ballot counters as well.</p>
      <p>She added they had heard of "forged voter logs, and the bussing of voters from across the border from Serbia, Ukraine and Romania".</p>

      <p>Euronews has asked the Hungarian government, the national election office and Fidesz for comment.</p>
