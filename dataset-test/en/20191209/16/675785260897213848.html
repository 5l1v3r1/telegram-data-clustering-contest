      <h1>Jorge Masvidal names fight preference out of Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor</h1>
      <h2>Mayweather and McGregor are both returning to action in 2020 after extended periods away from their respective sports, and Masvidal has pinpointed which of the pair he wants to fight most</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:13:57+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jorge-masvidal">Jorge Masvidal</a> is hoping to build on a successful year in the Octagon by lining up fights with Floyd Mayweather and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> in 2020.</p>
      <p>The American welterweight has won all three of his bouts this year, with his latest victory coming against one of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor's</a> nemeses Nate Diaz.</p>
      <p>But when discussing potential clashes with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/floyd-mayweather">Mayweather</a> and McGregor, Masvidal made it clear there was one fighter he wished to face more than the other.</p>
      <p>“[McGregor] is one of the lottery tickets we’re possibly going to cash on in," Masvidal <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/jorge-masvidal-makes-hard-pitch-for-floyd-mayweather-fight/">told TMZ</a> . "It’s not the biggest lottery ticket, but it’s one of the lottery tickets."</p>
      <p>Asked what would trump a bout with McGregor, he replied: "Me versus Mayweather."</p>

      <p>He added: "I want cash money. I got children and those children’s got needs. I love to fight and one of my first loves growing up was boxing, and then I fell in love with wrestling and then UFC came about.</p>
      <p>"And I was like, ‘Wow, I can do them both of them at the same damn time.’ I fell in love with the UFC and that’s all I’ve done, the MMA. But I can box my a** off."</p>
      <p>Masvidal then claimed he would not fade like McGregor did in his superfight with Mayweather in 2017, and stated he would have "bad intentions" of trying to hurt the unbeaten boxer were they to step into the ring together.</p>

      <p>Mayweather announced he would be returning to the boxing ring in 2020 despite previously announcing his retirement.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old is unbeaten in 50 professional fights, but no details have yet been released on his potential comeback.</p>
      <p>Masvidal added: "Mayweather’s done so much. I could never discredit so much. I could never discredit that guy. He’s done tremendous things. I’ve grown up watching the guy. He’s a hell of a star.</p>
      <p>"If he wants to fight someone that’s gonna come give it his all and try to execute him and get him out of there…because that’s the only thing I’m trying to do is turn his lights off…it’s me, man.”</p>
