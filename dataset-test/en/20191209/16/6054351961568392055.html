      <h1>Cardi B Declares 'I Feel Like People Are Just So Tired Of Me Winning'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:16:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/JustinI" target="_blank">Justin Ivey</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53675/title.cardi-b-vouches-for-offsets-social-media-hack">Cardi B</a> opened up about the current pressure she’s facing in her career in a <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/cardi-b-cover-january-2020">Vogue</a> magazine cover story. While reflecting on the perceived disappointment of her 2019 single <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51628/title.cardi-b-drops-press-single">“Press,”</a> which peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, the Atlantic Records artist admitted she feels like many onlookers want to see her success stop.</p>
      <p>“I thought ‘Press’ was fun and it was gangsta, and then because it didn’t perform as good as my other songs, people was like, Oh, she’s a flop; oh, she’s dying out,” she said. “This whole year has just been a lot for me. I feel like people are just so tired of me winning. I will look for my name on Twitter, and it’s like hate tweets, hate tweets, hate tweets.”</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Cardi explained how the creation of her <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51047/title.dxclusive-cardi-b-admits-to-feeling-pressure-to-avoid-sophomore-slump">sophomore album</a> has been much harder than her debut <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.3125/title.review-cardi-bs-invasion-of-privacy-has-blockbuster-aspirations-decent-results"><i>Invasion Of Privacy</i></a>. She spoke on the balancing act she’s faced with following her breakthrough LP, which won a Grammy Award and dominated the Billboard charts.</p>
      <p>“The first time it was just me being myself,” she noted. “I didn’t even care if people was gonna like it or not. When I found out I did so good, I’m like, is this a big number? Everybody was like, yes, this is a huge number. So it’s scary because it’s like, now you got to top your first album, and then it’s like, damn. I wonder if people are gonna relate to the new things, to the new life, to the new shit that I gotta talk about now.”</p>
      <p>Cardi added, “Music is changing. I feel like people just wanna hear twerk-twerk music, but it’s like, is that just a phase? I probably need a sexy song. I need a lot of turn-up songs. I need a slow song, a personal song. And those are harder for me—I always need help when it comes to talking about my feelings. It’s hard for me to be soft, period. So it’s a lot of thoughts, a lot of pressure. It’s really like a job.”</p>
