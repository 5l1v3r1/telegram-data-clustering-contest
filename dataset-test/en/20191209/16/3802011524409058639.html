      <h1>Sky TV and Netflix get a new rival: new streaming service revealed and it’s FREE to watch</h1>
      <h2>Plex has launched a new video on-demand service that lets you stream movies from any device. Unlike Amazon Prime, Sky Go, Netflix and a host of other movie services, there is one very stark difference with the Plex rival… it’s completely free.</h2>

      <p>Yes, you did just read that right. Plex doesn’t want a penny for the streaming service, which boasts a library of thousands of Hollywood blockbusters, television shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, Bollywood musicals and more.</p>
      <p>Plex announced back in September that it had teamed up with Warner Bros to start to deliver ad-supported content by the end of the year. The service has now launched with its first wave of movies and TV shows, with the promise of more partnerships – and therefore, content – to come soon.</p>

      <p>The ad-supported movie streaming service is available right now in more than 200 countries. All you need is a Plex account, which is also free to set-up.</p>
      <p>There are no paid subscription tiers, so you won’t even be asked to cough up some cash to unlock Ultra HD, streaming on multiple devices, or any number of other capabilities that rival streaming services keep locked behind a paid subscription tier.</p>
      <p>Plex’s library of free-to-watch includes content from the major Hollywood studios, including Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM), Lionsgate, Legendary and Warner Bros. themselves.</p>
      <p>You’ll find movies like American Ultra, Frequency, Lord of War, Rain Man, Raging Bull, The Terminator, Thelma &amp; Louise and Apocalypse Now, with more movies being added all the time.</p>
      <p>For those who don’t know, until now, Plex has been a media library service designed to help you keep your own video content organised and available to stream on any of your devices.</p>
      <p>Using the desktop client, users can keep their TV shows and movies stored and searchable by directors, actors and more. Downloading the Plex app on your iPhone, Android, iPad, set-top box, or other hardware allows you to access the library of content and then stream from your own server.</p>
      <p>Plex offers a paid-subscription service called Plex Pass that unlocks some additional features, including synchronisation with mobile devices, cloud storage, metadata fetching for music, support for multiple users, parental controls, and more.</p>
      <p>This is nothing to do with the new movie streaming service, which is listed as Free to Watch under the Movies &amp; TV tab within the Plex app.</p>
