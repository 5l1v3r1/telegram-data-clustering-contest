        <b>Under-pressure Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti said "a coach's suitcase is always ready" ahead of Tuesday's crunch final Champions League group game against Genk.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Italian side host the Belgian outfit at the Stadio San Paolo looking to end their nine-match winless streak and book their place in the Champions League last 16.</p>
      <p>The Serie A runners-up are seventh in the Italian league, with their last win coming in October's Champions League victory at Salzburg.</p>
      <p>"The suitcase of a coach is always ready, you can never unpack it," said the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich boss on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I think that for a coach to be questioned in this kind of situation is completely normal," he continued amid reports former AC Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso was ready to take his place.</p>
      <p>"I'm ready, it's an experience I've already experienced in the past. It doesn't scare me, and it doesn't worry me that the club could sack me or that I could leave," he added.</p>
      <p>Napoli beat European champions Liverpool in their opening Group E clash before drawing at Anfield in November, but still need a point in their final game to qualify for the knock-out stages.</p>
      <p>"I can't pretend, the team doesn't give what it could give," Ancelotti said.</p>
      <p>"In Europe, we have seen another Napoli, the one I would like to see in the league as well. I am looking for solutions to get out of this difficult period," he added.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti, who has won three Champions League titles as a coach, twice with AC Milan and once with Real Madrid, denied his team had a "psychological block".</p>
      <p>"The team is worried because of what they cannot do. They gave the best of themselves against Liverpool, when the weight of responsibility was less," he said.</p>
      <p>"I have the feeling that tomorrow we will have a great game and we will go into the next round and hopefully in first place."</p>
      <p>Napoli are second in their group, one point behind leaders Liverpool who travel to Salzburg, who are third two points behind the Italians.</p>
