      <h1>Sad Moment For Kumaraswamy: JD(S) Fails To Win A Single Seat In Karnataka Bypolls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:09:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>Karnataka's regional party Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) is facing a total rout in the state Assembly bypolls, as it failed to open account even in the 12 seats it contested on 5 December separately, a party official admitted.</p>
      <p>"Our candidates are trailing behind the BJP in Yeshvanthpur in Bengaluru east and Krishnarajapete in Mandya district and the Congress in Hunasuru in Mysuru district," JD-S general secretary Ramesh Babu told <i>IANS</i>.</p>
      <p>Breaking away from its former coalition alliance partner Congress, the JD-S contested separately against the ruling BJP and the Congress in dozen seats.</p>
      <p>"Independent Sharath Kumar Bachegowda, whom we have supported by not fielding our candidate, is leading in Hosakote in Bengaluru Rural district over BJP's M T B Nagaraj, who defected from the Congress," asserted Babu.</p>
      <p>Nagaraj is the richest candidate in the by-elections as he declared a whopping Rs 1,230 crore worth assets in his poll affidavit last month.</p>
      <p>The party did not contest in Athani and Yellapura seats in the state's northwest region.</p>
      <p>The JD-S, which won 36 seats in the May 2018 Assembly elections, came to power in the southern state after 12 years in a post-poll alliance with the Congress, which allowed H D Kumaraswamy to become the chief minister for the second time.</p>
      <p>Resignation of 14 Congress and three JD-S rebel legislators in mid-July, however, led to the fall of the 14-month-old fledgling coalition government on 23 July after Kumaraswamy lost the confidence vote in the 225-member Assembly.</p>
      <p>"We accept the verdict of the people in all humility and will analyse our party's position in the state after reviewing the results in the by-elections," Babu added.</p>
