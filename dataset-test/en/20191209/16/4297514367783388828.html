      </p>
      <p>The B.C. Coroner’s Service is asking for the public’s help in identifying a man found dead in the Peace region early last month.</p>
      <p>In a Monday morning news release, the agency said it was having trouble identifying a man found in a farmer’s field 10 kilometres northeast of Moberly Lake on Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Mounties have deemed the man’s death not suspicious and believe he died earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The coroner believes the man under the age of 40 when he died. At the time of death he was wearing a camouflage-style shirt, blue True Religion-brand jeans and size 11 Nike Air Max running shoes.</p>
      <p>The agency is asking anyone who may be able to identify the man to call the Fort St. John RCMP at 250 787-8140, or the B.C. Coroners Service’s at 1-877-660-5077 or by email at <a href="mailto:bccs.siu@gov.bc.ca">bccs.siu@gov.bc.ca</a>.</p>
