      <p>'If large group of young men in masks roamed the streets on any other night of the year, the police would be called out in an instant,' said an historian.</p>
      <p>Austrian authorities are trying, and apparently failing, to stay one step ahead of drunken demons bedeviling the local populace this time of year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/08/austria-struggles-with-marauding-krampus-day-demons-gone-rogue"><i>The Guardian</i></a> reports. Which is to say, Christmastime is when men dress like the Christmas demon Krampus and then get drunk and go off-script, in a manner of speaking, tormenting and scaring passerby in a way that goes beyond good fun.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s a Krampus?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the U.S., there’s Santa Claus and his eight tiny reindeer, and that’s it. However, in European Christian tradition, Santa — or Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, or whatever he’s called in the local legend — is often accompanied by his antithesis. As previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5203316/why-doesnt-america-have-a-krampus-why-does-the-demon-only-torment-european-christian-children/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, where Santa, the jolly elf based on a real Turkish Christian saint, bestows gifts and treats to well-behaved children, his opposite, the goat-horned demon Krampus, lurks about to punish bad children. Depending on which legend you “believe,” Krampus will beat them, drown them, eat them, or drag them to hell.</p>
      <p>These days, Krampus is considered good fun, as much as a demonic child murderer can be considered “fun.” Many European cities see him as an excuse to hold Krampus parades, where revelers — mostly men — get hammered, dress as Krampus, and stroll through town, scaring naught kids (and adults).</p>

        <b>A National Prank</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Austria, it’s not uncommon for Krampus to kind of lurk about on his own during the Christmas season. That is, absent a parade, a man may dress as Krampus and pop out from behind a hiding place to playfully scare kids or adults. Think of it as a national prank.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Going Off-Script</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, throw in a few too many tall cold ones and Krampus scares go from being good Christmas fun to assault.</p>
      <p>In Carinthia, for example, drunken men dressed as Krampus have assaulted people with birch branches, including at least one incident that left an 11-year-old child with a bloody cut on their thigh. In Sterzing, a Krampus parade went awry and ended with revelers fleeing in terror as drunken Krampuses mercilessly beat a man on the ground. In Klagenfurt, two firefighters were bedeviled by a group of drunken Krampuses who beat them with sticks.</p>

      <p>Peter Wiesflecker, an historian of Austrian culture and customs, says that the situation is testing the patience of police.</p>
      <p>“If large group of young men in masks roamed the streets on any other night of the year, the police would be called out in an instant,” he said.</p>
      <p>Aleksander Andonov, who heads the Anif Krampus Association, has instituted rules for the Krampuses who work for him. Alcohol isn’t allowed; they’re only allowed to lightly brush their “victims” with cows’ tails or birch branches; and parades in which his association participates must set up Krampus-free zones so scared children can have a safe space.</p>
      <p>“The aim of the Krampus is not to hurt people. On the contrary: we want to take away their fear. In the end, good always wins over evil,” he said.</p>
