      <p>In this flashback, Nick Cannon shared his thoughts on Conway's reaction to Lord Jamar saying that white people, including Eminem, are guests in the house of hip-hop. After pointing out that Eminem is in his top-five rappers list, Nick went on to speak about how he agrees with Lord Jamar, saying, "Which is a fact." Nick also agreed with DJ Vlad telling Conway that the hood didn't listen to Eminem, which led to a conversation about teenage girls deciding who is a huge superstar because they are a large market that buys merchandise and tickets to shows.
