      <h3>Discover Las Vegas</h3>
      <p>While it can be fun to explore the famous Las Vegas Strip after nightfall, there are still a number of fun things to do during the day. For example, there are a plethora of fun pool parties to attend, as well as places to shop, dine, and enjoy beverages.</p>
      <p>In addition, Las Vegas offers some of the best entertainment in the world every night of the week. Whether you are looking to see a musical, a magic show, a band, or a DJ, Vegas has it all. The city also offers a number of fun things to try just outside of the strip that include everything from the Grand Canyon to Old Las Vegas to ghost towns.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> While the low-cost carrier is an extremely affordable alternative, it is worthwhile to note that <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/01/19/canada-budget-friendly-airlines-costs/">there are a number of additional costs</a>. For one, luggage will cost extra, as will selecting your own seat or even speaking to an operator. As such, it is worthwhile to factor in what you need to bring, or if you want to sit in a particular spot.</p>
