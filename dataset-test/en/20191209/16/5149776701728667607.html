      <h1>'Unfortunately' - Nottingham Forest boss Sabri Lamouchi reveals injury latest</h1>
      <h2>Reds head coach with the latest injury news on Samba Sow, Yuri Ribeiro and Carl Jenkinson ahead of Middlesbrough clash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:59:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest will again be without the injured trio of Samba Sow, Yuri Ribeiro and Carl Jenkinson for tomorrow’s clash with Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Sow has been sidelined since October with a hamstring problem, while Jenkinson has been out since August with an ankle injury and fellow full-back Ribeiro (knee) since the clash with Derby County last month.</p>
      <p>Head coach Sabri Lamouchi had been hoping for positive news on the injury front this week, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/forest-vs-boro-injury-news-3621916">ahead of successive home games</a> with Boro and Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately no,” he said, when asked if any of the absent players would be available for the midweek match.</p>
      <p>“For Yuri, for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/samba-sow">Samba Sow</a>, it is too early. Carl Jenkinson, as well.</p>
      <p>“They need a few days.</p>
      <p>“We will see for Saturday.”</p>

      <p>Lamouchi will, though, have Ryan Yates back from suspension, following a three-match ban for a red card at Bristol City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottingham-forest-bristol-city-verdict-3572317">The midfielder was sent off</a> for a two-footed challenge, but his manager says he has learnt from his mistake.</p>
      <p>“It is good to have him back. Ryan is important for the squad,” said Lamouchi.</p>
      <p>“He was an option before and he is an option for tomorrow, for sure.</p>
      <p>“I hope he has learnt, but I don’t have any problem with that because Ryan is a clever guy.</p>

      <p>“At the end of the day, we want the same things, so we need to learn about our mistakes.</p>
      <p>“It was a mistake, for sure. <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-boss-sabri-lamouchi-3571736">He knows that.</a></p>
      <p>“It is not only him.</p>
      <p>“The problem is if different players make the same mistake. It is not only Ryan who needs to learn, it is all the players in the squad.</p>
      <p>“Why? Because the small details, at the end, they are so important for us.”</p>
