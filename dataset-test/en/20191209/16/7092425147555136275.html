      <p>Speaking about her participation in the hit television show Mary said: “I’m really looking forward to it, I’m quite petrified but I’m looking forward to learning new dances and doing something different.</p>
      <p>"I’ve always been a fan and I’ve come out to watch the live show every year it’s been on so now it’s time to pony up and put my money where my mouth is...”</p>
      <p>With eight All Ireland titles to his name, Aidan Fogarty is used to taking home his share of silverware but this time his eyes are on a much more shinier prize, the glitter ball trophy!</p>

      <p>Speaking about joining the line-up Aidan said; “I feel really excited and really nervous. I’ve played in All-Ireland finals and I was coming up here today thinking I’d have taken an All-Ireland Final any day over this, but really excited and really nervous is probably the best way to describe how I’m feeling.”</p>

      <p>The couples will tackle a different dance genre each week from the Paso Doble to the Viennese waltz and will have just seven days to perfect their routine before performing it live to the nation.</p>
      <p>Also returning this year is the fabulous panel of judges: Brian Redmond, Loraine Barry and Julian Benson. They will cast their expert eyes over the dancers each week and judge them on their performances. Once again the celebrities and their dancers will be scored by both the judges and the viewing public at home.</p>
