      <p>Norris actor Malcolm Hebden suffered a heart attack in December 2017 and took leave from the show for over a year.</p>
      <p>While Malcolm recovered, his character was in Edinburgh visiting friend Emily and her niece Freda, who he soon got engaged to.</p>
      <p>He made a return in April of this year to sell No.3 and ask wife Mary to sign divorce papers.</p>
      <p>Norris made a brief return in October this year for Ken Barlow's 80th birthday.</p>
