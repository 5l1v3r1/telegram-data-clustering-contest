      <p>Bharat Bond Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the country's first corporate Bond ETF, will open for subscription from December 12-20. It is an exchange-traded mutual fund that will invest in bonds issued by public sector companies.</p>
      <p>The Bharat Bond ETF will have a base size of Rs 7,000 crore, with a green shoe option of additional Rs 8,000 crore. The unit value of the Bharat Bond will be capped at Rs 1,000, which will allow retail investors easy and low-cost access to bond markets. This will also increase participation of retail investors who are currently not participating in bond markets due to liquidity and accessibility constraints. Retail investors can invest with the minimum investment amount of Rs 1,000 and in multiples of Rs 1,000 thereafter, subject to maximum investment amount of Rs 2 lakhs only.</p>
