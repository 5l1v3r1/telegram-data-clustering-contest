      <p>Cricket - <b>Sri Lanka</b> have touched down in <b>Pakistan</b> for a tour that will see the home country hosting Test cricket for the first time since the 2009 terrorist attack.</p>
      <p>Eight people were killed and several players were wounded when the Sri Lanka team bus was shot at in Lahore in March 2009.</p>
      <p>The majority of Pakistan's home Test matches have since taken place in the United Arab Emirates in the intervening years.</p>
      <p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Wasim Khan said Sri Lanka's arrival marked an "historic occasion".</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka played three ODIs and three T20 matches in Pakistan in September and October, but their upcoming tour of Pakistan marks the return of Test cricket to the country, with the first Test starting in Rawalpindi starting on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The second and final game of the series will be played in Karachi from 19 December.</p>
      <p>"This is my first tour to Pakistan," said Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne.</p>
      <p>"After the 2009 incidents, players were scared to tour Pakistan but in the last two years or so Sri Lanka and other teams have toured Pakistan.</p>
      <p>"We want to play good cricket in Pakistan and hope they give us some good security."</p>
      <p>Khan added: "Pakistan's losses due to non-hosting of international cricket have been substantial.</p>
      <p>"Pakistan cricket supporters have been denied the opportunity to see their heroes play live in our national stadiums."</p>
