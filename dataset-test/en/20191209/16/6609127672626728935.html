      <p>And his sons, aged 33 and 36, had to be rescued from the water late on Saturday night after they reportedly “got into problems” during their search for him in a dinghy amid grim weather conditions.</p>
      <p>However, Police Scotland have confirmed that they will continue their search along the nearby coastline while HM Coastguard have stopped theirs.</p>
      <p>A cops statement read: "Officers in Greenock received reports from the Coastguard of an ongoing incident on the Firth of Clyde near Gourock around 12.10am on Sunday, December 8.</p>
      <p>"A 36-year-old man and a 33-year-old man were rescued from the water.</p>
      <p>"A 55-year-old man is still missing and the search is continuing."</p>
      <p>The two men were taken ashore and checked over by paramedics.</p>
      <p>Worried locals spotted a police helicopter scouring the area in the early hours of Sunday morning - and search boats were patrolling the river as they hunt for David.</p>
      <p>The hunt was called off just after 3am - but resumed on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>However, now, the coastguard have stood down their search for the 55-year-old.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: "Following a report of two boats in distress on Saturday in the Greenock Bay area,  HM Coastguard together with RNLI, Police Scotland and other local resources responded.</p>
      <p>"Two people were rescued but one remains unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>"Overnight and again on Sunday 8 December, resources continued to carry out an extensive search of both shorelines in the area up towards the Erskine Bridge but the missing man was not found.</p>
      <p>"The decision was taken to terminate the search, pending any further information. Our thoughts are with the family at this time."</p>
      <p>A worried pal told the Daily Record he would remain at the scene until David was found.</p>
      <p>He said: “We took his boat out of the water on Friday because it was going into the garage. He was in one of his dinghies when he went missing.</p>
      <p>“When he didn’t come back, his two sons went looking for him and they had to be rescued.</p>
      <p>“We’ve all got boats and David would come down here regularly and sit for hours looking out at the bay.</p>
      <p>“Something has obviously happened and it’s devastating. David’s a good pal to everybody.</p>
      <p>“I’m going nowhere until he’s been found.”</p>
      <p>An HM Coastguard spokesperson said yesterday: "A search has resumed this morning for a man who is still missing after two boats got into difficulty off Cardwell Bay, Gourock, in Scotland last night.</p>
      <p>"Greenock, Helensburgh and Kilgreggan Coastguard Rescue Team, along with Helensburgh RNLI lifeboat and the HM Coastguard helicopter from Prestwick were all sent to the scene.”</p>
      <p>Duty controller for HM Coastguard Ben Hambling said: "We received the call around 11.20 on Saturday evening which said two boats had got into difficulty in that area.</p>
      <p>"We have carried out an extensive search and two men have been rescued by the lifeboat.</p>
      <p>“The search for the other man continued until just after 3am today when the weather and darkness made it too difficult to continue.</p>
      <p>“The search is ongoing and we have no further information."</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said yesterday: “Officers in Greenock received reports from the Coastguard of an ongoing incident on the Firth of Clyde near Gourock around 12.10am on Sunday, 8 December, 2019.</p>
      <p>“A 36-year-old man and a 33-year-old man were rescued from the water.</p>
      <p>“A 55-year-old man is still missing. The search activity continues.”</p>
