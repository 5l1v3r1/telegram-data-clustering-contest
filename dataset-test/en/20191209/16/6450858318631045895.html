      <p>Wait, Gremlins is a Christmas movie? Hell yeah Gremlins is a Christmas movie. In fact, like Die Hard, Gremlins is the epitome of a great movie that is set at Christmas. It can be watched at any time, but the season of goodwill to all men is the best time to bathe in the malevolent humour and horror of this 1984 Hollywood classics. (See also '<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/best-christmas-movies-ever-3651954/">How to watch every Christmas movie online</a>'.)</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated Gremlins is the tale of a small town teen who gets the gift of a cute pet, which comes with three golden rules of ownership. Naturally, he quickly breaks those rules, unleashing a horrifying creature invasion on his home town. Chaos, humour and horror ensues.</p>
      <p>Gremlins is a classic because it blends horror with humour. It’s aged better than many of its contemporaries, too. So if you are in the mood for some Christmas-themed fun this festive season, you are going to want to watch Gremlins. Here we explain how to watch Gremlins online, on TV or on any mobile device.</p>
