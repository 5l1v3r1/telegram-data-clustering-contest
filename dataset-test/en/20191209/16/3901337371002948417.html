      <p>Below are four key tactical factors in the result.</p>

      <p>-          Makeshift defence concedes four set-pieces</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mabena Plays The Firmino Role</b>
      </p>
      <p>Celtic changed their attack for this game, leaving out target man, Motebang Sera and instead used Ndumiso Mabena as a false nine, with a speedy left footed right winger in Tebogo Potsane. This resembled the combination seen at Liverpool and made it difficult for Chiefs to mark Mabena tightly. With three defensively solid players in central midfield, Celtic started the game very impressively. The front three were released into space on the counter attack but several accurate long passes by Lantshene Phalane.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chiefs’ Back Three &amp; Wingbacks Struggle</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp started with a 3-5-2 structure, as he did against Stellenbosch FC last time out. This meant that Bernard Parker was used as a left wingback, but he was too easily beaten for the opening goal and had difficulties covering his inside throughout the first half. Mabena caused Erick Mathoho all sorts of problems by pulling him out of the backline, and Celtic’s left back, Sifiso Ngobeni did a good job in stopping Reeve Frosler by pushing high and not allowing many crosses. </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Middendorp Goes To Back Four</b>
      </p>
      <p>At half-time, Middendorp withdrew Parker and moved to a flat back four. This protected the left channel a lot better and Mathoho was not drawn out of the backline as often in the second period. To allow this change, Dumisani Zuma came on to play a narrow role on the left flank, whilst George Maluleka’s introduction after 54 minutes brought more penetration to Chiefs’ passing in midfield as they shifted to a narrow 4-4-2 formation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Makeshift Defence Concedes Four Set-Pieces</b>
      </p>
      <p>Of Amakhosi’s five goals scored, four came from set-play scenarios – three corners delivered into the box and one wide freekick. The delivery of Lebogang Manyama was superb as he notched three assists, but the key factor was Celtic missing three vastly experienced players in their back five – there was no Jackson Mabokgwane in goal (and Mondli Mpoto made one error leading to a goal), whilst Tshepo Rikhotso is nursing a shoulder problem and Wandisile Letlabika has been out injured long-term with a knee complaint. This meant that left back, Ronaldo Pfumbidzai was used in central defence. He struggled against Samir Nurkovic, who scored three goals and won nine of his ten duels in the match. Between them, Leonardo Castro and Nurkovic were fouled seven times in the match. </p>
