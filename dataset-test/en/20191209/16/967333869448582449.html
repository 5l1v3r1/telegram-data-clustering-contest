      <p>Washington outlet Voice of America (VoA) <a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/pentagon-concerned-russia-cultivating-sympathy-among-us-troops">has reported</a> the Pentagon is “concerned” by rising sympathy for Russia among US citizens, in particular those serving in the military.</p>
      <p>The second annual Reagan National Defense Survey, <a href="https://www.reaganfoundation.org/media/355273/reagan-institute-2019-defense-survey-release-final.pdf">issued November</a>, found 46 percent of armed services households said they viewed Russia as an ally, while 28 percent of average Americans did so, up from 19 percent in 2018.</p>
      <p>While 71 percent of Americans and 53 percent of military households still view Russia as an enemy, the spike in pro-Russian sentiment has “defense officials concerned” VoA report, and this anxiety “runs deep” as it’s not the only survey to produce such results. A survey of over 1,000 US adults by the Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/03/04/americans-and-germans-disagree-on-the-state-of-bilateral-relations-but-largely-align-on-key-international-issues/">issued September 2018</a> found 35 percent of US citizens wanted more cooperation with Russia.</p>
      <p>The outlet quotes a number of national security officials, who offer a variety of explanations for the inconvenient body of opinion – for instance, Defense Department spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Carla Gleason blamed the troubling stats on Russia “[flooding] the media with disinformation to sow doubt and confusion” and “false narratives designed to elicit sympathetic views”. Examples of this alleged phenomenon were unforthcoming.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Jorge Benitez, ‘nonresident senior fellow’ at NATO think tank the Atlantic Council attributed the rise – which he dubbed “dangerous” – to Donald Trump’s “positive statements” about the country and President Vladimir Putin, apparently unaware the leader’s <a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/trump-national-security-strategy-aims-regain-momentum">national defense strategy</a> clearly and specifically lists Russia along with China as the “prime threats” to the US.</p>
