      <h1>Coleen Rooney backs Deliveroo after 'misleading' advert ban</h1>
      <h2>Another advert by the delivery service, which aired in March, was also banned two months ago</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:21:27+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lottie-gibbons/" target="_blank">Lottie Gibbons</a></address>
      <p>Coleen Rooney has appeared <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/spent-afternoon-following-deliveroo-cyclists-17269121">to back a new Deliveroo advert</a> after one of the company's promotional videos was banned.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tv">The television advert</a> for the food service was banned <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/shopping">for misleading customers</a> after it became one of the most complained-about commercials of the year.</p>
      <p>Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the company was wrong to suggest deliveries could be made from multiple restaurants in a single package without incurring extra charges.</p>

      <p>The advert, which first aired in September 2019, showed a woman receiving an order, before diving into a single bag and distributing meals from various restaurants.</p>
      <p>As the woman called out the names of several food outlets, on-screen text stated "geographical restrictions apply" and "separate orders must be made for each restaurant".</p>
      <p>However, the company have since released a new advert which was shared by the WAG.</p>
      <p>The advert was launched as a tribute to hardworking midwives in UK hospitals.</p>

      <p>Deliveroo worked directly with midwife, Katy, to uncover the stresses, joys and emotions that are all part of the service of delivering babies which form the final advert.</p>
      <p>The film documents unsung hero on a normal working day. It starts with the alarm waking her at 4:30am, she then makes her way to the hospital where she is greeted by enthusiastic colleagues and nervous parents alike, never knowing where her shift might take her that day.</p>
      <p>Midwives are busier than ever and on Christmas day alone thousands of midwives are expected to welcome around 1,400 Christmas babies into the UK.</p>
      <p>Deliveroo has said they will set raise at least £100,000 for midwives which will be a combination of a donation from the company and fundraising from customers. The money will go to University College London Hospital.</p>
      <p>Coleen shared the advert on Twitter, writing: "Gotta love this campaign for midwives in lead up to Christmas. Where would be be without the amazing midwives?" </p>
      <p>Another advert by the delivery service, which aired in March, was also banned two months ago.</p>
      <p>A spokesman from the company said: "For the record, you can't actually dive into your Deliveroo bag, however hungry you are.</p>
      <p>"The advert is clearly fantastical in nature, including a woman diving into a Deliveroo bag."</p>
