      <h4>Frank Lampard has called Chelsea versus Lille a knockout round match come early. The Blues more or less need to win to make the next round.</h4>
      <p>Chelsea has control over their Champions League fate. Win against Lille and regardless of the other match, the Blues are through to the round of 16. Draw and Ajax will need to do Chelsea a favor by defeating Valencia. Lose and Chelsea is out because of Valencia’s superior head to head record against Chelsea. For better or worse, this is a knockout match in all but name. Frank Lampard’s side needs to put aside recent struggles and get the job done.</p>
      <h3>Kepa Arrizabalaga, 1, Goalkeeper, Spain</h3>
      <p>The match against Everton showed all that Arrizabalaga can and cannot do. He made a few good saves and smartly came out for a few crosses, but he was also at fault for at least one goal and his distribution is hopeful at best. It will be low on the priority list, but if Chelsea cannot bring in a coach to set Arrizabalaga right, then they need to look at a player to challenge him. Willy Caballero was only briefly that if ever and he is nowhere close to giving Arrizabalaga food for thought now.</p>
      <h3>Cesar Azpilicueta, 28, Right back, Spain</h3>
      <p>If Reece James had a few more years of experience, he would easily be Chelsea’s best full back. But as it stands, it is that lack of experience that holds him back. Technically and tactically he is excellent but he often makes naive mistakes thinking he knows what is going to happen. It is not enough to exile him to the bench, but on a must win day where Lille will look to counter, the wisest move may be putting Azpilicueta back on the right side.</p>
      <p>Kurt Zouma, 15, Center back, France</p>
      <p>Zouma has had a strange few weeks as he has gone from the right to the left. Lampard clearly trusts him as shown by the large amount of time he has played. But there is seemingly no reason or benefit to playing him on the left of defense. He looks even more awkward over there and the only constant is he plays there when Andreas Christensen plays and when Azpilicueta is on the left. Hopefully Lampard puts him back to a more comfortable right side.</p>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger, 2, Center back, Germany</p>
      <p>Fikayo Tomori is out injured and that has possibly been why he has been kept out as of late. Andreas Christensen has returned but he is looking increasingly overwhelmed by the game. That leaves Rudiger who has been going through a pretty intense regimen to return to not only physical fitness, but match fitness. Would it be a little crazy to throw him right into a game this big? Maybe, but the options are short and Lampard seems to trust the work that has been put in for Rudiger.</p>
      <h3>Emerson, 33, Left back, Italy</h3>
      <p>With Azpilicueta back on the right, obviously someone needs to line up on the left. Given that Marcos Alonso seems to have been fully exiled and earmarked for a transfer, Emerson is really the only choice. It would be a risk given Lille’s love for a counter attack and Emerson’s distaste for dropping into a defensive position, but it is what it is. Emerson will need to turn up in a big way if he is to start finding minutes once again.</p>
