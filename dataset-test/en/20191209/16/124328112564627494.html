      <p>A group of cowboy hat-wearing pigeons have been spotted in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/las-vegas/index.html"><b>Las Vegas</b></a> leading to concerns that someone may be gluing the accessories onto the birds.</p>
      <p>Footage of the stetson wearing pigeons has gone viral after it was shared by local Bobby Lee with the caption 'just another day in the neighborhood'.</p>
      <p>The birds don't seem to be phased by the headgear as they busily peck the ground in the empty parking lot.</p>
      <p>However the hats, each slightly tilted, do not move as the pigeons peck around, suggesting they are glued on. </p>

      <p>In the background a bemused Mr Lee, who is filming from his car, can be heard saying: 'These birds have hats on bro. </p>
      <p>'The s*** you see in my neighborhood.' </p>
      <p>The video was filmed on Thursday in Parkway Villas 'across from 7/11' in Las Vegas and posted to Facebook by Mr Lee.</p>
      <p>While some viewers found the footage hilarious others were more concerned for the welfare of the birds. </p>

      <p>Elisabeth Dufault Forte commented: 'Hilarious! The hats aren’t even bothering them!' </p>
      <p>However, Mariah Rea, who owns pigeon rescue centre Lofty Hopes, wrote: 'This is sad. Someone did this. However these are staying on is cruelty.</p>
      <p>'If it's glue that's horrible. If it's tied on it will be tangle around their necks</p>
      <p>'I'm trying to get a hold of the guy who posted this so we can attempt to trap them and get the hats off. '</p>
