      <p>Midfielder Kalvin Phillips will return to the Leeds side for the Sky Bet Championship clash with Hull at Elland Road on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Phillips missed Saturday’s 2-0 win at Huddersfield as he served a one-match suspension for collecting five yellow cards this season.</p>
      <p>Boss Marcelo Bielsa has confirmed skipper Liam Cooper will be sidelined for a second successive match with a calf strain.</p>
      <p>Cooper joins midfielders Jamie Shackleton (muscular), Adam Forshaw (hip) and Tyler Roberts (hamstring) in the treatment room.</p>
      <p>Hull head coach Grant McCann may opt for an unchanged line-up following a strong showing from his side in Saturday’s 2-1 home win over Stoke.</p>
      <p>It is understood McCann has no fresh injury concerns from the match, nor are any players due back from the treatment room in time for the trip across Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Although striker Josh Magennis’ hamstring injury was not as serious as first thought, he is not due back until after this weekend at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Fellow striker Norbert Balogh is working his way back from a calf injury, while midfielders Jon Toral (knee) and Kevin Stewart (foot) are long-term absentees.</p>
