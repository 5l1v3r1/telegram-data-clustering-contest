      <p>While tooth loss is declining, a third of Australian adults have untreated tooth decay and an increasing number are avoiding treatment because of the cost, a new study has found.</p>
      <p>The University of Adelaide has compiled the first national oral health study in 10 years based on data from 15,000 Australians across each state and territory.</p>
      <p>Professor David Brennan, the director of the Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health , says the study has also found the prevalence of gum disease is increasing along with levels of toothache.</p>
      <p>"Almost one-quarter of adults rated their oral health as fair or poor, and one in five adults experienced toothache," Prof Brennan said.</p>
      <p>The study found the use of dental services was declining with 40 per cent of adults avoiding or delaying care due to cost.</p>
