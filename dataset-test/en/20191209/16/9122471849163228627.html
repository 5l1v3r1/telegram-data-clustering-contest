      <h1>LSU QB Joe Burrow Reveals What Nebraska Told Him</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:24:28+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>We will likely find out at the end of the week that LSU quarterback Joe Burrow is the 2019 Heisman Trophy winner. The former Ohio State quarterback has come a long way since his backup days with the Buckeyes, and reflected on his journey by pointing out one program that doubted him as a prospect.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with ESPN’s Tom Rinaldi, Burrow revealed that he initially wanted to go to Nebraska.</p>
      <p>Burrow’s father, Jimmy Burrow, was a defensive back for the Huskers in the 1970s. Jimmy ultimately parlayed his success on the field into an NFL draft pick and a very successful career in the CFL.</p>
      <p>But the Huskers were one of many teams that wouldn’t even give Burrow a scholarship offer – at least not right away, according to Burrow. So he ultimately went with Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://saturdaytradition.com/nebraska-football/joe-burrow-really-wanted-to-play-qb-at-nebraska-they-told-me-i-wasnt-good-enough/">Saturday Tradition</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I wanted to go to Nebraska but they told me I wasn’t good enough,” Burrow said in an interview.</blockquote>
      <p>Burrow ultimately got the last laugh as a backup at Ohio State. He went 7-of-9 for 66 yards in spot duty in wins over the Huskers in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>As for Nebraska, they continued going with Tommy Armstrong in 2015 and 2016, Tanner Lee in 2017, and have now hitched their wagon to Adrian Martinez.</p>
      <p>If Burrow is in any way bitter over being snubbed by Nebraska, he’ll have at least one more game to rub it in their faces.</p>
