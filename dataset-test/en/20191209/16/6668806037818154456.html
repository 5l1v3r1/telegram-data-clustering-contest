      <p>Ashutosh Gowarikar's Panipat starring Arjun Kapoor and Kriti Sanon is facing some trouble after its release. Reportedly, the audience in Rajasthan is terribly upset with this historical drama and the portrayal of their ruler in the film.</p>
      <p>The matter has escalated so much that the descendants of the ruler, Maharaja Surajmal have even appealed for a ban of the movie. According to reports, the portrayal of Maharaja Surajmal, as a greedy ruler, who asked for the Agra Fort in return of his support to Sadashivrao Bhau who sought his help against the Afghans has offended the family.</p>

      <p>Given this situation, Vishvendra Singh who is said to be the 14th generation of the ruler, released a statement saying, "It is very sad that a great man like Maharaja Surajmal Jat of Bharatpur has been depicted in the film Panipat in a very wrong way, while tampering with historical facts. I believe that the film should be banned in view of the huge opposition by the Jat community of Haryana, Rajasthan and North India. Otherwise, the law and order of the country may deteriorate. I request the government to make a committee to ensure that if a film is made on a dynasty or a great person, permission should be obtained from the family before its release."</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the film is facing a huge outrage on social media as #BoycottPanipat is trending on Twitter. Actor Randeep Hooda, who belongs to the Jatt community also slammed the makers indirectly in a tweet, also giving a piece of advice to the members who got offended. He wrote, "To glorify one community, one doesn’t need to show others down… it mostly has an adverse effect .. hoping for a more mature understanding in the future. To the offended - it’s just a movie, don’t attach your ancestors’ legacy to a piece of pure entertainment #MaharajaSurajmal"</p>
