      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Former <i>Bachelorette</i> contestant J.P. Rosenbaum has been diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder.</p>
      <p>Rosenbaum, 42, and his wife, <i>Bachelorette</i> Season 7 star Ashley Hebert, shared Rosenbaum's diagnosis with Guillain-Barré syndrome Sunday on Instagram Stories.</p>
      <p>Rosenbaum posted photos and videos from a hospital, where he is undergoing immunoglobulin therapy. He described Guillain-Barré syndrome as "a very surreal, and humbling, and crazy, rare" disorder.</p>
      <p>"Just can't really believe it," Rosenbaum said. "Next steps are figure out if I've plateaued, which I think I have, in my symptoms. Definitely staying another night in the hospital."</p>
      <p>Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes a person's own immune system to damage the nerves, according <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/guillain-barre.html">to the CDC</a>. The disorder can cause muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.</p>
      <p>Hebert also shared photos and videos with Rosenbaum from the hospital.</p>
      <p>"Jp was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome yesterday. He is in treatment and doing well," Hebert wrote. "It may be a long road to full recovery, but we are so grateful to everyone that has helped us get to a speedy diagnosis and treatment."</p>
