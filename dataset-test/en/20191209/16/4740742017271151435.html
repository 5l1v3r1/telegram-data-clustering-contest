      <h2>'It had been nine hours since she was playing Lego cards with me'</h2>

      <p>The mum of a teen who died after an MRI scan has spoken of the moment she was told her daughter couldn't be saved - just hours after they played Lego cards together.</p>
      <p>Alice Sloman died on October 19 last year after a three-day battle, an inquest heard today (Monday, December 9).</p>
      <p>The 14-year-old had visited Torbay Hospital in Devon with her mum and grandmother on October 16 for the examination to be carried out under general anaesthetic.</p>
      <p>But it soon became clear something was wrong during the procedure so Alice was rushed to Bristol Children's Hospital for critical care.</p>

      <p>Despite the efforts of staff there she died.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at her inquest, Alice's mum Sarah relived the moment she was told her daughter was going to die.</p>
      <p>She said: "As soon as we got there [to Bristol] they assessed her.</p>
      <p>"They took us in a room and told us there's nothing they can do for her - she's going to die. We said we didn't have time to digest this.</p>
      <p>"It had been nine hours since she was playing Lego cards with me - then you get told she's going to die.</p>
      <p>"I asked them please, just try something to bring her back."</p>
      <p>The inquest heard that staff at Bristol Children's Hospital tried in vain to save the teenager.</p>
      <p>She suffered several problems over the three-day period including renal failure, high blood pressure and a fluctuating heart rate.</p>
      <p>She was put on life support but eventually died at around 2pm on October 19 after suffering a pulmonary hemmorghage hours before.</p>
      <p>The medical cause of death is yet to be determined by the coroner, Dr Simon Fox, QC.</p>

      <p>Giving evidence in a statement, Dr Margrid Schindler from Bristol Children's Hospital said: "It was explained to the parents that Alice was very unlikely to survive.</p>
      <p>"They then agreed that the didn't want her to suffer anymore so she received care to make her comfortable."</p>
      <p>The hearing was told Alice, who had a mental age of a five or six year old, suffered from several issues for much of her life including autism, hypermobility, visual impairment and growth.</p>
      <p>She took hormones for the latter for several years although had stopped prior to visiting Torbay Hospital on that fateful day.</p>
      <p>Alice, from Torquay, Devon, had been admitted for the MRI after complaining of headaches.</p>
      <p>Mum Sarah revealed she was "terrified" after first hearing this - because she didn't want her daughter to find out information that could hurt her.</p>
      <p>She said: "My concern was, why are you doing an MRI?</p>
      <p>"I said she's getting these headaches - I don't want her to hear she's getting a tumour. I was worried it might show something in her brain - I was terrified."</p>

      <p>But she added she wasn't concerned about her daughter having an MRI or going under anaesthetic generally as she had had one several years earlier - with no problems.</p>
      <p>Alice eventually visited Torbay Hospital and was highly anxious ahead of the procedure.</p>
      <p>The hearing was told she showed both high blood pressure and a high heart rate when tested, although this was attributed to her nerves.</p>
      <p>There was also a change in the amount of general anaesthetic she was administered after it was decided the initial dose would be too high.</p>
      <p>She was then wheeled down to the MRI room with her mum on the trolley before Sarah left to find some food.</p>
      <p>But when she came back it was clear something was wrong.</p>
      <p>She said: "There were alarms going off behind the closed doors.</p>
      <p>"The first thing was that they thought she had had an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic.</p>
      <h3>'We were allowed to give her a kiss'</h3>
      <p>"We were allowed to see her in the MRI quickly - she was surrounded by I don't know how many people.</p>
      <p>"We were allowed to give her a kiss while they carried on doing what they were doing to her."</p>
      <p>The transfer team then arrived before Alice was taken to Bristol later than evening - where she later died.</p>
      <p>While giving evidence, mum Sarah questioned whether her daughter's heart could have been enlarged by the growth hormone.</p>
      <p>She said: "If it raises your weight and height what else is it growing?</p>
      <p>"How can you give growth hormone to a child then not check everything else is growing? How can you stick it in a particular part of the body?</p>
      <p>The inquest at Avon Coroner's Court continues.</p>
