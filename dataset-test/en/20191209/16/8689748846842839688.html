      <p>Speaking in a recent interview on Peace FM, Kuborlor disclosed how he almost fainted while he accidentally sat on his balls when he was riding a bicycle up a hill.</p>
      <p>Despite this painful experience, Kuborlor stated emphatically that there is no way he is wearing underwear since the benefits exceeds the disadvantages.</p>
      <p>” As for wearing underwear/ dross, there is no way I will change and wear it. I have sat on my balls twice but I won’t wear it. There was one time I almost fainted and fell in a gutter while I accidentally sat on my balls. I was riding up the hill on a bicycle but I miscalculated my steps and it happened….. It was extremely painful but that won’t deter me from going pantless.” He explained.</p>
      <p>Born to an Akan father and a Romanian mother, Kuborlor is known for his unique style of doing music. He and his sister, Deborah Vanessa are both making it big in the entertainment industry.</p>
      <p>To those who thought Kuborlor will change from going pantless, well the bad news is that he is not changing anytime soon.</p>
