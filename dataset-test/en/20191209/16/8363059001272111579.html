      <h1>Spotify Says It Still Has No Plans for Nintendo Switch Support and It Wouldn't Tell You if It Did</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:20:24+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Two years after a forum thread on having Spotify support on the Nintendo Switch, the music streaming app <i>still</i> isn't on there.</p>
      <p>And it won't be, so stop asking. And if it ever is, you're going to be the last to know about it, so pipe the fuck down. That's the takeaway from the update on that forum post at least, that went up last week.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Partnership-Spotify-for-Nintendo-Switch/idi-p/1647181">initial post</a> from an eager Spotendo fanboy reads:</p>
      <blockquote>"I know the hardware is relatively new, but I STRONGLY feel it could benefit both Spotify and Nintendo if an app was produced for the Nintendo Switch."</blockquote>
      <p>Even in the face of all caps, Spotify has unequivocally said that it won't be coming to the console - that has since had a second iteration as a dedicated handheld with the Switch Lite - and that it's not something they'd be telling any Tom, Dick, or Harry about anyway. Spotify's recent update reads:</p>
      <blockquote>"Hey folks, Spotify staff here.<br/><br/>We’re always working on improving the Spotify experience across platforms, but we don’t have any further information to share at the moment.<br/>It should also be noted that we typically don't announce integrations with third parties in advance.<br/><br/>Thanks for continuing to share your ideas."</blockquote>
      <p>For some reason, people can't quite seem to accept the idea of a device that's not <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/06/retail-leak-claims-netflix-and-youtube-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">bloated with every single app you could possibly think of</a>, and as a result, the Switch finds itself at the centre of conversations about which media apps will be made available on the platform, and a lot of <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/11/youtube-finally-lands-on-nintendo-switch/">pissing and moaning about the ones that aren't</a>.</p>
      <p>You've got a dozen devices that all of these apps are available on. The Switch is a perfectly fine console, and the tablets and smartphones you have are likely better suited for streaming than the console is. <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/06/the-nintendo-switch-doesnt-need-netflix-or-any-other-streaming-app/">Nintendo's Switch doesn't need streaming apps</a>, so stop your whinging.
