        <b>INSURGENTS believed to be members of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), released a video showing the execution of two Nigerian soldiers and a policeman according to a <a href="https://www.channelstv.com/2019/12/09/just-in-iswap-kills-two-soldiers-policeman-threatens-army-in-new-video/">report</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The security personnel who were killed were reportedly abducted at a fake checkpoint in Benisheikh, a village located 70 kilometres west of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.</p>
      <p>The video revealed that three security personnel were severely tortured with their hands tied behind them.</p>
      <p>In the video, the captives displayed their identity cards and introduced themselves one after another, as a mobile police sergeant, a sergeant in the Nigerian Army and a private soldier.</p>
      <p>Before their execution, a masked man who spoke in Hausa with his back to a river believed to be around the Lake Chad, threatened that the group would carry out ‘massive attacks’ on military formations and ambushes on the highways in the region.</p>

      <p>“We are saying to the soldiers of Nigeria, we will never spare those fighting people practising the religion of Allah. Because of that, we shall attack your barracks, wallahi (truely)  we shall block you on your roads. The story is, what you hear is not what you see; what lies ahead is tougher and uglier than this, Allahu Akbar,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian Army had announced “Operation Positive Identification” in November a move that would help in identifying and arresting fleeing Boko Haram terrorists in any part of the country.</p>
      <p>However, insurgent attacks have reduced generally since late October which the military attributed to its new ‘super camp’ strategy that made it difficult for terrorists to overrun brigades and battalions.</p>
      <p>The police and army authorities have not officially confirmed the identities of the executed security personnel.</p>
      <p>The Army spokesperson, Sagir Ahmed was not immediately available to respond to enquiries when contacted by <b>The ICIR.</b></p>
      <p>Calls put across to his mobile phone were not answered.  A text message sent to him was also not respond to as at the time of filing this report.</p>
