      <p>Veteran opener Wasim Jaffer on Monday became the first player in Indian cricket to feature in 150 Ranji matches. The 41-year-old from Maharashtra, who has been an important part of the title-winning Vidarbha team in the last two years, achieved the rare distinction during their Group A opener against Andhra Pradesh in Vijayawada.</p>
      <p>The former India opener is now just 853 runs away from completing 20,000 runs in first-class cricket.</p>
      <p>Jaffer is followed by Madhya Pradesh batsman Devendra Bundela (145 matches) and Amol Muzumdar (136 matches), who have played for Mumbai and Assam.</p>
