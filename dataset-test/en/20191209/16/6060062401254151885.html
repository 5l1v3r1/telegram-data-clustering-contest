      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:48:42+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/joe-ciolli" target="_blank">Joe Ciolli</a></address>
      <p>Dear Readers,</p>
      <p>No one wants to hear they're saving for retirement all wrong. But maybe when that wisdom is being doled out by a Nobel Prize winner, it's time to listen.</p>
      <p>Economist Richard Thaler received the top honor in 2017, and recently sat down with Pimco CEO Emmanuel Roman to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retirement-savings-advice-annuities-richard-thaler-nobel-winning-pimco-economist-2019-12">dispel some widely held myths</a> around retirement.</p>
      <p>In short, Thaler thinks annuities and defined-benefit retirement plans are declining in popularity precisely at a time when they should be a professional's top choice. Here's his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retirement-savings-advice-annuities-richard-thaler-nobel-winning-pimco-economist-2019-12">full argument</a> in favor of them.</p>
      <p>Speaking of sage advice, the Investing team at Business Insider also covered some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investing-advice-tips-neal-bawa-data-driven-mogul-2019-12">recent tips</a> provided by Neal Bawa, the CEO of Grocapitus and MultifamilyU. He's a real-estate mogul who owns more than 1,000 units, and he relies heavily on a data-driven approach that helps him make the right decision "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investing-advice-tips-neal-bawa-data-driven-mogul-2019-12">90-plus percent of the time</a>."</p>
      <p>He uses population growth, income growth, home-pricing growth, job growth, and crime reduction as criteria in his strategy. Read about his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investing-advice-tips-neal-bawa-data-driven-mogul-2019-12">full methodology here</a>.</p>
      <p>Going beyond that, here's a rundown of our other main coverage from the last week. It includes a look at how to set up your family for generations of financial security, the unveiling of five stock picks from a tech-investing heavyweight, and how one top-ranked money manager is feasting on downtrodden unicorns.</p>

        <b>A leading money manager explains how 70% of a family's wealth is burned by the 3rd generation — and shares the 10 questions you should ask yourself to avoid that fate</b>
      </p>
      <p>John Parise, managing partner and founder of Copper Beech Financial Group, says that bickering and communication issues between family members leads to a 70% reduction in a family's wealth over three generations.</p>
