      <h1>Awkward moment Miss Universe host names wrong winner 4 years after last blunder</h1>
      <h2>Miss Universe host Steve Harvey was left red-faced yet again as Miss Malaysia Shweta Sekhon corrected him when he wrongly named the winner of the national costume category</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:59:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Ye</a></address>
      <p>This year's Miss Universe pageant was tainted by another embarrassing blunder as host Steve Marvey again named the wrong winner - this time for the national costume category.</p>
      <p>Hosting the show at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta on Sunday night, he announced Miss Philippines as winner for best national costume when it was in fact Miss Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Determined to set things right, Malaysia's Shweta Sekhon - who was stood next to Harvey - grabbed the mic and corrected the 62-year-old host.</p>
      <p>"It's not Philippines, it's Malaysia," she said.</p>
      <p>Harvey quickly blamed the teleprompter, saying: "Let me explain something to you. I just read that in the teleprompter.</p>

      <p>"Ya'll got to quit doing this to me. I can read. Now, they are trying to fix it now. See? This is what they did to me back in 2015, played me short like that.</p>
      <p>"That's crazy."</p>
      <p>Miss Malaysia's costume was colourful and adorned with food while Miss Philippine's costume appeared to be grey in colour.</p>
      <p>The awkward moment drew attention away from the winner of the 2019 pageant Zozibini Tunza, Miss South Africa.</p>

      <p>Tunza said: "I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me — with my kind of skin and my kind of hair — was never considered to be beautiful.</p>
      <p>"I think it is time that that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face and I want them to see their faces reflected in mine."</p>

      <p>Harvey made a similar blunder in 2015, when he wrongly named Miss Colombia the winner of the pageant when it was actually Miss Philippines.</p>
      <p>At the time, Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutierrez wiped away tears of joy and waved to her fans as the crown was placed on her head.</p>
      <p>But the crown was taken away minutes later on live television and placed on Miss Philippines Pia Alonzo Wurtsbach's head.</p>
