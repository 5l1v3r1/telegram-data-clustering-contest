      <p>Supermodel Bella Hadid has put on an eye-popping display after she was recently spotted on a beach in St. Bart’s walking braless in a transparent top. The 23-year-old posed for an impromptu photoshoot against a palm tree and later posted one of the pictures on her Instagram. “Hellz Bellz” frames in light pink and silver from all z angles”, Hadid wrote in the post, referring to her Chrome Hearts sunglasses.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month the supermodel posted a video from her recent photoshoot for Chrome Hearts, showing Hadid in a very revealing outfit. At some point in the video Hadid <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5ia4oigpX9/">appeared half-naked covering her bust with her hands</a>.</p>
      <p>In October, she was proclaimed the most beautiful woman in the world according to a mathematical equation that calculates the perfect face. It was used by artists in ancient Greece and has been adopted by plastic surgeons today. Hadid’s face has a 94.35 percent accuracy making her the most beautiful woman in the world. Second place was scooped up by singer Beyonce, while Hollywood actress Amber Heard came third.</p>
