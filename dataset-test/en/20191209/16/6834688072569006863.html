      <p><a href="https://cowboy.com/">Cowboy</a>, a Belgium-based smart electric bike startup, has announced plans to launch an equity crowdfunding campaign on Crowdcube later this week. The funding round comes just after Cowboy secured 1 million investment from Index Ventures.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2017, Cowboy’s main mission is to improve “urban mobility” and take commuters to their destination in a more sustainable and efficient manner.</p>
      <blockquote>“Cowboy’s vision is to elevate the daily commute to the next level in terms of speed, comfort and freedom of movement around the city. Cowboy enhances the riding experience by unifying intelligent technology, delightful design and meticulous customer service.”</blockquote>
      <p>Cowboy reported that its to-date achievements include selling over 5,000 bikes in 2019 alone, five times year on year growth, 3,482,713 km ridden and 435,375 kgs saved in carbon emissions. While sharing details about the company’s growth, Adrien Roose, Cowboy CEO, stated:</p>
      <blockquote>“The growth of Cowboy over the past two years has demonstrated there is a real appetite amongst our customers to not only have a connected e-bike but to be a part of our micromobilty revolution as we look to reduce the amount of cars on the streets and decrease commute times. The last two years has shown us the passion that our community has and how they want to be a part of our future. Enabling them to become shareholders will be very powerful for us as we set our sights on transforming urban mobility.”</blockquote>
      <p>Luke Lang, co-founder and CMO, Crowdcube, also commented:</p>
      <blockquote>“Cowboy’s ambitious mission paints an inspiring future of smart cycling, eco travel and stunning design.  It also signals Crowdcube’s growth as later-stage entrepreneurs choose to increasingly raise finance with us by using the tools available to fire up their communities to champion a vision.”</blockquote>
      <p>Martin Mignot, Partner, Index Ventures, then noted:</p>
      <blockquote>“In less than two years Cowboy has grown from a little startup launching its first bike to a respected e-bike brand. I am passionate about Cowboy’s continued success as I truly believe that e-bikes will play a key role in helping transform some of the major issues cities face when it comes to congestion, noise and pollution.”</blockquote>
      <p>Cowboy went on to add that the funds raised through the funding round will aid its “ambitions to transform urban movement” across Europe as its aims to get more commuters traveling by electric bikes. The Crowdcube round is set to go live on December 12th. </p>
