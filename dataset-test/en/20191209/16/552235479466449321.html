      <h1>Alfredo Morelos receives Rangers vote of confidence as Scott Arfield lifts lid on striker's state of mind</h1>
      <h2>The striker endured a difficult afternoon as Celtic stunned their city rivals in the Betfred Cup Final.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T16:09:04+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Scott Arfield insists <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> will need no consoling from his Rangers team-mates following his Hampden nightmare.</p>
      <p>The striker spurned a host of chances as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> edged a dramatic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup Final</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Those misses included a penalty saved by Fraser Forster to ensure Morelos' search for a goal against the Hoops goes on.</p>
      <p>But Arfield believes the Colombian's strength of character will ensure he recovers quickly.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11788/11882394/scott-arfield-rangers-forward-alfredo-morelos-will-bounce-back-from-cup-final">Sky Sports</a>: "Not at all. He has dug us out of so many holes this season, he is a fantastic football player and a great character.</p>
      <p>"It's one of those things, everybody misses penalties and it is what it is.</p>
      <p>"We are fully behind him but I don't think he needs that.</p>

      <p>"He is a character that knows what he's all about, we know what he's all about, the fans know what he's all about.</p>
      <p>"He will bounce back for sure."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> can ill-afford to dwell on their disappointment as a decisive Europa League clash against Young Boys awaits on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox side require only a point to ensure they qualify for the last 32 before facing third-placed Motherwell in the Premiership.</p>
      <p>Arfield believes they deserved more from the Cup Final but is confident the defeat won't derail their campaign.</p>
      <p>He added: "It's really hard to take, I think we deserved a lot more from the game</p>
      <p>"With the magnitude of the game we are bitterly disappointed.</p>

      <p>"In the duration I have been here that's the most comfortable we have played (against Celtic). When you dissect it and analyse it I think there will be loads of positives, but at this minute it's hard to take.</p>
      <p>"We will reflect on it in a couple of days and see where we go.</p>
      <p>"It should have been our day because we deserved to win the trophy but the fact is we didn't, so we move on as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>"When we have got a manager like we have, we reflect, talk about it and move on quickly. At this football club we need to do that as quickly as possible because we have another huge game on Thursday, another huge game on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"We are under no illusions as to how tough the schedule is, so this is just a setback. We reflect and move on."</p>
