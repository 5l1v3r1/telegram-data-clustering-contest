      <h1>Gabe Nandez Reconnects with Ibekelia for New "Scroll" Visual</h1>
      <h2>The final video in support of his debut album.</h2>

      <p>Towards the end of May, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/gabe-nandez">Gabe Nandez</a> delivered a vignette for <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/gabe-nandez-escondido-music-video-stream">“Escondido,”</a> a record from his debut studio album <i>Diplomacy</i>. Now, the POW Recordings artist is back with the final video in support of <i>Diplomacy</i>, choosing to give album highlight “Scroll” the visual treatment. Notably, today’s clip for “Scroll” was put together by director David Findlay and filmed in New York City.</p>
      <p>“‘Scroll’ features my close friend and collaborator, Ibekelia; a Gabonese national who grew up in different countries like I did. The beat, produced by Tony Seltzer &amp; I, samples a Kora, an ancient harp indigenous to West Africa and traditionally played by the Griot,” Gabe Nandez shares with us, breaking down his latest release. “The song is a celebration of our roots and an ode to our ancestors. It’s an encapsulation of our triumph over past hardships and our determination to persevere. The video, directed by David Findlay and shot in New York City, is the final visual off of <i>Diplomacy</i>. My follow up project is straight fire and I’m looking forward to releasing it in 2020.”</p>
      <p>“My life served as the main inspiration for this album, which marks a monumental growth in me as a person,” Gabe Nandez previously explained when opening up about his debut LP. “<i>Diplomacy</i> is a concept I’ve had in mind for years now. The title is inspired by my father’s line of work as a diplomat for the United Nations, and the different countries my family and I ended up living in due to this path. I thematically re-interpret my nomadic upbringing on this record, and draw from my South American and West African roots as well.”</p>
