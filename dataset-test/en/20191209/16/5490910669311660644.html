      <h1>The Attico Unveils Eco-Friendly Holiday Capsule</h1>
      <h2>The Eighties-themed lineup includes six upcycled vintage furs, bejeweled pumps and a lipstick available on Dec. 10.</h2>

      <p><b>COOL AND GREEN:</b> The Attico girl is a confident type indulging in the luxury of precious items — but she wants to be eco-friendly, too.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2016 by Giorgia Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio, the Italian women’s wear label is launching on Dec. 10 a holiday <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/capsule-collection/">capsule collection</a> exclusively available on the brand’s e-commerce platform comprising a range of items with sustainable features.</p>
      <p>Nodding to the Eighties aesthetic that has become a brand’s signature, the lineup named “Call Me Back” includes six vintage <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/fur/">fur</a> coats crafted from mink, fox and martens that were reworked for a more contemporary silhouette, their linings and buttons overhauled. There are also three pairs of bejeweled stiletto pumps that were covered in pink, red and black Swarovski crystals’ leftovers.</p>

      <p>To complement the offering, Tordini and Ambrosio teamed with eco-chic makeup line La Bouche Rouge, creating a matte cherry pink-hued lipstick contained in a plastic-free case made of vegan leather.</p>
      <p>Marking the launch of the <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/prada-revamps-web-site-introduces-time-capsule-project-1203373042/">capsule collection</a>, The Attico is releasing images nodding to vintage analog shots and a video infused with a film noir undercurrent. The short movie follows model Jazzmine Berger’s journey as she strolls in the red-carpeted corridor of a hotel, while she selects The Velvet Underground’s “Venus in Furs” song from a jukebox and until she is picked up by a vintage car.</p>
      <p>The holiday capsule marks The Attico’s second sustainable effort. Last May California-based denim brand Re/Done tapped the designers and Instagram personalities to curate a capsule collection of upcycled floral dresses and cargo pants.</p>

      <p>Last year, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/ruffini-partecipazioni-invests-in-attico-sources-say-1202871560/">The Attico received an investment from Remo Ruffini</a>, who acquired a 49 percent stake in the company through a vehicle called Archive Srl, controlled by Ruffini Partecipazioni Holding.</p>
