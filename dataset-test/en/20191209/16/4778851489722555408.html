        <b>Boris Johnson has said he is "looking at" abolishing the BBC licence fee.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said while the Tories were currently "not planning to get rid of all TV licence fees", the current system "bears reflection".</p>

      <p>After being asked whether he would abolish TV licences altogether, Mr Johnson replied: "Well, I don't think at this late stage in the campaign I'm going to make an unfunded spending commitment like that, but what I certainly think is that the BBC should cough up and pay for the licences for the over-75s as they promised to do.</p>
      <p>"But at this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licence fees, though I am certainly looking at it."</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson said the question of whether the funding format for public service broadcasters "still makes sense" needs to be asked.</p>

      <p>He said: "But you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV, a media organisation still makes sense in the long term given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves - that's all I will say.</p>
      <p>"I think that the system of funding by what is effectively a general tax, isn't it, everybody has a TV, it bears reflection - let me put it that way.</p>
      <p>"How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels - that is the question."</p>

      <p>In their manifesto, the Conservatives said they "recognise the value of free TV licences for over-75s and believe they should be funded by the BBC".</p>
      <p>They have also pledged to "keep other pensioner benefits" which ensure older people have the security and dignity they deserve.</p>
      <p>Labour have promised to keep free TV licences for over-75s if they win power in the coming election.</p>

      <p>Both the BBC and the Government have been criticised over the announcement in June that free licences to all people aged over 75 were being scrapped.</p>
      <p>In response to Mr Johnson's comments, shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary Tom Watson said: "This is a pathetic attempt by Boris Johnson to distract from his refusal to even look at the picture of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on a hospital floor.</p>
      <p>"We already know that Boris Johnson is a danger to our NHS.</p>
      <p>"His comments today reveal that he will threaten the very existence of another of Britain's great institutions, the BBC, by scrapping its funding mechanism.</p>
      <p>"This is on top of the cruel decision to strip over-75s of their free TV licences.</p>
      <p>"An extreme Johnson government will damage everything that is good about this country. The only way to stop that is to vote Labour on Thursday."</p>
