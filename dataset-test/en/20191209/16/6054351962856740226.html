Joyner Lucas was among those adding his take on the tragic situation, placing the blame on rappers who glorify the use of drugs in their music.</p>
      <p>“Juice WRLD was 21,” Lucas wrote. “He was a product of our generation of rappers who glorified drugs and made it cool. Im blaming Yal niggaz for this shit. All that lean and pills niggaz glorify and talk about. You teaching the kids to do it. Smh you happy now?Rip @JuiceWorlddd. Gone too soon.”</p>

      <p>A fan pushed back at Lucas’ critique by claiming he didn’t know much about the late artist. Lucas responded by saying he didn’t mean the deceased rapper glorified drug use but asserted Juice was depressed and used them to cope.</p>
      <p>“I never said juice world glorified them,” he noted. “I knew what juice spoke about. Poor kid was depressed and went thru a lot so he used drugs as a outlet. Its this generation of music that glorified drugs and made them cool so kids like him and other kids abuse them. It’s a cycle dude. Smh.”</p>
