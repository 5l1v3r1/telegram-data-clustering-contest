      <p>In October, Thor <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/10/20/20919531/wanderlei-silva-son-thor-amateur-muay-thai-debut-brazil">told</a> MMA Fighting’s Guilherme Cruz that the plan wasn’t always to compete, but eventually he realized it made sense to take a fight given that he’s been training in training in jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and Muay Thai since childhood.</p>
      <p>“I’m always training, and then one day I thought to myself, ‘Why am I training? Oh, I want to fight, I want to be like my father,’” Silva said. “My dad inspired me to fight.”</p>
      <p>Thor is trained by Wanderlei’s longtime coach Andre Dida and has expressed an interest in trying his hand at MMA in the future.</p>
