      <h1>Quarter of world's arms sales from European companies: SIPRI</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:41:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Alice Tidey</a></address>
      <p>European companies accounted for nearly a quarter of arms sales from the world's Top 100 weapons manufacturers in 2018, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).</p>
      <p>In total, 27 companies based in Europe figured in <a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2019/global-arms-industry-rankings-sales-46-cent-worldwide-and-us-companies-dominate-top-5">SIPRI's ranking of the largest 100</a> arms and military services companies which excludes Chinese firms due to a lack of transparent and reliable data. They raked in a combined 102 billion (€92,09 billion)</p>
      <p>Despite a 4.8% fall in sales, Britain and the eight companies on the island totalled the highest tally of the bloc with $35.1 billion (€31.6 billion) in arms sales last year.</p>
      <p>"Six of the eight UK-based companies listed in the Top 100 reported a reduction in arms sales in 2018," Nan Tian, a SIPRI researcher said in a statement. "This was partly due to delays in the UK's arms modernisation programmes."</p>
      <p>France came a distant second with $23.2 billion (€20.9 billion) in sales last year, boosted by a sharp 30% increase in sales from the Dassault Aviation Groupe which exports Rafale combat aircraft.</p>
      <p>Trans-European firms, Airbus and MBDA, were the third biggest sellers of arms from the Old Continent, with a combined $15.4 billion (€13.9 billion) in sales. They were followed by Italian and German firms which sold $11.7 billion (€10.5 billion) and $8.4 billion (€7.6 billion) of arms and military equipment respectively.</p>
      <h3>US and Russia are top arms sellers</h3>
      <p>Globally, sales rose by 4.6% year-on year to $420 billion (€379.2 billion) with US-based companies getting the lion share.</p>
      <p>For the first time since 2002, the top five spots in the rankings are held by American companies which, alone, accounted for 35% of the total Top 100 sales or $148 billion (€133.6 billion). Total arms sales of US companies amounted to $246 billion (€222.1 billion) or 59% of the Top 100 total.</p>
      <p>"US companies are preparing for the new arms modernisation programme that was announced in 2017 by President (Donald) Trump," Aude Fleurant, director of SIPRI's Arms and Military Expenditure programme said.</p>
      <p>"Large US companies are merging to be able to produce the new generation of weapon systems and therefore be in a better position to win contracts from the US government," she added.</p>
      <p>Russia, meanwhile, cemented its second place acquired last year with sales worth $36.2 billion (€32.7 billion). These were boosted by the country's top arms producer, Almaz-Antey, whose sales grew 18%.</p>
      <p>"This increase was due not only to strong domestic demand, but also to continued growth in sales to other countries, particularly the S-400 air defence system," Alexandra Kuimova, a SIPRI researcher explained.</p>
      <p>One of the acquirers of the Russian-made defence system is Turkey, whose decision to do so earlier this year angered its fellow NATO allies and saw it expelled from a joint F-35 striker jet programme.</p>
      <p>European countries including France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and Sweden also slapped Ankara with an arms ban in mid-October over Ankara's military incursion in northern Syria against Western-backed Kurdish fighters.</p>
