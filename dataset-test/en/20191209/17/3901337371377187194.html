      <p>Kaizer Chiefs fans are relishing in the rich goal-scoring form of Serbian hitman Samir Nurkovic. The striker’s lethal form is one of the many reasons why Amakhosi sit pretty atop the Absa Premiership standings.</p>
      <p>However, some fans fear that the lanky striker could be prized away from Naturena in the near future.</p>
      <p>SL Supporter @ Thamsa@ Naturena feels that top European teams will soon turn their attention to ‘Kokota’ should his rich vein of form continue.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I feel that we might lose Nurkovic to an overseas team in the near future if he continues to make scoring goals look so simple, because those who never noticed him are beginning to do so.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Eight league goals in 13 league matches played makes for impressing reading, considering that the Serbian was sidelined with injury for a few weeks.</p>

      </p>
      <p>SL Supporter @L &amp; B=M echoes the sentiments and feels that Nurkovic could easily slot into any of the top leagues in world football.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“To be honest Samir Nurkovic is not deserving to play in our PSL. That guy is a Top Striker. He's good from head to feet. I still wonder why European teams did fail to identify such good players like him. He can fit in to play in any top league in the world.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>For all the praise the Chiefs striker has received there are those like SL Supporter @Mekwaem who questions the standard of the PSL rather than praise Nurkovic’s exploits.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“This Nurkovic was an ordinary player and again playing in second division where he comes from. Here in SA he becomes a star. The standard of our league leaves much to be desired.”</i>

        <b>Do you think Nurkovic could be lured away from Kaizer Chiefs should his form continue?</b>
