      <h1>White Island eruption: Australian politician David Leyonhjelm blasted for 'insensitive' tweet</h1>

      <p>A controversial Australian politician has been criticised online for a tweet in response to the White Island eruption. </p>
      <p>The natural disaster, which took place on Monday afternoon, has taken the life of at least five people and caused significant injuries to many others. Police believe the death toll will rise, with many others remaining on the island who aren't believed to have survived.</p>
      <p>Extraordinary photos of the eruption have gone viral around the world, with some shared on Twitter by Michael Schade who had just left the island after a tour. </p>
      <p>One response to a video he posted of the event was from former Australian Senator David Leyonhjelm, who retired from federal politics earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The former Liberal Democratic Party member wrote: "but the emissions..."</p>

      <p>Video shared by Schade showed an enormous amount of ash spewing from the volcano, with Leyonhjelm's comment appearing to make reference to global warming and scientists' calls to lower CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p>His comment has been met with outrage online.</p>
      <p>"People have died or been injured. Grow up," wrote one person.</p>
      <p>"People are dead and missing, you insensitive dolt," wrote another. "I supposed you'll be cracking wise about the bushfires next - I mean what's the loss of life and property in comparison to a chance to drag out your tired, old talking points?"</p>
      <p>Others overlooked the perceived insensitivity of the comment and engaged with the topic of emissions. </p>
      <p>"...would have to be three times Mt St Helens plus one Pinatubo eruption per day to come close to human emissions."</p>
      <p>Someone else questioned whether Leyonhjelm knew the "difference between ash and greenhouse gasses"?</p>
      <p>Leyonhjelm caused controversy last year for comments against Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, a member of Australia's Green Party. </p>
      <p>In November he was ordered to pay Hanson-Young $120,000 after he lost a defamation case resulting from the comments.</p>
