        <i>Hi Brenda,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I have been into this relationship for six months. He has an eight year-old son from his past relationship.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>He promised to marry me, but was only good to me for the first three months. Things turned sour as the relationship continued.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>He has been lying to me. Whenever I call, he declines and if he picks up, he tells me to stop disturbing him.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Should I continue with that relationship?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Destiny's Child.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Dear Destiny’s Child,</p>
      <p>The writing is on the wall. I was feeling bad as I read your story because if we’re being honest, you and I both know that when a man starts acting like this, he is done.</p>
      <p>If he wanted you, he would be clear. Now that he doesn’t, he’s trying to drive you away.</p>
      <p>He could only maintain the charade for three months (as he promised to marry you), and then now as he tells you to stop disturbing him, you should listen.</p>
      <p>Stop disturbing him and stop disturbing your spirit. It’s over, because he didn’t have the guts to be honest.</p>
      <p>Leave it be.</p>
