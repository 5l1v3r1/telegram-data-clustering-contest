      <h1>Phillip Schofield's former co-star brands him a 't**t' amid 'complaints' row</h1>
      <h2>Former Emmerdale and Tracy Beaker star Connor Byrne vented on Twitter: "I can categorically state cuddly Phil is a total t**t"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:35:25+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Phillip Schofield's former co-star Connor Byrne branded the This Morning host a 'total t**t' and said he 'wasn't surprised' to hear the recent allegations against him.</p>
      <p>57-year-old Phil hit the headlines this weekend accused of creating a 'toxic' atmosphere on This Morning and ' being embroiled in feuds' with Holly Willoughby, Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes.</p>
      <p>Actor Byrne, who appeared in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat alongside Phil, took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to share his thoughts on the ITV presenter.</p>
      <p>His angry rant came days after Philip was slammed for 'cosying' up to Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> on the daytime show last week.</p>

      <p>Byrne fired: "I've seen a lot of the nonsense on here about Philip Schofield's encounter with the duplicitous Bulsh*t Johnson this morning and, having worked with Mr Schofield I can categorically state cuddly Phil is a total t**t. So, it's no surprise.</p>
      <p>"Schofield only serves Schofield," he added.</p>
      <p>A rep for Phil has been contacted by Mirror Online for comment.</p>

      <p>Defiant Philip returned to daytime TV earlier today following the recent storm against him.</p>
      <p>Some viewers claimed to notice some tension between Schofield and Holly with one commenting "you could cut the atmosphere with a knife."</p>
      <p>An ITV spokesman said about the rumours: ‘Phillip is a much respected broadcaster. This appears to be a desperate attempt to tarnish his reputation by maliciously motivated gossip’</p>

      <p>While Holly returned to work as usual on Monday, her occasional stand-in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amanda-holden">Amanda Holden</a> did speak out on to address the furore.</p>
      <p>The BGT judge was quizzed on the rumours by her Heart FM family live on air.</p>
      <p>Ashley Roberts began: "Lots of buzz around Philip Schofield at the moment. There are reports that things are a little tense between him and Holly Willoughby as well as Ruth Langsford. ITV says it's just gossip and that he and Holly are great friends, both on and off screen."</p>
      <p>"If only there was someone here who might be able to help us with that story," joked Amanda's co-host Jamie Theakston.</p>
      <p>"Listen, I've drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip," Amanda said guardedly.</p>
      <p>"Just give us some kind of...?" asked Jamie hopefully.</p>
      <p>"Well I'm just gonna say that I really admire anyone that sticks up for themselves because it is not an easy thing to do," Amanda said.</p>

      <p>"There is a tin opener and there's a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener. That's all I'm saying," she added.</p>
      <p>Amanda has made no secret of her dislike of Schofe, who she blamed for scuppering her chance of hosting This Morning while Holly Willoughby was away in Australia hosting last year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!.</p>
      <p>Amanda was said to have landed her dream job on a temporary basis - but the offer was withdrawn after Phil allegedly told ITV bosses he didn't want her sharing his sofa.</p>
      <p>Holly's role ended up being given to former pop star Rochelle Humes, 29.</p>
