      <p>It was an extremely valuable gift, allowing the burgh to generate significant income and to lay the basis for the ‘Common Good Fund’ which survives to this day.</p>
      <p>It also enabled Aberdeen to become a significant economic and political power in late-medieval and early-modern Scotland.</p>
      <p>The document celebrates its 700th anniversary tomorrow (Tuesday 10 December) and will go on show at a free talk being held in Aberdeen to discuss its impact on the city.</p>

      <p>Mr Astley will give a talk on the Stocket Charter with Professor Steve Boardman of the University of Edinburgh at</p>
      <p>Cowdray Hall, Schoolhill, Aberdeen on Wednesday, December 10 at 7.30pm.</p>
