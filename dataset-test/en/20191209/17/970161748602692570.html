      <h1>James Jordan kicks off over Kelvin Fletcher's perfect Strictly score</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:23:06+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Isobel Lewis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-jordan/">James Jordan</a> has criticised Motsi Mabuse for giving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kelvin-fletcher/">Kelvin Fletcher</a> 10 points for his ‘not great’ Paso Doble in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> semi-final.</p>
      <p>The Emmerdale actor was left fighting back tears on Saturday night as he topped the leaderboard after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/07/strictlys-kelvin-fletcher-fights-tears-finally-lands-perfect-40-oti-mabuse-11408411/">being awarded a perfect 40</a> for his Quickstep to The Lady is a Tramp and gaining a 10 for his Paso Doble with partner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/oti-mabuse/">Oti Mabuse</a>.</p>
      <p>However, for outspoken former Strictly pro James, Kelvin’s second ten from Motsi for his fiery Paso was totally unjustified, telling <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2019120881692/james-and-ola-jordan-strictly-come-dancing/">HELLO!</a>: ‘In my opinion, when Motsi gave Kelvin and Oti a ten for their Paso Doble, there was no way on this world it was a ten.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Kelvin made mistakes, he nearly fell over in the end! I love Kelvin and I want him to win but you have to be realistic and honest and his Paso Doble wasn’t great.</p>
      <p>‘I expected it to be much better because it’s a dance of power and strength and I thought, “It’s probably going to be one of his best dances,” but the choreography wasn’t great and it wasn’t one of his best performances, so it was a bit disappointing.’</p>
      <p>Before you get too upset (and by you, we mean us), James still had good things to say about the frontrunner, adding: ‘That being said, he was the strongest of the week, but I thought the performances were better the week before.’</p>

      <p>Heading into next Saturday’s final alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/karim-zeroual/">Karim Zeroual</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emma-barton/">Emma Barton</a>, picking up a perfect 40 puts Kelvin in good stead for the Glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>However, all three finalists will face their biggest challenge yet as they have to perform three different dances, including the famously difficult, nothing-off-limits showdance.</p>
      <p>And there was Kelvin finding learning two routines for the semi-final difficult enough, telling Claudia Winkleman: ‘It’s been a really hard week. Obviously, we’re all been in the same boat. Two dances in the space of a week, it was so daunting but I’ve given it my all.</p>
      <p>‘Oti’s been incredible this week and to get those comments… it means so much it really does.’</p>
      <p>Aw, you guys!</p>
