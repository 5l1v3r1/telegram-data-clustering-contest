      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino liked to keep Tottenham’s best youngsters at the club.</h2>

      <p>Jose Mourinho could let Tottenham Hotspur pair Oliver Skipp and Japhet Tanganga leave on loan in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/why-tottenham-fans-will-see-a-lot-more-of-troy-parrott-under-jose-mourinho-a4308771.html">According to The London Evening Standard</a>, Mourinho is considering loan moves for his best young players. This will be a change in policy at Tottenham after Mauricio Pochettino’s stance.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was insistent that the best young players remained in and around the Tottenham team. The likes of Kyle Walker-Peters and Harry Winks, who are now in the first-team squad, never spent time on loan.</p>
      <p>There are three players who fall into this category at the moment. Pochettino did not want to let Troy Parrott, Skipp or Tanganga leave on loan. These three players are on the periphery of the Spurs first-team squad.</p>

      <p>Mourinho rates Parrott highly and with a lack of depth in the striker department, the Irish striker could stick around. But Tanganga and Skipp might be spending some time on loan in the Premier League or the Championship.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>A loan spell could be the making of Skipp or Tanganga. Both players have shown plenty of promise but they are not quite ready to be playing each week for Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Pochettino’s plan ensured Tottenham had squad depth but Walker-Peters’ development has struggled as a result. Tanganga and Skipp should seek loan moves to show why they can be Spurs players in 2020/21.</p>
