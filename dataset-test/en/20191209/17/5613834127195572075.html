      <h1>“The Witcher” Featurettes: Get to Know the Complex Characters in the Netflix Series [Video]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:26:46+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>It has taken me several tries to get the hang of “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt”, the popular video game based on the book series that’s been adapted into a Netflix series. It’s incredibly complex and features several rich characters that inherit extremely convoluted mythology.</p>
      <p>With that, Netflix’s <b>“The Witcher”</b> series is a hard sell for those unacquainted with the source material.  Thankfully, they’ve cut together three character profiles in the following video featurettes that share insight into Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri, direct from the actors that play them (<b>Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra </b>and<b> Freya Allan</b>, respectively) and showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich.</p>
      <p>Arriving on Netflix <b>December 20th</b>, “The Witcher” is an epic tale of fate and family. The story of the intertwined destinies of three individuals in the vast world of The Continent, where humans, elves, witchers, gnomes, and monsters battle to survive and thrive, and where good and evil is not easily identified.</p>
      <p>If the series is anything like the games, expect an <i>insane</i> amount of blood and guts.</p>
