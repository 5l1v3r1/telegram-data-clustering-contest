      <p>Would you leave your baby alone at home to go work out next door?</p>
      <p>That’s what one Canadian dad is asking social media website Reddit this week.</p>
      <p>The man, who identifies just as a divorced dad with a nine-month-old baby, said his ex-wife thought it was the “worst thing I can do to the child.”</p>
      <p>“I grew up in Switzerland before moving to Canada and leaving children unattended at home is somewhat common, not quite a social faux-pas as it is here,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The dad has custody of his nine-month-old baby three days a week, uses a baby monitor to watch the child from afar, and only goes to the gym when she is asleep.</p>
      <p>“I live in a main floor apartment and gym is right next door. From my patio door it’s 30 second walk to the gym,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The post is on a sub-forum on Reddit where commenters vote if the poster is in the wrong.</p>
      <p>Commenters largely agreed that leaving the baby in this scenario was not a big deal, but many wondered why the dad had to work out on those three days.</p>
      <p>“[He] doesn’t HAVE to work out on the three days he has his kid, or he could work out from home on those days if he needs to, or he could find a gym with childcare,” one commenter wrote.</p>
      <p>“It no different from living in a big house and being down stairs while the baby is asleep upstairs,” another said.</p>
      <p>Others pointed out that if anything happens, courts may not side with the dad.</p>
      <p>“If God forbid something were to happen to the baby, the mother could sue [the dad] for full custody and… she would win.”</p>
