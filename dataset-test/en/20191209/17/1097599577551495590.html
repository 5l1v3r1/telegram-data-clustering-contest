      <p>Following on from huge support in recent years Cllr Lee calls for support with his food appeal this Christmas.</p>
      <p>“At a time where it can be very very difficult for families it’s very important as a community that we support one another at a time that can be very difficult,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I've seen how beneficial this appeal is to families and the happiness it brings by helping them out. It’s absolutely heart warming to see a smile on their face when I arrive with some food to the household and how grateful they are to receive it.</p>
      <p>“I've been doing this appeal over five years now and this year I ask you please to support the appeal if at all possible. There will be kind hearted people who support this initiative every year and thankfully they have come on board again this year. There is also huge work done by voluntary groups like the Lions Club, SVDP and others so whatever way you can help, please do as it’s greatly appreciated.” Families who wish to avail of this appeal - Shane can be contacted on 086 - 3296667 in the strictest of confidence.</p>
