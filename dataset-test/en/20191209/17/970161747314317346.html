      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn refuses to say if he will quit if Tories win General Election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:17:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author">James Hockaday</a></address>
      <p>Labour’s leader has refused to be drawn on whether he will stand down if <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> wins the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>It comes after his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/boris-refuses-say-will-resign-tories-lose-election-11409453/">Tory rival did exactly the same thing</a> when asked if he would quit his post three times Sunday.</p>
      <p>When asked during an election visit to Bristol today, Jeremy Corbyn said: ‘We put forward a positive manifesto with a fully costed programme and I am taking that message out all over the country.</p>
      <p>‘That message is getting home to people. They realise this Thursday is a straight choice: do you want to carry on with austerity and underfunding of public services or do you want a Labour government that will tax fairly to fund properly.’</p>
      <p>Corbyn also said he ‘never commentated’ on opinion polls, some of which have suggested a Conservative victory.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘Labour’s going to win on Thursday. I am concentrating solely on getting the message out all over Britain between now and Thursday when we can elect a Labour government.’</p>
      <p>It comes after speculation Shadow Chancellor <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/jeremy-corbyn-poised-hand-john-mcdonnell-loses-election-11410779/">John McDonnell would take charge of the party</a> on Friday if Labour are not brought into office.</p>
      <p>But a source close to Corbyn branded the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-not-trying-to-win-election-kxj0xdn3k?wgu=270525_54264_15759105041469_00b7127381&amp;wgexpiry=1583686504&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">report in the Sunday Times</a> as an ‘invention’ and insisted his plan for Friday is ‘to be Prime Minister’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to a crowd of thousands at Bristol’s College Green the Labour leader ripped into the Tory government’s record on the NHS and described hospital waiting times as ‘very bad’.</p>
      <p>He held up a copy of the Daily Mirror showing a four-year-old boy with pneumonia lying on the floor of a hospital and called it a ‘disgrace’.</p>

      <p>The Labour hopeful added: ‘More people are waiting for years and years, more people waiting for elective surgery and more people waiting for cancer care.</p>
      <p>‘We simply have to invest in our NHS and 40,000 nurse vacancies are just one of the many problems the NHS faces. It needs the resources and a Labour government would provide them.’</p>
      <p>He said problems faced by the health service which ‘did not exist in 2009/2010’ have come as a result of funding cuts under the Conservative and Lib Dem coalition government.</p>
      <p>Corbyn was asked about shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s claim some of Labour’s opponents ‘hate’ the people of Britain.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I think it is pretty clear they have a sense of contempt for the poorest working class communities across Britain.</p>

      <p>‘They have seen their local services cut because of the underfunding of local government and have seen so many people lose good jobs and end up on zero hours contracts or insecure employment. Things must change in this country.’</p>
      <p>Before the Labour leader’s arrival at College Green, a small protest took place against racism and discrimination against Jewish people within his party.</p>
      <p>When asked about the issue Corbyn said: ‘Anti-Semitism is a disgrace and a disgusting thing in our society and I have done absolutely everything to make sure there are rule changes in our party to make sure it is driven out altogether. I have spent my life campaigning against racism.’</p>
      <p>Corbyn said there was a ‘very clear choice’ on Thursday as he referred to a UN report comparing the Tories slashing of the UK’s ‘social safety net’ to a human rights violation.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘When the United Nations condemns austerity in one of the richest countries in the world then it is time to get rid of the Government that brought austerity to this country.’</p>
