      <p>Christmas may be just around the corner, . There is still time to buy last minute Christmas gifts, right up until the day itself. Here, we talk you through the last days to order from the likes of Amazon and other online retailers, as well as last minute gifts that don’t require delivery at all.</p>
      <p>If you're still stuck for what to buy, you might find our round-up of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/best-christmas-movies-on-netflix-amazon-prime-sky-talktalk-tv-freeview-tv-3592122/">best Christmas gifts of the year</a> useful.</p>
      <h3>Last days to order from Amazon</h3>
      <p>The last days to order from Amazon will depend on whether or not you have Prime, or how much you’re willing to pay to get your items on time.</p>
      <p>If you haven't already used your Amazon Prime 30 day free trial (you can use it once a year) we'd highly recommend doing so in order to save money on your deliveries this Christmas. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/landing?ascsubtag=06-3669238-11-0000000">You can sign up to the 30-day free trial here</a>.</p>
      <h4>Without Prime  </h4>
      <p><b>Free delivery:</b> Order by Friday 20 December at 11:59pm</p>
      <p><b>Standard delivery:</b> Order by Sunday 22 December at 9:30am</p>
      <p><b>One-day delivery (£5.99 per delivery for non-Prime members):</b> Order by Monday 23 December, by last order time (as listed on product page) to receive the item by Christmas Day. This also depends on the item and your location.</p>
      <p><b>Same-day delivery (evening delivery):</b> Order by Tuesday 24 December at midday if you're in Greater London or in one of the other <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b/?node=5782509031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3669238-11-0000000">eligible cities</a>.</p>
      <h4>With Prime</h4>
      <p>Prime Members receive free One-Day delivery as the default option (that is, if the product you buy is eligible for One-Day delivery).</p>
      <p><b>One-day delivery:</b> Order by Saturday 23 December, last order time depends on the item and your location. The item should arrive by 24 December.</p>
      <p><b>Same-day delivery:</b> Order by Sunday 24 December at midday if you live in one of the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b/?node=5782509031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3669238-11-0000000">14 eligible cities</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prime Now</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Order by 24 December (Christmas Eve) -  </b>Get free 2-hour delivery by midnight on Christmas Eve for order values over £40 if you order by 9:15pm (7:15pm in Glasgow). One-hour delivery will cost £7.99 and orders must be made by 10:59pm for delivery by midnight.

      <p>
        <b>Christmas Day - No deliveries made</b>
      </p>
