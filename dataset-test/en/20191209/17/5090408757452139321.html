      <p>President Donald Trump’s impeachment is a key issue uniting multiple contenders for Time’s 2019 Person of the Year.</p>
      <p>The shortlist was released Monday on the <a href="https://www.today.com/news/who-will-be-time-s-2019-person-year-see-shortlist-t169374">“Today”</a> show, and making the list are President Trump himself, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the whistleblower whose report sparked the investigation into the administration’s dealings with the Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Like many years, politics was a leading force in choosing contenders for the shortlist. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, teen environmental activist Greta Thunberg, and the Hong Kong protesters round out most of the rest of the list.</p>
      <p>Soccer player Megan Rapinoe, who helped lead the US women’s national soccer team to their second straight World Cup victory, was likely taken into consideration for her outspoken activism for pay equity in sports and beyond.</p>
      <p>Jamal Khashoggi and other murdered or oppressed journalists were named the <a href="https://www.insider.com/time-person-of-the-year-2018-2018-12">2018 Person of the Year.</a></p>
      <p>The 2019 Person of the Year will be announced Wednesday on the “Today” show. Continue to read the full shortlist.</p>
