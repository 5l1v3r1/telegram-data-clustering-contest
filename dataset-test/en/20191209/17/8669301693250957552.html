      <p>The coach of U-17 women’s Indian football team, Thomas Dennerby, on Monday said his players were good and they have been working hard ahead of the three-nation tournament, which begins in Mumbai on Friday. He also said the tournament was a good platform to judge where his team stands at the moment.</p>
      <p>“It is a very exciting time. It has been good to start learning about the players both on and off the pitch. So far from what I’ve seen, I can say that the girls are very good and have been working very hard,” Dennerby was quoted as saying in a release issued by the All India Football Federation.</p>
      <p>“Of course, there are things we need to develop and work on – and that is the reason we are here,” he added.</p>
      <p>The U-17 Women’s Football Tournament 2019 will be held from December 13 to 19 where India is set to face Sweden and Thailand. The U-17 team arrived in the city on Monday.</p>
      <p>This tournament will also be a first for Dennerby after he took charge in November. Given the quality of the opposition side, Dennerby said the matches will be a nice start to understand where the team stands.</p>
      <p>“We hope to have a good tournament. It is exciting to play friendlies against good opponents and it will be a nice start to see where we are at the moment. It will also tell us the areas of the game where we need to work on,” the 60-year-old added.</p>
