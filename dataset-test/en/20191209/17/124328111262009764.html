      <p>An inquest into the death of a Somali schoolgirl could look into allegations she was 'coerced' into going to the river where she drowned.</p>
      <p>Shukri Yahye-Abdi, 12, who was born in Somalia before moving to the UK, was pulled from the River Irwell near Bury town centre on June 27 after her mother had reported her missing.</p>
      <p>A pre-inquest review hearing in Heywood on December 9 heard there were claims Shukri, who couldn't swim, was being bullied and was 'coerced' by other girls into going to the river on the day of her death.</p>
      <p>Shukri's mother, Zamzam Ture, who appeared at Bury Coroner's Court today, said her daughter was bullied at school, could not swim and was wearing full Islamic dress on the day she died.  </p>
      <p>Her family insist her death was not an accident, but Greater Manchester Police said the alleged bullying claims 'doesn't match' with their investigation. </p>
      <p>Today senior coroner Joanne Kearsley said there was a 'question as to whether alleged bullying was relevant to the inquest'.</p>
      <p>In response, Ashley Underwood QC, representing Shukri's family, replied 'considerably'.</p>
      <p>He added: 'The other component is the degree to which there was a relationship of violence between the girls and the degree to which we should be permitted to ask the children about the background to the day.'</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When Ms Kearsley asked what violence had taken place, she was told there had been an incident of 'pushing' about six months before Shukri's death.</p>
      <p>Mr Underwood said there was also 'a question of whether, on the day, there was coercion', with Shukri being persuaded against her will to go to the river.</p>
      <p>Mr Kearsley said she would consider the scope of the inquest and report back to all interested parties within seven days.</p>
      <p>Reporting restrictions have been put in place preventing the identification of four children Shukri had contact with after leaving school the day she died.</p>
      <p>The children were referred to as child one, two, three and four.</p>
      <p>The coroner also said she had 'real concerns' whether the children are 'fit enough to give evidence'.</p>
      <p>She added: 'I think concerns have been raised by other agencies working with the children.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>'I am going to make some enquiries as to whether the children are able to give evidence from a health perspective.'</p>
      <p>Ms Kearsley said that if any of the children are to appear before the inquest it will be done via video link.</p>
      <p>The inquest was adjourned until late February.</p>
      <p>Shukri's loved ones have said she was being bullied at school and say the investigation into her death was treated differently because of their race, background and refugee status. </p>
      <p>They claim the police response was laced with institutional racism. </p>
      <p>Her devastated family did not speak to reporters today, but the lawyer representing them said Ms Ture was reliving the pain again.   </p>
      <p>Mr Attiq Malik, said: 'The family are mourning every time something new happens, it really brings it all back. </p>
      <p>'It's heart wrenching to see the mother and how upset she gets.</p>

        <figcaption>Her mother, Zam Zam Ture (pictured in the aftermath) says police have not properly investigated her daughter's death and are wrong to say it was an accident</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'It's like she's reliving it all again so from that point of view we want it over and done sooner rather than later. </p>
      <p>At a press conference in August, the family's solicitor Attiq Malik revealed that an internal inquiry at Broad Oak Sports College, which has since been renamed Hazel Wood High School, found the school were 'not aware of any bullying of Shukri'.</p>
      <p>At the same conference, one of Shukri's friends insisted she was being bullied.</p>
      <p>She said: 'She wanted friends, she wanted to be accepted. She was lonely. If somebody wanted to be her friend she would do anything.'</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the child's death.</p>
      <p>An inquiry by the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into the way GMP handled the investigation is ongoing.</p>

        <figcaption>Shukri's family gather at the River Irwell where she died - but say she couldn't swim and cannot understand why police say she was</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'It was necessary to delay matters today to make sure the inquest is a full and proper one.' </p>
      <p>Shukri, who came to the UK from Somalia, was described by relatives as a 'sweet, innocent child'.</p>
      <p>She was reported missing by her mother just after 7.30pm on June 27 and a short time later police received a separate report that a girl had gone into the River Irwell and had not resurfaced.</p>
      <p>Underwater search teams later recovered her body from the river.</p>
      <p>Following her death, police said there were no suspicious circumstances and warned people of the dangers of swimming in rivers, lakes and reservoirs in hot weather.</p>
      <p>Mustaf Omar Mohamed, Shukri's cousin, told Muslim news website <a href="https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/07/04/family-of-drowned-bury-schoolgirl-say-they-dont-believe-it-was-an-accident/"><b>5 Pillars</b></a> while the police have repeatedly told the media it was a tragic accident, they do not believe her death was an accident. </p>
      <p>'We believe there is more to this story and we don't believe we are getting the answers and support we deserve from the police and the school,' Mr Mohamed said. </p>
      <p>'We know that Shukri was being bullied and so do the school and the police. It was name-calling and physical. </p>
      <p>'I don't know why she was being bullied but she was a timid, scared, vulnerable girl so she was an easy target. Her mum went to the school to report it and was even in the process of taking her out of the school,' he added. </p>
