      <h2>It happened on the number three bus near Shirehampton</h2>

      <p>A teenager threw a brick through a bus window, almost hitting a passenger's head.</p>
      <p>The object was hurled at the number three bus near Shirehampton as it made its way from Cribbs Causeway to Bristol city centre.</p>
      <p>It happened yesterday (December 8) at around 6.25pm.</p>
      <p>First Bus is investigating the incident.</p>
      <p>Passenger Emma Mace, aged 39, of Lawrence Weston, said: “It was quite shocking, really, because it’s the last thing you’re expecting.</p>
      <p>"There was a poor guy sat at the back of the bus and the brick missed him by inches.”</p>
      <p>The retail worker said before the incident there had been some disruption on the upper deck before two teenage boys got off the bus.</p>
      <p>As it pulled away from the stop the brick was thrown.</p>
      <p>Miss Mace, who was on her way to a staff party, said: “The bus started pulling out and then all of a sudden the brick came through the window.</p>
      <p>“I normally sit at the back but I decided to sit in the middle. If I’d gone where I normally sit, the brick would have hit me.”</p>
      <p>She described the boys who came off the bus as around 13 to 14 years old, but said she was not able to give more full descriptions.</p>
      <p>Passengers had to wait for around 25 minutes before they could catch another bus, said Miss Mace, who made it to her party around 45 minutes late.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/firstgroup">First West of England’s</a> director of operations for Bristol, Ian Coyle, said: “We can confirm that an object was thrown at a window of a service three between <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avonmouth">Avonmouth </a>and Shirehampton at around 18.25 on Sunday.</p>
