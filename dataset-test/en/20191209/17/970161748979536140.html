      <p>The cast, crew and fans of hit-<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> show, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/01/netflix-series-see-us-cast-trailer-true-story-central-park-five-9772253/">When They See Us</a>, woke up this morning to zero <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/golden-globes/">Golden Globe</a> nominations and it’s absolutely out of order.</p>
      <p>It follows the true story of the Central Park Five – five teenage boys of colour who were wrongly convicted of a crime they didn’t commit.</p>
      <p>The case was controversial and well-publicised when it first broke, and now, 30 years later and through Ava DuVernay’s lens, we can see a dramatic re-telling of the story unfold in a four-part series.</p>
      <p>While the official Twitter account for the show hasn’t responded to the snub, director Ava has and it she decided to rise above it all.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: ‘WHEN THEY SEE US is trending nationally. A good thing. More light on the Exonerated 5 and the system of mass criminalization this nation has constructed. For more, watch the project on @Netflix. For even more, go to @ColorofChange or @Innocence.’</p>

      <p>Other fans weren’t as composed and didn’t hold back on their criticism.</p>
      <p>The Perfection star Logan Browning led the criticism: ‘The #goldebglobes noms just broke my heart. I didn’t want to care, but finding the people of color is an unfruitful scavenger hunt. All white, male directors.</p>
      <p>‘Whoever nominates needs the bubble they occupy popped ASAP. WHERE IS WHEN THEY SEE US? Oh right, they don’t.’</p>
      <p>You tell ’em, Logan.</p>
      <p>One fan of the show tweeted: ‘Wait, “When They See Us” isn’t nominated for a Golden Globe? Wow.’</p>
      <p>While another remarked: ‘When They See Us getting ZERO Golden Globe nominations tells you everything you need to know about the #GoldenGlobes.’</p>

      <p>Another pointed out a huge disparity: ‘When They See Us went from six Critics’ Choice noms to zero Golden Globes nominations in less than 24 hours.’</p>
      <p>And they’re not wrong – the film led the charge with one of the most amount of nominations for the 25th Annual Critics’ Choice Awards.</p>
      <p>Actor John Leguizamo tweeted after the announcement yesterday: Wow! This show is the most important I have ever been part of! Thank u @ava @netflix @exonerated. five @whentheyseeus and congrats Ava! And Asante! Doubles for you!’</p>
      <p>(The categories were Best Limited Series, Jharrel Jerome for Best Actor in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television, both Asante Blackk and John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie Made for TV or Limited Series, as well as both Marsha Stephanie Blake and Niecy Nash for Best Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television).</p>
      <p>Some consolation, but still – what were you thinking, Golden Globes?!</p>
