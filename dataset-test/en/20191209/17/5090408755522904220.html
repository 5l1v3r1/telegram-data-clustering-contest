        <li>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/watch">watch</a> is a status symbol and a statement, particularly for those in business.</li>
        <li>Business Insider spoke to the horological experts at Crown &amp; Caliber to identify the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/luxury-watches">luxury timepieces</a> worn by some of the world’s most <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/college-degrees-and-majors-of-famous-tech-ceos">powerful CEOs</a>.</li>

      <p>For some businessmen, a wristwatch is more than a time-telling device. It’s a statement.</p>
      <p>“A watch is the greatest icebreaker there is,” <a href="https://www.crownandcaliber.com/pages/who-we-are">Hamilton Powell</a>, the CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.crownandcaliber.com/">Crown &amp; Caliber</a>, an online secondary market for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-watches-displayed-at-watchtime-2019-11">luxury watches</a>, told Business Insider. “In an unfamiliar city, I can approach a complete stranger and with two words eradicate any barriers: ‘<i>Nice watch.'”</i></p>
      <p>“A watch tells people about the type of person you are and what you value,” Powell added. “The guy who wears a blinged-out gold-diamond Hublot is very different than the guy with a vintage stainless-steel Zenith chronograph.”</p>
      <p>With the help of Crown &amp; Caliber’s team of experts, we’ve put together a list of wristwatches worn by the former and current <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-ceos-in-world-harvard-business-review-excludes-jeff-bezos-2019-10">CEOs</a> of some of the world’s most powerful companies.</p>
      <p>Here are the timepieces favored by prominent executives, organized from the least to most expensive.</p>

      <h3>Bill Gates, the cofounder and former CEO of Microsoft</h3>

      <p>Bill Gates is the cofounder of Microsoft. He became a billionaire at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaire-bill-gates-net-worth-spending-2018-8#despite-his-massive-fortune-gates-previously-told-ellen-degeneres-that-when-he-became-a-billionaire-at-age-31-historys-youngest-billionaire-at-the-time-he-didnt-go-on-a-spending-spree-7">age 31.</a></p>
      <p>In November, he surpassed Jeff Bezos to reclaim his spot as the world’s richest person after two years in second place, according to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-overtakes-jeff-bezos-as-worlds-richest-person-bloomberg-2019-11">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>. But <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#7138a11e689f">Forbes’</a> current calculations are different, meaning the current ranking of the world’s wealthiest billionaires is unclear. Bloomberg estimates Gates’ current net worth to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/">$110 billion</a>, while Forbes has it at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#7138a11e689f">$106.8 billion</a>.</p>

He is <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/watches/article/bill-gates-casio">frequently seen</a> wearing Casio watches, specifically a <a href="https://www.casio.com/products/watches/sports/mdv106-1a">Casio Duro,</a> which retails for $70 or less.</p>

      <p>In November, Bezos was bumped back down to the world’s second-richest person, according to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-overtakes-jeff-bezos-as-worlds-richest-person-bloomberg-2019-11">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>. However, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#7138a11e689f">Forbes’</a> calculations are different, meaning the current ranking of the world’s billionaires is unclear.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg estimates Bezos’ net worth to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/">$109 billion</a> and Forbes estimates it to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/?list=rtb/#6dcae21b2382">$109.5 billion</a>.</p>
