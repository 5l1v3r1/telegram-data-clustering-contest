      <h1>Cricket: Sri Lankans touch down in Pakistan</h1>
      <h2>First Test tour in the country in 10 years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:29:14+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Sri Lanka embarked on the first Test cricket tour of Pakistan in 10 years on Monday following the deadly 2009 attack on its team that plunged Pakistan into sporting isolation.</p>
      <p>Touchdown Islamabad, tweeted the Pakistan Cricket Board, along with a video of the players at the airport, while PCB chief executive Waseem Khan called their arrival a “historic occasion”.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka will play two Tests under heavy security, one in Rawalpindi — where Pakistan's army is headquartered — and the second in Karachi, ending a decade-long absence for cricket's five-day format.</p>
      <p>“This is my first tour of Pakistan,” said Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth Karunaratne, who opted out of the team's recent limited-overs tour of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>“After the 2009 incidents players were scared to tour Pakistan but in the last two years or so Sri Lanka and other teams have toured Pakistan.</p>
      <p>“We want to play good cricket in Pakistan and hope they give us some good security,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka, despite being the target of the 2009 attack, has been a driving force behind the return of international cricket after it played six limited-overs matches in Karachi and Lahore in September and October.</p>
      <p>The series — the second for both teams in the ongoing World Test Championship — promises to be intriguing, not least because of the tussle between the two coaches: Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq and Sri Lanka's Mickey Arthur.</p>
      <p>Arthur was Pakistan coach until August when he was axed by the country's cricket officials, who included Misbah, following a disappointing performance at this year's World Cup.</p>
      <p>The South African, who was only appointed by Sri Lanka last week, will hope to pile the pressure on Pakistan which coming off a humiliating 2-0 Test thrashing in Australia.</p>
      <p>Misbah, who is also Pakistan's chief selector and batting coach, will be under especially heavy scrutiny following Pakistan's run of poor form.</p>
