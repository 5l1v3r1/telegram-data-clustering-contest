      <p>As reported before the chinese <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/elephone">ELEPHONE</a> brand is not holding back with their expansion plans and next target for it is Pakistan. Yesterday at the Serena hotel in Islamabad they had a big launch party and conference to usher the brand to the local market. It has been attended by more than 150 guests, including local government officials, operators, dealers, embassy officials, as well as local media journalists. Miss Hareem Farooq will also work together with them as a brand spokesperson to introduce ELEPHONE products to more Pakistani users.</p>
      <p>This conference symbolized the official beginning of the journey of ELEPHONE in Pakistan and of course the brand needs also the distribution platform. The <a href="http://elephone.pk/">official ELEPHONE Pakistan brand store is now online</a> too so itâ€™s already available and serving the local customers. The initial portfolio of products is maybe even bigger than originally expected and features not just phones, but also the smart wearables including watches and smartbands.</p>

      <p>Specifically there are phone models like the flagship ELEPHONE U2 with pop-up dual selfie cameras and Helio P70 processor, cheaper ELEPHONE PX with single pop-up selfie camera and Helio P23 or the budget ELEPHONE A6 Max and A6 Mini for the more money conscious users. And from the smart wearable section the Pakistani customer can choose from the W3 smartwatch model or Band 5 and W7 GPS smartband models.</p>
