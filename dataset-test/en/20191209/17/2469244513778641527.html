      <p>Communities secretary Robert Jenrick defended austerity cuts to the public sector finances during a visit to Devon.</p>
      <p>The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government was challenged over a decade of spending cuts.</p>
      <p>The Local Government Association estimates councils have lost almost £16 billion of funding since 2010, equal to 60p in every pound.</p>
      <p>In Plymouth, Labour council leader Tudor Evans said the cuts had resulted in the “hollowing out” of local government.</p>
      <p>Mr Jenrick said when the Conservatives came to power in 2010, they had to make “difficult choices” because Labour had left the economy “in ruins”.</p>

      <p>He said the new Tory administration under Boris Johnson had agreed the best local settlement in a decade for 2020/21, with up to £1.5bn extra for children’s and adult social care.</p>
      <p>Mr Jenrick said: “the Local Government Association itself warmly welcomed that settlement as putting local authorities on a much sounder financial footing, to continue their important role delivering those local public services that people really depend on.”</p>
      <p>The MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire was visiting Devon to support the Conservative candidates in Torbay and Totnes, Kevin Foster and Anthony Mangnall.</p>
      <p>Mr Jenrick said south Devon was heading in the right direction with unemployment at a record low and lots of people wanted to move there because it was such a “beautiful and vibrant part of the country”.</p>
      <p>He said there were challenges facing the area which is why the Government wanted to invest in it through the £3.6bn Towns Fund, which has seen Torquay invited to develop regeneration proposals for up to £25m of funding.</p>
