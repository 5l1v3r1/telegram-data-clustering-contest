      <p>Mr Tohouo is a Cameroonian while his late wife, Bernadett Kurucz, was from Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>Maersk Line, however, is the world’s largest container shipping company and is a subsidiary of Maersk Group, a Danish business conglomerate. Tohouo’s residence was invaded on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Reports also said the police have made two arrests, in connection with the robbery and murder.</p>
      <p>The police are yet to issue a statement on the incident.</p>
      <p>Tohouo who has been a long term staff of Maersk, serving in Guangzhou, China, Cameroon, was appointed into the position as MD in Nigeria in 2016. He also oversees Maersk’s operation in Benin, Niger, Togo and Ghana.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the deceased, after being separated from her husband, was compelled to wire money to the assailants after which she was forced to drink acid and suffocated with a pillow.</p>
      <p>Tohouo reportedly called the chief security officer of the company who led policemen to the scene and got two people arrested.</p>
      <p>Lagos police spokesperson, Bala Elkana, confirmed the incident to newsmen but did not reveal the suspects’ names.</p>
