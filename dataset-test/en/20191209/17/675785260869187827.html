      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:36:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, John Cross, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal are in the market for a new manager following Unai Emery's sacking.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg was put in temporary charge while the north London club looked for Emery's successor, and the Gunners are yet to confirm his replacement.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino, Massimiliano Allegri, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Brendan Rodgers are just some of the names linked with the top job at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>But none of them quite fit the bill like former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> midfielder, and current <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> assistant under Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta.</p>
      <p>Here are six reasons why Arteta is the perfect man to take Arsenal forward, as reported by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/who-should-become-next-arsenal-21056561">Mirror Sports chief football writer John Cross.</a></p>

      <p>Firstly, the Gunners do not have a huge budget to bring in a managerial titan, and a boss with the calibre of Allegri could command staggering wages.</p>
      <p>Secondly, while on the topic of Allegri, the Italian doesn't speak great English and parted company with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> after it became apparent the Serie A giants wanted to play more expansive football.</p>
      <p>Emery struggled to get his point across due to the language barrier at Arsenal, and his team selections were often criticised for lacking punch and aggression.</p>
      <p>Allegri, therefore, may just be too similar to Emery.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, it's no secret that Rodgers was Arsenal's first choice, and he would arguably be the best man for the job, but the Northern Irishman recently penned a new deal with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester City,</a> meaning he is out of the question.</p>

      <p>The fourth reason, which fans may ridicule, is that there is a feeling Nuno isn't great with the media.</p>
      <p>Dealing with the media is second nature for the likes of Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, and the Arsenal board want their next appointment to be a stronger character than Emery.</p>
      <p>Reason number five: on paper Pochettino sounds like a great manager to take Arsenal forward. He's young, progressive, knows the Premier League and achieved wonders at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham.</a></p>
      <p>But whether he'd cross the north London divide remains to be see, and Arsenal can't risk making a public approach only for him to turn them down.</p>

      <p>The sixth reason Arteta is the perfect man for the Gunners is that, simply, they need someone who knows the club, who can coach the players already there, and who can introduce a philosophy, quickly.</p>
      <p>Ivan Gazidis championed the Spaniard when Arsenal were looking for Arsene Wenger's replacement, but the older board members blocked the appointment in favour of experience.</p>
      <p>These board members are still at the club, meaning they could overlook Arteta again - who, admittedly is a risk - but in doing so may just make the same mistake again.</p>
