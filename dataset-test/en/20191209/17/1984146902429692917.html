      <p>Voters in Washington were told that not voting for Jeremy Corbyn "doesn't make you a Tory" as Boris Johnson paid a visit to the North East.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conservative">Conservative</a> leader took part in a question-and-answer session with employees at Ferguson's Transport in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/washington">Washington</a> as the final week of campaigning got under way.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was joined on stage by former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Labour</a> MP Gisela Stuart who said a vote for the Tories "allows us to get this job [Brexit] done".</p>
      <p>"It doesn't make me a Tory, and it doesn't make you a Tory," she told staff.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson told voters: "We've got to get <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> done because it's our democratic duty.</p>
      <p>"We've got to take advantage of all the benefits Brexit will bring, whether it's taking back control of our borders, our money, our laws, our immigration system.</p>
      <p>"We need to do it for the sake of our economy."</p>
      <p>The politician assured the audience that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Nissan</a> would be protected and that "we've got to get on with dualling the A1".</p>
      <p>Asked whether he thought "we will actually be better off leaving the EU", Mr Johnson said: "I do. There are lots of advantages in terms of immediate investment into the country.</p>
      <p>"The deal we have ready to go protects businesses, it protects supply chains, it means we leave the EU with our relationships absolutely intact.</p>

      <p>"It's absolutely vital we protect supply chains, we protect Nissan and make sure that people continue to invest in our country.</p>
      <p>"What businesses large and small want to see is the uncertainty about Brexit over."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was also asked why the Conservatives had put up candidates in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sundera">Sunderland</a> from Kensington, Kingston-upon-Thames and Warrington.</p>
      <p>He said it would be "unfair" to discriminate based on where someone is from, saying, "I don't remember Tony Blair having deep roots in Sedgefield."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was also asked about Conservative slashing council budgets in Sunderland and the NHS.</p>
      <p>He said: "We were in a difficult situation in 2010.</p>
      <p>"What will help this country is if we can get Brexit done and move forward. We can't focus on the plans we've got for this country when we're stuck with these delays.</p>
      <p>"We are putting the biggest ever investment into our NHS - Â£34bn - and I think that will be absolutely transformative."</p>
      <p>Asked whether he had done enough to win over voters in traditionally safe Labour seats, he said: "How am I supposed to know? I'm doing my best."</p>
      <p>Leading a demonstration outside was Labour candidate Sharon Hodgson, who accused Mr Johnson of "paying lip service" to Sunderland.</p>
      <p>She said: "He's not promising anything substantial for the North East and the lives of people here could be a lot worse under his Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>"He's just here to say 'look, I'm going to get Brexit done' and I hope the majority of voters are going to see through that."</p>
