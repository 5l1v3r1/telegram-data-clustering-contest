      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A purported member of the Almighty Latin Kings gang was held without bail Monday after pleading not guilty to murder in the stabbing death of a man at a Rhode Island hookah lounge.</p>
      <p>Joel Francisco faces a first-degree murder charge in the death Oct. 2 of Troy Pine, 46, at the Nara Lounge in Providence's Federal Hill neighborhood.</p>
      <p>The Providence Journal reports that Francisco, 41, was referred to the public defender's office. Assistant Attorney General Daniel Carr Guglielmo asked that he be ruled a habitual offender if convicted.</p>
      <p>Francisco stabbed Pine following a confrontation, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>He fled the state and was arrested by federal marshals on Oct. 19 in New Braunfels, Texas, as he allegedly tried to make it to Mexico.</p>
      <p>Francisco was one of 62 people federal prosecutors in Boston charged last week in an operation targeting the Latin Kings gang.</p>
      <p>He was convicted of trafficking crack cocaine and sentenced to life in prison in 2005.</p>
      <p>Francisco, however, was a beneficiary of the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform law signed by President Donald Trump in December that retroactively extended sentencing reductions for crack cocaine offenses.</p>
