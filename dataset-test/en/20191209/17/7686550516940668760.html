      <p>Jeremy Guscott has slated the English Premiership's refusal to switch their showpiece season finale in 2021 to allow Warren Gatland more preparation time for the Lions tour to South Africa.</p>
      <p>But the former Lions series winner believes Gatland can overcome the obstacles put in his way by Premiership Rugby and win the series if the World Cup-winning Springboks continue the 'flat-track bully' tactics they employed to great effect in Japan.</p>
      <p>Gatland has already voiced concerns over sufficient preparation time for his squad and PR chiefs have confirmed they will not rearrange their Gallagher Premiership play-off final.</p>
      <p>The Lions’ official confirmation of an eight-match itinerary means an opening fixture scheduled for the Saturday after England’s top two clubs go head-to-head at Twickenham.</p>
      <p>It is understood that as part of their tour build-up, the Lions would like to play a game – potentially on June 26 and possibly against the Barbarians – before departure.</p>
      <p>But Premiership Rugby said it had reached agreement with the RFU and RPA (Rugby Players Association) over the Premiership’s season structure more than 12 months ago "which gave everyone clarity on the future".</p>
      <p>But respected BBC TV pundit Guscott, whose drop-goal in the second Test gave the 1997 Lions victory on their South Africa tour, admits it 'beggars belief' Premiership Rugby cannot display any flexibility for the greater good of Gatland's tourists.</p>

      <p>Writing <a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/">in The Rugby Paper the mercurial</a> 65-times capped England midfielder, who made three tours with the Lions playing in eight Tests, said: "It is beyond me why they are not prepared to move the Premiership final forward by a week to support the Lions.</p>
      <p>"I cannot see why it is not possible to arrange it, and they should be honest about their reasons.</p>
      <p>"The game is a whole lot better for the Lions, so how come one of the leagues is blocking them, and not saying why it takes that view.</p>
      <p>"The Lions is a mutual benefit for everyone. Players return with bigger profiles, and that is of benefit to their clubs, to the league, and to its broadcasters and sponsors.</p>
      <p>"So why would a league like the Premiership, that supplies so many Lions players, hinder it by showing no flexibility when it comes to the greater good of the game? It beggars belief."</p>
      <p>The five-week eight-match tour kicks off against the Stormers in Cape Town on July 3 and culminates in the three Tests against the 'Boks - two of them at altitude in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>"We are going to find out just how difficult a five-week tour is - but I'm a realist, and we have to deal with what we're given," added Guscott. "What we know is that it was hard enough last time in New Zealand with just six weeks.</p>

      <p>"However if you have the physicality to confront the Springboks, as we did in 1997, and you also have a running game that can stretch them, you can beat them.</p>
      <p>"My feeling is that if South Africa continue to play as they are now, then they will lose to the 2021 Lions.</p>
      <p>"You cannot be a flat-track bully forever and expect the opposition to keep falling over: People like New Zealand, and the Lions, work you out, and beat you.</p>
      <p>"The future of the Lions is always an issue, and if the five-week tours mean that the Lions are beaten in three tours in succession, because they lose the first two Tests due to lack of preparation time, then people will start asking questions - even the players.</p>
      <p>"That's why it is as important as ever that they win the 2021 series."</p>
