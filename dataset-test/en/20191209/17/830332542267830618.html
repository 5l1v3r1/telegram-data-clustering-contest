      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Two masked and armed men confronted employees of PL$ Check Cashing as they were arriving to work Monday morning and demanded cash, according to an incident report.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the men ran off with money from one of the cash drawers at the business.</p>
      <p>Police said the victims believe two other co-conspirators stayed outside during the robbery. A K-9 search followed, but police were unable to find the suspects.</p>
