      <p><b>READING, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - A district attorney in southeastern Pennsylvania issued a public health warning Monday in the wake of a series of drug overdoses, some of them deadly, believed to involve the same substance.</p>
      <p>Berks County District Attorney John T. Adams said that a dozen people overdosed over the weekend in the city of Reading, West Reading borough, and Exeter and Rockland townships. Three died.</p>
      <p>The overdoses involved a substance believed to be cocaine laced with fentanyl or another opioid, he said. The drugs were packaged in clear plastic packets or baggies.</p>
      <p>Detectives are awaiting the results of toxicology testing.</p>
      <p>"We, as law enforcement, are combating this epidemic that has plagued our community with every resource available to us," Adams said in a statement, adding: "It is critical that the community remain vigilant and check on family and friends who may be using these dangerous drugs."</p>
