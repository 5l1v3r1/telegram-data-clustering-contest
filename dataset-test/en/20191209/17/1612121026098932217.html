      <p>OnePlus really isn’t much of a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340027-oneplus-7-pro-pricing-officially-confirms-oneplus-is-no-longer-a-budget-friendly-brand/">budget-friendly or midrange brand anymore</a>. When the phones originally launched they were priced well below the flagship category, but that’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/317378-opinion-oneplus-5-lost-identity-no-branding-message-price/">slowly crept up</a> over the years. Of course, newer OnePlus phones are also significantly better and have a broader feature set to match high-end phones from the other guys, so it makes sense.</p>
      <p>But it looks like 2020 will be the year OnePlus brings back a cheaper phone in their lineup. New renders for the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344783-oneplus-8/">OnePlus 8 Lite</a> have shown up, which should fill out their announcements next year alongside the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro.</p>
      <p>The Lite version of the phone definitely looks like something that could be mistaken for a Samsung device, including the flat edges, hole-punch display, and familiar camera module.</p>

      <p>It’s supposedly right around a 6.4 or 6.5-inch screen, which is pretty sizable, even for a “lite” phone. It also packs a dual-camera module and potentially a ToF sensor, a pretty slick looking color finish, and a USB-C port, plus the strong possibility of an in-display fingerprint scanner. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/347344-galaxy-note-10-lite-render/">No headphone jack, though</a>.</p>
      <p>OnePlus offered the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/phone/oneplus-x/">OnePlus X </a>a few years back, but it was a pretty short-lived experiment in the cheaper section of smartphones. This seems like another stab at that idea, which hopefully goes a bit better this time around.</p>
      <p>As soon as we hear anything else about potential specs or features, we’ll keep you updated. I’d be surprised if a phone like this kept things like that <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346234-oneplus-8-pro-120hz-screen-rumor/">high refresh rate display</a>, but you never know for sure with OnePlus.</p>
