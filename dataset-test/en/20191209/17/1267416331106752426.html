      <p>Ericsson has agreed to pay more than <a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1YA2HU-OCATC">$1 billion USD</a> (approximately $1.3 billion CAD) to resolve U.S. corruption probes.</p>
      <p>The probes from the U.S. government looked at corruption involving the bribing of government officials. The U.S. Department of Justice said that the bribery involved a number of countries including China and Vietnam and took place over many years.</p>
      <p>Ericsson admitted that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from 2000 and 2016 by bribing officials to get customers. It also falsified books and records.</p>
      <p>“Certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls,” Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm said in a conference call on December 7th, according to <a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1YA2HU-OCATC"><i>Reuters.</i></a></p>
      <p>“I view what has happened as a completely unacceptable and hugely upsetting chapter of our history,” he said during the call.</p>
      <p>Authorities say that the company bribed government officials to keep and secure its business. It also retained consultants to transfer money to third parties.</p>
      <p>Ericsson now says it has taken measures to improve its compliance and ethics. It says it has also reviewed its anti-corruption program.</p>
