      <h3>Bang Energy Girl Nina Serebrova Soaks Up The Sun In Neon Orange Bikini</h3>

      <p>Nina Serebrova started off her week by soaking up some sun in a tiny little bikini while in Miami, Florida. The Bang Energy model shared the photo and a video for her <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> fans to enjoy on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>In the steamy post, Nina is seen sporting a neon orange string bikini as she relaxes on a yellow and white lounge chair out on a balcony. The brunette beauty showcased her ample cleavage, toned arms, flat tummy, curvy hips, and long, lean legs in the skimpy two-piece as she told her fans in the caption that they should do Monday like she does.</p>
      <p>Nina wore her long, dark hair pushed to the side and styled in loose waves that fell down her body. She donned a pair of oversize sunglasses to shield her eyes from the sun’s rays as she laid with her arms behind her head looking comfortable.</p>
      <p>The model also appeared to wear a more natural makeup look for the shots, showing off defined eyebrows, a shimmering glow on her face, pink blush to bring out her cheekbones, and a pink tint to her full lips.</p>
      <p>In the background of the photo a city scene is visible, as well as a gorgeous blue sky complete with white fluffy clouds.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, many of Nina’s over 2.7 million followers were left stunned by the jaw-dropping post, and quickly showed their support for the snaps by clicking the like button over 5,700 times and leaving more than 80 comments in less than 20 minutes after the post went live on the network.</p>
      <p>“Orange bikini looks amazing on you,” one of Nina’s Instagram followers wrote in the comments section of the post.</p>

      <p>“Always so gorgeous Nina,” another fan said.</p>

      <p>“Sometimes your posts nearly gives me cardiac arrest,” a fourth social media user remarked.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5736318/nina-serebrova-lingerie-instagram/">The Inquisitr</a></i>, this isn’t the first time that Nina has wowed her followers with her flawless figure. Just last month got pulses racing in some white lingerie as she had her hair wrapped in a towel.</p>
      <p>Nina stood in her kitchen and put a loaf of bread to her mouth as she took a big bite with a look of happiness on her face. She also teased that she needed someone to bring her some coffee to go along with it.</p>
      <p>That post also proved to be a popular upload for Nina Serebrova, and has earned the model more than 40,000 likes and over 400 comments to date.</p>
