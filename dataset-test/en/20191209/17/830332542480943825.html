      <p>(CNN) - Serena Williams' smashed racket from her infamous US Open final defeat by Naomi Osaka has been sold for $20,910 at a New Jersey auction.</p>
      <p>Williams damaged the racket in the bad-tempered 2018 loss, a match which sparked controversy after the 23-time grand slam champion was docked a game for clashing with umpire Carlos Ramos.</p>
      <p>The item was one of a number pieces of well-known sporting memorabilia up for grabs at Goldin Auctions.</p>
      <p>A Jesse Owens gold medal from the 1936 Olympics was the most expensive lot, fetching $615,000, while a signed LeBron James rookie card from the 2003-4 season sold for $198,030.</p>
      <p>"This was truly a remarkable event in both the wide assortment of items and the record prices realized for so many of them," said Ken Goldin, founder of Goldin Auctions</p>
      <p>In total, 1,500 lots generated $4.3 million in sales, with five pieces of memorabilia closing for more than $100,000.</p>
      <p>Williams initially gave her smashed racket to ball boy Justin Arrington-Holmes, who sold it to a dealer in Manhattan for $500 earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/sports/tennis/serena-williams-racket-auction.html">according to the New York Times</a>.</p>
      <p>"Looking back I wish I'd had someone help me with the process," said Holmes. "I was not familiar with how any of this works. I just wanted to get rid of it."</p>
      <p>Other items that went under the hammer at Goldin Auctions include a canceled check signed by Michael Jordan, which sold for $12,300, and a used Jerry Rice 49ers jerseys from 1995, which fetched $27,060.</p>
