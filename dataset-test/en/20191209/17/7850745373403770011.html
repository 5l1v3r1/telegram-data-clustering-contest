      <h1>Nigerian arrested for confining 3 female MUBS students</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:18:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">URN</a></address>
      <p>A Nigerian national and KCCA FC striker, John Odemwegu, 25, has been arrested on allegations of holding hostage three female students of Makerere University Business School (MUBS) for over 10 hours.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Fred Enanga, says on Saturday, the suspect invited his girlfriend, Grace Nakibuuka, whom he met five days ago to his home in Mutungo, Nakawa Division, in Kampala. </p>
      <p>She reportedly came along with two other female friends identified as Margret Namutebi and Joan Namirembe. Enanga said at around 9 pm, the students asked Odemwegu, to leave but he insisted that they stay around. He reportedly confiscated their mobile phones and at around 10 pm, he locked them inside the house and went to an unknown place.</p>
      <p>However, one of the girls had an extra phone, which she used to inform her other colleagues what had befallen them at around midnight. The students rushed to Kinawataka police station and filed a case explaining how their colleagues were being held captive by a man. </p>
      <p>Kinawataka police sent a message to Jinja Road policing division, which immediately launched a hunt for the students throughout the entire night of Saturday.Odemwegu returned at around 7 am on Sunday morning and released the trio. Enanga said since police was already on the hunt, it traced the phones once they were returned to the students and switched on. </p>
      <p>Police collaborating with the victims, located the suspect’s home leading to his arrest for unlawful confinement. Odemwegu, according to Enanga, said he hadn’t abducted the students but had kept them in his house for their own safety as he feared that they could be hurt by thugs in the area if he had allowed them to move alone during night hours.</p>
      <p>Police has cautioned young adults to be very careful, saying the dating landscape has changed nowadays because anything evil can happen at any time. Nakibuuka, Namirembe and Namutebi have already recorded statements. Early this year, two Congolese female students were found dead and locked inside a rented house at Kakeeka in Mengo, Rubaga Division, in Kampala. </p>
      <p>They were allegedly killed by their fellow Congolese male student accusing one of them of cheating on him.</p>
