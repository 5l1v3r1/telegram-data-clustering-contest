      <h1>Big claim from France that PSG could swoop for Liverpool star</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:20:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>This week’s edition of <a href="http://francefootball.fr/">France Football</a> has a special feature on potential PSG transfers. It’s mostly about players who could leave the club and there’s nothing hugely dramatic.</p>
      <p>There’s also a small section on potential incomings, and that’s where Sadio Mane gets a mention.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the last summer transfer window the Liverpool star was linked to Real Madrid a couple of times, and it’s possible that PSG will take that role ahead of future markets.</p>
      <p>France Football report Mane’s name is becoming more popular with those in charge at PSG, especially in the scenario that Neymar leaves the Ligue 1 champions.</p>
      <p>Should the Brazilian leave then the Liverpool player is believed to be the ‘perfect’ candidate to replace him.</p>

      <p>There’s no explanation about what Mane himself or the Reds would think about a potential Anfield exit. Unless the player pushed for a transfer it’s unlikely Jurgen Klopp would be happy to see the back of him.</p>
      <p>Mane’s contract runs until the end of June 2023.</p>
