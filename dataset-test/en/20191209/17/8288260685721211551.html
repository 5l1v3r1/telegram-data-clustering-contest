      <p>The eight-year-old son of a man with two Guinness World Records is claiming one himself after finding the biggest ever - HULA HOOP crisp.</p>
      <p>Stunned Tom McGrath has told of his delight after finding the super-sized three and a half inch snack.</p>
      <p>He now hopes it will make it into the Guinness Book of World Records - his dad Fergal is already in there with two driving world records.</p>
      <p>Tom discovered the huge snack when his mum Sarah, 48, gave him crisps after school.</p>
      <p>Tom, of Swindon, Wilts, said: “When I saw it, I was quite shocked and then I showed my mum and my dad and they were really surprised.</p>
      <p>“I was tempted to eat it but it’s lucky that I didn’t because then it would have been gone for good.”</p>

      <p>Two hours after discovering it he rushed to football practice to tell his friend about the crisp and he couldn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>And this isn’t the first time Tom has discovered a funny looking Hula Hoop.</p>
      <p>Tom, who goes to Croft Primary, said: “I’ve seen some before that were funny shapes and different sizes.</p>
      <p>"You can get some quite often that are double the size they should be but they’ve never been as big as this one.”</p>

      <p>His dad Fergal, 48, thinks it could be a world record and described it as ‘a whopper’.</p>
      <p>Fergal said: “Guinness might be interested, but KP actually make them so I will drop them an email too and maybe we will hear back from them.”</p>
      <p>For now Tom is keeping it in a sealed bag to see if it's a record. If not, he might sell it on Ebay.</p>
      <p>Fergal said: “We were thinking crazy things like it could be a Guinness World Record.</p>
      <p>''I’ve got two Guinness World Records and so I emailed the guys I know to see if it really is.”</p>

      <p>He secured one for driving around Europe in a Honda Civic doing 100 miles per gallon.</p>
      <p>The second was in a Honda Jazz travelling 840 miles at 95 miles per gallon.</p>
      <p>Hula Hoops are produced by KP, a business founded in1853 by Charles Kenyon but started making crisps in the 1940s.</p>
      <p>The popular snack launched in 1973.</p>
