      <p>PHOENIX â€” A teen has been arrested, accused of firing shots outside a private police and fire academy in Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Phoenix police report that on December 5, they arrested a 17-year-old male after a short foot pursuit near his home at 16th and Washington streets.</p>
      <p>The suspect is accused of firing several shots outside the Franklin Police and Fire Academy at 16th Avenue and McDowell Road on November 26. On that day, police say, a majority of the 300 students were leaving the campus when the shots were fired. Many fled back to the school while others sought shelter in nearby homes.</p>
      <p>A witness reportedly told police that a dark-colored Volkswagen sped by the school, and he yelled at the driver to slow down. The car then came back and argued with the witness, pointed a gun at him and fired several shots in the air before speeding away. Another witness got a photo of the license plate.</p>
      <p>Court records show that police were able to identify the suspect driving the car, and several witnesses reportedly told police he was the shooter.</p>
      <p>Police located and arrested the suspect several days later.</p>
      <p>He has been charged in juvenile court on various charges, including aggravated assault and endangerment.</p>
