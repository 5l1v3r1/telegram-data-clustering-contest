      <p>Frank Lampard has challenged his young Chelsea players to “make a mark” ahead of their crucial Champions League match against Lille on Tuesday after a series of poor results took the shine off their season.</p>
      <p>Chelsea must beat the French side at Stamford Bridge to ensure safe passage to the knockout stages, with manager Lampard expecting far sharper focus than his players showed during the 3-1 weekend defeat to Everton.</p>
      <p>He admitted Chelsea’s recent poor form — just one win in five games — was his first big challenge as Blues boss and wants his players to embrace the pressure of this week’s must-win clash.</p>
      <p>“It is a test for us and it was always going to come,” Lampard said during his pre-match press conference on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The way we are, the nature of the Premier League, this was never going to be plain sailing, invincible season from our point of view. Teams need this test.</p>
      <p>“Big games like this, they are crucial for the players. You can be defined as an individual and a group by success.”</p>
      <p>Lampard, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012, said he had been fortunate to have enjoyed many big nights as a player.</p>
      <p>“So these are big opportunities now for the team, particularly the young boys when it’s quite new to them, to make a mark,” he said. “So I think it’s good, I like the pressure of this game being knockout.</p>
      <p>“If we’re going to do anything good here, we’re going to have to have lots of these nights.”</p>
      <p>Lampard said his side’s poor run had not yet altered his view on January recruitment plans after the club’s FIFA transfer ban had been lifted.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t say my mind is set on anything to be changed,” said Lampard, whose side are fourth in the Premier League despite their wobble.</p>
      <p>“But you do learn from your players in tough times, not just in terms of what they do on the pitch but how their personality is.</p>
      <p>“That was the disappointing thing at Everton. It wasn’t just that we were slightly off — I didn’t like that there were individual contact moments across the game that we lost. Because that’s a personality thing as much as anything else.”</p>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger is fit for just his second appearance of the season following groin trouble, with the Germany centre-back likely to step into the Blues’ defence.</p>
      <p>Lampard believes Rudiger can make an instant impact, with the 26-year-old’s return proving timely as Fikayo Tomori misses out due to a minor hip issue.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good defender, it’s good to have him back and he’s training really well,” said Lampard, of Rudiger.</p>
      <p>“He has got a lot of his fitness work done since the injury’s healed.</p>
      <p>“People may be overlooked the fact that we were missing a number of big players at the start of the season. Rudi is just back, so let’s see what he can add to us now.”</p>
