        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-new-office-in-nyc-2019-12">Amazon is opening a new office in New York City’s Hudson Yards</a> neighborhood, the company announced on Friday.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/hudson-yards">Hudson Yards</a>, the $25 billion megadevelopment that opened in March 2019, is now <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-nyc-neighborhood-hudson-yards-2019-10">the most expensive neighborhood in New York City</a>, with a median sales price of nearly $5 million.</li>
        <li>In the neighborhood’s luxury residential skyscrapers like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fifteen-hudson-yards-nyc-luxury-building-photos-amenities-pool-apartment-2019-2">15 Hudson Yards</a> and 35 Hudson Yards, <a href="https://streeteasy.com/building/15-hudson-yards">current condo listings range from $2.6 million</a> to <a href="https://streeteasy.com/building/35-hudson-yards-manhattan">$59 million.</a></li>
        <li>Hudson Yards was financed with at least $1.2 billion through EB-5, an investor visa program intended to combat urban poverty, according to <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/04/hudson-yards-financing-eb5-investor-visa-program-immigration/586897/">a recent report from CityLab.</a></li>
        <li>Attractions at Hudson Yards include <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hudson-yards-mall-shops-restaurants-new-york-city-photos-2019-3">The Shops and Restaurants at Hudson Yards</a>, a luxury shopping center with stores like Louis Vuitton and Dior, as well as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-vessel-sculpture-hudson-yards-views-photos-2019-3">Vessel, a 150-foot tall, climbable sculpture</a> that cost $200 million to build.</li>
        <li>I got to spend the day at Hudson Yards for its grand opening. Here’s what it looks like, from the $200 million climbable sculpture to the 7-story luxury shopping center.</li>

      <p>Hudson Yards, New York City’s new $25 billion megadevelopment, is now <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-nyc-neighborhood-hudson-yards-2019-10">the city’s most expensive neighborhood</a>, with a median sales price of nearly $5 million.</p>
      <p>And it will soon be home to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-new-office-in-nyc-2019-12">a new Amazon office that will employee 1,500 people</a>, the company announced Friday.</p>
      <p>Hudson Yards is the most expensive real-estate development in US history – but <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/04/hudson-yards-financing-eb5-investor-visa-program-immigration/586897/">reporting from CityLab shows</a> that it got more than $1.2 billion in financing from EB-5, an investor visa program intended to combat urban poverty.</p>
      <p>“This program enables immigrants to secure visas in exchange for real estate investments,” wrote Kriston Capps for CityLab.</p>
      <p>“EB-5 is supposed to be a way to jumpstart investment in remote rural areas, or distressed urban ones,” Capps continued. Because the Hudson Yards area does not qualify as a distressed urban area, he continued, The Related Companies – the developer behind Hudson Yards – managed to link the boundaries of Hudson Yards to Harlem, where the employment rate is, in parts, low enough to qualify as a distressed urban area.</p>
      <p>“By utilizing the EB-5 program we were able to finance the critical infrastructure for the project, the platform, where traditional financing is all but non-existent in the post-recession, post Dodd-Frank marketplace,” a spokesperson for Hudson Yards told Business Insider.</p>

      <p>“This capital, which comes at no cost to the American taxpayers, was the catalyst for the Hudson Yards project and allowed us to immediately create thousands of jobs all over the city,” the spokesperson continued.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson claimed that Hudson Yards would provide “direct benefits to areas of high unemployment” despite being some 70 city blocks and nearly 5 miles from the southern end of Harlem, where the actual high unemployment exists.</p>
      <p>The public can now visit the brand-new neighborhood on Manhattan’s West Side, which includes luxurious residential towers, a luxury shopping center with stores like Louis Vuitton and Dior, and a $200 million, 150-foot tall climbable sculpture called the Vessel.</p>
