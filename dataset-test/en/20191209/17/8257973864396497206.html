      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Walmart issued an apology for a Christmas sweater on the store's Canadian website that featured a reference to doing illicit drugs.</p>
      <p>The sweater, which was formerly available from a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, featured <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Santa_Claus/?tps=1">Santa Claus</a> with <a href="https://abc7.com/fashion/walmart-apologizes-for-sweater-showing-santa-with-cocaine/5741748/">lines of what the product description</a> called "quality, grade A, Colombian snow," but online observers agreed was a reference to cocaine.</p>
      <p>"These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart's values and have no place on our website," Walmart said in a statement <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6267927/walmart-canada-christmas-sweaters-cocaine/">to Global News.</a> "We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologize for any unintended offense this may have caused."</p>
      <p>The listing, which has now been removed, was credited to clothing company FUN Wear.</p>
