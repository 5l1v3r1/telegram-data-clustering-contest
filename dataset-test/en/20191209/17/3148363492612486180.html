      <h1>Gaetz Slams Dems’ Call for Impeachment Hearing Recess to Talk to Press</h1>

      <p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) slammed Democrats’ call for a recess in the middle of the House Judiciary Committee’s second impeachment inquiry hearing on Monday, asserting it was so that they could hold a press conference.</p>
      <p>As Democrat counsel Daniel Goldman was finishing his testimony, Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) made a motion for a hearing recess.</p>
      <p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) declared it a “privileged motion” that was not debatable.</p>
      <p>Democrats voted to go to recess, while all Republicans voted to continue the hearing and go to the Republican counsel.</p>
      <p>Gaetz, a member of the Judiciary Committee, shouted, “No, because this is so that they can have a press conference before Mr. Castor gets the chance to offer rebuttal. Nobody asked for this break Mr. Chairman.”</p>
      <p>Nadler gaveled Gaetz down, ordering him to suspend.</p>
      <p>Nadler would not respond to a Republican question on how long the recess would last.</p>
      <p>“It’s until they’re done with their press conference,” Gaetz offered.</p>
