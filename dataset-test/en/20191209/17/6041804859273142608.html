      <p>After a bumper mass number to open the musical account, team <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/mahesh-babu-sarileru-neekevvaru-at-the-top-of-the-game/">Sarileru Neekevvaru </a>is coming with melody. The song ‘Suryudivo Chandrudivo’ is out now.</p>
      <p>It won’t take any time to realise that ‘Suryudivo Chandrudivo’ is typical Devi Sri Prasad situational melody. It is not the type that gets a pleasant listening for the fans or music lovers. It is made to carry the narrative forward visually.</p>
      <p>Among the two, neither are long term prospects, but the first single ‘Mind Block’ provides a fan-pleasing effect. The lyrics are neat on the second one and it is a minor relief.</p>
      <p>On-screen, the visuals seem impressive from the lyrical video. Cameraman Rathnavelu seems to have stored a visual feast for the big screen. Only the placement needs to be taken care of and we are sure Anil Ravipudi would be able to get that right.</p>
      <p>For those of you who are still waiting for the ‘big mass’ number, there are two more coming up. They are said to be a teasing fun single and an item song. We hope the best is saved for the last.</p>
      <p>Listen to the song below. Sarileru Neekevvaru stars Mahesh Babu and Rashmika Mandanna in the lead roles. Anil Ravipudi directs the mass entertainer which will hit the screens worldwide on January 10th 2020.</p>
