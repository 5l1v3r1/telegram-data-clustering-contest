      <p>The former head of Russia’s anti-doping agency, who fled Moscow after turning whistleblower, on Monday welcomed a four-year ban from major sporting events imposed on his country.</p>
      <p>“Finally, fraud, lies and falsifications of unspeakable proportions have been punished in full swing,” said Grigory Rodchenkov in a statement.</p>

      <p>Rodchenkov, who lives in the US under a witness protection program after accusing Russia of widespread doping activities, warned however that for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) “there is more to do.”</p>
      <p>He said those involved in the doping of athletes “should be punished retroactively.”</p>
