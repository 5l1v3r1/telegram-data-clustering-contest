      <p>He also made sleazy and inappropriate comments to eight youngsters, including asking if any wanted to be his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>McMullen’s wife was acting head teacher during some of the incidents.</p>
      <p>Glasgow Sheriff Court heard he told a 16-year-old girl in front of her class: “I would pay 20 quid to look up your skirt,” pretended to spank another girl and pinned a third girl against a wall.</p>
      <p>All his victims were upset and some broke into tears because of his conduct.</p>
      <p>The court heard that McMullen retired in 2007, before returning to work in 2014.</p>
      <p>His lawyer Nicholas Nimmo claimed that McMullen, who started his career as a teacher in 1972, had adapted his teaching style to the modern world.</p>
      <p>Mr Nimmo added: “He was trying to build a rapport and get street credibility.</p>
      <p>“He was using the language that the pupils were using in the classroom.</p>

      <p>“Part of his way of dealing with it was by the way of humour.”</p>
      <p>McMullen suggested to another girl that she should sit on his knee which made her feel “extremely uncomfortable.”</p>
      <p>He cornered a 12-year-old girl in a corridor and at one point touched her hip with his left hand to restrain her.</p>
      <p>In a police interview, the girl said: “I felt petrified as teachers don’t put their hands on me.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to move away from the wall and he wouldn’t let me move at all and that’s when I started crying as I got a fright and I froze.”</p>
      <p>A support teacher said McMullen made other inappropriate comments to girls such as “Who wants to be my girlfriend?”</p>
      <p>A 14-year-old was asked by McMullen to take off her shirt in one of his maths classes.</p>
      <p>The girl said she was “embarrassed and humiliated” by McMullen’s comment.</p>
      <p>Earlier that year, the same girl sprayed Victoria’s Secret perfume in one of McMullen’s classes.</p>
      <blockquote>I felt petrified as teachers don’t put their hands on me. I wanted to move away from the wall and he wouldn’t let me move at all and that’s when I started crying as I got a fright and I froze.”</blockquote>
      <p>He asked her if she also bought her underwear from Victoria’s Secret.</p>
      <p>In August last year, a 15-year-old female student said McMullen came up behind her and squeezed her.</p>
      <p>The court heard McMullen made other comments such as “You fancy me” and then asked a girl who dropped her homework if it was a “love letter for me?”</p>
      <p>There were several complaints made to the school by the pupils and parents.</p>
      <p>McMullen apologised and told them that he felt “unwell” and took a few days off work before resigning.</p>
      <p>Parents were “dissatisfied” with the way the complaints were dealt with by school staff.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alan Findlay deferred sentence on McMullen for reports until January next year.</p>
      <p>McMullen, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, was put on the sex offenders register meantime.</p>
      <p>After the hearing, the one of the victim's parents hailed the ruling as a "victory for the kids."</p>
      <p>They added: "He he has ruined a lot of children's lives - it’s a position of trust that he was in.</p>
      <p>"You send your kids away to school thinking they are going to be safe.”</p>
