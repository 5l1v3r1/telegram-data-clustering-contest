      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/jeremy_corbyn/index.html"><b>Jeremy Corbyn</b></a> desperately tried to get his campaign back on track today with a vicious attack on <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/donald_trump/index.html"><b>Donald Trump</b></a> as the Labour leader looked to repeat the party's 2017 general election surge.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn addressed a mass rally in Bristol this afternoon and claimed it was only Labour that could stop the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/nhs/index.html"><b>NHS</b></a> being sold off to the US in a post-<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/brexit/index.html"><b>Brexit</b></a> trade deal. </p>
      <p>He claimed that a Tory-negotiated deal with Mr Trump would 'put all of our public services at risk' as he continued to put the health service at the centre of his bid for Number 10. </p>
      <p>Labour will be hoping that the rally - similar to those held during the 2017 campaign - will lead to a spike in support for the party. </p>
      <p>The race two years ago saw Mr Corbyn win an unexpected 40 per cent of the vote, only just behind the Tories' 42 per cent. </p>
      <p>But a new opinion poll published today suggests Labour is running out of time to reverse its fortunes with polling day now just three days away. </p>
      <p>The ICM Research puts the Tories six points ahead of Labour - one of the narrowest margins of any poll during the campaign but still enough to comfortably make the Conservatives the biggest party if the results are replicated at the ballot box on Thursday. </p>

        <figcaption>Mr Corbyn today repeated his claim that Donald Trump wants access to the NHS as part of any trade deal - something the US President, pictured in Florida on Saturday, has long denied</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has repeatedly claimed during the election campaign that the Tories want to sell off the NHS to the US as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. </p>
      <p>Mr Trump has insisted he has no interest in gaining access to the NHS and the Tories have fiercely rejected Mr Corbyn's claims.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader repeated the accusation at today's rally and went even further as he claimed the Conservatives would 'put all of our public services at risk' in a trade deal.</p>
      <p>He also referred to a widely-publicised photograph of a sick four-year-old boy who was forced to lie on a hospital floor as he waited for treatment. </p>
      <p>He said: 'With Labour you will get investment, you will get that sense of security for the future. </p>
      <p>'And you will get the protection of our National Health Service. When the Daily Mirror today shows this picture... of a four year old boy suffering from pneumonia being treated on the floor of a hospital and people ask questions about this and I simply say this, the Tories have had nine years to fund our NHS properly. </p>
      <p>'It is time to bring their regime to an end and elect a Labour government that is determined to fund our NHS properly. </p>
      <p>'But there is another threat to the NHS. A very big threat to the NHS and that is the secret talks that have gone on for two years between the Tory government and the United States administration.' </p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn claimed that Mr Johnson 'really wants a No Deal Brexit straight into the arms of Donald Trump and a trade deal with them'. </p>
      <p>'It is very clear to me that trade deal with the United States would put all of our public services at risk, into the hands of global corporations and they would open up what they gently call our health market,' he told the Labour faithful. </p>
      <p>'Well, I have got news for them. There is no health market. We shut that down in 1948 when we established the National Health Service.'    </p>
      <p>The new ICM Research survey, conducted between December 6-9, puts the Tories on 42 per cent and Labour on 36 per cent overall. </p>
