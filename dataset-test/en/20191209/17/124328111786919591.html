      <p>A boy in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/china/index.html"><b>China</b></a> has escaped serious injuries after being blown into the air and flung 360 degrees by the force of an exploding sewer. </p>
      <p>The blast took place after the child threw a lit match into a manhole, igniting trapped methane, according to reports. </p>
      <p>The boy, who remains unidentified, didn't suffer major injuries.</p>

      <p>The accident occurred on November 29 in a residential complex in Zhuozhou, a prefecture-level city in northern China's Hebei Province, reported <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E4GGAOox5RNvD49fGDIzuQ"><b>Zhuozhou Media Convergence</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage released by the local news group shows the boy walking towards the manhole with a playmate. </p>
      <p>It then shows him crouching down and sticking an object into the metal cover. </p>
      <p>But as soon as he stands upright, he is launched into the air by the force of an explosion under his feet. </p>
      <p>The blast is so powerful the boy is propelled to spin 360 degrees in midair and then lands on the ground hard.</p>

        <figcaption>He manages to stand up on his own and limps for a few steps before sitting down to rest</figcaption>

      <p>The manhole cover, which was catapulted into the air, smashes onto the pavement a few metres away from the two children.</p>
      <p>The clip then captures the boy struggling to stand up. </p>
      <p>He is seen limping for a few steps before having to sit down by the pavement to rest further.</p>
      <p>He eventually walks away from the scene by himself.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness told Zhuozhou Media Convergence that the manhole cover was largely destroyed in the explosion and the boy's face was hit by loose stones and sustained bleeding. </p>
      <p>Another local resident said he could hear the blast well from his home, which was nine storeys up.</p>
      <p>Similar accidents are common in China during winter, especially in the leading up to the Chinese New Year. </p>
      <p>In January this year, a young boy in Chifeng City in China's Inner Mongolia cheated death after putting lit fireworks through a manhole cover on a street, leading to a huge blast.  </p>
