      <h1>'My job is to defend my client': Giuliani teases his own report on Ukraine findings</h1>

      <p>President Trump’s personal attorney claimed he would have a report on his own findings in the Ukraine saga ready by the end of the week.</p>
      <p>Rudy Giuliani made a surprise visit to Kyiv last week as Democrats moved forward in drafting articles of impeachment against Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“I could care less at this point about the 2020 election. My job is to defend my client. That’s why I was there now. I’ve gone there before. I interviewed about 20 witnesses way back last January, February, and March. I thought I had made an overwhelming case of bribery on the part of [former vice president Joe] Biden,” Giuliani told <i>War Room</i>, a radio show hosted by former White House strategist Steve Bannon.</p>
      <p>Giuliani <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-he-spoke-with-ukrainians-about-biden-today">said he has tried to bring several Ukrainian officials</a> to the United States to testify in favor of the allegations that Joe Biden was engaged in bribery while his son Hunter Biden was on the board for a Ukrainian gas company. Trump’s personal lawyer said he has the documents to prove his case.</p>
      <p>“I was going to do an outline of it and try to present it at the convenience of the Republicans in Congress and the attorney general at the end of this week. I should probably have it ready on Wednesday or Thursday. I don’t know exactly when it will be made public. But it should be ready by then. I worked on it all weekend,” he said Monday.</p>

      <p>Giuliani had long teased a counter-report when special counsel Robert Mueller was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, but the attorney never followed through with his own report on Mueller’s findings.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-hear-hes-found-plenty-trump-says-giuliani-will-give-report-on-ukraine-findings-to-congress">told reporters Saturday</a> that he had not been briefed on Giuliani’s findings, but he heard his lawyer “found plenty.”</p>
      <p>Attorney General William Barr counseled Trump that Giuliani has become a liability for his administration, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-giulianis-dual-roles-power-broker-for-hire-and-shadow-foreign-policy-adviser/2019/12/08/f9ab9c4c-1773-11ea-9110-3b34ce1d92b1_story.html">the <i>Washington Post</i> reported</a> Sunday. In one conversation, Barr told Trump that he was not being well-served by Giuliani.</p>
