      <p>Former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> defender Steven Caldwell believes Steve Bruce has taken the Magpies to the 'next level'.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old endured a turbulent start to life on Tyneside, inheriting the hotseat following the acrimonious departure of Rafa Benitez.</p>
      <p>Attendances at St James' Park dwindled as disenchanted supporters voted with their feet to express their fury at Mike Ashley's continued ownership.</p>
      <p>United endured a difficult opening to the Premier League campaign, with an early defeat at Norwich City and the thrashing by Leicester City seemingly confirming many observers' early predictions that the club was destined for a relegation dogfight.</p>
      <p>But a recent upturn in form has seen the Magpies soar into 10th in the table, with a run of four victories in six matches opening up a seven-point cushion over the bottom three.</p>

      <p>Recent wins over Sheffield United and Southampton have seen Bruce's side ground out positive results despite seeing far less of the ball.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Love Sport Radio, former Magpies' defender Steven Caldwell does not believe United have been 'lucky' in their recent victories.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old believes Bruce's trust in his players has been rewarded, and that the former Aston Villa and Sunderland boss has built upon Benitez's legacy in the North East.</p>
      <p>Caldwell said: "I don't think Newcastle have got lucky. They've done a great job, playing some good football - I think it's Rafa Benitez's Newcastle with a little added touch of Steve Bruce, and I think they're better for that, I really do.</p>
      <p>"I think the credit has to be given to Steve Bruce - he's doing a great job. It's the trust that he's shown in players, the likes of-Saint Maximin and Miguel Almiron where there was a lack of productivity there, but they were giving the team so much.</p>

      <p>"Steve Bruce stuck with them, he was confident in them,Â he went for the arm around the shoulder to encourage them, and it's worked. Saint-Maximin's been brilliant, Almiron got his first assist, and they're flying.</p>
      <p>"The man management skills of Steve Bruce cannot be overstated. He's really taken Newcastle on to the next level with his skills."</p>
