      <h1>Why Making ‘Birds of Prey’ R-Rated Was “Liberating,” According to Margot Robbie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:30:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>Even as superhero movies became more and more prominent and popular, the idea of an R-rated superhero flick seemed impossible. These were movies marketed to the widest possible audience, after all. But little by little, R-rated comic book adaptations have been trickling in. <i>Deadpool</i> was a smash-hit, followed by <i>Logan</i>, which earned itself an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. And this year, <i>Joker</i> defied all expectations and raked in a billion dollars. Now, <b><i>Birds of Prey</i></b>, a semi-sequel to <i>Suicide Squad</i>, might follow suit. While no<i> Birds of Prey</i> rating has been awarded to the film yet, the production didn’t censor itself. And according to star <b>Margot Robbie</b>, that was liberating.</p>
      <p>While visiting the set of <i>Birds of Prey</i>, our own Peter Sciretta noticed some very adult language being tossed around by the actors during filming. While nothing is finalized yet, it certainly seems like an R-rating is in the cards for the upcoming DC movie. While talking with Margot Robbie, who plays Harley Quinn in the film, the question of a potential R-rating came up, and how it felt to let Harley go wild.</p>
      <p>“I did feel like I had to censor myself a lot, obviously to suit a PG rating,” Robbie said, referring to her work on <i>Suicide Squad</i>. “And a lot of the characters that exist in the DC world, to be honest, are quite dark. And a lot of them, Huntress for example, have serious childhood trauma, have serious mental illnesses like Harley. But I felt like sometimes you can’t really go as deep with those things if you have to censor yourself. And I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be liberating if we didn’t have to worry about that?’ and really go for it, and then later in the edit kind of find where the tone of movie lies.”</p>
      <p>Robbie’s comment about finding the right tone for the movie in the edit implies that the door is still open to a potential PG-13 movie. The film could always be trimmed to ensure that tamer rating, or DC could go all-out and let the R-rating stand. For now – especially in the wake of the success of <i>Joker</i> – it’s safe to assume that <i>Birds of Prey </i>will have an R-rating.</p>
      <p>Back in 2018, Robbie stated that she pitched the film to WB with an R-rating in mind. “I pitched the idea of an R-rated girl gang film including Harley, because I was like, ‘Harley needs friends,'” Robbie <a href="https://collider.com/harley-quinn-movie-r-rated-margot-robbie/#images">said</a>. “Harley loves interacting with people, so don’t ever make her do a standalone film. She’s got to be with other people, it should be a girl gang. I wasn’t seeing enough girl gangs on screen, especially in the action space. So that was always a big part of it.”</p>
      <p><i>Birds of Prey</i> opens <b>February 7, 2020</b>.</p>
