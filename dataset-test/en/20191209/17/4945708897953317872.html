      <h1>A more realistic Bitmoji? Snapchat is rolling out a tool called Cameo that uses deepfake technology</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:38:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">Dalvin Brown, Usa Today</a></address>
      <p>SnapChat is adding a feature that basically allows you to deepfake yourself into a video or GIF for fun.</p>
      <p>The feature was first spotted by Snapchat users in France who received a test version of the tool over the weekend. The latest addition to the app is called Cameo, Snapchat said in a press release Monday.</p>
      <p>"With Cameos, you become the star of short, looping videos that you can customize with your own face," Snapchat said. "They're great for striking up new conversations or making responses to your friends personal, dynamic and fun."</p>
      <p>Based on screen captures posted by people on Twitter, Cameo uses your selfie to plaster your face on a digitized body. The feature has a similar look and application to Bitmoji, except more realistic. It's rolling out globally on Dec.18 with over 150 variations to choose from.</p>
      <p>Cameo will be embedded in the Chat sticker bar once the new feature is live in the U.S. You get to choose the body you'd like for your face to appear on, and Snapchat will use AI to manipulate your face into displaying different emotions and expressions.</p>
      <p>If your friends set up Cameo, you'll see options that feature the two of you together. And, many can include your own text.</p>
      <p>Deepfake technology would be a relatively new frontier for the app, though it would further differentiate Snapchat from its rivals Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. The technology, which has been used to transpose celebrities into pornographic videos, has come under criticism because it could be used to maliciously produce fake political videos.</p>
      <p>Still, Snapchat has been hard at work developing new filters and add-ons to keep the platform interesting for teens and young adults who are constantly on the hunt for new, creative ways to interact with peers.</p>
      <p>In November, Snapchat picked up where the wildly popular Face App left off by rolling out a tool that tries to show you what you look like at every phase of life. It's called Time Machine, and it includes a slider you can drag across your screen to watch the years add up.</p>
