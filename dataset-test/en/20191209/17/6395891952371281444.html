      <p>It will be called the Cold Moon and will be the last one of 2019, <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/space-astronomy/full-cold-moon-december-2019">Travel and Leisure reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It also is called the Long Night’s Moon and the Moon Before Yule.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/full-moon-december-2019-100914">According to the Farmers Almanac</a>, the number 12 has some significance in numerology. It’s at the end of the spectrum and allows the wrap-up of events before moving on.</p>
      <p>In Chinese numerology, the number represents yin and yang. One is a yang number that is ruled by the sun. Two is a yin ruled by the Moon, <a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/full-moon-december-2019-100914">according to the almanac</a>.</p>
      <p>The full moon will be followed by the Geminid Meteor Showers, <a href="https://www.space.com/34921-geminid-meteor-shower-guide.html">according to Space.com</a>.</p>
      <p>The peak is Dec. 13 but could be seen after peak times over the next few days. About 20 to 30 meteors an hour may be visible due to the brightness of the moon. Normally they peak at 2 a.m. local time but can be seen as early as 9 p.m.</p>
