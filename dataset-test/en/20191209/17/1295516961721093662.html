      <p>As expected,<i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/birds-of-prey-film/"> Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</a> </i>will explore the mind of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, according to director Cathy Yan and producer Sue Kroll.</p>
      <p>Yan and Kroll recently spoke with <a href="https://screenrant.com/birds-prey-movie-harley-quinn-character-change-dceu/"><i>Screen Rant</i></a> about the emotional evolution Quinn will go on through in the film. "I think there's such a duality in Harley Quinn, even in just the blue and the pink, and Dr. Harleen Quinzel versus Harley Quinn," commented Yan. "Both sides of her are there, and she’s still very much the smart doctor that she once was."</p>

      <p>Yan went on to mention the other side of Harley's persona, including how she has low self-esteem and can be easily manipulated. "So I think this is a great opportunity to explore the woman behind 'Harley Quinn,' and explore that duality, and dive deeper into her psyche," she continued.</p>
      <p>Kroll added that the portrayal of Harley Quinn's morality in the film is "complex." "She comes away as somebody who's much more complicated rather than sort of singular… ‘nuts,’" said Kroll.</p>
