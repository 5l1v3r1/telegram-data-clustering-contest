      <h1>Pensacola hit with cyberattack day after deadly Naval base shooting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:43:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Pascus</a></address>
      <p>The city of Pensacola, Florida, was hit with a cyberattack just one day after a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/08/second-victim-named-in-deadly-pensacola-shooting-was-also-a-navy-trainee/">deadly shooting at the Naval base there</a> — though it’s unclear if the events are connected, officials said.</p>
      <p>Mayor Grover Robinson said Monday that almost all computer systems and communication in City Hall, including phone lines and email, are not working due to the attack.</p>
      <p>According to Florida Today, city officials said the cyberattack began at 1:45 a.m. on Saturday morning and has continued since then.</p>
      <p>The online payment systems for the city’s sanitation department and those at Pensacola Energy are not currently working, but the police and fire departments have not been affected.</p>
      <p>It began a day after a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/07/pensacola-shooter-hosted-dinner-party-to-watch-mass-shooting-videos-report/">visiting Saudi airman</a> opened fire on the Pensacola Naval Air Station — killing three before he was gunned down by police.</p>
      <p>National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said the shooting “<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/08/pensacola-navy-base-shooting-presumed-to-be-terror-attack-fbi/">appears to be a terrorist attack</a>.”</p>

      <p>The gunman, Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was a member of the Saudi Air Force and a student naval flight officer who was in the United States for aviation training.</p>
      <p>Robinson said on Monday that it is unclear if the cyberattack in Pensacola is in any way connected with the shooting.</p>
      <p>Robinson said the city is currently working with the FBI to resolve the issue.</p>
