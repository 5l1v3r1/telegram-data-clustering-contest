      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tinashe/profile">Tinashe</a> dropped off her latest album <i>Songs For You </i>just last month that came equipped with 15 songs and features by 6LACK and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/g-eazy/profile">G-Eazy</a>. The offering was an independent release by Tinashe following her drop from RCA records and seemingly was a bit of a redemption feeling as she managed her own direction and meaning behind her release.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old singer has now followed up with more love on her project since dropping off an official video for the album's fifth song, "Save Room For Us." The over three-minute video sees Tinashe hitting the streets of Tokyo with a dance crew, busting out moves in various locations. Tinashe revealed on Instagram that "Save Room For Us" has been the most-streamed song on her album so far so it only makes sense for it to be the first to get a visual offering.</p>
