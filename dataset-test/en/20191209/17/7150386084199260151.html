      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> The<a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/jammu-and-kashmir-88-terror-incidents-recorded-in-valley-after-article-370-revocation-infiltration-attempts-rise-3865725/"> Supreme Court</a> on Tuesday will hear a bunch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/manmohan-slams-centre-for-revoking-article-370-says-rajya-sabha-should-have-been-consulted-3848307/">revocation of Article 370</a> which had accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>A five-judge bench, headed by Justice NV Ramana, and comprising Justices S K Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant will hear the pleas which were filed by National Conference, Sajjad Lone-led J&amp;K Peoples Conference and CPI (M) leader Mohd Yousuf Tarigami.</p>
      <p>On December 5, the apex court agreed to hear an application seeking the live streaming, recording or transcription of proceedings on the pleas challenging abrogation of Article 370.</p>
      <p>The development comes after the top court had in November said it would hear all the pleas related to Article 370.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the top court had put restrictions on hearing the plea challenging the revocation of Article 370. The top court had also said that it would hear only two pleas.</p>
      <p>Apart from two pleas, a number of other pleas have also been pending at the top court which were filed by bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal,  students leader Shehla Rashid, and there was another plea filed by a group of former bureaucrats and defence officers challenging the Centre’s decision.</p>
