      <p>The House Judiciary Committee received a detailed summing up of the impeachment case against President Donald Trump as both sides of politics began to feel the pressure.</p>
      <p>The President continued to tweet his disgust with the proceedings.</p>
      <p>The House Judiciary Committee received a detailed summing up of the impeachment case against President Donald Trump as Democrats prepare formal charges against him.</p>
      <p>But the hearing was interrupted by a protester - later identified as website talk show host Owen Shroyer - shouting “We voted for Donald Trump!” and decrying Democrats as the ones committing “treason.”</p>

      <p>Shroyer, who hosts the Infowars talk show the War Room, was escorted from the House hearing room by Capitol Police, but not before he recorded his outburst and posted it to twitter.</p>
      <p>“Jerry Nadler (Democrat committee chairman) and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country, and you can kick me out but he’s the one committing crimes — you are, Jerry Nadler,” the heckler said.</p>

      <p>“You’re the one committing treason. America’s done with this. America’s sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party.</p>
      <p>“Americans are sick of your impeachment scam. They’re sick of the Democrat treason. We know who committed the crimes, and it wasn’t Trump. Trump is innocent,” Shroyer says on his way out of the room.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Republicans fumed when Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee whose 300-page report provides the foundation for articles of impeachment, stayed true to his word and refused to appear before the committee yesterday.</p>

      <p>This is despite the fact that Schiff’s 300-page report provides the foundation for articles of impeachment.</p>
      <p>The House Judiciary Committee was holding an impeachment hearing where committee lawyers presented evidence in the case, as Democrats begin to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump at the direction of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>
      <p>It was a day dominated by the lawyers for the Democrats and the Republicans.</p>

      <p>Democratic lawyers outlined the findings so far, saying Trump’s push to have Ukraine investigate rival Joe Biden while at the same time withholding U.S. military aid ran counter to US policy and benefited Russia as well as himself. Republicans then offered their rebuttal, saying the evidence does not support the allegations and instead is “riddled with hearsay, presumptions and speculation.”</p>

      <p>The top Republican on the panel, Rep. Doug Collins said Democrats are racing to jam impeachment through on a “clock and a calendar” ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>“They can’t get over the fact that Donald Trump is the president of the United States and they don’t have a candidate that can beat him,” Mr Collins said.</p>
      <p>Trump spent the morning tweeting against the proceedings. He and his allies acknowledge he likely will be impeached in the Democratic-controlled House, but they also expect acquittal next year in the Senate, where Republicans have the majority.</p>
      <p>Democrats allege that Mr Trump abused the power of his office by using as leverage nearly $US400 million in military assistance to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company.</p>
