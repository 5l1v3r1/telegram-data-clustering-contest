      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:20:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Pub chain Brewdog is offering free drinks for everyone that takes part in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> on Thursday in bid to get the nation voting.</p>
      <p>The brewer's Vote Punk bus - which first made appearances during the 2016 EU referendum campaign - is back and travelling the country with free pints for everyone that votes.</p>
      <p>It's a nod to the scandalous <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Bus that inaccurately claimed the UK sends £350million worth of NHS money to the EU every year.</p>
      <p>To receive your free pint, you'll have to take a selfie outside the polling station which you can show at the till at your local <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/uk/bars/">BrewDog UK Bar</a> .</p>
      <p>The offer will be running on election day itself - Thursday - for those who vote in person.</p>
      <p>Those who voted by post can show their registration confirmation email at the bar on December 12 to qualify.</p>
      <p>You'll be able to choose from four different beers: Punk IPA, their flagship IPA, Punk AF, BrewDog’s new alcohol free IPA, Nanny State alcohol free hoppy ale, or Vagabond gluten free American pale ale.</p>
      <p>"We want to reward anyone voting in the General Election with a Punk IPA on us. Whatever your views, whatever your status, every vote was created equal," said James Watt, co-founder of BrewDog.</p>
      <p>"We’re not affiliated with any political party, we don’t care who you vote for but we would like to buy you a beer. Whatever is next for our country, drinking great craft beer might just get us through it."</p>
      <p>BrewDog is not the first brand to use a controversial bus placement ad to wade into the 2019 general election debate.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a Burger King ad read "another whopper on the side of a bus. Must be an election."</p>
      <p>Back in January, Channel 4 jumped on the Brexit bus bandwagon to promote its series with Benedict Cumberbatch.</p>
      <p>Instead of 'take back control' the red bus read "take back the remote control. Watch gripping new TV drama."</p>
      <p>On Friday, December 13, the nation will wake up to a new Government, and now is your chance to have your say.</p>
      <p>Voters can can get on top of all of the election coverage on our page <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">here</a> - including polls, predictions and more.</p>
      <p>But even if you've missed out - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/registering-vote-makes-you-richer-20809428">it's still worth making sure you're on the electoral roll</a> - as it could make you richer.</p>
      <p>Registering to vote instantly boosts your credit score - a factor lenders look at when deciding whether to lend you money for a loan or mortgage.</p>
      <p>It is seen as a sign of stability by banks and can therefore mean you get better access to better rates on loans and mortgages - and can even help with things such as taking out a mobile contract.</p>
