      <p>Confirming leaks <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/leak-reveals-platinumgames-vanquish-is-getting-a-remaster">from last week</a>, Sega has announced a that will deliver enhanced versions of the two action games for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The bundle will ship on February 18, 2020, with digital and physical editions available.</p>
      <p>The PlatinumGames-developed titles will come remastered to run at 4K resolution and 60FPS on both the Xbox One X and the PlayStation 4 Pro systems. Sega hasn't revealed how well will the titles perform on the standard editions of the consoles.</p>
      <p>The physical release will arrive in a SteelBook case that will come featuring new cover art "produced by Weapons Van, supervised by <i>Bayonetta </i>director Hideki Kamiya and Sega." It appears a PC version is not in the works. However, since the games' <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/bayonetta-finally-makes-its-debut-on-the-pc-in-glorious-4k">relatively recently</a> released <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/vanquish-finally-announced-for-pc-steam-pre-order-now-available">PC editions</a> already feature the high FPS and resolution enhancements, this is to be expected.</p>
      <p>The <i>Bayonetta &amp; Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle</i> comes in at $39.99 and pre-purchasing options for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 can be found on the <a href="https://bayonettavanquish.sega.com/home.html">official landing page</a> set up by Sega.</p>
