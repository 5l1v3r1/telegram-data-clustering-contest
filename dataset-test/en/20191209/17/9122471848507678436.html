      <p>It’s been quite the year so far for Ohio State’s football and men’s basketball programs. The Buckeyes received the No. 2 seed in the College Football Playoff on Sunday. This afternoon, Chris Holtmann’s team received a bump in the Associated Press poll.</p>
      <p>Ohio State’s men’s basketball team has arguably been the most-impressive team in the country. The Buckeyes blew out North Carolina in Chapel Hill earlier last week, before dominating Penn State at home.</p>
      <p>Holtmann’s team is up to No. 3 in the AP Poll, trailing Louisville and Kansas. Maryland and Michigan round out the top five.</p>
