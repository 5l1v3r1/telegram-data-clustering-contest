      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Sungai Pelek assemblyman Ronnie Liu has given his statement to police over his attendance at the 30th anniversary of the Hat Yai Peace Accord last week.</p>
      <p>His lawyer, Ramkarpal Singh, who accompanied him to record his statement said the DAP central executive committee member’s statement was taken as a witness.</p>
      <p>“His statement was taken as a witness, it was a short statement. It was taken under Section 112 Criminal Procedure Code.</p>
      <p>“The case is being investigated under Section 505(c) of the Penal Code for intent to incite or which is likely to incite any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons.</p>
      <p>“YB Ronnie has no such intention, he made it clear to the police in his statement,” Ramkarpal said after about an hour at the federal police headquarters at Bukit Aman, here, today.</p>
      <p>Liu gave a speech at the 30th anniversary of the Hat Yai Peace Accord in Kajang on Dec 1.</p>
      <p>He said he had attended the gathering in his personal capacity.</p>
      <p>Some 300 people, mostly elderly folk, allegedly former Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) members, attended the event commemorating the treaty.</p>
      <p>The treaty signed between CPM and the government on Dec 2, 1989, ended the 21-year long communist insurgency in Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
