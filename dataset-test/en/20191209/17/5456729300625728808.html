      <p>Torin Pocock, an English actor who featured in Hollywood’s ‘Star Wars’ has made his debut in a Nollywood film titled ‘Kpali’.</p>
      <p>Pocock plays Jake Hunters, Amaka Kalayor’s friend in the movie.</p>
      <p>He was featured alongside Nollywood big names like Ini Dima-Okojie, Nkem Owoh, and Gloria Anozie Young.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES gathered that the actor visited Nigeria for the first time in June 2017 to shoot some major scenes in the film.</p>
      <p>Produced by creative industry entrepreneur, Emem Ema, the suspense-filled movie is being released in collaboration with Genesis Deluxe Distribution.</p>
      <p>‘Kpali’, which was shot in different locations in Lagos and London, was directed by Ladi Johnson.</p>
      <p>The story unfolds around Amaka, a Nigerian professional who works in an investment bank in London. Life throws her a curveball as her UK employer suddenly has to trim its workforce and she may lose her job. It gets complicated as her work visa is about to expire.</p>
      <p>In a twist, Amaka’s employer gives her a lifeline to win a big account with a Lagos-based, Nigerian company. She must head to Nigeria with a colleague of hers on this desperate mission.</p>

      <p>But there is a caveat, the deal must be wrapped up in 30 Days or else she loses everything.</p>
      <p>According to the Executive Producer, Abhulime Ehiagwina, who has ‘Kpali’ as his first foray into the film business, the movie offers a gripping story that a large spectrum of moviegoers can relate to irrespective of gender and age.</p>
