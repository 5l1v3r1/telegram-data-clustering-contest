        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> team principal Mattia Binotto thinks the accusations of his team cheating around the United States Grand Prix was a mere ploy to increase the pressure on the Italian side.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> was the only one to actually call out Ferrari for cheating, with the Dutchman saying the SF90's poor performance in Austin was <i>"what you get when you stop cheating"</i>. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> had reportedly asked the FIA in Austin to make it clear what is and isn't allowed when it comes to fuel flow into the engine. Although they didn't ask the FIA to investigate Ferrari, the Italians coincidentally struggled to keep up with Red Bull and Mercedes all weekend. Their straight-line speed had also decreased significantly. </p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/formel-1/f1-interview-ferrari-teamchef-mattia-binotto/"><i>Auto Motor und Sport</i></a>, Binotto explained that this was indeed a coincidence, as Ferrari just ran a more downforce-heavy set-up at the Circuit of the Americas.</p>

        <i>"It's true our advantage has decreased since the new FIA guidelines, but teams draw the wrong conclusions. We didn't change anything about the engines. We increased drag to have more downforce. That's why we're quicker in the corners now, but slower on the straights."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The 50-year-old also understood rivals took advantage of the cheating claims just to rattle the chains at Ferrari.</p>
      <p><i>"I'm not sure they actually doubt our integrity," </i>he continued. <i>"They use the circumstances to put pressure on us. That pressure is distracting. It's part of the Formula 1 game to unsettle your opponents. It's not just about sportive and technical competitiveness - everything that damages your rivals is good for you. Everyone plays the game that way."</i></p>
