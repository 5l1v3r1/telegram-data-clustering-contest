      <h2>Plans for it to be a zero carbon campus</h2>

      <p>The new £42 million Carrick Academy super school is set to have a huge wind turbine on site.</p>
      <p>It would measure 30 metres in height and generate electricity for the building. </p>
      <p>The state-of-the-art Maybole campus will be environmentally friendly and completely carbon neutral vows South Ayrshire Council. </p>
      <p> It is due to open in August 2021 if all goes to plan after securing funding from the Scottish Government. </p>
      <p>The council  has lodged a proposal of application notice for the erection of the turbine as part of its plans for the huge secondary. </p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: “We are designing the new Maybole campus to be a net zero carbon facility and as part of that plan we are looking to generate our own electricity on site using technology such as wind turbines and photovoltaics."</p>
      <p>She said the council's Sustainable Development and Climate Change Strategy has set targets for reducing carbon emissions over the next five years. </p>
      <p>The new Kirkoswald Road school will align with the recently adopted strategy.</p>
      <p>Turbines in wind farms would normally be three times the height of the one earmarked for the school.</p>
      <p>The mega Maybole education centre would be home to a replacement high school, three primaries and a nursery.</p>
      <p>The plan is for Cairn and Gardenrose primaries to merge and St Cuthbert’s Primary will also have a new base on the site.</p>
      <p>A swimming pool is also among the proposals along with two all weather pitches for rugby and football.</p>
      <p>The campus could hold 1400 children.</p>
      <p>Morgan Sindall Construction is in line to carry out the building work.</p>
