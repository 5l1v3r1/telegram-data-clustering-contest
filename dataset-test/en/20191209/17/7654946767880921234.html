      <p>Brave 4-year-old twin girls escaped a Washington state car wreck and went looking for help in the dark after their father was killed in the crash, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Corey Simmons, 47, of Langley, didn’t survive after his Nissan Sentra hurtled off a winding Whidbey Island road — skidding at least 100 feet into a ravine and striking multiple trees before it finally stopped, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/langley-twins-just-4-years-old-escape-car-crash-and-climb-embankment-to-find-help/">The Seattle Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t wearing a seat belt and suffered a head injury, according to the report.</p>
      <p>After the crash, his identical twin daughters, Rosaline and Aurora, unbuckled their booster seats and checked on their father, the paper reported.</p>
      <p>When they realized he wasn’t talking and needed help, they climbed out of a broken car window and trudged uphill toward the road, Washington State Patrol Trooper Heather Axtman told the outlet.</p>
      <p>A good Samaritan saw the pair — both missing their shoes — on the roadside and called 911.</p>
      <p>“She was at the right spot at the right time,” Axtman told the Times, referring to the woman who helped. “She knew something was tragic. The girls got in the car and said: ‘My daddy, my daddy, my daddy.’”</p>
      <p>Simmons’ girlfriend and the twins’ mother, Esther Crider, told the paper that both girls were “scared and running around in the dark trying to go home.”</p>

      <p>“A lady in a white car helped them get warm,” she said.</p>
      <p>First responders found Simmons dead inside the car and brought the twins to a nearby health center — Rosaline with a bump on her forehead and Aurora with scratches on her forearm.</p>
      <p>Both girls, who Crider described as “independent,” are set to enter kindergarten next fall.</p>
      <p>“It’s heartbreaking,” their mother told the paper. “Rosaline used to giggle in her sleep. Now she’s crying.”</p>
      <p>Axtman called them “incredible heroes.”</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the truly saddest stories but so heroic at the exact same time,” the police official said. “Had those little girls not had the sense of awareness they showed, we would have a missing family. They overcame every typical little kid fear. The woods and the dark.”</p>
      <p>The cause of the crash is under investigation.</p>
      <p>Crider said Simmons “drove up and down that road every day for about five years.”</p>
      <p>Simmons, a handyman, also leaves behind an 8-year-old son from another relationship.</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe page set up to cover Simmons’ funeral expenses and support the family had raised more than $6,000 of its $18,000 goal by Monday morning.</p>
