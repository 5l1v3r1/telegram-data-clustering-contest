      <h1>Game of Thrones' Iwan Rheon joins American Gods</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:00:31+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Moore</a></address>
      <p>From Westeros to… overly stereotyped Ireland?</p>
      <p>Iwan Rheon is all set to join the cast of the TV adaptation of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/neil-gaiman/">Neil Gaiman</a>’s fantasy series <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/11/american-gods-season-2-episode-1-review-a-hollow-return-8881292/">American Gods</a> for its upcoming third season.</p>
      <p>And he’s set to leave behind the nastiness of Ramsay Bolton – who he played on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game of Thrones</a> between 2013 and 2016 – for this new role, in which he’ll play a ‘charming, good-natured leprechaun’ who goes by the name Liam Doyle.</p>
      <p>Seriously.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/12/04/american-gods-season-3-iwan-rheon-leprechaun/">EW</a>, Rheon’s latest character is introduced as someone trying to steer away from the cliched leprechaun image – ‘until he finds himself swept back into our world of gods, luck, and magic,’ that is.</p>
      <p>This looks set to be Rheon’s most eye-catching role <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/01/19/game-of-thrones-star-iwan-rheon-reveals-why-he-couldnt-turn-down-the-chance-to-play-hitler-6392536/">since he played, er, Adolf Hitler in an episode of the surreal Sky Arts comedy series Urban Myths in 2017.</a></p>
      <p>Joining the Welsh actor on the cast list for American Gods season three – which has yet to receive an expected air date – is the one and only <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marilyn-manson/">Marilyn Manson</a>.</p>

      <p>Viking death metal musicians and leprechauns getting involved in all kinds of magical shenanigans together? It could only be American Gods.</p>
