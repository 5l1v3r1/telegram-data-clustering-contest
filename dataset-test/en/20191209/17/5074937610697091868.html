      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:28:58+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Emmanuel Todd, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Dec 9, GNA - Ms Esther A.N Cobbah, has encouraged worshipers who joined in the Stratcomm Africa Praise Jam 2019 not to give up in tough moments, but rather trust in the Lord in such times.</p>
      <p>She said the best thing in life is when you know God is with you in trying times.</p>
      <p>She said this during her remarks at the 13th edition of the event held to give praise to God for preserving the company for the past 25 years together with friends, family, corporate partners, the public and workers of Stratcomm Africa.</p>
      <p>It was also to mark the company's 25 years of existence; on the theme; â€œAll that we have accomplished You have done for us, Isaiah 26:12.</p>
      <p>She said just as God had taken stratcomm through the past 25 years from its humble beginnings, she was hopeful that the same God was equally able to come through for anybody going through trails.</p>
      <p>"We started 25 years ago in a shipping container, but the Lord through his faithfulness and providence has brought us this far; we are joyful and proud to give Him due praise,"she said.</p>
      <p>She said over the past years through the help of God, the company impacted over 200 companies and affected the lives of many people who worked with them.</p>
      <p>She said the company in 2020 would focus on communication excellence in the digital age in Africa; to highlight the importance of communication.</p>
      <p>She said communication was an art and science and must be given the needed attention to enhance businesses and sharing of information in the digital age.</p>
      <p>Mrs Cynthia Agyare Appiadu of the "Daughters of Glorious Jesus" fame told the Ghana News Agency after their ministration at the event that God did new things each time and that no condition was permanent.</p>
      <p>She said the group was equally celebrating its 30th Anniversary in the Gospel music industry and were equally grateful to God .</p>
      <p>The worshipers were also blessed with worship ministrations by Becky Bonney, Reverend Ifueko Charmien, Nene Kwadwo,Eugene Zuta, Kafui Dake/Nana Osei Kyei Mensah and the Royal Vessels.</p>
