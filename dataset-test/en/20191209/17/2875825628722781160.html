      <p>Kyle Walker insists Manchester City are not ready to give up on the title - despite a "massive gap" between themselves and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool.</a></p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's back-to-back champions trail runaway leaders Liverpool by 14 points following their 2-1 derby defeat at home to local rivals <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United.</a></p>
      <p>Saturday's defeat at the Etihad Stadium was City's fourth of the Premier League campaign and Guardiola's side have now dropped 16 points in as many games this season.</p>
      <p>City's latest defeat has all but extinguished any hope they had of making it a hat-trick of titles, but defender Walker said the Blues will not throw in the towel while there is still an outside chance.</p>
      <p>"It's a massive gap, we know that," said Walker. "We need to keep fighting until the end. It's not over until it's over, we will keep trying.</p>

      <p>"There was a big difference between the first and the second half [against United]. Going to the half-time two goals ahead it was very positive for them.</p>
      <p>"We knew they have quick players in quick areas. Martial, Rashford and James, they're very good in the counter-attack.</p>
      <p>"We knew that and we didn't handle it as well as we could have as a team."</p>
      <p>Walker's fellow full-back Angelino, who had a torrid time in the United defeat, said: â€œIt's the Manchester derby. We knew it would be hard. We tried to get a good result.</p>

      <p>"It's obviously not what we expected, but we're proud of the team, because we fought until the end. We created more chances than them, but we didn't score the goals.</p>
      <p>"We tried and we kept trying until the last minute. We need to keep this mentality for the next games.</p>
      <p>"Our focus is to win every game. We don't think about the table. We need to focus on the positive and keep fighting.</p>
      <p>"We are focused to keep improving, keep winning games. That's our mentality. We need to remain focused and try to do our best in every game."</p>
