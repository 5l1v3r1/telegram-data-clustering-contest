      <p>Reconnaissance flights over New Zealand’s White Island volcano have not identified any survivors there after Monday’s eruption, police said.</p>
      <p>Up to 50 people were believed to be on the island.</p>
      <p>Five people are known to have died and 23 were rescued, some of them critically ill with burn injuries.</p>
      <p>Police believe anyone who could have been found alive was evacuated.</p>
      <p>Rescuers have been unable to search the island because of the risk of new eruptions, and it is now dark.</p>
      <p>Tourists were seen walking inside the crater of White Island volcano moments before it erupted.</p>

      <p>“Based on the information we have, we do not believe there are any survivors on the island,” the latest police update said.</p>
      <p>White Island, also called Whakaari, is the country’s most active volcano. Despite that, the privately-owned island is a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available.</p>
      <p>Deputy Police Commissioner John Tims told journalists that “both New Zealand and overseas tourists” were believed to be involved. (BBC)</p>
