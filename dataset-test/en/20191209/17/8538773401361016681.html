      <p>The playoffs roll along in fantasy football, with Week 15 representing -- in ESPN's default settings -- the second week of the semifinals. The reality for your roster may be that it is set and you're rolling back out the same crew as last week, needing to either hold serve because of a points edge you already have or looking to come from behind.</p>
      <p>But that may not be the case for everyone. You may need a Hail Mary this week. Or you've simply been vulnerable at a particular position and are looking for reinforcements.</p>
      <p>No matter what brings you to the waiver wire, trust that you are welcomed!</p>
      <p>Without further ado, here are the Week 15 ESPN Fantasy waiver-wire adds of note.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Note: All players in this column are available in more than 50% of leagues on ESPN.com.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill">Ryan Tannehill</a>, QB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a> (37.5%): </b>Absolutely incredible. That's how Tannehill has played this season, as he now owns the longest streak in the NFL with seven straight games of at least two touchdowns. He's playing with plenty of confidence and just keeps on churning out yards and fantasy points. What more is there to see?</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2978109/zach-pascal">Zach Pascal</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> (29.2%):</b> Stepping into a prominent role once again with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14924/ty-hilton">T.Y. Hilton</a> out, Pascal had another productive Sunday, totaling five catches for 74 yards and a touchdown. He has seen 19 targets over the past two weeks and is clearly the wide receiver the Colts are going to rely upon most until Hilton returns. For as long as Hilton is out, Pascal is a borderline top-30 wide receiver play.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047646/aj-brown">A.J. Brown</a>, WR, Tennessee Titans (30.7%):</b> The Titans have a budding star on their hands in Brown, who piled up another 153 yards on five catches Sunday, scoring twice, including a 91-yarder. He's so fun to watch and Tannehill is playing lights-out football. Sure, there isn't the same sample size of consistency as some other players have, but the upside on Brown is far too hard to ignore. He's going to be so good for such a long time.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576414/raheem-mostert">Raheem Mostert</a>, RB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> (24.1%):</b> Yes, the 49ers' backfield is really tough to size up from week to week, as there are a lot of talented players in it. That being said, whenever Mostert gets a chance, he produces, as he found the end zone again Sunday. While <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2979477/tevin-coleman">Tevin Coleman</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3049916/matt-breida">Matt Breida</a> figure into the mix, Mostert had a team-high 10 carries and the eye test consistently suggests that he's the best runner on the roster right now. He needs to be added for potential flex value.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573401/tyler-higbee">Tyler Higbee</a>, TE, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams">Los Angeles Rams</a> (11.4%):</b> Here's a full list of tight ends who have had at least 100 receiving yards in consecutive games this season: <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews">Mark Andrews</a> and Higbee. With <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918639/gerald-everett">Gerald Everett</a> out, Higbee has been the go-to Rams tight end of late and taken full advantage of it. Given the workload, he's a usable tight end until Everett's return.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036131/noah-fant">Noah Fant</a>, TE, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a> (29.7%):</b> An injury forced Fant out of action in Week 14, but as of this writing, there has not been a definitive and clear suggestion as to whether he'll be available in Week 15. But if he does play, there's plenty of value, as Fant has shown flashes of stardom this season, as was evidenced this past Sunday when he sailed north of 110 receiving yards with a touchdown. Should he be healthy enough to go, he's an upside tight end play.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15349/cole-beasley">Cole Beasley</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills">Buffalo Bills</a> (30.8%):</b> A repeat visitor to this column, Beasley did what he has done throughout the season again in Week 14: put up double-digit fantasy points, as he had four catches for 29 yards and a touchdown. He has at least nine fantasy points in all but two of his games this season and has flex value in a deeper league.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050487/anthony-miller">Anthony Miller</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a> (18.5%):</b> The Bears' offense has found its groove of late and Miller has been a contributor to that success, as he has averaged over nine targets per game in that time and scored double-digit fantasy points in each outing. He found the end zone on one of his three Week 14 catches and is an ascending player worthy of flex consideration in a deeper league.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916945/darius-slayton">Darius Slayton</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> (32.9%):</b> Slayton has been absolutely electric for the Giants this season, putting on an absolute show on Monday night. He has at least four catches in each of his past four games, with two games of multiple touchdowns. He has incredible speed and is the kind of upside play who should be utilized for those needing upside in a matchup versus a strong fantasy opponent. He's really a joy to watch.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051439/boston-scott">Boston Scott</a>, RB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> (0.2%):</b> While it may be uncertain if Scott maintains a role going forward, Philly is thin on playmakers right now, and he stepped up in a major way on Monday night. If <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3060022/jordan-howard">Jordan Howard</a> returns or wide receivers get healthy, that may already limit Scott's outlook. But if you're in a deep league and need a flier for your flex, Scott is worth consideration.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4045305/ian-thomas">Ian Thomas</a>, TE, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> (0.4%):</b> With <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10475/greg-olsen">Greg Olsen</a> out because of a concussion, Thomas once again stepped into a featured role. He scored, had five catches and saw 10 total targets in the Panthers' loss to Atlanta. Should Olsen miss more time, Thomas is a serviceable tight end to insert into your lineup.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14129/bilal-powell">Bilal Powell</a>, RB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> (0.6%):</b> While it seems unlikely that <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15825/le'veon-bell">Le'Veon Bell</a> will miss another game due to illness, Powell was the backup who stepped up in his absence Sunday, handling a team-high 19 rushing attempts for 74 yards. We'll see on Bell's status, but Powell is a stash on a just-in-case basis.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577654/deandre-washington">DeAndre Washington</a>, RB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/oak/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> (0.9%): </b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047365/josh-jacobs">Josh Jacobs</a> was a close call to play for the Raiders, but he wound up having to sit out his first game during his NFL career due to a shoulder issue. Washington and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2972091/jalen-richard">Jalen Richard</a> both saw time in Jacobs' absence, but Washington was the workhorse with 14 rushing attempts, which included a touchdown. Jacobs' absence doesn't appear to be a long one, but Washington is the add in case he does sit in Week 15.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3127211/patrick-laird">Patrick Laird</a>, RB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> (10.1%):</b> While the Dolphins really struggle to run the football, Laird is the clear-cut go-to back for Miami, handling 15 carries Sunday. But it's his passing-game value that gives him fantasy value as a deep-league flex consideration, as he has excellent receiving skills and back-to-back games with four catches.</p>
