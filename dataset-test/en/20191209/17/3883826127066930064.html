        <b>A woman was stabbed to death in a fight following a car crash, police say.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mother-of-two Levi Davis, 25, died in Wellingborough Road, Rushden, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>She was in a VW Polo that was in collision with a Vauxhall van just before an argument broke out, Northamptonshire Police said.</p>
      <p>A man, 27, was arrested on suspicion of murder. He had serious injuries and a 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of his attempted murder.</p>
      <p>A 13-year-old boy, also arrested on suspicion of murder, was released on Sunday night with no further action to be taken.</p>

      <p>Supt Dennis Murray said: "The vehicles were involved in some sort of altercation before the crash.</p>
      <p>"There was a fight and, as a result, the person died. My heart goes out to the lady's family."</p>
      <p>He dismissed the idea Ms Davis had been the victim of a mugging, and said police believed those involved knew each other.</p>
      <p>Two other cars with smashed windows - a Fiat and a white Nissan Note, which are thought to have been in a crash further up the road - were also taken away by police.</p>

      <h3>'Tried to help'</h3>
      <p>People living nearby described how they rushed to Ms Davis's aid.</p>
      <p>One woman said: "People tried to help, but she died very quickly."</p>
      <p>Pattamaea Kuttppa, a 77-year-old retired aircraft engineer, said: "I heard a big thud. At first I thought it was a car accident.</p>
      <p>"Police were coming from all sides. They searched my garden looking for clues."</p>
