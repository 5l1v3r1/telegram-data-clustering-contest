      <p>State-owned Bank Mandiri’s shareholders have officially appointed Royke Tumilaar to be the bank’s new president director.</p>
      <p>Royke, the lender’s former corporate banking director, is to replace Kartika "Tiko" Wirjoatmodjo, who resigned from his post in October after he was appointed to be one of State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) Minister Erick Thohir’s deputy ministers.</p>
      <p>“We believe the newly appointed management consists of the best people who can collaborate in developing the company’s business, particularly in the corporate and retail segment,” corporate secretary Rohan Hafas said in a statement after the bank held an extraordinary shareholders meeting in Jakarta on Monday.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, former institutional relations director Alexandra Askandar is to replace Royke as the bank’s new corporate banking director and former senior executive vice president of corporate banking Silvano Rumantir was also appointed to be the lender’s finance director.</p>
      <p>Aside from appointing Royke, the shareholders appointed deputy minister Tiko to be president commissioner, replacing Hartadi Agus Sarwono.</p>
      <p>Former finance minister Chatib Basri was also officially appointed in the meeting to be the bank’s new vice president commissioner. Chatib would replace former secretary to the SOEs Ministry, Imam Apriyanto Putro, who resigned from his post on Nov. 19 and tasked to lead state-owned fertilizer holding company Pupuk Indonesia as vice president director.</p>
      <p>“I’m grateful that <i>Pak</i> Chatib Basri is willing to be on Bank Mandiri’s board of commissioners,” Erick said on Sunday in a statement announcing Chatib’s appointment at the bank's board of commissioners. “He is a former minister with a good reputation that wants to ‘sweat’ and improve SOEs.”</p>
      <p>Responding to his appointment, Chatib said he considered the task a challenge. He also hoped that he could help improve the bank’s performance and make it adaptable to the changes ahead.</p>
