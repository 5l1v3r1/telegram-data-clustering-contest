      <p>An auction house in US, RR Auction has sold a floppy disk signed by the late Apple co-founder for $84,000. The floppy disk has a copy of Macintosh system tools version 6.0. On the disk’s label is the signature of  Steve jobs with a black felt pen.</p>
      <h3>In fine condition</h3>
      <p>RR Auction’s website states that the floppy disk is in fine condition with slight brushing to the ink and part of the item description reads that it is a hugely desirable format for Jobs' seldom-seen autograph. Jobs is remembered as a reluctant signer and he often declined to comply with the requests of collectors making the Apple co-founder’s signature a collector’s item. </p>
