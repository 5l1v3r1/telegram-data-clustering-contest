      <p>Though Rad sold his ivy-covered home, he stayed in the neighborhood. In August of 2018, the Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hp-top-sales-20180818-story.html">reported</a> that he bought another Hollywood Hills home for a staggering $24 million.</p>

      <h3>Rad’s home wasn’t the only Hollywood Hills home seeking a buyer this year. In September, Business Insider reported that former professional baseball player Alex Rodriguez sold his Hollywood Hills mansion for $4.4 million — roughly $400,000 less than what he reportedly purchased it for.</h3>
