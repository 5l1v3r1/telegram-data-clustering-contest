      <h1>Lil Baby Shows off Dance Moves and Luxury Cars in "Woah" Video</h1>
      <h2>Ahead of his new album’s forthcoming release.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:40:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">Nia Groce</a></address>
      <p>After dropping off <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/lil-baby-woah-single-stream">his single “Woah”</a> last month, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lil-baby">Lil Baby</a> has followed up to share the official video for the track. Directed by Edgar Esteves, the visual sees the rapper and friends hit a parking lot to show off their luxury rides, all the while surrounded by fans and kids who take their turn hitting the “Woah” dance.</p>
      <p>The song and video marks the first from Lil Baby’s forthcoming sophomore album, which is expected to arrive in the coming weeks. The clip takes cues from the <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/fast-furious">Fast &amp; Furious</a></i> films, or at least street car culture: in between the clips of the dancing crowd, Lil Baby is challenged to a street race. By accepting the challenge, the rapper puts it all on the line. Of course, the video is kept light-hearted, emphasizing the song’s signature dance and a party atmosphere more than the racing storyline, though it does show a series of cars drifting around Lil Baby himself.</p>
      <p>Perhaps in part to the overwhelming popularity of “Woah,” fellow musicians have turned to Lil Baby for a variety of recent features. These include singles like <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/bankroll-freddie-young-dolph-lil-baby-drip-like-dis-remix-single-stream">Bankroll Freddie’s “Drip Like Dis”</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/young-scooter-lil-baby-petty-song-stream">Young Scooter’s “Petty.”</a> He was also featured on <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/post-malone-hollywoods-bleeding-album-stream">Post Malone’s <i>Hollywood’s Bleeding</i> album</a>, which was released in September.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Lil Baby shared the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/lil-baby-back-on-music-video">video for his track “Back On”</a> in October.</p>
