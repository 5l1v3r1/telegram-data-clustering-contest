      <p>The Cambridges and the Sussexes will 'need' to 'raise their game' next year after <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/prince-andrew/index.html"><b>Prince Andrew</b></a>'s sacking, according to royal commentators. </p>
      <p>Royal expert Omid Scobie suggested that Prince William, 37, and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/kate_middleton/index.html"><b>Kate Middleton</b></a>, 37, as well as Prince Harry, 35, and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/meghan-markle/index.html"><b>Meghan Markle</b></a>, 38, will all be required to 'put in a lot more work' in 2020 in a year which would bring 'big change' to the family.</p>
      <p>Speaking with fellow expert Victoria Arbiter on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/on-heir-royal-news-interviews/id1354474880#episodeGuid=http%3A%2F%2Fserve.castfire.com%2Faudio%2F3685314%2F3685314_2019-10-02-214714.96.mp3"><b>Heirpod </b></a>podcast, he pointed to Prince Andrew's, 59, removal from royal duty, as well as the Queen's advancing years, as reasons why there will be more pressure on the younger generations. </p>
      <p>Victoria revealed: '2020 is going to get a lot busier for all of them with Prince Andrew out of the mix now. We've just lost one member of the royal family technically and, already, the workload increases for everyone else.'</p>

      <p>Last week, Kate took over as the new royal patron of charity Family Action, with the Queen passing on the patronage after 65 years. </p>
      <p>And earlier this summer she also took on the same role with the Royal Photographic Society, which the monarch had also been patron of for 67 years.</p>
      <p>But Omid and Victoria suggested next year could be a much busier year for Kate, as well as the other members of the family,  in part due to Prince Andrew's departure from royal duty. </p>
      <p>Omid revealed: 'It's great, she is a mother, she has three kids, she has a very busy plate as it is...but to see her taking on even more is needed.</p>

      <p>'As the Queen steps back, the younger royals having to step forward and put in a lot more work.'</p>
      <p>Victoria explained: 'Kate is quite fortunate she had their children when she did, because she's been able to be hands-on with them.</p>

      <h3>How many patronages do the royals have? </h3>
      <p>The Queen: 600+, over her lifetime</p>
      <p>Prince Phillip: 700+, over his lifetime</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew: 230, before being removed from royal duty </p>
      <p>Prince William: 38 </p>
      <p>Kate Middleton: 19 </p>
      <p>Prince Harry: 20 </p>
      <p>Meghan Markle:  6</p>

      <p>'But the schedule needs to start building now, as she offers her support to the Queen as well.'</p>
      <p>She added: '2020 will be a big year of adjustment, change and adapting with the Queen getting older, so everyone needs to start raising the game a little bit.'  </p>
      <p>Their comments come as Prince Andrew stood aside from 230 of his patronages, 'putting many back into the pot', according to Omid.</p>
      <p>But he said he 'wondered what would happen to charitable organisations that need a royal patron'. </p>
      <p>Victoria went on to add that because the younger royals are taking on fewer patronages, to give them a more focused and hands-on approach, charities would likely lose their patronages. </p>
      <p>She called them 'further collateral damage' because 'Prince Andrew is not a priority for the rest of the family at the moment and they're trying to distance themselves a little bit' to make sure that the monarchy's reputation doesn't suffer.</p>

      <p>The Duke of York was forced to step back from his public duties last month following a disastrous television interview about his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>The scandal forced the prince to resign from his patronages and royal duties, although there were reports yesterday that he planned to make his first public appearance on Christmas Day, by joining the Queen and other Royal Family members at the church service at Sandringham in Norfolk.</p>
      <p>During his disastrous Emily Maitlis interview on Newsnight, the duke denied they had discussed the Epstein scandal or Miss Roberts' claims that she was forced into having sex with Andrew.</p>
      <p>Miss Roberts, now a married mother-of-three, gave an extraordinary interview to the BBC's Panorama – aired last week – in which she said she was 'abused' by Andrew and left feeling 'ashamed and dirty'.</p>
      <p>Her lawyer Mr Scarola said: 'We want Prince Andrew to give evidence under oath and tell us all he knew about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.'</p>
      <p>Andrew has said he would co-operate with law enforcement authorities 'if required'.</p>
