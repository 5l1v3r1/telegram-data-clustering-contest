      <h1>The extent of Ross Moriarty's worrying health issue revealed as Wales and Dragons star loses stone in weight</h1>
      <h2>He has been laid low by Japan virus since the Rugby World Cup and has now seen a specialist to find out exactly what is going on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:41:50+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Orders</a></address>
      <p>Ross Moriarty is striving to be fit for the Dragons’ festive derbies after the virus he picked up at the World Cup caused him to drop around a stone in weight.</p>
      <p>The Dragons are unable to give a return-to-play date for their 41-cap back rower, who played in all seven of Wales’ World Cup matches in Japan but has suffered badly with illness since.</p>
      <p>He contracted <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/ross-moriarty-dragons-wales-barbarians-17331286">a viral infection</a> after grazing his forehead during a training session in the Far East and subsequently suffered a chest infection, a cold, loss of appetite and significant weight loss.</p>
      <p>So serious was the hard-hitting No. 8 or blindside flanker’s condition that he had to see a specialist to find out what was going on.</p>
      <p>Whether he returns over Christmas will depend on how quickly he is restored to good health and fitness and puts weight back on.</p>
      <p>That is his aim and it is understood he is heading in the right direction.</p>
      <p>But the Dragons won't use him until he's 100 percent right.</p>
      <p>Director of rugby Dean Ryan told the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/japanese-virus-could-cost-moriarty-six-nations">RugbyPass</a> website: “Ross has had a viral infection and we are not going to rush him back or give a date when he is going to play, because we want to make sure Ross has got over this infection.</p>
      <p>“He lost weight during this period and it’s important to ensure that he is fully recovered before we think about getting him back.”</p>

      <p>Wayne Pivac will doubtless stay in touch, with fitness issues <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/serious-wales-six-nations-injury-17374182">starting to pile up</a> for Wales in the back row ahead of the Six Nations. Taulupe Faletau still hasn’t returned from the collarbone injury that ruled him out of the World Cup, nor has Ellis Jenkins from his long-term knee problem.</p>
      <p>Josh Navidi remains off limits from the hamstring problem he suffered in the World Cup quarter-final against France, while Scarlets’ James Davies has a back issue and Aaron Shingler is recovering from a damaged knee.</p>
      <p>Throw in Moriarty’s health problems and the picture becomes concerning for Pivac.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old former Gloucester player is an asset because of his versatility and physicality, allied to his competitive spirit.</p>
