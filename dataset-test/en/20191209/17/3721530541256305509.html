      <p>Amazon is one-upping its own Black Friday deal, throwing in a $30 Amazon credit with the purchase of a <a href="https://amzn.to/343I5gQ">Nintendo Switch console</a>. The retailer ran a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/2/20990235/cyber-monday-2019-nintendo-switch-deals-bundle-amazon-gamestop">similar offer on Black Friday</a>, throwing in a $25 credit with the Nintendo Switch Lite. Turns out good things do come to those who wait; In this case, the good thing is some extra money to spend at Amazon.</p>
      <p>Nintendo is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emi74MDRMV8">notoriously stingy when it comes to deals</a>, which is why many retailers offer their own bundles or, in this case, store credit in lieu of official discounts. While Nintendo’s official Black Friday deal for 2019 was an outdated <i>Mario Kart 8</i> bundle, both <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/2/20990235/cyber-monday-2019-nintendo-switch-deals-bundle-amazon-gamestop">Amazon and GameStop offered a $25 gift card</a> with the Nintendo Switch Lite. And for Cyber Monday, Nintendo threw in a 128 GB microSD card with the updated Nintendo Switch model. So, given that <a href="https://amzn.to/2E3muL8">microSD cards of that size are currently going for around $20</a>, this deal is better by about $10.</p>
      <p>In order to redeem Amazon’s offer, make sure you’re adding the <a href="https://amzn.to/2LBaPHo">HAC-001(-01) model</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/13/20803700/nintendo-switch-new-model-number-release-date-battery-how-to-find-guide">detailed here</a>, to your cart (with either <a href="https://amzn.to/2LBaPHo">Red/Blue</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/343I5gQ">Gray Joy-Cons</a>.) Then enter the code <b>D3E2CDJ6GB6S </b>at checkout. (That code is listed on the Amazon page as well.) You’ll get an email from Amazon within 35 days with confirmation that the $30 credit has been added to your account.</p>
