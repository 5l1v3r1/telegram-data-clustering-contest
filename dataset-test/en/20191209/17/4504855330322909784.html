      <h1>Florida mother, father and teenage son all battling cancer at the same time</h1>

      <p>(CNN) — It’s difficult enough to have one loved one experience cancer, but three at one time? Unimaginable.</p>
      <p>But that’s reality for the Desclefs family.</p>
      <p>Benoit Desclefs, his wife, Kathy Desclefs, and their 17-year-old son Luke are each battling a different form of cancer.</p>
      <p>“Oh, it’s hard to process,” Kathy Desclefs told <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2019/12/04/downtown-business-owner-wife-17-year-old-son-all-diagnosed-with-cancer-need-your-help/">CNN affiliate WJXT.</a></p>
      <p>It all started five years ago when Kathy was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>
      <p>Then, in August, Benoit was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, then Luke was diagnosed that October with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>
      <p>Benoit, a French chef, moved to Jacksonville, Florida, to start a restaurant and experience the American dream. He called it The Magnificat Cafe. Now, the family has to put the business on the market due to their failing health.</p>
      <p>“With Benoit, they’ve said roughly 12 years. With Luke, he has a very good prognosis if he responds to treatment and we’ll know how well he responds next week when they do a PET scan (positron emission tomography),” Kathy said. “For me, it’s hard to say because the variant I have is so rare they don’t have a lot of data on that.”</p>
      <p>All the family is asking for is for people to come to the restaurant and help them stay in business through this hard time.</p>
      <p>They have had to hire extra help in order to keep it going.</p>
      <p>Kathy explained that all they can do it rely on their faith. “We are set up for God to show up because it’s so over the top,” she said.</p>
