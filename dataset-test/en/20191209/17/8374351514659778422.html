      <h1>Pump prices on rollback this week</h1>

      <p>Budget of Filipino consumers for fuel this week will be partly eased, as pump prices will be on a new round of rollback at the scale of P0.40 per liter for gasoline and kerosene; and P0.10 per liter for diesel.</p>
      <p>The oil companies had uniform price cuts for gasoline and kerosene; but they have differing adjustments for diesel products.</p>
      <p>The country’ independent players had been a bit more generous with price reduction of P0.10 per liter for diesel; while major player Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation had not implemented any rollback on its diesel products.</p>
      <p>As of press time, the oil companies that already announced price reductions include Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation, Cleanfuel, Seaoil, Phoenix Petroleum, PetroGazz, PTT, Chevron, Flying V and Total — mostly effective on Tuesday (November 10).</p>
      <p>The rest of the industry players are anticipated to follow as has always been the case on the weekly pricing adjustments of the oil companies in the country.</p>
