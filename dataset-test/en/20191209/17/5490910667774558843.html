      <h1>VSCO Girl Holiday Gift Guide</h1>
      <h2>Metal straws, Birkenstocks and Burt's Bees lip balm are some of the spot on products for this Generation Z subculture.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:24:56+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Arthur Zaczkiewicz</a></address>
      <p>As the VSCO girl meme gained popularity across high schools earlier this fall, brands, marketers and the media tried to figure out not only how this <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/marketing-promotion/outside-view-hrc-advisory-farla-efros-gen-z-millennials-1203228239/">Generation Z</a> subculture evolved, but also ways to make money from them.</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, the social media meme spotlights teenage girls who don oversize T-shirts, use environmentally friendly metal straws and carry their Hydro Flask-branded bottles in Fjallräven backpacks. They like shopping at Urban Outfitters, and tout their looks on VSCO, the photo app, as well as TikTok and Instagram. But for most images, they use Polaroid- and Fujifilm-branded instant print cameras.</p>
      <p>So while the experts try to figure out how to tap this market, WWD is showcasing a few VSCO girl must-haves for the holiday shopping season:</p>
      <p><b>Hydro Flask</b> 21-ounce standard mouth insulated bottle with sport cap, $35.95 on hydroflask.com. Editor’s note: To make it authentic, VSCO girls cover their Hydro Flasks in stickers.</p>
