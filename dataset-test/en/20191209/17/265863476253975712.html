      <p><i>The Bachelorette</i> alum Ashley Hebert and her husband J.P. Rosenbaum has revealed he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome.</p>
      <p>Herbert used Instagram Stories to share the news of what was going on with her hubby.</p>
      <p>“JP was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome yesterday. He is in treatment and doing well. It may be a long road to full recovery, but we are so grateful to everyone that has helped us get to a speedy diagnosis and treatment,” she captioned her Instagram Stories, alongside a photo of Rosenbaum in the hospital.</p>

      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe the condition as a rare autoimmune disorder, in which a person’s immune system can cause damage to the nerves, weaken the muscles and sometimes cause paralysis.</p>
      <p>Rosenbaum and Hebert met during her <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/the-bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-and-bryan-abasolo-are-married-heres-why-the-bride-chose-a-gorgeous-randi-rahm-gown-314740/">season of <i>The Bachelorette.</i></a> They wed in a lavish wedding that was televised in 2012. The couple has two children, son Fordham and daughter Essex.</p>
      <p>Not long after his wife shared his news, Rosenbaum uploaded several videos from his hospital bed to discuss his diagnoses.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I had to Google that one too. Very surreal and humbling and crazy, rare. Things you do every day, like picking up this phone, or buttoning buttons, tying shoelaces, putting on deodorant, just can’t do it. Picking up my kids can’t do it. Wiping your ass, maybe TMI, but might have Ashley assist on the next one. I can’t really believe it. I know there’s a lot of physical therapy in my future. Can’t really believe it,” Rosenbaum shared.</p>

      <p>The 42-year-old also got candid about his recovery. Rosenbaum is aware he is facing several weeks in the hospital for recovery. Later he shared a photo of Hebert lying next to him in bed, thanking her for her love, as well as everyone else who has reached out to the couple.</p>
      <p>J.P. Rosenbaum has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. He is grateful to have his loving wife, Ashley Hebert, by his side.</p>
      <p>Their love story is one for the books. They may have met on television, as he was one of many trying to win her heart, but the couple is the real deal.</p>
      <p>It is going to be a rough few weeks for the reality TV star and his wife. Hopefully, all goes well, and Rosenbaum is feeling better and home with his family soon.</p>
