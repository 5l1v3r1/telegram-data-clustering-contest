      <p>The Banyana Banyana captain was present for her team’s 2-0 victory over Limpopo’s Ma-Indies 2-0 in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, and was visibly delighted to see her ranks – which include Amanda Dlamini – get the job done and qualify for the 2020 SWNL. </p>
      <p>Despite defeat in the final for Ma-Indies, it was not all doom and gloom though, with the runners-up also securing their place in the SWNL as well as R100,000 in prize money – JVW FC won R200,000.</p>
      <p>Ciara Picco, the head Coach of JVW, was ecstatic with the result, expressing her opinion that the SWNL is where her players should be. </p>
      <p>As quoted by SAFA.net, Picco said, “We are very happy for this title, and I want to congratulate my players for their display and the passion, hunger and resilience they showed throughout the tournament.</p>
