      <h1>Whopping 550-home development in Plymouth is getting underway</h1>
      <h2>The site clearance follows the removal of the industrial buildings which was given permission in March</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:13:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Oldfield</a></address>
      <p>Work is being planned for the next stage of a massive demolition job ahead of building hundreds of homes at a former China Clay dryer works.</p>
      <p>A planning application has gone in from Homes England to clear the land at the site off Coypool Road, on the eastern edge of Plymouth.</p>
      <p>It will mean removing roads, hard-standing, slabs left beneath demolished buildings, a concrete water tank, pipe work, contamination, and any leftover services, foundations and obstructions.</p>
      <p>Consultation on the application submitted to Plymouth City Council outlining the demolition and removal project ends on Tuesday, January 2. </p>
      <p>The site clearance follows the removal of the industrial buildings which was given permission in March.</p>
      <p>A planning application f<a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-could-550-new-homes-3241072">or a new community of 550 homes to be known as Coypool Park</a> has yet to be decided by the council.</p>
      <p>The outline application on behalf of Homes England sets out plans for up to 490 homes, a complex for the elderly with 60 units and a community hub including a nursery, cafe, offices and shops.</p>
      <p>The development would see a new community set in almost 40 acres of woodland on the former industrial site in the Plym Valley, around five kilometres (three miles) north-east of the city centre.</p>

      <p>A statement with the planning application by LDA Design on behalf of Homes England said: “Up to 550 homes will be provided with a mix to suit everyone, from apartments through to large detached self/custom build plots.</p>
      <p>“The site will be marketed in multiple phases, including opportunities for smaller builders. </p>
      <p>“A new community hub located in the centre of Coypool Park will provide a café, nursery, small shop and flexible, multi-use space for local clubs, health clinics, classes and parties.</p>
      <p>“The application also allows for a small shop located near the site entrance. </p>
      <p>“Contributions towards investment in healthcare, schools and outdoor sports will be made as the site is built-out.”</p>
      <p>The 30-hectare ‘brownfield’ site of the former China Clay drying works which closed in 2008 is between the suburb of Woodford to the east and the Plym Valley Railway line on the west.</p>
      <p>The site in the city’s Plympton St Mary ward is alongside Woodford Avenue and Coypool Road, which leads to Plymouth Road.  The Coypool park and ride site is to the south and Marsh Mills Retail Park is on the other side of the rail line.</p>
      <p>The statement said: “Walking and cycling routes will be established to existing communities via Woodford Avenue and connection made to the national cycle route at the Drakes Trail.</p>
      <p>“This will connect new and existing residents to vast recreation routes along the Plym Valley as well as walking and cycling routes to Plympton and Plymouth.</p>

      <p>“Links with the existing Park&amp;Ride via the main street will enable people to travel into the city centre by bus conveniently.”</p>
      <p>The outline planning application to Plymouth City Council sets out a masterplan for the site and covers issues including access.</p>
      <p>The detailed design and layout will be covered by a later application if the outline scheme is approved.</p>
      <p>The Government’s housing delivery agency Homes England bought the site from two landowners to prepare it for redevelopment.</p>
