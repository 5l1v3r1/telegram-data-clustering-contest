      <h1>Santrokofi and Akpafu traditional councils bid for SALL District capital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:59:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Williams, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Santrokofi (O/R), Dec. 09, GNA - The Santrokofi and Akpafu traditional councils of the Santrokofi, Akpafu, Lolobi and Likpe (SALL) communities of the Oti Region have put in a joint bid for the siting of the District Capital for the proposed SALL District at Santrokofi-Gbodome.</p>
      <p>This followed a "careful and objective" assessment of the four traditional areas within the SALL enclave, Nana Tetteh Kalai III, Benkumhene of Santrokofi said at a News conference at Santrokofi-Gbodome.</p>
      <p>He said the reasons for the choice of Santrokofi-Gbodome as the preferred capital was due to accessibility and convenience of reach by all the four traditional areas.Â </p>
      <p>"A cursory look at the map of SALL is evidenced of the fact that for instance, it takes a shorter travel time due to a shorter distance to travel from Likpe to Santrokofi-Gbodome, than from Likpe to Lolobi and also Lolobi or Akpafu to Santrokofi is shorter than to Likpe," Nana Kalai said.</p>
      <p>He said Santrokofi-Gbodome had adequate accommodation for office and residential purposes, adding that a vast parcel of land of about 10 acres was donated by some patriots of the town to be used for construction of permanent physical structures should the town win the bid for the capital.</p>
      <p>Nana Kalai said it was the considered opinion that Santrokofi-Gbodome as District capital would boost socio-economic activities in the District since the town was along the Eastern Corridor road, intended to serve as a major link between the north and south of the country.</p>
      <p>He said the quest for the creation of the SALL District was ultimately to promote socio-economic development and to enhance administrative efficiency of the area and beckoned the natives to support the idea.</p>
      <p>Nana Kalai said it was important to seize the opportunity presented by the creation of the Oti Region to refine ideas, listen to one another and build consensus in order to facilitate the development of the area devoid of parochial and selfish interest.</p>
      <p>He said with the hope of a "promising and prosperous SALL District," it was important for all to come on board to open up the area for rapid growth.</p>
      <p>Nana Kalai also said should Santrokofi-Gbodome be considered for the siting of the District capital, it would serve as the 'mixing bowl' for prosperous district since it was one of the peaceful and harmonious traditional areas within the SALL enclave.</p>
      <p>Gbosate Afrifa Akwamoa, Akpafu Manhene said the Akpafu traditional council was ready and had supported the siting of the District capital in Santrokofi-Gbodome adding that the traditional area was ready to also donate land for the construction of offices.</p>
      <p>Nana Kalai III told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that a formal petition was sent to the President through the Minister for Local Government and Rural Development.</p>
      <p>He said although they were hopeful and sure that Santrokofi-Gbodome would be chosen by the President, they would be peaceful and respect any decision by the President.</p>
