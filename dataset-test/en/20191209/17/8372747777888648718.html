      <p>SAN CARLOS PARK, Fla. â€” The San Carlos Park Fire Department was dispatched to a residence on Love Road.</p>
      <p>Crews on scene observed smoke showing from the eaves of a 2-story home.</p>
      <p>It was unknown if the home was occupied and due to that circumstance crews made forcible entry into the home and performed two complete searches.</p>
      <p>No occupants, human or animal, were located during either search.</p>
      <p>The fire was confined to the utility room while the entire house suffered smoke damage.</p>
      <p>The owner of the home arrived while crews were on-scene and confirmed no one was home at the time of the fire.</p>
      <p>The Fire Marshal determined the cause of the fire to be accidental.</p>
      <p>The fire is believed to have started in the utility closet which contained the water heater, air handler, washer and dryer.</p>
      <p>It appears the water heater lines were damaged by the fire and spilling water from those lines kept the fire from spreading.</p>
      <p>The home is uninhabitable, three adults were displaced.</p>
