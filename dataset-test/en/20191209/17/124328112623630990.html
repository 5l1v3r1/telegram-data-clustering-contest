      <p>Hilarious footage shows a woman bring down a restaurant ceiling - with an egg. </p>
      <p>The customer was invited to try a trick at the teppanyaki restaurant Hanahana in Newcastle, which involved flipping an egg into the chef's hat she was wearing. </p>
      <p>However, call centre worker Claire Logan, 30, manages to propel the egg straight into the ceiling causing a metal panel to fall down.</p>
      <p>As part of the ceiling lands on top of the griddle, she and the chef are showered in debris and egg much to the amusement of the other diners sitting nearby.</p>
      <p>Summer Sharp, 19, from Hartlepool, County Durham, was filming the high jinks at the Japanese restaurant where food is cooked on a hot plate in front of customers.</p>

      <p>Ms Sharp, who works with Ms Logan, captioned her post: 'Can't cope with Claire trying to flip and egg and bringing the full ceiling down hahahahaha.'</p>
      <p>Ms Logan can be seen preparing to toss a whole egg in the air using a spatula and, hopefully, catching it in her chef's hat.</p>
      <p>The teppanyaki chef shows her the theatrics surrounding the trick, telling her she needs to hit her spatula off the griddle before tossing the egg up.</p>
      <p>Ms Logan then gets counted down by other customers.</p>
      <p>When the countdown ends, she tosses the egg up into the air using the spatula.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately however, she tosses it too hard. This results in the egg exploding off the ceiling, sending egg everywhere and bringing down a section of the ceiling in the process.</p>
      <p>The silver panel hits the griddle in front of the customers, thankfully avoiding everyone.</p>
      <p>Ms Sharp and other customers are heard laughing hysterically as the video ends.</p>
      <p>Speaking today, Ms Sharp said: 'Before the egg flip, everyone else flipped their own egg and caught it in their hats.</p>

      <p>'Then Claire flipped hers, missed her hat completely, hit the roof and it came down. </p>
      <p>'After that the people who worked in Hanahana put the roof back up somehow and we all carried on eating and drinking.' </p>
      <p>Since posting the video, the clip has attracted four million views and over 300,000 likes. </p>
