      <h1>John Greenacre obituary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:56:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/Hugh%20Brett" target="_blank">Hugh Brett</a></address>
      <p>My cousin John Greenacre, who has died aged 85, was a renowned teacher. He was totally committed to <a href="https://www.peterhouse.co.zw/">Peterhouse school</a>, near Marondera, Zimbabwe, where he recorded 56 years of service. He taught maths and coached tennis and cricket. He also led safaris to the Kalahari desert and Chimanimani national park.</p>
      <p>Although John was born in Putney, south-west London, his family had long been based in Durban, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica">South Africa</a>. It was there that his father, Kenneth – an RAF pilot during the second world war – was director of the family department store, Greenacre’s. His mother, Elizabeth (nee Brett), was a devoted wife and mother.</p>
      <p>He was educated at Michaelhouse school in Natal, and then Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics. He joined Peterhouse in 1959 following an invitation from Fred Snell, a former head teacher at Michaelhouse. Snell’s ambition was to establish a school in Rhodesia, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> was then called, which would reflect the best of British educational traditions.</p>
      <p>John was active in helping the development of the school right from the beginning of his time there. He participated in the building of the chapel and, more recently, a magnificent library. John was proud of the school’s unique safari park with its giraffes, zebra, wildebeest and antelopes.</p>
      <p>Peterhouse was originally attended by children from the expatriate community, but John encouraged a policy of accepting Zimbabwean pupils. Inevitably, he met with some complaints, but today the school is 90% Zimbabwean.</p>
      <p>The vicious guerrilla war of the 1970s affected many in the school, but John remained dedicated to Peterhouse. As a housemaster he often had the difficult task of counselling traumatised pupils.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/robert-mugabe-obituary">Robert Mugabe</a>’s government was averse to any form of perceived racism and John’s tact and experience helped to diffuse volatile situations. When a colleague from Britain replaced two Zimbabwean teachers it led to a storm of protest, which reached government levels. John played a discreet role in helping to ease such misunderstandings.</p>
      <p>He lived in a small, sparsely furnished bungalow. His extravagance was a glass (or two) of J&amp;B whisky in the evening and an upmarket car – originally an E-Type Jaguar – which delighted the boys and proved useful for visiting his Durban relations.</p>
      <p>John is buried in the Peterhouse cemetery. His sister Angela Mai survives him.</p>
