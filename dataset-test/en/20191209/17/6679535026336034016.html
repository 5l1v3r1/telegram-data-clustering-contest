      <h1>Ranji Trophy: A day of intense drama and action</h1>
      <h2>Karnataka makes the most of a horrendous fielding display by Tamil Nadu</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:24:08+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-Dinakar-226/" target="_blank">S. Dinakar</a></address>
      <p>Catches were dropped, appeals came to nothing, and raw emotions swept the arena. Two old rivals slugged it out on a bright, sunny Monday of heat and dust.</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu picked four spinners, expecting to bowl last on a dry surface, but ended up losing the toss. It had to regroup. And, Karnataka progressed to 259 for six on day one of this Ranji contest at the NPR ground.</p>
      <h3>Padikkal’s luck</h3>
      <p>The left-handed Devdutt Padikkal displayed glimpses of promise — the lanky batsman leaned into his cover drives, and cut with panache — during his 182-ball 78 (7x4).</p>
      <p>He also was immensely lucky. He was dropped on 2 (at point off Vijay Shankar), on 7 (a sitter at short-cover off R. Ashwin) and on 64 (a dolly at mid-on off M. Ashwin) — all by debutant M. Siddharth.</p>
      <p>In fact, R. Ashwin, who bowled with rhythm and control, had set Padikkal up with two shorter deliveries and then drew him forward and got him to miscue by getting the ball to dip.</p>
      <p>Siddharth dropped three catches and discovered there was no place to hide on a cricket field. Creditably, he still sent down his left-arm spin with zip. The lanky lad had the well-settled Mayank Agarwal (43) nicking a delivery that spun away.</p>
      <p>Late in the day, despite the mental pounding, he turned one from middle to off to castle B.R. Sharath.</p>
      <p>And the parsimonious Ashwin, who bowled a probing 16-over spell before lunch, created the pressure.</p>
      <p>Karnataka captain Karun Nair worked Ashwin to short mid-wicket and set off. Vijay Shankar swooped on the ball and bowler Ashwin did the rest. A massive blow it was.</p>
      <p>Padikkal and Pawan Deshpande, the two left-handers, added 116 for the fourth wicket with some enterprising strokes and slices of good fortune before occasional spinner B. Aparajith’s change of pace extracted a miscue from Padikkal.</p>
      <p>Between strokes of authority, Deshpande (65, 142b, 6x4) survived a string of appeals from R. Ashwin before the wily off-spinner had the southpaw caught behind.</p>
      <h3>Painful blow</h3>
      <p>Fielding close in, Abhinav Mukund took a painful blow on his chest and left the ground. Paceman K. Vignesh castled opener D. Nischal with a nippy incoming delivery but suffered a bout of vomiting.</p>
      <p>
