      <h1>Report: West Ham have considered Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland</h1>

      <p>West Ham United have reportedly considered making a move for Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6513370-exclusive-west-ham-open-talks-with-middlesbrough-over-darren-randolph-transfer">According to a report from 90min</a>, the Hammers gave thought to making a move for the Championship stopper following the struggles of Lukasz Fabianski’s deputy Roberto.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has made an awful start to his London Stadium career after signing in the summer, and has already lost his place in the starting XI to David Martin.</p>

      <p>His long-term future at the club is already looking bleak, and 90min say the club have opened talks with Middlesbrough over Darren Randolph.</p>
      <p>But they also claim Butland has been discussed, but the club have been ‘unable to move away’ from their former stopper.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Butland a long-term acquisition</h3>
      <p>Butland has not been in particularly good form for struggling Stoke, but could be a good pickup by West Ham, who will need a ‘keeper for the long-term soon.</p>

      <p>It sounds as though the club are more keen to re-sign Randolph following his £5 million departure in 2017 (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40690832">BBC Sport</a>).</p>
      <p>He would be an upgrade on Roberto, but the club would then have three ageing goalkeepers – perhaps the 26-year-old Butland, who does have nine England caps, shouldn’t be discounted.</p>
