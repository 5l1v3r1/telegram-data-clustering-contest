      <p>The Bundesliga giants have recorded five successive victories in Group B, which has given them an unassailable lead over their next opponents.</p>
      <p>However, with Bayern having suffered two straight defeats in Germany's top flight, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hans-flick/"><b>Hans Flick</b></a> may take the opportunity to rest players against the Premier League outfit.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> predicts how the Bavarians may line up for the fixture at the Allianz Arena.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niklas-sule/"><b>Niklas Sule</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-hernandez/"><b>Lucas Hernandez</b></a> (ankle), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fiete-arp/"><b>Fiete Arp</b></a> (arm), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mickael-cuisance/"><b>Mickael Cuisance</b></a> (foot)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/corentin-tolisso/"><b>Corentin Tolisso</b></a> (thigh), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jerome-boateng/"><b>Jerome Boateng</b></a> (calf)</p>
      <p>Despite having sustained calf and thigh issues against Borussia Monchengladbach at the weekend, Jerome Boateng and Corentin Tolisso should be available for this fixture.</p>
      <p>However, having been in line to start against Spurs, Mickael Cuisance has been ruled out after picking up a foot injury.</p>
      <p>The absence of the Frenchman could lead to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joshua-kimmich/"><b>Joshua Kimmich</b></a>, Tolisso and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/philippe-coutinho/"><b>Philippe Coutinho</b></a> forming a three-man midfield, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ivan-perisic/"><b>Ivan Perisic</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kingsley-coman/"><b>Kingsley Coman</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/serge-gnabry/"><b>Serge Gnabry</b></a> being used further forward.</p>
      <p>That would allow <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thiago/"><b>Thiago</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leon-goretzka/"><b>Leon Goretzka</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robert-lewandowski/"><b>Robert Lewandowski</b></a> to drop down to the substitutes' bench ahead of Saturday's meeting with Werder Bremen.</p>
      <p>Due to being sidelined through suspension at the weekend, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/javi-martinez/"><b>Javi Martinez</b></a> should feature at the back, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/benjamin-pavard/"><b>Benjamin Pavard</b></a> coming into the starting lineup at right-back.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sven-ulreich/"><b>Sven Ulreich</b></a> is expected to take the place of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/manuel-neuer/"><b>Manuel Neuer</b></a> between the sticks.</p>
