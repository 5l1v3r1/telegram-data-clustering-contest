      <p><b>LONDON — </b>Arsenal scored three goals in nine second-half minutes as they came from a goal down to beat West Ham United 3-1 away on Monday to end a seven-match winless run in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Hammers took the lead seven minutes before the break, with Angelo Ogbonna charging into a crowded box to head home a Pablo Fornals cross at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>But Arsenal, with interim coach Freddie Ljungberg searching for his first win since taking over from the sacked Unai Emery, equalised on the hour thanks to a sharp finish from Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli, his first Premier League goal.</p>
      <p>Six minutes later record signing Nicolas Pepe put the visitors ahead with a superb curling shot into the far corner before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang volleyed home a Pepe cross.</p>
      <p>West Ham suffered a third straight home loss which leaves them in 16th on 16 points, just a point above the relegation zone. Arsenal moved up to ninth on 22 points from 16 games.</p>
