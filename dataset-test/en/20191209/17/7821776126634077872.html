      <p>Electric scooter start-up Unicorn is shutting down after spending too much money on Facebook adverts.</p>
      <p>Customers received an email from founder Nick Evans, saying he was "very sorry" and was trying to sell Unicorn's assets to offer partial refunds.</p>
      <p>The Texas-based company sold just 350 of its $699 (Â£531) commuter scooters, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/7/21000094/unicorn-electric-scooter-shut-down-refund-tile">The Verge</a>. They have a top speed of 15mph and a range of 15 miles.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/unicornrides#section-overview">start-up tracker Crunchbase</a> said Unicorn had raised just $150,000.</p>
      <p>"It saddens me to write this letter but we have run out of funding and are shutting down operations immediately," the email says.</p>
      <p>"We unfortunately do not have the resources to deliver your Unicorns nor are we able to provide refunds, as we are completely out of funding."</p>
      <p>The cost of "Facebook and Google ads, payments for loans, and other expenses" ate through the company's funding quicker than Mr Evans anticipated.</p>
      <p>"A large proportion of the revenue went toward paying for Facebook ads to bring traffic to the site," the email says.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately the cost of the ads were just too expensive to build a sustainable business."</p>
      <p>"This is infuriating and I am not happy with this company," customer Juliette Lopez wrote on Facebook.</p>
      <p>And Rebecca Buchholtz wrote she was "heartbroken" after receiving the email as she had ordered her daughter a scooter for Christmas</p>
      <p>The company has not posted on Facebook or Instagram since 20 June.</p>
      <p>However, four weeks ago it wrote <a href="https://unicornrides.com/pages/unicorn-shipping-update">on its website</a> it was on track to ship scooters on 15 December, adding customers would have their orders in time for Christmas and Hanukkah.</p>
      <p>Though popular around the world, electric scooters are illegal to use on UK roads and pavements.</p>
