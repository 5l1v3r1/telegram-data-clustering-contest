      <p>“We actually already know the whole story to [Wonder Woman 3] and then some because there is an Amazon [spin-off] movie, as well, and so we already have it all mapped out,” Jenkins told reporters, according to<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=58287X1516327&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fmovies%2F2019%2F12%2F09%2Fwonder-woman-3-amazons-spinoff-patty-jenkins%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2019%2F12%2Fwonder-woman-1984-gal-gadot-patty-jenkins-interview-ccxp-amazon-movie-inclusion-representation-diversity-feminism-women-1202804180%2F&amp;xguid=&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=480&amp;xuuid=e030cdcbd3b0580bd4edafdaf1230746"><i> Deadline</i></a>. “It’s just a matter of will we change our minds and when.”</p>

      <p>“I think what we don’t want to do is do it back to back,” she continued. “It’s been great doing these two movies back to back, but I think it’s important to give it a little rest in between — and I like doing other things in between. And Gal has other things to do. I never want to make decisions too far in advance. We have to see if we both feel like making the movie we think we want to make when the moment comes.”</p>
      <p>Jenkins released “Wonder Woman” in 2017 and the highly anticipated sequel is due June 4, 2020.</p>
