        <b>Ethan Klein, who has over two million subscribers on his YouTube channel H3 Podcast, has caused a storm on social media with his take on the K-pop phenomenon and its brightest stars, the boy band BTS. As a “cancel” campaign against him trends Twitter, his colleague from Sweden, who has a history of dealing with racism scandals, has not stayed out.</b>

      <p>​Klein, better known online as h3h3productions, has faced backlash over a monologue in one of his podcasts, in which he does not “get” K-pop and its idols, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201912061077495151-2019-mama-highlights-bts-record-9-awards-best-performances-and-got7-jacksons-meme-face/">BTS</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“How did this become a thing in western culture? All grown men and little girls are jerking off to little k-pop boys. It’s like a little fetish, a little twink gay fetish about these k-pop boys”, he said.</blockquote>

      <p>The video prompted an avalanche of critical comments, as some branded his assumption racist. Many shared their contempt under the hashtag #h3h3isoverparty, which is now trending on Twitter.</p>

      <p>​Klein decided to fight back against the accusations, as well, and shamed K-pop fans for overreacting to his joke.</p>
      <blockquote>“Lighten up nerds, if you can't handle your hobby being made fun of a little bit then you are really are just a bunch of little girls jerking off to kpop boys”, he tweeted, also blaming K-pop stans for their idols’ suicides.</blockquote>
