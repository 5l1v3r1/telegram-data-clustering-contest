      <p>Aizawl FC overcame a spirited young Indian Arrows 2-1 to register their first win of the 13th Hero I-League season at the Tilak Maidan here on Monday.</p>
      <p>The visitors from Mizoram rode on strikes from William Lalnunfela (64th minute) and Joe Zoherliana (90+4) to snatch a dramatic victory in the stoppage time after Vikram Partap Singh had equalised for the hosts in the 81st minute.</p>
      <p>On a quest for their first win, both sides kicked-off the proceedings with an intent to press hard.</p>
      <p>The young Arrows, in the initial minutes, exhibited neat passes and structured movement. Aizawl, on the other hand, displayed fine defensive solidarity, with Juuko Kassaga being a towering figure throughout the game, constantly frustrating the likes of Vikram and Harmanpreet.</p>
      <p>In the 31st minute, a beautifully lobbed pass by Rochharzela was chested down by Abdoulaye Kanoute with exquisite control and the Malian forward had a crack on goal but was denied in spectacular fashion by Samik Mitra.</p>
      <p>Minutes before the break, a miscued headed clearance by Ajin Tom fell to the feet of Kanoute but he squandered the golden opportunity to put Aizawl ahead, as his effort went wide off the mark.</p>
      <p>In the second half, the Arrows nearly found an opening when Vikram was seemingly brought down by Kassaga inside the box, but referee Rosario Fernandes waved away all appeals for a penalty.</p>
      <p>However, it was Aizawl who took the lead in the 64th minute. In an attempt to clear a cross from Isak Vanlalruatfela, Saurabh Meher deflected the delivery to the path of William Lalnunfela, and the substitute made no mistake tapping it in.</p>
      <p>Venkatesh’s side displayed great character and started dictating the tempo of the game. They were duly rewarded when a beautifully plotted run by Vikram led to him being through on goal and he made no mistake in earning a well-deserved equaliser for the Arrows.</p>
      <p>However, all of Indian Arrows’ good work was undone. With four minutes added on, Aizawl continued to overload the final third.</p>
      <p>Lalnunfela broke through on the right inside the Arrows’ box and delivered a measured cross which was met by a leaping Joe Zoherliana with his head, to seal a dramatic 2-1 win for Stanley Rozario’s side.</p>
      <p>With the victory, Aizawl move to third place in the Hero I-League table with four points while Indian Arrows remain at the bottom with two losses from as many games.</p>
      <p>Arrows goalkeeper Samik Mitra was adjudged to be the Hero of the Match for his calm and confident display under the woodwork.</p>
      <p>Indian Arrows will now face former champions Punjab FC on December 16, while Aizawl FC will host reigning champions Chennai City FC on December 17.</p>
