      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- The $120,000 banana duct taped to the wall of a Florida art gallery was taken off the wall and eaten by a visitor -- and another visitor then replaced it with graffiti about <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jeffrey_Epstein/?tps=1">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>David Datuna, a performance artist based in New York, posted a video showing the moment he <a href="https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/man-eats-$120k-banana-from-installation-at-miami-art-exhibit/5740798/">took the banana down</a> from the wall at Art Basel Miami Beach and ate the pricey fruit.</p>
      <p>Datuna was escorted out of the gallery by security and officials said they don't plan to pursue any charges.</p>
      <p>The duct-taped banana, titled <i>The Comedian</i>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2019/12/06/Banana-duct-taped-to-wall-sells-for-120000-at-Florida-gallery/9971575665161/?upi_ss=banana">was a piece by Italian artist</a> Maurizio Cattelan. It was the one remaining edition of the work after two others sold for $120,000 each.</p>
      <p>The wall formerly occupied by the banana was <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/visual-arts/art-basel/article238176479.html">targeted by another visitor</a> to the gallery Sunday when a man was recorded using red lipstick to write "Epstien didn't kill himself," a misspelled reference to theories about the <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/19/Prosecutors-charge-2-NYC-guards-on-duty-during-Jeffrey-Epsteins-death/6981574185655/">recent death of accused sex trafficker</a> Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Roderick Webber, 46, was arrested on charges of criminal mischief.</p>
      <p>Webber's writing was covered up by a piece of white cardboard and a new banana was taped to the wall. Officials said guards are being posted near the piece to prevent further incidents.</p>
