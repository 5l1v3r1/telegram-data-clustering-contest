      <h1>I-League: Punjab faces an uphill task against CCFC</h1>
      <h2>The latter eyes its second consecutive victory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:35:06+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Defending champion Chennai City FC will look to notch up its second consecutive win of the season when it takes on Punjab FC in an I-League clash here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Chennai City has played only one match and won 1-0 at home against TRAU FC. The team will look to step up a few gears to find the killer instinct in front of the goal.</p>
      <h3>Learning curve</h3>
      <p>Head coach Akbar Nawas said: “We have to improve our game in every match we play. It’s always a learning curve for us.”</p>
      <p>Punjab FC has just one point from its opening two fixtures, having lost 3-0 to Churchill Brothers, followed by a 1-1 draw against East Bengal at home.</p>
      <p>It led East Bengal for most part of the game, only to be denied three points by a late equaliser from Juan Mera.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to hosting the holder, head coach Yan Law said, “we had a fantastic game against East Bengal and we dominated the entire game. We created many chances and unfortunately could not convert them.</p>
      <p>“The late equaliser wasn’t expected as our defence was rock solid in the entire game.”</p>
      <p>“The boys are confident about the next game against Chennai City FC. We are not going to make the same mistakes we made in the previous matches.”</p>
