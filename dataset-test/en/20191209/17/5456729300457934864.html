      <p>“In addition, eye examinations would be conducted in partnership with the National Optometric Association (NOA) , to ensure that only drivers with good eyesight are allowed to drive passengers during the Yuletide.”</p>
      <p>The agency called on motorists traveling during this period to be extra careful and ensure their journeys are properly planned, with their vehicles routinely serviced.</p>

      <p>The Sector Commander, Clement Oladele, on his part urged motorists to imbibe the theme of this year’s Special Patrol Operations of ” Road Safety is a state of mind, traffic crash is an absence of mind – stay safe , stay alert.”</p>
      <p>He warned that any motorist apprehended flouting traffic rules during the Yuletide may be treated as driving dangerously and could be prosecuted.</p>
      <p>“The FRSC has concluded arrangements with the Ogun State Judiciary to intensify the conduct of mobile courts during the Yuletide to support the Special Patrol Operations across the road corridors in Ogun State’.</p>
      <p>“The FRSC Ogun State Command, as customary would provide timely traffic situation on corridors across Ogun State, to guide motorists in having seamless travel experience. This would be through social media and in conjunction with the print and electronic media’</p>
