      <h1>Google’s ARCore Depth API enables AR depth maps and occlusion with one camera</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:00:14+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/jeremy/" target="_blank">Jeremy Horwitz</a></address>
      <p>Android augmented reality is about to take some nice steps forward today, as Google is <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/arcore/">adding</a> a major new feature to its <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/15/arcore-1-7-adds-augmented-faces-object-animations-and-ui-elements/">ARCore toolkit for developers</a>: a Depth API capable of creating depth maps with a single device camera. Rather than requiring differential data gathered from two cameras or a dedicated time of flight sensor, the new Depth API will automatically snap multiple images as you move a single camera around and then compare the images to estimate your distance from each pixel.</p>
      <p>Alone, that feature would be impressive, but Google’s intended use of the API is even better: occlusion, a trick by which digital objects can appear to be overlapped by real-world objects, blending the augmented and real worlds more seamlessly than with mere AR overlays. Starting today, occlusion is available in <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/07/arcores-environment-hdr-mode-uses-ai-to-mimic-real-world-lighting/">Scene Viewer</a> — a Google developer tool for AR in Search — to over 200 million Android devices with ARCore.</p>

      <p>There are myriad potential applications of proper depth-mapping and occlusion in AR, and Google is already suggesting how some of them will work, including an updated <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/23/houzz-raises-400-million-doubling-valuation-to-4-3-billion/">Houzz app</a> that better places digital sample furniture models in real-world spaces and demos that can sense real surfaces and objects to enable digital objects to interact with and bounce off of them.</p>
      <p>While the Depth API is supporting single-camera devices without conventional depth sensors, it’s also anticipating that time-of-flight sensors will enable even faster, dynamic occlusion that will be able to hide parts of digital objects behind real moving objects. The <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/13/apple-invests-390-million-in-company-that-makes-vcsel-depth-sensing-chips-for-iphone-x/">last three generations of iPhones</a> have included front-facing depth sensors, certain recent <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/20/samsungs-galaxy-s10-5g-debuts-with-a-6-7-inch-screen-and-3d-cameras/">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/24/lg-g8-v50-g8s-thinq/">LG</a> devices have started to add time-of-flight rear cameras, and other companies are expected to follow their lead in 2020.</p>
      <p>Developers interested in getting access to the new Depth API will need to respond to Google’s <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/arcore/">call for collaborators</a>, as the software apparently isn’t being made generally available to everyone quite yet. Users can see the new features in action in the latest release of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.houzz.app&amp;hl=en_US">Houzz app for Android</a>, available in the Play Store.</p>
