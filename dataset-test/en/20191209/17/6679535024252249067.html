      <p>India clinched 42 medals, including 27 gold, on the penultimate day of competitions to inch closer to 300-mark and be poised to finish on top for the 13th time on the trot in the South Asian Games.</p>
      <p>Indian athletes won 12 silver and 3 bronze to end Day 8 with 294 medals (159 gold, 91 silver and 44 gold) and be far ahead of Sri Lanka (236) and host Nepal (195 medals).</p>
      <p>With just a few events — including seven boxing finals — scheduled for the closing day on Tuesday, India is unlikely to cross the 309 total medals it won in the last edition at home in 2016.</p>
      <p>India has topped every edition of the Games since inception in 1984.</p>
      <p>Boxers gave India the maximum medals on Monday with six gold and one silver.</p>
      <p>Ankit Khatana (men’s 75kg), Vinod Tanwar (men’s 49kg), Sachin (men’s 56kg), Gaurav Chauhan (men’s 91kg), Kalaivani Srinivasan (women’s 48kg) and Parveen (women’s 60kg) bagged a gold each while Manish Kaushik (men’s 64kg) settled for silver on the first day of the finals.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Vikas Krishan (men’s 69kg), Narender (men’s +91kg), Sparsh (men’s 52kg), Varinder (men’s 60kg), Pinki Rani (women’s 51kg), Sonia Lather (women’s 57kg) and Manju Bamboriya (women’s 64kg) will fight in the finals.</p>
      <p>In wrestling, Indians won both the gold medals on offer on Monday with Gaurav Baliyan and Anita Sheoran registering comfortable victories in men’s 74kg and women’s 68kg respectively to complete a stupendous show. With the successes on Monday, India made a whitewash with seven gold medals each in men’s and women’s events.</p>
      <p>In shooting, India won the air pistol mixed event event through the pair of Anuraj Singha and Shrawan Kumar.</p>
