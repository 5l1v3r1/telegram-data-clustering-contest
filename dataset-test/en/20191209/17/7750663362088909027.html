      <p>Phillips missed Saturday's 2-0 win at Huddersfield as he served a one-match suspension for collecting five yellow cards this season.</p>
      <p>Boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcelo-bielsa/"><b>Marcelo Bielsa</b></a> has confirmed skipper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/liam-cooper/"><b>Liam Cooper</b></a> will be sidelined for a second successive match with a calf strain.</p>
      <p>Cooper joins midfielders <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamie-shackleton/"><b>Jamie Shackleton</b></a> (muscular), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-forshaw/"><b>Adam Forshaw</b></a> (hip) and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tyler-roberts/"><b>Tyler Roberts</b></a> (hamstring) in the treatment room.</p>
      <p>Hull head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/grant-mccann/"><b>Grant McCann</b></a> may opt for an unchanged line-up following a strong showing from his side in Saturday's 2-1 home win over Stoke.</p>
      <p>It is understood McCann has no fresh injury concerns from the match, nor are any players due back from the treatment room in time for the trip across Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Although striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/josh-magennis/"><b>Josh Magennis</b></a>' hamstring injury was not as serious as first thought, he is not due back until after this weekend at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Fellow striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/norbert-balogh/"><b>Norbert Balogh</b></a> is working his way back from a calf injury, while midfielders <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jon-toral/"><b>Jon Toral</b></a> (knee) and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kevin-stewart/"><b>Kevin Stewart</b></a> (foot) are long-term absentees.</p>
