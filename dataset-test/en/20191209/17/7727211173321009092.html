      <h1>Forgotten Liverpool loanee heads back to Merseyside to resolve future as latest loan deal expires</h1>
      <h2>Brazilian midfielder Allan Rodrigues de Souza has had six loan spells since signing for the Anfield side and the latest one has just come to an end.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:50:13+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/matt-addison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Allan Rodrigues de Souza is travelling back to Merseyside to sort out his future after his loan deal with Fluminense came to an end at the end of the Brazilian league season yesterday.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/player-says-hes-travelling-england-solve-liverpool-situation-i-hope-works/">Sport Witness</a> , Allan said to Canal Flu News: "I really want to stay [at Fluminese]. In fact, today I’m traveling to England to solve the process and we will see what will happen. I hope it works out."</p>
      <p>Turning 23 in March, the Brazilian has been out on loan ever since the Reds brought him to Merseyside back in 2015 for around half a million pounds from Internacional.</p>
      <p>After loan spells with Seinäjoki, St. Truiden, Hertha Berlin, Apollon Limassol and Eintracht Frankfurt, Allan was sent to his home country on a temporary deal back in February, initially to the end of the season, before it was extended to December over the summer.</p>
      <p>Fluminense are keen to keep the midfielder but felllow Rio de Janeiro side Flamengo are also reportedly interested in his signature.</p>
      <p>With no appearances at senior level for Liverpool and seemingly no solution to work permit problems having presented itself, Allan could be set to seal a permanent transfer, although another loan is an option for the player.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-confirm-allan-rodrigues-de-16516088">In April, he said:</a> "I would stay [at Fluminense] for two or three years but it does not depend on me alone. I hope there’s an agreement with Fluminense to stay a little longer."</p>
      <p>Allan signed a new contract with Liverpool back in July 2018 but does not appear to be any closer to an appearance under <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a>. His next move, though, should be about to become a little clearer in the coming days and weeks.</p>
