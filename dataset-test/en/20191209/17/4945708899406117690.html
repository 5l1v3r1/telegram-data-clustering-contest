      <h1>Will Apple kill off the Lightning charging port on its iPhones?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:37:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Dalvin Brown, Usa Today</a></address>
      <p>First, Apple "killed" headphone jacks in 2016, then Touch ID fingerprint scanning went away in 2017 with the iPhone X. Could the lightning cable be next to go?</p>
      <p>The iPhone giant is reportedly planning to launch a high-end smartphone in 2021 without a charging cable <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/port/">port</a>, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who works at TF Securities. Kuo has gained a lot of respect in the tech community for nailing predictions of previous Apple products.</p>
      <p>The future iPhone will supposedly offer a "completely wireless experience," Kuo said in a research note obtained by MacRumors.</p>
      <p>Removing the charging port means the device would require wireless charging and may allow iPhones to be more water-resistant. It would mean iPhones are moving one step closer to looking like a flat sheet of glass, an ambitious vision held by Apple's previous head of design Jony Ive, who left the company over the summer.</p>
      <p>Apple will get rid of the charging port to "create more differentiation between the highest-end and high-end models," Kuo predicts." The brand's latest iPhones support fast charging, which "gives you a quick and convenient way to recharge your iPhone 8 or later...up to 50 percent in 30 minutes," according to Apple's website.</p>
      <p>Apple doesn't respond to rumors, however the move would align with what the tech company is known for.</p>
      <p>Apple has long gotten rid of ports and smartphone features to make iPhones appear thinner and sleeker. The tech behemoth first got rid of its wide, 30-pin dock charger in 2012. And many users were upset when it decided to nuke the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/headphone+jack/">headphone jack</a> with the iPhone 7 and later models.</p>
      <p>The original home button has been gone for years now, and its replacement, the fingerprint scanner, is also in the grave.</p>
