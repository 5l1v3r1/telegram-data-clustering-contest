      <p>A mother accused of supplying the drugs which killed her schoolboy son has accused her ex-partner of bribing the 15-year-old’s friends to tell lies about her.</p>
      <p>Holly Strawbridge, aged 34, told police that teenagers were making up things abut her because they were being given money by Tyler Peck’s father.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-five Strawbridge is on on trial accused of giving Tyler and a 15-year-old friend her <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/devon-mum-joined-15-year-3604184">morphine and other painkilling medication at the family home in Salcombe.</a></p>
      <p>Tyler Peck died from an overdose in his sleep that February night.</p>
      <p>The trial resumed today after being adjourned on Friday after Strawbridge learnt of the<a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/trial-mum-accused-supplying-drugs-3616057"> unexpected death of her own mother.</a></p>
      <p>The jury today heard the police interview Strawbridge gave in June.</p>

      <p>She was asked why Tyler’s friends had lied about her supplying drugs – particularly the 15-year-old who said they spent the early hours abusing her medication.</p>
      <p>He said that the three of them had also sniffed from aerosols.</p>
      <p>Tyler died from an overdose of morphine and Gabapentin, with Valium, codeine and MDMA also found in his system.</p>
      <p>Asked why the 15-year-old and other friends were lying about her, Strawbridge blamed ex-partner Ryan Peck.</p>
      <p>She added: “He is a man who can get to them. He is probably giving them all money.”</p>
      <p>Asked what money she was talking about, she said that it was £3,000 raised for Tyler’s funeral.</p>
      <p>Officer in the case DC Mike Lugger asked Strawbridge: “Can you give me anything concrete? This would be perverting the course of justice.”</p>

      <p>Strawbridge replied: “I have just given you it.”</p>
      <p>She had earlier denied supplying the two 15-year-olds or anyone else with drugs.</p>
      <p>Strawbridge said: “I just want to say that I have never supplied any sort of drugs. I had nothing to do with Tyler’s death or any allegations that they, people, are saying.”</p>
      <p>She told police in her initial interview that she had put Tyler to sleep that night.</p>
      <p>The court heard a statement from Andy Pugsley, the headteacher of Salcombe Primary School.</p>
      <p>He said that the school decided to set up a crowdfunding page in the wake of Tyler’s death.</p>

      <p>Mr Pugsley added that the aim was to raise £1,500 to pay for the funeral, but £3,000 was collected.</p>
      <p>He added that the excess money was split between four schools attended by Tyler and his brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has closed its case, but for verifying one fact.</p>
      <p>Strawbridge has pleaded not guilty to supplying Tyler and the other boy with morphine between January 31 and February 3.</p>
      <p>The defendant has also denies two further charges of cruelty towards the two boys between the same dates.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
