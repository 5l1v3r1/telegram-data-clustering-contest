      <h1>Jurgen Klopp provides injury update on Liverpool trio ahead of Red Bull Salzburg clash</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool had concerns over Dejan Lovren, Gini Wijnaldum and Adam Lallana ahead of the trip to Austria in the Champions League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T17:41:33+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has confirmed Gini Wijnaldum and Dejan Lovren are fit for Liverpool's clash with Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Reds are in Austria as they look to qualify for the knockout stages of the competition.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> need a point to be sure of their progression and have been boosted by the return to fitness of Lovren and Wijnaldum.</p>
      <p>Lovren was forced off in the first half of the 3-0 win at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on Saturday while Wijnaldum missed the trip with a knock.</p>
      <p>But Klopp insists both are available although Adam Lallana is not expected back in training until the end of the week.</p>
      <p>“Gini and Dejan are completely fine. We had pretty much a free choice apart from Adam," Klopp said.</p>

      <p>"Adam is not coming but will be back in training on Thursday. Under pressure we probably could have used him, but we didn’t want to make pressure. How I said, it’s a small thing.</p>
      <p>“It would have been maybe a risk or not [to consider Lallana against Salzburg], I’m not sure, but we decided to leave him at Melwood and then he can train with the team from Thursday on.</p>
      <p>“He had a proper session today, will have a proper session tomorrow and then Thursday he can be with the team.”</p>

      <p>Klopp also discussed Fabinho and Joel Matip, who are set to be out of action until the turn of the year.</p>
      <p>"Not really, but we didn’t ask really - there is no pressure from my side," Klopp said when asked if there was an update on the pair.</p>
      <p>“It’s clear they will not be in before Christmas; not this year, actually. I know everybody involved is doing whatever they can."</p>
