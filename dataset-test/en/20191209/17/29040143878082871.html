      <p>Every year, Samsung kicks off the year with its Galaxy S devices. These serve as a showcase of the very best that the company has to offer, and this year, we were treated to a total of three new devices with the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e.</p>
      <p>Whether you're looking for the latest news, want to know how the phones compare to other gadgets, need help finding a good case, or anything else in between, you're in the right place.</p>

      <p>Samsung typically releases two Galaxy S phones each year, including its base model and a Plus one with slightly improved specs and a larger screen.</p>
      <p>For 2019, we have the base Galaxy S10, the upgraded Galaxy S10+, and a completely new entry with the Galaxy S10e.</p>
      <p>While the S10 and S10+ are being marketed as Samsung's two main flagships for the year, the S10e is a device that aims to offer a lot of that same experience but for less money (think of it as Samsung's answer to the iPhone XR).</p>
      <p>This is a big change to the usual Galaxy S lineup, and while it could cause for some confusion, it gives customers more choice than before. If you want the best that Samsung has to offer, you get the S10. Want a larger screen, a bigger battery, and two front-facing cameras? The S10+ has you covered. If money's a bit tighter but you still want an excellent Android phone, the S10e is ready to serve you.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Samsung's been making really great phones for the last few years, so if you already own an older Galaxy S flagship, is it worth upgrading to the new S10?</p>
      <p>If you're still rocking a Galaxy S8 or anything older, getting the S10 just makes sense. It'll be a vastly better experience compared to what you're using right now, and if you've held onto your current phone for two or more years, you've definitely gotten your money's worth.</p>
      <p>And honestly, even if you have last year's Galaxy S9, the S10 still delivers meaningful improvements on a few different areas that could make it worth splurging for.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy S10 series gets a lot right. The phones are built well, have gorgeous screens, and incredible processing power.</p>
      <p>So, how does all of that stack up against other smartphones that are on the market? We've taken the time to compare the S10, S10+, and S10e to some of their closest competitors, making it easy for you to choose the device that's right for you.</p>

      <h4>Get familiar with the specs</h4>
      <p>With three different phones being offered this year, that means you have three different spec sheets to familiarize yourself with this year.</p>
      <p>The S10 sits in the middle-ground, the S10+ has the very best specs you can find, and the S10e cuts a few corners to get its price down to where it is.</p>
      <p>It's a pretty simple way to think about things, but if you really want to understand the minute similarities and differences between the three phones, we recommend checking out the full spec list below 👇.</p>
      <p>

      <h4>What's up with those hole-punch displays?</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/02/samsung-galaxy-s10e-yellow-front-3.jpg?itok=NlZKzj5k"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Yep. The rumors were right. Despite its resilience to the notch over the last couple of years, Samsung caved in with the S10 series by using its Infinity-O display that features a hole-punch cutout/notch in the upper-right corner.</p>
      <p>While there are a <i>lot</i> of mixed feelings about this decision, we're glad Samsung made this move.</p>
      <p>For starters, this allows for even more screen real-estate than before. The top and bottom bezels have shrunk quite a bit compared to the S9, giving you even more viewing area for your movies, games, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the displays themselves, they're still rocking Samsung's phenomenal Super AMOLED panels. This year, however, they get a nice upgrade with official support for HDR10+. In other words, if you're watching a video that supports HDR10+, you'll see it with even punchier colors and deeper contrasts.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Speaking of the display, the S10 and S10+ have their fingerprint sensors hidden underneath it.</p>
      <p>Similar to what we've seen on devices like the OnePlus 6T, there's a designated area in the bottom middle of the screen where you can place your finger to unlock the phone. The S10 and S10+ are the first devices to use Qualcomm's ultrasonic sensing technology which essentially creates a 3D model of your fingerprint. Compared to other in-screen sensors that just capture a 2D image of it, this should allow the S10 to be faster and more secure in these regards.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>You know how we've been saying that Samsung has three S10 models to choose from? Yeah, there's a fourth one, too.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S10 5G, in addition to connecting to 5G networks, has a gigantic 6.7-inch display, 4,500 mAh battery, and 25W Super Fast Charging.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in picking up the S10 5G, it's currently available at Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile in the United States. AT&amp;T <i>technically</i> sells the phone, too, but it's only available for business customers and not regular consumers.</p>
      <p>The S10 5G is easily the most expensive phone in the lineup, coming in at a hefty $1300. It does have some nice benefits over the S10+, but we aren't convinced that it's worth the steep price tag — especially when you consider how scattered 5G availability currently is in the U.S.</p>
      <p>However, if you live in a supported market and want to be among the first in the country to tap into the next generation of wireless data, the S10 5G is probably your best bet.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy S10 devices are designed incredibly well, and to compliment that craftsmanship that went into them, Samsung's offering the phones in a variety of gorgeous colors.</p>
      <p>What kind of colors?</p>
      <p>The S10, S10+, and S10e are all available in Prism Black, Prism White, Prism Blue, Flamingo Pink, and Prism Green. The S10+ has two premium Ceramic Black and Ceramic White finishes, whereas the S10e gets a gorgeous Canary Yellow colorway.</p>

      <h4>How much are the phones, and where can you buy them?</h4>
      <p>Samsung has an extensive retail network for its flagship phones, and that means you don't have to look hard to find a place where you can buy any of the new Galaxy S10s. The Galaxy S10e starts at $750, the Galaxy S10 is at $900, and the Galaxy S10+ is $1000. You can add $100-200 to each to add more internal storage, or in the case of the S10+ an exclusive ceramic back.</p>

      <p>In an unexpected move for the company, there's been a lot of talk and chatter about Samsung getting ready to release a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s10-lite-and-note-10-lite-fully-revealed-new-renders">Galaxy S10 Lite</a> before 2019 is over.</p>
      <p>Rumored specs for the S10 Lite include a 6.7-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display, three rear cameras, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 processor. It's also said that the phone will have 8GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage, and a large 4,500 mAh battery that can take advantage of Samsung's 45W wired charging speeds.</p>
      <p>Samsung may hold an event sometime in December to formally unveil the phone, and as we learn more, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
      <h4>It's time to start thinking about the Galaxy S11</h4>

      <p>The Galaxy S10 continues to be a top-tier Android flagship even at this stage in its life cycle, but there's no ignoring the fact that the Galaxy S11 will be here before you know it.</p>
      <p>We're expecting Samsung to launch three models of the S11, including an S11, S11+, and S11e similar to what we saw with the S10 series. Big camera improvements should be the highlight this time around, with the rumor mill pointing towards a 108MP primary camera sensor, impressive low-light performance, 8K video cature at 30 frames-per-second, and a lot more.</p>
      <p>The S11 series is said to make its debut sometime in mid or late February 2020, meaning we don't have too much longer to wait to see what's up Samsung's sleeves.</p>

      <h3>Galaxy S10 news archive</h3>
      <h4>April 18, 2019 — The Galaxy S10's week one sales were 16% higher compared to the S9</h4>
      <p>The Galaxy S10 offers a lot of big improvements over the S9, and thanks to new data from <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-sales-16-higher-last-years-galaxy-s9-series-first-week-us/">Counterpoint Research</a>, it looks like Samsung's upgrades for the S10 series really paid off.</p>
      <p>According to Counterpoint:</p>
      <blockquote>The new S10 series sold 16% more in the first week of its sales compared to last year's sales of the Galaxy S9 series. This is a comparison of sales in the US between March 8th to 14th in 2019 with March 16th to 22nd in 2018.</blockquote>
      <p>Of the three phones Samsung released (the S10, S10+, and S10e), the S10+ accounts for "50% of volumes of the series." Surprisingly, Counterpoint says that the Galaxy S10e is the weakest-selling of the three.</p>
      <p>Despite the S10e being the worst selling of the trio, it's actually the reason Samsung saw an increase in sales compared to last year.</p>
      <blockquote>However, it is the additional S10e volumes that helped Samsung get the gains compared to the S9 series sales. Our data reveals that the combined sales of the S10 Plus and the S10 are similar to that of the S9 Plus and the S9.</blockquote>
      <h4>April 16, 2019 — Sprint rolls out April security update for Galaxy S10 with LTE fixes</h4>
      <p>Sprint has rolled out the latest security patch to the Galaxy S10 series, which includes fixes for LTE reception issues. Galaxy S10 users on Sprint have been complaining about poor reception, and while the carrier rolled out a fix last month, it didn't remedy the problem. The latest update should provide a better solution for those still affected by weak cellular reception.</p>
      <p>The update comes in at 184MB, and is now available for those on Sprint's Galaxy S10e, S10, and S10+.</p>
      <h4>April 12, 2019 — Galaxy S10 update makes the in-screen fingerprint sensor much faster</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-s10-biometrics-update.jpg?itok=F2LqdsR4"/>
      </figure>
      <p>An update is currently rolling out for improvements to the fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S10. The release notes do not go into much specifics about the update, other than it is for the biometrics and fingerprints in particular. It could possibly be in response to the user who was able to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s10s-fingerprint-reader-secure-enough">bypass the fingerprint sensor with a 3D print</a>, or maybe it is just to improve performance.</p>
      <p>Initial response has been positive with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bbyx4u/biometrics_update_rolling_out">several users reporting</a> that it does indeed increase the speed of the sensor. However, we've not been able to test it for ourselves yet.</p>
      <p>If you're away from Wi-Fi and looking to update then don't worry as the update is a rather small one weighting in at only 6.9MB. If you've not received the update already, then be patient, as it often takes time to roll out, specifically for unlocked users.</p>
      <h4>April 8, 2019 — Galaxy S10 5G render confirms May 16 launch on Verizon</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/04/galaxy-s10-5g-ah-render.jpg?itok=GTrv4tDS"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Earlier this month, reliable tipster Evan Blass shared that the Galaxy S10 5G would be released on Verizon on May 16. A Bloomberg report a day later further reinforced this idea, and now thanks to a leaked render of the S10 5G, the May 16 date is all but confirmed.</p>
      <p>The render comes to us via <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/04/verizon-samsung-galaxy-s10-5g.html">Android Headlines</a>, and as you can see, the date on the lock screen reads, "Thu, May 16."</p>
      <p>As a reminder, the Galaxy S10 5G has a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, four rear cameras, and is expected to cost well over $1,000.</p>
      <h4>April 5, 2019 — Galaxy S10 5G pre-orders might begin on April 18</h4>
      <p>Just yesterday, Evan Blass reported that the Galaxy S10 5G will finally hit the U.S. on May 16. According to another report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-04/5g-gets-real-as-samsung-verizon-gear-up-for-new-phone-launch">Bloomberg</a>, pre-orders are scheduled to begin this month.</p>
      <p>Per Bloomberg:</p>
      <blockquote>Verizon Communications Inc. will begin taking orders on April 18 for the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G -- the first fifth-generation phone to go on sale in the U.S.</blockquote>
      <p>The expected launch date of May 16 still remains, meaning Samsung will give customers nearly a full month to get pre-orders in before the S10 5G actually ships.</p>

      <p>According to a cryptic tweet from the ever-reliable Evan Blass, the Galaxy S10 5G will make its debut in the U.S. on May 16. The phone will launch initially on Verizon — which just started rolling out its 5G network <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/verizon-begins-rolling-out-5g-network-chicago-and-minneapolis">in Chicago and Minneapolis</a> — and will also make its way to AT&amp;T later in the year.</p>
      <p>We'll have to wait until the U.S. launch to find out how much the Galaxy S10 5G will cost, but the phone is going on sale from tomorrow in Samsung's home market for the equivalent of $1,125. That should provide a decent baseline to gauge how much the device will end up costing Stateside.</p>
      <h4>April 1, 2019 — Samsung confirms April 5 launch for the Galaxy S10 5G</h4>
      <p>About a week ago, a report surfaced claiming that Samsung will launch the Galaxy S10 5G on April 5 in Korea. Now, Samsung is confirming that news.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/the-next-generation-speed-and-performance-starts-with-galaxy-s10-5g-samsungs-first-5g-smartphone-on-the-market">a press release</a> issued on April 1 that is surprisingly not an April Fool's joke, Samsung said "the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G will be available in Korea starting April 5, 2019." Customers in the U.S. will have to wait until June to get their hands on the S10 5G through Verizon, and this will then be followed by a launch in Europe.</p>
      <p>We don't have U.S. pricing yet, but Samsung has said that the Galaxy S10 5G starts out at 1.39 million KRW for the 256GB model and goes up to 1.56 million KRW if you get 512GB. In USD, that works out to around $1,125 and $1,375, respectively.</p>
      <h4>March 27, 2019 — The Galaxy S10+ was used to film an episode of Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show</h4>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1110677918353633280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>The cameras on the Galaxy S10 are tremendously powerful, and apparently, NBC likes them so much that it used only an S10+ to film an entire episode of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.</p>
      <p>Samsung shared a behind-the-scenes video about how the S10+ was used during the filming, and as you can see, NBC still used gimbles and professional lighting. Even so, it is pretty impressive that we've gotten to a ponit where a national television show can be recorded entirely on a smartphone.</p>
      <h4>March 22, 2019 — Galaxy S10 5G expected to launch on April 5</h4>
      <p>While the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e have been available for purchase for two weeks, there's still one version of the phone that we're eagerly awaiting — the Galaxy S10 5G. Thankfully, it looks like our waiting may soon be over.</p>
      <p>According to a report from <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190321000615">The Korea Herald</a>, Samsung will begin sales of the S10 5G in Korea starting on April 5. It'll be sold at "Samsung outlets and its online mall as well as at shops of mobile carriers in Korea."</p>
      <p>Rather than having pre-orders for the phone, Samsung will instead offer promotions between April 5 and April 16 — allowing customers to get a free pair of Galaxy Buds, a wireless charger, or 50% off a future screen replacement with their purchase.</p>
      <p>Following the launch in Korea, it's said that the Galaxy S10 5G will make its way to Verizon in the United States on April 11.</p>
      <h4>March 8, 2019 — Galaxy S10 officially released, now comes with 6 months of Spotify Premium</h4>
      <p>After being available for pre-order since February 21, the Samsung Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e are now all out of the pre-order stage and available for immediate purchase.</p>
      <p>As we expected, this means that the previous pre-order bonus of getting a $130 gift certificate with your order is gone. In its place, Samsung is now offering 6 months of Spotify Premium for free.</p>
      <p>While this is a nice promo, it's worth noting that only new Spotify Premium customers can take advantage of it. If you're currently subscribed to Premium or have done so in the past, you won't be eligible.</p>
      <h4>March 6, 2019 — iFixit gives the Galaxy S10 a repairability score of 3 out of 10</h4>
      <p>We all know that the Galaxy S10 is one gorgeous device, but as it turns out, that beauty comes at a cost.</p>
      <p>iFixit recently published its full teardown of the Galaxy S10 and S10e and gave both phones a low repairability score of just 3 out of 10.</p>
      <p>While iFixit did praise the S10 and S10e for requiring just one Philips screwdriver for removing all of the screws, it knocked both phones for having difficult battery and screen replacements.</p>

      <h4>March 4, 2019 — Galaxy S10 receives DisplayMate's highest-ever grade</h4>
      <p>It's no secret that the Galaxy S10's display is one of the best around, but if you had any lingering doubts, DisplayMate's recent analysis of it should put them to rest.</p>
      <p>In DisplayMate's review, the company said:</p>
      <blockquote>Even with our new tougher grading standards and new tests, the Galaxy S10 receives 100% All Green Very Good to Excellent Ratings in All Categories, earning DisplayMate's highest ever A+ grade.</blockquote>
      <p>Furthermore, DisplayMate also went on to say that the Galaxy S10's screen is "the most color accurate display" it's ever tested.</p>

      <h4>March 1, 2019 — Netflix adds HDR support for the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e</h4>
      <p>Before the phones even officially hit store shelves, Netflix has already <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23939">confirmed HDR support</a> for the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e.</p>
      <p>In other words, if you're watching Netflix on one of Samsung's new phones and the show is available in HDR, you'll see it with brighter, more contrasty colors for an overall better experience.</p>
      <p>We had no reason to believe the phones wouldn't get HDR for Netflix, but it's nice to get the confirmation nonetheless.</p>
      <h4>February 28, 2019 — The Galaxy S10 and S10+ ship with a pre-installed screen protector</h4>
      <p>One of the most exciting features of the Galaxy S10 and S10+ is the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that's hidden underneath their displays. We already knew that the ultrasonic tech would cause issues with third-party screen protectors, and in response to this, Samsung's confirmed that both phones ship with a Samsung-made one pre-installed out of the box.</p>
      <p>Per a post on the <a href="https://community.samsungmembers.com/en_CA/notice_detail?id=1900">Samsung Members site</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Samsung's upcoming new flagship Galaxy S10 will be shipped with factory pre-installed screen protector manufactured by Samsung. This is applicable for all global subsidiaries and for all variants of Galaxy S10. This decision was made to increase overall customer experiences with the improved screen durability and full functionality of the Ultrasonic Fingerprint Sensor on Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+.</blockquote>
      <p>The screen protectors come with a 90-day warranty, and if it ends up getting scratched, worn, or you simply want a back-up in case something happens, you'll be able to buy additional ones for $29.99 CAD (around $20 USD).</p>
      <h4>February 27, 2019 — Samsung now offering $130 gift certificate with Galaxy S10 pre-orders</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/02/galaxy-s10-preorder-130-gift-certificate.jpg?itok=oTb1lRiR"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Since pre-orders for the Galaxy S10 opened on February 21, Samsung's been offering a promotion that allows you to grab a free pair of Galaxy Buds with your purchase. As of February 27, things have changed a bit.</p>
      <p>Citing "high interest" in Galaxy S10 pre-orders, Samsung's actually run out of Galaxy Buds supply and is now offering a $130 gift certificate when you buy the phone. The $130 credit can be used towards "select products" on Samsung.com and via the Shop Samsung app, and for some people, this may be an even more appealing deal. You can buy Galaxy Buds when they get back in stock, or put that $130 towards whatever else you want. Not too shabby.</p>
