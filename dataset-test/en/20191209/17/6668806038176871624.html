      <p>Ranveer Singh is currently flying high on success. The last few years have simply been outstanding for the actor both in terms of performances as well as the box-office numbers.

      <p>The YRF film has a start to finish schedule and a lot of it is being shot in the night. So as to save time on commute and energy, he has taken this decision. Interestingly, this is not the first time that Ranveer has shifted base from his actual home for a shoot. During the shoot of his 2018 release Padmaavat, the actor moved into the very same Goregaon home. <br/><br/>Now that is some dedication. Don’t you agree?</p>
