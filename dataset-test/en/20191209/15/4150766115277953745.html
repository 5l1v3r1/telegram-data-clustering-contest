      <p>In a rare show of box-office stasis, the top five films in North American theaters were unchanged this weekend from last, led again by Disney blockbuster <i>Frozen 2</i>, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Sunday.</p>
      <p>The animated musical, which has Queen Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) and the gang traveling to an enchanted forest, took in an estimated $34.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period, boosting its domestic total to $337 million and its global take to $920 million.</p>
      <p>That lifted Disney’s global ticket sales for 2019 past a record $10 billion, according to <i>Hollywood Reporter</i>.</p>
      <p>In second again was Lionsgate’s murder mystery <i>Knives Out</i>, at $14.2 million for the weekend. The film stars Daniel Craig – a detective with a droll, over-the-top Southern accent – Jamie Lee Curtis and Chris Evans in an Agatha Christie-worthy tale that critics have called “deliciously entertaining.”</p>
      <p>In third was <i>Fox’s Ford v. Ferrari</i>, at $6.5 million. The film, based on a true story, tells how a team at Ford built a car to challenge Ferrari’s dominance of France’s classic 24-hour Le Mans race. Matt Damon and Christian Bale star.</p>
      <p>Universal’s <i>Queen &amp; Slim</i> placed fourth, taking $6.5 million. Daniel Kaluuya of <i>Get Out</i> fame and Jodie Turner-Smith, a British-born model and actor, play an African-American couple whose terrible first date turns even worse when they have a disastrous encounter with a racist cop.</p>
      <p>And in fifth was Sony’s <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>, taking in $5.2 million. The drama recounts the true story of how a cynical and distrusting journalist is befriended by beloved TV star Fred Rogers, played by Tom Hanks.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the top 10 were: <i>Dark Waters</i> ($4.1 million), <i>21 Bridges</i> ($2.9 million), <i>Playing With Fire</i> ($2 million), <i>Midway</i> ($1.9 million) and <i>Joker</i> ($1 million).</p>
