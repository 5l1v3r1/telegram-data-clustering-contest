      <h2>Andy Anokye, otherwise known as Solo 45, is on trial at Bristol Crown Court</h2>

      <p>A woman told police she wanted to die after musician Andy Anokye allegedly beat and raped her, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>The complainant's interview was heard by a jury in the trial of Anokye, who is charged with multiple rape.</p>
      <p>Anokye, 32, originally from London, but now of Millennium Promenade in Bristol city centre, is on trial at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/courts">Bristol Crown Court</a>.</p>
      <p>He faces 22 charges of rape; two charges of actual bodily harm (ABH), five false imprisonments and two assaults by penetration.</p>
      <p>Anokye is better known as rapper Solo 45, and rose to fame in 2014 with the single Feed Em To The Lions.</p>
      <p>The jury was provided with headphones to hear the police interview of the second complainant in the case.</p>
      <p>The press were provided with a transcript of what she said.</p>
      <p>She said she met the defendant in 2015 and started sleeping with him.</p>
      <p>At first they got on “really well”, she said, though she described sex with Anokye as a bit rough.</p>
      <p>The complainant said they then met at a later date but she no longer wanted to sleep with him and Anokye questioned her about seeing other men.</p>

      <p>She told police: “I think he’s hit me a few times and then he’s obviously, when he comes to having sex, then he was just like, I was literally being forced and I couldn’t do anything about it.”</p>
      <p>The complainant described Anokye as “an intimidating person”.</p>
      <p>She told police they had sex and at times Anokye would film it.</p>
      <p>During sex Anokye would call her names, she said.</p>
      <p>She told police she did not consent to the sex and felt like she had no choice.</p>
      <h3>'I think I was under control by someone'</h3>
      <p>She said she was embarrassed about what happened and felt she had no choice in what happened, feeling she was manipulated.</p>
      <p>On one occasion she met him at a music festival and had consensual sexual activity with Anokye in a car.</p>
      <p>She said Anokye told her he had sex with her when she didn’t want it, which he described as “technically rape” and admitted raping her three to four times.</p>
      <p>She told police: “I think, obviously at the time I didn’t think but when you think about it I think I was under control by someone and he could have just told me to jump off a bridge and I would have done it.”</p>
      <p>The woman referred to another occasion, at her house, when she was beaten by the accused and she had to shield her injuries from her family.</p>
      <p>The complainant told police Anokye used her phone to hit her over the head, leaving her hair matted with blood.</p>
      <p>She said he then repeatedly hit her with his hands.</p>
      <p>She said she had wanted to die, because if she died the abuse would stop and he wouldn’t be able to do anything else.</p>
      <p>The woman told police she didn’t report the abuse earlier because she “didn’t want it to be true”.</p>
      <p>She also cited a threat Anokye made to “water board” her (put a towel over her face and pour water over her) - but he didn’t do so.</p>
      <p>The case continues.</p>
