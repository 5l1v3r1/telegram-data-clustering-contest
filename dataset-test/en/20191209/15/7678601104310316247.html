      <p>President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has named former Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara as the new president director of state-owned utility company PLN, says an official close to the President.</p>
      <p>“I think the President naming Pak Rudi is a very apt decision, and I think it will improve PLN,” Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Panjaitan said in Jakarta on Monday. “Pak Rudi is a former PLN person after all. He also worked well in the first Cabinet.” </p>
      <p>Rudiantara served as PLN deputy president director from 2008 to 2009, before becoming the communications and information minister in Jokowi’s first term, from 2014 to 2019, when he spearheaded the government’s Palapa Ring internet infrastructure project.</p>
      <p>PLN has been led by several acting president directors, with Sripeni Inten Cahyani as the current boss, since former head Sofyan Basir was indicted in a corruption case by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in June. He was cleared of the charges in November.</p>
      <p>PLN corporate communications head I Made Suprateka told The Jakarta Post the company had not received official word about the appointment.</p>
      <p>“I just read the news. We haven’t received any official statements about it,” he said.</p>
