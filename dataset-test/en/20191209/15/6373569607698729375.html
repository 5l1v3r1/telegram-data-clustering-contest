      <h2>It's the company's first outlet in Devon</h2>

      <p>Cornish pasty shop Malcolm Barnecutt has made its first move into Devon by opening a store in Plymouth city centre.</p>
      <p>The pasty makers have taken on the former <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/business/plymouths-early-learning-centre-close-1581224">Early Learning Centre</a> - ironically on Cornwall Street - with doors now open to the public ahead of Christmas.</p>
      <p>Owner and son of Malcolm, James Barnecutt, said: "We're a fourth generation company and this is our 12th shop, our first one in Devon.</p>
      <p>"It's going really well so far and we're really happy.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to come to Devon because we fancied the challenge of trying a city.</p>

      <p>"The towns in Cornwall are suffering a little bit because of the out of town supermarkets and the banks closing.</p>
      <p>"I just thought it would be nice to get into a city where there is a massive footfall.</p>
      <p>"We opened last Thursday and it's been 12 months in the planning. It took quite a while but we got there.</p>
      <p>"We've got two or three shops that have got indoor seating but a lot of them are just takeaways.</p>
      <p>"Because of the size of the shop we're able to do seating and we're doing really well with coffees and eat ins so that's great."</p>

      <p>Malcolm’s grandfather Percy founded Barnecutts in 1930 in Liskeard. He also owned and ran a bakery in Bugle, before opening a shop and bakers in Trebetherick, still known today as Rock Bakery.</p>
      <p>Malcolm Barnecutt has many shops throughout Cornwall and now Plymouth offering <a href="http://www.barnecutt.co.uk/products/pasties-pies/">Cornish Pasties</a>, Saffron Cakes, a wide range of mouth-watering confectionery, and several recipes handed down by Malcolm’s father and grandfather.</p>
      <p>The lower floor of the premises is used as a food prep area with fridges and freezers, with the ground floor level featuring two seating areas with 17 tables, a servery, food prep area, a lounge seating area, toilets and dishwashing facilities.</p>
