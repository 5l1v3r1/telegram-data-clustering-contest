      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk drove the electric-car maker's Cybertruck near Los Angeles on Saturday, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/08/elon-musk-cybertruck-first-time-public-malibu-nobu/">TMZ</a> reported. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;v=dPrcl5f4rhU&amp;feature=emb_logo">Another video</a> posted on YouTube shows the Cybertruck driving on the 405 Freeway that night, though Musk is not visible.</p>
      <p>Photos and videos from TMZ show Musk in the vehicle at the restaurant Nobu. The musician Grimes, who according to media reports has been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-girlfriend-grimes-relationship-photos-2018-8#she-first-met-elon-musk-over-twitter-musk-was-planning-to-make-a-joke-about-artificial-intelligence-specifically-about-the-rococo-basilisk-character-in-her-flesh-without-blood-video-and-discovered-she-had-beaten-him-to-the-punch-2">dating Musk</a>, appears to be one of the vehicle's passengers.</p>
      <p>When leaving the restaurant, Musk appeared to disobey and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-elon-musk-hits-traffic-sign-tesla-cybertruck-malibu-2019-12">knock down</a> a sign instructing drivers to make only right turns while making a left turn. The sign appeared to have been posted by Nobu, rather than a government agency. </p>
      <p>A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the maneuver.</p>
      <p>Tesla <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">unveiled</a> the Cybertruck in November, saying production for models intended for customers would begin in late 2021. While the vehicle's design has been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-roasted-twitter-2019-11">divisive</a>, it has received <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-reports-250000-pre-orders-for-tesla-cybertruck-2019-11">at least 250,000</a> refundable $100 preorders, and its listed performance specs <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-ford-f-150-compared-specs-photos-2019-11">top those of the 2020 Ford F-150</a> in areas like maximum payload and towing capacity.</p>
