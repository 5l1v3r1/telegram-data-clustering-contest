      <p>The children targeted also sent naked photos of themselves to Connor McDougall.</p>
      <p>Police were contacted after a sister and a dad of the girls saw messages sent by him.</p>
      <p>McDougall, 19, of Dover Drive, appeared in the dock at Dunfermline Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>He admitted that on various occasions between May 1 and 31 last year he caused a girl, then aged 14, to look at a sexual image by sending her an image of male genitals.</p>
      <p>He also admitted he sent text and social media messages to the girl containing comments of a sexual nature.</p>
      <p>McDougall further admitted that between February 1 and June 30 last year he sent an indecent image to a girl, then aged 15. He also sent written communications to the same girl and encouraged her to engage in sexual acts.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Azrah Yousaf said in both cases McDougall had sent indecent photos of himself to the girls and they had sent photos of themselves.</p>
      <p>In the second case, he had sent the girl a message saying he was feeling “horny”.</p>
      <p>However, the girl’s dad found the messages on her phone and contacted the police.</p>
      <p>The elder sister of the first girl had also discovered the messages.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alastair Brown told McDougall, “Children under 16 years old are off-limits sexually, full stop.</p>
      <p>“It’s as simple as that.”</p>
      <p>He imposed a community payback order with one year of supervision and 225 hours of unpaid work.</p>
