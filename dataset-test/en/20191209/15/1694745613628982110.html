      <p>As expected, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Frozen-2"><b>Frozen 2</b></a> brought fans exciting <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/frozen-2-review-spoilers-46900213">twists and turns</a> and an <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/disney-frozen-2-movie-soundtrack-46693326">undeniably catchy soundtrack</a> that we'll be rocking out to well into the new year. On Dec. 5, Disney released the full video of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/how-much-did-frozen-2-make-at-box-office-46940285">the record-breaking sequel's</a> most defining song, "Into the Unknown," and we're getting chills just listening to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/frozen-2-interview-video-46924331">Idina Menzel</a> belt out those high notes!</p>
      <p>Written by Oscar winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, the musical scene shows Queen Elsa as she ruminates on her desires to venture into, well, the unknown! Elsa — who was always a bit repressed with hiding her powers in the first film and taking on the crown under a lot of stress — sings along with a mysterious voice about feeling like there must be something more for her outside Arendelle. We won't spoil the movie, but let's just say that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/frozen-2-review-spoilers-46900213">Elsa definitely gets a taste of the unknown</a> after this musical sequence! Watch the video above.</p>
