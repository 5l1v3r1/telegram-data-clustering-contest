        <b>Axel Witsel has been a regular for Borussia Dortmund this season but will miss at least four matches after undergoing facial surgery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel has been ruled out for the rest of the year after being hospitalised by an “awkward fall” at his home.</p>
      <p>Witsel, who played a full part in Saturday’s 5-0 win over Fortuna Dusseldorf, underwent oral and facial surgery at Klinikzentrum Nord Hospital over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international has been discharged from hospital but will miss at least four matches ahead of the mid-season break, starting with Tuesday’s Champions League clash with Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>“Witsel will sadly be out for the rest of this year,” BVB boss Lucien Favre confirmed at Monday’s pre-match news conference.</p>

      <p>“I was told about this yesterday morning. We could not speak to him. He was in hospital.</p>
      <p>“But there is one positive thing – he’s already back home. We can’t change it now. It’s a shame for him, a shame for us. He’s one of the most important players for us.”</p>
      <p>Asked to provide more details on the injury, Dortmund media director Sascha Fligge said the midfielder “fell awkwardly at home”.</p>
      <p>Witsel has scored three goals in 21 appearances for Dortmund this season.</p>
