      <p>Prosecuting, Barbara Webster revealed he had communicated with both schoolgirls via social media app Snapchat before the attacks took place at his home.</p>

      <p>“She didn’t have any money at that stage and felt bad she hadn’t paid him back.”</p>
      <p>The youngster agreed to go back to his home as it was cold outside.</p>
      <p>But once inside he locked her in and told her to go in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>When she tried to go to the lounge Gilyeat told her: “No, no, no.”</p>
      <p>The court heard he kept trying to kiss her before becoming “rough” with her, grabbing her hair.</p>
      <p>He ignored her desperate pleas as she was attacked, telling her: “One more minute, I love you baby.”</p>
      <p>When she told him what he had done was rape, Gilyeat replied: “I know, I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p>In a second incident, Gilyeat offered to pay the train fare for a vulnerable 16-year-old to travel from her home in Yorkshire to Morecambe to come and see him, along with friends.</p>
      <p>The court heard she thought he “was a bit weird”, smacking her legs and making lewd remarks.</p>
      <p>When they all got back to his home, he raped her in his room, attempting to strangle her at one point.</p>
      <p>Miss Webster said his young victim told him repeatedly to stop and that he was hurting her, but he replied it “wasn’t his fault”.</p>
      <p>The youngster managed to alert her social worker, who rang police, and they attended at Gilyeat’s home.</p>
      <p>In a distressing victim statement, the first child spoke of her torment after other youngsters learned what had happened.</p>
      <p>She revealed some had bullied her, refusing to believe her and calling her names.</p>
