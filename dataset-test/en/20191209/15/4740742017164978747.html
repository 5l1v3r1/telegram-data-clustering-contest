      <p>A fundraising campaign has been launched to raise money for the children of a young Bristol woman who died suddenly in her sleep.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-three Carrie Louise Steven, 38, was found dead at her home early on November 29 by a family friend.</p>
      <p>Carrie, a beauty therapist, had spent the evening at home at Knowle with a friend and had gone to bed as normal.</p>
      <p>Her death has rocked the local community where she lived with her partner Steve.</p>
      <p>A Go Fund Me page has now been set up by friend Samantha Vile to raise money for the children.</p>
      <p>Samantha said: “Everyone is completely numb at what has happened.</p>

      <p>“Carrie was very loved and a bubbly and outgoing person.</p>
      <p>“This has left us all devastated.</p>
      <p>“I have spoken to the family and just felt that I needed to do something to help, so set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money.”</p>
      <p>Carrie and the family had been on holiday to Turkey previously and had planned to make a return trip next year.</p>
      <p>Samantha – who has known Carrie’s partner Steve since they were children - said: “The children told me that mum loved Turkey and how they were planning to go back for another holiday there.</p>
      <p>“The money can be used for them to return there and remember their mum in a place which she loved and where she was happy.”</p>
      <p>As well as the Go Fund Me page, raffles and other fundraisers, including a dance show, are being organised in the local community to remember Carrie and support the family.</p>
