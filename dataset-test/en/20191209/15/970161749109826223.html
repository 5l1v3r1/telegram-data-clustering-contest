      <h1>Boris Johnson says he is looking at abolishing the TV licence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:43:08+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Drewett</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has said he is ‘certainly looking at’ getting rid of all TV licences.</p>
      <p>While speaking in the north east of England today, the prime minister was asked whether a Tory government would abolish TV licence fees for everybody.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said that ‘as this late stage in the campaign’ he would not be willing to make an ‘unfunded spending commitment like that’.</p>
      <p>But, he told a crowd at Fergusons Transport factory in Washington, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sunderland-fc/">Sunderland</a>, that the BBC ‘should cough up and pay for the licences for the over-75s as they promised to do’.</p>
      <p>The PM added: ‘At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licence fees, though I am certainly looking at it.</p>

      <p>‘You have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV, a media organisation still makes sense in the long-term given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves – that’s all I will say.</p>
      <p>‘I think that the system of funding by what is effectively a general tax, isn’t it, everybody has a TV, it bears reflection – let me put it that way.</p>
      <p>‘How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels – that is the question.’</p>
      <p>In November, both the Tories and Labour pledged to keep free TV licences for over-75s if they win the 12 December general election.</p>
      <p>The BBC has said from 2020 only those on pension credit will qualify, after it was made responsible for funding them under the charter agreement.</p>

      <p>Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said the removal of the benefit was ‘utterly callous’.</p>
      <p>While Mr Johnson ordered officials to find a way to ensure no over 75s would need to pay as a ‘priority’.</p>
      <p>Today, Mr Watson called the PM’s statement a ‘pathetic attempt’ to distract from an incident in which he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/boris-takes-reporters-phone-shown-picture-boy-sleeping-hospital-floor-11510485/">refused to look at a picture of a four-year-old boy</a> forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson came under fire for taking a reporter’s phone and putting it in his own pocket instead of looking at the picture of Jack Williment-Barr at Leeds General Infirmary.</p>
      <p>Mr Watson said: ‘His comments today reveal that he will threaten the very existence of another of Britain’s great institutions, the BBC, by scrapping its funding mechanism.</p>
      <p>‘This is on top of the cruel decision to strip over-75s of their free TV licences.’</p>

      <p>The BBC and the government came under fierce criticism over the move to scrap free licences to all people aged over 75, which was announced in June.</p>
      <p>The decision came after the government made the BBC shoulder the cost of the benefit as part of its funding settlement.</p>
      <p>The corporation said retaining the benefit for all over-75s would have cost £745 million – a fifth of the BBC’s budget – by 2021-22 and led to ‘unprecedented closures’.</p>
      <p>BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio 5live, and a number of local radio stations could all be put at risk, the BBC said.</p>
      <p>In October, the House of Commons media select committee said the decision to scrap the licence fees for just some over-75s was ‘an absurd situation’.</p>
