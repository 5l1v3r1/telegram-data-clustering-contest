      <p>A father who topped the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/christmas/index.html"><b>Christmas</b></a> charts last year with an ode to sausage rolls is back with another pastry-inspired tune. </p>
      <p>Mark Hoyle, 31, from Nottingham, who blogs under the name LadBaby, announced over the weekend he would release another charity single following last year's success, which will be available from Friday 13th. </p>
      <p>Hoyle became number one quite unexpectedly last year, beating mega stars like <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/ariana-grande/index.html"><b>Ariana Grande</b></a> and Ava Max with his parody of the 1985 song 'We Built this City' by Starship, singing 'We Built This City On Sausage Rolls.'</p>
      <p>It had all started as a joke, but Hoyle and his wife, Roxanne, donated all the song's profits to The Trussell Trust, the country's largest food bank network. </p>
      <p>In a video published yesterday on his Youtube Channel, the blogger, who counts more than 745,000 subscribers, announced he would release a new song this year, this time to the tune of Joan Jett's 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll.' </p>

      <p>All proceeds of the single, which was produced at Abbey Road will once again be donated to the Trust, which provided 70,000 emergency meal packages to people in need last year, thanks to Hoyle.</p>
      <p>'So everyone's been asking, haven't they, "Are you gonna do another song this year?". And I really wasn't,' Hoyle said on his YouTube channel.  </p>
      <p>'But when we think we have the ability to change the lives of that many people, then why would we not,' he went on.   </p>
      <p>'I wanna raise even more for the people in this country living in poverty.' </p>

        <figcaption>The father-of-two, pictured after his win last year, picked this year's song from a top 50 karaoke songs in the UK so that everyone could sing along </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He went on to announce the single was already available for pre-order on several streaming platforms including iTunes and Amazon, and that the song and accompanying video would be released this Friday. </p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50689045"><b>the BBC</b></a>, Hoyle said: 'Brace yourself, my singing voice is back.' </p>
      <p>He also said he and Roxanne had written the new tune in under five hours. </p>
      <p>Teasing the contents of his new opus, Hoyle promised many puns and sausage rolls-related lyrics, such as: 'I love sausage rolls, so put another on in the oven baby.'</p>

        <figcaption>Hoyle said he hoped to help twice as many people as he did last year with his charity single (pictured in 2018) </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He explained the couple picked the tune from the Top 50 karaoke songs in the UK, because they wanted a song that everyone could sing along to. </p>
      <p>If successful, Hoyle will be the third UK act to reach back-to-back Christmas number ones, with the Beatles and the Spice Girls. </p>
      <p>However, this year's competition might be even fiercer than last's, with Taylor Swift making a run for the coveted spot with her song 'Christmas Tree Farm.' </p>
      <p>Other charity singles are in the running too, with Shaun Dooley, from Broadchurch fame and the Grimethord Colliery Band covering Taylor Swift's 'Never Growing Up' for Children in Need. </p>
      <p>Another contender, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7760933/Six-year-old-girl-survived-brain-tumour-knocks-Stormzy-spot-Amazon-download-chart.html"><b>Lyra Cole</b></a>, only six, is already a favourite, with her version of When a Child is born for the Brain Tumour charity.</p>
      <p>The young girl, who underwent emergency surgery as a baby, has already dethroned Grime giant Stormzy from the top spot in Amazon download chart with the cover of the 1976 Christmas classic. </p>

      <p>Hoyle was gobsmacked last year when it was announced his  song 'We built this city (on sausage rolls) had <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-6520817/Daddy-blogger-LadBaby-wins-Christmas-No-1.html"><b>topped the chart</b></a>.  </p>
      <p>Mark and Roxanne gained viral fame by sharing parenting and budget tips videos on Youtube and other social media platforms. </p>
      <p>The whole idea behind the Christmas single started as a joke when one of their followers told Hoyle he should record a song on sausage rolls.   </p>
      <p>Singing about one of the public's favourite pastries, the lyrics included: 'If you've never had one, And don't recognise the taste.</p>
      <p>'It's a cylindrical bit of pork wrapped, In a puff pastry case.'</p>
      <p>While the fun lyrics and visuals made last year's hit a comedic treat, the issue of food banks and hunger was very dear to the family's heart. </p>
      <p>Last year, Hoyle revealed he and Roxanne had once struggled to survive on a single income. </p>
      <p>While they never used a food bank themselves, they said they understood families whose only option it was.  </p>
