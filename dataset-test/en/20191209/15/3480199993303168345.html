      <p>Though it’s not as pleasant, ensuring that your car stays clean in the chills of winter can be more essential than keeping it pristine during the height of summer.</p>
      <p>As a result of gritters being on the road as well as general muck and dirt finding its way onto our highways, winter can be a tough time for cars. If you want to keep your car’s bodywork in a good condition, it’s paramount that you give it a bit of regular maintenance. Here’s how.</p>
      <h3>General rinse</h3>
      <p>This one is pretty self-explanatory. Giving your car a thorough rinse before anything else gets rid of surface grime and loose materials, as well as washing any salt from rust-prone areas like the wheelarches and sills.</p>

      <p>Don’t be shy with the pressure washer, either; concentrate on areas like the grille, front splitter and under-boot section. You’d be surprised where salt and grit manages to get to.</p>
      <h3>Pre-wash</h3>
      <p>Applying a pre-wash can make the whole process easier. A product like snow foam or a designated cleaner can strip the grime and muck off a car and ensure that the most amount of grit and salt is taken away.</p>

      <p>Allow it to sit for a good amount of time before rinsing off and carrying forward to the next step.</p>
      <h3>Lathered up</h3>
      <p>The next part of the process is to apply plenty of car shampoo. Don’t ever attempt this with household dish soap – it’ll do more bad than good, as it can strip a lot of the protective coating on a paint.</p>

      <p>Leave it on for a little while, too. Allow it to work its way into all of the difficult areas, and don’t be tempted to rinse it off too early. Then, get scrubbing with a soft microfibre mitt.</p>
      <h3>Rinse</h3>

      <p>Give the whole car a thorough rinse once you’re all done scrubbing. Concentrate on fiddly areas like the wheels and brakes, as well as in gutter sections and in the wing mirrors.</p>
      <h3>Dry</h3>
      <p>Use a clean, dry microfibre cloth to remove all of the excess water from the car’s bodywork.</p>
      <p>This not only takes off the last of the surface grime that the scrub may have missed, but it also means the car isn’t covered in streaks as it dries.</p>
      <h3>Spray wax</h3>
      <p>A finishing touch, but a worthwhile one, spraying a wax or sealant is a great way of prolonging the shine you’ve worked so hard to create.</p>

      <p>Apply a coat of your favourite product and it’ll make cleaning dirt and grime off next time a little easier, too.</p>
