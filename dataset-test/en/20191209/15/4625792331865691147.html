      <h1>GOP congresswoman demands Schiff release call logs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:35:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Dominick Mastrangelo</a></address>
      <p>New York Rep. Elise Stefanik echoed a growing Republican cry for the release of call records showing contacts between the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and the whistleblower whose report has sparked an impeachment investigation into President Trump.</p>
      <p>"Every American should be outraged by this unprecedented abuse of power by Adam Schiff," Stefanik said <a href="https://twitter.com/EliseStefanik/status/1203666657769598976?s=20">in a tweet</a>. "Adam Schiff should immediately release HIS personal phone records so the American people will be able to see his coordination with the whistleblower."</p>
      <p>Republicans have complained that Schiff improperly surveilled <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/its-an-abuse-of-power-gop-seeks-recourse-for-schiff-snooping-on-congress-and-press">members of their party</a> and journalists as his committee gathered evidence as part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>"Where's Adam?" a poster board displayed behind <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-judiciary-committee-holds-latest-impeachment-testimony">House Republicans</a> on the Judiciary Committee read Monday.</p>
      <p>Last month, the House Intelligence Committee held five days of public hearings about the circumstances leading to a July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump asked Zelensky to "do him a favor" and announce an investigation into 2020 Democratic front-runner Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>Republicans have said there was nothing wrong with Trump asking for that favor.</p>
      <p>After an impassioned defense of Trump during recent hearings, Stefanik has been heralded by Trump and Republican leadership as a "rising star" in the party and raked in a big fundraising hall.</p>
