      <p><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_23c6727cde8edc29d290e49139d4b551">American Airlines </a>Inc., the largest airline operating at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, has set a company record for the number of days without a canceled flight.</p>
      <p>The carrier went seven days without a cancellation across its entire network in November, which was a record for the most in a month, according to an email sent to employees from American’s Senior Vice President of Operations <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/search/results?q=David%20Seymour">David Seymour</a> that was obtained by the Business Journal.</p>
      <p>Three of those days without a canceled flight came during the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>
      <p>“Many factors helped set us up for success, including fewer aircraft out of service each day, better right start performance and Mother Nature’s cooperation until this past weekend with inclement weather in the Northeast and in San Francisco,” Seymour wrote.</p>
