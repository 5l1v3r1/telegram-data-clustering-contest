      <h1>Juice Wrld Allegedly Consumed Pills on Plane Before His Death, 70 Pounds of Marijuana Seized: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:46:55+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/peterberry/" target="_blank">Peter A. Berry</a></address>
      <p>More details of the circumstances surrounding <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/12/juice-wrld-dead/">Juice Wrld's death </a>have reportedly just been revealed.</p>
      <p>According to a Monday (Dec. 9) report from <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/09/juice-wrld-private-jet-drugs-70-pounds-marijuana-arrests-feds/">TMZ</a>, people aboard the private jet <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/juice-wrld/">Juice Wrld</a> was flying in told police that the rapper had consumed several pills before his seizure, which is one he suffered after arriving at Chicago Midway International Airport on Sunday morning. Additionally, law enforcement sources say they found a bottle of codeine cough syrup on the plane and 70 pounds of marijuana were reportedly seized from the jet. The FBI reportedly seized the marijuana.</p>
      <p>Two people in Juice's entourage, security guards Chris Long and Henry Dean, were also <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/12/juice-wrld-security-guards-arrested-guns-airport/">arrested for having concealed guns at the airport</a>. Despite having valid conceal and carry permits, that does not authorize the men to have the weapons in the airport. As a result, they were charged with misdemeanor gun violations. Long also serves as a photographer for Juice Wrld.</p>
      <p>The site also says that a person aboard the plane told authorities that the<a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/12/juice-wrld-dead-rappers-react/"> beloved rapper </a>had a Percocet problem. Juice Wrld's official cause of death hasn't yet been revealed, but an autopsy is supposed to be conducted today.</p>
      <p>This news arrives one day after the announcement of Juice Wrld's death. In a statement, his record label,<a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/12/juice-wrld-death-statement/"> Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, spoke on his passing.</a></p>
      <p>"Juice made a profound impact on the world in such a short period of time," the statement begins. "He was a gentle soul, whose creativity knew no bounds, an exceptional human being and artist who loved and cared for his fans above everything else. To lose someone so kind and so close to our hearts is devastating. Our thoughts are with Juice’s family and friends, everyone at his label Grade A, and his millions of fans around the world."</p>
