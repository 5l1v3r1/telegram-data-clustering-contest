      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In 2017, a Bayonetta and Vanquish bundle leaked.</li>
        <li>Today, the bundle was discovered on the Microsoft Store.</li>
        <li>It includes remastered versions of Bayonetta and Vanquish.</li>
        <li>The games should look spectacular on Xbox One X.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>*Updated December 9, 2019:** Sega confirmed that the bundle should launch on February 18, 2020.</p>

      <p>Last night, we reported that a remastered version of <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/vanquish-remaster-appears-microsoft-store-runs-4k-60-fps-xbox-one-x">Vanquish</a> was spotted on the Microsoft Store. The release date was listed as February 2020 and it said that the game ran at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second (FPS) on Xbox One X. Well, this was just part of the story.</p>
      <p>In 2017, images of a Bayonetta and Vanquish remaster bundle leaked online but Sega didn't confirm that it was working on native Xbox One ports of the two titles. Flash forward to the end of 2019 and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39979/bayonetta-vanquish-remaster-release-date-xbox-one">TrueAchievements</a> not only managed to spot Vanquish, but they also reported that Bayonetta was listed on the store. That too runs at 4K 60 FPS on Xbox One X and comes in at over 12 GB.</p>

      <p>The Bayonetta and Vanquish bundle is indeed real and should launch on February 18, 2020. It's unclear how much it's going to cost, but I'm going to get $50 to $60, with each game being around $25 to $30. However, only time will tell. Sega may decide to reduce the price further, but given the sheer demand for both experiences, that's probably unlikely.</p>
