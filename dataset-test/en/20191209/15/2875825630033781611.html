      <p>After topping the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> leaderboard with his first 40 of the series during the semi-final, former Emmerdale star Kelvin, 35, revealed that winning is now "anyone's game."</p>
      <p>The soap star opened up about his Strictly experience and his wife finally addressed her hubby's sensual routines during a festive family photoshoot with <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/2019120881662/kelvin-fletcher-wife-liz-baby-plans-after-strictly-hello-exclusive/">Hello! magazine</a> this week.</p>
      <p>Kelvin flashed his dazzling smile at the camera as he sat in front of a stunning Christmas tree with his beautiful wife Elizabeth, their daughter Marnie, three and adorable baby Milo, who celebrated his first birthday on Thursday.</p>

      <p>The former Emmerdale star's dances with professional Oti have often left the judges, who have praised his "sensual hip action", flustered on the hit BBC One show.</p>
      <p>Kelvin's wife Liz told the publication what she really thought about the routines.</p>
      <p>She shockingly insisted: "It doesn't bother me. I'm used to seeing him kiss Britain's sexiest females on Emmerdale.</p>
      <p>"I know the biggest part of a dance is the story and making it believable. I understand it's a performance."</p>

      <p>The brunette beauty's understanding of her hubby's performances continued as she explained: "I can imagine it's difficult for people who aren't in this industry."</p>
      <p>Asked about the possibility of winning the dance competition in this weekend's final, Fletcher said any of the final three are in within a chance of winning the coveted glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>He nervously said: "I genuinely believe it's anyone's game but it would be absolutely incredible."</p>

      <p>The father-of-two added: "It would be the biggest accolade I've ever received."</p>
      <p>Elizabeth, who tied the knot with Kelvin in a romantic wedding ceremony in 2015, will be supporting her hunky hubby this weekend as he battles it out on the dancefloor in the Strictly Come Dancing final.</p>
      <p>The semi-final saw comedian Chris Ramsey narrowly miss out on the final after losing to Karim Zeroual in the dreaded Strictly dance-off.</p>

      <p>So Kelvin will now face the final against soap star Emma Barton and her pro partner Anton du Beke and CBBC presenter Karim Zeroual and his dance partner Amy Dowden.</p>
      <p>In the final, the remaining three couples will be tasked with performing two of their favourite routines from their time on the show.</p>
      <p>They will also perform a show-dance that shows off the skills theyâ€™ve learned over the course of the series.</p>
