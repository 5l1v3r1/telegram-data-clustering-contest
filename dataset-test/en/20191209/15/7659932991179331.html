      <p>Morocco's former Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane said Saturday his country is not experiencing an ideal democracy, and “its government doesn’t rule.”<br/><br/>He stressed that politics is difficult in the country but not impossible.<br/><br/>“I have been away for a while, and I haven’t responded to any invitation to a lecture, symposium or festival for personal and partisan reasons,” he explained, considering that his words disturb “some.”<br/><br/>The Moroccan official said his country has a defined margin rather than a ruling government, adding that it also has “kind of a democracy with no open roads but paths through which a person can enter.”<br/><br/>His remarks were made during his intervention on the sidelines of a meeting organized by Tariq Ibnou Ziyad (TIZI) Initiative in Casablanca under the motto, “Education and Leadership...Pillars for the new development model.”<br/><br/>He recalled his experience as a premier, pointing out that he had run the government within the limits of the “constitutional and real powers.”<br/><br/>Nevertheless, he stressed: “We have spent some five years in peace, during which we were able to carry out a number of positive achievements for our country.”<br/><br/>He seemed to be comfortable while talking about the accomplishments during his tenure.<br/><br/>“I cherish the fact that after heading my country’s government for more than five years, the Moroccan people gave me confidence and 125 MPs instead of 105.”<br/><br/>“Before relieving me from my duties, the King praised my work, and the Moroccan people, in general, hold no grudges for me,” he added.<br/><br/>Benkirane also tried to motivate the youth to give more and work for the success of change and reform in the Kingdom.<br/><br/>He addressed them and said his achievements are the minimum, pushing them forward to work harder with patience and adherence to principles.<br/><br/>The official further expressed pride in his country, urging them to remain patient despite obstacles and difficulties.<br/><br/>He strongly criticized the absence of honesty in the Moroccan society, insisting that by adhering to values and ethics at work, Moroccans would be able to “improve the reality rather than changing it.”<br/><br/>Benkirane called for the need to adhere to trust in the state and its institutions for it to remain standstill.<br/><br/>“We live in a country that does not respond to all our requirements, hopes, and desires, but it is relatively better than other countries, and we should work to improve the level of trust,” he noted.</p>
