      <h1>Here's What to Get Everyone in Your Work Life for the Holidays</h1>
      <h2>Giving gifts that are meaningful to the individual receiving them is one of the most effective ways to enhance the workplace during the holidays.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:31:09+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Shama Hyder</a></address>
      <p>Every year, I curate my annual gift-giving guide for the professional world. The goal is to help you answer the question "What do I get my colleague -- or boss, mentor, assistant, client -- for the holidays?"</p>
      <p>When I first started creating my gift-giving guide, the main idea was to put gifts on professionals' radar that had the potential to enhance the workplace. That meant that tech-related gifts dominated my list. I'm still all about enhancing the workplace, but I now think that simply giving gifts that are meaningful to the individual receiving them -- tech-related or not -- is one of the most effective ways to go about this. During the holiday season, there are few things that can make a colleague or client feel more valued than a thoughtful gift. </p>
      <p>Last year, I focused specifically on <a href="https://www.inc.com/shama-hyder/heres-what-to-get-girl-boss-in-your-life-for-holidays.html">gifts for the girl boss</a>, but many of you have asked me to suggest gifts for those who fall outside this category. For this reason, I've expanded my gift-giving guide to include something for everyone in your work life.</p>
      <h3>For the Wellness Junkie: </h3>
      <ul>
