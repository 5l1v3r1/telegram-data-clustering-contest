      <h1>Celtic Christmas advert role for Plains youngster</h1>
      <h2>Dana Rennie, 11, is in the choir featured in the Parkhead side's viral festive film and charity single.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:37:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Jean Ward, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jean-ward/</a></address>
      <p>Plains schoolgirl Dana Rennie has scored with her singing debut on Celtic’s latest Christmas advert - which has gone viral with more than one million views.</p>
      <p>The St David’s Primary pupil was among the youngsters from the Glasgow-based UK Theatre School (UKTS) who successfully auditioned to become part of the children’s choir featuring on the club’s newly released charity single – a reworded version of the festive classic We Three Kings.</p>
      <p>Dana and her fellow students, who were kitted out in the team’s strips, sang the song under the direction of the choir master, Celtic manager Neil Lennon.</p>
      <p>The 11-year-old and her UKTS group filmed the video at Glasgow’s Mitchell Theatre as part of the club’s festive initiative to help families facing poverty this Christmas.</p>
      <p>Celtic fan Dana had “so much fun” during the filming of the video, and added: “Being involved in this advert has made my Christmas! It was great to meet the players and the team manager; it was so exciting.”</p>
      <p>And Dana’s proud dad Damien said: “It was an amazing experience for Dana, and surreal for me to see my daughter hanging out with Celtic’s first team and high fiving with Neil Lennon between takes.</p>
      <p>“They were all gentlemen and the production team was magnificent too.”</p>

      <p>The UK Theatre School, which is based in the city’s West Regent Street, has more than 700 youngsters enrolled in evening <br/>and weekend classes focused on the performing arts.</p>
      <p>UKTS principal Lizanne Lambie Thomson said: “For Dana and our other students, this was a great opportunity to be involved and see how a major full-scale music advert is produced.</p>
      <p>“This past year has been one of the busiest ever for our casting agency, and already there are students signed up for some big productions which will be hitting the screens in 2020.”</p>
