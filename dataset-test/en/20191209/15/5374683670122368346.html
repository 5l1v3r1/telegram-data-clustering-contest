      <p>Culture and Sport Minister Miri Regev (Likud) praised the conference scheduled for Monday evening in Petah Tikva.</p>
      <p>The conference, organized by Petah Tikva Mayor Rami Greenberg, will include local leaders from the Likud, as well as Yisrael Beytenu Chairman MK Avigdor Liberman.</p>
      <p>"I spoke a few minutes ago with my friend, Rami Greenberg, mayor of Petah Tikva, who is leading a meeting of mayors from the Likud this evening, together with Liberman," she said. "He is making another effort to bring Liberman home. I hope that Liberman recovers and prevents unnecessary third elections."</p>
      <p>"If indeed we are forced to hold third elections, I am glad that they will not be held on March 3, which is memorial day for those security forces whose place of burial is unknown. I am glad that we are preventing harm to the memories of the fallen and their bereaved families."</p>
      <p>If a coalition is not formed by Wednesday, elections will be held <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272908">on Monday, March 2, 2020.</a></p>
