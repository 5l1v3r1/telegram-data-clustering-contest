      <p>Speaking about her upcoming participation on the hit television show, Nationwide presenter Mary said: “I’m really looking forward to it, I’m quite petrified but I’m looking forward to learning new dances and doing something different.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been a fan and I’ve come out to watch the live show every year it’s been on so now it’s time to pony up and put my money where my mouth is,” she said.</p>
      <p>Kilkenny hurler Aidan Fogarty said he is excited, and nervous.</p>
      <p>“I feel really excited and really nervous. I’ve played in All-Ireland finals and I was coming up here today thinking I’d have taken an All-Ireland Final any day over this, but really excited and really nervous is probably the best way to describe how I’m feeling.”</p>
