          <b>Warner Bros. revealed the first trailer for next year’s <a href="http://insider.com/category/wonder-woman">Wonder Woman</a> sequel, “Wonder Woman 1984,” Sunday at Brazil’s annual Comic Con event, CCXP.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gal Gadot returns as superhero, Diana Prince, and director Patty Jenkins is back to direct.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Most surprising is that Chris Pine is somehow back as Prince’s love interest, Steve Trevor, even though he seemingly died at the end of the first film that took place decades earlier in 1918.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>This time around Wonder Woman will face off against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. She’ll also go up against iconic villain, Cheetah (played by Kristen Wiig). Pedro Pascal (“Game of Thrones,” “The Mandalorian”) joins the cast as well.</b>
        </li>

          <b>You can watch the first full trailer for the sequel below. It will be in theaters Friday, June 5, 2020.</b>
