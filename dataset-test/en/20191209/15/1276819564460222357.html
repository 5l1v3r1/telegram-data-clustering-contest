      <p>Sedona, Arizona, is known for its beautiful red rocks, steep canyon walls and pine forests.</p>
      <p>It's the perfect place to go hiking or camping for anyone looking for a nature-focused getaway.</p>
      <p>So, it might come as a surprise to see the red rocks and trees covered in a beautiful layer of snow.</p>
      <p>A snowstorm that blew through town transformed Sedona into a winter wonderland, as you can see in the video.</p>
      <p>Sedona is known to reach temperatures over 100 degrees during the summer. But in the winter, temperatures fall below freezing for long enough for the snow to stick.</p>
      <p>This is one of those videos that goes well with a cup of coffee, as the calmness of the drive through the snow generates a holiday warmth of its own.</p>
