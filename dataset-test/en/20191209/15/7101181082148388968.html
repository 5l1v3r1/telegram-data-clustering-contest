      <p>The <a href="https://www.etonline.com/awards/golden-globes">Golden Globes</a> makes room for everyone -- with separate categories for dramas and for musicals and comedies (or "comedies"), there are twice as many potential nominees -- but that doesn't mean everyone gets nominated. Especially when the always-unpredictable Hollywood Foreign Press Association is casting the ballots, you're guaranteed more than a few "<i>huh</i>"-worthy inclusions and omissions.</p>
      <p>With <i>Marriage Story</i>, <i>The Irishman</i> and <i>Once Upon a Time </i>dominating <a href="https://www.etonline.com/2020-golden-globe-nominations-see-the-full-list-137490">this year's motion picture nominations</a>, films like <i>Little Women</i> and <i>Us</i> ultimately missed out. (<a href="https://www.etonline.com/2020-golden-globes-biggest-tv-surprises-and-snubs-includes-game-of-thrones-zendaya-and-more-137643">And there were plenty more snubs and surprises on the television side.</a>) Scroll on to see this year's biggest surprises and most unexpected oversights.</p>
      <p><b>Snub: Where were all of <i>Little Women</i>'s nominations?</b> Pugh Crew, we're not eating good this morning. Not only was Florence Pugh inexcusably passed over in Best Supporting Actress, but the movie received a paltry two nominations in total: Saoirse Ronan in Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama and Best Original Score. Where was Greta Gerwig in Best Director? Where was Greta Gerwig in Best Screenplay? Why was <i>Little Women</i> not nominated for Best Motion Picture, Drama? History will not look back on this kindly.</p>
      <p><b>Snub: Justice for Nai Nai in Best Supporting Actress.</b> Pugh wasn't the only name missing off the HFPA's supporting actress list. Though <i>The Farewell</i> landed a nomination in the stacked Best Foreign Language Film field and Awkwafina earned a nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Comedy or Musical, Zhao Shuzhen -- the heart of the movie and, we had hoped, awards season -- was blanked, making room for <i>Richard Jewell</i>'s Kathy Bates and <i>The Report</i>'s Annette Bening. Somewhere, we hope she and Robert Pattinson are <a href="https://twitter.com/thumbelulu/status/1195195563664232448">consoling each other</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Surprise: <i>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</i>?!?</b> The entire Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy category is crazú -- Emma Thompson! Ana de Armas! Our girl Beanie Feldstein! -- but Cate Blanchett scoring a nomination for <i>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</i> is... We have to laugh. Though that means Constance Wu's under-recognized turned in <i>Hustlers</i> went unrecognized.</p>
      <p><b>Snub: Adam Sandler and Robert De Niro miss Best Actor.</b> Apparently the HFPA doesn't care if Sandler's gems are cut or not. What this means for his ongoing Oscars campaign will come into clearer focus following Wednesday's SAG Awards nominations. Likewise, though it felt like there was no nomination <i>The Irishman</i> didn't win, De Niro was noticeably absent from Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama, the fifth spot instead going to <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>'s Christian Bale.</p>
      <p><b>Surprise: <i>The Lion King</i> shakes up the animation race.</b> Yes, the "live-action" Lion King is a Best Animated Movie nominee, which is most noteworthy in what it might foretell of the Oscars: Disney's photorealistic remake won't compete for Best Animated Feature there, so while we're expecting to see most of the same names come Academy Award nominations -- <i>Frozen II</i>, <i>Toy Story 4</i>, <i>How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</i> and <i>Missing Link</i> -- the fifth spot remains up for grabs, it seems.</p>
      <p><b>Surprise: Todd Phillips squeezes into the Best Director race.</b> The HFPA had a lot of love for <i>Joker</i>. And though the nominations for Joaquin Phoenix in Best Actor in a Drama and for Best Original Score were expected, hearing Phillips' name announced in the Best Director field was...not. While Bong Joon-ho's inclusion makes it so the category isn't entirely white dudes, we have a feeling Natalie Portman <a href="https://www.etonline.com/natalie-portman-calls-out-all-male-best-director-category-while-presenting-golden-globe-93786">will not be presenting</a> this category.</p>
      <p><b>Snub? Surprise? What's the deal with <i>Cats</i>?</b> The movie picked up a single nomination -- for Taylor Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber's Best Original Song -- but was otherwise a no-show. <i>Cats</i> has big <i>The Greatest Showman</i> energy, so we thought it might follow suit with a Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy, nomination. Is <i>Cats </i>good bad? Or bad bad? Has anyone even seen <i>Cats</i> yet?</p>
      <p>The 77th annual Golden Globe Awards, hosted by Ricky Gervais, will air live coast-to-coast on Sunday, Jan. 6, at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET on NBC.</p>
