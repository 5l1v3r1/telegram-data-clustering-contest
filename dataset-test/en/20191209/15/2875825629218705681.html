      <p>The winning €6.8million <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/lotto">Lotto jackpot</a> ticket from Saturday night was sold in the village of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kilkenny">Mooncoin, Co Kilkenny.</a></p>
      <p>Bosses confirmed the Quick Pick ticket was bought on the day of the draw in the Blanchfield <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/centra">Centra store.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/national-lottery">Lotto</a> chiefs also revealed that the lucky punter has already been in touch.</p>

      <p>The winning numbers from the draw were 13, 16, 18, 25, 38, 41 and the bonus number was 1.</p>
      <p>And it was the second big win for the Centra in Mooncoin in the space of just a few months, after a €200,000 winning scratchard was bought there earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Owner Michael Blanchfield said: “It’s astounding news. What a way to finish the year – selling a winning Lotto ticket!</p>
      <p>"The news is the talk of the village and from talking to our local customers there is a great buzz about the place.</p>

      <p>"I’ve no idea who it could be as we have a lot of regular locals but I do hope it is one of them. Whoever it is myself and all the staff at Centra wish them the best of luck with their win.</p>
      <p>"We are in business here for 19 years and we had our first two major National Lottery wins in 2019. </p>
      <p>"Back in March this year we sold an All Cash Spectacular scratch card that was worth €200,000 and was won by a Kilkenny couple."</p>
