      <p><b>RUTLEDGE, Tenn. (WVLT) â€”</b> A Grainger County two-year-old was hit and killed after running into the street Saturday night, according to a report from Tennessee Highway Patrol.</p>
      <p>Records show Brentley Keelen's mother Samantha Burgess was cleaning out her car when she turned her back and the child ran into Indian Ridge Road. He was struck and killed by a Chevy Tahoe, investigators said.</p>
      <p>Burgess said this is something no mother should ever have to deal with.</p>
      <p>"I can't go home and see his toys everywhere and his bed beside mine it really hurts no mother should have to deal with this."</p>
      <p>The family said they need help to pay for a tombstone after the unexpected loss.</p>
