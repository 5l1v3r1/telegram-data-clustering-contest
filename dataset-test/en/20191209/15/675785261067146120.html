      <p>The winter weather has finally settled and it might be taking a toll on your skin.</p>
      <p>Which is why <a href="https://fave.co/2YGCkox">Cult Beauty</a> 's latest discount on <a href="https://fave.co/2YGCkox">Drunk Elephant</a> , a popular American skincare brand, has come at just the right time.</p>
      <p>The online beauty retailer now has 20% off on all Drunk Elephant products - from cleansers and oils to moisturisers and serums - which make great <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> gifts for any skincare fan.</p>

      <p>Founded by Tiffany Masterson, who wanted to avoid using toxins and the "Suspicious 6" (essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrance/Dyes and SLS), their range is certainly worth the hype.</p>
      <p>A great formula for the drying winter season, the <a href="https://fave.co/355azYN">B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum</a> is packed with firming and plumping ingredients - including niacinamide, amino acids and hyaluronic acid - and is down from £44 to £35.20.</p>
      <p>If you have dull skin, then the <a href="https://fave.co/2LEsv4S">C-Firma Day Serum</a> 's brightening antioxidant formula is worth a try and is now £53.60 instead of £67 - that's a saving of £13.40.</p>

      <p>Our favourite product is the <a href="https://fave.co/36hPZ7R">Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser</a> , which effectively melts away dirt and makeup whilst boosting radiance. It's originally £29 - but you can now get it for £23.20.</p>
      <p>The handy discount is perfect for those who are buying Christmas gifts for a beauty addict, or anyone who wants to add a few products to their own beauty arsenal.</p>
      <p>But you'll need to be quick, as the offer ends at midnight on December 9th.</p>
