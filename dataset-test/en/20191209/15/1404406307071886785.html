      <h1>Paul Pierce Loses $100,000 Lawsuit Over "Racist" Altercation at UFC Fight</h1>

      <p>In the past, Paul Pierce accused a security guard of being racist during UFC 229 in October 2018, and the whole encounter was captured on video. Since then, Christopher Mostello filed suit against Pierce for defamation, and now a judge has ruled in favor of Mostello, ordering Pierce to pay $100,000 to him.</p>
      <p>Mostello says because of Pierce’s allegation, his reputation took a hit and he’s been getting harassed ever since. The judge ruled in favor of Mostello because Pierce did not respond to the lawsuit.</p>
