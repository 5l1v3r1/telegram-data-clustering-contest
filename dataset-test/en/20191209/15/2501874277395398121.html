      <p>Santa Barbara has been featured in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-california/">Washington Post article</a> covering climate change in California.</p>
      <p>The article has an interview with the manager of the El Capitan Canyon Campground and how they've been negatively affected by fire and mudslides in the past few years. </p>
      <p>Research is showing that our once mild climate is growing hotter, drier, and windier creating intense wildfires, deadly mudslides, and extreme drought. Our area is warming at double the rate of the continental United States.</p>
      <p>"Since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius, according to The Post's analysis. Neighboring Ventura County has heated up even more rapidly. With an average temperature increase of 2.6 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, Ventura ranks as the fastest-warming county in the Lower 48 states," the article states.</p>
      <p>It's a very interesting read and I'm curious what other edhatters think. Here's the link to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-california/">full article</a>.</p>
