        <b>Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto says that he does not understand what happened to his team's pace between pre-season testing and the first race in Melbourne in 2019. The Italian giants left Barcelona after the eight days of testing in a positive mood, having looked the quickest of everyone.</b>

      <p>However, when they arrived in Melbourne for the season opener at Albert Park, it was not what they expected. </p>

      <p>Mercedes were streets ahead of the rest of the field, taking a 1-2, and Ferrari were even beaten to the podium by Aston Martin Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen.</p>
      <p>Binotto told <a href="https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/formel-1/f1-interview-ferrari-teamchef-mattia-binotto/">Auto Motor und Sport</a> that even they were confused as to what went wrong. </p>
      <p>The Ferrari boss said: <i>"After the winter testing, we had promised more, but the car was just not fast enough. </i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We still do not understand what happened between winter testing and Melbourne. Apparently, we have taken a step back, and the others have improved. We then found more downforce step by step."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ferrari went on to win three races after the summer break, but overall it was an underwhelming season for the F1 giants.</p>
