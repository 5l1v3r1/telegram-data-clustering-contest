      <p>Amanda Holden appears to have weighed in on the current “civil war” brewing within ITV’s This Morning.</p>
      <p>A number of complaints are alleged to have been made against host Philip Schofield, and his relationship with co-host Holly Willoughby has been described as “strained.</p>
      <p>Amanda reportedly made a jibe at the This Morning host on her Heart Breakfast radio show.</p>

      <p>“Lots of buzz around Philip Schofield at the moment. There are reports that things are a little tense between him and Holly Willoughby as well as Ruth Langsford. ITV says it’s just gossip and that he and Holly are great friends, both on and off screen,” said Ashley Roberts live on air, as she presented her showbiz segment today.</p>
      <p>“If only there was someone here who might be able to help us with that story,” joked Amanda’s co-host Jamie Theakston pointedly.</p>
      <p>“Listen, I’ve drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip,” Amanda replied.</p>

      <p>“Just give us some kind of…?” Jamie started hopefully.</p>
      <p>“Well I’m just gonna say that I really admire anyone that sticks up for themselves because it is not an easy thing to do,” Amanda said.</p>
      <p>“There is a tin opener and there’s a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener. That’s all I’m saying,” she added.</p>
      <p>Her comments come after it was reported that Friday’s ITV host Ruth Langsford made a formal complaint about Philip to ITV.</p>

      <p>He has been at the centre of a rumours about his workplace conduct for a number of months.</p>
      <p>ITV have denied any rumours, saying: “It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.”</p>
      <p>“Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise,” they said, in a statement to The Mirror.</p>
