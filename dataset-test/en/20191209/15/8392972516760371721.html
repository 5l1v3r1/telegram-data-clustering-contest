      <h1>Amanda Holden hails This Morning presenters for 'taking on' Phillip Schofield in new swipe at her TV foe</h1>
      <h2>She's spoken out on the latest round of tabloid allegations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:47:10+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Amanda Holden has waded back into her spat with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> after praising TV figures for allegedly 'taking on' the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> host.</p>
      <p>Phillip, 57, has been dogged by allegations <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/itv-slams-claims-phillip-schofield-is-feuding-with-this-morning-co-stars/">he is embroiled in a series of feuds</a> with his <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/daytime-tv/">daytime TV</a> co-stars, with reports claiming his relationship with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> has become strained and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ruth-langsford/">Ruth Langsford</a> has made an 'official complaint'.</p>
      <p>And despite suggesting her issues with Phil are in the past, Amanda looks to have opened up old wounds by having her say on the claims.</p>
      <p>Speaking on her Heart Radio show, Amanda admitted her public falling out with him may have helped open the doors for the series of stories about Phillip.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"Listen, I’ve drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip," she insisted. </p>
      <p>She then continued: "I’m just going to say I really admire anyone that’s going to stick up for themselves because it’s not an easy thing to do. </p>
      <aside>I really admire anyone that’s going to stick up for themselves.</aside>
      <p>"There’s a tin opener and a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener.</p>
      <p>"That’s all I’m saying."</p>

      </p>
      <p>It was reported over the summer that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/amanda-holden-allegedly-claims-overbearing-phillip-schofield-cost-her-tv-job/">Amanda had got the hump with Phillip</a> because he 'blocked' the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/britains-got-talent/">Britain’s Got Talent</a> judge from filling in for Holly Willoughby on the ITV daytime show while Hols herself stepped in to replace <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> during last year’s <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>A TV insider was quoted as telling The Sun: "Phillip actively campaigned for Rochelle Humes to get the job despite Amanda being more experienced — and having been told privately she’d got the gig."</p>
      <p>"She feels Phil unfairly used his powers of persuasion. She was told he’d chosen Rochelle because she was easier to ‘manage’ on air - and understandably that incensed her."</p>
      <p>"Things are increasingly toxic when the cameras stop rolling, and a few ITV people are secretly delighted that things are starting to emerge."</p>

      <p>Claims of a 'toxic atmosphere' resurfaced in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/itv-slams-claims-phillip-schofield-is-feuding-with-this-morning-co-stars/">the most recent round of tabloid allegations</a>.</p>
      <p>However, TV bosses have rounded on the reports and defended Phillip against the "malicious" claims.</p>
      <p>In a statement, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/itv-slams-claims-phillip-schofield-is-feuding-with-this-morning-co-stars/">an ITV spokesperson said</a>: "It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.</p>
      <p>"Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise.</p>

      <p>"Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike."</p>
      <p>Amanda later took a dig at Phillip on her radio programme when asked what three things she would not like to find in her home.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/amanda-holden-takes-swipe-at-phillip-schofield/">She replied</a>: "Spiders, flies and Phillip Schofield."</p>
      <p>ED has approached representatives for ITV and Phillip for comment.</p>
