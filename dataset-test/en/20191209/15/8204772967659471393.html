      <h1>Mainstream taps Rothschild for equity partner search</h1>
      <h2>Eddie O’Connor owns 55% of company</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:32:48+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/joe-brennan-7.3747169" target="_blank">Joe Brennan</a></address>
      <p>Eddie O’Connor’s Mainstream <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Renewable+Energy">Renewable Energy</a> has hired investment bank <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Rothschild">Rothschild</a> to find an equity partner, which is likely flush out takeover bids from major oil firms.</p>
      <p>The Irish Times had reported that Mainstream, which is focused on developing wind and solar projects in emerging markets, was seeing advisers to assess its business portfolio within a view to finding a partner. Sources have confirmed that Rothschild in London have been selected as the advisers.</p>
      <p>Mainstream currently has 1,500 megawatts (MW) of projects in construction across Chile, Egypt, Senegal and South Africa – the equivalent of about a quarter of peak demand for electricity in the Irish market.</p>
      <p>The company, where Mr O’Connor is 55 per cent shareholder, is set to see its pipeline under construction rise to 2,000 MW in the coming months, according to a spokesman. He declined to comment on the identity of the adviser.</p>
      <h3>Shareholders</h3>
      <p>The remainder of the company is owned by Mainstream’s management and a group of high-net-worth individuals, who have stuck with business since its establishment in 2008.</p>
      <p>While it is not clear whether Mr O’Connor and the other shareholders would be willing to exit at this stage, industry sources said that the most aggressive investors in clean-energy deals - big oil companies - would likely want full equity ownership.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Royal+Dutch+Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Total">Total</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=BP">BP</a> have been among the most active dealmakers in this space in 2019, as the world’s largest fossil fuel producers prepare for a transition to low-carbon energy.</p>
      <p>Mainstream says that it has a total global pipeline of about 9,000MW, which will “involve a multi-billion dollar, multi-gigawatt construction programme”.</p>
      <p>Mainstream, led by chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Andy+Kinsella">Andy Kinsella</a>, swung into a €487.5 million profit last year from a €5 million loss for 2017, driven by the sale of a Scottish offshore wind farm for up to €650 million to French utilities giant <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=EDF">EDF</a>.</p>
      <p>The deal allowed the company to repay all its debt and buy back shares and warrants held in the business by UK bank <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Barclays">Barclays</a>, Japanese trading house <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Marubeni">Marubeni</a> and Australian financial group Macquarie.</p>
