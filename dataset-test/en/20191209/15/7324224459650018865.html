      <p>It's been another busy year for classic bike enthusiast Andrew Davies, who says his 2019 campaign has been one of his best yet.</p>
      <p>The Stourbridge ace has spent most of his season racing in the Yamaha Past Masters championships, with the Bemsee racing club, bagging a best second-place finish at the final round.</p>
      <p>He also squeezed in a four-hour endurance race at Spa, in Belgium, as well as setting his fastest-ever lap around the Isle of Man TT circuit.</p>
      <p>Davies, who balances his racing while working as a finance director at a major Black Country business, is already plotting his return to the startline in 2020, aiming to be compete at the front end once more.</p>
      <p>"The main championship the Yamaha Past Masters, with Bemsee, aboard my bush-tec Yamaha TZR250 – and it's fair to say 2019 was a great year for me," said Davies.</p>

      <p>"I had my best-ever season finish of fourth place in the championship standings, which was topped off by a good final meeting at Brands Hatch, where I was in the top five every race and even got a second in the Sunday morning race.</p>
      <p>"I have done a lot of development work on the bike this year, which has helped get me nearer the front.</p>
      <p>"I've got to thank PJME.co.uk Wolverhampton for supporting me with top notch engine work, and lots of Dyno time with Dave Reynolds down at Projex in Cradley Heath."</p>
      <p>Alongside his success on the circuits across the UK, Davies also enjoyed a first foray of racing on the continent taking part in a four-hour endurance meeting at the world-famous Spa circuit in Belgium, with the Allspeed Team.</p>
      <p>"Looking back on 2019, the biggest challenges for me as a rider have been the endurance meeting" he said.</p>
      <p>"I had to learn the track and racing in the endurance format was something completely new to me too.</p>
      <p>"For the Allspeed Team to come away with fifth was mega, considering the much bigger teams we were up against from all over Europe. We were all well pleased."</p>

      <p>Next up for Davies was the Classic TT, which is raced around the same iconic 37.73-mile course as the main Isle of Man TT races, during the last week of the summer holidays.</p>
      <p>After entering the Lightweight Classic TT, he broke through the 100mph lap barrier but was forced to retire on the final circulation.</p>
      <p>"My Classic TT ride was another highlight, despite not finishing the race due to an ignition failure," he said.</p>
      <p>"Just to get some laps of that place puts such a huge smile on my face.</p>
      <p>“Practice week was a bit of a wash out, which restricted time on the bike, but I managed to get four laps in on the Friday evening.</p>
      <p>“Saturday of race day we managed one lap of practice in the morning and I achieved a 101.36mph lap, my first over 100mph, so I was well pleased with that.</p>
      <p>“The race in the afternoon was cut to three and we decided to refuel after lap one.</p>
      <p>"After a 101mph lap the pit stop was good, and then I managed a 98mph lap on the second but at Union Mills, on lap three, whilst in 19th position, the bike developed a misfire, meaning I had to retire at Ballagarry.</p>
      <p>“I was disappointed I didn’t get to finish, but the restricted practice week meant problems couldn’t be identified and rectified.</p>
      <p>"Still, we had a great time over there and we were pleased with the progress made with the bike’s performance and my lap times."</p>

      <p>Davies is now plotting his 2020 campaign, which will include more endurance racing abroad and a return to the Bemsee series.</p>
      <p>"I'll be hoping to start where I left off next year in Yamaha Past Masters series," he said.</p>
      <p>"The year 2020 also looks like bringing more endurance meetings in Europe with Allspeed Team."</p>
