      <h1>I've been sleeping on these $20 AmazonBasics sheets that have more than 20,000 online reviews — here's how they feel, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>A set of high-end sheets can cost hundreds of dollars. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9SCBKN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biip_080619_amazonbasics-sheets-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B06X9SCBKN&amp;amp;linkId=58ef59046cf47a9be0ebf641195f9cb8">AmazonBasics’s sheet set</a> isn’t exactly the height of bedding excellence, but it does only cost $20 for a queen size.</li>
        <li>The set comes in more than 40 colors and prints and includes a fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases.</li>
        <li>It’s soft and comfortable, but potential drawbacks are that it’s prone to wrinkling and overheating. Still, it’s hard to come by a better bedding deal than this $20 set.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are a lot of different ways to spend $20. You can buy dinner out or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-kitchen-gadgets-tools-under-25-dollars-2018-1">a kitchen tool</a> to help you make a meal at home. You can go see a movie. Or, you can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-places-to-buy-sheets-online-2018-10">sleep comfortably</a> at night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2KjWm2h">AmazonBasics</a>, Amazon’s private label for affordable everyday essentials, makes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9SCBKN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biip_080619_amazonbasics-sheets-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B06X9SCBKN&amp;amp;linkId=58ef59046cf47a9be0ebf641195f9cb8">sheets for just $20</a> (the price of a queen size set). The sheet set is one of the best-selling and top-rated on the site, with more than 20,000 reviews, 68% of which are five-star reviews. In terms of review cred, it’s bested only by this <a href="https://amzn.to/31jA3iY">Mellanni set</a>, which is $10 more expensive, and this <a href="https://amzn.to/31kZUaj">Sweet Home Collection set</a>, which is a few dollars cheaper.</p>
      <p>Like other AmazonBasics products, which include <a href="https://amzn.to/2H4lOXR">phone accessories</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwIg6D">cookware</a>, this sheet set sticks to the basics. There’s no marketing story behind it, no fancy, innovative features to wow you. It’s a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-sheets">sheet set</a>, plain and simple, and it has exactly the features you’d expect for $20.</p>

      <p>Each set includes one fitted sheet, one flat sheet, and two pillowcases. It comes in more than 40 colors and prints, from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QS8G4VH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biip_080619_amazonbasics-sheets-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07QS8G4VH&amp;amp;linkId=044ce064c4627cacf0a8baa5e8eedbd1">cute gingham</a> to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9SCBKN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biip_080619_amazonbasics-sheets-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B06X9SCBKN&amp;amp;linkId=58ef59046cf47a9be0ebf641195f9cb8">deep burgundy</a>, so it’s easy to find a color to suit your personal style. Some even cost less than $20. I already own a good number of lighter colored sheets, so I got a set in <a href="https://amzn.to/31nUE5W">Plum</a>.</p>
      <p>The sheets are made from polyester in an <a href="https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/apply-here/standard-100-by-oeko-tex">OEKO-Tex Standard 100-certified</a> factory. The fitted sheet was easy to put on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tuft-and-needle-mint-mattress-review">my 12-inch tall mattress</a> and stays snug around it. The sheet can fit on mattresses up to 16 inches tall.</p>
      <p>Overall, I’ve had a good experience sleeping on these sheets. They’re soft and comfortable, though they’re not the most breathable I’ve tried. Even though I tend not to sleep hot, I can see someone overheating in them. While some reviewers took issue with how thin the sheets were, I personally thought the thickness was fine.</p>
      <p>They’re also a bit wrinkly and that problem might be exacerbated by the fact that I got a darker color. If you care about the appearance of your sheets, I would suggest getting a lighter color or a printed style.</p>

      <p>Comparing these sheets to sets I’ve tried that cost 10 to 15 times more, I do think there’s a noticeable difference. Sheets that I’ve tried from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/casper-sheets-review">Casper</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/third-bedding-sheets-review-2018-4">Third</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/primary-goods-percale-sheets-review">Primary Goods</a> are indeed better – they’re softer, more breathable, and more durable.</p>
      <p>However, you really can’t beat the value of these sheets. Twenty dollars is a great deal for a full sheet set, and I love that there are so many color and print options. The soft and comfortable material might not last a lifetime of uses and washes, but it’s the perfect short-term bedding solution for kids’ bedrooms, dorms and college apartments, and guest rooms. It’s one of the best budget sheet options you can buy online right now, from a brand with a lot of experience making these types of affordable essentials.</p>
