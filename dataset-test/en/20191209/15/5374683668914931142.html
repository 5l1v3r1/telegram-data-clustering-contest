      <p>A Jordanian court on Monday sentenced a man to eight years in prison for allegedly plotting to attack the Israeli embassy in Amman last year.</p>
      <p>The state security court ruled that Khaled Abu Raya "threatened to carry out terrorist acts".</p>
      <p>According to the charge sheet the 33-year-old Jordanian planned "to open fire on the embassy and its employees in a bid to kill a large number of Israelis".</p>
      <p>The plot was alleged to be in response to the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed city of Jerusalem in May 2018, a major policy shift that outraged the Palestinian Authority.</p>
      <p>According to the charge sheet, it was also motivated by Israel's blockade of the impoverished Gaza Strip which has been rocked by anti-Israeli protests since March last year.</p>
      <p>The same court also sentenced another Jordanian, Munir Ibrahim, to three years in jail on Monday for allegedly planning to infiltrate Israel and attack soldiers in the Jewish state.</p>
      <p>Illegal crossings of the tightly secured border between Jordan and Israel are rare.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Jordan referred an Israeli to court on charges of illegally entering the kingdom and possessing drugs.</p>
      <p>Ties between the two countries, which are bound by a peace treaty, have been cool in recent years.</p>
