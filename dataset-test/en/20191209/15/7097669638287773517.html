      <p>PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) â€” Kosovo prosecutors filed terrorism charges Monday against three ethnic Albanians who returned to the small European country in May after allegedly joining the Islamic State group in Syria.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said the three are a man, his wife and his mother. They alleged the man fought with the extremist group before bringing his wife and daughter through North Macedonia and Turkey to Syria in 2014.</p>
      <p>The mother joined them in 2015, prosecutors said. The two women allegedly earned a monthly salary while serving IS members, but the whole family surrendered to Kurdish forces as the Islamic State lost ground in Syria, Kosovo authorities said.</p>
      <p>The three adults have been charged with organization and participation in a terror group. If convicted, they could face prison sentences of up to 15 years.</p>
      <p>In April, 110 Kosovo citizens were repatriated from Syria. Kosovo authorities say 30 of the country's citizens are still actively supporting terror groups in Syria.</p>
