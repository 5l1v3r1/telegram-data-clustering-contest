      <p>Old Dominion has hired Penn State offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne as its head coach.</p>
      <p>Rahne has been offensive coordinator at Penn State the last two seasons and on coach James Franklinâ€™s staffs with the Nittany Lions and Vanderbilt since 2011.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old former Cornell quarterback has never been a head coach.</p>
      <p>ODU is replacing the only head coach its football program has ever had in Bobby Wilder, who resigned after 11 seasons with a 77-56 record. Wilder led the program through its transition from FCS to FBS. The Monarchs went 1-11 this season.</p>
