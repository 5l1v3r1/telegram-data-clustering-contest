      <h1>Electric Picnic tickets sell out in less than three hours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:40:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/kevin-oneill/" target="_blank">By Kevin O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>Tickets for next year's Electric Picnic festival have already sold out — all 70,000 tickets were snapped up in just three hours.</p>
      <p>The line-up for the festival won't be revealed until next year.</p>
      <p>The capacity for the 2020 festival will increase from 55,000 to 70,000. It is one of a number of changes in what is shaping up to be the biggest overhaul of the festival in some time.</p>
      <p>The 2019 edition of the festival saw Billie Eilish, Hozier and the Strokes perform. The first festival took place in 2004. It was a one-day event with just 10,000 attendees.</p>
      <p>This year, a number of new areas were added to the festival, with more changes planned for 2020.</p>
      <p>The main arena is set to increase in size to accommodate larger crowds and there will be a new section called FishTown which will feature singer Jerry Fish and his Electric Sideshow.</p>
      <p>Body &amp; Soul will also end its 16-year association with Electric Picnic to focus on its own independent festival. A new area — Mind &amp; Body — will take the place of Body &amp; Soul, which had carved out a reputation as an oasis of calm in the middle of the festival.</p>
      <p>Avril Stanley, founder of Body &amp; Soul, said: "After 10 years as an independent festival, we have decided to step back from our presence and 16-year partnership with Electric Picnic so that we can refocus all of our attention to what the central idea behind Body &amp; Soul is all about: creating an intimate and collaborative festival of the future; one that can embrace social change in a hugely positive way while celebrating an important and ancient Irish feast in our own unique, stand-alone style."</p>
      <p>Body &amp; Soul's standalone festival will go ahead from June 19 to 21, 2020 in Westmeath, while they are also establishing a new winter festival: Ériu, which will take place in December 2020.</p>
