      <p>Lorraine Kelly triggered a slightly awkward moment during a chat with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> contestant Roman Kemp.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter was interviewing 26-year-old Kemp on her breakfast show this morning after he came third in the popular programme.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/roman-kemp-left-speechless-after-3622506">Hull Live</a>, Lorraine was keen to find out what Kemp got up to with his girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury after his three weeks in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The Scottish presenter asked: “Tell me, as soon as you got back to that hotel, and you gave Anne-Sophie a hug, what else did you do?”</p>
      <p>Before Roman had a chance to answer, Lorraine cut back in, saying: “Oh! You don’t have to tell me as much... I meant food and things like that.”</p>
      <p>Roman jokingly replied: “Yeah, Lorraine, come on.”</p>
      <p>The radio host then admitted he has been in a state of "pure greed" since the show ended.</p>
      <p>He said: “There was pizza ordered, fries ordered, just pure greed and elation at the same time.</p>
      <p>“I kept touching the floor and I was like, ‘It’s carpet, actual carpet’.</p>
      <p>“I turned on the shower and it’s hot water, and I’m looking at Soph going ‘it’s hot'!".</p>
