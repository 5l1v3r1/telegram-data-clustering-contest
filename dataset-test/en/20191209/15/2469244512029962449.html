      <p>A 38 year old smoker told a McDonalds worker that he was a 'refugee' and to 'go back to his own country'.</p>
      <p>Wayne Davies was drunk when he lit up inside the restaurant in Exeter's High Street and was asked to leave one evening last December.</p>
      <p>Davies shouted at worker Ben Sharma: "You are not worth £3. I bet they don't pay you. You are getting the sack.</p>
      <p>"Send that refugee back to his own country."</p>
      <p>Exeter magistrates court heard that it was an unpleasant incident which was racially aggravated.</p>
      <p>Davies, of no fixed abode, admitted racially aggravated intentional harassment and was given an 18 month long conditional discharge.</p>
      <p>Rob Jacobs, defending, said this was the second incident in the McDonalds involving Davies in three days.</p>
