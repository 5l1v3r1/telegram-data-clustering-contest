      <h1>Golden Globe nominations ceremony begins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:23:04+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The unveiling of Golden Globes nominees began on Monday in a ceremony marking the start of Hollywood’s annual awards season that culminates with the Oscars.</p>
      <p>The announcements will see the stars and movies destined for awards success start to break away from the competition — the Globes are seen as a key bellwether for February’s Academy Awards.</p>
      <p>Netflix is expected to have two frontrunners in “The Irishman,” Martin Scorsese’s three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic, and “Marriage Story,” the heartwrenching divorce saga starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver.</p>
      <p>Awards tracking site Gold Derby predicts strong competition from “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” Quentin Tarantino’s nostalgic love letter to 1960s Tinseltown, and Nazi satire “Jojo Rabbit,” also starring Johansson.</p>
      <p>The 77th Golden Globes, which also honour television, will take place in Beverly Hills on January 5, two days before voting for Oscars nominees ends.</p>
