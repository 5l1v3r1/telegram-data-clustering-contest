      <h1>Minecraft on PS4 is finally getting cross-platform play</h1>
      <h2>Follow Polygon online:</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:23:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Hall</a></address>
      <p>Beginning on Dec. 10, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> version of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/minecraft/1816"><i>Minecraft</i></a> will allow for cross-platform play. That means players across every major gaming platform — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/apple">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/android">Android</a>, as well as Gear VR devices — will now be able to play together in the same online world.</p>
      <p>After generations of exclusivity, default cross-platform play in modern video games is a relatively new concept. It began in earnest in late 2018 when Epic Games’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite/2417"><i>Fortnite</i></a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/26/17905770/fortnite-cross-play-ps4-nintendo-switch-xbox">helped convince the major console manufacturers to play nice</a>. Throughout 2019, more and more titles have piled on, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655472/destiny-2-cross-save-pc-xbox-stadia-ps4-platform-exclusives">including <i>Destiny 2</i></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/17/20871083/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-crossplay-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a>. Now <i>Minecraft</i> joins the fray, but there’s a twist.</p>

      <p>“PS4 players will now have their purchases and progress carry across platforms,” wrote Mojang’s Kelsey Howard in today’s press release. That means worlds, skins, min-games, and mas up packs available on the Minecraft Marketplace will all be accessible across every platform.</p>

That’s in part why Polygon named it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/7/20952214/minecraft-most-important-game-of-the-decade-2010">one of the most important games of the last decade</a>.</p>
