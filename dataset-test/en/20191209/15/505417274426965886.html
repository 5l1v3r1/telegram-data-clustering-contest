        <b>Lithuanian-born former Kerry minor Deividas Uosis caught the eye of scouts at the AFL Europe Combine held in UCD this past weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old’s parents emigrated to Ireland when he was four in search of work. Since then he’s gone on to star in Gaelic football, basketball and soccer.</p>
      <p>The All-Ireland minor winner, a talented outfield player in his own right, has been starring for Dingle between the posts this year and has been involved with the Kerry senior set-up.</p>
      <p>However, he could be set to follow in the footsteps of fellow Kerry All-Ireland winners, Dingle teammate Mark O’Connor and Tralee’s Stefan Okunbor, who have both moved to Australia in recent seasons to try their hand at AFL.</p>

      <p>Uosis led all comers on the day with a time of 2.76 seconds in the 20m sprint which included 0.92 seconds over the first five metres. He also placed fourth in agility testing with a 7.92. Both of those scores would have ranked number one at this year’s NAB AFL Draft Combine.</p>
      <p>Uosis also excelled in the endurance-based Yo-Yo test. His score of 21.5 was better than Hawthorn father-son recruit Finn Maginness, the Australian Combine’s best overall performer.</p>
      <p>AFL talent ambassador Kevin Sheehan was “super” impressed with Uosis but said the athletic testing was “only one part of it”.</p>
      <p>“Today we have the game sense and match play (after testing the previous day), but they’re elite athletes and as good as what we have in Australia,” Sheehan told <a href="https://www.afl.com.au/news/267176/lithuanian-born-and-lightning-quick-irish-prospect-stars-at-european-combine">AFL.com.au</a>.</p>

      <p>“You don’t jump to conclusions based just on someone’s speed time, but it does suit that they can break the lines and we are after fast athletes.</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s inspiring to be in this environment. The kids want to give it their best, alongside like-minded guys from all over the country who have played against each other but never met.</blockquote>
      <p>“They’re on a path that’s quite uncertain but exciting.”</p>
      <p>The top four rated Irish prospects will be flown Down Under to train in front of interested clubs in April 2020 while another two will test at the 2020 NAB AFL Draft Combine.</p>

      <p>It is the fifth straight year the AFL has held the European Combine in this format, with a record 17 Irishmen on AFL lists for the 2020 season – and another 18 in the AFLW competition.</p>
      <p>Among the other top performers of the 20 men at this year’s Combine were County Mayo pair Oisín Mullin and Matt Ruane.</p>
      <p>Ex-Collingwood and Down inter-county star Marty Clarke was present at the weekend and oversees training for Irish prospects throughout the year.</p>
