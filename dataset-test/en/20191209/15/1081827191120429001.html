      <h1>ROADTEST: I tried 7 size 14 black swimmers from Aussie retailers. This is what I found.</h1>

      <p>I’m just an average young woman really; I’m not overly tall or short, I’m a <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/why-dont-retailers-stock-above-size-14/">size 14-16 </a>with size DD cup, and I have the “you look so familiar” face.</p>
      <p>For someone who fits comfortably in the average, I wondered how easy it would be to find a pair of black swimmers to wear on the beach this summer. Considering lots of Aussie women are around my size, it shouldn’t be that hard to find a good fit…right?</p>
      <p>Wrong.</p>
      <p>I decided to head to my local shopping centre and check out some of the places that stock a decent size range. One thing I don’t enjoy is having to spend hours getting dressed and undressed in tiny change rooms while sweating it out like Kramer in the sauna in that <i>Seinfeld</i> episode.</p>
      <p>For the sake of my search, I stuck to trying on size 14 bathers the whole time to see how vast the difference was between stores. Behold, my findings.</p>
      <h3>Surf Dive N’ Ski.</h3>
      <p>My journey began at Surf, Dive N’ Ski; you’d hope a shop based on water itself would have a range of sizes to suit ALL beach bodies, but alas, they only stock up to 14.</p>
      <p>In their Seafolly bikini my boobs were about to concave on me it was so tight. Also what is this one piece low-back trend? Do people want to see my crack? My ass is already on display as it is.</p>

      <p><b>Cost</b>: $$$</p>
      <p><b>Variety</b>: Not much for 14+</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: Small</p>
      <h3>Bra's N' Things.</h3>
      <p>Next was Bras N’ Things. I felt confident going in as I knew their swimwear would reflect their accuracy in the bra department, but<i> why does everything have push up in it?</i></p>
      <p>Their range was vast in colour and style and I like that I was approached right away by staff.</p>
      <p>These styles were cute but I knew tan lines would be odd in the bikini set, and the one-piece wasn’t my cup of tea. Both fit well as a 14 and the change room lighting was decent.</p>

      <p><b>Cost</b>: $$.</p>
      <p><b>Variety</b>: Good for 14+</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: True to size</p>
      <h3>Myer.</h3>
      <p>My oh Myer.</p>
      <p>I had to approach a staff member to find the tiny swimwear section and that was my only encounter with a salesperson there.</p>
      <p>I grabbed another Seafolly bikini which to my surprise fit really well, and I fell in love with this Piper one piece that looks like it belongs on the Amalfi Coast.</p>
      <p>Prices were a little steep and the customer service was non-existent, so I left without a trace. P.S: Myer, please add locks to your change room doors.</p>

      <p><b>Cost</b>: $$$</p>
      <p><b>Variety</b>: Good style variety for 14+.</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: True.</p>
      <h3>Cotton On.</h3>
      <p>Cotton On, just bring the Curve range in-store already.</p>
      <p>I managed to ruffle through hundreds of bathers to find only one black pair in size XL – fit like a glove but again with the low back?</p>
      <p>The cupping wasn’t fantastic as it felt a bit flimsy, so I tried on a strapless one-piece in L and it was too big at the top. The sizing inconsistency was surprising and annoying but sales staff were attentive.</p>

      <p><b>Cost</b>: $</p>
      <p><b>Variety</b>: mainly online for 14+</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: Inconsistent</p>
      <h3>Target.</h3>
      <p>Ah Target, you had the BEST change room lighting of the day but your shelves were harder to control than my hair after a night out.</p>
      <p>I managed to scrounge through and find two bikinis, the first pair fit alright but the top was slightly tight, while the second top basically turned my boobs into what resembled a roll of cookie dough.</p>

      <p><b>Cost</b>: $$</p>
      <p><b>Variety</b>: Okay for 14+ if you have time to find it.</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: Small</p>
      <h3>City Chic.</h3>
      <p>City Chic, I was disappointed at the small range of sizes in your store compared to online.</p>
      <p>There were only two styles in black, so I tried the XS (14) one-piece which fit well in the body but my DD boobs didn’t fill it in. The bikini wasn’t doing things for me and I didn’t want another weird tan line.</p>
      <p>Change rooms had the worst lighting of the day as you can tell.</p>

      <p><b>Cost</b>: $$$.</p>
      <p><b>Variety</b>: Great for sizes 14+ online.</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: Generous.</p>
      <h3>Kmart.</h3>
      <p>And finally, old faithful Kmart. I wanted to end my day on a high whether I walked away with bathers or unnecessary Christmas decorations...I knew I’d be leaving in a good mood.</p>
      <p>Much like Target, the swim area was a mess, but their range of styles, colour and sizing was vast. I had plenty to choose from in black bathers, the one-piece was the most comfortable of the day with nice coverage, while the bikini set was comfortable. A little sexy but not too revealing – exactly what I had been looking for.</p>
      <p>Their sizing was consistent and good quality for the price.</p>

      <p><b>Cost</b>: $</p>
      <p><b>Variety</b>: Good for sizes 14+, just a little messy to navigate.</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: True</p>
      <p>If you’re more of an online shopper like me, I have found brands such as Artesands and Youswim offer a lovely variety of styles and colours with a great true-to-size fit.</p>
      <p>At the end of my shopping day, I walked away with two Kmart bikini sets for just $42, a kilo lost in sweat alone and a couple of thousand steps on my watch ticked off for the day.</p>
      <p>I hope this series of unfortunate shopping events doubles as a guide for any women who hate retail shopping as much as I do, but need swimmers for the hotter days ahead!</p>
