      <p>And today, officers confirmed a body had been recovered from the River Tay in Fife.</p>
      <p>The body was found near Newburgh around noon today - roughly 10 miles down the river from Michael's home.</p>
      <p>Formal identification has still to take place but the pensioner's family has been informed.</p>
      <p>The death is currently being treated as unexplained.</p>
      <p>At the time he went missing from the North Muirton area, Michael is believed to have been wearing a green fleece jacket and dark trousers.</p>
      <p>Inspector Mark Veal of West Bell Street police station said: “We are becoming increasingly concerned for Michael’s welfare and are keen to trace him as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“Given his age and the adverse weather over the past eighteen hours we would like to know he is okay and would urge anyone with information to contact us, or if Michael is reading this, please let us know you are safe.</p>
      <p>Anyone who may have seen Michael is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident number 1298 of Sunday, 8 December.</p>
      <p>We told you how the public has been warned after a restricted patient went on the run from a Glasgow hospital after failing to return.</p>
