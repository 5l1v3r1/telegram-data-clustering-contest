      <p>If there’s something strange in your small Oklahoma town, who should you call? The <i>police</i>! This is <i>2019</i>! A single mother (Carrie Coon) and her two children (Finn Wolfhard and Mckenna Grace) learn that almost immediately in the trailer for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/jason-reitman-is-making-an-original-ghostbusters-sequel.html"><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i></a>, which serves as a direct sequel to the first two films in the franchise. (With no disrespect to 2016’s ill-fated <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/08/bad-moms-ghostbusters-sausage-party.html"><i>Ghostbusters</i></a>.) When the trio is forced to move into a “creepy old farmhouse” they inherited from their family patriarch, some unnatural wonders of the area begin to confuse them: There are no fault lines, tectonic plates, fracking, or crazy-loud music within hundreds of miles, but the town is still shaking on a daily basis. Good thing the teens’ way-too-handsome science teacher (Paul Rudd) helps them figure out who their grandfather actually is, and why he owned dozens of ghost traps, a few beige jumpsuits, and an Ectomobile. Surprise! The film is expected to have a 2020 release.</p>
