      <h1>Clarks announces loss of 170 jobs just weeks before Christmas</h1>
      <h2>A spokeswoman confirmed 170 staff members will be made redundant and 80 of these workers are based at its Somerset headquarters in Street</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:45:20+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, Amardeep Bassey</a></address>
      <p>Clarks has axed 170 jobs just weeks before Christmas, the shoe giant has confirmed amid further fears of store closures.</p>
      <p>The redundancies come following changes to its business operations under a newly appointed CEO.</p>
      <p>A total of 80 job cuts have been made at its headquarters in Street - with affected workers told the news on Friday - just three weeks before Christmas, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/clarks-axes-170-jobs-just-21057561">Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>One woman, who did not want to be named, said: "On Friday, people were being let go from the headquarters, and we are talking hundreds."</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman confirmed 170 staff members will be made redundant and 80 of these workers are based in Street.</p>
      <p>"Clarks has introduced changes to its business operations in order to support its brand strategy under the leadership of recently appointed CEO, Giorgio Presca," a statement explained.</p>
      <p>"Today we have announced changes which affect the way our corporate teams across the world are structured which, regrettably, will result in approximately 170 colleagues leaving the business globally.</p>
      <p>"We are committed to working with all those affected by this decision to support them throughout this transition.</p>
      <p>"These changes do not impact our distribution centre operatives or stores."</p>
      <h3>Missed targets</h3>
      <p>Giorgio Presca replaced Mike Shearwood as the chain's new chief executive officer in March this year.</p>
      <p>Presca is responsible for all operational, financial and commercial aspects of the business and leads the Clarks strategy with the executive committee.</p>
      <p>It was announced in November that its factory in Street would close, at a loss of dozens of jobs.</p>
      <p>The firm, which opened the new "robot-assisted" technology factory in 2017, said it was because targets were not being met.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Clarks warned that store closures were also on the cards after its losses more than doubled.</p>
      <p>The 194-year-old retailer, which has more than 1,000 branches worldwide, said it may be forced to axe more branches amid tumbling profits.</p>
      <p>The latest accounts show sales fell 4.6% to £1.47billion, pushing losses from £31.3million to £82.9million in the past year.</p>
      <p>Clarks has 1,000 shops globally, with 553 in the UK and Ireland.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the retailer confirmed plans to axe its only remaining UK factory at a loss of dozens of jobs.</p>
