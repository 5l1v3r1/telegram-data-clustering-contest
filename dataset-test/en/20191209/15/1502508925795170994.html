      <h1>JNU fee hike row: HRD Ministry unlikely to interfere, won't issue directive</h1>
      <h2>The HRD Ministry may 'facilitate' a resolution but will not issue any 'directive'</h2>

      <p>The government is unlikely to make a direct intervention to resolve the issue between <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jnu">JNU </a>administration and students protesting against hike in hostel fees, official sources said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hrd-ministry">HRD Ministry </a>may "facilitate" a resolution but will not issue any "directive", they said.</p>
      <p>"Issuing a directive may be undermining their autonomy. We will facilitate the resolution rather than directly interfering in it," an official source said.</p>
      <p>The ministry last month set up a three-member committee to recommend ways to restore normalcy in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jnu">JNU </a>and mediate between students and university administration. The panel has submitted its report but the ministry is yet to take a call on it.</p>
      <p>The ministry last week asked the high-powered committee appointed by it to compare the hostel fee structure of JNU, after the second rollback, with other central universities.</p>
      <p>HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' informed Lok Sabha on Monday the government has not directed any central university to increase fees.</p>
      <p>His comment came on a day police lathicharged <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jnu">JNU </a>students when they tried to march to the Rashtrapati Bhavan to meet the president and urge him to ensure the hike in hostel fee is completely rolled back.</p>
      <p>The JNU administration on the other hand said in a statement the students have been invited for a talk but they have been "spreading false statements and not attending the meeting".</p>
      <p>The students have been protesting for over a month inside the campus against the hostel fee hike and have also called for a boycott of the upcoming semester exams, despite repeated appeals by the administration asking them to return to classes.</p>
