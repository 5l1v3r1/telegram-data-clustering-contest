      <h1>Dancing On Ice 2020 kicks off as Love Island's Maura Higgins glitters in gold</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:25:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Tilly Pearce</a></address>
      <p>The class of Dancing On Ice 2020 is officially in session and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maura-higgins/">Maura Higgins</a>, Caprice and H from Steps are leading the pack in their fabulous first look costumes.</p>
      <p>This year’s participants came out in force to give the first sneak peak of their skills on the ice after the announcements at the beginning of September.</p>
      <p>Naturally though, they had to do it with a hell of a lot of glitter and style.</p>
      <p>The women of the show, which is completed by Lucrezia Millarini, Trisha Goddard, Corrie Star Lucy George and Paralympian Libby Clegg, were dripping in jewels in co-ordinating gold outfits.</p>
      <p>Maura, who is still fresh from her time on Love Island this summer, is trading in her bikinis for something a bit more chilly – but naturally is still looking like she’s ready for a party.</p>
      <p>The star was the first to be announced this series, appearing from a snowglobe on This Morning to break the news.</p>

      <p>She was shortly followed on the same episode by Michael Barrymore, who today looked suited and booted as he arrived for his photo op.</p>
      <p>H From Steps was dressed in black-and-white and ready for action as he breaks records as the first celebrity to ever perform as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/16/john-barrowman-urges-lgbtq-community-support-dancing-ice-sex-pairing-10929005/">part of a same-sex couple this year.</a></p>
      <p>He’ll be partnered with American star Matt Evers, who last year teamed up with Gemma Collins for her stint on the show.</p>
      <p>Joe Swash, who left I’m A Celebrity: Extra Camp this year, looked nervous but smiled through it as he arrived at the event.</p>
      <p>The 2020 series will be getting a bit of a shake-up – after judge Jason Gardiner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/jason-gardiner-officially-quits-dancing-ice-following-bullying-row-clash-gemma-collins-10609522/">quit the show earlier this year</a>.</p>

      <p>‘I am so excited to be returning to the Dancing On Ice family,’ John enthused. ‘Unlike most I have been through the rigorous task of skating live as a contestant in the first series.</p>
      <p>‘This is a thrilling adventure for me and I hope to bring a Fresh, Fun and Fab-u-lous angle to the judging panel.’</p>

      <p>Ashley Banjo will remain on the judging panel alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean.</p>
      <p>Diversity star Ashley though may have to battle his heart over his head this year though – considering Perri Kiely, a member of his dance troupe, is also taking part on the series.</p>
