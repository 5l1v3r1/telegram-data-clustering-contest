      <h1>Mohammed Alshamrani: Saudi pilot who killed three sailors was ‘left infuriated after being called ‘pornstache’’</h1>
      <h2>Report says gunman made official complaint over derogatory nickname in class</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:52:58+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">Conrad Duncan</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SaudiArabia">Saudi</a> air force trainee who killed three sailors at a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/us-navy">US navy</a> base last week reportedly made an official complaint about being called “pornstache” by one of his instructors.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Alshamrani said he was left “infuriated” earlier this year when an instructor referred to him using the mocking nickname, according to the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>
      <p>The complaint has emerged as part of an investigation by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FBI">FBI</a> into the shooting at Pensacola naval base, which is being treated as a presumed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/terrorism">terrorist attack</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class,” Alshamrani said, according to a summary of his complaint.</p>
      <p>Although the complaint said the derogatory nickname was “Porn Stash”, he appeared to mean “pornstache”, referring to a style of thick moustache associated with porn actors.</p>
      <p>The incident reportedly took place at the end of a meteorology class, when an instructor asked students if they had any questions.</p>
      <p>The instructor then apparently turned to Alshamrani and addressed him by the nickname.</p>
      <p>“Laughing, he continued to ask, ‘What? Have you not seen a porn star before?’” Alshamrani wrote in the complaint, according to the <i>Times</i>.</p>
      <p>“After I did not respond, he just let go of the subject.”</p>
      <p>Managers for CAE USA, which provides training to civil and military aviation students, offered to have the instructor apologise but the Saudi trainee turned that offer down, according to the <i>Times</i>.</p>
      <p>The FBI declined to comment to the <i>Times </i>on the incident, which occurred in April, and investigators are still searching for a motive for the attack after Alshamrani was shot dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>It is not thought at this time that the derogatory comment is connected to the shooting.</p>
      <p>However, the incident was reportedly serious enough that two American students helped Alshamrani file his complaint.</p>
      <p>US media has reported that the Saudi gunman played <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mass-shootings">mass shooting</a> videos to others at a dinner days before the attack, according to an anonymous source briefed on the investigation.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> account which appears to match Alshamrani’s identity has also been flagged after anti-US posts were discovered on it.</p>
      <p>In one post, which quoted <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/OsamaBinLaden">Osama Bin Laden</a>, the user accused the US of “committing crimes not only against Muslims but also humanity”.</p>
      <p>FBI officials have conducted interviews with people who may have had contact with Alshamrani in an attempt to establish a motive for the gunman, who is thought to have acted alone.</p>
      <p>Alshamrani began training with the US military in August 2017 and was scheduled to complete his training in August 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/pentagon">Pentagon</a>.</p>
