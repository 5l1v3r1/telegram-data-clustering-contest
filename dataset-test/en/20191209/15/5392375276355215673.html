      <p>For those who have forgotten about Meizu’s phone, let’s have a quick recap. The smartphone was launched back in November of 2016 and it featured a full metal unibody design; it was also available in three color variants: champagne gold, deep space gray and moonlight silver. The handset then had a 2.5D curved glass at the front, with a fingerprint scanner / home button beneath it. Finally the PRO 6 Plus also sported an heart rate monitor on the back.</p>
