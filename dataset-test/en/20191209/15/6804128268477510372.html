      <h1>Michail Antonio starts, Sebastien Haller axed - West Ham predicted team vs Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>We think Manuel Pellegrini will opt for a couple of changes for the game against the Gunners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:30:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham take on Arsenal in a crunch London derby on Monday night when two badly out of form teams face off in the east of the capital.</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini's West Ham team has won just one of their last ten games, the victory against Chelsea a week ago, while Arsenal havenâ€™t won in nine outings which is their worst run in 30 years.</p>
      <p>The Hammers saw off Chelsea but were then beaten by Wolves in midweek, going down 2-0 at Molineux. Freddie Ljungberg has replaced Unai Emery at the helm in north London but has yet to pick up a win in his two games as boss, drawing with Norwich and then losing to Brighton on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The only new injury concern for the Hammers from the Wolves loss is that of Robert Snodgrass, who injured himself when he missed a sitter in the second half and was substituted off with a suspect shin problem.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio has seemed ton hint he is available for selection in an interview with the Hammers official website over the weekend but whether Pellegrini takes the risk on his remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>With the injury news we have, here is our predicted team for the game on Monday:</p>

      <p>We have made two changes to our team and that is the recall of Michail Antonio at the expense of Sebastien Haller from the team that lost to Wolves.</p>
      <p>Haller struggled once again but obviously it all depends on Antonio's fitness. If he doesn't make it the Haller should start up front on his own despite his poor form.</p>
      <p>The other switch is with Robert Snodgrass making way and Andriy Yarmolenko starting in his place on the wing, providing the Scotsman is not fit enough to start.</p>
      <p>The rest of the team is unchanged from the Wolves game, with Felipe Anderson playing in the number ten role once again and Pablo Fornals off the left with Yarmolenko on the opposite flank.</p>
      <p>Issa Diop travelled to Wolves but was not in the squad following his one match ban but he is likely to return to the match day 18 on Monday.</p>
