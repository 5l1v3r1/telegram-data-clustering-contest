      <p>The <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-fi-offering-new-customers-month-free-service">Google Fi</a> MVNO service has been around for a few years now, and it aims to give customers a reasonably-priced alternative to traditional carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon while offering a few of its own perks. While Google Fi is technically supported on a <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/project-fi-is-now-google-fi-supporting-iphones-and-majority-of-android-devices">broad range of Android</a> and iOS devices, Google has reserved the complete Google Fi experience to Pixel devices and what it calls "Designed for Fi" smartphones (like those from Motorola).</p>
      <p>Today, Google announced that <i>all</i> smartphones that are supported on <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google-fi">Google Fi</a> will receive a number of features previously reserved for a select few. Now, all Google Fi devices, including the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/iphone">iPhone</a>, support spam call warnings along with the ability to block specific phones numbers from reaching out to you. </p>

      <p>The next two features, however, are reserved just for Android devices. Google’s enhanced virtual private network (<a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/vpn">VPN</a>) securely encrypts both your Wi-Fi and cellular traffic to disguise your online activity. "Our enhanced network automatically detects when your Wi-Fi connection becomes unusable and then fills in those connection gaps with cellular data," writes Google. <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google">Google</a> is quick to point out that even it cannot ascertain your online whereabouts when this feature is enabled.</p>
      <p>"If you’ve ever left your house and walked toward your car, you might have noticed your connection slows or even stops altogether as your phone clings to a weakened Wi-Fi connection. With our enhanced network, you’ll have a seamless connection on the go."</p>
      <p>One last feature that Google is adding for all Android devices on Google Fi is <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/wi-fi-calling">Wi-Fi calling</a>. With this feature, you can still make or receive phone calls even if you don't have a cellular signal as long as you have a stable <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/wi-fi">Wi-Fi</a> connection.</p>
      <p>Google says that all of these features can be enabled by downloading the latest version of the Google Fi app for your device.</p>
