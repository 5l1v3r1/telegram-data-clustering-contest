      <p>Officers launched an appeal at the end of November after a pair of garden ornaments were stolen from a garden in the townâ€™s Blackthorn Place.</p>
      <p>The incident had taken place overnight on November 18.</p>
      <p>But police have now confirmed that two boys have been traced and the ornaments returned to their home in the new housing estate.</p>
      <p>Due to being below the age of criminal responsibility, the boys were each issued with a warning by officers.</p>
