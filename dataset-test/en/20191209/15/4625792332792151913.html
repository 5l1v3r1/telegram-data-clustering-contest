      <p>Twitter is standing by its decision to temporarily suspend <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> host Pete Hegseth after he posted the Pensacola terrorist's manifesto on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>Hegseth, 39, was temporarily banned on the social media platform over the weekend for sharing the manifesto of Saudi national Mohammed Alshamrani, who killed <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/man-who-shot-up-naval-air-station-pensacola-was-a-saudi-aviation-student">three people and injured 12 more</a> when he <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/man-who-shot-up-naval-air-station-pensacola-was-a-saudi-aviation-student">opened fire</a> at Navy Station Pensacola on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Fox News host revealed the suspension on Instagram, where he posted a photo of the tweet that got him suspended with the caption, "Yesterday, I was BANNED from [Twitter] — because I posted a screen shot of the terrorist from Florida tweet his Islamist motivations. That's it, a screen shot of a terrorist in his own words. If they can ban me, they will ban anyone. We need to fight back. Heck, I posted the terrorist screen shoot on this post too, so stay tune for [Instagram] banning me too," he went on. "Big tech does the bidding of the Left, especially to include anyone who speaks truth about the threat of radical Islam."</p>
      <p>A Twitter representative defended the platform's decision to ban <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pete-hegseth-getting-married-to-fox-colleague-at-trump-golf-club">Hegseth</a>, who is a former Amy National Guard officer, telling the <i>Washington Examiner </i>that posting the manifesto is a violation of the Twitter rules and added that they enforce their policies "judiciously and impartially" for all Twitter users. They declined to comment on the length of Hegseth's suspension.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-groups">Twitter's</a> "Terrorism and violent extremism policy," no user is allowed to "threaten or promote terrorism or violent extremism," and they list four examples that violate the policy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>engaging in or promoting acts on behalf of a terrorist organization or violent extremist group;</li>
        <li>recruiting for a terrorist organization or violent extremist group;</li>
        <li>providing or distributing services (e.g., financial, media/propaganda) to further a terrorist organization’s or violent extremist group’s stated goals; and</li>
        <li>using the insignia or symbols of terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups to promote them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Alshamrani's social media accounts, which are no longer active, showed anti-Israel posts, and he had posted a quote from Osama bin Laden. His manifesto accused the United States of having "turned into a nation of evil," however he added that he's not "against you for just being American," but "I hate you because every day you [are] supporting, funding and committing crimes not only against [M]uslims, but also humanity."</p>
