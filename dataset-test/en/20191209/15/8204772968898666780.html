      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=HSBC">HSBC</a> Holdings’ interim chief has overhauled the sprawling bank’s senior management team as he positions himself to take the job on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>The London-based bank, which derives most of its earnings from Asia, is replacing its top investment banker, chief operating officer and chief risk officer, according to a statement Monday. The moves come before interim CEO <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Noel+Quinn">Noel Quinn</a> unveils a wide-scale restructuring next year that’s expected to close parts of the business and divest operations including the French retail unit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Andy+Maguire">Andy Maguire</a> will retire in January after five years as COO, replaced by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=John+Hinshaw">John Hinshaw</a>, a former executive at Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Chief risk officer <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Marc+Moses">Marc Moses</a> will hand over his responsibilities to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pam+Kaur">Pam Kaur</a>, who currently heads wholesale market and credit risk. Details of the overhaul will be announced along with HSBC’s full-year results in February.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinn has made a bid to get the top job on a permanent basis and is considered a front-runner. Before chairman <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mark+Tucker">Mark Tucker</a> tapped him as interim chief, Mr Quinn was head of global commercial banking. He previously ran the Asia-Pacific commercial bank. – Bloomberg</p>
