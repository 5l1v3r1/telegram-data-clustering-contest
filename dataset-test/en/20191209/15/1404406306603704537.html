      <p>Update 12/09/2019 3:27pm:</p>
      <p>Nick Cannon recently responded to Eminem’s bars directed at him on Fat Joe’s “Lord Above” track with the diss record “The Invitation.” On the track, Cannon says he heard there was a gay sex tape featuring Eminem performing oral sex on a man, and now Cannon has revealed that Eminem’s lawyers have contacted him over the bar.</p>
      <p>HotNewHipHop tweeted out a link to Cannon’s diss record along with the tweet “Nick Cannon isn’t playing around with Eminem.” The tweet highlighted the bars about the gay sex tape, which led Cannon to respond by saying “FACTS! His lawyers didn’t want that one out! They already on my line 😂.” Take a look above.</p>

      <p>Suge Knight hopped on Nick Cannon's official Eminem diss track, "The Invitation," which he dropped today (December 9). The Hitmaka-produced track also features Hitman Holla, Charlie Clips and Prince Eazy.</p>
      <p>Suge Knight starts out the track in a phone call to Nick that was recorded from jail, where he states, "You know I don't do no talking, but Nick is family," adding "Eminem's a b*tch!" </p>
      <p>Nick then rhymes on the track, "Call Kim, somebody get Hailey and that other kid you raising that ain't even your baby. Took a page out of Drake book, this might get a Grammy/We going back to back until you respond—on the family/My baby mama killed you off a decade ago/You still crying about it b*tch, now who really the hoe?"</p>
