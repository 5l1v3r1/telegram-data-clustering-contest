      <h1>Ankit, Kalaivani lead India to six boxing gold medals at SAG</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:47:47+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>KATHMANDU: National champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ankit-Khatana">Ankit Khatana</a> (75kg) and rising star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kalaivani-Srinivasan">Kalaivani Srinivasan</a> (48kg) led India to six boxing gold medals even as World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik settled for a silver medal at the 13th <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/South-Asian-Games">South Asian Games</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>In men's category, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vinod-Tanwar">Vinod Tanwar</a> (49kg), <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sachin-Tendulkar">Sachin</a> (56kg) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gaurav-Chauhan">Gaurav Chauhan</a> (91kg) were the others who finished on top, while Parveen (60kg) was the other woman pugilist to take the gold for India.</p>
      <p>In the men's 49kg final, Bhutan's Tashi Wangdi proved no match for Tanwar, who easily cruised to a 5-0 win.</p>
      <p>Sachin was equally impressive and hardly broke a sweat against Bangladesh's Mia Md Robin in 56kg, soaring to a win by the same scoreline.</p>
      <p>Khatana was unstoppable and stamped his authority over Sri Lanka's Dinesh Maduranga Don Pathirage in the middleweight summit clash on his way to a commanding 5-0 victory.</p>
      <p>Gaurav Chauhan faced some stiff resistance from Pakistan's Sanaullah early on in their 91kg face-off but was soon able to find his punches that helped him notch up a 4-1 win.</p>
      <p>While his compatriots performed upto the expectations, it was Manish Kaushik's 64kg final loss that was the biggest surprise for the entire contingent.</p>
      <p>Kaushik was at his menacing best throughout the tournament but was outdone by Nepal's Bhupendra Thapa, who recorded a huge 5-0 upset win.</p>
      <p>"Today man of the match goes to Vinod Tanwar in my view, opponent was a rough puncher. He took him very easy by step back punch and side step punch and won the match by 5:0.</p>
      <p>"Manish's opponent was very rough and he received 1 or 3 clear punches. It was unfortunate but this tournament was definitely a good experience for him," said India's men's boxing chief coach, CA Kuttappa.</p>
      <p>The women, in contrast, had to fight hard for the gold.</p>
      <p>One of the most promising talents, Kalaivani showed her resilience in her 3-2 victory over Nepal's Maharjan Lalita in 48kg.</p>
      <p>Parveen too showed her guts and gumption in a brave 3-2 triumph over Nepal's Sunar Sangita in 60kg but 2017 Asian Championship bronze medallist Shiksha bowed out 0-5 to Minu Gurung of Nepal in 54kg.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Vikas Krishan (69kg), Narender (+91kg), Sparsh (52kg), Varinder (60kg) will be aiming for the gold from the men, while Pinki Rani (51kg), Sonia Lather (57kg), and Manju Bamboriya (64kg) will be hoping for a top-podium finish in women's category.</p>
