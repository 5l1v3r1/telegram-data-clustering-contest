      <p>It’s almost 40 years since John Lennon was tragically murdered.</p>
      <p>On yesterday’s anniversary his sons Sean and Julian both took to Instagram to post vintage snaps of them with their late Beatle father.</p>
      <p>Their mum, John’s widow Yoko Ono, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/yoko-ono-describes-hollowing-experience-of-losing-john-lennon-on-anniversary-of-beatles-death-11414425/">also paid an emotional tribute to the musician</a>.</p>
      <p>Sean, 44, posted a throwback childhood photo on Sunday but left the caption blank.</p>

      <p>His older half-brother Julian, 56, posted a family photo where he is seen riding a bike with John sitting down.</p>
      <p>He accompanied the picture with the caption: ‘Wish You were here…. In Loving Memory.’</p>

      <p>Underneath Sean’s photo, Lindsay Lohan commented with two heart emojis and a praying hand emoji, and Mark Ronson left a few heart emojis.</p>
      <p>Current US Presidential Democratic candidate Tulsi Gabbard wrote: ‘Sending you love and prayers today.’</p>
      <p>Sean later shared another post explaining how the family spent the difficult day with a Japanese tea ceremony.</p>

      <p>Underneath a photo of his cousin Akiko in traditional dress, he wrote: ‘Today my beautiful cousin Akiko performed a Japanese Tea Ceremony for my mother, my uncle, my sister, and my other cousins, in honor of my father.</p>
      <p>‘Behind her was a custom scroll she had made out of an old drawing my father had given her when we were kids. The tea bowl with which she served my mother she had designed and decorated for this day with exactly 9 peace signs. When the matcha was finished there was another surprise revealed to be written at the bottom of the bowl: ‘i ii iii’ something <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yokoonoofficial/">@yokoonoofficial</a> fans will recognize as signifying the words ‘i love you’ from her Onochord piece.</p>
      <p>‘The level of thoughtfulness and consideration, the meticulousness and beauty were truly breathtaking. What had begun as a difficult day for our family has left me feeling incredibly grateful. Thank you Akiko, and thank you everyone for your kind words.’</p>
      <p>The former Beatle was shot and killed by Mark Chapman outside his New York City apartment in 1980 at age 40.</p>
      <p>Last year the American murderer was denied parole for the tenth time.</p>
      <p>Sean is the only child of John and Yoko, while Julian’s mother was John’s first wife, Cynthia.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/ringo-starr-still-gets-emotional-bard-shot-john-lennon-recalls-beatles-death-11014723/">Ringo Starr said he still gets emotional over the tragic killing of his bandmate</a>.</p>
