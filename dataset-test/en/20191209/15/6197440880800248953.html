      <h1>Withings fitness trackers can now sync sleep data w/ Google Fit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:12:14+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Google Fit is a pretty basic health/fitness suite, but it’s more than enough for many users. If you happen to own a Withings fitness watch, the latest update for the app is bringing support for syncing your sleep data with Google Fit.</p>
      <p>The latest app update from Withings which is now available <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.wiscale2">on Google Play</a> (via <a href="http://androidpolice.com/2019/12/09/withings-app-gets-dark-mode-sleep-sync-to-google-fit-strava-integration/"><i>Android Police</i></a>) brings along with it a handful of upgrades. One of those is support for a dark theme in the app which comes alongside better overall support for Android 10. And, yes, it supports <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/11/android-10-apps-dark-theme/">the system-wide toggle</a> too.</p>
      <p>More importantly, though, this update is also bringing support for Withings users to export their sleep data to Google Fit. This is in addition to Fit support for activity, daily steps, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure too. Withings is also enabling Strava integration with this update as well.</p>
      <p>The full changelog for the update is available below and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.wiscale2">Withings Health Mate app is on Google Play</a>.</p>
