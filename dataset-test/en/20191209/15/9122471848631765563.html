      <h1>Colts Kicker Adam Vinatieri To Undergo Knee Injury, Miss Rest Of Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:08:10+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Indianapolis Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri has been one of the most reliable players in the NFL for over two decades now. But the 46-year-old’s career could be over after a recent diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Vinatieri, who missed his team’s game this past Sunday for the first time since 2010, will undergo knee surgery and miss the rest of the season. ESPN’s Adam Schefter was the first to report the news.</p>
      <p>Vinatieri has been inconsistent this year, but he managed to hold onto his job until the injury. It’s unclear if he plans to return after surgery, but he’ll be 47 years old in a few weeks.</p>
      <p>Vinatieri will be placed on IR.</p>

      <p>Vinatieri is one of the most (if not the most) successful kickers in NFL history. He won three Super Bowl titles for the New England Patriots and added a fourth with the Colts. He has the most career field goals made and the most career points in league history.</p>
      <p>Ahead of this past Sunday’s game, the Colts picked up Chase McLaughlin off waivers. He kicked for the team against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>

      <p>This season, Vinatieri will finish 17-of-25 on field goals and 22-of-28 on PATs. The Colts currently have a 6-7 record.</p>
