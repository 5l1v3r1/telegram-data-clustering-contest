      <p>Still figuring out your <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20803105/race-finder/">race plans</a> for 2020? Consider an event that you and the whole family will love. This February, Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, will be hosting the <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/events/running-universal-orlando">Running Universal Epic Character Race 5K &amp; 10K at Universal Orlando Resort</a>, the first race event ever held in the amusement park.</p>
      <p>The 5K and 10K races will be held on the weekend of February 1, 2020. Unlike at other races, runners here will have a unusual crew to cheer them on: bubbly minions from <i>Despicable Me</i>, Velociraptor Blue from <i>Jurassic World</i><i>, </i>our favorite ogre and his friend Donkey from <i>Shrek</i>, and <i>Transformers </i>Autobots and Decpticons, among other recognizable characters.</p>
      <p>The races will traverse most of the park, making its way through the villages of New York City and San Francisco, past the Port of Entry with its famous Pharos Lighthouse, and into Seuss Landing, which is home to the Cat in the Hat and other Dr. Suess characters. Runners participating in the 10K will also adventure through Jurassic Park and Toon Lagoon, where they should beware of roaming dinosaurs and a spinach-fueled Popeye.</p>
      <p>Registration is currently open, with entry fees beginning at $82 for the 5K and $121 for the 10K. Discounts are available for Universal Studios pass holders and team members. For the ultimate race experience, you can purchase a VIP race upgrade ($142 for 5K and $181 for the 10K), which includes a meet-and-greet and a post-race breakfast with the Universal characters as well as various options for hotel accommodations, including the new Endless Summer Resort.</p>
