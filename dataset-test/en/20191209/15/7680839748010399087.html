      <p>The trucking bloodbath of 2019 is ending on a remarkably sour note.</p>
      <p>Celadon, a truckload carrier that grossed $1 billion as recently as 2015, will file for bankruptcy on Wednesday or earlier, inside sources <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/celadon-biggest-bankruptcy-in-truckload-history-expected-by-mid-week">told the leading industry publication FreightWaves</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>It’s poised to be the largest truckload bankruptcy in history – and the company’s drivers are already getting slammed.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The bankruptcy has the potential to leave more than 3,200 truck drivers stranded away from home. Sources told Business Insider that Celadon truck drivers’ fuel cards were already being turned off, leaving them unable to get home without spending serious cash on gas or arranging their own transport by car, plane, or bus.</p>
      <p>An internal source <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/celadon-biggest-bankruptcy-in-truckload-history-expected-by-mid-week">confirmed to FreightWaves</a> that the company might not be able to get drivers home on time and encouraged them to fill their tanks as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Numerous Facebook groups, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/610593433023370/?multi_permalinks=611743029575077%2C611742492908464%2C611741932908520%2C611725722910141%2C611739392908774&amp;amp;notif_id=1575848322274102&amp;amp;notif_t=group_activity">Celadon Closure Assistance and Jobs</a>, have been set up to help stranded Celadon truck drivers connect. Celadon did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.</p>
      <p>2019 has been a challenging year for truck drivers and their employers. About 640 trucking companies went bankrupt in the first half of the year, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trucking-company-shutdowns-grow-as-shipping-market-cools-11567104495">according to industry data from Broughton Capital LLC</a>. That’s more than triple the roughly 175 bankruptcies from the same period last year.</p>

      </p>
      <p>ACT Research has said America’s $800 billion trucking market entered a recession early this year. Freight volumes have declined <a href="https://www.joc.com/trucking-logistics/truckload-freight/us-freight-volumes-decline-amid-mixed-economic-signals_20191115.html">for 11 straight months</a>. Manufacturing, which tracks the trucking industry, has contracted <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-manufacturing-sector-weakens-further-in-november---ism-2019-12-02">for four straight months</a>.</p>
      <p>The source of Celadon’s troubles dates back further, however. On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former Celadon executives following a multiyear accounting scandal.</p>
      <p>The news plunged Celadon’s stock to $0.41 a share on Friday – a considerable tumble from the more than $20 a share that the stock was worth in 2015 before the accounting scandal became public knowledge.</p>
