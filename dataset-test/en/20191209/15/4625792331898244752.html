      <h1>House Judiciary GOP: Where’s the impeachable offense?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:12:25+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">Susan Ferrechio</a></address>
      <p>House Republicans argued President Trump has not conducted an impeachable offense and said Democrats are trying to eject him for political reasons.</p>
      <p>“It’s all political,” said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, on Monday.</p>
      <p>“What’s their motive?” Collins said. “It’s November 2020. Because they cannot get over President Trump is the president of the United States, and they don’t have a candidate who can beat him.”</p>
      <p>The Judiciary Committee convened Monday to hear evidence presented by Democrats about a “scheme” by Trump to get Ukrainian government officials to investigate Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and the Democrats.</p>
      <p>Democrats made the case that Trump conditioned critical security aid and a White House meeting on Ukraine's promise to open the investigations.</p>
      <p>Collins said Trump did nothing wrong and delivered the aid without requiring any action by Ukraine. He argued that Trump was concerned about Ukraine’s problem with rampant corruption.</p>
      <p>The White House put a hold on the security aid for 55 days. The $391 million was released to Ukraine on Sept. 11. Trump told Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, he did not seek a "quid pro quo" from Ukraine, but Democrats suggest Trump made the statement to cover his tracks.</p>
      <p>Collins called the impeachment case “a fairy tale,” and said Judiciary Democrats are ignoring House rules by denying Republicans a day to hold their own hearing before the panel takes up articles of impeachment as early as this week.</p>
