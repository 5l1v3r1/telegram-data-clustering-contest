      <p>A Devon winery is teaming up with Aldi to provide the supermarket giant with sparkling wine in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Lyme Bay Winery is working on the English sparkling wine for the supermarket’s ‘Exquisite Collection’.</p>
      <p>The ‘Lyme Block Sparkling Brut Reserve’ launches on December 9, in time for the vital Christmas and New Year period for sparkling wine sales.</p>
      <p>The new wine follows on from the success of the ‘Lyme Block English Wine’, launched in March and then a ‘Lyme Block Bacchus’.</p>
      <p>These wines remain the only collaboration to date with an English producer by Aldi and the only English wines the retailer has included in their ‘Exquisite Collection’.</p>
      <p>The Lyme Block Sparkling Brut Reserve will be the first own label English Sparkling Wine to be recognised as part of their premium offer.</p>

      <p>Lyme Bay Winery and the team at Aldi have delivered a dry, clean and vibrant wine with crisp acidity, bursting with lemon, apple and freshly cut grass.</p>
      <p>It’s a fresh and fruity sparkler, making it the perfect drink for celebratory occasions whether matched with food or as an aperitif.</p>
      <p>Julie Ashfield, Managing Director of Buying at Aldi UK, said: “Given the success of our Exquisite Collection Lyme Block English Wine and Lyme Block Bacchus, we are thrilled to be working again with Lyme Bay Winery.</p>
      <p>“We are sure this elegant sparkling wine will be a hit with our customers this Christmas, especially as English Wines are gaining a reputation as some of the best in the world.”</p>
      <p>The sparkling wine is made from a blend of Pinot Noir, Seyval Blanc, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, Chardonnay and Reichensteiner, all from English vineyards. Only the finest press cuts are used and, after an extended cold settle, the wine is fermented at cool temperatures to maintain the freshness of the grapes.</p>
      <p>Sara Walters for Lyme Bay Winery commented: “We are thrilled to continue our collaboration with Aldi by extending the Lyme Block range. They are a retailer that has rightly earned a reputation for delivering excellent wines and to be part of that is a privilege for us.”</p>
      <p>James Lambert, managing director at Lyme Bay Winery added: “We are very proud of this wine, it really delivers, balancing citrus and toasty flavours with a consistent vibrancy.</p>
      <p>“It is an elegant and refined choice for anyone planning their festive celebrations.”</p>
      <p>The wine is available online from  <a href="http://www.aldi.co.uk/">www.aldi.co.uk</a>  from 9 December priced at £16.99.</p>
