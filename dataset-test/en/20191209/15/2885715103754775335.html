      <p>Amid skyrocketing price of onions, two bike-borne miscreants allegedly looted 50 kgs of bulb from a rickshaw puller in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur district, police said on Monday. The incident took place on Sunday afternoon when the rickshaw puller was going to deliver the onions to a hotel, they said. The onions had been bought from the shop of a Feroz Ahmad Raen, who has lodged a complaint in the matter, the police said.</p>
      <p>“A rickshaw puller, Yamuna, who delivers goods from my shop at Maheva Mandi and also from neighbouring shops, was carrying six sacks of onions to a hotel in Golghar area. As he reached the Alahdadpur trisection, a man came before his rickshaw. Meanwhile, two persons came on a motorcycle from behind and looted a sack of onion,” Raen said.</p>
      <p>One sack contains nearly 50 kgs of onions.</p>
      <p>“We found out that before the rickshaw puller started from the shop, Feroze had an altercation with another person over the price of onions. The shopkeeper has given a written complaint to the police post incharge but the FIR will be lodged only after investigation,” said Circle Officer, Kotwali, V P Singh.</p>
      <p>“Police is checking the CCTV footage and action will be taken on the basis of investigation,” Superintendent of Police (city) Kaustabh said.</p>
