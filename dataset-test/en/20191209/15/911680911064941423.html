      <h1>Miss South Africa crowned 2019 Miss Universe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:08:15+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:08</time> by <a rel="author">CNN Newsource</a></address>
      <p>Miss South Africa rules all.</p>
      <p>Zozibini Tunzi was crowned <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/entertainment/miss-universe-2019-how-to-watch-trnd/index.html">Miss Universe Sunday night </a>after excelling through rounds of swimsuit and evening gown struts, questions on social issues and one final chance to explain why she was the right choice.</p>
      <p>"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me — with my kind of skin and my kind of hair — was never considered to be beautiful," she said in her last response. "I think it is time that that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face and I want them to see their faces reflected in mine."</p>
      <p>The two runners-up for the crown were Miss Mexico and Miss Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>"If you do not use your beauty for your life's mission, it's just an empty ornament," Sofía Aragón, representing Mexico, said earlier in the competition.</p>
      <p>Madison Anderson represented Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>"Being on the Miss Universe stage is not just a dream" Anderson said. "I believe that I found my mission. It's a representation of dedication, resilience and perseverance. I do believe my mission is to show the world that magic happens when we refuse to give up because the universe always listens to a stubborn heart."</p>
      <p>And if you're wondering, yes, there was another mix-up and Steve Harvey was involved in it. But it was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/05/us/kentucky-derby-unexpected-results-trnd/">nothing like the 2015 disaster</a> when he called out the wrong winner.</p>
      <p>Harvey hosted the pageant for the fifth time sporting a bedazzled green and gold suit jacket.</p>
      <p>He was commenting on a costume from earlier in week and said Miss Philippines won the National Costume Contest. He was right, but the woman who came out on stage said she was Miss Malaysia.</p>
      <p>"Y'all got to quit doing this to me," he said.</p>
      <p>The massive competition was hosted at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>It has already made history with Miss Myanmar, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5zWI6dHEX6/">Swe Zin Htet</a> , who says she's the first openly gay contestant.</p>
      <p>Last year's winner, Catriona Gray from the Philippines spoke during Sunday's pageant, saying the past year has been "unforgettable, life-changing and purposeful."</p>
      <p>"We're getting this amazing platform to voice the things we're passionate about, the things we care about," she said in a video. "I always had a voice, but Miss Universe allowed me to amplify it."</p>
