      <p><b>Original article</b>: Eskom on Monday evening took the unprecedented step of implementing Stage 6 load shedding.</p>
      <p>In an announcement on Twitter, that almost immediately received widespread criticism from users, Eskom will aim to shed 6000MW of demand from the grid.</p>
      <p>The power utility blamed a “technical problem” at Medupi, its largest coal power plant, on the further escalation.</p>

      <p>“We regret and sincerely apologise that stage 4 load shedding will move to Stage 6 load shedding as from 6pm today, as a result of a shortage of capacity,” it said <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3264112613615460&amp;id=652838731409541">in an extended statement posted to Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>“The <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/12/flooding-gauteng-mpumalanga/">heavy rains</a> has caused coal handling and operational problems at several power stations.”</p>
      <p>“We remind and assure customers that load shedding at Stage 6 is no cause for alarm as the system is being effectively controlled. Stage 6, requires 6000MW to be rotationally loadshed,” it added.</p>
      <p>Stage 6 will begin at 6pm.</p>
      <p>The news comes just hours after Eskom <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/12/stage-2-load-shedding-monday/">reimplemented Stage 4 load shedding</a>. It noted that at the time, <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/12/eskom-unavailable-capacity-december/">14 200MW was rendered unavailable</a>.</p>
