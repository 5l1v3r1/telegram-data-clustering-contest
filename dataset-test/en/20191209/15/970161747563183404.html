      <p>A new mural thought to be by Banksy has appeared in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>The mural, which makes a park bench appear to be Santa’s sleigh being pulled along by reindeer, was painted in the Jewellery Quarter over the weekend.</p>
      <p>It draws attention to homelessness, with anyone sitting on the bench appearing to look like Father Christmas.</p>
      <p>A video on the artist’s Instagram page is captioned: ‘God bless Birmingham.’</p>
      <p>It shows a homeless man called Ryan having a drink before lying down on the bench as the camera pans out.</p>
      <p>The message continued: ‘In the 20 minutes we filmed Ryan on this bench passers-by gave him a hot drink, two chocolate bars and a lighter – without him ever asking for anything.’</p>
