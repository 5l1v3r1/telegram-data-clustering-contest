      <p><b>MEXICO CITY (AP)</b> - Mexico recalled its ambassador to Argentina after a video surfaced suggesting he may have tried to steal a book from a Buenos Aires bookstore.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Óscar Valero Recio Becerra "has been ordered to return home," said Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard. The diplomat will be investigated by a government ethics committee.</p>
      <p>If Recio Becerra is found to have stolen the book, Ebrard said he will be fired, noting there will "zero tolerance for dishonesty."</p>
      <p>The video appears to show the diplomat tucking the book into a stack of papers he is holding and being stopped by security after passing a detector gate on the way out.</p>
      <p>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Monday the incident was "regrettable," but warned against a rush to judgement.</p>
      <p>López Obrador noted that Recio Becerra was both a career diplomat and had a long pedigree in Mexico's left.</p>
      <p>The incident is especially embarrassing given López Obrador's main policy aim of promoting honesty among public servants.</p>
      <p>But his administration has also imposed harsh cuts on pay and expenses for some diplomats.</p>
