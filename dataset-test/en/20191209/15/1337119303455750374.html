      <p><i>Ghostbusters </i>is returning to the big screen once more — this time with a true sequel to the original films. The first trailer for <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> sets the stage for a small town haunting as a single mom and her two kids try to start a new life.</p>
      <p>While the family tries to settle down in their creepy old farmhouse, the town is plagued by strange earthquakes and unexplainable phenomena. <i>Stranger Things</i>-esque vibes aside, the trailer also teases a clear connection to the original <i>Ghostbusters</i> crew — particularly to the bespectacled Egon (played by the late Harold Ramis). The film’s original cast, including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson, are also expected to reprise their roles.</p>
      <p><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> stars Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Mckenna Grace, and Finn Wolfhard. It will arrive in theaters in July 2020.</p>
