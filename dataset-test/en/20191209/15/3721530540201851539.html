      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/3/20992612/modern-warfare-season-1-patch-new-maps-crash-battle-pass"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a> may be getting a battle royale mode, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/24/18014764/blackout-call-of-duty-black-ops-4-battle-royale">which is obviously not a first</a>. The first inklings of the mode <a href="https://charlieintel.com/data-miners-find-extensive-battle-royale-content-in-modern-warfare-files-including-map/58015/">leaked through data miners last month</a>, but now a strange new glitch (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/26/20983700/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-spawn-fall-death-bug">in a game that has a few of them</a>) appears to confirm everything those leaks suggested.</p>
      <p>In November, data miners posted information about a series of files that they found in the PC version of <i>Modern Warfare</i> that referenced something called “BR.” The files contained a description for a mode called “Battle Royale,” a player count of up to 200, and even a top down view of the map the mode supposedly takes place on.</p>
      <p>While there was no evidence for the mode outside of the files at the time of the leaks, a new bug seems to confirm suspicions. Late Sunday night, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/e8462g/video_of_full_battle_royale_map/">Nateberg3</a> posted a video of themselves being transported high above a strange new map after attempting to load into a Spec Ops match. From their vantage point, they’re able to look around at the entire map and see many of the same places that popped up in the leaked map from the battle royale mode.</p>
      <p>According to the earlier leak, this battle royale mode is being developed by Raven Software and will be released in early 2020 as a free to play, standalone mode. So far, there has been no official word from Activision on whether or not <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcall-of-duty%2F5120157&amp;subid1=polygon"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a> is actually getting a battle royale mode or not.</p>
