      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:44:28+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal winger Nicolas Pepe has revealed that interim manager Freddie Ljungberg has made alterations to the training and tactics at the club since taking over from Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg is in charge on a temporary basis following the sacking of Emery earlier this month, and will be looking for his first win when the Gunners take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Monday night.</p>
      <p>His spell has been disappointing so far, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> drawing with Norwich and losing to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> in his two games in the dugout, but Pepe believes the team need time to adjust to Ljungberg's way of thinking.</p>
      <p>"There have been some changes schedule-wise in terms of the training, Ljungberg has his own way of dictating training," Pepe said.</p>

      <p>"Obviously he has already shared his vision. There have been a few tactical changes, but it takes time for everything to settle."</p>
      <p>Pepe said he is drawing on his experiences at Lille to try to get through Arsenal's tough period, and knows that the club's supporters expect them to do a lot better.</p>
      <p>He added: "Obviously it is a frustrating situation for us, but it is nothing new (for me).</p>
      <p>"When I was at Lille we had a bit of the same, we went ten, eleven games without a win and obviously this adds to the pressure.</p>
      <p>"We know that our fans have a lot of expectations from us."</p>

      <p>Pepe is yet to justify the big transfer fee paid for him over the summer, and has so far scored just three goals in all competitions, with a solitary strike in the Premier League from the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>He has not been in the starting line-up for the last five games in the league, and will be hoping that changes for the game against the Hammers.</p>
