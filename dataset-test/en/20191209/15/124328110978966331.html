      <p>Bette Milder is facing a backlash on Twitter after sharing a picture of three teenage girls looking at their phones in an art gallery.</p>
      <p>The Hocus Pocus star, 74, shared an <a href="https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/1203660493459734528"><b>image</b></a> of three girls sitting on a bench in front of Jean-Baptiste Greuze' painting Aegina Visited by Jupiter at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York </p>
      <p>She wrote: 'What's wrong with this picture?,' seeming to suggest that it was shame the young women were on their phones, rather than engaging with the artworks. </p>
      <p>But she was quickly met with the wrath of furious Twitter users, who explained to her the museum has an interactive app to help guide visitors around. </p>
      <p>One user wrote: ‘I’ll tell you what’s wrong with the f****** picture, Bette Midler taking a photo for three random, seemingly underaged girls and then making fun of them on Twitter, almost definitely without permission from any of the girls pictured. That’s creepy, Bette.’ </p>

      </figure>
      <p>One wrote: 'Nothing. I see three young women at a museum, probably looking at the museum app on their phone to read more about the paintings. </p>
      <p>Another added: 'Nothing, Bette, absolutely nothing. I see three young people in a gallery, and if they want to use their phones and rest their museum legs by perching on a bench, then that's cool.'</p>
      <p>A third commented: 'In art galleries I struggle to stay standing due to my disability. So I take breaks, sit, look at my phone. Get my blood pressure back, and then continue to look at art and enjoy myself. F*** you, think before you speak.'</p>
      <p>Some used the opportunity to make fun of how the photo was taken: 'Composition isn't great, the grid on your phone can help you frame your subjects better' one wrote.</p>

      <p>Others used the tweet to discussing what they deemed as problems in the art industry: 'Museum collections are still heavily weighted toward European art of a certain era thanks to limited diversity at every level from curators to wealthy donors and board members?'     </p>
      <p>'The teens were on the museum's app, reading about the paintings,' one user wrote, adding that the issue was first debated a few years ago when the photo originally went viral.</p>
      <p>Piers Morgan also slammed the actress, adding: 'Is it that some smart-a** busy-body singer is publicly shaming three young people minding their own business in an art gallery?'  </p>

      <p>It's not the first time the Oscar-nominated actress has got into hot water over her controversial Twitter manner.</p>
      <p>In August 2016 she misgendered and deadnamed Caitlyn Jenner, after her docu-series I Am Cait was cancelled.   </p>
      <p>'Now that @IAmCait has been cancelled will she go back to being Bruce?' She wrote. 'Will Kris take him back? Do I smell a rewedding?' </p>
      <p>She was also accused of slut-shaming, after hitting out at Kim Kardashian for posting a risque pictured online.</p>
      <p>'Kim Kardashian tweeted a nude selfie today' Bette tweeted. 'If Kim wants us to see a part of her we've never seen, she's gonna have to swallow the camera'.</p>
