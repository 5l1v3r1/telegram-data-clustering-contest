      <h1>Apple May Be Revisiting the iPhone 9 Next Year With the SE 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:40:19+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>The iPhone SE 2 series has been rumoured for a while, but it looks like it may usurp the title of iPhone 9.</p>
      <p>Japanese blog <a href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-38948.html">Macotakara</a> claims to have an insider who confirms that the iPhone SE 2 will actually be dubbed the iPhone 9, which Apple previously skipped over - and will house the same A13 processor as the iPhone 11 series.</p>
      <p>Apple first launched its  midrange smartphone in 2016 but it was <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/09/rip-iphone-se/">discontinued last year</a>, leaving pricey handsets as the only option for its customers. Since October, we've hears rumours about the return of the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/actually-the-small-iphone-is-bad/">iPhone SE 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/12/iphone-se-2-plus-rumour/">iPhone SE 2 Plus</a>, positioned for a 2021 launch.</p>
      <p>Last week, analyst <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/273923/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> detailed his <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/12/iphone-se-2-plus-rumour/">predictions</a> for Apple's releases for 2020 and 2021, and coupled with this latest titbit, we're expecting to see the iPhone SE 2 (or iPhone 9) roll out next year with a price point as low as $399/ £300.</p>
      <p>Coupled with his other predictions, we're looking at a possible five devices being released into the market next year, with an additional two devices (including the iPhone SE 2 Plus) launching the following year.
