      <h1>Hero MotoCorp to hike prices by up to ₹2,000 from January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:53:01+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Two-wheeler market leader Hero MotoCorp on Monday said that it will increase prices of its motorcycles and scooters by up to ₹2,000 from January.</p>
      <p>The price hike will be across range of two-wheelers and the exact quantum of the hike will vary on the basis of model and specific market, Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It, however, did not specify reasons for the plan to hike prices.</p>
      <p>The company currently sells a range of motorcycles and scooters priced between ₹39,900 and ₹1.05 lakh. Last week, the country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India had announced that would hike prices of its vehicles from January to offset rising input costs.</p>
