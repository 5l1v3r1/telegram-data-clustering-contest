      <p>Human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), has said the Federal Government and the Department of State Services are not ready for the trial of his client, Omoyele Sowore.</p>
      <p>Sowore, alongside Olawale Bakare, is being charged by the DSS with treasonable felony and money laundering, among others.</p>
      <p>Falana spoke while featuring as a guest on TVC’s flagship programme, ‘Your View,’ on Monday.</p>
      <p>He said the Federal Government kept Sowore in detention because it was not prepared to try the convener of the #RevolutionNow movement.</p>
      <p>Falana alleged that the Federal Government wanted Sowore to sign “his [own] death warrant,” urging Nigerians not to believe the version of the government narrative on what transpired in the premises of the Federal High Court, Abuja last Friday.</p>
      <p>TVC on Twitter quoted Falana as saying, “In 2003, 2007, 2011, President Muhammad Buhari lost election to the Peoples Democratic Party and he led protests for a revolution.</p>
      <p>“The law that put the State Security Service together states that you’re supposed to act for the Nigerian people, not [for] those in power.</p>
      <p>“They wanted me to persuade Sowore to sign his death warrant and I refused.</p>
      <p>“The government isn’t ready for trial; that is why they elongate his detention.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about DSS’ denial of invading the High Court, Falana said, “I’m sure you know that they (the government) tell a lot of lies.</p>
      <p>“You do not arrest anybody in the presence of the court. The government tells a lot of lies.”</p>
      <p>On what transpired between DSS and Sowore, the lawyer said, “I saw a bunch of hired elements apparently sponsored by the government to protest the release of Sowore and Bakare.</p>
      <p>“As soon as our case was adjourned, we were about leaving the court before he (Sowore) was assaulted.”</p>
