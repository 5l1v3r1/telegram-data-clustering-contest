        <b>Sligo Rovers have continued building for the 2020 SSE Airtricity Premier Division campaign with the capture of American midfielder Will Seymore. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 28-year old has signed from USL side Reno 1868 (actually formed in 2015).</p>
      <p>Seymore has bounced around the American second tier in recent years with spells at Vancouver Whitecaps reserve side Whitecaps FC 2 and Cincinnatti where he was a teammate of former Rovers midfielder Richie Ryan.</p>
      <p>He's the sixteenth player to sign for the Bit-o-Red for next season, and is someone manager Liam Buckley has been admiring for a while with Ryan playing a part in Seymore's recruitment.</p>
      <p>Buckley is happy to finally get his man, "I think he is equipped to do very well in this league.</p>
      <p>"He fits exactly into how we want to play. His range of passing, and his overall ability in that area, is why we’ve brought him here.</p>
      <p>"He is also a big, strong lad and he has done well in the US. We’ve done our due diligence on him."</p>
      <p>Buckley says Ryan's scouting report on Seymore highlighted a player that "reads the game well and has all the attributes to do well for us".</p>
      <p>Seymore says Buckley's style of football sold him on a move to the Showgrounds, adding, "One of the things I hope to bring is my mentality.</p>
      <p>"Off the field, I’m pretty easy going but on the field, I’m aggressive, determined and want to win at all costs.</p>
      <p>"I can’t wait to build a connection with my team-mates and start the season on the right foot."</p>

      <p>Buckley says player-coach John Russell was also involved in bringing Seymore on board, and the club legend is set to continue his third spell at the club into 2020.</p>
      <p>The Sligo boss says Seymore and Russell's acquisitions complete his midfield preparations, but hasn't ruled out one more foray into the market, "I expect to sign one more player, I’m not going to put a timescale on that at the moment.</p>
      <p>"From there we will look at things. We’ve tried to plan ahead.</p>
      <p>"We believe the off-season programmes are working for the lads and when we start in January we’ll start as a finalised group or as close to it as possible.</p>
      <p>"That doesn’t guarantee you anything. It doesn’t guarantee us a brilliant season. But I do think it gives us a better chance.</p>
      <p>"We want to land running. We want to be better. This is another step towards that and we’re looking forward to 2020."</p>
