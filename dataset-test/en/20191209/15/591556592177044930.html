      <p>Nokia has temporarily halted legal proceedings against Daimler in a last-ditch attempt to reach a resolution before court action.  <br/><br/>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-antitrust-nokia-daimler/nokia-halts-legal-action-against-daimler-with-mediation-offer-idUSKBN1YD1EN">reported by Reuters</a>, on Monday, the Finnish telecoms giant is pursuing Daimler, a German multinational automaker, for licensing fees related to technology crucial for smart and modern car navigation, communications, and automation. </p>
      <p>The Nokia-Daimler lawsuits, in which both companies have filed complaints against each other, relate specifically to vehicle communication.  <br/><br/><b>See also: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nokia-q3-2019-earnings-prompt-share-plummet-5g-risks-materialize/">Nokia Q3 2019 earnings prompt share plummet, 5G risks 'materialize'</a> <br/><br/>Nokia has alleged that Daimler has used patents in its portfolio without negotiating licensing terms and payments, a common practice employed by patent holders to permit other businesses to use protected intellectual property and designs. </p>
      <p>Rather than fight multiple lawsuits in court, Nokia has proposed independent mediation, postponing a planned court hearing due to take place on December 10.  <br/><br/>A company spokesperson told the news agency, "We trust that Daimler and its tier 1 suppliers will now engage in these meaningful efforts to reach settlement," adding that, "there is more to gain for all if we work together."</p>

The European Commission (EC) has been poised to launch an investigation into Nokia's licensing practices on the basis of a <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/daimler-asks-eu-antitrust-regulators-probe-nokia-patents">previous complaint</a> submitted by Daimler.  <br/><br/>"Fair and non-discriminatory access to these standards for all users of the essential patents for telecommunications standards is a key prerequisite for the development of new products and services for connected driving," Daimler said.  <br/><br/>EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager approved the mediation efforts, saying that "mutual understanding" would be of benefit to the companies.  <br/><br/>In April, the EC published an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_2008">antitrust complaint</a> levied at Daimler, Daimler and VW (Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche) which accused the automakers of colluding to restrict the development of clean-air emissions technology. <br/><br/><b>CNET: </b><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nokia-9-pureview-5-rear-cameras-yawn-limited-edition/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b">Nokia 9 PureView has 5 rear cameras: *yawn*</a> <br/><br/>Nokia posted <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nokia-q3-2019-earnings-prompt-share-plummet-5g-risks-materialize/">Q3 2019 earnings</a> in October including revenues of €5.686 billion with diluted earnings per share of €0.01, or €0.05 non-IFRS. The company slashed its 2019 and 2020 outlooks and announced plans to pause dividend payments. Share prices plummeted by 24 percent at the time of the financial results' release. </p>
