      <p>Honeypreet Insan -- the adopted daughter of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh -- met the jailed godman at Rohtak's Sunaria prison on Monday.</p>
      <p>This was the first such meeting between them after the dera chief's conviction in a rape case over two years ago.</p>
      <p>Accompanied by a lawyer and a dera functionary, Honeypreet spent nearly 40 minutes with the dera chief, officials said.</p>
      <p>Honeypreet was granted bail a month ago in connection with the Panchkula violence that had left scores dead immediately after the dera head's conviction.</p>
      <p>Honeypreet (38), whose real name is Priyanka Taneja, had accompanied Ram Rahim from the dera headquarters in Sirsa to a special CBI court in Panchkula on August 25, 2017, when the verdict in the case was pronounced. After the dera chief's conviction, she had accompanied him in a chopper to the Rohtak jail.</p>
      <p>She was arrested on October 3, 2017, by the Haryana Police from the Zirakpur-Patiala road.</p>
      <p>Over a month ago, a court in Panchkula had dropped sedition charges against Honeypreet in connection with the violence.</p>
      <p>She, along with others, was named in the FIR for conspiring to incite violence in Panchkula.</p>
