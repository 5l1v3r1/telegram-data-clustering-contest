      <h1>‘Laugh at what is hurting you’: Lebanon cartoonists stir debate</h1>

      <p>On the edges of a protest in Lebanon’s capital, 24-year-old cartoonist Mohamad Nohad Alameddine bites through sticky tape and plasters one of his political sketches to a side wall.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t been able to work with newspapers, so instead I come down and stick them up in the street,” says the unemployed artist, who graduated this year with a master’s degree in press cartoons.</p>
      <p>Until this autumn, Alameddine had been poking fun at his country’s political and economic ills in sketches he posted online.</p>
      <p>But from October 17, anti-government protests swept across the country, giving him a broader audience as protesters denounced the very same issues he had been drawing all along.</p>
      <p>In public spaces, he and friends stuck up gags about failing electricity and rubbish management plans, as well as sketches mocking a political class perceived as corrupt.</p>
      <p>In one cartoon, a skinny man stripped down to his underpants stands in front of a leader carried in on a gilded throne.</p>
      <p>“We want your underwear to pay back the debt,” says the moustachioed politician, clutching a lit cigar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Inspiration everywhere</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now in the grips of a dollar liquidity crunch, Lebanon is staggering under a public debt of $86 billion.</p>
      <p>Wherever there was a protest, “I’d go down and stick up a related cartoon”, says Alameddine, who signs his drawings as Nougature.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people encouraged me.”</p>
      <p>In late October, the government stepped down, but a deeply divided political class has yet to form a new one.</p>
      <p>Last month, Alameddine drew his same long-nosed politician clutching the leg of his throne.</p>
      <p>“Don’t worry my love, I’d never leave you,” says the character he has called President Nazeeh, dressed in a rabbit-themed pyjama onesie.</p>
      <p>Alameddine says the fictional leader is his way of criticising the traditional ruling class without naming names.</p>
      <p>“President Nazeeh headed a militia in the civil war and then became a political figure” after the 1975-1990 conflict, he says.</p>
      <p>“We see how he deals with people, what he does under the table, what he says in public, how he manages corruption rings – but in a funny way,” he says.</p>
      <p>“In the end you want to laugh at what’s hurting you.”</p>
      <p>On the other side of Beirut, 31-year-old Bernard Hage pens away at his digital drawing board, trying out his latest idea for a cartoon.</p>
      <p>He says he gladly swapped a career in advertising for the arts several years ago, including drawing a stream of jokes under the name The Art of Boo.</p>
      <p>In May, months before the anti-graft street movement, he drew a group of men in suits sitting in the lotus position in yoga class.</p>
      <p>“Very good. Now exhale, keep ignoring the crisis,” their leotard-clad instructor says.</p>
      <p>Hage says inspiration is everywhere in Lebanon, “whether you’re in a taxi, at the vegetable shop or at the barber.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emigrate?</b>
      </p>
      <p>But the recent outburst of popular anger has amplified debate.</p>
      <p>“I found my place in the revolution,” says the satirical artist, who regularly posts on social media and draws once a week for a local newspaper.</p>
      <p>“My role is to keep the conversation going, shed light on issues.”</p>
      <p>To celebrate one month since the protests began, he drew a vision for the country 10 years from now, featuring “things we’d like to hear in the near future”.</p>
      <p>On a page spread in French-language newspaper L’Orient-Le Jour, he imagined a world with smooth public transport and no daily electricity cuts.</p>
      <p>“Daddy, what’s a dijoncteur?” one girl asks, using the French word for the circuit breaker that trips before power outages.</p>
      <p>A stick figure clings to a pole in a subway, as a voice overhead calls out the next stop in central Beirut.</p>
      <p>“Change here for line 1&amp;4. Mind the gap,” it says.</p>
      <p>To avoid offending anyone, Hage says he rarely names political leaders, and depicts them all across the board as besuited figures with little bellies poking out.</p>
      <p>“I discovered there’s a big gap between my generation and my parents’ generation,” he says.</p>
      <p>“They lived through the war, saw death and were terrified by it – and it’s not easy for them to leave that behind,” or call out their traditional leaders, he says.</p>
      <p>But he says it is time to put the younger generation in charge to fix the country’s mounting woes – a polluted environment, a crashing economy, and high youth unemployment.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the cartoonist – also a musician and occasional writer – says he will follow his peers and emigrate.</p>
      <p>“I’m learning German because if this doesn’t work out, I will leave and not come back.”</p>
