        <b>Tragedy befell Buyagako Football Club based in Nakawa division, Kampala, of after four of its players drowned in River Nile at Kyekidde village, Buwenda parish, Mafubira sub-county in Jinja district on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The team was set to play a friendly match against Jinja-based Kakira Football Club before the players met their death.</p>
      <p>Police named the deceased as Ronald Tumwesigye, 22, James Ssenkumba, 28, and John Ssempebwa, 22, all residents of Mbuya ward, Kaggo zone in Nakawa division as well as Earnest Kafeero, 21.</p>
      <p>Diana Nandawula, the Kiira region Police spokesperson, said the deceased ignored warnings not to swim at a dangerous spot and they were immediately swept away by the strong currents.</p>
      <p>One of the Buyagako players said they had been warned of the spot from where they wanted to swim but their colleagues did not heed to the advice of locals.</p>
      <p>Nandawula said the match that was slated for 3:00 PM at Buwenda playground in Mafubira sub-county, Jinja district was promptly cancelled.</p>

      <p>Hawali Kamya, the LC1 chairperson for Buwenda Central village said many visitors to the spot are fond of ignoring residents who try to alert them about the dangers of swimming there.</p>
      <p>“People think that since they come from Kampala they understand the geography of our area more than the locals. This shows a lack of respect even after being warned,” Kamya said, adding that this was the worst tragedy experienced in the area.</p>
      <p>Kamya said people have an impression that the waters at the spot are not deep yet the place is also slippery.</p>
      <p>Nandawula said it is important for people to read the notices that are placed at the river for better guidance.</p>
      <p>“There are notices barring people from entering the water at some points. These must be respected along with what residents tell them,” she urged.</p>
      <p>Police together with fishermen worked tirelessly to retrieve all the bodies of the players before they were taken to the Jinja Regional Referral Hospital mortuary to undergo a postmortem.</p>
