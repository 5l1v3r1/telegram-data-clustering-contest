      <h1>Mark Timlin re-signs with Finn Harps for 2020 League of Ireland season</h1>
      <h2>The Buncrana man has been with the Donegal outfit since initially joining in the summer of 2017 on loan from Derry City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:38:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Mark Timlin is the latest experienced campaigner to re-sign with Finn Harps.</p>
      <p>The Buncrana man has been with the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/donegal">Donegal</a> outfit since initially joining in the summer of 2017 on loan from north-west rivals Derry City.</p>
      <p>But the 2019 Premier Division campaign was a disrupted one for Timlin due to injuries and he said: “Last season was a tough year for me personally having to sit the majority of the season out injured, but overall I was delighted to be able to contribute towards the end and help the club stay in the Premier Division. </p>
      <p>"Fingers crossed I can stay injury free this year and help the club push on.”</p>
      <p>Harps boss Ollie Horgan remarked: “Mark had an awful time with injuries last season but in fairness to him he worked at it and did all he could to get back on the pitch and help the lads. </p>
      <p>"He’s probably one of our more creative players so with a bit of luck he can keep fit and give us a big boost going forward."</p>
