      <h1>‘Terminator’-Inspired NES Game “Journey to Silius” Being Added to Switch Online!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:34:23+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>After a few months hiatus, Switch Online is being updated this Thursday, December 12th with six classic Nintendo and Super NES games.</p>
      <p>However, the highlight is <b><i>Journey to Silius</i></b>, in which you play Jay, who is on a run and gun mission to take down the mechanical army responsible for his father’s death. In the game, you defeat endless waves of attack robots and fulfill his father’s dream of developing a space colony in the Silius Solar System.</p>
      <p>I thought the graphics and play style looked reminiscent of one of my all-time favorite games, <i>Blaster Master</i>, and a quick check to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_Silius">Wiki</a> confirmed both games were developed by Sunsoft. However, the biggest surprise wasn’t the <i>Blaster Master</i> connection, but that it was originally conceived and developed as an official <b><i>The Terminator</i> </b>video game until licensing rights to the film were lost during development.</p>
      <p>According to Wiki, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, although you can definitely see inspiration poking through. For those with Switch Online, this Thursday you can experience it for yourself. Watch the announcement trailer below.</p>
