      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> veteran kicker <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1097/adam-vinatieri">Adam Vinatieri</a> will undergo season-ending knee surgery and will be placed on injured reserve, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.</p>
      <p>The move signals the end of Vinatieri's 24th season in the NFL -- and potentially his career.</p>
      <p>Vinatieri, 46, was inactive for Sunday's loss to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> and has struggled throughout the season, making just 17-of-25 field goal attempts and 22-of-28 extra points.</p>
      <p>The Colts added insurance at the kicking position last Wednesday when they claimed <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3150744/chase-mclaughlin">Chase McLaughlin</a>, who made 2-of-3 field goals and all three of his PAT's on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Vinatieri routinely said his knee wasn't a problem, but something caused him to go from being one of the most reliable kickers in league history to being one of the weakest links on the Colts roster this season.</p>
      <p>The Colts, despite working out 11 kickers at two different times this season, stuck with Vinatieri even though he made a career-low 68 percent of his field goal attempts this season. Two of Vinatieri's misses -- at the Chargers and Pittsburgh -- cost the Colts games.</p>
      <p>If this season is Vinatieri's last, he'll finish his career as the NFL's all-time leading scorer with 2,671 points and 29-game winning kicks. Three of Vinatieri's most memorable game-winning kicks occurred when he was with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> from 1996-2005. He made a game winner in blizzard-like conditions against Oakland in the 2001 playoffs and winning kicks in Super Bowls XXXVI and XXXVII.</p>
