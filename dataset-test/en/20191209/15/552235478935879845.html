      <p>Flooding closed the A82 in Dumbarton on Sunday – with one driver describing the congestion caused as “absolute chaos”.</p>
      <p>The dual carriageway was closed in both directions at Dumbuck junction and closed to northbound traffic between Lomondgate Roundabout and Stoneymollan Roundabout for around three hours.</p>
      <p>There was heavy rain across the area over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Traffic Scotland tweeted about the disruption on Sunday morning, announcing the closure just after 10am. The A82 reopened at Dumbuck junction at 11.50am with the whole route clear by 1pm.</p>
      <p>One motorist told the Lennox Herald: “There was absolute chaos with a major blockage on the A82 Sunday morning lunchtime.</p>
      <p>“Not sure exactly where the blockage was but traffic at absolute standstill back from Milton to Garshake and Lomondgate.</p>
      <p>“I had to cancel trying to get to Clydebank.</p>
      <p>“This is now happening with grim regularity. The road is over capacity and long overdue for upgrade and the installation of a relief road.”</p>
