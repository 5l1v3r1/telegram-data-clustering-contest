      <h1>Jennifer Lopez Brought Her Versace Jungle Dress Back *Again* For Her SNL Monologue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:10:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Karenna Meredith</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Jennifer-Lopez">Jennifer Lopez</a> fully celebrated her unbelievable 2019 <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/chad-jlo-snl-skit-video-46990458">during <b>Saturday Night Live</b></a> on Dec. 7, and of course, she couldn't forget to mention <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Jennifer-Lopez-YouTube-Video-About-Her-Grammys-Versace-Dress-46055010">her iconic Versace jungle-print dress</a>, which <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/jennifer-lopez-wears-green-versace-dress-milan-fashion-week-46653423">she resurrected earlier this year</a>. While delivering her funny monologue, the 50-year-old pop star and actress cracked jokes about the fashion moment that shook the internet.</p>
      <p>"I walked the runway in Milan for the first time wearing a dress I wore 20 years ago. Some people said I look better now than I did then!" she said. "I'm not bragging! That's just, you know, gossip." To top it all off, she made a quick change into the <i>actual</i> gown while singing "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" with the Rockettes. See? This is exactly why J Lo can't be beat!</p>
      <p>Jennifer's homage to her green gown is a throwback in more ways than one. She actually wore the statement outfit when she hosted <b>SNL</b> for the first time, back in 2001. Donatella Versace herself kindly reminded fans of this moment when she posted a video on Instagram on Saturday night. Check it out below, then make sure to watch J Lo's full monologue above!</p>
