      <h1>Reports: Premier League clubs on high alert as Real Madrid targets €200million-worth player sales</h1>

        <b>As per the latest reports, Real Madrid need to complete player sales worth €200million before the end of the ongoing 2019-20 season, in order to balance their books as per FIFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1214892/Real-Madrid-transfer-news-Gareth-Bale-James-Rodriguez-Tottenham-Man-Utd-Arsenal"><i>Express</i></a> that claims that the Spanish news agency <i><a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/12/07/5de9a48346163fb1958b45a6.html/?tag=exp098-20">Marca</a></i> have reported that Real Madrid have spent too much money to sign new players, especially over the last few seasons in their bid to overthrow arch-rivals Barcelona from the top of the La Liga table.</p>
      <p>For instance, <i>Los Blancos</i> spent €298million in the 2019 summer transfer window alone – as they signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for €100million, Luka Jovic from Eintracht Frankfurt for €60million, Eder Militao from FC Porto for €50million, Ferland Mendy from Olympique Lyonnais for €48million and Rodrygo Goes from Santos for €40million. However, they were unable to make money back through the sales of Mateo Kovacic and Keylor Navas among others.</p>
      <p>As a result, Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane is fine with the club attempting to sell James Rodriguez, Gareth Bale, Mariano Diaz and Brahim Diaz during the upcoming January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United have been linked with Bale, while Arsenal and the United are said to be keen on signing Rodriguez.</p>
      <p>Isco has been targeted by Manchester City but Zidane is likely to keep him for the remainder of the season before offloading him in the summer.</p>
