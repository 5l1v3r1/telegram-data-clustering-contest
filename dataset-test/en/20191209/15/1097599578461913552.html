      <p>The former garda station in New Inn sold at public auction for €113,000.</p>
      <p>It is the fourth former garda station sold by Tipperary town auctioneer, Noel Corcorcan, following previous successful sales in Doon, Dundrum and Ballinure.</p>
      <p>There was enormous interest shown in the property by prospective purchasers and the autioneers  received about 40 enquiries with the vast majority of these  viewing the property.</p>
      <p>When the property was offered for sale by public auction at Cahir House Hotel   there was a good turnout of people..</p>
      <p>Bidding commenced at €50,000 and after a little pause steadily rose in €5000 increments with five parties bidding until it hit €100,000 at which stage, without even leaving the rostrum, the auctioneer declared the property on the market and he  took €1000 bids after that until such time as the hammer fell at €113,000.</p>
      <p>The purchasers are Tipperary based but it is unknown  yet what plans they have in mind for the property.</p>
