      <p>Japanese developer Beep has announced that its old-school shmup <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../classic-anime-shmup-cotton-is-getting-remade-for-ps4-pc-and-nintendo-switch-554151.phtml">Cotton! Reboot</a></i> has slipped from its spring 2020 release window, and is now expected to launch in the summer.<br/><br/><i>Cotton Reboot</i> was originally announced back in May, and is a modern-day remake of the classic Sharp X68000 release<i> Cotton</i>, (which itself is a port of 1991 arcade <i>Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams). Cotton Reboot</i> will feature overhauled audio/visuals and new game modes, but will also include the original X68000 version for old school fans.<br/><br/>The ultra-cute shmup is the story of a clumsy, candy-loving witch-in-training, who is asked by a space fairy to help save her planet from "The Evils". With the promise of "special" candy as a reward, Cotton and her new companion take to the skies on their mystical quest, battling through seven stages of classic arcade action.</p>

      <p><i>Cotton Reboot</i> is now expected to launch summer 2020 for PS4, PC and Nintendo Switch. There were also plans initially to press a new run of floppy discs for the X68000, but there has been no word on whether Beep still intend to go ahead with this niche idea.<br/><br/><a href="https://japanesenintendo.com/2019/12/07/cotton-reboot-moved-to-summer/#more-93290">Cotton Reboot moved to summer</a> [Japanese Nintendo]</p>
