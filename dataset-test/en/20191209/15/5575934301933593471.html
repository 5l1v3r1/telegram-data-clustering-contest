      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/cristiano-ronaldo?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is the 25th best player in world football right now, <a href="https://football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2019/wp277/en/">according to a computer algorithm.</a></p>
      <p>The programme, designed by InStat, ranks players across each of Europe’s top 35 leagues each week and takes into account the “player’s contribution to the team’s success, the significance of their actions, opponent’s level and the level of the championship they play in,” <a href="https://instatsport.com/football/instat_index">according to its website.</a></p>
      <p>Lionel Messi is ranked as the world’s number one player with a score of 401, while Ajax’s Hakim Ziyech, who’s scored 9 goals and made 15 assists for the Dutch champions already this term, comes in at second with 377.</p>
      <p>Paris Saint Germain’s Kylian Mbappe is third, trailing Ziyech by 11 points.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has a score of just 332, which is level on points with four other players – Leicester City’s Ben Chilwell, AZ Alkmaar striker Ousamma Idrissi, Atalanta’s Duvan Zapata, and finally Inter Milan midfielder Stefano Sensi.</p>
      <p>It also makes him the fifth most effective player in Serie A, a category which is topped by Lazio’s Ciro Immobile.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has had a disappointing season thus far by his standards. He has scored just eight times for Juventus, his worst return in over a decade at this point in the season.</p>
      <p>He also missed out on beating Lionel Messi to a sixth Ballon d’Or, with the Argentine dominating the voting at last week’s award ceremony to scoop the prize.</p>
