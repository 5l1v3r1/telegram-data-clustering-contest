      <h1>Niko Kovac's entourage rubbish rumours he wants to become Arsenal manager</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:42:50+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">Metro Sport Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Niko Kovac’s entourage have played down rumours that the Croatian has held talks to become <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> manager.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have sounded out a number of candidates to replace interim head coach Freddie Ljungberg following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a>’s sacking and Kovac emerged as a potential option over the weekend.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/kovac-arsenal-job-gunners-emery-replacement/141bcxc5ifqn411md0d486e8ln"><i>Goal</i></a>, Kovac’s representatives approached Arsenal to make their interest known and the 48-year-old was expected to attend the Gunners’ clash with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Kovac, who left Bayern Munich by mutual consent back in November, has also been linked with Everton after being spotted at Goodison Park.</p>

      <p>However, a member of Kovac’s entourage has rubbished the recent speculation and insists the ex-Croatia manager is still on a break from football.</p>
      <p>‘This is absolute nonsense,’ the unnamed source told the <i>German Press Agency.</i></p>
      <p>‘Niko has no interest at the moment, but wants to get away.’</p>
      <p>It’s understood Kovac has cancelled his planned trip to the London Stadium this evening.</p>
      <p>Former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has refused to rule out a move to Arsenal when asked about the vacant position at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>‘It’s important to have a moment of calm to lower the decibels and find the energy to take on a new project, and we’ll see where that is,’ the Argentine told <i>TyC Sports</i>.</p>
      <p>‘I’m going to spend a few days here [in Rosario] with my family and friends, and then I’ll return to London.’</p>

      <p>Brendan Rodgers was rumoured to be on Arsenal’s shortlist but the Northern Irishman signed a new deal with Leicester last week.</p>
      <p>On his decision to commit to Leicester, Rodgers explained: ‘When I made the decision to come to Leicester City, it was because I was excited about the direction the club was taking and how I could apply my experience to the journey.</p>
      <p>‘I came here with a purpose to add something to that and to help the club build for the future.</p>
      <p>‘The support I have had from the chairman, Khun Top; from the chief executive, Susan Whelan; from the director of football, Jon Rudkin; and from everyone at the club has been amazing.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve inherited an outstanding team of staff that are dedicated to progress and improvement and we have a group of players that are a joy to work with every day.</p>
      <p>‘And to the club’s supporters, I can only say thank you for welcoming me and my staff into your club and for putting your faith in our work.</p>
      <p>‘We’ll continue to work together to bring success to Leicester city for many years to come.’</p>
