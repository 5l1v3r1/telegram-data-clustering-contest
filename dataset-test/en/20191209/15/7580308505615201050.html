      <p>Borussia Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel will miss the rest of the year after needing surgery for a facial injury sustained in an accident at home, his club said Monday.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t talk to him yesterday (Sunday) because he was in intensive care in hospital,” said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre, while a club spokesman said Witsel fell at home but gave no further details.</p>
      <p>“He won’t be able to play for the rest of the year, but he is already at home,” added Favre.</p>
      <p>“It’s a shame for him and us, he’s an important player. Hopefully, he is back as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Witsel will miss Dortmund’s final Champions League group game at home to Sparta Prague on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They must better Inter Milan’s result against Barcelona at the San Siro in order to reach the last 16.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international will also be sidelined for the next three league games. Dortmund is third in the table, five points behind Bundesliga leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach.</p>
      <p>Witsel played in Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Fortuna Duesseldorf and has featured in all five Champions League group games this campaign.</p>
