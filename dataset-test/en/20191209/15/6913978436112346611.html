      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>AL-KHOBAR – </b>Emir of the Eastern Province Prince Saud Bin Naif on Tuesday launched the ‘ZADK’ Saudi Culinary Academy at its headquarters here, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said.<br/><br/>In his speech after cutting the ribbon formally inaugurating the academy, Prince Saud said: “The Saudi youth have become an example to be followed in their creativity in many fields. The Saudi citizen is capable of transferring the Kingdom’s culture to the world with professionalism and competence. There are vast opportunities before the Saudi youth with the food sector witnessing considerable development. Investment in this field is promising, provided high quality standards are followed in all aspects."<br/><br/>He further said: “I am impressed by the academy’s keenness to boost the principles of making optimum benefit from the local product, promoting Saudi cuisine worldwide and highlighting the richness of Saudi culture, which are part of the goals of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 that has opened wide opportunities for the youth, making them proud of their nation’s material and moral capabilities. I wish the academy and its personnel further success.”<br/><br/>Prince Saud patronized the signing of a number of agreements to support and sponsor scholarships for training in the academy, in addition to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for partnership with the Swiss Hospitality Academy.<br/><br/>On her own behalf and on behalf of the members of the Board of Directors, Rania Moualla, founder and chairperson of ‘ZADK’ academy, expressed thanks and appreciation to the emir for his support.<br/><br/>She added that Prince Saud’s inauguration of the academy confirms his support for Saudi young men and women and projects that contribute to developing their capabilities and skills, in addition to kindling their interest and enthusiasm to join fields that will develop these qualities.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, member of the Board of Directors Nouf Bint Abdulaziz Al-Turki said: “The academy endeavors to train Saudi chefs, who will transfer Saudi cuisine, which is rich in its variety and nutritional value, to the world and compete with world cuisines, with the help of training programs being provided by the academy.”<br/><br/>Al-Turki further said: “The Kingdom has a wealth of talents in culinary arts that are capable of competing and innovating, apart from the rich Saudi cuisine. ‘ZADK’ academy will support and develop these talents via various programs and scholarships it plans to grant to promising candidates.”<br/><br/>‘ZADK’ academy is a nonprofit project that will endeavor to train a number of Saudi young men and women, whose goal is to become professional chefs.<br/><br/>The academy is keen and ambitious to expand to different regions of the Kingdom, via an expansion and financial sustainability plan during the forthcoming years.</p>
