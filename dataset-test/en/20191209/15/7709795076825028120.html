        <b>Sporting Life's Tom Carnduff and George Pitts are joined by Sky Bet's Dale Tempest to review all the latest Premier League events.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Duncan Ferguson had an immediate impact at Everton as they beat Chelsea 3-1 at Goodison Park. Should he get the job on a full-time basis? Or is it important that they don't get carried away in the moment?</p>
      <p>It's been a great week for Manchester United after they secured bragging rights in the derby. We hear from former United defender Paul Parker who gives us his thoughts on the current situation.</p>
      <p>Leicester keep on winning. Are they serious title contenders? Or would you back Liverpool going the entire season unbeaten?</p>
      <p>We discuss all that and much more.</p>
