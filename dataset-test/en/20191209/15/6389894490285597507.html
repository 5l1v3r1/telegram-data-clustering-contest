      <p>Senior, an engineering supplier to the likes of Boeing and Daimler, has admitted it is thinking about selling off its aerostructures division, in a deal that could be worth up to £450m.</p>
      <p>Shares in the FTSE 250 company rose 5.5 per cent today after it confirmed reports that emerged over the weekend that a sale was under consideration, as one of several options amid a review of the business.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Senior posted a 16 per cent drop in first-half profit in August, as margins in the aerospace business were hit by Boeing’s decision to temporarily halt production of its best-selling 737 Max planes after two fatal crashes that involved the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Directors have not made a final decision, and the division may yet remain part of the business. However, it has appointed adviser Lazard on the potential sale, according to Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>The aerostructures business makes aeroplane parts as part of the company’s wider aerospace division, which makes up nearly three quarters of revenue. </p>
      <p>Last month, Senior said it was gearing up to restructure the business, in a process which wil include closing plants and cutting jobs.</p>
      <p>“It is Senior’s policy to review its portfolio on an ongoing basis and evaluate all its operating businesses in terms of their strategic fit within the Group,” it said. </p>
      <p>“Senior can confirm that it has been reviewing all strategic options for its aerostructures business, which includes an early stage assessment of a potential divestment of the division. </p>
