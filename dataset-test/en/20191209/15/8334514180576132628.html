      <p>(Reuters) - The world’s elite athletes may think twice before employing Reuban Kipyego as a marathon pacemaker again, after the Kenyan had a late change of heart in a recent race and kicked on for a bizarre victory.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old had been due to drop out of last Friday’s Abu Dhabi Marathon after 30km, but clearly his competitive spirit — and the lure of a $100,000 prize — got the better of him.</p>
      <p>“For me, the conditions were ideal and the course was beautiful,” Kipyego smiled after the unconventional win.</p>
      <p>“I’m already looking forward to returning to Abu Dhabi to defend my title,” he added, cheekily.</p>
      <p>Pacemakers generally drop out before the finish line but are allowed to finish the race if they choose to do so.</p>
      <p>Kipyego, who had been wearing a numberless bib with the words “Pace M2” denoting his role, finished with a negative split, running the second half of the race faster than the first, to win in 2:04.40 — the fastest time of his life.</p>
      <p>While unusual, Kipyego’s feat is not a first. American pacemaker Paul Pilkington won the Los Angeles Marathon in 1994, while Kenya’s Simon Biwott accomplished the same feat at the Berlin Marathon in 2000.</p>
