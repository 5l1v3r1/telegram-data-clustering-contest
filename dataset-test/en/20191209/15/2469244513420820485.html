      <p>The Blue Cross rehoming centre in Torbay is looking for a new home for five kittens who have been abandoned just before Christmas.</p>
      <p>The litter of five kittens - Gingerbread, Candy Cane, Frosty, Tiny Tim and Cinnamon - were rejected by their mother at birth.</p>
      <p>Now two weeks old, they were brought in by their previous owner as she could not offer the kittens the level of care they needed.</p>
      <p>They are being cared for by some of the staff at the rehoming centre on Ashley Prior’s Lane, as they do not have any foster homes suitable for the round-the-clock care the kittens need.</p>
      <p>The tiny kittens need to be bottle fed every two hours, including through the night, so even though they’re adorable, it is a challenging time.</p>

      <p>Since August, Torbay’s rehoming centre has taken in 38 kittens from the ages of two weeks to seven months old; their latest kitten season yet.</p>
      <p>The group will be going up for rehoming at around eight weeks of age, so homes will be needed for the new year.</p>
      <p>Foster homes are a lifeline for pets who need to be hand-reared and pets who struggle in kennels and catteries.</p>
      <p>In what is already a crucial or stressful time in a pet’s life, being in kennels and catteries can have a detrimental effect on their happiness and lead to deterioration in health and behaviour.</p>
      <p>The centre is also in need of other foster carers for cats, kittens and small animals.   </p>
      <p>Jo Dempsey, animal welfare assistant at Blue Cross Torbay, said: “With Christmas coming up, we’d really love to be able to give loving moments to all the pets in our care, particularly for the hand-rears who are so dependent on us for survival.</p>

      <p>"We’ve seen a record number of unwanted litters this autumn, many accidental, so please do think about neutering cats to avoid having so many in shelters.”</p>
      <p>The centre is looking for a hand-rear foster carer who does not work and has the time to potentially feed kittens every two hours.</p>
      <p>It will be a position that would likely have the kittens for up to seven weeks. Experienced hand-rear fosterers are desirable but full training will be given and staff are always on hand in case of any emergencies.</p>
      <p>Jo said: “Thanks so much to all the volunteers we do have who help give special moments to pets who might not be able to cope otherwise.”</p>
      <p>If you are not able to foster but want to help pets in need, you could call the centre to find out what items you could donate.  </p>
