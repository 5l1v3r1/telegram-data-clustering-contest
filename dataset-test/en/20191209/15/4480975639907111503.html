      <h1>Fitch: Smoother Italy-EU relations do not remove fiscal uncertainty</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:04:27+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>Political divisions and differing policy views within Italy's governing coalition are likely to constrain meaningful tax &amp; structural reforms, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Monday and further noted that the smoother relations with the European Union (EU) wouldn't eliminate the fiscal uncertainty, per Reuters.</p>
      <p>"There is a high risk that Italy's PD-M5S-led government will not serve the full term, with near-term potential flashpoints," the report further read.</p>
      <p>The EUR/USD pair's reaction to these remarks was muted and it was last seen trading at 1.1075, adding 0.15% on the day.</p>
