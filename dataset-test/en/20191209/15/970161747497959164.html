      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kirk-douglas/">Kirk Douglas</a> is racking up quite the innings.</p>
      <p>The actor turned 103 yesterday (8 December), and among those to publicly pay tribute to the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Spartacus star was his daughter-in-law, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/catherine-zeta-jones/">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>.</p>
      <p>Zeta-Jones, who is married to Kirk’s son <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-douglas/">Michael Douglas</a>, posted a recent picture of herself with Kirk on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B52P6e6H5UE/?utm_source=ig_embed">Instagram</a> with the caption: ‘This guy on my knee, is 103!</p>
      <p>‘Happy Birthday Pappy!!! I love you with all my heart.’</p>

      <p>You can only hope that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/michael-douglas-father-kirk-begging-crying-not-party-103rd-birthday-11197804/">Michael didn’t go against Kirk’s wishes this year by staging a birthday party</a> to celebrate his father’s latest milestone.</p>
      <p>After revealing that Kirk was growing tired of big birthday parties following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/12/02/kirk-douglas-pens-sweet-letter-about-his-wife-as-he-celebrates-his-100th-birthday-6297949/">the grand bash they held for his 100th</a> in 2016, Michael joked to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jimmy-kimmel/">Jimmy Kimmel</a> last month: ‘So now [Kirk’s] begging me [not to throw a party], he’s got tears down his eyes.</p>
      <p>‘”Let’s just have dinner, the family together. Bring the kids.”‘</p>
      <p>The man’s 103, Michael: give him this one. After all, he doesn’t ask for much.</p>

      <p>Kirk has, in fact, made it a tradition in recent years to donate to charitable causes on his birthday.</p>
      <p>‘Anne [Buydens, his wife] and I always use these happy occasions to give presents to the institutions we support through our foundation,’ he explained in 2016.</p>
      <p>‘Giving is a selfish act, I maintain, because it makes you feel so good.’</p>
      <p>What a gem. Happy Birthday, Kirk!</p>
