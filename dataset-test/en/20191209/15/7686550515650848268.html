      <p>Neil Harris has highlighted the full-back areas as a key department in which he wants to improve Cardiff City's squad in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>While Harris has repeatedly said he would like to streamline his already bloated <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Bluebirds</a> squad next month, he believes he is somewhat light at full-back.</p>
      <p>Lee Peltier and Joe Bennett have been the mainstays at right and left-back respectively this season, with little to no back-up should either one of them fall foul of injury over this congested winter period.</p>
      <p>At right-back, Cameron Coxe has largely been Peltier's understudy this season, however Jazz Richards made a welcome return to the bench against Barnsley last weekend.</p>
      <p>On the other flank, however, Bennett faces no competition for his spot. While Harris has spoken highly of 18-year-old prospect Joel Bagan, who has impressed for the under-23s and has been training with the first team, he believes it might be too big of a step up to Championship football for him at present.</p>
      <p>And with Greg Cunningham both injured and on loan at Blackburn Rovers, Harris believes it is an area in which he might have to invest next month.</p>
      <p>"I think we have to look at the full-back areas," Harris said of his January transfer plans. "Obviously Jazz came back into the squad in the weekend.</p>
      <p>"I have spoken highly of Jazz. My teams in the past have played against Jazz as a right-back and a left-back, so I have seen him in both positions.</p>
      <p>"When you have someone who can cover both positions that really is ideal. However we have to be mindful of Jazzâ€™s injury record in the last two seasons and Jazz has to prove himself day in, day out he can train and play at a continuous standard to be considered regularly for a starting position.</p>
      <p>"So full-back areas, left-back probably in particular, is an area we will have one eye on definitely for January."</p>
