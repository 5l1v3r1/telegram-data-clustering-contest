      <p>“Everything that is used in medicine has an expiration date,” says <a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/memorialcare-medical-group/find-providers/physician/g-thomas-ruiz-md">G. Thomas Ruiz</a>, MD, OB-GYN Lead at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Centre.</p>
      <p>This includes <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-pick-a-birth-control-2017-11#withdrawal-4">birth control</a>.</p>
      <p>Whether you are using <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-does-birth-control-work">barrier contraceptives, spermicide, or hormonal birth control</a>, it is important that they do what they’re supposed to. Using birth control beyond its expiration date could render it ineffective, putting you at risk for pregnancy or contracting a sexually transmitted infection.</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know about when different birth control methods expire.</p>
      <h3>Condoms expire in 2 to 5 years</h3>
      <p>Some condoms last longer than others. It all depends on what they’re made of. Most condoms contain either latex or polyurethane.</p>
      <p>“Latex and polyurethane condoms last for 5 years if stored properly,” says Dr. Kate Killoran, MD and OB-GYN of Your Doctors Online. “Condoms made from other materials or packaged with spermicide also expire more quickly, usually 2 to 3 years.”</p>
      <p>Once a condom has passed its expiration date, that means it’s no longer as effective.</p>
      <p>“Latex is just like any other product, it has a shelf life. It starts to break down,” says Ruiz. “So, if you use it passed its expiration date, it’s likely to have a failure.”</p>
      <p>In the case of condoms, this means that it could break during intercourse. This could put both users at risk of contracting an STI. And, if you are a woman, you could end up facing an <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-is-a-cryptic-pregnancy">unexpected pregnancy</a>.</p>
      <p>But beware, the material in condoms can break down faster if you don’t store them correctly. Moisture and heat – temperatures above <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/hiv/partners/storage.pdf">104</a> degrees Fahrenheit – are a condom’s worst enemy, so store them in a dry, cool place like your nightstand drawer. Moreover, the CDC warns not to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/condoms-shouldnt-be-washed-or-reused-according-to-cdc-2018-8">wash or reuse condoms</a> because this also makes them less effective.</p>
      <p>When in doubt, toss the condom and get a new one. Condoms are about 98% effective when they are used properly, but improper or inconsistent use drops that number down to <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-does-birth-control-work">82%</a>.</p>
      <h3>Spermicide expires in 2 years</h3>
      <p>Spermicide acts like a sperm disabler. It works in two ways: blocking the entrance to the cervix so sperm can’t get to the egg, and stopping sperm from moving well enough to swim to the egg.</p>
      <p>This method of birth control, when used alone, cannot prevent STIs.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to provide an exact timeline for when spermicide expires because of the variety of products on the market. Typically, the date printed on the packaging is around two years after the manufacture date, according to Killoran.</p>
      <p>Like condoms, using expired spermicide won’t cause harm in the sense that it won’t make you ill. However, it could increase the risk of an unplanned pregnancy.</p>
      <h3>Hormonal birth control expires in about 1 year</h3>
      <p>“When you reach an expiration date, in theory, with any pharmaceutical, anything that has chemicals, you’ve exceeded the storage half-life of the active ingredient,” says Ruiz. “So, basically, you’re using a less concentrated product.”</p>
      <p>Typically, birth control pills expire a year after the manufacture date, according to Killoran. There is some evidence that it will continue to work for a period of time after expiration, but it isn’t clear for how long.</p>
      <p>Other types of birth control, like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/which-iud-is-best-for-me-2016-11">IUDs</a> and arm implants, will also expire, but they tend to have a longer lifespan than the pill. For example, the Mirena IUD is FDA-approved to last 5 years, though studies have shown it can be effective for as long as <a href="https://www.insider.com/mirena-lasts-7-years-paragard-lasts-12-years-iud-2017-5">7 years</a>.</p>
      <p>When it comes to something as life-altering as <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, it simply isn’t worth the risk that comes with using birth control beyond its expiration.</p>
      <p>No matter what kind of birth control you rely on, make sure you check the packaging. Expiration dates are based on the manufacture date, not when you bought them, so the most accurate source of information is the date printed on the package.</p>
