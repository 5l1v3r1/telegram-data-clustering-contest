      <p>Lessons learnt from the the death of a truck driver during a loading incident at a warehouse should improve safety across the transport industry, an inquest at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Kildare">Kildare</a> Coroner’s Court heard.</p>
      <p>Tony McDermott (53) from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Camphill+Park">Camphill Park</a>, Newtownbutler, Co Fermanagh, died from head injuries sustained when he was trapped between a reversing articulated lorry and the side wall of a loading bay at the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=MDS+Distribution">MDS Distribution</a> warehouse at the M7 Business <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Park">Park</a> near <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Naas">Naas</a>, Co Kildare on February 17th, 2017.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard the father of four had gotten off a fork lift truck he was driving in the warehouse to try and alert the driver of the lorry about something. which was unclear to the court.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kevin+Broderick">Kevin Broderick</a>, an inspector with the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Health+and+Safety+Authority">Health and Safety Authority</a>, said Mr McDermott’s death had made the HSA recognise the need for additional safety measures to be rolled out across the industry to prevent a similar type of incident from recurring.</p>
      <p>Kildare County Coroner, Professor <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Denis+Cusack">Denis Cusack</a>, said he hoped Mr McDermott’s family might derive some comfort that his death had resulted in improved safety features being used in warehouses.</p>
      <p>“His tragic death may save some other families from enduring the same heartbreak,” said Professor Cusack.</p>
      <p>A jury of five men and two women returned a verdict of accidental death.</p>
      <p>Professor Cusack said he would bring the jury’s recommendations of introducing rear view cameras on trucks as well as a mechanism for improving communications between drivers and loaders to the attention of the Department of Transport and the HSA.</p>
      <p>MDS Distribution was convicted for breaching Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and fined €25,000 by Naas Circuit <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Criminal+Court">Criminal Court</a> in March over the company’s failure to identify hazards and assess risks in relation to the circumstances leading to Mr McDermott’s death.</p>
      <p>The court heard MDS had subsequently implemented all recommendations made by the HSA.</p>
