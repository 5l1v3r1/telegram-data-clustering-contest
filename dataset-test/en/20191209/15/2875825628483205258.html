      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ant-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> finally took a break from his busy <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle presenting duties to enjoy some well-deserved alone time with his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter, 44, was snapped enjoying a romantic lunch date with his girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett, 42, as he headed out ahead of Sunday night's I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! final.</p>
      <p>The couple ventured slightly out of town from the set of I'm A Celeb and enjoyed a takeaway Japanese meal in the seaside town of Carbarita in New South Wales, Australia.</p>
      <p>The telly favourite made the most of his TV downtime as he treated his girlfriend to a relaxed beach day in the sun-soaked holiday destination.</p>

      <p>Photographers snapped away as Ant affectionately placed his hand on Anne-Marie's back as they patiently waited for their food and happily chatted.</p>
      <p>The loved-up pair looked beach-ready as they sat on a wall outside the Japanese food stop, waiting for their lunch to be cooked.</p>
      <p>Ant showed evidence of their chilled day on the golden beach as sand covered his legs, while he looked as if he had been for a dip in the sea, wearing floral-patterned swimwear.</p>

      <p>The presenter protected himself from Australian's blistering heat with a casual T-shirt, while he wore a pair of designer Gucci flip-flops on his feet.</p>
      <p>Anne-Marie also opted for fashionable beach gear as she showed glimpses of a red bikini hidden under a casual blue shirt dress with a subtle floral embroidered design.</p>
      <p>The beauty kept her golden locks away from her face with a pretty plaited bun while she shielded her eyes from the sunshine with a pair of stylish-looking aviator shades.</p>
      <p>Ant puffed on his vape while he kicked back on the wall and waited for his lunch.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10508214/im-a-celeb-ant-mcpartlin-anne-marie-corbett/">The Sun</a> , the couple then headed to their car before taking the 50-minute journey back to the palatial Versace Hotel where the celebs and their families have been staying while Down Under for the ITV jungle adventure.</p>
      <p>Ant and Anne-Marie touched down in Oz nearly one month ago as he prepared to reprise his presenting role alongside his partner <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/declan-donnelly">Dec Donnelly</a> after he stepped down from his TV duties last year amid his mental health battle.</p>
      <p>This Morning sweetheart Holly Willoughby stepped up to the challenge when she braved the snake-infested jungle as Ant's replacement.</p>

      <p>Ant and Anne-Marie have been inseparable since sparks started flying between the duo.</p>
      <p>Their love has been going strong but they keep their romance out of the limelight where possible.</p>
      <p>The couple recently took their romance to the next level as they moved into their Â£6million lovenest with seven bedrooms.</p>

      <p>They went public with their relationship shortly after the breakdown of Ant's 12-year marriage to Lisa Armstrong.</p>
      <p>Ant's relaxed beach day came ahead of his busiest work night where he presented the live I'm A Celeb 2019 final alongside Dec.</p>
      <p>The duo crowned soap star Jacqueline Jossa as queen of the jungle with Corrie legend Andy Whyment taking second place.</p>
