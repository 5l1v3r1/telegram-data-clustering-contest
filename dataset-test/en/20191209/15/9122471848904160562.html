      <h1>Paul Finebaum Reacts To Arkansas’ Hiring Of Sam Pittman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:36:16+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Arkansas Razorbacks’ hiring of Georgia OL coach Sam Pittman is a questionable decision to say the least. But the strongly opinionated Paul Finebaum isn’t questioning the move just yet.</p>
      <p>It’s unlike Finebaum to not immediately voice his pleasure or displeasure when it comes to certain sports moves. But the SEC Network analyst wants to wait and see before making a judgement call on Pittman.</p>
      <blockquote>“I am going to withhold judgement because I don’t know Sam Pittman very well,” Finebaum said on WJOX Radio, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Sam-Pittman-hired-by-Arkansas-reaction-from-Paul-Finebaum-Georgia-140168445/">247Sports</a>. “I know everyone’s trying to draw the comparisons to (Bret) Bielema. It’s one of the more unusual hires I’ve seen, but maybe that’s what Arkansas needs. … At this point, if you’re Arkansas, you throw stuff against a wall and hope it sticks.”</blockquote>
      <p>Finebaum may be right here. Arkansas has been the laughingstock of the SEC for years now. The program is capable of performing so much better than it currently is.</p>

      <p>Taking a chance on Pittman – a successful assistant and key coach for the Georgia Bulldogs – isn’t all that crazy. As Finebaum points out, it may be exactly what the Razorbacks need.</p>
      <p>For Arkansas to make the necessary improvements to become a competitive team in its conference, recruiting has to be a key factor. If Pittman can gain momentum in the recruiting game, he may be the right guy for Arkansas.</p>
