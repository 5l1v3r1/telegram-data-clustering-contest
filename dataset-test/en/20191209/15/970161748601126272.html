      <p>A young mum was stabbed to death after trying to stop a fight between two men, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>Levi Davis, who was knifed at around 8.30pm on Saturday night, was involved in a two-vehicle crash moments before being stabbed, police have said.</p>
      <p>Now friends have revealed that Miss Davis, 25, who lived less than half-a-mile away from the scene in Rushden, Northamptonshire, was attempting to break up a fight between the two men, both 27, when she was stabbed.</p>
      <p>A woman who knew Miss Davis, but did not want to be named, said: ‘What I’ve been told is two lads were getting into a stabby fight.</p>
      <p>‘She tried to get in the middle and she got stabbed.</p>

      <p>‘It’s awful that she died like this. I can’t say any more but everyone who knew her is absolutely gutted.’</p>
      <p>Speaking at the scene, Superintendent Dennis Murray, of Northamptonshire Police, explained: ‘There was a crash when the vehicles [a black Volkswagen Polo and the other a white Vauxhall van] came together.</p>
      <p>‘My understanding was she was injured when she was outside the vehicle.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘My understanding is that two vehicles were involved in an altercation on Wellingborough Road.</p>
      <p>‘What we don’t know is exactly what part the two vehicles had in this.</p>
      <p>‘We believe the perpetrators appear to be known to each other (and that) she was a passenger. We don’t know if she was driving. We are trying to find out what these vehicles were doing.’</p>

      <p>Miss Davis was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Both men are still being questioned by police, with one being arrested on suspicion of murder. The other is still in hospital and has been arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill the murder suspect.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a boy, 13, has been released with no further action after being arrested on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>Supt Murray continued: ‘Those two cars had an altercation before they came to a stop.</p>
      <p>‘There was a crash when the vehicles came together.’</p>
      <p>Suggesting the incident was ‘isolated’, he urged the community to come forward and said his heart went out to Miss Davis’ family.</p>
      <p>He went on: ‘It is not a random attack or a fight in the street. I am not in a position to confirm things as part of an ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>‘We have to keep an open mind on this. I ask people not to speculate at this time.’</p>
      <p>When asked whether Miss Davis was trying to stop the violence, Supt Murray said: ‘I cannot confirm that at this time.’</p>
      <p>Supt Murray refused to be drawn on why a large detached house nearby was being searched by forensics teams, but said: ‘It is linked to the investigation but I can’t give any more details at this time.’</p>
      <p>Blood stains were visible on the white door frame of the house, worth more than £500,000.</p>
