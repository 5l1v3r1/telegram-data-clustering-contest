        <b>Anthony Joshua has admitted that Islam has played a big role in his boxing career after beating Mexican-American opponent Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Anthony Joshua reclaimed his belts after his victory over Andy Ruiz even though he had to win the fight via unanimous decision.</p>
      <p>In June this year, Anthony Joshua was shocked in New York as he lost for the very first time in his career against Andy Ruiz.</p>
      <p>The defeat propelled him for a rematch against Andy Ruiz which he won on Saturday night, December 7.</p>
      <p>And after his victory over Andy Ruiz, a reporter went to Anthony Joshua to ask him how he feels winning back his titles in a Muslim nation.</p>

      <p><i>''A big role Islam has played in my life because my uncles went to Mecca and pray for me and if a Muslim comes to me and pray for me for blessings. I will respect the person,''</i> Anthony Josshua explained while answering the question.</p>
