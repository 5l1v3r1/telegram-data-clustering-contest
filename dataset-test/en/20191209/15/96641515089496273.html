      <h1>US labor board will investigate Google's recent firings</h1>
      <h2>NLRB is looking into claims that Google discouraged employees from union organizing.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:40:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has launched another investigation into Google. This time, the NLRB is investigating whether Google violated federal labor laws when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-25-google-fires-employee-activist-rebecca-rivers.html">fired four employees</a> late last month. The investigation will determine if Google discouraged employees from engaging in union activity, an NLRB spokesperson told <i>CNBC.</i></p>
      <p>The four employees claim they were fired for protected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html">labor organizing</a>. Last week, they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/12/03/google-employees-report-federal-labor-violations/">filed unfair labor practice charges</a>.</p>
      <p>Google says it fired the four over repeat violations of its data security policies. In a statement provided to Engadget it said:</p>
      <blockquote>"We dismissed four individuals who were engaged in intentional and often repeated violations of our longstanding data security policies, including systematically accessing and disseminating other employees' materials and work. No one has been dismissed for raising concerns or debating the company's activities."</blockquote>
      <p>This isn't the NLRB's first Google investigation. A few months ago, as part of a settlement with the agency, Google agreed to remind employees they can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/12/google-employees-political-discussions-workplace-issues-nlrb/">freely discuss workplace issues</a> and that they do not have to "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/23/google-community-guidelines-politics-workplace/">avoid controversies</a> that are disruptive to the workplace." In other instances, the NLRB has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/17/labor-board-says-google-was-allowed-to-fire-james-damore/">backed Google's decisions</a>, like the one to fire the diversity memo writer James Damore.</p>
      <p>The current investigation is expected to take about three months. Regardless of the outcome, this case is the latest in a string of accusations that Google has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/google-employees-fear-retaliation-culture/">retaliation culture</a>.</p>
