      <h1>How early is too early for holiday decor? Poll puts hot topic to rest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:10:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Yael Halon</a></address>
      <p>It's a longstanding debate: when is the appropriate time to whip out the Christmas decorations?</p>
      <p>In recent years, many have embraced the Christmas spirit early, decorating for the holiday before Thanksgiving rolls around. While others prefer to wait until early December to deck the halls, the question of appropriate timing remains.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to put the hotly debated question to rest, pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, host of<a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=35PercentOff_FNC_Platform"> Fox Nation's</a> brand new show  <a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/what-are-the-odds/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=WhatAreTheOdds_FNC_Platform">"What Are the Odds?"</a> shared the findings of a recent poll on <a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/all-american-christmas-at-fox-square/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=AllAmericanChristmasFOXSquare_FNC_Platform">Fox Nation's</a> Christmas special <a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/all-american-christmas-at-fox-square/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=AllAmericanChristmasFOXSquare_FNC_Platform">"All American Christmas on Fox Square."</a></p>

      <p>"I'm one of those people who put up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving," she added, as her fellow co-hosts booed from the audience.</p>
      <p>Co-host Ainsley Earhardt came to Mele's defense.</p>
      <p>"I do, too," she admitted. "I love it, I can't get enough."</p>

      <p>"Decorating your house early extends those magical childhood emotions from times gone by, which can only serve as a constant reminder causing positive psychological changes that affect your mood," Steve McKeown, a psychoanalyst, <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1523576/decorating-your-home-holidays-early-makes-you-happier">told Martha Stewart Living</a>.</p>
      <p>Many on Twitter had mixed reactions to the November holiday decor debate, some calling it a "crime" while others expressed support for the early lights and wreaths.</p>

      <p>"Christmas music and decorations in November should be a crime," one user wrote.</p>
