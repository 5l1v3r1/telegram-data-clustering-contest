      <p>The 21-year-old midfielder is currently on loan at Port Vale, with that deal set to run out next month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/jake-taylor-port-vale-forest-3544869">The League Two side have made it clear</a> they would like to extend his stay, but it seems they could face some competition - including from higher up the football pyramid.</p>

      <p>Taylor has six goals in 20 appearances for Vale in all competitions so far this season.</p>
      <p>The report adds: “Vale, who could try to keep Taylor on an extended loan or a permanent deal, would hope to be in pole position if rival offers are all from League Two clubs.</p>
      <p>“But if a League One club makes a bid, both <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> and the player would have to weigh up playing regularly in John Askey's side against the possibility if playing at a higher level.”</p>
