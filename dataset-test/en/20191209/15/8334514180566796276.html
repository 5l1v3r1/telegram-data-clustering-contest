      <p>(Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/XRX.N">XRX.N</a>) expects its proposed acquisition of personal computer company HP Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/HPQ.N">HPQ.N</a>) to result in sales growth of as much as $1.5 billion for the combined company, according to a presentation by the printer maker.</p>
      <p>The presentation, addressed to HP shareholders, comes two weeks after Xerox said it was planning to take its $33.5 billion buyout bid directly to HP shareholders after HP refused to open its books for due diligence.</p>
      <p>Xerox said revenue growth of $1 billion to $1.5 billion can be achieved through a three-year roadmap, which involves cross-selling products and streamlining operations.</p>
      <p>The combined company will have a free cash flow of more than $4 billion in the first year before any synergies, Xerox added.</p>
      <p>Last month, HP rejected Xerox’s $22 per share offer that consists of $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox share for each HP share, saying the offer “significantly undervalues HP”.</p>
      <p>HP, however, has left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer and said it can evaluate the merits by a due diligence of Xerox.</p>
