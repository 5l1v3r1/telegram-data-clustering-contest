      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-vs-celtic-aftermath-live-21055341">Rangers</a> player today admitted being behind the wheel of a high-performance car with no licence and no insurance.</p>
      <p>Winger <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/eros-grezda-suffers-rangers-blow-20894936">Eros Grezda</a> , 24, was driving his Audi RS3 last month when he was pulled over by cops in Glasgow's Kelvinbridge.</p>
      <p>Grezda, who represented himself at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/brute-who-shattered-mans-jaw-21042407">Glasgow Sheriff Court</a> claimed he did not realise his insurance had lapsed because he had not checked his mail.</p>

      <p>He admitted driving without insurance and not having a valid licence and was fined £400.</p>
      <p>The court heard Grezda was banned from driving for six months in March this year, and should have applied for a new licence when the disqualification ended.</p>
      <p>Grezda told the court that he thought he had paid his insurance by direct debit and added: “I wasn’t aware that they had refunded the money back into my account.</p>
      <p>“They wanted information from my drivers licence but I didn’t reply as I didn’t see it.</p>
      <p>“I never saw the mail as I never checked the mail I was sure I had insurance.”</p>

      <p>Sheriff Barry Divers asked if the insurance company could have been getting in touch because he had been disqualified, Grezda replied: “Maybe.”</p>
      <p>Grezda, of Glasgow's Kelvinside, told the court: “I wish to apologise to the court for this incident. I didn't intend to drive without insurance and I hope this will be taken into consideration.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Barry Divers ordered his licence to be endorsed with six penalty points.</p>
