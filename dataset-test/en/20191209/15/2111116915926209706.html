      <p>Get 5G on a budget</p>

      <p>5G is typically expensive but it doesn’t have to be, as right now you can get the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/moto-z4-review">Moto Z4</a> for the remarkably low price of just $10 per month over 24 months.</p>
      <p>That price is for the Moto Z4 from Verizon in Frost White or Flash Gray. It’s down from a standard price of $20.83 per month – so it’s less than half price, coming out at just $240 overall.</p>
      <p>Technically, the Moto Z4 isn’t actually a 5G phone, but it can be – all you have to do is attach the 5G Moto Mod (sold separately for $349.99). So it’s still a relatively affordable way to get a 5G handset, especially at this discounted price. In fact, even at full price we declared this the cheapest of 2019’s 5G-capable handsets in our review.</p>

      <p>And with or without 5G, the Moto Z4 is worth considering for your next phone. This is a decent mid-range handset, with a Snapdragon 675 chipset, 4GB of RAM, a 6.4-inch 1080 x 2340 OLED screen, a 48MP rear camera, and a 25MP front-facing one.</p>
      <p>It also supports all Motorola’s other Moto Mods, so if you want an extra battery, better speakers, or a number of other things, you can clip them on.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear how long this $10 per month offer will last, so if you’ve been eyeing up the Moto Z4 or a 5G phone in general, now’s the time to buy, and with Christmas around the corner it could also make a great present.</p>
