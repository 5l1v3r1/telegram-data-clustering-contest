      <p>The brand new <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Bose Headphones 700</a> that are replacing the Quiet Comfort 35 Series II headphones, just got their first price drop. We're looking at $50 off of its regular price, down to $349.</p>
      <p>Considering Bose products rarely ever see any form of price drops, this is actually a pretty big deal. And now is definitely the time to pick up a pair.</p>
      <p>The Bose Headphones 700 are noise cancelling headphones, and do a really great job at doing just that. We're looking at 11 levels of noise cancelling, so you can control distractions and/or let in some ambient sound. This becomes very important when you are walking down the street or on the subway, so you can hear what's going on around you.</p>

      <p>Battery life on the Bose Headphones 700 are rated for around 20 hours of usage. That is with noise cancellation turned on. So you can turn those off and get even better battery life.</p>
      <p>The design on the Bose Headphones 700 is pretty interesting. Much different from its other headphones. But these are meant to be lighter, so they are more comfortable to wear for many hours on end.</p>
      <p>Bose has also included Amazon Alexa support on these headphones. So you can talk to Alexa in any environment using the Bose Headphones 700. There are four adaptive microphones built-in, so it can isolate your voice from the surrounding noise.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>You can access Alexa with the push of a button, or by using the wake word. You can ask Alexa for all of the usual stuff like weather, navigation, text messages and so forth. It can also speak to you in English or Spanish.</p>
      <p>There is support for Google Assistant on the Bose Headphones 700 as well.</p>
