      <p>Last weekend, <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Maximum_Security_1">Maximum Security</a></b> continued a likely ascent to 3-year old champion male status by capturing the <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Cigar_Mile">Cigar Mile</a></b>. Here's a glance at some of the HRN reader reaction.</p>
      <p>Responding to an assertion that Spun to Run would get to the lead early based off of recent workouts,<i> leo r</i> respectfully disagreed, stating he felt Maximum Security, though the high weight, could carry his speed and would win in gate-to-wire fashion.</p>

      <p>After the race, user <i>Chris Miskell</i> opined that he had plenty of doubts about Maximum Security in the past, but the Cigar Mile victory changed all of that.</p>

      <p>And finally, user <i>MaiyaDay</i> provided some insight on the Beyer Speed Figure attached to the Cigar Mile victor as well as tough luck second place finisher Spun to Run, who tracked Maximum Security for the entirety of the race.</p>
