      <p>A teenager has scooped her second award in recognition of her hard work.</p>
      <p>The Centre, Livingston, welcomed Mirhan Smith (19) into the mall to collect her well-deserved Local Hero Award.</p>
      <p>She also picked up a £100 gift card in recognition of her outstanding achievements which also led her to win a recent Apprentice of the Year Award.</p>
      <p>Following the completion of her trainee chef apprenticeship at The Larder Cook School, which is a social enterprise that supports disadvantaged youngsters, Mirhan who completed her qualifications in record time, won a Skills Development Scotland Apprenticeships Award.</p>
      <p>Mirhan, the double award winner, who has recently secured the position of a kitchen assistant in a city centre hotel, said: “I was over the moon with joy when I was invited into The Centre, Livingston to collect my Local Hero Award.</p>
      <p>“I still can’t believe I’ve won two now and in such a short space of time - I am so happy and proud of myself and can’t thank the management team at the mall enough for recognising and rewarding me for all my achievements.”</p>
      <p>Ashley Bisland, deputy director at The Centre, Livingston, said: “Mirhan is definitely worthy of winning our Local Hero Award – her hard work and dedication has paid off and we wish her all the very best and a bright future ahead.”</p>
      <p>Courier editor Marjorie Kerr added: “Well done to Mirhan, we wish her every luck in her future career.”</p>
      <p>If you know someone who you think should be nominated for the Local Hero Award, maybe they’ve gone the extra mile to help others in the community, such as volunteering in a community group, fundraising or caring for family members or even excelled at school or in a sports club and deserves recognition, please send an email with the details to  <a href="mailto:debbie.hall@trinitymirror.com">debbie.hall@trinitymirror.com</a> .</p>
