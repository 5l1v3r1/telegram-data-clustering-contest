      <h3>A final report on the inquiry into the Northern Village of Pinehouse is expected to be delivered to the province before the end of the year, the Ministry of Government Relations says.</h3>
      <p>In an email to The StarPhoenix, the ministry confirmed the formal portion of the inquiry conducted by former justice William Vancise has concluded; the ministry said the government “is committed” to releasing the inquiry and inspection report to the public, but has not yet received Vancise’s report.</p>
      <p>Former government relations minister Warren Kaeding appointed Neil Robertson last December to conduct an inspection of Pinehouse following a recommendation in what was the <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/province-should-investigate-pinehouse-privacy-commissioner-says">13th review report by Saskatchewan Information and Privacy Commissioner Ron Kruzeniski on the village’s non-compliance with responding to requests made under the Local Authority Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.</a></p>
      <p>Following Robertson’s March inspection report, Kaeding ordered an inquiry into the village’s operations. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/ex-queens-bench-sask-court-of-appeal-judge-appointed-to-oversee-pinehouse-inquiry">Vancise was appointed to take over the inquiry after Robertson was appointed to the Court of Queen’s Bench</a>.</p>
      <p>In the report, which the StarPhoenix obtained earlier this year, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/inspector-asked-kaeding-to-consider-removing-pinehouse-mayor-councillor-report">Robertson recommended that Kaeding consider whether it was in the public’s interest to remove Pinehouse Mayor Mike Natomagan and Coun. Conrad Misponas from their elected positions</a>.</p>
      <p>According to a letter to Vancise from Kaeding, which the StarPhoenix obtained via a freedom of information request, the minister ordered him “to conduct an inquiry into the conduct of two members of the Council of the Northern Village of Pinehouse.” The June 6 letter does not name the two members of the village’s council at the centre of the investigation.</p>
      <p>The piece of information in Robertson’s report that led Kaeding to call the inquiry was redacted in the version of the minister’s order paper the ministry provided to the StarPhoenix.</p>
      <p>When asked why the province did not tell the public that Vancise would be investigating the conduct of two village councillors as part of the inquiry, and which councillors are the subject of this probe, the ministry said in an emailed response that the formal inquiry process led by Vancise is “strictly confidential and as such the province cannot provide any information that may breach that confidentiality.”</p>
      <p>The terms of reference in the order state that the report is to be prepared for the minister — now Lori Carr — by Sept. 30, unless the minister grants an extension. The terms of reference granted Vancise the ability to determine the rules, process and procedure for the inquiry, subject to a requirement that the inquiry proceedings will not be open to the public.</p>
      <p>D’Arcy Hande, a member of a working group that has been filing freedom of information requests to the village. including requests which resulted in the privacy commissioner reports that triggered the inspection, said he appeared as a witness at the Vancise inquiry this fall.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Government Relations did not provide any information about inquiry hearings.</p>
      <p>“The hearings related to the inquiry into the northern Village of Pinehouse are arranged, held and scheduled at the discretion of the Inquiry Officer (Mr. Vancise), not the Government of Saskatchewan,” a ministry spokesperson wrote in an email.</p>
      <p>In launching the inquiry, the ministry also appointed a supervisor to the village, Hasan Akhtar, and ordered an audit of the village’s finances.</p>
      <p>Akhtar’s mandate includes approving bylaws or resolutions that authorize the village to incur a liability, attend all meetings of council, oversee the village’s operations and monitor its progress in carrying out the recommendations outlined in Robertson’s March 7 inspection report.</p>
      <p>The StarPhoenix was provided a copy of an email sent to Akhtar from the executive director of Northern Municipal Services within the ministry, Brad Henry, in which he told Akhtar that it was “critical for the success” of the processes in relation to Pinehouse that he “simplify, and reduce, our direct involvement in the municipality’s affairs, and take active steps to ensure all communications are, and appear to be, professional, appropriate, fair, and purposeful.</p>
      <p>“We know that there have been communication difficulties with the Village to-date. Knowing this, it is critical that we actively minimize opportunities for additional conflict. To reduce this potential, it is imperative that, in relation to the Minister’s Order appointing yourself as supervisor for Pinehouse, you narrow your role to its proper intent,” Henry wrote.</p>
      <p>In response to a query about the email, a ministry spokesperson explained in an email to The StarPhoenix that the supervisor, Akhtar, had made a request for written clarification regarding the role and responsibilities of a “supervisor.”</p>
      <p>When reached by phone, village administrator Martine Smith said the village did not wish to comment about the inquiry process drawing to a close, nor about the direction given to Vancise to investigate the conduct of two members of the village’s council. She said the village is just waiting for the outcome.</p>
