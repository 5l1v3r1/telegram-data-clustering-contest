          <b>Serial rapist Joseph McCann has received 33 life sentences after a string of sex attacks on women and children.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The judge handing out the sentence called McCann "a coward, a violent bully and paedophile”.</p>
      <p>McCann, 34, was found guilty on Friday at the Old Bailey of 37 counts including rape, kidnap and false imprisonment during a rampage that stretched from London to Cheshire.</p>
      <p>He will serve a minimum of 30 years behind bars.</p>

      <p>Last spring, McCann became Britain's most wanted man as he travelled the country abducting his victims at knifepoint.</p>
      <p>McCann's youngest victim an 11-year-old boy, and the oldest was a 71-year-old woman.</p>
      <p>Cops tracked him down on May 6 just hours after he forced two 14-year-old girls into a car.</p>
      <p>McCann began his descent into crime as a child, thieving and torching neighbours' cars in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Aged 14, he became one of the first teenagers to be given an Anti Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) for terrorising local residents.</p>
      <p>The son of a Scottish builder and a mum with links to the traveller community, McCann was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection in 2008 when he burgled the home of an 85-year-old man and held a knife to his throat.</p>
      <p>McCann later insisted he wanted to "live a crime free life" to look after his partner and two children.</p>
      <p>Following his release from an indeterminate sentence for public protection, McCann broke into a house in Bedfordshire on July 22, 2017, and was jailed for three years, serving only half.</p>
      <p>After 18-months inside, he should have gone before a parole board hearing before his release – as he was still subject to the life sentence.</p>
      <p>However, he was released without the meeting on February 15 this year because prison staff were unaware he had been handed a life term.</p>

      <p>His series of sex attacks began weeks later.</p>
      <p>McCann did not appear in court himself, but instructed his barrister to make a series of bizarre claims insisting that his victims either consented to sex – or it didn't happen.</p>
