      <p>Jack Black left Karen Gillan in stitches after improvising a song about farting to the tune of Bon Jovi’s You Give Love A Bad Name.</p>
      <p>While discussing the line “You’re body is a loaded gun” in their new movie Jumanji: The Next Level, Black said: “My body is a loaded gun for a different reason, I always keep one locked and loaded, in the chamber.</p>
      <p>The Tenacious D singer then freestyled several verses of a song, complete with fart noises.</p>
      <p>Lyrics included: “Shot to the fart and you’re too late, you gave hot farts a bad name.”</p>
      <p>He added: “You ate some beans and then you laid your game…”</p>
      <p>However, he regretted the direction his improvised lyrics had taken him in, saying: “Laid your game? Laid your egg might have been better. Like an egg fart.”</p>
      <p>Jumanji: The Next Level is released in UK cinemas on December 11.</p>
