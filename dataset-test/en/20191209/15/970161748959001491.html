      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/richard-hammond/">Richard Hammond</a> is getting ready to kick off the new year – and new decade! – in a BIG way.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-grand-tour/">Grand Tour</a> host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/02/grand-tours-richard-hammond-quaking-faces-biggest-fear-solo-show-oh-god-11255648/">announced his new solo TV show, BIG, earlier this year</a>, and the series will debut on the Discovery Channel in the UK on 15 January.</p>
      <p>The 10-part series will see the presenter travelling across the globe to get up close and personal with some of the biggest structures, machines and vessels that the world has to offer.</p>

      <p>He’ll also speak to a range of engineers to find out how they manage to build, use and maintain these gigantic structures.</p>
      <p>Hammond reminded his followers about the imminent arrival of the series with the presentation of a new trailer earlier today (9 December).</p>
      <p>‘It’s bold, it’s brilliant and well, it’s BIG!’ Hammond told his <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardHammond/status/1204022814640136192">Twitter</a> followers about the show in a post to accompany the 15-second teaser clip.</p>

      <p>During the trailer, the host asks one tunnel engineer about the dangers of a potentially explosive procedure after he’s invited to give it a go.</p>
      <p>‘If I do it wrong, are we all blown to pieces?’ Hammond nervously asks the expert.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe?’ comes the unsure reply, before the camera cuts to a massive explosion blasting through a tunnel.</p>
      <p>Guess we’ll find out if Hammond and co. survived to make it to a second series on 15 January…</p>
