      <p>Mr Davies, who represented the Mid Wales constituency for the Tories from 2010, stood down last month.</p>
      <p>Now he has voiced his opinion on this week's election, as he predicts a gain for the Conservatives in Wales – but he has remained tight-lipped on where those seats will be.</p>
      <p>Writing on Facebook he said: "On the sprint for home in the race to be elected to the House of Commons on Thursday. Still don’t feel able to go definite on what I think will be the result at the UK level. But it’s time to make an early guess, though need to add a health warning. I’m not the best political psephologist. And anyway, even though I’m not a candidate myself this time, I don’t want to be too definitive until 10pm on election night.</p>
      <p>"I do think all the existing Welsh Conservative MPs will be re-elected.</p>
      <p>"And also the two seats that have been held by Welsh Conservatives, who are standing down.</p>
      <p>"And I think the Conservatives will win an additional four seats. We could even win more. And I know which I think they will be, but not going to name them till 10pm Thursday. Don’t want to tempt fate."</p>
