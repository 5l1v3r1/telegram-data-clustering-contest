      <h1>LOHA designs affordable housing complex for difficult site in Los Angeles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T15:00:11+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/jenna-mcknight/" target="_blank">Jenna McKnight</a></address>
      <p>American firm <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/loha/">LOHA</a> has unveiled plans for an <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/low-cost-housing/">affordable housing</a> complex in Los Angeles, comprising stacks of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/shipping-containers/">shipping containers</a> arranged on a triangular site near a busy highway interchange.</p>
      <p>The complex, called Isla Intersections, is slated to be built on a three-sided parcel that is just under a half-acre. Located in South LA, the property is near "one of the world's busiest freeway interchanges", said local firm <a href="http://loharchitects.com/">LOHA</a> (Lorcan O'Herlihy Architects) â€“ a winner of a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/dezeen-awards-2019-winners/">2019 Dezeen Award</a>.</p>
      <p>For the challenging site, LOHA has envisioned a housing block with stretches of green space. The complex, slated to open next year, is reserved for tenants who were formerly homeless.</p>
      <p>The design features a series of 16 "staggered towers" arranged around a central courtyard. Walkways and pocket parks encircle the cluster of buildings, forming a "green lung" that filters car emissions and other air pollutants.</p>

      <p>"The landscaping is site-specific, with trees, shrubs and vines chosen for their ability to clean the air and offer a respite from the sea of concrete enclosing the site," the studio said.</p>
      <p>The tower heights vary. On the east side, where the site approaches a low-scale neighbourhood, the buildings transition from five storeys to two. This side of the complex runs along Broadway, a major thoroughfare.</p>
      <p>On the property's west side, which is more pedestrian-friendly, the design incorporates a tree-lined promenade, envisioned as a "slow space" that preferences walkers and cyclists.</p>
      <p>"Our aim was to create something that was compartmental but solid, strong enough to withstand the demands of the project's location but porous enough to engage the residents on a human scale with outdoor activities and places to work and socialise," the firm said of the overall scheme.</p>

        <figcaption>It will comprise 16 staggered towers built from shipping containers</figcaption>

      <p>The complex is designed to be quickly constructed using steel shipping containers. The team has designed a modular unit that consists of three containers welded together. The units are then stacked to form interconnected towers with shared circulation.</p>
      <p>The 480-square-foot (45-square-metre) units will feature "compact and efficient" interior layouts. Each will serve as a one-bedroom apartment that complies with requirements outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>
      <p>The proposed design would result in 54 individual apartments and a total square footage of 34,000 square feet (3,159 square metres). In addition to the apartments, the scheme calls for retail and support spaces.</p>

      <p>"While the project is predominantly residential and green space, the ground level along the paseo will provide a number of storefront spaces for retail, incubation and job training and support services, as well as administrative offices," the firm said.</p>
      <p>The plan also calls for rooftop farms and edible gardens, which will provide fresh food for tenants.</p>
      <p>"This project has the chance to become part of a larger network of urban farms in the area, whose mission is to preserve the tradition of farming in South Los Angeles, bringing affordable produce to what many consider a food desert," the team said.</p>
      <p>The architects cited the Stanford Avalon Community Garden, a nine-acre (3.6-hectare) urban farm that sits under power lines in the Watts neighbourhood.</p>

      <p>"Isla aspires to build on their legacy, harnessing the potential to be a part of a much larger green lung that can potentially wind its way through the city," the studio said.</p>
      <p>The Isla Intersections project is part of an initiative by the City of Los Angeles to address its housing crisis. In 2018, more than 1,700 city-owned parcels were made available to developers of affordable housing, according to LOHA.</p>
      <p>The sites are less than ideal, with many located near freeways or situated along heavy traffic corridors. In some instances, the sites are a composition of parcels that "have been left untouched for decades".</p>
      <p>"It is in this kind of liminal space, fraught with ambiguity, that we see opportunity, and a potentially significant next step for the future of housing in the city," said the firm.</p>
      <p>LOHA was founded in 1987 and is run by Irish architect Lorcan O'Herlihy. Isla Intersections marks its second collaboration with Clifford Beers Housing, a nonprofit developer. The other is MLK1101, a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/08/08/mlk1101-housing-loha-los-angeles/">housing complex in LA for homeless residents</a> that features white facades and a sloped green roof. The project was named <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/10/15/dezeen-awards-2019-architecture-winners/">housing project of the year in the 2019 Dezeen Awards</a>.</p>
      <p>Other projects by the firm include student housing at a university in central California, an <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/10/30/loha-san-vicente-935-apartment-building-west-hollywood-los-angeles/">apartment building in West Hollywood</a>, and a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/05/22/loha-creates-mariposa1038-housing-block-curvilinear-courtyard-koreatown-los-angeles/">housing block in LA's Koreatown</a>.</p>
