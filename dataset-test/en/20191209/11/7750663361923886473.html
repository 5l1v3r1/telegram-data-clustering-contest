      <p>Despite being sent to Elland Road to be provided with regular first-team football, the 20-year-old has been given just 12 substitute appearances in the Championship.</p>
      <p>The lack of game time has led to speculation over the striker's immediate future, with it being suggested that the Gunners could send the England Under-21 international to another club.</p>
      <p>However, <i>The Sun</i> claims that Nketiah will see out the campaign at Leeds, who are attempting to secure promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Nkeitah has scored two goals from 289 minutes of football in the Championship, while another three strikes have come from two starts in the EFL Cup.</p>
