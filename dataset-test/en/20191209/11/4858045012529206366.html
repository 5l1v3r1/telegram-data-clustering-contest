      <p>In 2018, households in the European Union (EU) spent 12.1% of their total consumption expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverages, with Romanian, Lithuanian and Estonian household topping the list, according to data published on Monday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat). </p>
      <p>In 2018, households in the European Union (EU) spent over 1,047 billion (equivalent to 6.6% of EU GDP) on food and non-alcoholic beverages, the third largest category of household expenditure after housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, which accounted for 24.0% of household expenditure, and transport, which accounted for 13.2%. <br/><br/>Households in Romania spent around a fifth of total household consumption expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverages (27.8%). The next highest shares were in Lithuania (20.9%) and Estonia (19.6%). In contrast, the figure was below 10% in four EU member states: the United Kingdom (7.8%), Ireland (8.7%), Luxembourg (9.1%) and Austria (9.7%). <br/><br/>Between 2008 and 2018, the share of total household expenditure on food decreased or remained stable in most EU member states where 2018 data is available. <br/><br/>The largest decrease was recorded in Lithuania (from 24.8% of total household expenditure in 2008 to 20.9% in 2018, or a fall of 3.9 percentage points), followed by Poland (-3.4%) and Malta (-3.0%). <br/><br/>In contrast, household expenditure on food increased in 10 EU member states where 2018 data is available. The largest increase was recorded in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (both +1.4pp), the Netherlands (+1.0pp) and Hungary (+0.8pp).</p>
