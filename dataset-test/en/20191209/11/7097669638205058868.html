      <p>Berlin (AFP) - The cuteness level at Berlin Zoo doubled on Monday when a pair of twin panda cubs made their public debut, with the zoo revealing the cuddly bundles of fur were both boys.</p>
      <p>The little ones were born at the zoo on August 31 but in keeping with Chinese tradition they were only named after 100 days.</p>
      <p>Speaking before a crowd of excited reporters at the Panda Garden, zoo director Andreas Knieriem announced that the cubs would go by the names of Meng Xiang, meaning "long-awaited dream" and Meng Yuan, or "dream come true".</p>
      <p>The twins, weighing around six kilos (13 pounds) each, then made their long-awaited first appearance before the world's media.</p>
      <p>Wheeled out in a glass-cased "panda bed", they were seen lounging close together on a heated mattress.</p>
      <p>One of the cubs appeared half-asleep and unfazed by the attention, while his more active brother repeatedly turned his back on the press pack, prompting coos and laughter.</p>
      <p>But the general public will have to wait a little longer for their own glimpse of the zoo's newest stars.</p>
      <p>The cubs will be kept away from visitors "until they can walk properly" and are more familiar with their surroundings, Knieriem said, expected to be sometime in early 2020.</p>
      <p>The birth of the cubs has delighted Berlin's oldest zoo as it is notoriously hard to breed pandas -- and twins are even rarer.</p>
      <p>Their mother Meng Meng and male giant panda Jiao Qing arrived in Berlin in June 2017 to great fanfare.</p>
      <p>China lends pandas to zoos around the world -- a programme dubbed "panda diplomacy".</p>
      <p>Berlin zoo pays $15 million (13.5 million euros) for a 15-year contract to host the adult pandas, with most of the money going towards a conservation and breeding research programme in China.</p>
      <p>While the twin cubs were born in Berlin, they remain Chinese and must be returned to China within four years after they have been weaned.</p>
      <p>About 1,864 pandas remain in the wild in China, up from around 1,000 in the late 1970s, according to the environmental group WWF.</p>
      <p>Just over 400 pandas live in zoos around the world, in conservation projects set up with Beijing.</p>
      <p>The species is considered "vulnerable" to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
