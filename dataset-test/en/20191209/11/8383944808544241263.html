      <p>Police now stand guard around a replacement banana artwork valued at tens of thousands of dollars after the original was eaten off the wall at an art gallery in Miami, Florida, reported local media.<br/><br/>After Italian sculptor Maurizio Cattelan's banana artwork taped to a wall in the Perrotin at Art Basel gallery sold for $120,000, it was eaten on Saturday by David Datuna, a performance artist, who shared his feat on social media.<br/><br/>In his post, Datuna said the artwork was delicious and added that he admired works by Cattelan.<br/><br/>After a replacement banana was put on display, police were put on duty to prevent a similar theft.<br/><br/>Luckily for the buyer, the artwork has a certificate of authenticity that enables replacement of the banana.<br/><br/>Cattelan produced a total of three banana artworks regarded as a critique of international commerce. The first two sold for $120,000 and the third is expected to net $150,000.<br/><br/>In September, a solid gold toilet by Cattelan which he named "America," valued at $6 million, was stolen from England's Blenheim Palace where it was displayed.</p>
