      <h1>Changes approved at Bolton skip hire site despite local health fears</h1>
      <h2>A local councillor says Lostock Skip Hire is linked to a spate of coughs, skin irritation and asthma</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:59:38+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Timan, Local Democracy Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Plans for a new access road and office at a <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bolton">skip hire site near Bolton</a> have been given the go-ahead despite complaints from neighbours.</p>
      <p>Lostock Skip Hire in Star Lane was granted permission for the proposal after councillors said the changes would improve conditions for residents.</p>
      <p>But Horwich town councillor David Grant told the committee that recent work at the site had resulted in two children being admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties.</p>
      <p>He said: “Last year residents started to complain of coughs, skin irritations exasperated asthmatic conditions.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Grant said that the health problems the residents suffered could be linked to the company being given permission by the Environment Agency to increase its waste processing from 19k tonnes to 56k tonnes.</p>
      <p>He also raised concerns about flooding, privacy and lighting.</p>
      <p>Cllr Elaine Sherrington said she had sympathy for the residents but noted that the land was designated for that type of use.</p>
      <p>She said: “I do think we are trying very hard to get it right and I do think what they are doing regarding this road is improving their lives, not making it worse.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Sean Hornby said there were some valid objections but also said that drainage would be better as a result of the changes.</p>
      <p>He urged the council to make sure that the new access road is not used by heavy goods vehicles.</p>
      <p>Cllr Bob Allen said that Lostock Skip Hire has been located in the area for much longer than many of the new properties that surrounds it.</p>
      <p>He said: “Buyers of houses adjacent to a skip yard should be aware.”</p>
      <p>The plans were approved.</p>
