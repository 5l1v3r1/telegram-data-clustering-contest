      <p>REUTERS: House Democrats and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are nearing a deal to pass a revised version of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Wall Street Journal reported late on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

      <p>The Democrats and U.S. President Donald Trump's trade negotiator have differences on enforcement of labor rules, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The Democrats are reviewing a proposal from the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Journal reported.</p>
      <p>The USMCA, signed about a year ago, must be passed by lawmakers in all three countries, including the U.S. Congress.</p>
      <p>Democratic lawmakers have held up U.S. ratification over concerns about how labor and environmental provisions would be enforced.</p>
      <p>Canada has said it is waiting on ratification in order to move in tandem with the United States. Mexican lawmakers earlier this year approved the deal.</p>
