      <p>Peter Purves has been left "stunned" and hurt" after being dropped as commentator for Channel Four's Crufts after 41 years. <br/><br/>The legendary actor and presenter, 80, spoke to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain today about the shocking decision. <br/><br/>Crufts is an annual dog event held at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham and sees canines compete in several competitions in the hope of becoming 'Best in Show.'</p>

      <p>The former Blue Peter presenter admitted that "there's a void" there now that he's been sacked.</p>
      <p>Piers Morgan slammed the network's decision, branding it as "ageist" and "cruel," the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/piers-morgan-slams-ageist-channel-21055425">Daily Star</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the events leading up to his sacking, Peter said: "I got an email back saying 'that's wonderful news, we'll talk to you about Crufts as soon as we can.' <br/><br/>"The following day I got a phone call saying 'there's no easy way to say this, but you're actually surplus the requirements, we don't need you.'"</p>
      <p>Peter went on to say the decision came as quite the surprise as there was no warning or consensus that things needed to change.</p>
      <p>"I was stunned," he told GMB viewers. <br/><br/>"There hadn't been a hint about it.</p>
      <p>"I was very shocked. I was very hurt."</p>
      <p>Viewers soon took to Twitter to express their frustration and blasted Channel Four's decision.</p>
      <p>One said: "He has been a huge part of our lives. Disgraceful of Crufts."</p>
      <p>A second added: "Peter Purves, a legend for my generation, put out to seed by Channel 4 â€“ scandalous."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Poor Peter Purves! Ageism goes right to the top, clearly."</p>
