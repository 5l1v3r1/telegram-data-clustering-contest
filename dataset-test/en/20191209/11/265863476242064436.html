      <p>Ella Balinska wore Miu Miu to the British Independent Film Awards and the <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> actress was absolutely stunning. Celebrity makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury did Ella’s face and she sparkled on the red carpet. Ella is making her name in the industry and has quickly been added to various “ones to watch” lists. Standing 5’10”, Ella put on a leggy display in the beautiful Miu Miu mini dress that flattered her figure and enhanced her feminine appeal.</p>
      <p>Ella thanked the awards for letting her present in a sweet post that you may read below.</p>

      <p>Jason Bolden styled Ella for the event and did an incredible job. Her jewelry was from Cartier and she dripped in diamonds. Her shoes were Kurt Geiger and they consisted of taupe pumps that were the perfect accessory to her dress.</p>
      <p>Charlotte Tilbury shared a close-up photo of Ella’s makeup and the look was glamorous. Ella’s skin looked creamy and silky while Charlotte paid special attention to her eyes. Charlotte used her Palette of Pops in Celestial Eyes and corner lashes to help create the cat-eye look on the stunning 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>Ella’s eyes sparkled underneath a layer of glittering rose-gold covered lids.

      <p>Charlotte chose beautiful soft rose hues for Ella’s lips in Foxy Brown and she added a nice layer of gloss that complemented Ella’s natural beauty.</p>
