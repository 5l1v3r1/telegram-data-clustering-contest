      <h1>Fikile Mbalula: Prasa Placed Under Administration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:47:48+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has announced that the interim board of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has been dissolved with immediate effect and that it has been placed under administration.</p>
      <p>Mbalula made the announcement at a press briefing on Monday morning. He said Prasa had deep-rooted problems and merely replacing an interim board with a permanent one would not solve the problem.</p>
      <p>The interim board was appointed in April 2018 but has failed to turn the ailing state-owned entity around.</p>
