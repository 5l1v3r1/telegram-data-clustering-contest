      <p>A while back, it was said that the Galaxy S11 series will utilize a "new" 108-megapixel sensor by <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a>. Well, a tipster now released some additional info regarding that, claiming that the Galaxy S11+ will utilize an "exclusive custom" 108MP ISOCELL sensor.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1203653088407511040?s=09">information</a> comes from Ice Universe, a well-known tipster. He claims that the device will use a 1/1.3-inch 108-megapixel "exclusive custom" sensor. He also noted that the quality of this sensor beats out the ISOCELL Bright HMX.</p>
      <p>To those of you who do not know, the ISOCELL Bright HMX is a 108-megapixel sensor that Samsung developed in partnership with Xiaomi. This sensor is already included in some of Xiaomi's devices.</p>

      <p>It seems like Samsung is preparing something more powerful for the Galaxy S11+. It's quite interesting that the source did not mention the Galaxy S11 series, but the S11+ in specific. It is suggesting that the Galaxy S11+ will have an upper hand in the camera department, over its siblings.</p>
      <h3>Samsung's new "exclusive" 108MP ISOCELL sensor for the Galaxy S11+ will not be cheap</h3>
      <p>The last piece of information that Ice Universe shared has to do with the pricing of this sensor. The exclusive custom 108MP ISOCELL sensor that Samsung will allegedly use in the Galaxy S11+ will be expensive. The source simply said that it "has a high cost".</p>
      <p>The most interesting part of all this is that the other Galaxy S11 devices have not been mentioned. The Galaxy S11+ could stand on its own thanks to this new sensor.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Just to be clear, this is not an upgrade on top of the Bright HMX. This will allegedly be a new sensor that will be the same size as the Bright HMX.</p>
      <p>It was expected that Samsung will <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/galaxy-s11-may-utilize-a-new-108-megapixel-camera-sensor.html">develop something new</a> for the Galaxy S11 series. Why? Well, the Bright HMX is considered to be an upper mid-range sensor, not something that would set the Galaxy S11 series apart from the rest.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11+ will arrive along with the Galaxy S11e and S11. Those three devices are expected to launch in February, prior to the MWC. Samsung did not confirm anything yet, but that will happen if Samsung ends up sticking to its release cycle.</p>

      <h3>The Galaxy S11 &amp; S11e may not ship with this new sensor</h3>
      <p>The Galaxy S11+ may differentiate in the camera department, compared to its siblings. We'll just have to wait and see what is Samsung planning, exactly.</p>
      <p>All three devices will be made out of metal and glass, and sport a centered display camera hole. We're expecting all three phones to feature a 20:9 display aspect ratio, and be quite slippery.</p>
      <p>Android 10 will come pre-installed on these devices, along with One UI 2. Leaks are claiming that all three will feature curved displays. More info will arrive in the coming weeks / months.</p>
