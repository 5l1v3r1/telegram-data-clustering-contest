      <h1>Alan Shearer makes emphatic title prediction after Man City lose to Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>City are 14 points off league leaders Liverpool following the weekend's results and their chances of retaining the title for a third season in a row look slim</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:25:42+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>BBC Sport pundit Alan Shearer believes Manchester City can kiss their chances of winning a third Premier League title in a row goodbye following their loss to rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>The 2-1 defeat was City's fourth Premier League loss of the season- already the same amount as they recorded during the last campaign- and left them a massive 14 points behind leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10510446/alan-shearer-exclusive-man-utd-city/">the Sun</a> , Shearer said he thinks City's title challenge is now effectively over.</p>
      <p>"I really can't see how <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> are going to get back into the title race now," Shearer said.</p>

      <p>"They are 14 points behind Liverpool and after the manner of their defeat to Manchester United I think that's it for them.</p>
      <p>"Jurgen Klopp's side have not lost in the league for 33 games, stretching back to January, so they would have to lose five of the remaining 22 for City to have a chance- and that's not going to happen."</p>
      <p>Shearer believes <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> are now the only team who can stop Liverpool winning their first top flight title since 1990 following the Foxes' 4-1 victory over Aston Villa- their eighth win in a row.</p>
      <p>"With City slipping up, it’s now up to Leicester to keep the pressure on in the title race," Shearer added.</p>
      <p>"It doesn’t look like the Foxes are going away after yesterday’s great win at Villa and if they can maintain their form through the Christmas period, they will be confident.</p>
      <p>"Especially as they host Liverpool on Boxing Day — a game that could end up being the defining one of the season."</p>

      <p>City Pep Guardiola appeared to accept defeat in the title race after their derby day loss when he said: "The reality is we’re 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially, the things we cannot control.</p>
      <p>"That’s the reality, but we have to continue. We’re at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play and other games to fight in."</p>
