      <p>“In previous years, you've seen the judges put individual singers in a group - usually with their decision making and reasoning off camera, but this time people will get to see the process take place.</p>
      <p>“The judges will select girls and boys to form new bands just like they did with One Direction and Little Mix and then both will go head to head to be crowned the winning group with a live arena finale in Birmingham.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>* The X Factor: The Band launches on ITV on Monday December 9 at 8.30pm and continues on Wednesday December 11 and Friday December 13, both at 8.30pm</b>
