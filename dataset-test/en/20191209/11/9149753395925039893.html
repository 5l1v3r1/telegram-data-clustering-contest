      <h1>This Red Dead Redemption 2 mod lets you spawn a flyable hot air balloon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:58:09+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/andy-kelly/" target="_blank">Andy Kelly</a></address>
      <p>I'm still waiting patiently for the day when the modding community figures out how to get airplanes and helicopters into Red Dead Redemption 2, but until then this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/76">hot air balloon mod</a> by Krank will have to do. Once installed you can conjure up a balloon wherever you are and fly it around freely, getting some amazing bird's eye views of Red Dead's sprawling slice of the Wild West.</p>
      <p>The balloon moves way faster than it realistically should. Don't expect to find an accurate simulation of a hot air balloon here. But it's a thrill being able to float around that massive world without being stuck on the back of a horse. The latest version of the mod added inertia and smoother controls, and it even has controller support if you're playing Red Dead with a gamepad.</p>

      <p>Installing the mod is as simple as dropping a file into your game directory. Just make sure you have <a href="http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/">Script Hook RDR2</a> otherwise it won't work. To spawn a balloon, hit F8 and you're ready to fly. And don't forget to check out our list of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-red-dead-redemption-2-rdr2-mods/">the best Red Dead Redemption 2 mods</a> for more ways to transform the game. Just don't go online with mods installed or you might get banned.</p>
