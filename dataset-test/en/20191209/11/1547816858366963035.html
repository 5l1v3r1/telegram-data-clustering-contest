        <b>Rashami Desai was extremely shocked to find out Arhaan Khan’s secrets during Bigg Boss 13 Weekend Ka Vaar with Salman Khan. Not just her, as per the poll results on SpotboyE, fans of the show too were shocked to know that he is already married and has a kid</b>
      </p>
      <p>The biggest shocker of Bigg Boss 13, hands down, has to be the big reveal about Arhaan Khan on Weekend Ka Vaar with Salman Khan. Arhaan had entered the BB house with the intention of proposing to Rashami Desai, and did so a few days ago. After they both confessed their feelings for each other, Rashami was over the moon and was even seen blushing when her friend Arti Singh talked about her plans to marry Arhaan. However, it all came crashing down when Salman revealed that Arhaan is not only married, but he also has a kid.</p>
      <p>While every contestant was startled and shocked to hear about this, Rashami was rendered speechless and also broke down later. Clearly, she did not see this coming, and she was deeply hurt and shocked to find out about it. Salman Khan also entered the BB house and was seen consoling Rashami. She said that she did not expect this from a person who supported her during the toughest of times, after which Salman hugged her. After the episode aired, SpotboyE.com held a poll for fans asking if they were just as shocked as Rashami to find out that Arhaan is married and has a kid. It was a clear majority as 71 percent of people voted for yes. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-asim-riaz-provokes-sidharth-shukla-sid-lies-down-on-the-floor-saying-sir-maaf-kardo-mereko/5dee15bffc4a991fc3877d9d">ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 13: Asim Riaz Provokes Sidharth Shukla; Sid Lies Down On The Floor Saying ‘Sir, Maaf Kardo Mereko’</a></p>
