      <p>A cyclist whose life was saved by good Samaritans when he suffered a cardiac arrest and 'died' for a moment has said a huge thank you.</p>
      <p>Alan Thompson was out riding his bike with his brother David in Smisby in June last year when he collapsed. David heard him making "grunting sounds" before he fell sideways off his bike and hit the ground.</p>
      <p>Luckily Laura Redfern and Nicola Abell, staff at a nearby nursery, saw what happened and rushed to Alan’s rescue. They started administering CPR while David called 999.</p>
      <p>Nicola also called her boss, Ian Higginbotham, who raced to the scene and took over with CPR so Laura could run to nearby Smisby Hall to fetch a vital defibrillator machine, which saved Alan’s life.</p>
      <p>Alan, who lives in Midway, told Burton Live: "I had actually stopped breathing and had died for a moment. <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/miracle-boy-who-open-heart-3612505">I'm so grateful to the passers-by of Smisby who saved my life.</a></p>
      <p>"It's thanks to them, their quick thinking and the easy access to the closest defibrillator that I could carry on being a husband, dad and granddad."</p>

      <p>As well as the nursery staff, others also helped Alan. Tony Louca-Weston, who was driving by when he saw what was happening, gave Alan mouth-to-mouth while Mike Cuming, who works as a pilot used the defibrillator to deliver a shock to Alan's heart, which ultimately saved his life.</p>
      <p>The shock from the machine interrupts the chaotic heart rhythm and allows the heart to return to a normal beating.</p>
      <p>Retired brewery worker Alan, who worked at Molson Coors for 42 years, said: "My life was saved by the prompt action of passers-by and the defibrillator which the village had installed on the outside of the village hall.</p>
      <p>"Following my <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/mum-autistic-boy-praises-teenagers-3601005">good fortune, I wanted to 'pay forward</a>' by funding a defibrillator in my community.</p>
      <p>"My daughter, Kate, immediately went into action raising money from a sponsored open water swim in Loch Lomond and we contacted Community Heartbeat Trust to start the process."</p>

      <p>Kate also made an application within her workplace at Yorkshire Building Society for a grant from their Charitable Trust and when it was approved, the family ordered a defibrillator for the Moira Furnace Museum Trust.</p>
      <p>Alan, said: "I would like to stress the importance of having more defibrillators, of knowing where your local ones are and also the importance of prompt action using CPR, within three minutes, and how this can mean the difference between life and death.</p>
      <p>"I am using this as a chance to encourage as many people as possible to learn CPR skills.</p>
      <p>"I have gone on to make a full recovery since having two stents inserted in my heart at the time, and one year on, I recently completed the Ride London 100 mile cycle event on behalf of the British Heart Foundation raising £2000 in sponsorship."</p>
      <p>On November 29, Alan, along with his daughter, wife and brother, attended free CPR training held at Moira Furnace, joined by volunteers, trustees and employees from businesses at the site.</p>
      <p>Afterwards the defibrillator, which will be situated at Moira Furnace Museum was officially launched and can now be used.</p>
