      <p>There's nothing more frustrating than trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network and something is playing up (OK, maybe setting up a printer is worse). In an effort to 'streamline and simplify' the operating system, Apple has buried the Wi-Fi diagnostic tools.<br/><br/>And if you don't know how to find the tools, you can't use them to help you.<br/><br/>Here's what you need to know!<br/><br/><b>Must read</b>: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ten-cool-and-useful-gadgets-that-make-great-last-minute-gifts-and-all-are-under-50/">Ten cool and useful gadgets that make great last-minute gifts, and all are under $50</a><br/><br/>First, how to access Wi-Fi diagnostics. This is not easy unless you know the magic incantation, which is to press down the OPTION key (⌥) while clicking on the Wi-Fi status menu.</p>

      <p>This will reveal a whole raft of new options, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable Wi-Fi Logging</li>
        <li>Create Diagnostics Report</li>
        <li>Open Wireless Diagnostics</li>
        <li>Wi-Fi Recommendations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You also get access to a whole lot of geeky information about the wireless connection, which depending on your technical aptitude, may or may not be useful.</p>
      <p><b>Must read</b>: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-may-dump-apple-in-2020-and-why-you-should-consider-it-too/">Why I may dump Apple in 2020… and why you should consider it too</a><br/><br/>However, before you go digging into Wi-Fi settings and getting hip-deep into things, I suggest you try to fix your Wi-Fi connection by doing the following first:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>See if another device will connect (is it an issue with the Mac or Wi-Fi network?)</li>
        <li>Reboot the Mac</li>
        <li>Disable any VPNs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hopefully, those simple things will help.</p>
