      <p>Workers were on site beginning the job, which is going to take a number of weeks to complete.</p>
      <p>Residents nearby have been warned to stay away from the area while it is still designated a live demolition site, as it may still be unsafe.</p>
      <p>It comes after the cooling towers were demolished last Friday.</p>
      <p>Crowds came out in force to watch as the four landmark cooling towers were blown down. It took about eight seconds from explosion to them having crumbled.</p>
      <p>It was a landmark moment in a demolition effort that will still take another 20 months to complete.</p>

      <p>Iain Thomson, of power station owners Harworth, said: "Clean-up will take a number of weeks. 24-hour security across the site remains in place and we want to remind all local residents that it is a live demolition site and should therefore stay well clear in the interests of safety."</p>
      <p>For the first time in 50 years, the cooling towers are no longer the dominant view on the Ironbridge Gorge eyeline.</p>
      <p>But a relatively small chimney nearby can still be spotted, and people have been questioning on social media when it might also be brought down.</p>
      <p>Mr Thomson said: "The site's chimney is likely to come down next year as part of the wider demolition programme."</p>

      <p>Before the demolition, there were a number of deer running around the area near the cooling towers.</p>
      <p>Rumours hit Twitter over the weekend that some had died in the blow down, although Harworth has confirmed that no wildlife were killed in the demolition.</p>

      <p>Mr Thomson said: "We can confirm that no deer or other wildlife were harmed during or in the aftermath of the demolition of the cooling towers."</p>
      <p>The masterplan for the site is expected to be submitted to both Shropshire Council and Telford &amp; Wrekin Council before Christmas, and could take about a year to be approved.</p>
      <p>It is expected to include up to 1,000 homes, as well as businesses and a railway line.</p>
