      <h1>K. Michelle Gets Vulnerable In New Photo Where She Shows Off Her Post-Surgery Body And Speaks About The Healing Process</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:12:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Fisher</a></address>
      <p>It looks like K. Michelle is back on track to being healthy and happy, and she is now entirely comfortable in her body — or at least, more than she has ever been in the past, judging from what the public could tell.</p>
      <p>The “I Just Can’t Do This” singer has been talking a lot about her path to recovery over the last year, after deciding to stop getting injections to make her rear bigger and removing her hazardous implants.</p>
      <p>Some of Michelle’s fans were initially worried about the safety of the procedure, but in the end, the star made it clear that her mind was made up, and she was not going to back down from her decision.</p>
      <p>Currently, she is reportedly happier than ever and does not regret what she has done one bit.</p>
      <p>In fact, some reports from people allegedly close to her indicate that she is considering this to be one of the best decisions she has made for her appearance, and she had no regrets about it at all.</p>

      <p>The R&amp;B singer shared a photo of her healing body and explained: “This body of mine has been through hell! It isn’t perfect, but it’s MY body. This journey has been difficult, but I’m a tough cookie. Proud of myself, and that’s all that matters! Finishing up my reconstruction with @drcarlosgomez1, I’ll see you in Jan. Also, I’m excited about my new tv show helping women like me remove silicon from their bodies! Powerful and how I want to spend my 2020, saving some people’s life.🙏”</p>

      <p>Another commenter shared: “YES, GO, K!! I saw you tonight at The Mayan in LA!! You looked gorgeous, and the whole show was lit and beautiful! I’m one of your greatest Asian Vietnamese fans in LA! Thank you for reposting my singing video of “Can’t Raise a Man” a couple of weeks back! I was so stoked to get to see you front row at your concert! I hope you saw me, and I think you did… Anywho! I support you, and thank you for all your amazing music!!! 💖💖💖”</p>

      <p>Michelle was adamant that this was not the case at all, and she had no intention of misleading anyone with regards to how she looked.</p>
      <p>She seems quite determined to make a statement with her body, so that does seem to tie in with her attitude overall.</p>
