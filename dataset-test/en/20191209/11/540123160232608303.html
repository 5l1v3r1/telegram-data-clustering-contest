      <h1>Terror Roundup: Two Separate Stabbing Attempts in Hebron</h1>

      <blockquote>The angel of Hashem said to her further, “Behold, you are with child And shall bear a son; You shall call him Ishmael, For Hashem has paid heed to your suffering. He shall be a wild ass of a man; His hand against everyone, And everyone’s hand against him; He shall dwell alongside of all his kinsmen.”<cite><a href="http://theisraelbible.com/bible/genesis/chapter-16/#verse-16">Genesis 16 11-12 (The Israel Bible™)</a></cite></blockquote>
      <p>Two separate attempted stabbings took place yesterday in the ancient city of Hebron. At 8:00 AM on Sunday, a female terrorist wielded a knife and a screwdriver at border police yelling “you deserve to die!”. She was immediately subdued and arrested.</p>
      <p>Later that same day at 5:30 PM, another terrorist drew a knife at, again, the border police outside the Tomb of the Patriarchs and was also subdued and arrested.</p>
      <p>Other terror-related incidents that took place in Israel yesterday included a rabbi who was pulled out of his vehicle and beaten by Arabs in front of his kids in the central city of Lod.</p>
      <p>Plus, 5 terrorists were arrested for illegal possession of firearms.</p>
      <p>Rocks were thrown by Arabs at Israeli vehicles on highway 443, at a bus near Hawara in Samaria, near Sinjil which is north of Ramallah, Mount Hebron (broken windshield), and on the Gush Etzion-Jerusalem road in the Judean region.</p>
