        <b>Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae has been brought to hospital following a fire in his shop.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The blaze is believed to have broken out around the fuse board of the filling station in Kilgarvan this morning.</p>
      <p>The fire services were notified just before 9am, and one unit attended.</p>
      <p>Danny Healy-Rae told <i>Radio Kerry</i> his brother is fine, but has gone to hospital as a precaution.</p>
      <p>He says Michael extinguished the fire and inhaled smoke in the process.</p>
      <p>Deputy Healy-Rae explained: "He's fine, but it was decided he should go for an x-ray to check himself out.</p>
      <p>"It was a shock, because it was a bit scary for a few minutes until [the fire] was brought under control."</p>
