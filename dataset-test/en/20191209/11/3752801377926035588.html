      <p>Kigali â€“ Rwanda on Sunday started a voluntary Ebola vaccination programme at its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in a bid to prevent the spread of the deadly virus from its neighbour.</p>
      <p>All countries in high-risk areas, even if not hit by Ebola, had been advised by the WHO to use a new vaccine developed by US group Johnson &amp; Johnson, the country's health minister, Diane Gashumba, told journalists.</p>
      <p>The idea was "to protect those with high chances of getting in contact with people living in areas where Ebola has been reported to be active", she said.</p>
      <p>The vaccine, Ad26-ZEBOV-GP, is an experimental drug produced by US pharmaceuticals giant, Johnson &amp; Johnson. It was used for the first time in mid-November in Goma in DR Congo, on the other side of the border.</p>
      <p>So far, there have been no confirmed cases of Ebola in Rwanda.</p>
      <p>The epicentre of the outbreak in DR Congo, which has killed more than 2 200 people since August 2018, is located 350km north of Goma, in the Beni-Butembo region.</p>
      <p>That region sits on the DR Congo border with Uganda.</p>
      <p>More than 250 000 people in DR Congo have already been vaccinated using another product, rVSV-ZEBOV, made by US drug company, Merck Shape and Dohme.</p>

      </p>
      <p>People working in the health sector, at border crossings, police officers, and business executives who frequently travel between the two countries are being given priority in the vaccination campaign.</p>
      <p>But all residents in the border districts can ask to be vaccinated if they wish.</p>
      <p>The first volunteers expressed relief at the measure.</p>
      <p>"We lived in a life of worry because of what was going on in DR Congo," Joel Ntwari Murihe, one of the first Rwandans to be vaccinated, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"It caused a lot of border disruptions as we were restricted to buying or selling with DR Congo residents who live in Goma.</p>
      <p>"The vaccine is an assurance to the safety for our lives and our children's lives."</p>
      <p>The head of DR Congo's anti-Ebola efforts, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, and the WHO's representative in Rwanda, Kasonde Mwinga, were present at the campaign launch.</p>
      <p>In August, Rwanda briefly closed its border with DR Congo and ordered its citizens not to visit the country when the first Ebola cases were recorded in Goma.</p>
      <p>The city, which is the regional capital of the Congolese province of North Kivu, sits on the border with Rwanda.</p>
      <p>The border has since been reopened, but strict medical checks are being enforced.</p>
