      <h1>Rock collapse at gold mine in South Africa kills four workers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:21:11+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mining-technology.com/author/ghimaja/" target="_blank">Himaja</a></address>
      <p>A rockfall at the Village Main Reef’s Tau Lekoa gold mine in Orkney, North West province of South Africa, has claimed the lives of four workers.</p>
      <p>It was reported that one mineworker survived the incident and is in a serious but stable condition as he was rescued soon after the rockfall at the mine.</p>
      <p>The seismic incident followed at least one earth tremor, reported Reuters.</p>
      <p>The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said in a statement that ‘there was no escape route in the working area where the four mineworkers were found dead’.</p>
      <p>NUM further added that Tau Lekoa gold mine’s proto team, which includes a group of trained workers to perform underground rescues, did not act spontaneously to save the four miners.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the team had intentionally stopped the team leaders and winch drivers from rescuing the four mineworkers, the union said.</p>
      <p>The news agency cited Tau Lekoa mine spokesman James Duncan as saying: “There were two seismic events and then a rockfall occurred.</p>
      <p>“Investigations on the causal factors are ongoing and we will be able to comment only once those are complete. We won’t be commenting at all on the accusations by NUM.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Village Main Reef declined to comment on the evacuation procedures until the completion of an investigation.</p>
      <p>The Congress of SA Trade Unions (COSATU) was quoted by African News Agency as saying: “COSATU and National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) leadership have been observing efforts by the rescue team to recover bodies.”</p>
      <p>According to the March estimates of the Mineral Resources Ministry in South Africa, the death toll in the country has fallen to 81 fatalities last year from 90 in 2017.</p>
