      <h2>Figures show 53% of bloc’s plane imports last year went to Ireland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:55:29+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/eoin-burke-kennedy-7.1837462" target="_blank">Eoin Burke-Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>Ireland ranked as the largest importer of planes in the EU last year, accounting for more than 50 per cent of the total.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Eurostat">Eurostat</a> figures show EU member states imported 533 large planes from non-EU countries in 2018, worth €21.9 billion.</p>
      <p>A total of 284 (53 per cent) were imported by Ireland, unscoring the State’s status as a global hub for aircraft leasing.</p>

      <p>The figures made Ireland by far the largest EU importer of large planes from the rest of the world, ahead of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Poland">Poland</a> (37 large planes; 7 per cent of total extra-EU imports of large planes), the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=United+Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (34; 6 per cent ) and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Germany">Germany</a> (32; 6 per cent), Eurostat said.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Central+Statistics+Office">Central Statistics Office</a> (CSO), there were approximately 4,000 commercial aircraft leased through companies here last year, representing a total value of $115 billion.</p>
      <p>Recent changes to accounting conventions mean the purchases of aircraft are included as imports in the national accounts compiled by the CSO.</p>
      <p>The Eurostat figures indicate almost two thirds of large planes’ imports from non-EU countries came from the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=United+States">United States</a> (329 large planes, or 62 per cent of extra-EU imports of large planes).</p>
      <p>On the export side, EU member states exported 963 large planes, worth €47.7 billion, outside of the EU in 2018. The number of exported large planes to non-EU countries increased by 27 per cent compared with 2013.</p>
