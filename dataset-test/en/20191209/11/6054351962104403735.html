      <p>As rapper Tron noted in the comment section, “Our generation is going faster than any .. please let’s help each other no more drugs.” Over the past two years, drug overdoses have led to the deaths of <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48353/title.mac-miller-dead-at-26">Mac Miller</a> and <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.3930/title.who-exactly-was-lil-peep">Lil Peep</a> — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
      <p>Juice was only 21 at the time of his death, having just celebrated his birthday on December 2. The Chicago native had long struggled with opiate addiction and admitted he was <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52042/title.juice-wrld-swears-off-lean-for-good">struggling with lean. </a></p>
      <p>In a July tweet to his then-girlfriend Ally Lotti, he wrote, “Bae I’m sorry I be tweaking, you’ve put up with more than ppl know I know I be scaring you, fuck Codeine I’m done. I love you and im letting it be known publicly that ain’t shit fucking up the real love I found. Learn from this everyone. Addiction kills all but you can overcome.”</p>
      <p>The Cook County Medical Examiner is expected to do an autopsy on Monday (December 9) to confirm his cause of death.</p>
