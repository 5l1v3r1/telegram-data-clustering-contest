      <p>STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish district court on Monday acquitted Finnish paper firm Stora Enso of responsibility for causing Sweden’s largest wildfire in 40 years, instead fining a subcontractor.</p>
      <p>The district court of the Vastmanland region, where the wildfire occurred, said no criminal liability could be placed on Stora Enso, only on the subcontractor, a small forestry company.</p>
      <p>The wildfire, which was declared a national emergency and forced over 1,000 people to evacuate their homes, had begun during ground works carried out by the contractor, the court said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The subcontractor was fined 2.5 million Swedish crowns ($260,000).</p>
      <p>One person was killed when the wildfire ravaged an area totaling 14,000 hectares in the central Vastmanland region in 2014.</p>
      <p>Stora Enso is one of the largest global pulp, paper and packaging board makers with roughly 26,000 employees in over 300 countries.</p>
