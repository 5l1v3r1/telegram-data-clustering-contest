        <b>RUSSIA have been handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events - but will still deny Scotland an automatic place at Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>We told you last month how the world's largest nation <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4972580/russia-euro-2020-ban-doping-scotland/">faced being suspended from the competition</a> due to alleged inconsistencies in anti-doping data.</p>

      <p>And the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) have today confirmed that Russia will not be allowed to officially compete at major events.</p>
      <p>It means the Russian flag and anthem will not be allowed at next year's Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
      <p>And the football team will not be allowed to play at all at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>They can still appeal WADA's decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland in a bid to reverse it.</p>

      <p>However, Russia <b>WILL</b> be able to play at Euro 2020 as Uefa is not considered a major event organisation in regards to anti-doping breaches.</p>
      <p>St Petersburg will also remain a host city during next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>It means that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> will not take Russia's automatic place in the competition.</p>
      <p>Steve Clarke's men finished third in their qualifying group behind the Russians and Belgium.</p>
      <p>The national side will instead try to qualify for Euro 2020 via the play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>Scotland earned the opportunity by winning their Nations League group in the first half of last season.</p>
      <p>Our players have been drawn against Israel in the play-off semi-final and will face them at Hampden on March 26 next year.</p>
      <p>Should they win that game, they will then take on the winner of the tie between Norway and Serbia away from home on March 31.</p>
