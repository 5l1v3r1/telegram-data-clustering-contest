      <p>A San Antonio man has been arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend and carving his name on her forehead with a knife.</p>
      <p>Jackub Hildreth, 19, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after his girlfriend, 22-year-old Catalina Mireles, accused him of attacking her, according to police.</p>
      <p>Mireles said the pair met on Facebook about four weeks ahead of the horrific attack, which left her with a broken jaw, a black eye and extreme swelling and bruising on her face.</p>
      <p>She said the attack started on Thursday morning and lasted until the afternoon. The altercation started over an argument about their relationship.</p>
      <p>The young woman said she thought Hildreth was going to kill her.</p>
      <p>"He was going to put me in the closet until he figured out what he was going to do with my body," Mireles told ABC affiliate KSAT in an on-camera interview on Saturday. "Don't trust everybody you think you might know."</p>
      <p>Hildreth previously was wanted for burglary assault, court records show.</p>
      <p>He was being held on $75,000 bond as of Sunday evening and is scheduled to appear in court next month.</p>
