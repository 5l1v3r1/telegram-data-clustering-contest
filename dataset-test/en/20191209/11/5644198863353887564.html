      <p>MOUNT HUTT: Almost 1,000 tourists were stranded in New Zealand's South Island on Monday (Dec 9) after wild storms cut highways, washed away bridges and flooded the rugged landscape.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists said up to 400mm of rain was dumped on the South Island over 24 hours by a severe weather system that unleashed gale-force winds and 230,000 lightning strikes.</p>

      <p>The main highway through the island was closed after the Rangitata river burst its banks. Townships near the popular Franz Josef glacier were isolated when landslips blocked road access.</p>

      <p>With New Zealand entering its peak tourist season, some 970 travellers at Franz Josef were left facing the prospect of taking an expensive helicopter ride to get out or hunkering down until Friday, when the road is expected to be cleared.</p>

      <p>"Between the community, the hotels and motels and our welfare centre we've managed to billet out most people overnight," Civil Defence spokesman Stephen Doran told TVNZ.</p>
      <p>"We'd just ask people to stay put at the moment. We want to keep the work site clear so we can get supplies in there... and try to get the road into some sort of shape."</p>
      <p>Another landslip on the island's west coast will take an estimated six weeks to clear.</p>
      <p>The worst of the weather hit over the weekend and it is forecast to deteriorate again later in the week, leaving authorities scrambling during a brief respite to complete as much repair work as possible.</p>
