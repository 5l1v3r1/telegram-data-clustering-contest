      <h1>Russia: CBR prepping to cut another 50bps – TDS</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:19:43+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/sandeep-kanihama" target="_blank">Sandeep Kanihama</a></address>
      <p>Analysts at TD Securities are expecting the CBR to cut the Key Rate by another 50bps to 6.00% on Friday.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“The consensus is less dovish and expects 25bps of easing, which is also quite a likely scenario. In this latter case, we would consider further easing in 2020 more likely than a hold as we currently forecast (premised on 50bps of easing this week).”</p>
      <p>“FX: If the CBR eases by 50bps, as we expect, we anticipate a very limited rally in USDRUB only. Modest downside-to-no reaction if the CBR cuts 25bps. Expect somewhat stronger downside move in USDRUB in the very unlikely event of a hold.”</p>
