      <p>Announcing the funding today, Minister Ring said: “Social Enterprises are providing valuable services and supports in communities across Ireland.</p>
      <p>"To assist them in their work, I announced the Small Capital Grants Scheme in October.</p>
      <p>"We received an overwhelming response to this call for funding from social enterprises in Mayo and across the country.</p>
      <p>“These grants of between €2,000 and €15,000 which are being awarded will help these enterprises to achieve their social, environmental and economic objectives.</p>
      <p>“This funding is being provided from the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is managed by my department.</p>
      <p>"Examples of items being supported through the Small Capital Grants scheme include the purchase of new kitchen equipment, computers, training material, and minor refurbishments.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately it was not possible to fund more of the social enterprises that applied this year, given the budget available, but I will review the possibility of making further allocations in 2020.</p>
      <p>"I also intend to make an announcement very shortly on funding for Training and Mentoring for Social Enterprises.”</p>
