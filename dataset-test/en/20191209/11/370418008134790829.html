      <p>It’s the rock’n’roll rumour train that keeps on rolling – are <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/ac-dc/">AC/DC</a> recording a new album with Phil Rudd and Brian Johnson?</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, famed rock DJ <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/ac-dc-will-absolutely-tour-again-with-brian-johnson/">Eddie Trunk claimed</a> that AC/DC “are absolutely going to tour with Brian back again” according to his sources. The band’s engineer <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/ac-dc-have-been-in-the-studio-doing-something/">Mike Fraser also said</a> that the band have been in the studio “doing something.”</p>
      <p>Now the stories are coming thick and fast from former <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/twisted-sister/">Twisted Sister</a> frontman Dee Snider, who has revealed that the reunion is on for next year – with a new album!</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/deesnider/status/1202958910191222785">Posting on Twitter</a> this weekend, in response to a fan about his choice of Super Bowl half-time entertainment, Dee said: “I’m focused on one band for the 2021 Superbowl half time show: AC/DC! Reuniting with new album next year, touring, celebrating 50 years together!”</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/deesnider/status/1203416499295326208">went on to say</a> that AC/DC were back with drummer Phil Rudd and bassist Cliff Williams were back in the fold, and that Brian’s hearing is “good.” Vocalist Brian Johnson was forced to retire from his position in 2016 due to problems with his hearing, but at the start of this year, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/apparently-brian-johnson-is-back-in-ac-dc-for-a-new-album/">reports emerged that he was back in action</a>.</p>
      <p>But perhaps the most striking comment from Dee on the rumoured reunion is that late guitarist Malcolm Young will feature on the album.</p>
      <p>“All four surviving members have reunited WITH tracks recorded by Malcolm while he was still alive,” <a href="https://twitter.com/deesnider/status/1203349266242134016">said Dee on Twitter</a>. “Malcolm’s nephew Stevie Young is replacing him (he’s done this a couple of times before). It’s as close as you can get to the original band.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>There has been no official word on the supposed reunion from AC/DC, but with so many bands reforming in the past six months, would it really be that much of a surprise to see the hard rock legends back at it again?</p>
