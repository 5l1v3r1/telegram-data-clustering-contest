      <p>They were arrested in an office on the second floor of a nightclub in July after police found 1.12 grams of cocaine in Mr Cabantog's pocket. Urine tests taken from the pair tested positive to cocaine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53eoa.html">An earlier trial held in Denpasar District court in Bali</a> on November 27, heard from three witnesses, including arresting officer Putu Eka Wibawa.</p>
      <p>Putu said police had found the cocaine in Cabantog's jeans pocket and that he had purchased it for about 3 million Rupiah ($300). "We found traces on the table, of the role of cash they used to use the cocaine."</p>
      <p>The charges the pair will ultimately face will be decided later, during the sentencing demands after the defence and prosecution have made their case.</p>
      <p>The cocaine possession charge carries a maximum penalty of 12 years for less than five grams of the category 1 narcotic, while the lesser charge carries a maximum penalty of four years in jail.</p>
      <p>Mr Van Iersel told Monday's hearing that he used cocaine as a stimulant after working long hours and he had moved to Bali to stop using drugs.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know that William came carrying the coccaine. He offered. If I don't use cocaine I get tired, more irritable, panic. The alternative, it's just not the same," he told the court.</p>
      <p>GP and counselor Dr Ririn Wijayanti told the court that he recommended Mr Van Iersel be sent to rehabilitation for six months.</p>
      <p>"David used drugs when he was 18, since high school, offered by a friend in a party. He started using again after he started working because by then he can afford it. Up to five times a week. He scored five on the addiction level, highly addicted," Dr Wijayanti told the court.</p>
      <p>He said Mr Cabantog also scored high on the addiction level.</p>
      <p>"William started using drugs when he was 15, he used marijuana. His cousin overdosed on cocaine and William started to have depression," he said.</p>
      <p>"He once tried to commit suicide, after he injured his knee, making him unable to play basketball, he was an athlete. Because of the attempted suicide, I referred him to a psychiatrist to have his mental condition reviewed."</p>

      <p>Psychiatrist Dr Nyoman Pande Sura Oka told the court that Mr Cabantog came from a "broken family".</p>
      <p>"His father was an alcoholic, who abused him when he was drunk. He was very close to his cousin who was a drug addict. So he also used drugs to be close to him."</p>
      <p>Head judge Heriyanti said: "The doctor is recommending you for a rehabilitation. You said that you came to Bali to stay away from drugs, because Bali (Indonesia) is strict with drugs. But you were caught using, why should we consider rehabilitation for you if there's no intention from you?"</p>
      <p>Mr Cabatong said he also came to Bali "clean and sober".</p>
      <p>"I tried to stay clean by coming to Bali. But the work that I came for fell through, so I had to find an alternative to support myself," he told the court.</p>
      <p>"I was on an anti depressant for 10 years before using cocaine. I find it works faster. I've only started using coccaine in the last five years. I suffer PTSD, anxiety, depression.</p>
      <p>"I dont have a criminal record in Australia. I went to rehab in Australia for my addiction for six months, that was the only time."</p>
      <p>The court adjourned to next Monday, December 17 for the prosecutor, Citra Maya Sari, to present the sentence demand.</p>
