      <h1>Central Java students take to streets to mark International Anticorruption Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:34:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:34</time> by <a rel="author">Suherdjoko</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of students in Central Java took to the streets to declare support for the country’s anticorruption efforts during Car Free Day on Jl. Pahlawan in the provincial capital of Semarang on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The rally, which took place in front of the Central Java provincial office building, was held to commemorate International Anticorruption Day, which falls every Dec. 9.</p>
      <p>Around 3,000 students from various schools in Central Java took part in the rally, during which students carried posters emblazoned with words of protest, such as “<i>Cukup Atiku Sing Ambyar, Negoroku Ojo"</i> (It’s enough that my heart is broken, don’t make my country become so) in the Javanese language and "<i>Mending Ketemu Tikus Tanah, Dibanding Tikus Berdasi” </i>(better to encounter a rat on land rather than a white collar rat).</p>
      <p>Students also stuck anticorruption stickers inscribed with Javanese words <i>"Nek aku korupsi, ora slamet"</i> (If I commit corruption, I would not be safe) on several official cars.</p>
      <p>Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo, who attended the event and wore a red and white headband and white T-shirt emblazoned with the words <i>"Mboten Korupsi, Mboten Ngapusi" </i>(no corruption, no lying) in Javanese, asked protesters to take the stage for speeches.</p>
      <p>“As a young generation, let us endeavor to realize an Indonesia and Central Java that is free from corruption. We are still young but our souls and spirits are burning!” Intan Latifah, a protester from SMA 1 Purwanegara state senior high school in Banjarnegara, said in her speech.</p>
      <p>Another student, M. Aji Kurniawan from SMK Pati state vocational high school, said, “If civil servants commit corruption, do not let them through the office door! [shoot] them. Corrupt people must be sentenced to death."</p>
      <p>During the rally, Ganjar said youths should adopt good values in their daily life, such as being disciplined, refrain from cheating and lying.</p>
      <p>“Teachers should guide [students],” he said. “School principals and teachers are the ones responsible for school management. The students are watching you.” (sau)</p>
