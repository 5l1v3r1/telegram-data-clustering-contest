        <b>Heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, has relished the challenge of fighting Deontay Wilder and <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1262805-tyson-fury--career-highlights-wife-mental-health-net-worth.html">Tyson Fury</a> after his victory over Andy Ruiz.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joshua defeated the Mexican star on Saturday, December 7, in Saudi Arabia in an epoch-making bout that saw the Brit put in blood and breath to reclaim his heavyweight belts.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old star was immediately ordered to face WBO challenger, Oleksandr Usyk within 180 days or risk losing his belt.</p>
      <p>But Joshua, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1282599-anthony-joshua-heavyweight-star-allays-fear-fighting-oleksandr-usyk.html">who earlier welcomed the challenge of fighting the Ukrainian</a>, seems to be keen on possible fight with American star or his countryman.</p>

      <p>Asked on dream fight with Wilder or Fury, the British boxer allayed fear of facing his arch rivals in the division, saying he is not a "running champion."</p>
      <p><i>"I would love to make that my next fight. I'm taking it one step at a time. Whenever they are ready they know where to find us,"</i> Joshua said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported that<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1282693-anthony-joshua-lost-fight-andy-ruiz-health-issues.html"> Anthony Joshua has claimed that health issues contributed to his first ever</a> defeat in boxing which came against Andy Ruiz in New York.</p>
      <p>Andy Ruiz taught Anthony Joshua some boxing lesson six months ago in a result that shocked many followers and lovers of the game.</p>
      <p>But after the defeat in America, Anthony Joshua offered Andy Ruiz a rematch which was agreed by the Mexican-American and they met in Saudi Arabia on December 7.</p>
