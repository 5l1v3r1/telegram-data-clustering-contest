      <p><b>NAIROBI, KenyaÂ (AP)</b> - The flamboyant governor of Kenya's capital city, Nairobi, has been charged with 19 counts of graft-related charges as the country struggles to tackle runaway corruption.</p>
      <p>Mike Gideon Mbuvi, widely known as Mike Sonko, Monday denied the charges including embezzlement and money laundering. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission alleges Mbuvi awarded contracts to friend's companies, which after receiving payment, wired to Mbuvi's accounts Kenyan shillings worth thousands of dollars.</p>
      <p>Mbuvi is known for controversy and his flamboyant lifestyle, like wearing gold rings, chains, watches and clothes. He prefers being called "Sonko" which means rich man in Kenya's Sheng slang.</p>
      <p>A heavy police presence was deployed in the capital ahead of his court appearance after police said there was information that his supporters were planning demonstrations</p>
