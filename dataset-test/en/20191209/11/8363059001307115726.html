      <h1>God Takes Blame for Attacking Brexit Party Advert in Doncaster</h1>

      <p>Political activists in Doncaster are all off the hook today, after police decided that a mobile Brexit Party banner had not been rammed off the road by an angry local as initially claimed. Blame for the incident has now been placed on the wind.</p>
      <p>This comes via local radicalist news source the <a href="https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/police-state-brexit-party-trailer-was-blown-over-wind-after-candidate-claims-it-was-run-road-1334515">Doncaster Free Press</a>, which says South Yorkshire Police ruled against a claim made by Doncaster North Brexit Party candidate Andy Stewart, who <a href="https://twitter.com/BrexitDoncNorth/status/1202717377101729794">said</a> the banner – proudly being displayed on a trailer towed by another BP candidate – was rammed off the road while on the move.</p>
      <p>South Yorks Police counteracted this dramatised-for-Twitter version of events with the calm explanation of: "A car, which was being driven by a General Election candidate, was towing an advertising trailer which tipped over and caused the car to swerve. It is believed the weather conditions played a factor in this incident due to the high winds last night."</p>
      <p>And no injuries were reported, despite Stewart's claim that the car driver was hospitalised. What this country needs is Kim Jong-un to take over and shut everyone up when they even dare to <i>think</i> about politics.
