        <b>Alex Neil thinks Preston North End have been unlucky with their current crop of injuries rather than there being one obvious cause.</b>

      <p>The Lilywhites face Fulham on Tuesday night having lost their previous four matches, injuries hitting the squad hard in the last three of those.</p>

      <p>At Queens Park Rangers last Saturday, defenders Patrick Bauer, Ben Davies and Darnell Fisher were missing, together with midfield pair Paul Gallagher and Daniel Johnson.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Springfields on Monday morning to look ahead to Fulham's visit to Deepdale, PNE manager Neil said: "We spoke at the start of the season about wanting to keep as many players fit as we can, that gives up better options, strength in numbers.</p>
      <p>"When you lose a number of players, particularly in similar positions - we've lost two centre-backs and two technical midfield players - it can do a bit of damage because they are the building blocks to how we play."</p>
      <p>At the end of last season, Neil commissioned an outside audit to assess all aspects of fitness and injuries at the club, that on the back of being hit with a couple of injury pile-ups at different stages of the campaign.</p>

      <p>Neil points out that many of the current injuries are short-term ones rather than anything too lengthy and the amount of hamstring strains have reduced from last year.</p>
      <p>"This season has been different to others by the fact it has been niggly ones rather than longer-term injuries which are the issue," said Neil.</p>
      <p>"We had a lot of hamstrings before and that has settled down this season.</p>
      <p>"A lot of the injuries we've had have been contact injuries, off the top of my head almost every injury we've had have been in games rather than happening in training.</p>
      <p>"We have come down off them a little bit this season, we don't train for as long as we did before.</p>
      <p>"Teams pick up injuries all the time, we have just been unfortunate they have come in the same areas of the team. That has hurt us."</p>
      <p>Neil revealed Gallagher's injury which has kept him out of the last two games is an issue with his Achilles tendon.</p>
      <p>Whether he is back in time to face Fulham, remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Neil said: Gally's Achilles has been playing up a little bit. He had a jab in it the other day just to settle it down.</p>
      <p>"It is one of those, how long is a piece of string?</p>
      <p>"He could be fine in two or three days or it could be next week. It is when that pain dissipates and Gally feels he can move about the pitch freely."</p>
