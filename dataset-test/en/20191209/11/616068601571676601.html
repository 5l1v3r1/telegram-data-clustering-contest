      <p>Alleged quadruple murderer John Brittain appeared briefly in Penticton court Monday morning, waiving his right to a previously-scheduled preliminary inquiry and announcing his intention to proceed straight to a jury trial in B.C. Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>Brittain’s lawyer, Paul McMurray, did most of the speaking, with his client appearing via video conference from Okanagan Correctional Centre.</p>
      <p>A preliminary inquiry puts the facts of a case before a judge to ensure the Crown has enough evidence to proceed to trial. It also allows the defence to explore the case.</p>
      <p>McMurray, however, said Monday they were consenting to the trial and would elect to B.C. Supreme Court for a judge and jury trial.</p>
      <p>Brittain is accused of shooting and killing Susan and Barry Wonch, Rudi Winter and Darlene Knippelberg on April 15. Police say he turned himself in after the spree.</p>
      <p>The court also renewed a no-contact order between John and his ex-wife Katherine Brittain, who the Crown says may be called to testify at the trial. </p>
      <p>All of the victims were neighbours of Katherine Brittain, who was reportedly in a protracted neighbours dispute with many of them. The son-in-law of Winter, Zachary Charles Steele, was <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/271955/brittain-vandal-sentenced">sentenced to probation last week</a> for throwing a rock through the window of Katherine Brittain’s home two months after the shooting.</p>
      <p>John Brittain will be back in court January 27, 2020 to determine a trial date.</p>
