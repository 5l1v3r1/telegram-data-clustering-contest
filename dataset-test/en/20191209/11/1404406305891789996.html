      <p>Update 12/09/2019 10:42am:</p>
      <p>People that were on the plane with Juice Wrld prior to landing in Chicago, where he suffered a seizure and <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259430/juice-wrld-dead-at-21-seizure-at-chicago-airport">later died</a>, say that he was taking pills during the flight. An associate of the "Lucid Dreams" rapper told TMZ that he has a Percocet problem.</p>
      <p>In addition, the FBI seized 70 pounds of marijuana on the private jet, which was stored in luggage, and they also found a bottle of codeine inside. Back in July, Juice Wrld wrote on Twitter about wanting to quit Lean after scaring his girlfriend, "Bae I’m sorry I be tweaking, you’ve put up with more than ppl know I know I be scaring you, f**k Codeine I’m done. I love you and im letting it be known publicly that ain’t shit f**king up the real love I found. Learn from this everyone. Addiction kills all but you can overcome."  </p>
      <p>Police also found three guns on the plane, leading to the arrest of Chris Long and Henry Dean. Dean was released without bail, while Long was released after posting $1,500 bail. </p>
      <p>The Cook County Medical Examiner is expected to conduct an autopsy on Monday (December 8) to determine a cause of death for Juice Wrld. </p>
