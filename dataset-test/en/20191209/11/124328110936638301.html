      <p>A horrified resident tackled actors pretending to rob a store in Dorset during filming for a new indie horror film. </p>
      <p>As the director shouted 'action' the actors, dressed as robbers, charged into the shop in Winfrith Newburgh, but a resident believed the scenes were real and ran in front of cameras to stop the 'raid'. </p>
      <p>Producers of the film 'Perran' had chosen the village to shoot some of the action scenes. </p>

      <p>John Capel, a spokesman for the production company Hard Road Films, said: 'A member of the public attempted to chase the gang after they left the scene.' </p>
      <p>'A camera had been hidden in the 'getaway' vehicle parked outside the shop so it wasn't really visible to the general public.</p>
      <p>'When the gang left the shop, chased by a very irate shopkeeper, it looked just like a real robbery - so much so that a passing member of the public decided that he should try and help.</p>
      <p>'Fortunately, the director, Rad Brown, was on hand to reassure the brave man that they were just making a film.'</p>

      <p>'It is obviously a very special place to live, in fact we were overwhelmed by the hospitality and co-operation afforded to us by the local community during our stay in the village.</p>
      <p>'We would publicly like to extend our thanks to everyone for their patience and sincerely apologise to those that may have been inconvenienced by our arrival.'</p>
      <p>He said that 'due to the nature of the scenes', the production company had pre-warned the police and approached all the households in the vicinity to let them know in advance. </p>
      <p>Jonathan Moore, the owner of Winfrith Village Stores where the 'robbery' was staged, said: 'We were delighted to have had the opportunity to support the UK film industry and we had a lot of fun watching the all-too-realistic action take place in our shop.'</p>
      <p>Perran, scheduled for release early next year, stars Willie Coppen, who previously appeared in 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi' and 'Willow'.</p>
