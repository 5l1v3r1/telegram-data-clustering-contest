      <h1>Mum with scratched up skin says this is what anxiety looks like</h1>

      <p>Anxiety can be a debilitating condition and it looks different for everyone.</p>
      <p>For one mum, Caitlin Fldager, it means picking at her skin until it starts breaking and leaving marks on her body.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two from Vancouver, Canada, has been open with her mental health in the past and posted a happy family photo days before trying to take her life.</p>
      <p>Now the mummy blogger has revealed how her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anxiety/">anxiety</a> manifests physically and stops her from being in public places without looking for the nearest exit.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10212810691342318&amp;set=a.2970837410192&amp;type=3&amp;theater">wrote on her Facebook</a>: ‘I have had people tell me “anxiety isn’t as bad as you make it out to be, it’s just in your head”.</p>
      <p>‘So, I want to show you what anxiety looks like, on the outside. My raw, scratched up face and chest. The sores I pick at until they bleed.</p>
      <p>‘This is anxiety. Anxiety isn’t just feeling nervous. It’s picking your skin raw. It’s not just feeling worried, or feeling your heart race.’</p>
      <p>Her post resonated with thousands, many of whom hadn’t realised that their similar conditions such as picking at their skin may also be a result of undiagnosed anxiety.</p>

      <p>Caitlin told Metro.co.uk that she has ways to deal with the effects of anxiety, though there is no straight-up cure.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I smoke weed, I talk to a therapist, and I take medication.</p>
      <p>‘I wanted to share this image of myself because it needs to be talked about way more.</p>
      <p>‘I just want to help others feel less alone.’</p>
      <p>In the past, Caitlin has been criticised for saying she thinks smoking marijuana has made her a better mum.</p>
      <p>Caitlin argued that smoking recreational drugs after the kids have gone to sleep was no different than a glass of wine at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>Where she lives, weed is legal but her followers still <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/mum-says-smoking-weed-kids-go-bed-no-different-glass-wine-11124325/">argued that they wouldn’t do the same.</a></p>

      <p>Regardless of divided opinion, Caitlin wants to have transparent conversations about mental health issues.</p>
      <p>She continued in her Facebook post: ‘Anxiety takes a huge toll on me physically, not just mentally.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t wear lower cut shirts without someone looking at my chest, asking why is so red and scratched up.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t go anywhere where there is a lot of people, without telling myself, that I am not sick. I am not going to throw up. I haven’t come down with a flu in ten seconds.</p>
      <p>‘I need to remind myself that I have anxiety.</p>
      <p>‘I need to remind myself that it’s okay to take a minute alone in the bathroom, or that it’s okay to leave a party early.</p>
      <p>‘So, next time you want to tell someone anxiety is all in their head, or it’s not as bad as we make it seem, take a look at my forehead and chest.</p>
      <p>‘Remember my scratched up, bloody skin, before you tell someone it’s all in their head.’</p>
