      <p>It may come across as absurd and preposterous but to this day, there is a stigma around adolescent females in the rural parts of one of the two African countries that were never colonised — Ethiopia. (Liberia is the other one.)</p>
      <p>In the rural parts of Ethiopia, young girls suffer because they are denied opportunities. And they are denied these opportunities just for being “human”.</p>
      <p>Yes, in some Ethiopian communities, young girls suffer ignominy and often drop out of school altogether just because of something as natural as menstruation.</p>
      <p>Yes, as many as half the girls in rural parts of Ethiopia miss school for reasons related to their periods — and that often hampers their education, and by extension, the rest of their lives. What an anomaly!</p>
      <p>Freweini Mebrahtu — an Ethiopian who has a degree in Chemical Engineering from the US — has dedicated her life fixing that anomaly. And for her efforts, she has been named the 2019 Hero of the Year by <i>CNN.</i></p>

      <p>Mebrahtu was voted the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year, beating 9 others who made up the <i>Top 10 CNN Heroes</i> finalists, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/30/world/cnn-heroes-top-ten-2019/index.html">despite being the only African in the top 10</a>. She was recognised for her efforts in designing a reusable menstrual pad and trying to end the cultural stigma around the issue.</p>
      <p>Mebrahtu designed and patented a reusable menstrual pad in 2005. She and her team produce 750,000 reusable pads a year at her factory in Ethiopia. Nearly 800,000 girls and women have benefited from her work.</p>
      <p>More than 80 percent of the pads she manufactures are sold to non-governmental organizations that distribute them for free.</p>
      <p>“I don’t even know what to say,” Mebrahtu <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/08/world/freweini-mebrahtu-2019-cnn-hero-of-the-year/index.html">said</a> when receiving the award. “I am so humbled and grateful for CNN … this is for all the girls and women everywhere. Dignity for all.</p>
      <p>The victorious Ethiopian has firsthand knowledge of the stigma around young girls and periods.</p>
      <p>“I remembered (hearing) that it’s actually a curse to have a period … or that it meant I am ready to be married, or (that) I’m being bad,” Mebrahtu told <i>CNN</i>.</p>

      <p>To intensify efforts aimed at stopping the stupid stigma, Mebrahtu has joined ranks with the nonprofit, <i>Dignity Period</i>, to end the stigma around the issue by speaking at schools and teaching girls and boys that menstruation is natural, not something a subject of ridicule or something to be embarrassed about.</p>
      <p>“The whole goal was not only making the pads but also attacking the cultural baggage to it,” she said.</p>
      <p><i>Dignity Period </i>has distributed more than 150,000 free menstrual hygiene kits purchased from Mebrahtu’s factory. Data gathered by the group shows that schools visited by <i>Dignity Period</i> had a 24 percent increase in attendance among girls.</p>
      <p>Having emerged as the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year, Mebrahtu is entitled to USD 100 K to expand her work. All of the top 10 CNN Heroes for 2019 were honored at yesterday’s gala where they all received a cash award of USD 10 K.</p>
