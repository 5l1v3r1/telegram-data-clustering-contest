      <h1>Random: Remembering When One Company Ruined Christmas For Some NES Owners</h1>
      <h2>A chastity belt, but for your console</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:30:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.nintendolife.com/users/Damo" target="_blank">Damien McFerran</a></address>
      <p>This Christmas, we'd imagine plenty of Switch consoles are going to make their way under trees all over the world, promising a legion of new players a pretty incredible holiday season.</p>
      <p>However, let's spare a thought for the kids back in 1989 who got a NES from Santa, only to find that their parents had <i>also</i> bought this accursed contraption:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>That's right; parents were so scared about their children spending too much time playing video games that a company actually created a <i>physical lock</i> which prevented the NES from being used. The lock bolted onto the front of the console and covered the cartridge slot, preventing games from being inserted. <i>The cads.</i></p>
      <p>The device was also marketed as a protection against other people loading up your games and overwriting the save data, but we can't imagine many people bought it for <i>that</i> reason.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/10/6130973/safe-care-homework-first-nintendo-lock">The Verge</a>, Nintendo declined to officially endorse the $15.95 product, but Safe Care president Tom Lowe claimed to have sold 25,000 units.</p>
      <p>Of course, it's not like modern young gamers have <i>totally</i> escaped limitations on their playtime – the Switch has a parental control app, after all – but at least it's more elegant than this ugly chastity belt for your beloved console.</p>
      <p>Can you think of a worst Christmas present? <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/animal_crossing_amiibo_festival"><b>Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival</b></a>, perhaps, but it's a close call.</p>
