      <p>Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told his players to take the positives following their 2-1 loss to Manchester United in a Premier League tie, Saturday.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the defeat left City 14 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>And following the loss to United, the club’s midfielder Rodri, said the Spaniard did not blast the players.</p>
      <p>“The manager always takes the good points,” Rodri told Metro UK. “He tried to lift our heads up. It is a tough moment for the team, but we have to keep fighting.</p>
      <p>“We have other cups, other goals which are interesting and very good, so we need to keep fighting and of course recover people because we have lots of problems with injuries – it’s been tough at the beginning of the season.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City will take on Arsenal in their Premier League showdown at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.</p>
