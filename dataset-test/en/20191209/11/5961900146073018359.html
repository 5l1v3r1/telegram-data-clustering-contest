      <h1>Here’s Lizzo Twerking In A G-String At An NBA Game After Professing Her Love For A Player</h1>

      <p>The LA Lakers hosted the Minnesota Timberwolves in an NBA game on Sunday night, but the only reason I know that is because <b>Lizzo </b>absolutely stole the show.</p>

      <p>The ‘Truth Hurts’ singer gave a stellar court side interview, in which she professed her love for Timberwolves player <b>Karl-Anthony Towns</b>.</p>
      <p>“Let me tell you something, both teams are great,” she said in the interview. “I’m personally cheering for 32.”</p>
      <p>The interviewer later clarified if she meant Karl-Anthony Towns, to which she replied a sassy “mmhmm!”</p>
      <p>“That’s my baby!”</p>
      <p>The 8-time Grammy nominee eventually admitted that she hasn’t actually met the NBA player. But she’s Lizzo, I’m sure somebody could facilitate a meeting.</p>
      <p>But her wee little crush on Karl-Anthony Towns isn’t the only thing Lizzo made headlines for during Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>In true Lizzo (real name Melissa Viviane Jefferson) fashion, she couldn’t help but bust a move when the Lakers cheerleaders danced to her hit song ‘Juice.’</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old ‘Good as Hell’ singer twerked along to her own song before turning around to reveal her g-string.</p>
      <p>Yes, a g-string. At a Lakers game.</p>

      <p>Her dance moves and her underwear were blasted onto the arena’s jumbotron, giving the entire crowd a view of her behind.</p>
      <p>Reactions to her twerking were mixed on social media. Some fans were in full support, wishing they had the confidence to twerk to their own song butt-naked at a Lakers game.</p>

      <p>But other Twitter users weren’t so impressed with the singer’s actions, calling it “trashy” and inappropriate in front of children.</p>

      <p>Others even went so far as to call for her to be banned from attending future LA Lakers games.</p>

      <p>Maybe she’s a confident queen? Or maybe she just took it too far this time? Either way, Lizzo sure knows how to keep her name on the tip of everyone’s tongue.</p>
