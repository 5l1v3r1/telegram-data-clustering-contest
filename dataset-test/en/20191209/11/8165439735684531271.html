      <h3>Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/highschoolmusical/"><i>High School Musical's</i></a> Ashley Tisdale says she and co-star <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrgrabeel/">Lucas Grabeel</a> didn't get on during filming the first movie.</p>
      <p>She makes the revelation during a chat with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bravoandy/">Andy Cohen</a> last week.</p>
      <p>"Lucas and I didn't get along at first..."</p>

      <p>The pair played onscreen siblings Sharpay and Ryan in all three movies.</p>
      <p>She tells the host, "Lucas and I didn't get along at first, because when we were screen testing, I was giving him line readings."</p>
      <p>"And it's not an actor thing to do."</p>

      <p>Ashley explains further, "I think it was more like I don't really do method acting, but I took a class on it when I was younger."</p>
      <p>"And I do think I become a lot like the character and I think he thought I was really like Sharpay."</p>
      <p>"And it wasn't until we wrapped that he was like, 'oh, you're not that person.'"</p>

      <h3>Shag, Marry, Kill</h3>
      <p>In the same interview, Ashley plays a game of 'Shag, Marry, Kill' and her answers have caused a lot of controversy online.</p>
      <p>The three people she's asked to choose between are Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, and Zac Efron.</p>
      <p>She chooses to marry Dylan, shag Cole and kill Zac.</p>

      <p>Zac played Troy Bolton in the Disney musical from 2006 to 2008.</p>
      <p>During filming, he started dating his onscreen girlfriend and Ashley's best friend Vanessa Hudgens.</p>
      <p>They called it off in 2010 and we still don't know the exact reason for the split.</p>

      <h3>Backlash</h3>
      <p>Ashley is horrified by what's been said about her online since the admission.</p>
      <p>So she takes to Twitter to address her comments, 'It was a GAME marry, shag or kill.'</p>

      <p>'Tbh all 3 of these guys are like my brothers, also anyone questioning why I didn’t pick Zac is very weird.'</p>
      <p>Presumably referencing her good pal Vanessa, Ashley says, 'Y’all know who my best friend is...'</p>
      <p>'I would be mortified if this said I wanted to “sleep” with zac'</p>
