      <p><b>Washington </b>- Doctors commonly prescribe metformin to help people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar levels. The drug increases insulin sensitivity through its effects on glucose metabolism.</p>
      <p>Metformin may hold surprising benefits in the fight against age-related illness.</p>
      <p>However, although there is clear evidence of metformins effectiveness, scientists do not fully understand how it interacts with cells and tissues at the molecular level.</p>
      <p>Using cell cultures and mice, the researchers identified numerous biochemical switches for turning various cell and molecular processes on and off.</p>
      <p>The findings shed light not only on metformins mechanism of glucose control, but also on a surprising number of other reactions and pathways.</p>
      <p>Large-scale clinical trials of metformin are already under way to test the drugs effectiveness in extending life span and health span that is, the proportion of a persons life span that they spend in good health.</p>
      <p>However, the underlying biochemistry has been unclear.</p>
      <p>Teams from three research centers worked on the study: the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Scripps Research Institute both in La Jolla, CA and Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.</p>
      <p>"These results," says Reuben J. Shaw, one of the studys corresponding authors, "provide us with new avenues to explore in order to understand how metformin works as a diabetes drug, along with its health-span-extending effects."</p>
      <p>"These are pathways that neither we, nor anyone else, would have imagined," he adds.</p>
      <p>Shaw is a professor of molecular and cell biology at the Salk Institute and director of the Salk Cancer Center.</p>
      <p>More recently, scientists have found that metformin may be effective in a number of other conditions, including obesity, cancer, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
      <p>Other recent research has also suggested that metformin may have anti-aging effects Trusted Source and an ability to protect bone, especially during the early phases of rheumatoid arthriti</p>
