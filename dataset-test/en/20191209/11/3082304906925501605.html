        <b>WADA has banned Russia from international sporting events after a panel recomended RUSADA be declared non-compliant again.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Russia has been banned from international sporting events for four years by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</p>
      <p>Athletes will not be able to compete under the Russian flag at the 2020 Olympics or the 2022 Winter Games, while Russia’s place at the 2022 World Cup is also in jeopardy.</p>
      <p>A WADA panel last month recommended the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) be declared non-compliant again over inconsistencies in anti-doping data discovered during an investigation.</p>
      <p>WADA’s independent Compliance Review Committee (CRC) recommended strong sanctions be imposed on Russia, including a four-year ban from competing in and hosting major sporting events.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the body’s Executive Committee unanimously agreed with the recommendation at a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>RUSADA has 21 days to appeal the suspension, which would see its case referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <p>Individual Russian athletes will still be able to enter global competitions under a neutral flag, as was the case for 168 Russians at the 2018 Winter Olympics when the country was banned.</p>
      <p>The International Standard for Code Compliance by Signatories does not list UEFA as a “major event organisation”, so Russia will also be free to compete at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Stanislav Cherchesov’s side have qualified for the finals, where St Petersburg is one of the host cities.</p>
      <p>Other concerned parties, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), can also appeal if RUSADA chooses not to.</p>
      <p>An appeal from the IOC, another Olympic committee or an international federation would have to come within 21 days of RUSADA accepting WADA’s decision.</p>
