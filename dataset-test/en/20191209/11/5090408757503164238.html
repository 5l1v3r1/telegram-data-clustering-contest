      <p>Russia has been barred from competing in international sports for four years after an investigation from the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p>
      <p>Russia was found guilty of manipulating laboratory data to mask banned substances in its athletes during an investigation in January, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/50710598">the BBC reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The ban means the country will be unable to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.</p>
      <p>Russian athletes who were not implicated in the doping scandal <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-12/wada-executive-committee-unanimously-endorses-four-year-period-of-non-compliance">will be able to compete</a>, however, under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Lindacath/status/1203988005918248962">WADA’s vice president, Linda Helleland, said on Twitter</a> that she believed the punishment was still “not enough” and that the organization owed it “to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible.”</p>
      <p>Russia has 21 days to appeal the ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
