      <p>The game started well for the Patriots, who scored a touchdown on their first drive while Mahomes threw an interception on the Chiefs' first trip up the field.</p>
      <p>The signal-caller seemed to injure his right hand on the second drive but stayed on the field to help his side score 23 unanswered points, securing the win despite a late New England rally.</p>
