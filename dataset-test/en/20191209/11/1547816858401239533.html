      <p>It's raining men, Halleluja. Well, well indeed it's raining men when it comes to picking some of the hottest men of Hollywood. We were kinda tired of boasting about the sensational women of Hollywood, hence, we are here ogling over the sexy men from the west. On Hollywood's Hot Meter today, we have hot and happening men of Hollywood making our hearts skip a beat wearing some classy tuxedos and suits. John Legend, Nick Jonas, Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Gerard Butler are making us go weak in knees with their macho avatars.<br/><br/>Starting with Priyanka Chopra's pati, Nick Jonas never fails to impress with his dressing sense. He has always been perfect when it comes to styling and we simply love when he pulls off some awesome suits during performances. Recently he wore a shiny green suit paired with a black t-shirt and oh-boy, he looked ahh-mazing.</p>

      <p>Next, we have the sexiest man alive, John Legend. The All of Me singer often loves to slip into a well-fitted suit and he made our jaws drop to the floor when he pulled a green suit along with a white shirt and a black tie.</p>

      <p>Dwayne The Rock Jonhson is the only one who can rock a pink blazer with such confidence. At the promotional event of Jumanji The Next Level in London, Dwayne carried a blazer in pink, teamed with blue pants, a white shirt, and bow tie. What a combo!</p>
