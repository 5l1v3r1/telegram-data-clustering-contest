      <p>So, you want to vote in the general election this Thursday - but you cannot find or don't think you have received the poll card.</p>
      <p>And now you don't know if you are registered or where to go to vote.</p>
      <p>Don't worry, here is our two-step guide on what to do.</p>
      <p>Firstly, to check you are registered you need to contact the local authority. If you live in Bristol, visit this <a href="https://www.bristol.gov.uk/voting-elections/check-if-you-re-on-the-electoral-register">page</a> on the city council website or call up 0117 922 3400.</p>
      <p>If you are then registered, the good news is you do not need a poll card to vote.</p>
      <p>All you need to know is where the polling station is.</p>
      <p>To find this out visit this <a href="http://www.wheredoivote.co.uk/">www.wheredoivote.co.uk</a> and type in your post code to get the address of your station.</p>
      <p>All stations are open from 7am to 10pm.</p>
