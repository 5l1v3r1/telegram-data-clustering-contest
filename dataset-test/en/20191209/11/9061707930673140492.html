      <p>A scam warning has been issued after a couple were conned by a fake TV salesperson at a motorway service station.</p>
      <p>The husband and wife were travelling from Chester to Bedford when they stopped at Corely Services South car park <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">on the M6.</a></p>
      <p>The pair were offered a 'brand new TV from Costco' but when they got it home they realised it was only a screen.</p>
      <p>Neighbourhood Watch volunteers have shared their story in a bid to raise awareness of the scam, <a href="https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/couple-duped-tv-fraudsters-corley-17385665">CoventryLive reports.</a></p>
      <p>"Before leaving a man with a van stopped next to us offering brand new TVs from Costco claiming that he worked there as a delivery man," the post reads.</p>
      <p>"He wasn't alone, there was a young guy with him around 20s and a small child. Being naive we bought one TV from him, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/crime">TV was packed up and looked decent.</a></p>
      <p>"When we got home unpacking the TV we realised that it's just a blank TV screen, no connectors on the back."</p>
      <p>They have contacted police about the incident, which happened on December 7 at around 2pm.</p>
      <p>It has prompted Neighbourhood Watch members to warn: "If someone approaches you offering a seemingly great deal on things such as TVs, laptops, iPads and even mattresses whilst in a car park or similar setting, please call the police immediately."</p>
      <p>Anyone who wants to report any similar incidents or who has any further information should call police on 101.</p>
