      <p>LOS ANGELES, Dec 9 — The seven-member boy band — which is comprised of J-Hope, Jimin, Suga, RM, Jungkook, Jin and V — has recently announced that they are in the middle of creating material for a forthcoming new album.</p>
      <p>The K-pop sensation broke the news during Variety’s Hitmakers brunch at the Soho House in West Hollywood this weekend, where they received the award for Group of the Year.</p>
      <p>“The great news is that we are currently working on our new music and new album and can’t wait to share them with you guys in the near future. I hope you guys are so excited to discover what BTS has in store in 2020,” RM teased in the band’s acceptance speech.</p>
      <p>Details about BTS’s forthcoming new studio album are still scarce at this date, as the supergroup has yet to announce an official release date.</p>
      <p>The band unveiled their sixth EP, <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i>, last April.</p>
      <p>The full-length was notably led by the record-breaking <i>Boy With Luv</i> featuring Halsey, whose accompanying visual smashed YouTube’s record for most views in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The <i>Clementine</i> vocalist has recently reunited with BTS bandmate Suga on <i>SUGA’s Interlude</i>, which will appear on her forthcoming third album <i>Manic</i>.</p>

      <p>As Billboard pointed out, BTS dominate most of the publication’s year-end charts, occupying half of the rungs inside the top 10 on the list of the “world” albums that performed the best throughout the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>What’s more, their managing company Big Hit Entertainment revealed that their “Love Yourself: Speak Yourself” mega tour drew a total audience of more than two million at 62 shows in 23 cities.</p>
      <p>In addition to working on a new album, the chart-topping septet will be at the centre of the forthcoming drama series, <i>A BTS Universe</i>, which is slated for release in the second half of 2020.</p>
      <p>As Entertainment Weekly pointed out, J-Hope, Jimin, Suga, RM, Jungkook, Jin and V will not star in the TV series, with the boy band members being portrayed as younger versions of themselves and therefore by other performers. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
