      <p>Blaze bosses have also commissioned a nationwide TV advert highlighting the dangers of cooking while drunk.</p>
      <p>The Christmas period is usually one of the busiest times of year for the SFRS.</p>
      <p>The rise in incidents is often caused by an increase in use of heating, candles and electrical appliances - and can be linked to higher alcohol consumption.</p>
      <p>A total of 509 domestic fires were recorded in Scotland between December 10 2018 and January 14 2019 - with 91 people injured in the blazes while four people died.</p>
      <p>More than 40 per cent of the casualties were aged 60 or over.</p>
      <p>Glasgow was the worst hit area with 93 domestic blazes - more than double that of Edinburgh, which is next on the list with 39.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Officer Ross Haggart, SFRS Director of Prevention and Protection, said: “Ultimately, we want people to remember the festive period for all the right reasons.</p>

      <p>“When our firefighters have to attend a fire in someone’s house at Christmas time, and we enter a house which is burning but full of Christmas presents and decorations – it’s heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>“But unfortunately, the festive period sees potentially deadly combinations come together – increased use of electricity, drinking alcohol and cooking, decorations being put up near heat sources.</p>
      <p>“It’s all too easy to think that it will never happen to you - but it can.</p>

      <p>“That’s why we are appealing to communities across Scotland – don’t let Christmas end, or your New Year start, with tragedy.”</p>
      <p>Cooking is still the main cause of house fires in Scotland - and it can become more dangerous when twinned with boozing.</p>
      <p>ACO Haggart said: “When it comes to celebrating and marking the occasion – please do not drink, then attempt to cook.</p>
      <p>“Cooking remains the number one cause of house fires in Scotland and often alcohol is a contributing factor, especially during this period.</p>
      <p>“Consider making something beforehand and have it prepared, or wait until you are no longer affected by alcohol.”</p>
      <p>Community Safety Minister Ash Denham said: “While we want people to be able to celebrate and relax over the festive period, it is extremely important that they also keep themselves and others safe.</p>
      <p>"For that reason I’d urge people to follow the advice of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and act responsibly.”</p>
      <p>If you, or someone you know, is vulnerable or may be at risk from fire please get in touch and arrange a free home fire safety visit with local firefighters by calling 0800 0731 999.</p>
