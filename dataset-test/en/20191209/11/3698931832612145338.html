      <h1>Two expected Samsung Galaxy S11+ upgrades that would make power users happy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:40:11+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>It’s not easy to introduce a new flagship smartphone every year. For 2020, Samsung appears to be going all out with significant upgrades on its upcoming Galaxy S11+. Ahead of its expected launch in Q1 2020, reliable leakster Ice Universe has dropped a couple of juicy details for the upcoming flagship smartphone.</p>
      <p>In the camera department, the Galaxy S11+ is said to be incorporating a high-resolution 108MP image sensor. The sensor is quite huge at 1/1.3″, which is similar to the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/25/xiaomi-mi-note-10-pro-fans-review-experiencer-details/">Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Pro</a>. Although the pixel count and sensor size is similar, Ice Universe has clarified that this is a custom sensor and it will be superior to the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/08/12/samsung-108-sensor-isocell-bright-hmx/">ISOCELL Bright HMX unit</a> that’s currently used on Xiaomi’s new smartphone.</p>

      <p>Since the Samsung Galaxy S11 series is a flagship, you can expect faster image processing and better AI-assistance in imaging, especially with a processor like the Snapdragon 865. For greater versatility, the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/report-galaxy-s11-camera-to-feature-5x-optical-zoom-108mp-camera/">upcoming device</a> is speculated to feature a telephoto lens that can do 5X optical zoom.</p>

      <p>It was reported earlier this year that Samsung’s camera department has started <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/05/21/samsungs-new-5x-optical-zoom-camera-smartphones/">mass-producing</a> 5x optical zoom camera modules. They had <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/01/28/samsungs-acquisition-optical-zoom-phones/">acquired Coreophotonics</a>, a company that had previously worked with Oppo on a <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2017/02/27/oppo-optical-zoom-5x-periscope-mwc-2017/">periscope camera system</a>. The module is said to be 5mm thin which makes it ideal to be fitted onto a flagship smartphone without excessive protrusion.</p>

      <p>Apart from photography, Ice Universe has shared a picture of what appears to be the battery cell of the Galaxy S11+ that comes with a huge 5,000mAh battery. As a comparison, the Galaxy Note 10+ has a 4,300mAh battery and even the Huawei Mate 30 Pro comes with a 4,500mAh unit.</p>
      <p>Not only it would be sufficient to support 5G, the large battery is also said to be an indication that a fluid 120Hz refresh rate display might be offered on the upcoming S11+. Are you looking forward to the Galaxy S11 series? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
