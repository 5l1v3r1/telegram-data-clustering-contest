      <p>Sussex Police has launched an investigation into the alleged abuse, which has been condemned by Wolves.</p>
      <p>The incident came on the weekend the Premier League dedicated to supporting the Rainbow Laces campaign which promotes LGBT inclusion in sport.</p>
      <p>Rainbow coloured flags and banners were on show as the two teams came onto the field at Brighton's Amex Stadium, while the home supporters held coloured cards aloft.</p>
      <p>Clubs and players across the Premier League backed the campaign over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Sussex force confirmed two men had been arrested following reports of homophobic gestures during the 2-2 draw and that they had been released as the investigation continues.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "Two football fans were arrested following reports of homophobic gestures made at the Amex Stadium on Sunday, December 8.</p>
      <p>"The suspects – both away fans during Brighton and Hove Albion’s match against Wolverhampton Wanderers – were identified by club stewards and arrested on suspicion of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.</p>
      <p>"The two men – aged 46 and 48, and both from Bridgnorth in Shropshire – have been released under investigation pending further inquiries."</p>
      <p>Wolves said in a statement: "Wolves can confirm that there were two arrests for homophobic abuse at yesterday’s game against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>"There is no room in football or society for discrimination of any kind, and the club strongly condemns such behaviour.</p>
      <p>"Our ethos at Wolves is about being ‘One Pack’ - an attitude our supporters are very passionate about and that extends to our relationships across the football community, regardless of rivalries on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"The club is now offering its support to Sussex Police in what is a criminal investigation."</p>
      <p>It was another incident which marred the weekend's action after a Manchester City supporter was arrested for alleged racist abuse during the derby with Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Everton are also investigating reports of homophobic chanting during their game with Chelsea.</p>
