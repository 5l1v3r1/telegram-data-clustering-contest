      <p>Only days ago she said she was ‘too busy’ for Thom Evans, but Nicole Sherzinger was back hanging out with the rugby player last night.</p>
      <p>The Pussycat Doll <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/nicole-scherzinger-busy-thom-evans-breaks-silence-romance-rumours-11231252/">recently said on Good Morning Britain</a> that although Thom, who was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/left-x-factor-celebrity-last-night-semi-final-11208778/">booted off The </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/left-x-factor-celebrity-last-night-semi-final-11208778/">: Celebrity</a> last month, was ‘lovely’, she is ‘crazy busy’ at the moment.</p>
      <p>However, the pair were seen leaving the Boulevard Theatre in London together following Nicole’s musical theatre stage show.</p>

      <p>Nicole looked incredible in a black bustier leotard, knee-high boots and fur, possibly faux fur, jacket.</p>
      <p>Thom was all wrapped up in a grey sweater and jeans but was obviously feeling toasty enough to carry his coat in his arms.</p>

      <p>Before leaving the theatre in Soho, the pair were seen chatting on a stairwell.</p>
      <p>Both Nicole and Thom have both fended off questions about their relationship, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/x-factor-celebritys-thom-evans-gets-flustered-nicole-scherzinger-dating-rumours-11195402/">Thom getting seriously flustered when he appeared on Loose Women</a> a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Nicole told Good Morning Britain: ‘Thom is lovely, but as you just reminded me how crazy busy I am, that’s totally what I’m focused on right now.’</p>

      <p>Even Nicole’s fellow X Factor judges Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh chimed in about the suspected romance, teasing Nicole after Thom, 34, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/x-factor-celebritys-simon-cowell-louis-walsh-put-nicole-scherzinger-spot-confirm-romance-try-stars-thom-evans-11207751/">peformed on the show with his man-band Try Star</a>.</p>
      <p>Viewers were left even more confused when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/x-factor-celebrity-fans-baffled-nicole-sherzinger-voted-off-try-star-amid-romance-rumours-thom-evans-11207920/">Nicole later voted off Thom’s band</a>.</p>
      <p>Nicole, 41, who had a leading role on the West End stage in 2014 playing Grizabella in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s hit musical Cats, has been performing musical theatre numbers as well as some of her hit singles. She is set to perform again tonight.</p>
      <p>The X Factor judge is enjoying being on the stage again, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/pussycat-dolls-confirm-reunion-without-bandmate-melody-thornton-11231607/">recently reuniting with her former dance troupe</a> turned pop stars The Pussycat Dolls.</p>
      <p>The group, comprised of Ashley Roberts, 38, Kimberly Wyatt, 37, Carmit Bachar, 45, and Jessica Sutta, 37, are certainly giving it their all, as their<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/03/nicole-scherzinger-reveals-pussycat-dolls-left-battered-bruised-fall-x-factor-celebrity-performance-11259809/"> supercharged performance on X Factor left them battered and bruised.</a></p>
