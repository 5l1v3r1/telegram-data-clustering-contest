      <p>The BJP needed to win at least six of those 15 seats to remain in a majority in the assembly. The party also enjoys the support of an independent lawmaker. In the current assembly the party has 105 of the 208 seats.</p>
      <p>The strength of the assembly was reduced following the disqualification of 17 MLAs. This development led to the toppling of the JD(S)-Congress government which was headed by H D Kumaraswamy.</p>
      <p>The two parties with a combined strength of 101 seats will need to win at least 12 seats in order to be able to form the government in Karnataka.</p>
