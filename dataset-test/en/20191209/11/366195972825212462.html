      <p>Last week, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/NickCannon/profile">Nick Cannon</a> pondered whether or not he should even respond to <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/eminem-goes-at-nick-cannon-over-mariah-carey-on-fat-joe-track-lord-above-news.97549.html">Eminem's diss bars on Fat Joe's new record "Lord Above."</a> <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/nick-cannon-mocks-eminem-in-diss-response-get-out-your-wheelchair-news.97611.html">The comedian took to his radio platform to mock the legendary Detroit rapper, telling him to bring his wheelchair to a street fight</a>. While it appeared as though the entertainer wasn't down to get on wax against Marshall Mathers, he's doing just that and, surprisingly enough, he's bringing along some friends.</p>
      <p>Joined by Hitman Holla, Charlie Clips, and Prince Eazy, the feature that will grab the most attention is from none other than Suge Knight. "The Invitation" starts off with a message from Suge, which was recorded during a prison phone call. The man says that he considers Cannon as family, laying out The Black Squad's invitation and dissing Em quickly.</p>
      <p>The first verse is easily the most lethal, containing some personal bars about Marshall's family and a supposed videotape that exists showing the rapper performing oral sex on another man. "I heard your chauffeur got a video of you sucking a c*ck/You paid him off then laid him off, now who really the opps," raps one of the artists.</p>
      <p>Cannon claims that he will be applying pressure until he gets a response. Do you think this will warrant one?</p>
