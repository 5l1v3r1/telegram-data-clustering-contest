      <h1>Huawei stands by HarmonyOS approach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:11:29+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#mannypham" target="_blank">Manny Pham</a></address>
      <p>A Huawei executive revealed the company plans to expand the range of devices running its HarmonyOS in 2020 and push the platform globally, but explained the immediate focus excludes mobile devices, <i>Reuters</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The news agency stated Wang Chenglu, president of the software unit at Huawei’s Consumer Business Group, revealed the plans during a store opening in Shenzhen, citing local press reports.</p>
      <p>Huawei’s aim is to continue its launch strategy for the OS, which involves a heavy focus on devices including smart TVs rather than immediately positioning the platform as a replacement for Android on its smartphones.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Wang told reporters the Google platform remained the vendor’s preferred choice for smartphones.</p>
      <p>Huawei launched HarmonyOS in August, apparently in response to the imminent loss of access to Android resulting from a US trade ban.</p>
      <p>HarmonyOS was <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/huawei-makes-its-os-play/">unveiled</a> by Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s Consumer Business Group (<i>pictured</i>), in August as a countermeasure to <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/huawei-slams-fcc-equipment-ban/">US trade restrictions</a> covering hardware and software. At the time, the vendor said the OS and its kernel would be adopted in smart screen products this year, with plans to expand it to a wider range of devices including wearables over the following three years.</p>
      <p>Huawei’s most recent smartphone, the <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/apps-home-banner/huawei-debuts-mate-30-without-google-apps/">Mate 30</a>, came with no Google apps, but runs the Android-based EMUI 10 interface rather than HarmonyOS.</p>
      <p>To bolster the HarmonyOS apps library, Guo Ping, Huawei deputy chairman highlighted Huawei’s credentials as an <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/huawei-chief-plays-up-partnership-potential/">outlet for developers</a>, noting 5G offers a chance to build a new ecosystem.</p>
