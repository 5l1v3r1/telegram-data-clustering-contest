      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Goldman-Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> raised its oil price forecasts for 2020, citing tighter-than-expected inventories after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/OPEC">OPEC</a>) and its allies agreed to deepen oil output cuts through the first quarter of next year.</p>
      <p>"We are increasing our forecast for backwardation in 2020 although our long-term marginal cost forecast remains unchanged," Goldman analysts wrote in a note dated Dec. 6.</p>
      <p>The bank revised its Brent spot price forecast to $63 per barrel for 2020, up from a previous estimate of $60, while it also increased West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot price outlook to $58.5 per barrel from $55.5.</p>
      <p>Brent futures were down 0.3 per cent at $64.19 per barrel, as of 0632 GMT, having risen sharply last week after OPEC and its allies agreed to deepen output cuts.</p>
      <p>Oil producers led by <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Saudi-Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and Russia, agreed on Thursday to cut output by an extra 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2020 but stopped short of pledging action beyond March.</p>
      <p>The decision, "crystallizes an important shift in OPEC+ behavior to managing short-term physical surpluses and deficits rather than trying to correct perceived long-term imbalances through open-ended commitments," the Wall Street bank said.</p>
      <p>The bank revised its supply-demand forecast, reflecting lower OPEC+ production path in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>"These revisions lead us to forecast a broadly balanced 2020 global oil market, 0.3 million bpd tighter than our previous forecast."</p>
      <p>Goldman lowered its demand growth forecast by 50,000 bpd, citing prospects for a modest recovery in global growth, driven by higher consumer spending but a still-challenged manufacturing sector. The bank now projects its demand growth forecast at 0.9 million bpd and 1.2 million bpd for 2019 and 2020, respectively.</p>
