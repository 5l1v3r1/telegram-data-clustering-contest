      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> are one of a host of clubs 'looking closely' at Charlton Athletic striker Lyle Taylor, according to recent reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-charlton-hopeful-over-lyle-taylor-amid-interest-from-sheff-utd-burnley-forest">Teamtalk is reporting</a> this morning that several Championship and Premier League are interested in the forward, who is out of contract at the end of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/bristol-city-fulham-championship-verdict-3620433">The likes of the Robins</a>, Nottingham Forest, Burnley, Sheffield United, Norwich and Brentford are all reportedly monitoring his contract situation.</p>
      <p>Is it said that Charlton are desperate to extend his stay at the Valley, with Taylor scoring 25 goals in all competitions for the Addicks last season.</p>
      <p>Teamtalk reports that a new contract looked unlikely under former owner Roland Duchatelet, but could be feasible under new owner Matt Southall.</p>
      <p>Charlton are attempting to persuade Taylor to stay and help them stay in the Championship, with the club languishing in the bottom half of the league.</p>
      <p>Taylor made his long awaited return from injury this weekend in the loss to Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>The former Wimbledon forward is <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-boss-sends-transfer-message-3622389">one of a number of forwards being linked with Lee Johnson's side</a>, who are keen to add to their ranks in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The likes of Eddie Nketiah, Connor Wickham and Rhian Brewster have all also been linked with City.</p>

      <p>Lee Johnson and CEO Mark Ashton have both hinted at January activity at Ashton Gate, but it is unclear whether any club would move for Taylor in the winter window.</p>
      <p>At the start of December, when asked if City will look to do business in January, Mark Ashton said: "Yes, I think it would be remiss of me to say no, but it has to be right.</p>
      <p>"It has to be right. The worst thing we can do is take the wrong one."</p>
