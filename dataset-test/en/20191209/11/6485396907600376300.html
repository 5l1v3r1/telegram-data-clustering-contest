      <h1>Who’s Leading The Democratic Primary In Super Tuesday States?</h1>
      <h2>And beyond.</h2>

      <p>You’ve heard how South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is coming on strong in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/iowa/">Iowa</a>. You’ve heard how <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/new-hampshire/">New Hampshire</a> is a free-for-all. And you’ve heard about former Vice President Joe Biden’s firewall in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/nevada/">Nevada</a> and especially <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/south-carolina/">South Carolina</a>.</p>
      <aside>Including Democrats Abroad.</aside>
      <p>But the Democratic primary won’t end after those four states, especially if no clear winner emerges from them. That means the <a href="http://frontloading.blogspot.com/p/2020-presidential-primary-calendar.html">16 states and territories</a><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-leading-the-democratic-primary-in-super-tuesday-states/#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> that vote on March 3 — Super Tuesday — could be critical to Democrats’ selection of a nominee; together they are estimated to be worth more than a <a href="https://www.270towin.com/2020-democratic-nomination/">third</a> of Democrats’ pledged delegates.</p>
      <aside>As of Friday, Dec. 6.</aside>
      <p>Despite these places’ importance, though, there’s been relatively little coverage of which candidates might have an advantage there. Of course, plenty will probably change between now and Super Tuesday. In addition to the normal fluctuations in the horse race, the results in the first four states will likely winnow the field, too. But I still think it’s worthwhile checking in on the polling in some important March states to see what the race looks like now.<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-leading-the-democratic-primary-in-super-tuesday-states/#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
      <p>Appropriately given its outsized number of delegates, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/california/"><b>California</b></a> has been one of the most frequently polled states over the past two months:</p>

      <p>And the polls there have shown some stark disagreements: Some have given Biden a solid lead, while others find a decisive edge for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and the most recent found Sen. Bernie Sanders in a virtual tie for first. A simple polling average shows Warren at 24 percent, Biden at 22 percent and Sanders at 19 percent. If those are their final percentages in California, the state’s huge trove of 416 delegates (the most of any one primary or caucus) would be split three ways. But, again, it’s still early.</p>
      <p>Notably, Buttigieg is only averaging 9 percent in California, which is another reason to believe, at least at this stage, that he might have trouble building on potential strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. And it’s not in the table, but home-state Sen. Kamala Harris averaged 8 percent across these seven polls before she <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-kamala-harriss-campaign-failed/">dropped out</a>, so whoever picks up her support in the Golden State could alter the shape of the race, too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/texas/"><b>Texas</b></a> has the second-biggest delegate haul (228) of both Super Tuesday and the entire primary calendar, but unlike California, signs point to a front-runner: Biden (although, with only two polls conducted in the state in the last two months, we don’t have the clearest picture of the race there).</p>

      <p>After all, only the most recent poll — from the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/20191118_TX.pdf">University of Texas at Tyler</a> — was conducted after former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, a native son of Texas, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-beto-orourkes-pivot-didnt-work/">exited the race</a>. And he got 14 percent in that <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/11/04/democrats-dont-have-candidate-who-would-beat-trump-texas-today-poll/">YouGov poll</a>, so a fair number of voters may still be up for grabs in the Lone Star State.</p>
      <p>Continuing down the line, the third-most important Super Tuesday state in terms of delegates is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/north-carolina/"><b>North Carolina</b></a> with 110.</p>

      <p>We’ve gotten several polls in the Tar Heel State in the last two months, with all five indicating that Biden has a healthy lead. This should come as no surprise in a state that, like South Carolina, has a large base of black voters. In 2016, the Democratic primary electorate was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/nc/Dem">38 percent nonwhite</a>.</p>
      <p>But beyond those three delegate-rich states, we don’t have a lot of recent Super Tuesday polling. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/virginia/"><b>Virginia</b></a> (99 delegates), the most recent poll was conducted almost <i>three</i> months ago. And while it showed Biden with a <a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2019/09/27/biden-leads-democratic-nomination-in-virginia-umw-survey-finds/">comfortable lead</a>, demographically the state is also fertile ground for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/buttigiegs-centrist-pivot-may-be-winning-him-a-new-base/">Warren or Buttigieg</a>, given that college-educated whites constituted <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/va/Dem">almost half</a> of its 2016 Democratic primary electorate. Indeed, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/massachusetts/"><b>Massachusetts</b></a>, Super Tuesday’s fifth-biggest prize with 91 delegates, has an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/ma/Dem">even higher share</a> of college-educated white voters, and Warren led there by 15 points in the <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/10/23/wbur-poll-warren-medicare-for-all">most recent poll</a> from mid-October. But of course, Massachusetts is also Warren’s home state, which could be a factor here as well. That said, she also took 25 percent and first place in the <a href="http://files.kff.org/attachment/TOPLINE-Blue-Wall-Voices-Project">most recent poll</a> of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/minnesota/"><b>Minnesota</b></a> (75 delegates), in which home-state Sen. Amy Klobuchar also received a respectable 15 percent.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, Super Tuesday is a black box. There hasn’t been a survey of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/colorado/"><b>Colorado</b></a> (67 delegates) since August. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/tennessee/"><b>Tennessee</b></a> (64 delegates), <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/alabama/"><b>Alabama</b></a> (52 delegates) and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/oklahoma/"><b>Oklahoma</b></a> (37 delegates) haven’t been polled since July, although demographically the first two at least should be good fits for Biden. Meanwhile, <b>Arkansas</b> (31 delegates) and <b>Utah</b> (29 delegates) haven’t seen any polls.</p>
      <p>October did bring us two surveys of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/maine/"><b>Maine</b></a>, but they disagreed as to whether Biden or Warren was leading, but considering only 24 delegates are at stake, it probably won’t be what makes or breaks Super Tuesday for a candidate. Same with <b>Vermont</b> (16 delegates), <b>Democrats Abroad</b> (13 delegates) and <b>American Samoa</b> (six delegates), where there are also zero polls — although we can probably be pretty confident that Sanders will win his home state. (He has a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/senator-rankings-q3-19/">65 percent approval rating</a> there and won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/vermont">86 percent</a> there in the 2016 primary.)</p>
      <p>In summary, it looks like Biden and to a lesser extent Warren would start out with the advantage on Super Tuesday. Biden leads in two of the three biggest states (Texas and North Carolina), plus probably multiple Southern states (Tennessee, Alabama, maybe Virginia and Arkansas). Warren likely leads in two mid-size states (Massachusetts and Minnesota) but also figures to amass a significant delegate haul from California, which currently looks like a jump ball. And while we can only say with confidence that Sanders is favored to win one state, he definitely has a chance to pick up plenty of delegates by finishing a respectable second or third in many other places.</p>
      <aside>Including one poll whose field period only partially fell within the last two months.</aside>
      <p>The further out you go on the calendar, there’s even more good news for Biden. One week after Super Tuesday, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/michigan/"><b>Michigan</b></a> (125 delegates) will be the big prize, and Biden leads in an average of the three polls taken there in the last two months<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-leading-the-democratic-primary-in-super-tuesday-states/#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a>:</p>

      <p>As for the states that will vote in April or later, most of them have seen no recent polling — and arguably, this is pretty justifiable, since the race is so unpredictable that deep into the calendar. It’s quite possible Biden or another candidate will have sewn up the nomination by this point anyway. But if not, look for a few states to be the differentiators. For example, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/wisconsin/"><b>Wisconsin</b></a> (77 delegates) is set to vote on April 7, and recent polls show a very unsettled race there:</p>

      <p>Of course, by this point in the race, I’d be surprised if there are more than two candidates left standing, so there may be a chance for, say, Warren to consolidate anti-Biden support and win these states, too. Like a real-life choose-your-own-adventure book, the primary could still unfold along hundreds of paths. But it’s also important to remember there are several massive states still to vote after Iowa (41 delegates), New Hampshire (24 delegates), Nevada (36 delegates) and South Carolina (54 delegates) — and right now, Biden has far more delegates waiting for him in those states than <i>any</i> candidate is likely to amass in February.</p>
