      <h1>Russia banned from international sport for 4 years</h1>
      <h2>Moscow accused of ‘extreme’ cheating and ‘fraud.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:16:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ali Walker</a></address>
      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency slapped Russia with a four-year ban from participating in international sports, including the Olympics, Monday.</p>
      <p>The decision came after Moscow was accused of manipulating athletes’ doping records and falsifying drug laboratory data that was turned over to WADA in January.</p>
      <p>While Russia as a nation will be banned from the coming two Olympics, some individual Russian athletes may be permitted to compete, if they can prove in advance that they are clean — as happened at the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-olympic-ban-anti-doping-chiefs-hit-out/">Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics</a>.</p>
      <p>WADA’s executive committee voted unanimously to ban Russia during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. During the meeting, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/linda-helleland-norway-wada-clean-sport-reformer/">Linda Helleland</a>, the organization's outgoing vice president, accused Russia of “extreme” cheating and “complete denial of the fraud” it perpetrated.</p>
      <p>Margarita Pakhnotskaya, a senior official at Russia's anti-doping agency, told POLITICO that while the decision is not pleasant for Russia, it is "legal and logical."</p>
      <p>The Russian sports ministry has <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/28027088/russia-denies-manipulation-key-doping-data">repeatedly denied</a> wrongdoing in a litany of doping scandals that have blighted high-level international sports this decade. It is expected to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <p>The next summer Olympics will be held in Tokyo in July/August 2020, and the next winter Games will take place in Beijing in February 2022.</p>
