                            <p>Led by New Zealand’s captain Kane Williamson, Hyderabad released domestic batsman Ricky Bhui, domestic all-rounders Yusuf Pathan and Deepak Hooda, Bangladesh all-rounder <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/shakib-al-hasan-likely-to-face-18-month-ban-after-not-reporting-corrupt-approach-to-icc/">Shakib Al Hasan</a> and New Zealand opening batsman Martin Guptill last month.</p>
                            <p>Having released the likes of Pathan and Hooda, SRH will surely be looking for a hard-hitting middle-order batsman for IPL 2020.</p>
