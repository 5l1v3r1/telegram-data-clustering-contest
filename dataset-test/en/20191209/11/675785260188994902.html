      <h1>New Premier League plans to improve VAR emerge as football chiefs look to sort current chaos</h1>
      <h2>The system has come in for criticism since it was introduced to the Premier League at the start of the season but it could soon be in for a revamp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:57:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Plans are being put in place to display further information on big screens at Premier League football grounds when there is a VAR decision taking place.</p>
      <p>The system has been criticised this season for sometimes leaving match-going supporters in the dark, with fans unhappy they are not being told why a VAR check is in progress.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7769789/SPORTS-AGENDA-Premier-League-makes-new-bid-clear-VAR-chaos-Guardiola-books-Burnley-break.html">Daily Mail</a> , however, the Premier League have met with operators of the big screens at each club in London this week to discuss the logistics behind displaying extra information.</p>
      <p>Currently when there is a check all that is put on the screen is 'VAR check in progress', followed by the final verdict when a decision has been made.</p>

      <p>This means that supporters often have no idea exactly what the system is checking, which has led to frustration and booing inside stadiums.</p>
      <p>The matches set to take place on December 21 and Boxing Day later this month have been earmarked as the ones where the additional information will be implemented.</p>
      <p>There will also be two meetings this Friday to discuss other potential improvements to the system at the Premier League's base at Gloucester Place in London.</p>
      <p>Fans at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will still be left in the dark even with the new additional information, however, as they do not have a big screen inside their grounds.</p>
      <p>VAR has split opinion ever since its implementation, and as always there were a number of controversial calls in the weekend's action, such as in the Manchester derby.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> midfielder Rodri admitted after the game <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/rodri-admits-man-city-players-21055072">he and his teammates are fed up with the system</a> , saying: "We are p***ed off by it but there is no point (talking) for us," he said.</p>
      <p>"We have to keep fighting and don't focus on these things.</p>
      <p>"It is other people's jobs - we can't scream. Some decisions can change matches and VAR is there for getting decisions (right). It is not an excuse for us."</p>
