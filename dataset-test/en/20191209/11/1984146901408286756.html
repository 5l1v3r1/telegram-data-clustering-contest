      <p>After keeping the judges, studio audiences and millions of viewers at home throughly entertained for the past three months, Chris Ramsey bowed out of Strictly Come Dancing on Sunday night and wife Rosie can't wait for him to get home.</p>
      <p>South Shields comedian <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/chris-ramsey">Chris</a> and dancing partner Karen Hauer exited the ballroom in fourth place after landing in the bottom two for the second consecutive week.</p>
      <p>But unlike seven days earlier, when Chris &amp; Karen stayed in the competition ahead of Alex &amp; Neil, all four <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> judges opted to save Karim &amp; Amy, sealing their fate.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old has given millions of viewers plenty of memorable moments including his salsa to Uptown Funk in Blackpool, mean and moody paso doble and of course the Couples' Choice routine to Geordie anthem Let's Get Ready to Rhumble by PJ &amp; Duncan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/chris-ramsey-leaves-strictly-dancing-17385148">Chris left the show to a raputurous reaction</a> , with judges, dancers and audience members all on their feet and back at home in Shields, Rosie posted a brilliant tribute to her husband.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, Rosie wrote "Flipping heck! Warra journey!!  Chris you have been incredible and it’s been wonderful seeing the real man I know come across so lovely on the TV. <br/>"BUT I have told you all of this to your face so........ .What I really want do here right now is give my sincere thanks to Karen from the bottom of my heart for being so fantastic. <br/>"You have been so patient with Chris and I honestly don’t think he would have ever got this far without you. You have been nothing but respectful throughout this whole process and I really want to thank you for that because it has made it so much more enjoyable for me personally.</p>
      <p>Making reference to the raucous weekly viewing parties that often left her feeling more shattered than Chris himself, Rosie added "Also thank you  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcstrictly/">@bbcstrictly</a>  for bringing my family together. Our  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/strictlyparties/">#StrictlyParties</a>  will be remembered forever!"</p>
      <p>And then in the comments of the post she left a cheeky message to her other half, writing "NOW GET HOME AND GET THE F***** TREE UP!"</p>
      <p>If you've listened to Chris and Rosie's chart-topping podcast S******, Married, Annoyed recently you'll know that Rosie has a fear of going into the loft to get the Christmas tree down, so the longer Chris stayed in Strictly the longer the tree was missing in action.</p>
      <p>Chris &amp; Karen's exit leaves Kelvin &amp; Oti, Emma &amp; Anton and Karim &amp; Amy in the running for the Glitterball trophy, which will be decided in next week's live Strictly final.</p>
