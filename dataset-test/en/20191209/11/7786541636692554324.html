      <p><b>BrusselsÂ (AP)</b> - European Union foreign ministers debated Monday how to respond to a controversial agreement between Turkey and Libya that could give Turkey access to a contested economic zone across the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
      <p>The maritime border deal, endorsed by the Turkish parliament last week, has fueled tensions in Turkey's long-running dispute with Greece, Cyprus and Egypt over oil and gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Greece has already expelled the Libyan ambassador over it.</p>
      <p>Before chairing the meeting, new EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that "it's not a matter of sanctions today." He said the ministers would study a "memorandum of understanding" agreed upon between Turkey and Libya, which was only made public in recent days.</p>
      <p>Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said "it's a little bit astounding how they split up the Mediterranean among themselves. We'll have to see how we deal with it."</p>
      <p>Greece, Cyprus, and Egypt, which lie between Turkey and Libya geographically, have blasted the accord as being contrary to international law. Some EU partners of Greece and Cyprus seem to agree.</p>
      <p>"The Netherlands is always a staunch supporter of the rule of international law, and we side with Greece," said Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok. "International law should be upheld."</p>
      <p>Although they are NATO allies, neighbors Greece and Turkey are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the 1970s, including once over drilling rights in the Aegean.</p>
