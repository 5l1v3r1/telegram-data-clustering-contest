        <b>With the tagline ‘Hungry? Face it’, Nets has launched a pilot programme testing facial recognition at a cafeteria in Denamrk.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Around 1,000 people - all working at Vibenshuset, an office community of 25 companies in Copenhagen - can sign up to participate in the pilot, which links their face with their employee ID card to pay for lunch by staring into a screen.<br/><br/>Jesper Kildegaard Poulsen, head of Creation Lab, Nets, comments: “We are used to bringing something with us each time we need to make a payment - cash, card or a device. But maybe it doesn’t have to be this way. What if you could pay by just showing up?<br/><br/>"How people feel about having their faces scanned is still under question. This trial will help us to learn more about consumer attitudes to facial recognition payments.” <br/><br/>He says merchants offering self-service solutions would be the most obvious adopters of facial recognition technology: "Imagine the solution at a burger bar where you are recognised at the self-service counter and asked: ‘Do you want the same meal as last time, Jesper?’ This is where we see the largest potential.”<br/><br/>The trial follows an earlier experiment at Copenhagen Business School with biometric vein pattern recognition, which has so far successfully passed 22,000 transactions.</p>
