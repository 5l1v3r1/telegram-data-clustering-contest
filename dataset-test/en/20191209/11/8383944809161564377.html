      <p>The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) on Monday lowered the reference values it uses to determine required reserve ratios for banks, while introducing a consumer price index adjustment and other changes to loan growth calculations.<br/><br/>The central bank had previously announced that banks with a loan growth rate of 10-20% will be subjected to lower required reserves ratios and higher remuneration rates.<br/><br/>Reuters previously reported that the central bank would strengthen the link between lending and reserve requirements and adjust settings regularly to steer credit toward certain sectors.<br/><br/>The bank Monday said its changes to required reserve regulations aim to channel loan supply to production-oriented sectors rather than consumption-oriented ones.<br/><br/>The regulations will encourage long-term commercial loans that have a strong relation with production and investment, and long-term housing loans that have a weak relation with imports, the bank said in a statement.<br/><br/>According to an announcement in Turkey's Official Gazette, banks that have a CPI-adjusted loan growth rate of between 5% and 15% will be subjected to a 2% required reserve ratio on most lira deposits.<br/><br/>The changes also include the removal of some housing and consumer loans from banks' loan growth calculations, a move seen as encouraging commercial and long-term housing loans.<br/><br/>At the new top limit of 15% loan growth, housing loans with a maturity of five years or more, as well as loans, excluding consumer loans and credit cards, with terms longer than two years will be subtracted from the total loan growth.<br/><br/>Banks will need to remain at or above 5% growth after the annual change in 50% of consumer loans and credit cards is subtracted from the total loan growth rate.<br/><br/>The 2% required reserve ratio will apply to lira deposits of all terms, except deposits and participation funds with a maturity of one year or more, as well as other liabilities with more than a three-year maturity.<br/><br/>For banks that do not fall within the new reference values, required reserve ratios are set at 4-7% for deposits with maturities less than a year.</p>
