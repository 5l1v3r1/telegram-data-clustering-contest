      <h1>Good Morning Britain 'shake-up' as Piers Morgan works Friday for General Election coverage</h1>
      <h2>Joked he will be putting in a shift on Friday as a 'national duty'</h2>

      <p>Piers Morgan will 'drag' himself back into work on Friday to helm <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a>'s coverage of the General Election.</p>
      <p>Many GMB fans were delighted to hear the ex newspaper editor will be working on his usual day off.</p>
      <p>But there's no need to fret Piers will be overworked and turn up for five days (or even four days) in a row this week because of the shake up - he'll still be taking Thursday off.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers</a>, 54, joked to viewers earlier today he will be putting in a shift on Friday as a 'national duty'.</p>

      <p>"There's an election special, so my weekend will not be starting on Wednesday morning as it normally does," Piers said.</p>
      <p>"I've got to be dragged back in here… shocking."</p>
      <aside>It's not a full week is it? You won't be doing Thursday.</aside>
      <p>Fellow host Susanna Reid pointed out: "It's not a full week is it? You won't be doing Thursday."</p>
      <p>Piers replied: "No, but four days is a real stretch.</p>

      <p>"But I will do it for you lot - I will do it for the nation."</p>
      <p>Chuckling, Susanna fired back: "I thought you were going to say you would do it for the money, which might be more honest."</p>
      <p>Many viewers gave the change to the usual presenting line up of Kate Garraway, Charlotte Hawkins and Ben Shephard the thumbs up.</p>
      <p>"How could you not love Piers. Hilarious as always!" tweeted one viewer.</p>

      <p>"GMB is only best when Piers Morgan is on," claimed another.</p>
      <p>A third added: "We need you on Friday."</p>
      <p>However, one social media user objected: "The nation would rather you didn't."</p>
      <p>And another added: "That's one way to ruin my Friday morning @gmb, I'll he watching @BBCBreakfast instead now!"</p>
