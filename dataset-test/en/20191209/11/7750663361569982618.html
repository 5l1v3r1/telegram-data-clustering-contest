      <h1>Manchester City 'preparing for Pep Guardiola exit'</h1>

      <p>Guardiola joined City in 2016 after leaving Bayern Munich but has never stayed in one job for more than four seasons, a milestone he will reach at the end of this term.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Mirror</i>, City have begun making arrangements for his potential exit, although it is reported that Guardiola may be open to extending his contract beyond 2021.</p>
      <p>The report states that the club fear the 48-year-old might walk away from the job if they are able to win the Champions League this season, a trophy he has only won with Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The arrangements reportedly involve recruiting a new backroom member of staff who would work closely with the first team squad, and would become more hands-on in their approach if Guardiola was to leave.</p>
      <p>Manchester City currently sit third in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League table</a> but are 14 points adrift of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/title-race/news/pep-guardiola-maybe-we-cant-compete-with-liverpool_382239.html">league leaders Liverpool</a>.</p>
