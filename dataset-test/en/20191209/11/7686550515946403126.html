      <h1>Welsh rugby's winners and losers as Welsh teen nicknamed 'Speedy' dazzles in Champions Cup while coach masterminds former club's painful defeat</h1>
      <h2>Here are the winners and losers from a busy weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:14:08+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Woolford</a></address>
      <p>With the General Election approaching, the fate of Wales four regions exiting or remaining in Europe became a little clearer at the weekend.</p>
      <p>With the Heineken Champions and Challenge cups taking centre stage, we look at Welsh rugby's winners and losers from a busy weekend...</p>
      <h3>WINNERS</h3>
      <h3>LOUIS REES-ZAMMIT</h3>
      <p>He's already being likened to Gloucester's former favourite son Jonny May.</p>
      <p>And judging by his jet-propelled boots, Cardiff-born 18-year-old <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/electric-welsh-rugby-teenager-wayne-17304917">Louis Rees-Zammit</a> - nicknamed 'Speedy' by his coach Johan Ackermann - would give the England wing a run for his money over a 100-yard dash.</p>
      <p>The giant strides he's made at Kingsholm this year are only matched by the ground-munching pace that seems to leave opposing defenders looking like snails nursing a hernia.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, he kept the Cherry &amp; Whites' flickering hopes of reaching the Champions Cup knockout stages alive and in the process added another mark in the club's record books in their 26-17 win over Connacht.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>His match-winning touchdown at a time when the west country side trailing the PRO14 outfit 10-7 made Rees-Zammit Gloucester's youngest try-scorer in Champions Cup history at 18 years old and 309 days.</p>
      <p>It showcased the serious gas the Welsh teenager has when he latched onto Danny Cipriani's pass to sprint away from the covering defence and dab down under the posts.</p>
      <p>His pace also served him well when he got back to make a try-saving tackle on Eoghan Masterson when Connacht were pushing for a try to get back into the contest in the final 10 minutes.</p>
      <h3>ROBIN MCBRYDE</h3>
      <p>The former hooker looks to have got a right result swapping being Wales' forwards coach under Warren Gatland to be assistant boss at Leinster under Stuart Lancaster and Leo Cullen.</p>
      <p>It could be argued McBryde has an equal array of forward riches at his disposal as he did when overseeing the Welsh pack for the last 13 years after being first appointed by Gareth Jenkins.</p>
      <p>And on Saturday they crushed Gallagher Premiership high-flyers Northampton Saints 43-16 at Franklin's Gardens in front of the Channel 4 TV cameras with the luxury of keeping the likes of Tadhg Furlong and Rob Kearney on the bench.</p>
      <p>It was a statement of intent from the Dubliners they are hell bent on bettering their final defeat at the hands of Saracens in the final at Newcastle St James' Park last season.</p>
      <p>For McBryde and his Leinster pack, which the Saints failed to match physically, will have even greater resources as the season progresses given hooker Sean Cronin and back-rowers Dan Leavy and Jack Conan are on the injured list.</p>
      <h3>LONDON WELSH RFC</h3>
      <p>They've still got rugby's equivalent of Mount Everest to climb in being able to plant their flag back on the summit of the English game.</p>
      <p>But the world famous club that went into liquidation in December, 2016, before being kicked out of the professional game the following month amid financial struggles, are making slow but positive steps.</p>
      <p>Having to start again in the ninth tier of English rugby, having been a Premiership club in the 2015-16 campaign, successive promotions have seen Cai Griffiths' side make it to London Two North West this term.</p>
      <p>With only one club guaranteed to go up, the Exiles delivered a big blow to one of their promotion rivals at the weekend with an emphatic bonus-point 34-7 victory over Chiswick.</p>
      <p>It gives them a two-point cushion over Hammersmith &amp; Fulham in second, having played a game less while Chiswick are in third a further point behind as Welsh made it nine from nine at the weekend.</p>
      <h3>TOBY FRICKER</h3>
      <p>Ioan Lloyd and Callum Sheedy have been hogging much of the Welsh spotlight for their performances at Bristol Bears this season.</p>
      <p>But there's another qualified to wear the three feathers going about his business at Ashton Gate, who could well have bagged the bonus point try at the weekend that gives the Bears a potential home quarter and semi-final in the European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Stade Francais may be bottom of the Top 14 but they were denying Bristol a bonus-point win at the weekend until former Ebbw Vale wing Fricker, whose father hails from Builth Wells, came up with the goods with the clock buried deep into the red.</p>
      <p>His fine finish in the corner was his third European try in as many games.</p>
      <p>A win in Paris in the return next weekend would guarantee qualification and keep the west country club in pole position to earn home advantage in the last eight and semi-finals should they progress to the final four.</p>
      <h3>CARMARTHEN QUINS RFC</h3>
      <p>For someone whose first rugby memories were watching Pontypool in their pomp in the 1970s, it was hugely refreshing to see a well-executed lineout drive remains de rigueur some 40 or more years later.</p>
      <p>They may not have the likes of Graham Price, Tony Faulkner, Bobby Windsor, Jeff Squire and Terry Cobner and John Perkins providing the necessary grunt up front but the Quins showed in front of the Scrum V cameras at Aberavon what a destructive weapon in your armoury the lineout drive can be.</p>
      <p>The Wizards really had no answer to it, other than taking off a few front-rowers and calling for passive lineouts, as the forward surge came to Carmarthen's rescue in a 34-29 win at the Talbot Athletic Ground.</p>
      <p>It seems Aberavon weren't the only Premiership side to leak tries to the Quins from lineout drives this term as their finely-tuned surge for the line has caused a whole heap of problems before Friday night.</p>
      <p>And they showed Pontypool it could be an intriguing WRU National Cup quarter-final clash when the Championship leaders host Quins on the weekend of January 25.</p>
      <h3>TOMMY REFFELL</h3>
      <p>The Wales Under-20s flanker is getting himself a top-notch rugby education at Welford Road, despite Leicester Tigers' struggles in the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>In the Challenge Cup, Leicester sit proudly on top of Pool Five with three wins from three including victory at rivals Cardiff Blues.</p>
      <p>The Bridgend-born back-rower played his part in seeing the Tigers maintain the top spot in a Leicester XV including the likes of Manu Tuilagi, Jonny May, George Ford, Ben and Tom Youngs plus Dan Cole in their 59-7 win over Calvisano.</p>
      <p>Reffell crossed for Tigers' opening try in the second period as Leicester became the first English side to win their opening three Challenge Cup games since Wasps in 2002.</p>

      <h3>JOSH ADAMS AND JARROD EVANS</h3>
      <p>Adams' second regional match in Wales is certainly more memorable than his only ever appearance for the Scarlets way back in May, 2014, when the wing wizard was on the losing side in an Anglo-Welsh Cup clash with the Cardiff Blues.</p>
      <p>More than five and a half years on he marked his debut for Cardiff Blues with a hat-trick of tries as they rocketed to a sensational victory over Pau in the European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>The bonus point success kept them three points behind leaders Leicester Tigers, who had demolished Calvisano, at the top of Pool Five.</p>
      <p>Evans was also a key man piling up 22 points from two tries and six conversions and generally pulling more strings than a time served puppeteer.</p>
      <h3>LEIGH HALFPENNY</h3>
      <p>The flawless boot of Halfpenny kept the Scarlets' hopes of a Challenge Cup quarter-final alive in a battling win over Bayonne.</p>
      <p>The Wales full-back, making his first appearance for the region this season, kicked 14 points from the tee to secure the Scarlets' first win in France in more than five years.</p>
      <p>He punished Bayonne's indiscipline time and time again and despite the 19-11 scoreline, the victory was secured with relative ease.</p>
      <p>The win now moves the Scarlets into second place in Pool Two - five points behind leaders Toulon as we reach the halfway stage of the group stage.</p>
      <h3>LOSERS</h3>
      <h3>MERTHYR RFC</h3>
      <p>These are testing times for The Ironmen.</p>
      <p>A home defeat in the Welsh Premiership have been a rare as hen's teeth during their march to three successive titles.</p>
      <p>But their rivals are now spotting Dale McIntosh's men are not the force they once were and are now biting back, even on trips to The Wern.</p>
      <p>At the weekend, it was the turn of Llanelli ​to stun the champions in their own backyard through a late converted Gareth Havard try.​</p>
      <h3>DAN BIGGAR</h3>
      <p>Critics of the Welsh No.10 should take a long hard look at the former Osprey churning out consistently high levels of performances at Northampton Saints.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old is different gravy under the gameplan adopted by Chris Boyd at Franklin's Gardens and you just hope Welsh coach Wayne Pivac gives the 79-times capped star a similar stage to display his wares.</p>
      <p>Despite Saints' 43-16 defeat to Leinster on Saturday, Biggar hardly put a foot wrong. Pity it wasn't the same story for the top part of his body as he received a stern telling off from referee Alexandre Ruiz for his conduct.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Dan Biggar receives his telling off on the ref mic</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The frustrated official was unhappy with Biggar's vocal outbursts during the first half of the match as the fired-up Welshman threw everything into his performance.</p>
      <p>He was vociferous when Rhys Ruddock crossed for his try, believing the Leinster back-rower might not have grounded the ball when clearly he had. He was then warned to control his temper as annoyed official Ruiz could bee seen summoning Biggar, shouting "Dan, Dan, Dan!"</p>
      <p>But the Welshman continued to ignore him, forcing the ref to try a more formal approach, shouting: "Mr Biggar, Mr Biggar!"</p>
      <p>When Biggar finally got the message and approached Ruiz amid jeers from the crowd, he was told: "The refereeing today is our job. Listen to me please."</p>
      <p>Biggar replied: "Of course, of course."</p>
      <p>He was then told: "You need to control. You need to control or next time it's a penalty against you."</p>
      <h3>BRIDGEND RFC</h3>
      <p>The Ravens escaped relegation last season from the Welsh Premiership by the skin of their teeth with an against-all-odds victory at Pontypridd on the final day of the season.</p>
      <p>As the festive season approaches it will need another re-run of 'The Great Escape' if they are to dig their way out of trouble this term.</p>
      <p>In losing 24-5 at home to RGC 1404, it was their seventh defeat and leaves them six points adrift at the bottom of the Premiership table.</p>
      <p>Ironically, it was the man who helped to keep them up last season, Matt Silva, who was mastermind of the RGC team that inflicted further pain on the Brewery Filed outfit.</p>
      <p>The only thing missing for Silva on his return was a bonus-point.</p>
      <p>Bridgend travel to fellow strugglers Ebbw Vale this weekend for a game that could decide which team stays up this season and who goes down.</p>
      <h3>THE OSPREYS</h3>
      <p>The Liberty Stadium region are still without a win in this season’s Heineken Champions Cup after going down 40-19 at home to Racing 92 in a match that saw Dan Evans receive one of the quickest red cards in professional rugby union history.</p>
      <p>Frank Murphy’s decision to dismiss Evans in the first minute overshadowed all else in Swansea.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Dan Evans leaves the field after being sent off against Racing 92<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And it prompted a lively debate about whether the call was the right one.</p>
      <p>The Ospreys also had Scott Williams and Aled Davies sin-binned and were down to 12 men at one point against one of the most potent back divisions in Europe.</p>
      <p>Things are not going to get any easier for the Ospreys as they make the return trip to Racing next weekend.</p>
