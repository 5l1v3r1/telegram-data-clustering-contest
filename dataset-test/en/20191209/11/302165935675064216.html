      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — The ringgit closed lower against the US dollar today as the positive sentiment for the greenback curbed interest for local currency.</p>
      <p>As at 6pm, the local note was quoted at 4.1590/1630 against the US dollar compared with Friday’s close of 4.1580/1610.</p>
      <p>A dealer said the upbeat US payrolls for November coupled with the anticipation of unchanged US interest rate by the US Federal Reserve had spurred risk appetite for the US dollar,</p>
      <p>After cutting rates three times this year to shield the US economy from the global slowdown, the central bank is expected to keep rates steady at its meeting this Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the ringgit was traded mostly lower against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The local currency depreciated against the Singapore dollar to 3.0581/0615 from 3.0571/0605 on Friday, weakened versus the Japanese yen to 3.8328/8372 from 3.8284/8315 and contracted against the British pound to 5.4703/4773 from 5.4570/4613 previously.</p>
      <p>The ringgit, however, rose vis-a-vis the euro to 4.6015/6076 from Friday’s 4.6137/6179. — Bernama</p>
