      <p>INDEPENDENT TD MICHAEL Healy-Rae has been transferred to hospital after a fire at his shop in Kilgarvan.</p>
      <p>Healy-Rae was taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution due to the potential effects of smoke inhalation.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from Healy-Rae’s Dáil office said that the Kerry TD is fine and is being checked as is standard for anyone exposed to smoke from a fire. </p>
      <p>“The man is fine,” the spokesperson said, adding that the incident is being “blown out of all proportion by the media”. </p>
      <p>In 2016, Michael-Healy Rae was hospitalised due to injuries he sustained in a <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-healy-rae-farm-2671483-Mar2016/">farming accident when he</a> was attacked by the cow after she calved. </p>
