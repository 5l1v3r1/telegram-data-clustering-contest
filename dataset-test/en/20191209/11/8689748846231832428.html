      <h1>Video of when Cardi B told organisers she cannot meet Ghanaian celebrities pops up</h1>

      <p>Social media for the past 24 hours has been buzzing after some so-called Ghanaian celebrities were snubbed in a supposed ‘meet and greet’ with American rapper, Cardi B at the Kempinski hotel.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, some self-acclaimed Ghanaian celebrities including Afia Schwarzenegger, Akuapem Poloo, Moesha Hajia4real, and the likes were subbed by the ‘Press’ hitmaker.</p>
      <p>They expressed their frustration out of anger making Cardi B reply them in an equal manner via Instagram live.</p>
      <p>Well, there is a new video trending online that suggest the American rapper was aware of the meet and greet session but apparently, she was too tired to engage in that and moreover, such sessions are held after a show.</p>
      <p>In the video making rounds on social media, when the organisers of the Livespot festival approached Cardi B and told her about the “Meet and Greet Cardi B” session at Kempinski hotel, a tired Cardi B could be seen expressing gestures indicating that she cannot meet the Ghanaian celebrities who were lined up at Kempinski Hotel.</p>
      <p>This video in a way explains why Cardi B never gave a hoot about Ghanaian celebrities in the first place.</p>
