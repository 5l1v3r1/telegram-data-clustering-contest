      <h1>(Video) Noel Gallagher’s smarmy pre-season prediction of ‘irrelevant’ Liverpool has not aged well</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:49:35+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City fan Noel Gallagher didn’t think Liverpool would be anywhere near his team this season…</p>
      <p>The former Oasis star claimed on Sky Sports in the summer that we were ‘irrelevant’ and would crash and burn after coming second in 2018/19 – labelling our failure to win the title with 97 points as ‘too funny’.</p>
      <p>Liverpool currently top the Premier League table and are 14 points ahead of City, so he was perhaps right to suggest such a gap would emerge between the two clubs!</p>
      <p>We’re not arrogant enough to write off City, though. They’re an amazing side and will surely bounce back from this poor run at some stage.</p>
      <p>Still, it’s quite nice to watch this from Gallagher! We’re looking forward to his explanation, soon.</p>
