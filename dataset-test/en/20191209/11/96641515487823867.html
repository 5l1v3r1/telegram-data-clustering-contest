      <h1>First 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' trailer entrusts Ecto-1 to Egon's grandkids</h1>
      <h2>Finn Wolfhard saving the day in a small, haunted town sounds familiar.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:14:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/marc-deangelis" target="_blank">Marc DeAngelis</a></address>
      <p>Nearly a year after audiences got a super short tease of the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/09/sony-ar-ghostbusters-experience-japan/"><i>Ghostbusters</i></a> movie, we finally have a full trailer. <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> is a continuation of the original series -- unlike Paul Feig's 2016 reboot -- and is being directed by Jason Reitman, the son of series director Ivan Reitman. Finn Wolfhard and his sister arrive in a rural town after inheriting a mansion from a mysterious family member. After paranormal activity shakes the area, the kids discover their grandfather's trove of ghost hunting equipment -- a jumpsuit labelled "Spengler" is among the PKE meters and proton packs.</p>
      <p><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> looks very different from the original two movies. In fact, there are some elements of the film that are completely opposite from the <i>Ghostbusters</i> formula: Kids appear to be the protagonists instead of adults, and the film takes place in a rural area rather than a major city. The movie also seems like more of an adventure flick than a comedy. The lack of the series' famous theme song is almost jarring. In other words, it's clear that <i>Afterlife</i> isn't a rehash of the first two movies.</p>

      <p>While Harold Ramis, who played Egon Spangler, died in 2014, most of the main cast from the original movies is slated to reprise their roles. So while Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts don't appear in the trailer, expect to see the old guard make a cameo at the very least.</p>
      <p><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> will hit theaters on July 10, 2020. If you need your fix sooner, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/30/ghostbusters-video-game-remastered-playstation-ps4/">remaster</a> of the 2009 <i>Ghostbusters</i> video game is available on the Xbox One, PS4 and Switch.</p>
