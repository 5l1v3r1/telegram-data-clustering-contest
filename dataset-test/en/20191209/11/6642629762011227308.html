      <p>Activists have barged into the building that houses the office of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/malta.html">Malta</a>'s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to demand his immediate resignation amid an investigation into the 2017 killing of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.</p>
      <p>Muscat is not directly implicated in the investigation but has said he will resign on January 12 after an election for a new leader of his ruling Labour Party.</p>
      <p>Testimony by the self-confessed middleman in the murder plan has linked people in the prime minister's inner circle to attempts at a cover-up.</p>

      <p>About 40 activists surprised policemen and soldiers early on Monday as they forced their way into the 16th-century building in capital Valletta from a side entrance, armed with drums, whistles, flags and loud hailers.</p>
      <p>They sat down and blocked the entrance, chanting for Muscat to quit. He was not in the building at the time.</p>
      <p>Caruana Galizia, described by supporters as a "one-woman WikiLeaks", <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/malta-businessman-detained-journalist-murder-police-source-191120090337261.html">highlighted corruption</a> in Malta, including among politicians, before she was killed by a car bomb in October 2017.</p>
      <h3>'Political murder'   </h3>
      <p>The political stability of the Mediterranean island has been rocked by the case in recent weeks. </p>
      <p>Muscat's chief of staff Keith Schembri was named among those involved or aware of the plot. Schembri has resigned and is under investigation. He has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>"Malta has reached rock bottom. This is not just about corruption, but about political murder," the activists said over a loud hailer during their protest.</p>
      <p>They said Muscat's position was untenable and demanded a comprehensive investigation of all the people named, "not a cover-up".</p>
      <p>Police and soldiers watched over the activists who made no attempt to go upstairs, where the administrative offices are located. </p>
