      <h1>Bitcoin ransomware locks 10 years’ worth of government data in Argentina</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:58:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin-hungry hackers have attacked a data center in Argentina which houses local government files.</p>
      <p>According to Alicia Bañuelos, Minister of Science and Technology of the local government of San Luis, said the attack took place on November 25.</p>
      <p>In <a href="http://agenciasanluis.com/notas/2019/12/02/la-provincia-hara-una-denuncia-penal-por-el-ciberataque-al-data-center/">an interview</a> with Agencia de Noticia de San Luis — a local government digital news outlet — on December 2, Bañuelos said the center had already recovered 90 percent of the encrypted data. Some 7,700 GB — approximately 10 years worth data — was originally compromised as a result of the attack.</p>
      <p>“Decrypting the files will take at least 15 days, mostly due to the sheer size of the archive,” Bañuelos added during the interview.</p>
      <p>The size of the Bitcoin ransom is unknown, but reports suggest attackers asked for somewhere in between approximately $37,000 and $370,000 (0.5 and 50 BTC) in exchange for decrypting the files.</p>
      <p>Just last week, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/05/bitcoin-ransomware-sodinokibi-data-center-us/">Hard Fork reported</a> on how a major US data center had been hit by Sodinokibi, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/08/23/hackers-behind-texas-ransomware-attacks-want-2-5-million/">a prominent</a> strand of ransomware which several months ago earned a hacker <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/14/sodinokibi-ransomware-earns-hacker-287k-worth-of-bitcoin-in-3-days/">$287,000 worth of Bitcoin</a> in just three days.</p>
      <p>Governments have proved to be popular targets. A group of cybercriminals calling themselves the “Shadow Kill Hackers” <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/25/hackers-give-johannesburg-government-3-days-to-pay-over-30k-in-bitcoin/">attacked the City of Johannesburg</a> (South Africa) administration website in late October and threatened to upload the stolen data on the internet unless they received a $300,000 (4 BTC) Bitcoin ransom.</p>
      <p>Hackers are also targeting private companies, including Spanish multinational security firm Prosegur, which was <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/29/prosegur-ryuk-ransomware-bitcoin-payment/">hit by Ryuk</a> ransomware under two weeks ago.</p>
