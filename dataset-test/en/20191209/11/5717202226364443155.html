      <h1>Arsenal fans react as Unai Emery linked with vacant Everton job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:45:02+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Everton have reportedly made an approach for Unai Emery and have held a meeting with the Spanish manager in London following his exit from Arsenal – and Gunners fans have predicted Emery to prove a good appointment at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/11882197/unai-emery-former-arsenal-boss-approached-by-everton-for-manager-job">Sky Sports have claimed</a> that Everton have met with Emery and have held talks in London following Marco Silva’s sacking last week. Duncan Ferguson took interim charge on Saturday, beating Chelsea 3-1.</p>
      <p>Emery was sacked by Arsenal after failing to win a Premier League match in almost two months. The Gunners remain without a league win since October 6, even with Freddie Ljungberg taking over the last two games against Norwich and Brighton.</p>

      <p>It is believed Emery met with Everton for an ‘informal meeting’ in London. The Spaniard is open to a move to England, a return to Spain or a job in Italy – but has requested more time to make a decision, though he is keen to return to management soon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7769801/Vitor-Pereira-favourite-Everton-job-club-step-search-successor-Marco-Silva.html">The Daily Mail claim</a> seven other managers are on Everton’s shortlist – Carlo Ancelotti, Leonardo Jardim, Eddie Howe, Vitor Pereira, David Moyes, Ralf Rangnick and Mauricio Pochettino are the names suggested.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans have reacted to the reported news that Everton are now keen on bringing Emery to Merseyside, and many Arsenal fans believe that a move to Everton would be a good move for Emery – and The Toffees would also benefit.</p>
