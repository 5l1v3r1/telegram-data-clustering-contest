      <p>What is the cost of damaging a tree by the road? If you are in Siddipet town of Telangana, you may have to shell out an amount running into thousands.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night, a Mahindra Xylo SUV lost control and rammed into a median at Government Medical College in Siddipet. Upon learning about the incident from the police, the horticulture officers of Siddipet municipality took up the matter, and have imposed a fine of Rs 9,500 on the driver.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time a fine has been imposed for damaging trees. The horticulture officers have since September 2018 collected over Rs 1.2 lakh towards penalties collected on damages to ‘Haritha Haram’ plants. A man had earlier removed 30 Haritha Haram plants from a plot and was fined Rs 30,000. This is the maximum fine imposed so far.</p>
      <p>‘Haritha Haram’ is an ambitious re-forestation programme of the state government.</p>
      <p>Samalla Ilaiah, horticulture officer, Siddipet municipality, who has been actively imposing fines against those who damage the plants, told <i><a href="http://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a></i> that so far, lakhs of trees have been planted across Siddipet.</p>
      <p>Saplings are being planted on either side of the roads and on medians, and according to Ilaiah, his team of 30 labourers are on a daily job of watering plants and planting new ones. “A lot of money is spent on the upkeep of these trees. Imposing fines will send out a strong message to the offenders,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have instructions from Siddipet MLA and finance minister T Harish Rao and Commissioner Siddipet,” Ilaiah added.</p>
      <p>According to him, 50,672 plants were planted in 2018-19 and another 49,911 in 2019-20 in Siddipet.</p>
