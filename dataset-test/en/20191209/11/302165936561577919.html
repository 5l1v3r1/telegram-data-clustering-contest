      <p>WHAKATANE (New Zealand), Dec 10 — New Zealand police said early today they did not expect to find any more survivors from a volcanic eruption on White Island that killed at least five people and injured up to 20.</p>
      <p>“No signs of life have been seen at any point,” the police said in a statement after rescue helicopters and other aircraft had carried out a number of aerial reconnaissance flights over the island following the eruption on Monday afternoon.</p>
