      <p>"In the lead up to Christmas on The Late Late Show, it promises to be a session like no other!"</p>
      <p>It comes after Shane's festive hit was branded "chav bilge" by a BBC radio presenter, who said the song should be banned from the radio.</p>
      <p>The controversial comments from Alex Dyke about the Christmas hit by The Pogues were slammed online after he admitted he "no longer feels comfortable" with the song.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old shared a series of now-deleted tweets ranting about the song before hosting his show on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In the posts, he called the 1987 track an "offensive pile of downmarket chav bilge".</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Radio, let's ban Fairytale Of New York this Christmas!</p>
      <p>"'You're a slut on junk, you scumbag, cheap lousy faggot' - is this what we want our kids singing in the back of the car?</p>

      <p>"It's an offensive pile of downmarket chav bilge. We can do better!"</p>
      <p>He later reiterated his point while on air, saying: "I hope I'm not going to ruin your Christmas, but I've decided that I am no longer comfortable with playing Fairytale of New York by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl.</p>
      <p>"I think Christmas songs should be about excited children, toys, Christmas trees, snowy streets, ski lodges, reindeer, wrapping paper, Santa, family, peace on earth and love.</p>
      <p>"I just find The Pogues' Fairytale Of New York a nasty, nasty song.</p>
      <p>"I think it should be banned, I really do, so I won't be playing this record on the radio of this Christmas."</p>

      <p>He added that by not playing the song, he was "making a stand for the good of the people".</p>
      <p>A BBC spokesperson said they wouldn't actually be banning the song on their stations.</p>
      <p>They commented: "This was Alex's decision. There is no ban. We have a strict music policy that we expect to be followed."</p>
