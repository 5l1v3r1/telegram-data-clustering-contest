      <p>Presenting the textbooks to Ethiope Primary School, Okirighwre, Sapele, the President of the group, Mr. Edward Ederaine said the beneficiary schools were selected by members of the union in North America who paid for onward distribution of the textbooks to their schools.</p>
      <p>He emphasized basic education as the most fundamental of all stages of growing up.</p>
      <p>Ederaine said the objective was to help in the union’s little way of elevating the plight of the people and also compliment government effort in the educational sub-sector.</p>
      <p>“We know the efforts parents and guardians are passing through to send their wards to school so we have decided to help out by distributing these Maths and English textbooks which are the main subjects in schools,” Ederaine said.</p>
