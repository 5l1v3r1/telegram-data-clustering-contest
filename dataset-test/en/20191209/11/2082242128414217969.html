      <p>It’s Monday, as I’m sure you’re all aware. Generally it takes me until at least Wednesday to get confused about what day it is.</p>

      <p>As a palate cleanser from all that news, have this brawl:</p>

      <p>I am reminded that Nick Robertson has an <i>older, taller</i> hockey-playing brother watching him here.</p>
      <p>Also, this look at prospects running amok reminds me that the early December European break is coming up and I’ll catch us all up on who is doing what in a few days, but I believe Kokkonen is shooting a lot, Räsänen is in Denmark, Holmberg is on the first line again, and Slava Kara had a shooting % of 30 at one point.</p>
      <p>Later today, or now, if you slept in, I’ll have a post up about the roster freeze and what that means. Partly what it means is this mini trade rumour frenzy we have going on.</p>
      <p>The Leafs are supposed to be practising in Vancouver today, so expect lots of features on the families of the four BC boys: Morgan Rielly, Tyson Barrie, Alexander Kerfoot and Nic Petan.</p>
      <p>There will be news from the Board of Governors meeting as well.</p>
      <p>Egor Korshkov left the Marlies game on Sunday with some sort of injury, so given this is the Marlies, we may hear what’s wrong soon, or we might just never hear his name mentioned for a few months.</p>
      <p>Remember this guy:</p>

      <p>And since your thread on the kids today and TikTok cracked me the hell up, I bring you this bit of wisdom from the generation wars:</p>

      <p>Does this just explain so much about people my age, or what? Personally, I blame 50 year old movie producers for all those zombie flicks.</p>
      <p>I leave you with this, in the original German, because only a poseur listened to the English sell-out to radio version:</p>

      <p>Oh, and Kyle Dubas is likely behind this move. Seems like something he’d try.</p>
