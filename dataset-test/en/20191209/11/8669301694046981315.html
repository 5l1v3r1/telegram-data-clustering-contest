      <p>Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest car manufacturer, was the third highest gainer on the BSE Sensex on Monday, the first day of trade after the company reported an <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/e6b69db3-0425-4766-9d74-fdcb2dccce95.pdf">increase in production</a> for the first time in 10 months. The company’s shares closed the day at Rs 6,997.25 each, 1.7% higher since Friday.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the company said its total <a href="https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/maruti-suzuki-up-2-as-company-s-production-rises-in-november-11575866327504.html">production across segments</a> in November had increased 4.3% on year to 1,41,834 units. Output had been declining for nine months in a row due to a slump in demand.<i> </i>The carmaker’s output had declined 20.7% in October to 1,19,337 units and 17.5% in September to 1,32,199 units.</p>
      <p>The company also saw its <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/941683/maruti-suzuki-shares-recover-a-day-after-quarterly-results-showed-biggest-drop-in-profits-in-8-years">consolidated net profit</a> decline as much as 39% in the July-September quarter, to Rs 1,358.60 crore. With the entire automobile sector struggling, Maruti Suzuki had even shut down operations at its plants in Gurugram and Manesar in Haryana on September 7 and September 9.</p>
      <p>The automobile industry has been caught in the midst of a downturn that started several months back. It is one of the worst slowdowns to have disrupted the industry since the collection of data of vehicle sales started in 1997. <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/940145/auto-industry-crisis-passenger-vehicle-sales-declined-23-7-in-september-shows-data">Passenger vehicle sales</a> fell for the 11th straight month in September, registering a 23.7% decline, before <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/943329/passenger-vehicle-sales-rose-marginally-in-october-car-sales-continued-decline">increasing marginally</a> in October.</p>
