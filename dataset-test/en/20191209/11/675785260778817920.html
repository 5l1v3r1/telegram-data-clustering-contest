      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T11:15:17+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Labour's first Budget will be held on February 5 if Jeremy Corbyn wins power this Thursday.</p>
      <p>Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell confirmed the date as he outlined details of the economic plan in a speech in London.</p>
      <p>He spoke as a Survation poll put the Tories a whopping 14 points ahead of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> - with Boris Johnson's lead widening just three days before the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>But Mr McDonnell insisted “we’ve won the debate out there in the country particularly over austerity”, which <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> has admitted was wrong.</p>
      <p>Promising he had “draft plans to hand to the civil servants on Friday”, he added: “We’ve won for our vision of a brighter, fairer more sustainable future."</p>
      <p>John McDonnell said the first priority if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> gets into No10 will be ending the Tory cuts to benefits and public spending with a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Budget.</p>

      <p>And separately, Labour’s National Transformation Unit would be established in the first 12 days of government.</p>
      <p>The Unit would be based in northern England and eventually <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-labour-unveils-150bn-20826047">be tasked with spending at least £400bn over 10 years.</a></p>
      <p>Labour would also “begin the process” of renationalising water and energy firms in the first 100 days of government, the Shadow Chancellor said.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell admitted some would see the plan as too ambitious but said that was down to “10 years of Tory austerity undermining any hope of change”.</p>
      <p>Pledging to “rebuild from the wreckage” of Tory and Lib Dem rule, he added: "We’re setting our sights higher than any opposition party has ever done before.</p>
      <p>“We’re doing that because we have to. Because the scale of the challenge is greater than ever before.”</p>
      <p>Saying the UK had “no time to lose” he added: “Any future general election will be too late. We need to start this week.”</p>
      <p>Branding it "the date when almost ten years of cuts will come to an end," he said it would be "the Budget which ends austerity once and for all."</p>
      <p>He added: "This is the budget that will save the NHS, that starts to rebuild the public services the Tories have brought to their knees.</p>
      <p>"A Budget that will put money in people’s pockets, a Real Living Wage of £10 an hour. Money to fix the worst aspects of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> , while we design its replacement, a 5% pay rise for public sector workers after years of pay freezes.</p>
      <p>"The Waspi compensation scheme will be established and legislation brought forward to scrap tuition fees</p>
      <p>"Urgent funding will be brought forward rapidly to tackle the funding crisis in our NHS, our schools and education service.</p>
      <p>"To establish free personal social care and childcare, to bring forward urgent homeless support, and inject much needed resources into our council services, with a full Comprehensive Spending Review to follow later in 2020 to allocate resources for the full five years."</p>
