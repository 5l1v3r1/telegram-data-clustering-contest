      <p>Celebrity choreographer and Idols judge Somizi Mhlongo believes that he “joked” Zozibini Tunzi’s Miss Universe win into existence.</p>
      <p>This after he ran into her at a mall shortly before she departed for Atlanta in the United States, where she stayed for the duration of the competition.</p>
      <p>He reposted the video earlier today and captioned it: “I joked about it into existence and the Universe literally responded @zozitunzi.”</p>
      <p>In the video, he can be heard saying: “She’s going to Miss Universe so let’s wish her luck,” before proceeding to do a mock practice run with her of the moment her win is announced.</p>
      <p>Tunzi can then be seen wiping her imaginary tears with the wad of R200 notes in her hand.</p>
      <p>The news broke in the early hours of Monday morning after Tunzi emerged victoriously from Sunday evening’s glittering pageant.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old finished ahead of the Puerto Rican and Mexican finalists in a flashy televised event, hosted by American TV personality Steve Harvey.</p>
      <p>Various South Africans stayed awake through the night to watch a live stream of the show and got the hashtag #zoziformissuniverse trending along with various other viewers throughout the globe who decided that she should take the crown.</p>
