      <p>The project, which also won the award for small workspace interior of the year, references Italian town squares and their ability to bring people together. The piazza-style room, now the hub of the office, can be accessed and used by everyone.</p>
      <p>"We used an Italian piazza for the inspiration of the design of the project to create a space that would open up a dialogue between staff and students," explained Brad Wray, creative director and co-founder of Branch Studio Architects.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/awards/2019/winners/piazza-dellufficio/">Piazza Dell'Ufficio</a>, which translates from Italian to "office square", includes a variety of spaces that are almost entirely lined in slim <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/cardboard/">cardboard</a> tubes.</p>

      <p>"The cardboard tubes were used as a cladding device, they were also used as a partition device but it was really just about creating a cohesion of space with a single materiality," said Wray.</p>

      <p>Branch Studio Architects completely overhauled the "highly inefficient" 1970s offices, which had little natural light and were dated in appearance.</p>
      <p>Glass-fronted arched doors and dropped ceilings were added by the studio to link the series of communal work areas, breakout spaces, private offices and various sized meeting rooms.</p>

        <figcaption>The winning project was chosen for teaching children "the power of design"</figcaption>

      <p>"It is a very simple intervention for very little money that gave the school something they could be proud of, which functions extremely well and teaches the children at a very early age the power of design," said Jiricna, who sat on the interiors master jury alongside <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/matali-crasset/">Matali Crasset</a>, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/ab-rogers/">Ab Rogers</a>, Eero Koivisto and Yoko Choy.</p>
      <p>Wray also touched on the inclusivity and affordability of the project in this movie produced by Dezeen.</p>
      <p>"For us, it's really important that architecture is for everyone and not just for big developers and people with large budgets," said the creative director and co-founder.</p>
