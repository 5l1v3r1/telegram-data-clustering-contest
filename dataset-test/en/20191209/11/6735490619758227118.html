      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/09/chris-cornell-widow-vicky-sues-soundgarden-unpaid-royalties-strong-arm/"><i>TMZ</i></a>, Vicky Cornell has filed a lawsuit against Soundgarden over alleged unpaid royalties.</p>
      <p>Vicky claims that the band’s surviving members are withholding hundreds of thousands of dollars owed to her and Chris’ children in an “unlawful attempt to strong-arm Chris’ Estate into turning over certain audio recordings created by Chris before he passed away.”</p>
      <p>The legal dispute centres on seven tracks recorded by Chris, which Vicky claims were “solely authored by Chris; contain Chris’ own vocal tracks; and were bequeathed to Chris’ Estate.”</p>

      <p>She is also accusing Soundgarden lead guitarist Kim Thayil of putting her in harm’s way by suggesting that she is standing in the way of the band releasing a new album, claiming that he is intentionally misleading the band’s “loyal, rabid fan base.”</p>
