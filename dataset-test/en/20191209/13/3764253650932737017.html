      <p>America rapper Cardi B left Nigeria for Ghana on Sunday, November 8, but from indications, her visit to the neighbouring country seems to be a complete contrast of her experience in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Recall that hours after she landed in Ghana, social media was set abuzz after some aggrieved celebrities in the country vented their anger at the superstar for not honouring a meet-and-greet that had been scheduled with her, despite her presence at the venue.</p>
      <p>Well, it did not just stop there. A video is currently making the rounds online that captured the moment some members of the audience started throwing bottles at the stage.</p>

      <p>It was gathered that the fans had waited for over one hour at the venue, before the next performance. The long wait caused them to throw items at the stage.</p>
