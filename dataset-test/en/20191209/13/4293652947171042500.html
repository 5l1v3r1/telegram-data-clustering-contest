      <p><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/teams/vancouver-canucks/">Vancouver Canucks</a> goaltender <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/jacob-markstrom/547717">Jacob Markstrom</a> has rejoined the team after taking a leave of absence last week to attend his father’s memorial service.</p>
      <p>The club has re-assigned goaltender Michael DiPietro to the AHL’s Utica Comets in a corresponding move.</p>
      <p>Markstrom, 29, revealed in an Instagram post last month that his father had lost a battle with cancer.</p>
      <p>DiPietro didn’t appear in a game for the Canucks during Markstrom’s week-long absence.</p>
