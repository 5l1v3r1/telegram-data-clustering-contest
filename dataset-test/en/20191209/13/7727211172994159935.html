      <h1>Experts tell Liberal Democrats to vote Labour in Southport to kick the Tories out</h1>
      <h2>Southport is seen as a three-way marginal and for many years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:58:17+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-williams/" target="_blank">Olivia Williams</a></address>
      <p>Polling experts are telling Liberal Democrat voters in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> to switch to Labour in order to kick the Tories out in the General Election.</p>
      <p>In the last national vote,  despite backing Remain in the 2016 referendum, Southport elected a Conservative candidate in Damien Moore.</p>
      <p>In the latest constituency surveys, data shows that in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> the Tories currently lead Labour by 8%.</p>
      <p>However, this weekend polling expert and former Yougov president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/tactical-voting-guide-2019-keep-tories-out-remain-voter-general-election">Peter Kellner wrote in The Observer</a> that  enough tactical votes for Labour could defeat the Conservatives in the seaside seat.</p>
      <p>Southport is seen as a three-way marginal and for many years was a Liberal Democrat stronghold through veteran MP John Pugh.</p>

      <p>However, experts have continued to warn that without tactical voting, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> may return a pro-Brexit MP, despite having a clear Remain majority because of the way the anti-Conservative vote could be divided.</p>
      <p>Labour's Parliamentary Candidate Liz Savage welcomed the news of the tactical voting websites.</p>
      <p>She said: "We've known for some time from our canvassing that it was a straight fight between us and the Tories, and indeed the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservatives</a> themselves recently publicly said exactly the same.</p>
      <p>"The Lib Dems have angered many remainers with the arrogance of their revoke and ignore half of the country stance, just as the Tories are trying to do with the other half.</p>
      <p>"Only Labour is trying to offer everyone an informed choice on Brexit and a policy that also looks at how we bring the country together afterwards.</p>
      <p>"Crucially, our policies are also the best chance Southport has of getting the investment it so desperately needs in our services, community and town centre.</p>
      <p>"If local people want to stop Johnson's appalling Brexit deal, ensure Southport's regeneration and prevent a sell-off of our NHS to US business interests, then they should vote Labour, it really is that simple."</p>
      <p>However, in a reply on Twitter to the news of this tactical voting, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> Lib Dems said it will be a "Labour-Tory coalition in Southport."</p>
      <p>They said: "Tories and Labour in a mutual pact to back each other and keep out the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>"Tories fear losing the seat, Labour desperate to get second place. Both candidates also oppose changing to a fair voting system.</p>
      <p>"Brexit bedfellows too. Labour-Tory coalition in Southport."</p>
      <p>Between 1997 and 2017 the seaside seat was comfortably held by the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> , with veteran local figure John Pugh in office for the vast majority of those twenty years.</p>
      <p>But at the last General Election things shifted dramatically in Southport  with the Tory Mr Moore taking the seat and an impressive <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> performance knocking the once dominant Lib Dems down into third.</p>
      <p>Liz Savage took Labour's vote share from 19% to 32% as Labour enjoyed surprisingly good results across the board.</p>
      <p>While the Lib Dems were still suffering hugely from their time in coalition with the Conservatives in 2017 - they have reinvented themselves as the party of remaining in the European Union with a new leader and some impressive results in local and European elections.</p>
      <p>Before 2018 <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> had never had an elected councillor in the Lib Dem-dominated Southport area, now they have five.</p>
      <p>Tory incumbent Mr Moore's hopes of re-election have been boosted by the withdrawal of the Brexit Party candidate after leader Nigel Farage agreed not to stand against the Conservatives in any seats they currently hold.</p>
