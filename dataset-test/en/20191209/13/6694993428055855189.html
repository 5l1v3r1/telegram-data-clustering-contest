      <h1>Review: Mo Gilligan at the LoungeFest Xmas Special, Impossible</h1>
      <h2>The Lounge wrapped up 2019 with their biggest show to date - and it certainly didn't disappoint</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:08:42+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Pugh, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/rachel-pugh/</a></address>
      <p>If you've not heard of The Lounge yet, then take it from me - by 2020, you definitely will have.</p>
      <p>The Lounge was started in 2015 by entrepreneur Marvin Mensah, who is passionate about giving fresh and emerging urban talent a platform in Manchester, and brought Mo Gilligan to the stage long before he secured his gig on The Big Narstie Show.</p>
      <p>This weekend, Mo returned to the stage for The Lounge's Christmas special at Impossible's downstairs theatre, and it was an absolute cracker of a show.</p>
      <p>The event was kicked off by compère Kamilah 5 Star - who had the audience laughing from start to finish. Providing the soundtrack for the night and keeping the energy high was Marcel Stevens - a Manchester-based DJ who always keeps the energy high. It's rare to have a great DJ  filling the gaps at a comedy night, but take it from me, it works an absolute treat (comedy venues, take note).</p>

      <p>Also performing was singer KVYO and a local youth dance group - and they both warmed the crowd up perfectly.</p>
      <p>The local edge is what I love about The Lounge events. Even when big acts like Mo Gilligan come through, a platform is always given to local urban talent, and it's always a pleasure to see what Manchester has to offer.</p>
      <p>The first comedian to take to the stage was Aurie Styla - a London-based comedian who had the whole crowd howling with his tongue-in cheek set. </p>
      <p>Then it was time for the big act himself - Mo the Comedian. Mo approached the gig in his typical laid-back style. Impossible was the perfect choice for a comedian like Mo, as the size of the venue kept the gig intimate while allowing the audience to bounce off one another.</p>

      <p>As expected, the set consisted of Mo talking about *actual* relatable topics - and from the reception in the room, it's clear to see they went down an absolute treat.</p>
      <p>I don't want to give away too much about the show's content so I don't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but what I will say is that there was something for everyone. A highlight was Mo's hilarious take on a classic lad's night out, and the stages that come with it. It's something we've all experienced, and Mo's take on it was absolutely spot on.</p>
      <p>Event organiser, Marvin Mensah, told us he was proud of the event, and it's easy to see why. Impossible was packed out, and people were quite literally lining the walls to watch the acts. The energy in the room was electric, and despite it being a Sunday evening, it could quite easily have passed for a Saturday night - a difficult task which The Lounge team are expert at achieving.</p>
      <p>All in all it was a fantastic night, and I can't wait to see what The Lounge will have to offer in 2020. If the Christmas special is anything to go by, there are great things to come next year, so keep an eye out.</p>
