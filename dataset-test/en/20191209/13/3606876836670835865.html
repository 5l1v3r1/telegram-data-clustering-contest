        <b>The speaker is said to have left the country last night</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police have launched a manhunt for Nyeri Deputy Speaker Samuel Kariuki after he was caught on tape mercilessly beating up a young man believed to belong to a rival political camp.</p>
      <p>The dramatic incident happened on Sunday morning ahead of Deputy President William Ruto's attendance at a public event in Nyeri.</p>
      <p>The event was marred with tension and violence as some of Ruto's supporters clashed with a rival group that was believed to be loyal to Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu.</p>
      <p>Kariuki, a die hard supporter of the Deputy President, was among those conspicuously participating in the embarrassing physical confrontation.</p>
      <p>In a video that has since gone viral, Kariuki is seen beating up a young man with a rungu .</p>
      <p>The Nyeri Deputy Speaker was temporarily arrested in the Sunday melee before being released.</p>
      <p>However, on Monday, Central Regional Commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga confirmed that a warrant of arrest had been issued against Kariuki who also serves as the MCA for Ruringu'u ward.</p>
      <p>Nyagwanga added that all those involved in the Sunday violence at Giakanja Secondary School would be arrested and arraigned in court.</p>
      <p>The development came even as area MP Ngunjiri Wambugu claimed that Kariuki had left the country on Sunday night to avoid the pending arrest.</p>
      <p>"<i>Apparently the Speaker of the Nyeri County Assembly organized a trip for the Deputy Speaker to leave the country last night, so that he doesn’t get arrested. I hope the EACC &amp; the DCI to investigate how this decision to travel was reached, and who’s funds were used</i>," Wambugu said.</p>
