      <h1>Shocked Bulwell residents speak out about living on the same street as a 'deconstructed meth lab'</h1>
      <h2>Residents described the estate as 'quiet' for families</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:20:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram, Ben Reid</a></address>
      <p>Shocked residents have been left worrying for their children when emergency services discovered what appeared to be a 'deconstructed meth lab' in a "quiet" Bulwell housing estate.</p>
      <p>Police were called to a house in Potters Hollow at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/live-updates-police-say-meth-3622565">around 11.45pm on Saturday, December 7 following reports of suspicious circumstances.</a></p>
      <p>A spokesman for the force said a landlord reported that a previous tenant had left behind a number of bottled chemicals and what appeared to be a "deconstructed meth lab."</p>
      <p>The fire service discovered an "unopened bottle of an unknown liquid" and decided to set up a scene in the property for safety.</p>
      <p>Residents on the estate spoke of their shock at the scene and said the street was "quiet" area for families.</p>
      <p>Steve Baxter, 33, a personal trainer who lives on the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bulwell">Bulwell</a> estate said: "I was not expecting to hear that on a Monday morning. It's really shocking stuff.</p>
      <p>"A lot of kids live here so that's a real shame that this is happening.</p>

      <p>"You don't like seeing police all over where you live. You don't know what's been going off in that house. I've lived here around six months. It's not a good look for a nice area."</p>
      <p>Kellie Taylor, 28, who works in retail and lives on the estate.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one said: "It's awful. It's a really nice area here to be honest. That's probably why they picked it.</p>
      <p>"Of course it's really shocking. I just hope police find who is responsible. There's been police here all night. I am worried as a mum that my son is living near where <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">drugs</a> could be being made.</p>
      <p>"You hear about weed den busts but never meth really. That's really grim to hear."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Police</a> have launched an investigation, but no arrests have yet been made.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service added: “It is looking likely it is a drugs production site. No one has been evacuated (from the area) and there is no immediate danger to the public.”</p>
      <p>Chief Constable for Nottinghamshire Police, Craig Guildford, said it is “not very often” his officers come across meth labs.</p>

      <p>He told Nottinghamshire Live: “I think this is the first one we have found this year. We come across a lot of cannabis grows but in terms of meth labs that is something relatively rare as a force.</p>
      <p>“At the moment, I have not had it confirmed it is that.</p>
      <p>“I do not think there is a massive market for it, but if you look at evidence in America (where the market is bigger) we do not want to be in that situation.</p>
      <p>“It is good that we have come across it and that we are investigating it, if it does turn out to be a meth lab.</p>
      <p>“If something comes to the UK it usually starts in London and then spreads.”</p>

      <p>Sarah Dean, 30, who lives on the estate nearby, added: “I’m so shocked by that. It’s crazy to hear. It’s not a laughing matter. I don’t know who lives there but it’s a quiet area, it’s peaceful with a lot of families here.</p>
      <p>"Police were all over the street last night. It was really shocking to see and to hear about this meth lab is absolutely crazy.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea Tan, 28, who moved to Potters Hollow in the summer said: “I’m a mum-of-two. My kids are three and four. It’s worrying for me to see that. They play on this street on their bikes.</p>

      <p>"I moved here because it was a nice and quiet area. You can’t control what happens around you but it is worrying that it’s so close.”</p>
      <p>A meth lab is a laboratory used to manufacture the drug methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>Methamphetamine, a Class A drug, can come in several different forms – including tablets, powder, or crystals.</p>
      <p>The tablets are sometimes referred to as 'yaba', while the smokeable crystals are often called 'crystal meth' or 'ice.'</p>
      <p>Possession can get result in up to 5 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.</p>
      <p>Supplying someone else can get someone up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.</p>
      <p>Police are calling for anyone with information to get in touch.</p>
      <p>They can be reached on 101, quoting incident 931 of 7 December 2019.</p>
