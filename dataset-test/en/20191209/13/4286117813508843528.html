      <p>A senior female lawyer has accused Haryana state minister Anup Dhanak and his staff members of knocking at her doors twice when she was alone in the room. The incident, she has alleged, took place on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Advocate Navratan Chaudhary in a police complaint said she got scared when an unknown person knocked at her door twice.</p>
      <p>"I am a senior advocate practicing in the Supreme Court. I was in Rohtak in connection with my appointment with a dentist. I decided to halt as it was dark. Somebody tried to open my door not once, but twice. I was scared and immediately called the Circuit House officials. I was told that Haryana state ministers Anup Dhanak and his staff were also staying in the state guest house. When I called the minister, he expressed inability to do anything," she told the police.</p>
      <p>Having failed to elicit the desired response from the Circuit House staff and the minister, the lawyer dial 100 for police help. She even called a colleague for help.</p>
      <p>When contacted Anup Dhanak confirmed that he was staying in the Circuit House along with his staff but denied the involvement of his staff in the alleged harassment.</p>
      <p>"Not to my knowledge. Yes, my staff was there. If someone has a problem she should get the things investigated. When this incident took place, we were going down for dinner. She also alleged that my staff was drunk. The allegations are baseless," Anup Dhanak said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the police officials said they were investigating the case besides scanning the CCTV footage.</p>
      <p>"We have received a complaint from Navratan Choudhary who has alleged that someone knocked at the door of the room where she was staying. We are investigating the case besides scanning the CCTV footage," Gurpal Rana, DSP Rohtak said.</p>
