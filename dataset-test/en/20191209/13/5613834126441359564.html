      <h1>‘Hocus Pocus’ Returns as a ‘DOOM’ Mod</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:10:28+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>No, this isn’t about the Disney classic (though a video game adaptation would be interesting), Apogee Software’s <b><i>Hocus Pocus</i></b> is a side-scrolling DOS game released back in 1994 by Apogee Software. You controlled Hocus, a young wizard apprentice, and the goal of this game was to collect all the crystal balls within the 16 levels.</p>
      <p>So naturally, that’s just cause to create a <b><i>DOOM</i></b> mod based on the game. For the last five years, modder Ravage has been working on <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=45804"><i>Hocusdoom</i></a>, a total conversion for <b><i>DOOM 2</i></b> that transforms it into a first-person version of <i>Hocus Pocus</i>. Shoot magic at scorpions and bats, shout “Yahoo!” in the original game’s Mario-esque voice, and collect crystals while circle-strafing.</p>
      <p>Given the five years of development, this isn’t a quick and dirty mod. The graphics have been given a serious overhaul, changing the hellish landscape into the whimsical fantasy setting for <i>Hocus Pocus</i>. Hey, it’ll keep you busy until <b><i>DOOM Eternal</i></b> hits in March 2020.</p>
