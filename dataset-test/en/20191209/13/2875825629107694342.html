      <h1>Rod Stewart told to leave Loose Women on-air by wife Penny after awkward blunder</h1>
      <h2>Music legend Rod Stewart didn't realise Loose Women was live on air, when he headed to join wife Penny Lancaster and the panel</h2>

      <p>A Loose Women misunderstanding led to slightly awkward scenes for Sir Rod Stewart on Monday, as he gate-crashed the start of the show.</p>
      <p>Rod was on the daytime show to discuss what was in the pipeline, including his new Christmas music.</p>
      <p>His wife Penny Lancaster was on the panel for the day, preparing to welcome him on for his interview later on in the episode.</p>
      <p>But things got a little confusing when Rod was introduced, with him shown at the side of the studio as host Andrea McLean revealed what he was doing on the show.</p>
      <p>The guests coming up in a particular episode are often shown at the side of the stage for a few seconds, before they make their appearance later on.</p>

      <p>But Rod made a blunder live on air, as he made his way to the panel earlier than scheduled.</p>
      <p>He was seen gesturing to the crew and panel whether he needed to join them, and if they were ready for him.</p>
      <p>It appears the singer got ignored, as he slowly began walking towards the panel, greeting the audience as he went by.</p>

      <p>Penny could be heard saying he wasn't meant to be on yet, but Jane Moore and the others were quite happy to see him join them for the entire show.</p>
      <p>As he reached the desk, he was seen looking for his seat to sit down, as Penny continued to tell him he wasn't due on yet.</p>
      <p>It's then, as he took Brenda Edwards' seat, that he realised and asked what was going on - with wife Penny telling him they were live on air.</p>

      <p>Rod pulled a face as the audience laughed, with him not appearing to know he was on air, before he blamed the crew over his earlier than planned entrance.</p>
      <p>Andrea, Brenda and Jane asked him to stay, but Penny was quick to send him packing - with Rod pulling a sad face, before walking backstage.</p>
      <p>Andrea said: "Rod you're not on yet, you're peaking too early..."</p>
      <p>Penny told him: "You came on too soon darling... it's not rehearsal, it's live.</p>
      <p>"We're very happy you're here but maybe you'd like to come back later..."</p>

      <p>Viewers were divided over the hilarious moment, with many finding it super "cringe" as others saw the funny side.</p>
      <p>One fan commented: "Rod Stewart just now on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/loosewomen?src=hashtag_click">#loosewomen</a> THIRTY minutes BEFORE he was due on and NOT even realising when there was NO chair for him."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Sir Rod walking on stage earlier than he should and then having to be told they are live!"</p>
      <p>A third added: "Oh if you ever need to know what cringe is, definition was that moment right there on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/loosewomen?src=hashtag_click">#loosewomen</a> - poor guy."</p>
