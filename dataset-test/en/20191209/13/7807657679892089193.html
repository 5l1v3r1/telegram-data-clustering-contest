      <p>Microsoft's Xbox One has accumulated an impressive assortment of music services, with Spotify, Soundcloud, and Pandora all among the services with apps for the console. Despite this, Apple Music, one of the biggest players in the music streaming space, is yet to deliver a solution for gaming consoles. While official support isn't expected soon, a third-party application known as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU54271YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fstore%252Fp%252Fairserver-xbox-edition%252F9nblggh52nb8%253Frtc%253D1&amp;token=SsrzHC0l">AirServer</a> delivers relatively seamless workaround to enjoy the service with gaming. Hooking directly into AirPlay, Apple's propriety wireless streaming protocol used across its devices, Apple Music content can be remotely cast directly to Xbox One from your iPhone or iPad.</p>

      <p>Setting up AirServer on Xbox One is a relatively simple process, with no accounts or passwords to handle. Simply install the app and you'll be ready to go. Although the full version of the app is relatively expensive at <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU54271YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fstore%252Fp%252Fairserver-xbox-edition%252F9nblggh52nb8&amp;token=TuV7WH1M">$20 via the Microsoft Store</a>, its handy free trial offers a chance to decide if the app is for you.</p>

      <p>AirPlay is directly integrated into the iOS operating system, making audio and video streaming a simple process from iPhones, iPads, and other compatible devices running iOS 4.3 or higher. Taking advantage of this, AirServer essentially emulates the receiving capabilities of an Apple TV. Although AirServer recommends using its "AirServer Connect" application to eliminate initial discoverability issues, following an initial setup, connecting and disconnecting is a relatively seamless.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <b>App Store</b> on your iOS device.</li>
        <li>Select the <b>Search</b> tab.</li>
        <li>Type <b>AirServer Connect</b> using the on-screen keyboard.</li>
        <li><b>Install <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/airserver-connect/id967004087?at=10l3Vy&amp;ct=UUwpUdUnU54271YYw">AirServer Connect</a></b>.</li>
        <li><b>Open AirServer Connect</b>.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Scan QR Code</b>.</li>
        <li>Allow <b>camera access</b> once prompted.</li>
        <li>Scan the <b>QR Code</b> on the Xbox One app. This will ensure your Xbox One is discovered as an AirPlay device and quickly pair the two devices.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Following a successful pairing, your Xbox One can now recieve video and audio from your iOS device.</p>
      <h3>How to play Apple Music on Xbox One with AirServer</h3>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>After establishing a connection between your Xbox One and iOS device via AirServer, you'll now be ready to play Apple Music tracks through your console. With support for background audio, the Xbox One's feature that allows music to play while gaming, you won't need to leave AirServer running to enjoy your music.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <b>Music</b> app on your iOS device.</li>
        <li>Find a <b>song</b> to play.</li>
        <li>Press the <b>AirPlay icon</b> at the bottom of the playback screen, represented by an upwards facing arrow and three rings.</li>
        <li>Select <b>XboxOne 1080p 30</b> to establish the connection. Apple Music will begin streaming to your Xbox One.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once connected, audio playback, including volume controls and track selection, can be handled by your iOS device. Alternatively, playing, pausing, skipping and volume levels are all accessible using the Xbox One's background audio controls on the Guide menu.</p>
      <p>While these steps specifically target Apple Music, AirServer supports remote broadcasting from a majority of music and video apps. Screen-mirroring over AirPlay even allows games and other content to be directly captured from your phone and outputted via your Xbox One. While the app might not be cheap, this is a great solution for those heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.</p>

      <h3>About the Apple Music web app</h3>

      <p>Recently Apple launched a web app for the Apple Music service and, for the most part, it's very good. It's certainly a more elegant way to listen to your playlists at the computer than iTunes for Windows.</p>
      <p>Since the Xbox One has a built-in web browser you might be hoping that it'd be an easy, free way to listen to your music through your console. Alas, that's not the case, at least not right now. Technically Apple Music for the web is in beta, but whether the problem is Apple, Microsoft, or a combination of both, it just doesn't work.</p>
      <p>You can log in and see music, albeit after an excruciatingly long wait for everything to load properly. Actually playing music seems a step too far. It might work in the future, who knows, but right now, it's one to steer clear of.</p>
