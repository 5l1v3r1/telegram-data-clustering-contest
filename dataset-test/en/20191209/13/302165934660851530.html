      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 9 — A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) company will be set up to carry out the Kampung Baru redevelopment project, the Dewan Negara was told today.</p>

      <p>“The SPV will act as the master developer to develop the 219.91 acres of the Malay Agricultural Settlement area,” he said during the question-and-answer session.</p>
      <p>He said this in reply to a question from senator Dr Yaakob Sapari who wanted to know about the developer of the Kampung Baru redevelopment project.</p>
      <p>Khalid said in order to safeguard the interests of the landowners, the government, which would lead the SPV would ensure the company was managed by experts and experienced personnel.</p>
      <p>He said the ministry and the Kampung Baru Development Corporation were in the midst of having discussions with government agencies and government-linked companies to develop the best model to be used in formulating the Kampung Baru development plan.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Khalid said the government would also ensure that the viability of the SPV in order to achieve the goal of making Kampung Baru a prime area equipped with complete facilities but at the same time preserving the existing Malay cultural elements. — Bernama</p>
