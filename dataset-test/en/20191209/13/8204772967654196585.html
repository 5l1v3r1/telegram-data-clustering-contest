      <p>A 20-year-old man has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to murdering a Japanese national in Dundalk nearly two years ago.</p>

      <p>Wearing a white shirt and black suit, Mr Morei stood up when arraigned before the Central Criminal Court.</p>
      <p>When the registrar read the indictment to the accused and asked him how he was pleading, he replied: “Not guilty by reason of insanity”.</p>
