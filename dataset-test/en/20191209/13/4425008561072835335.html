      <h1>Govts agree on national API standards</h1>
      <h2>To keep IT systems interoperable.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:47:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/justin-hendry-1167397" target="_blank">Justin Hendry</a></address>
      <p>Commonwealth, state and territory IT ministers have agreed to a set of national application programming interface (API) design standards to promote interoperability between IT systems.</p>
      <p>The decision, taken at the fifth meeting of the Australian Digital and Data Council in Sydney on Friday, aims to ensure APIs are consistent between all levels of government.</p>
      <p>The standards will allow governments, as well as “trusted” third-parties, to “securely share, re-use and enhance data in real-time”.</p>
      <p>“The national API design standards create a common method of API development that all governments can adopt,” the ministers said in a <a href="https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/addc-communique-6-december-2019.pdf">communique</a> following the meeting.</p>
      <p>“This will create consistency between governments and promote interoperability between jurisdictions’ IT systems.</p>
      <p>“Governments across Australia will be able to develop services more efficiently, learning from each other and, where needed, have services that work well across jurisdictions.”</p>
      <p>Ministers approved the creation of the standards at an April 2019 meeting of the council and tasked the Digital Transformation Agency with prioritising their development.</p>
      <p>The standards were to build on the API standards work of other jurisdictions to date, particularly Victoria which has had a <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/victoria-unlocks-govt-data-with-api-gateway-523914">whole-of-government API portal</a> since April.</p>
      <p>The DTA first identified the need for interoperability standards, including those for APIs, in December 2018 as part of its <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/agencies-to-take-charge-of-govt-wide-platforms-516869">digital services platform strategy</a> to enable like up new and existing systems.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://api.gov.au/standards/national_api_standards/">national API design standards</a> (NAPIDS), which have been developed using a co-design model led by the DTA and the Victorian government, are intended to be used to as best practices guides when developers are building APIs.</p>
      <p>“The NAPIDS enable developers building APIs to move past common decision points by referencing pre-agreed, best practice design patterns and implementing their APIs according to these standards,” the government’s api.gov.au hub states.</p>
      <p>The standards separate APIs into three categories: system level APIs, process level APIs and experience level APIs, each of which has differing requirements.</p>
      <p>Experience level APIs or “APIs intended to ease the adoption of API integration between and organisation and its external consumers”, for instance, requires that the design standards be applied.</p>
      <p>The standards also replace the DTA's plan for a data exchange platform, which CEO Randal Brugeaud has previously said was <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/can-a-govt-wide-open-source-messaging-platform-really-cost-just-150k-533115">dumped after the discovery process</a> "determined that a discrete data exchange was not the best way to do it".</p>
      <p>A bare-bones version of the government’s API catalogue is similarly contained on api.gov.au, with five APIs, including from the ATO and Australian Bureau of Statistics, listed.</p>
