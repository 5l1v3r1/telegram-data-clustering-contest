      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:50:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Amazon.in on Monday said it is focusing on three areas -- vernacular, voice and video -- to help merchants connect better with customers and increase their sales.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/amazon-india">Amazon India </a>Vice President Seller Services Gopal Pillai said its seller base in the country has grown to over 5.5 lakh, and the company continues to work on a number of initiatives to bring more small and medium businesses on its platform.</p>
      <p>"We continue to focus on 3 Vs - vernacular, voice and videos to help sellers. We provide support in five <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vernacular">vernacular </a>languages for them, and are working on growing that," he said without disclosing more details.</p>
      <p>Amazon.in is locked in a bruising battle for market leadership in India against Walmart-backed Flipkart, which is also working on bringing more small and medium businesses on its platform.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, Walmart announced that it will open 25 institute hubs in India over the next five years.</p>
      <p>These hubs will train 50,000 entrepreneurs from the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector and are part of Walmart's "long-term commitment to India", Walmart International President and CEO Judith McKenna said.</p>
      <p>Talking about the company's plan, Pillai said it is organising Small Business Day on December 14.</p>
      <p>"The event will see participation from thousands of manufacturers, small brand owners, start-ups, artisans, and weavers and will encourage shoppers to discover and buy unique and hard-to-find products offered by small businesses and micro entrepreneurs," he said.</p>
      <p>The specially curated online event will offer customers the opportunity to discover and purchase products under its various programs such as Amazon Launchpad, Amazon Saheli, Amazon Karigar and others.</p>
      <p>Amazon also announced its partnership with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cii">CII </a>to conduct awareness workshops and training in pre-identified locations to enable small and medium businesses start their e-commerce journey.</p>
      <p>Pillai said Amazon and the industry body will conduct various activities, including a series of awareness workshops, road shows, and e-commerce training, among other initiatives.</p>
      <p>These workshops will be held across India, focused on domestic <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/msmes">MSMEs </a>and potential exporters with a view to sensitise these <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/msmes">MSMEs </a>on the potential of enhancing market access by leveraging Amazon's global marketplace, he added.</p>
      <p>"E-commerce has played a significant role by lowering entrance costs and barriers to help <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/msmes">MSMEs </a>engage in international trade and Global Value Chains (GVC). The inclusiveness of GVC could be greatly enhanced by expanding and extending the benefits of e-commerce platforms to Indian MSMEs," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cii">CII </a>Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cii">CII </a>and Amazon agreed to start with a series of workshops in five cities in identified MSME clusters of leather &amp; footwear, apparels and textiles, automobile, cycle parts and handicrafts, he added.</p>
      <p>The workshops will aim to raise awareness about e-commerce, and focus on how MSMEs can leverage e-commerce for their success, particularly for B2C (business-to-consumer) exports, he noted.</p>
