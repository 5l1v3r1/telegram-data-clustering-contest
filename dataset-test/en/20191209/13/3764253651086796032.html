      <p>One of the only ways to save Nigeria's democracy from threats is for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to adopt presidential candidates from the south east zone, Osita Okechukwu, an appointee of President Muhammadu Buhari, has said.</p>
      <p>Okechukwu, a chieftain of the APC, reportedly said this on Sunday, December 8, while speaking with journalists concerning the 2023 presidential election.</p>
      <p>PM NEWS quotes the director-general of the Voice of Nigeria (VON) as saying an Igbo president in 2023 would help stop the tension that characterises such polls in the country and ensure the needed peace.</p>
      <p>According to him, the PDP and the APC should adopt the strategy of political parties in 1998 which led to the adoption of <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/348-olusegun-obasanjo.html">Olusegun Obasanjo</a> and Olu Falae as presidential candidates.</p>
      <p>He argued that apart from ensuring a peaceful election in 2023, the adoption of Igbos as dominant candidates would give an added impetus to needed unity of the country.</p>
      <p>He said even though he respects people like former vice president, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/1435-atiku-abubakar.html">Atiku Abubakar</a>, the national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and others angling to be president, they should also know that Nigeria is bigger than individual aspirations.</p>
      <p>He specifically noted that Tinubu was the biggest contributor to the emergence of Buhari in 2015.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Falae/Obasanjo model was founded in 1999, on equity, natural justice, and good conscience, with the sole objective of a harmonious and peaceful country.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"We may recall that in 1999, two Yorubas were fielded by national consensus under PDP and AD/APP alliance. That was the genesis of rotation of president between north and south,"</i> he argued.</p>
      <p>While noting that the Yoruba presidency was done because of the need for peace and unity, he added: <i>“We need that now more than ever, especially now that Mr President had denounced those fifth columnists who bandied third term."</i></p>

      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported how a former chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, recently asked all lovers of equity and justice <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278095-2023-itll-unfair-deny-igbo-presidency-ohuabunwa.html">to rally round the Igbo ahead of 2023</a>.</p>
      <p>Ohuabunwa described those who are opposed to a president of Igbo extraction in 2023 as selfish individuals, who only want to cause confusion and create a greater division, enmity and unhappiness.</p>
