      <p>Cape Town - The <b>ITU (International Triathlon Union) World Cup</b> will <b>not</b> return to <b>Cape Town</b> in 2020.</p>
      <p>The event, which was scheduled to take place in February 2020, has been postponed to 2021 due to lack of sponsorship.</p>
      <p>Discovery were the headline sponsors in recent years.</p>
      <p>"Despite our best efforts and close collaboration with the International Triathlon Union and Triathlon South Africa to secure a new title sponsor after our contract with the event title sponsor had come to an end in 2019, the tough economic climate was simply too big a challenge to overcome," says race director Gary Marescia of World Sport South Africa.</p>
      <p>"While we are disappointed we cannot bring this world-class event to Africa, South Africa and the Mother City for the seventh year, we are already putting renewed energy into finding a new event partner for 2021."</p>
      <p>The ITU Triathlon World Cup Cape Town has been a popular fixture on the Cape Town triathlon scene over the past six years.</p>
      <p>It served as the official ITU World Cup and global calendar season opener to the world's best triathletes, and saw over 2 000 triathletes participate in a series of short-course races on an annual basis.</p>
      <p>2019 also marked the successful introduction of the African Junior Challenge, attracting the continent's top junior triathletes.</p>
      <p>The event's return in 2021 will have further significance, as it will support the ITU Science and Sport Conference, which was awarded to Cape Town at the end of 2018.</p>
