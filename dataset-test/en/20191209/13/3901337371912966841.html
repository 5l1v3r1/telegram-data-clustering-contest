      <p>Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has said what was needed during half-time while 3-2 down against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday, was a frank discussion about the team’s mentality at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi were eventual 5-3 winners at the weekend, but their defensive frailties had been exposed in the first half, forcing Middendorp to have a stern word.</p>

      <p>“Controlled aggressiveness is one important aspect of the game. I said it at the beginning of the season that we want to see our team more aggressive compared to the past six months in the last season,” the coach told reporters.  </p>
      <p>“Of course I tried to find some words, a way to communicate this to the players and that is what we have done. We found a way by communicating with each other at half-time and we had the controlled aggressiveness in the second half. It was what was needed to get the result at the end of the day.” </p>
      <p>Middendorp said the game was value for money for neutrals at the stadium, but had criticised his side for a defensive display that was worse than an u/12 league. </p>
      <p>“Very entertaining game, no doubt about it. It means the two teams were contributing and for the supporters it was a pleasure. We had a bit of an attitude issue in the first half, which allowed some quick counter. We corrected it somehow in the second half and were more results-driven in our performance in the second half,” he said.</p>
