      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news includes Millwall boss Gary Rowett full of praise for Jed Wallace amid reports linking winger with AVFC</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:11:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Jed Wallace’s performance for Millwall against Nottingham Forest was ‘as good’ as anything his manager Gary Rowett has ever seen in the Championship.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-jed-wallace-17348418">Aston Villa have been linked with a January deal for the winger</a> who is believed to be valued at around £10m.</p>
      <p>Reports in the national press have claimed <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> have scouted Wallace this season and representatives from any club would have been impressed with what they saw on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> player was a thorn in the side of the Forest defence, especially in the first-half and set up Millwall’s opening goal in the 2-2 draw to claim his eighth assist of the season.</p>

      <p>Rowett was full of praise for him afterwards, telling <a href="https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/gary-rowett-heaps-praise-on-millwalls-jed-wallace-after-first-half-performance-against-nottingham-forest/">London News Online:</a> “The second goal came after we changed shape a little bit to get Jed in the middle. He knows that you can’t over-play in that area, take those risks in that area.</p>
      <p>“His first-half display as absolutely brilliant, it’s as good a 45 minutes as I’ve seen anyone in the Championship play. I’ve got to accept that occasionally he might make some of those decisions, trying to do the right thing, and I don’t want to stifle his creativity.</p>
      <p>“He’s got to get better at when and where he does it, but I’ve got to accept it a little bit because of his brilliance up the pitch.”</p>
      <p>Wallace, who spent two seasons at Wolves before being sold to Millwall in 2017, was recently asked about his future with January just around the corner.</p>
      <p>“I’ll keep doing what I’m doing now, play every week," he said. I’ve signed here three times, people know how committed I am to Millwall.</p>
      <p>“Whether I play good, bad or indifferent I think the reason the fans respect me is because I leave it all out on the pitch every game. I try my hardest.</p>
