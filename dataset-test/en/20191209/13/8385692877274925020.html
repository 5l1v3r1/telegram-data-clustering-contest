      <p>Today only, Amazon is selling Anker charging accessories for up to 40% off of their regular price. As part of its Gold Box Deal of the Day. Making it a great time to save big on some battery packs, USB-C cables, wall chargers and so much more. These are going to make for some great stocking stuffers this year.</p>
      <p>This is another really good deal for some stocking stuffers, or just picking up some stuff you need anyways. Amazon is discounting products from Oral B, Crest, Braun and Pantene today, up to 30% off. This includes razors, trimmers, electric toothbrushes and so much more. All part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day.</p>
      <p>Amazon is also taking up to 30% off of Dash Air Fryers today, allowing you to get one for as cheap as $69.99. These are going to allow you to fry food in a more healthy manner. Since you're not putting it in a ton of oil to fry them, you're just using, well air. Air fried french fries still taste really good using the Dash Air Fryers, so definitely a good Christmas gift.</p>

      <p>Amazon has discounted the iRobot Roomba i7 (7150) Robot Vacuum today, allowing you to pick it up for just $499. Saving you $200 on its regular price. Now it's important to point out that this is the regular Roomba i7 and not the i7+. Which means that this does not come with the self-emptying base. So keep that in mind before purchasing.</p>
      <p>Now that Cyber Monday and Black Friday are over, most of the really big deals are done. But retailers are still offering up some really good prices on different products, so you can still get your holiday shopping done. Since the majority of us weren't able to finish it during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend.
