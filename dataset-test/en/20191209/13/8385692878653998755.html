      <p>Today only, Amazon is discounting a number of Anker's most popular charging accessories, as part of its Deal of the Day. Allowing you to save big on plenty of stocking stuffer gifts.</p>
      <p>Remember that this is part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, so these prices are only going to be good until midnight PST tonight. After that, they will return to their regular prices.</p>
      <p>Included in this deal is the Anker PowerCore 10000, which is just $17.49. This is one of the smallest battery packs out there, that sports at least 10,000mAh. That makes this a great battery pack to travel with since it's small and lightweight and can still charge your smartphone a few times while you're on the go.</p>

      <p>There's also the PowerWave Stand, which is available in a two-pack for just $27.99. If you, or someone on your holiday list just got a phone that supports wireless charging, this is going to make for a great gift.</p>
      <p>Moving to the car, the Anker PowerDrive Speed 2 is on sale for just $14.99, good for $11 off of its regular price. This is a dual-port USB-A car charger that does PowerIQ Technology, for some fast charging, as well as Quick Charge 3.0. And since most phones support that now, this becomes a really great car charger to pick up and use.</p>
      <p>Then we have Anker's 100W four-USB port charging station. We're looking at a price of $69.99 here, taking $30 off of its regular price. This includes two USB-C PD charging ports, that are powerful enough to charge a laptop. Along with two USB-A charging ports that support PowerIQ Technology too. This is going to make a really great charging station for a desk.</p>
