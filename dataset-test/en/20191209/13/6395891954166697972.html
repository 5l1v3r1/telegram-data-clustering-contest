      <p><b>ROMEÂ (AP)</b> - Prosecutors in Sicily are investigating suspected embezzlement by a mysterious Maltese academic who has been linked to a U.S. probe of hacked emails.</p>
      <p>Agrigento Prosecutor Salvatore Vella said by telephone Monday that his office is investigating Joseph Mifsud for suspected embezzlement of at least 100,000 euros ($110,000) in connection with his role at a local public university.</p>
      <p>Mifsud apparently disappeared in 2017. Vella says his office, which needs to formally notify the professor that he is under investigation, hasn't been able so far to locate him.</p>
      <p>U.S. prosecutors have alleged that a campaign adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump had learned from Mifsud about stolen emails that figured in the FBI's probe into alleged hacking by Russia.</p>
      <p>Last year, in a separate probe in Sicily, a Palermo-based auditors' court ordered Mifsud to return nearly 50,000 euros in over payments in connection with his university role.</p>
