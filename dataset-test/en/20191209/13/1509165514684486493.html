      <p>According to a report from NFL Network, Jones could be forced to miss the next two to four games, which could leave him sidelined for the remainder of the season because the Giants only have four games remaining.</p>
      <p>The timing of Monday’s report is interesting on many fronts.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, as Jones was walking out of the Giants’ indoor facility after practice -- without a walking boot for the first time all week -- head coach <a href="https://www.nj.com/jets/2019/12/nfl-hot-seat-rankings-week-15-cowboys-jason-garrett-giants-pat-shurmur-lions-matt-patricia-all-getting-fired-like-panthers-ron-rivera.html">Pat Shurmur </a>revealed that he had no plans of playing veteran <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2019/12/nfl-picks-predictions-for-new-york-giants-vs-philadelphia-eagles-can-eli-manning-play-spoiler-to-nfc-east-foe-nfl-week-14.html">Eli Manning </a>again this season, had Jones not been injured.</p>

      <p>Then, Jones was spotted by reports during the open portion of Saturday’s practice sans walking boot participating in the individual drills.</p>
      <p>If Jones is forced out of action for Week 15 against the Miami Dolphins, it will give ownership and Giants fans one more chance to see Manning take the field at MetLife Stadium. The 38-year-old is in the final year of his contract and unlikely to return to the team next season.</p>

      <p>Jones played through the entire second half of last week’s 31-13 loss to the Green Bay Packers after initially getting injured and while at Duke didn’t just play through a high-ankle sprain, but was kept out of action for only three weeks due to a broken clavicle.</p>

      <p>“I think they’re good,” Jones said last week of his chances to play again this season. “I think every day since, I’ve been feeling better and I think it should heal up pretty quickly.”</p>
