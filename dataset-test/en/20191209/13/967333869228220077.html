      <p>Israeli police have increased their presence in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Isawiyah since the end of June following violent clashes with local residents. The incidents were provoked by the death of a young Palestinian man, who was shot dead by a policeman after he launched fireworks at the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201912081077514756-israeli-forces-arrest-palestinian-woman-after-attempted-stabbing-attack-in-hebron---police/">officers during clashes</a> in the neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>With regard to such incidents, the authorities usually suspect ultra-right Jewish activists. Muslim and Christian sites in Israel, East Jerusalem and the West Bank; the property of Palestinians and Israeli Arabs; and even Israeli army bases have repeatedly been targeted in acts of vandalism.</p>
