      <p><b>Lahore</b><b>: </b>Former Pakistan skipper and wicketkeeper Rashid Latif has slammed the country’s national cricket board over the players’ age fudging controversy. In a tweet, Latif urged the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to refrain from making a joke of itself.</p>
      <p>In the Green Brigade’s recent concluded Test series against Australia, Naseem Shah, 16, made his debut for the senior team before he was selected into the Pakistan U-19 team for the Youth World Cup last week.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, the 51-year-old wrote: “Pakistani Cricket Team’s players are going to U-19s. U-19s are going to U-16s, U-16s to U-13s &amp; U-13s back to their mothers’ laps. For God’s sake PCB, correct the ages &amp; don’t destroy (your reputation) by working with crooked diploma doctors, don’t make a joke of yourself.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Pakistan opener and ex-chief selector Mohsin Khan also raised his voice over Shah’s selection in the U-19 squad. IANS</p>
