      <h1>Strictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse's own relationship 'curse'</h1>
      <h2>She left her husband for a dancer on another show</h2>

      <p>Judge Motsi Mabuse has admitted that she understands the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> 'curse' as she has experienced it herself.</p>
      <p>Over the years, fans of the hit BBC dancing competition have come to believe the show is beset by a curse that breaks up couples as the dancers fall for one another.</p>
      <p>And it seems Motsi, who joined the show earlier this year as a replacement for <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/shirley-ballas-hints-darcey-bussell-quit-strictly-didnt-want-to-dance/">former judge Darcey Bussell</a>, isn't impervious.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 38-year-old married her first husband, Timo Kulczak, when she was 22.</p>
      <p>But after 11 years of marriage, the couple split and Motsi moved on with her dancing partner, Ukranian Evgenij Voznyvk, whom she married in 2007.</p>
      <p>Before joining the UK version of Strictly, Motsi served as a professional and then judge on the German version.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a>, the former pro said of finding romance with Evgenij: "Three years later, whoosh! And then I was married."</p>
      <p>In 2013, the pair won the German Latin American title and retired with a final Rumba on the German Strictly.</p>
      <aside>If you work in this sort of world, adult things happen.</aside>
      <p>But after they stopped dancing together, Motsi came to realise there was more between them.</p>
      <p>She explained: "We stopped and it was then that we realised that we wanted to do more than just dance together."</p>
      <p>Admitting that she understands how romance can develop between dancing partners, Motsi confessed: "You know, if you work in this sort of world, adult things happen. Everyone goes for a drink and, whoops-a-daisy!"</p>
      <p>Motsi and Evgenij now have a 15-month-old daughter together.</p>

      <p>There have been numerous examples of pro dancers and celebrity contestants finding romance or breaking up with their partners shortly after being on Strictly.</p>
      <p>Countdown star Rachel Riley fell in love with Pasha Kovalev after they were paired up in the 2013 series, and the couple are <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/pregnant-rachel-riley-reveals-her-parenting-fears/">now expecting their first child</a>.</p>
      <p>And in last year's series, comedian Seann Walsh was pictured kissing his pro partner Katya Jones, whose <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-katya-jones-announces-split-from-neil/">marriage with fellow pro Neil Jones ended shortly after</a>.</p>

      <p>Similarly, presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/susanna-reid/">Susanna Reid</a> competed in series 11 in 2013, at which time she was 15 years into a relationship with partner Dominic Cotton.</p>
      <p>They broke up shortly after she appeared on the show although, although the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">GMB</a> host insisted the programme wasn't to blame, telling the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/susanna-reids-love-split-anguish-3459120">Mirror</a> at the time: "It wasn't [because of Strictly]. Obviously things have been challenging in my personal life but we are getting things sorted."</p>
