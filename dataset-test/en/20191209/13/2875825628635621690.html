      <p>Rosanna Davison has revealed how she and her husband named baby Sophia after a stunning cathedral in Kiev.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rosanna-davison">The model</a> and her husband <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wesley-quirke">Wes Quirke</a> welcomed their <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/irish-showbiz/rosanna-davison-baby-birth-name-20930217">adorable daughter via a surrogate last month.</a></p>
      <p>The family has returned home from Ukraine after their new arrival was born just over two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>In July, the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin-born</a> model announced she was expecting her first child via gestational surrogate and bravely opened up about suffering several miscarriages in the past.</p>

      <p>The pair jetted to Kiev for the retrieval process earlier this year and staying beside to city's St Sophia’s Cathedral inspired their choice of name, RSVP Live reports.</p>
      <p>Rosanna told her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers: "Back when we began the medical and legal side of Our Surrogacy Journey in February 2018, we never dreamed that we would be lucky enough to take our beautiful daughter home for Christmas the very next year.</p>
      <p>"It is a long, stressful, expensive process and there are no absolute guarantees.</p>
      <p>"At the beginning of this year, we spent a few weeks in Kiev for the egg retrieval process and stayed beside St Sophia’s Cathedral.</p>
      <p>"The night before my procedure, we walked up to the cathedral in the freezing cold... We both loved the name and agreed that if we happened to have a baby girl we would name her Sophia as a nod to our long journey to become her parents!"</p>

      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/miss-world">Miss World</a> told how little Sophia has spent most of her time meeting relatives since returning home.</p>
      <p>She said: "She has settled in really well and has been getting to know her grandparents and furry big brothers.</p>
      <p>"[We are] in a magical baby bubble at the most wonderful time of the year."</p>
      <p>She went on to thank her close friends and family who were there for them during their tough but special journey.</p>
      <p>"We will be forever grateful to the many people who have supported, guided and helped us over the last couple of years - you know who you are," she added.</p>
