      <h1>Popular country pub The Battleaxes given a zero food hygiene rating</h1>
      <h2>The new owners are working to make improvements</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:21:44+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Heather Pickstock</a></address>
      <p>An historic North Somerset pub, built as part of a sprawling Gothic estate, has been given a zero food hygiene rating.</p>
      <p>North Somerset Council environmental health officers inspected the Battleaxes in Wraxall last month, telling operators 'major improvements' were needed.</p>
      <p>Pub operators – the Country Pub Group – have been told ‘major improvement’ is needed to its food handling procedures and the management of food safety</p>
      <p>It has also been told to improve the cleanliness and condition of the facilities and the building.</p>
      <p>The owners, who purchased the pub in August, are now working with North Somerset Council to bring forward the necessary improvements.</p>
      <p>Environmental health officers (EHO) are expected to revisit the pub this week.</p>
      <p>Matthew Lowe of the Country Pub Group said the poor rating was as a result of some structural issues which had been remedied.</p>
      <p>He added issues with paperwork had arisen as a result of food safety system used by the former operators being phased out and replaced with new procedures used by the Country Pub Group.</p>
      <h3>'We believe the kitchen is of a good level'</h3>
      <p>Mr Lowe said: “Following instruction from EHO we are working closely to improve our rating.</p>
      <p>“A lot of structural issues were identified such as needing to replace some flooring and painting of walls which we have now completed.</p>
      <p>“We are always working with EHO to improve our record keeping and paperwork.</p>
      <p>“We believe the kitchen is of a good level and if EHO thought it was unsafe they would have shut it down.</p>
      <p>“We would also like to welcome any customers into the kitchen at any time to see for themselves.”</p>
      <p>The Country Pub Group, owned by hospitality entrepreneur Mr Lowe, purchased The Battleaxes from the Flatcappers chain in August.</p>
      <p>The group has three other pubs – two of which have a five-star food hygiene ratings and one of which has a four-star rating.</p>
      <p>The purchase of the Battleaxes by the group has created nine new jobs and seen a major supply chain move from national to local suppliers, pumping additional cash into the local economy.</p>
      <p>Mr Lowe said the EHO visit will not affect any bookings. A revamp of the menu is also planned in January.</p>
      <p>As well as a bar and large restaurant and function room, the Battleaxes also boasts boutique hotel rooms and a small basement bar called The Shindig.</p>
      <h3>The history of the pub</h3>
      <p>The Battleaxes – which is a popular venue for wedding parties and Sunday lunches - was built as a Temperance house by the benevolent Matilda Blanche Gibbs, widow of wealthy merchant William Gibbs, in 1881.</p>
      <p>She wanted the Victorian building as somewhere for estate workers to meet without drinking alcohol.</p>
      <p>But at the outbreak of World War I the Temperance House was leased to Georges Brewery, later Courage Brewery.</p>
      <p>When Courage’s gave back the lease to the late Lord Wraxall (Richard Gibbs) in the 1960s he promptly sold the building.</p>
      <p>Changes in ownership and name followed with reports of a fire in the 1970s. Success varied but a brief spell as an Indian restaurant didn’t suit the locals.</p>
