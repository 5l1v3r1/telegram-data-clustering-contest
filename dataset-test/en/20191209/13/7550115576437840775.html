        <b>Liverpool prepared for their <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> game with Salzburg with a training session at Melwood in front of the cameras.</b>

      <p>A make-or-break tie in Austria sees the Reds needing a draw to guarantee progression, while a win would seal top spot in the group.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> would love to have his entire squad available for such a crucial encounter, but the Reds are without <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joel-matip/">Joel Matip</a> for the entirety of the Christmas fixture list.</p>

      <p>A couple of injury scares at the weekend added to that concern, but <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/dejan-lovren/">Dejan Lovren</a>—who went off in the first half—and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a>—who missed the game entirely—were both in training with the squad at Melwood on Monday afternoon.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/adam-lallana/">Adam Lallana</a>, who also missed the trip to Dean Court, seemed to train apart from the main group, however, making it unlikely he features in the squad in Austria.</p>

      <p>To boost numbers, five young players were involved, all of who could feature in the UEFA Youth League match rather than the senior squad on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>If there are any doubts over Lovren’s fitness, Neco Williams or <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sepp-van-den-berg/">Sepp van den Berg</a> are the likely candidates to step in, while <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/curtis-jones/">Curtis Jones</a> could again win a place in the matchday squad due to Lallana’s probable absence.</p>

      <p>Klopp will have a decision to make in midfield, too, where <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a> is expected to return.</p>
      <p>Recent impressive performances have also come from squad players including <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/xherdan-shaqiri/">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a>, increasing the options for the boss to turn to.</p>

      <p>And then there is the question of whether to reunite the front three of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a>, or whether <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/divock-origi/">Divock Origi</a> has done enough to push his own claim for a second start in three fixtures, after each of the four have been rested across the last two league games.</p>

      <p>The Reds beat Salzburg 4-3 at Anfield earlier in the season and have been in scintillating form recently, with comfortable wins recorded over <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/everton">Everton</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>—with a welcome clean sheet coming in the latter.</p>
      <p>One more win on Tuesday, and the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> can take a back seat until the new year.</p>
