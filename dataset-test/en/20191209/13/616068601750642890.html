      <p>The Penticton RCMP is warning the public about a new phone scam taking place within the South Okanagan. </p>
      <p>The cell phone “port-out” scam sees scammers gather as much information as possible about a target. The crook then uses the information to contact your mobile provider and requested your number be ported over to a new phone. </p>
      <p>“Once they have the number ported over to a new device, they are able to gain access to internet accounts which require a text to phone code for verification,” said Const. James Grandy. </p>
      <p>“This text is often referred to as ‘two-factor authentication,’ and is increasingly being used by online banking to keep accounts secure.”</p>
      <p>Tips to protect yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask your mobile phone provider to set up a unique pin code to prevent porting without your authorization.</li>
        <li>Watch out for your cell phone disconnecting from cell service.</li>
        <li>Be careful of texts and emails you receive which request information from you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you become a victim of this kind of scam, please report it to your local RCMP Detachment.</p>
