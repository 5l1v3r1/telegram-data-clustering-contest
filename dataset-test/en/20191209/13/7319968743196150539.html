        <b>“I may be Irish but I’m not stupid.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is well known for his off-the-cuff remarks and slips of the tongue, recently made a controversial comment about his Irish heritage.</p>
      <p>The Irish American 2020 Democrat candidate reportedly made the cringe-worthy remark to a crowd in Iowa, <a href="https://www.joe.ie/politics/joe-biden-tells-audience-may-irish-im-not-stupid-688643">JOE.ie reports</a>.</p>

      <p>According to John Mulholland, Editor of The Guardian US, Biden told the audience: "I may be Irish, but I'm not stupid." </p>
      <p>Mulholland, who is originally from Dublin, noted in his tweet: "Wonder what Irish people (like me) would make of that."</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, it’s not the first time Biden has committed this verbal gaffe. He made the same exact comment while speaking to Senator Lindsey Graham in 2015.</p>

      <p>Biden, who can trace his Irish roots back to Louth and Derry on his mother’s side and also has Irish lineage on his father’s side, has previously made <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/presidential-candidate-joe-biden-irish-roots-success">comments expressing pride in his Irish heritage.</a></p>
      <p>The 77-year-old Irish American has adopted the slogan “No Malarkey!” for his campaign. The word malarkey, meaning “nonsense”, is thought to be of Irish origin but etymologists disagree on its true origin.</p>
