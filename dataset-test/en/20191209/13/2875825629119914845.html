      <h1>Penny Lancaster forced to Google Rod Stewart's age after mixing him up with her dad</h1>
      <h2>Loose Women star Penny Lancaster was joined by husband Rod Stewart on the show on Monday, but things got pretty awkward</h2>

      <p>Rod Stewart was left unimpressed with his Loose Women panellist wife Penny Lancaster on Monday, as she got his age wrong.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, she got him mixed up with her father as she told him he'd made a mistake when telling the Loose ladies how old he was.</p>
      <p>Rod was sharing his gratitude to still be singing at the age of 74, with fans as loud as ever at his shows.</p>
      <p>But as Rod opened up to Jane Moore, Andrea McLean and Brenda Edwards, Penny interrupted him to reveal he'd made a mistake.</p>
      <p>Believing he'd forgotten his own age, Penny advised him he was almost 76 in super hilarious yet awkward scenes.</p>

      <p>But she was then forced to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/google">Google</a> search her own husband's age live on air, after realising it was actually her who was in the wrong.</p>
      <p>Rod had said: "I'm sitting there thinking you know, I'm 74..."</p>
      <p>Penny quickly said, leaving the audience in hysterics: "Darling, you're 75... you're 76 in January."</p>

      <p>Rod quickly shouted back: "No I'm not, shut up... no I'm not, I'm 74 now..."</p>
      <p>Penny then realised she'd actually got her husband mixed up with her dad, who is a year older than him.</p>
      <p>She quickly hugged him, telling him: "Oh maybe I'm talking about my dad, cos he's one year older!</p>
      <p>"Sorry, my mistake, we all make mistakes darling, sorry."</p>

      <p>She then Googled how old her husband was for clarification, with Andrea in hysterics telling the panel: "She's literally Googled how old is Rod Stewart, and he's right."</p>
      <p>This wasn't the only mistake during the interview, as Rod was left swearing when he made a blunder with the auto cue.</p>
      <p>As he said "roll VT" which wasn't supposed to be read out, he was shown saying: "Oh s**t."</p>
      <p>Andrea was quick to apologise to fans at the end of the show, blaming it on him being "a rockstar".</p>
