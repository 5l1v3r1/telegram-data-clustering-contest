      <p>When it comes to Christmas, do you love to slip into PJs, snuggle up on the couch covered in a comfy blanket and sip on a hot mug of choco?</p>
      <p>We do, and for us that means Christmas movie time, and there are some festive humdingers to check out (for possibly the millionth time).</p>
      <p>Here's our pick of the bunch.</p>
      <h3>New</h3>
      <p><b>A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby</b><br/>Wait, before you head into this absolutely jolly Christmas flick, you have to watch the other two first. Well, if you can get through how cheesy they are, but what’s a festive flick without a bit of corniness? Amber and Richard must renew a sacred truce, but the treaty disappears. Uh Oh. Now they must get it back ancient curse threatens their family.<br/><i>On Netflix.</i></p>
      <p><b>Let It Snow</b><br/>At this point, we’re sure the guys over in Hollywood are running out of Christmas song lyrics to title their movies, but this Netflix movie at least has a solid reason. When a snowstorm hits a small town and a bunch of teenagers get stuck in it, new friendships are made and even a little festive romance is thrown in for good measure.<br/><i>On Netflix.</i></p>
      <p><b>Holiday in the Wild</b><br/>A sweet, romantic festive flick always warms the heart (or is it the hot choco we’re sipping on?), and the pairing between Rob Lowe and Kristin Davis definitely does the job. Basically, Kate (Davis) goes on a trip to Africa after her husband ends their marriage. That’s when she meets Derek (Lowe). Oh, and a baby elephant they need to rescue. Let the festive romance ensure…<br/><i>On Netflix.</i></p>
      <p><b>Jack Whitehall: Christmas with My Father</b><br/>If you’ve been following the popular British comedian’s strange adventures abroad with his father (you know, all the arguing), then a Christmas special with the duo should be right up your alley. If they already bicker as much as they do, then Christmas time will probably double that amount.<br/><i>On Netflix.</i></p>
      <h3>Family-friendly</h3>
      <p><b>The Nutcracker and the Four Realms</b><br/>Based on Tchaikovsky’s classic ballet this follow-up story sees young Clara transported to a fantasy world of gingerbread soldiers and mice armies after she loses a magical key. There she encounters the regents who preside over the land’s three realms who encourage Clara and a soldier called Phillip to brave the ominous Fourth Realm to retrieve Clara's key and return harmony to the unstable world. The stunning sets and beautiful costumes make this a modern day Christmas classic that all the fam will love.<br/><i>On OSN.</i></p>
      <p><b>The Man Who Invented Christmas</b><br/>In 1843 London, author Charles Dickens finds himself in financial trouble after writing three unsuccessful novels in a row. Desperate for a hit, Dickens relies on real-life inspiration and his vivid imagination to bring Ebeneezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim and other classic characters to life in A Christmas Carol, forever changing the holiday season into the celebration known today.<br/><i>On OSN.</i></p>
      <p><b>Christmas in the Smokies</b><br/>While probably the lesser known of the festive film line-up, it’s a heart-warming tale that will stir all the emotions. As the name suggests, this modern-day tale is set in the breathtaking Smoky Mountains and tells the story of one family’s journey to save their historic berry farm during a fateful holiday season.<br/><i>On OSN.</i></p>
      <p><b>Shelby: The Dog Who Saved Christmas</b><br/>Animal films are always going to tug on the heart strings and this cute tale about an abandoned dog and the friendship he strikes up with an isolated tween, does just that. Throw in a little comedy courtesy of Chevy Chase, who plays the tween boy’s grandpa, and you have a magical Christmas film with a very happy ending. It’s the power of paws, gets us every time.<br/><i>On OSN.</i></p>
      <p><b>The Christmas Project</b><br/>It’s the classic tween story about a bully who sees the error of his ways – eventually – with a festive twist. A sibling quartet of boys, with another baby on the way, try to show the bully that it pays to be nice, and instead of playing him at his own game (tricks and pranks and general nastiness) they do it through a series of kind gestures that ultimately turn the bad guy good.<br/><i>On OSN.</i></p>
      <p><b>A Magic Christmas</b><br/>A bakery owner tries to connect with his family by taking them to a remote cabin for Christmas. With no internet and no television, the teenagers get restless and grumpy, but then a rival family comes on to the scene and everyone’s competitive nature comes to the fore. This is a charming Christmas film that older kids will enjoy.<br/><i>On OSN.</i></p>
      <h3>Classics</h3>
      <p><b>Elf</b><br/>“Buddy The Elf, what’s your favourite colour?” still rings in our brains even after the first time we watched Will Ferrell’s silly and hilarious Elf. Most of us may have seen him travel to New York to find his real dad, but that doesn’t stop us watching it every year.<br/><i>On Netflix.</i></p>
      <p><b>The Christmas Chronicles</b><br/>It may have only come out in 2018, but there’s the saying ‘instant classic’ for a good reason. Giving us a new take on the usual Christmas conundrums, two siblings decide to capture Santa once and for all. It’s a brilliant watch, but what really makes it? Kurt Russel’s big beard – the best Santa beard we’ve ever laid eyes upon.<br/><i>On Netflix.</i></p>
      <p><b>The Grinch</b><br/>The town of Whooville is holly jolly when the holidays hit... Well, almost everyone in Whoville. Our beloved green scrooge - the Grinch - tries to hijack the Christmas festivities in his town. It'll take one sweet little girl to show him what the season is all about. Wintertime is incomplete with without this Dr. Seuss classic.<br/><i>On OSN</i></p>
      <p><b>The Polar Express</b><br/>Don’t believe in Christmas like the poor boy in this animated epic? Hop onboard the magical Polar Express straight to the North Pole and your views will change. Also, Tom Hanks voices nearly everyone in this festive adventure – try and guess who.<br/><i>On Netflix</i></p>
      <p><b>The Santa Claus 3: The Escape Clause</b><br/>The world is very much filled with movies about the big man in red, but this one takes a slightly different focus. When the evil Jack Frost decides he’d like to take over Christmas Santa Claus finds himself torn in two directions – keeping his new family happy (Father Christmas found his Mrs Claus in The Santa Claus 2) and foiling an evil plot.<br/><i>On OSN.</i></p>
