      <h1>Crisis on Infinite Earths Episode 1 – What Did You Think?!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:11:56+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>The first episode of <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-flash"><b>The Flash</b></a> began the five year buildup to <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b></a>. Last night on <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/supergirl"><b>Supergirl</b></a>, the end of everything finally arrived…and we want to hear what the Superhero Hype community thinks about it!</p>
      <p>This was a very <b>Supergirl</b> heavy episode, since Kara Zor-El lost almost everything she had. But at least she’s alive, which is more than Green Arrow can say. Oliver Queen has been fated to die in this crossover for almost a year. However, we’re not convinced that this is the last appearance of Stephen Amell in the event. After all, we’ve already seen more than one Oliver!</p>

      <p>Additionally, the opening moments touched upon a few unexpected cameos from the <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/titans"><b>Titans</b></a> and Tim Burton’s <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/batman">Batman</a>. The beloved world of <b>Batman ’66</b> may have even made an appearance if Burt Ward was playing a much older Dick Grayson. However, those Earths may have already been destroyed by the Anti-Monitor. Now, Argo City and Earth-38 have also fallen to the antimatter wave. At this rate, Oliver won’t be the only hero to fall. And there may not be much of a multiverse left to save…</p>
      <p><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b> episode 2 will be tonight’s episode of <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/batwoman"><b>Batwoman</b></a> on The CW.</p>
