      <p>The total value of Building Permits issued by Canadian municipalities declined by 1.5% to $8.3 billion on a monthly basis in October and fell short of the market expectation for an increase of 2.9%, the data published by Statistics Canada showed on Monday. Additionally, other data revealed that Housing Starts came in at 201,300 on a yearly basis in November to miss analysts' forecast of 205,000. </p>
      <p>The disappointing data was largely ignored by the market participants and the USD/CAD pair was last seen trading at 1.3255, where it was virtually unchanged on the day.</p>
