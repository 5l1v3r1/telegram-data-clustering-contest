      <p>He’s fast becoming one of the big fans’ favourites of regional rugby and for, Uzair Cassiem, the feeling is mutual.</p>
      <p>The Springboks back rower has been in outstanding form for the Scarlets this season and produced another huge display on the weekend.</p>
      <p>He was named man of the match following Saturday’s <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/bayonne-scarlets-leigh-halfpenny-report-17381728">crucial 19-11 Challenge Cup victory</a> over Bayonne in the south of France.</p>
      <p>That meant he had post-match interview duties to perform.</p>
      <p>But there was just one problem - Cassiem was in the crowd with the travelling Scarlets’ supporters.</p>
      <p>The former Cheetahs star had gone into the stand to celebrate with the fans who had made the journey over from west Wales, some of them wearing Cassiem beards in recognition of his cult hero status.</p>
      <p>After posing for some selfies and stopping for a few hugs, he finally made it back down on to the pitch for his TV interview.</p>
      <p>The following day, the eight-cap Cassiem made a point of posting a message of thanks to the Scarlets supporters on social media.</p>
      <p>“Safe travel back to Wales for all,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Totally overwhelmed by last night. I have no words, it is a moment I will treasure forever.</p>
      <p>“This team is built on so much respect, it’s a special group. And to the support - thank you, thank you, thank you.”</p>
      <p>Cassiem had a testing time in his first season with the Scarlets, as he was plagued by injury following his move from the Cheetahs.</p>
      <p>But this term he has been fully fit and firing. That’s enabled him to make an immense impact, both on the flank and at No 8, with his serial carrying, his tackling and his all-round work-rate.</p>
      <p>He’s also been superb in terms of his engagement with fans, both in person and on social media.</p>

      <p>It was a memorable weekend for the Scarlets as they recorded a first win on French soil in five years to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knock-out stages of the Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Full-back Leigh Halfpenny kicked 14 points on his first regional appearance of the campaign, earning warm plaudits from coach Brad Mooar.</p>
      <p>“He is world-class,” said Mooar.</p>
      <p>“It is an absolute privilege to work with a player like Leigh; just watching him go about preparing for game and what he does and to see him happy and smiling wearing that Scarlets jersey in a winning dressing room, it is fantastic.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t necessarily say a lot in the group, but when he does it is right on point and he is holding himself, and everybody, including the coaches, accountable in a really nice way.”</p>
      <p>The Scarlets will host Bayonne in the return match next Saturday evening, with more Wales World Cup players on course to be available.</p>
      <p>Prop Wyn Jones and scrum-half Gareth Davies should be on board after sitting out the weekend due to a hamstring issue and illness respectively, while second row Jake Ball also comes back into the equation.</p>
      <p>Aaron Shingler will be out for a week or so with a minor knee problem, while fellow flanker James Davies is sidelined by a back issue.</p>
      <p>That leaves just hooker Ken Owens and centre Hadleigh Parkes still on their post World Cup breaks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, prop Samson Lee should be ready to resume this coming weekend following a shoulder niggle.</p>
      <p>“We had a couple of late withdrawals before the game on Saturday - Wyn, Samson, Gareth Davies,” said Mooar.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to seeing the bulk of the squad back together and giving us some selection headaches.”</p>
      <p>The Scarlets lie second in Pool 2, five points adrift of Toulon, who will head to west Wales for a potential group decider in January.</p>
