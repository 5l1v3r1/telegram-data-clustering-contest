      <h1>What Charlton Athletic have said about the future of striker linked with Bristol City and Nottingham Forest</h1>
      <h2>He is out of contract in the summer</h2>

      <p>Bristol city are one of a number of clubs to have been linked with Lyle Taylor.</p>
      <p>The Charlton Athletic striker is out of contract in the summer and in demand, with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> said to be <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/bristol-city-looking-closely-championship-3623058">closely monitoring his situation.</a></p>
      <p>Yet they face competition for the 29-year-old, with Nottingham Forest, Burnley, Sheffield United, Norwich and Brentford all also said to be keeping tabs on Taylor.</p>

      <p>The striker has netted five goals in seven games for the Addicks this season and has impressed in the Championship after Charlton's promotion last season.</p>
      <p>So, what is the likelihood of him leaving Charlton?</p>
      <p>Roll back a month or so, and it would have been difficult to see Taylor staying at the Valley for too long, with owner Roland Duchatelet spending little.</p>
      <p>Yet the Addicks were recently taken over by East Street Investment and, speaking to <a href="https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/will-esi-takeover-help-keep-lyle-taylor-charlton-boss-lee-bowyer-gives-his-verdict/">London News Online</a> at the end of last month, manager Lee Bowyer seemed to indicate this would be beneficial to the club's chances of keeping Taylor.</p>
      <p>"It’s gonna help," he said.</p>
      <p>"Lyle loves playing under me. He wants me to be secure and now I’m going to be there for time.</p>
      <p>"If the club put me on a proper contract then I can’t see why Lyle wouldn’t sign, that’s just from his words to me.</p>
      <p>"I believe in what he says, I know he loves playing for the club and he is desperate to be back playing now.</p>
      <p>"He is a fans’ favourite and that suits him so I can’t see why we couldn’t get that over the line.</p>
      <p>"We all have to be sensible, hopefully they can kill two birds with one stone."</p>
