      <h1>White Island: Tourist hotspot and New Zealand’s most active volcano</h1>

      <p>White Island is New Zealand’s most continuously active volcano and last erupted three years ago.</p>
      <p>Five people have been killed and many more are unaccounted for following the tourist attraction’s latest eruption, which sent huge plumes of smoke and ash into the air.</p>
      <p>The threat level was raised last month following an increase in activity – meaning eruptions are more likely than normal and can happen with little or no warning.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Where is White Island?</b>

      <p>Also known by the Maori name Whakaari, the volcanic island has been built up by continuous volcanic activity over the past 150,000 years.</p>
      <p>About 70% of the volcano is underwater, making the volcanic structure the largest in New Zealand according to GeoNet, which monitors geological hazards in the area.</p>
      <p>Sulphur mining, which began in 1885, stopped in 1914 after a crater wall collapsed and a landslide destroyed the mine and village, killing twelve people.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand tourism website says tour operators provide transport to the island via boat, helicopter and float plane, and offer guided excursions.</p>
      <p>Daily tours attract approximately 10,000 visitors a year, GeoNet said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– When were the previous eruptions?</b>

      <p>An explosion occurred on August 5 2012 with a period of ash emissions, according to GeoNet.</p>
      <p>Steam and sulphur explosions followed in February and April 2013.</p>
      <p>In April 2016, a short-lived eruption occurred and formed a new depression in the crater complex. Later that year, ash was emitted from a vent.</p>
      <p>GeoNet raised the Volcanic Alert Level to Level 2 in November of this year following an increase in background activity.</p>
      <p>Michael Rosenberg, Duty Volcanologist, said at the time that signals were similar to the 2011-2016 period and that eruptive activity was more likely than normal and could happen with little or no warning.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– How is the volcano monitored?</b>

      <p>GeoNet says they frequently visit the island to collect gas and water samples and to make general observations.</p>
      <p>Dr Mohammad Heidarzadeh, Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at Brunel University London, says that activity on White Island is continuously monitored by cameras and specialised equipment.</p>
      <p>The volcano expert said: “Volcanoes such as the one on White Island are monitored by 24/7 by live cameras and several seismometers, which register all seismic activities.</p>
      <p>“Volcanoes trigger numerous small earthquakes, and these small tremors can give us a view of what is happening.</p>
      <p>“The signs seem to have been missed on this occasion though, causing five deaths.”</p>
