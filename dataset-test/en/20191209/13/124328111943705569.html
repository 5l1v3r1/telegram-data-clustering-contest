      <p>A woman who was left in agony for six months after giving birth discovered she'd been walking around with a fractured spine due to a back condition which weakened her bones. </p>
      <p>Heather Clatworthy, 37, a senior executive at the British Horse Society, from Warwickshire, broke her back in 2010 when in labour with her first child, Lilly.</p>
      <p>But doctors put her screams down to the pain of childbirth and it wasn't until half a year later that Heather was finally told she had a fracture caused by osteopenia - a condition in which bones are weaker than normal.</p>
      <p>Prior to her diagnosis, Heather would struggle through looking after her baby 'until she had no strength and would be left feeding her daughter on the bedroom floor'.</p>
      <p>But never one to give up, Heather has learned how to manage her condition through a healthy, active lifestyle, and is now planning to swim the English Channel for charity in 2020 - despite her fragile bones.</p>

      <p>Speaking to FEMAIL, Heather recalled: 'It wasn’t until Lilly was a few weeks old and doing simple tasks like lifting her out of her Moses basket was becoming unbearable, that I went to the doctors again. </p>
      <p>'They were convinced I had pulled a muscle and it would mend itself. I therefore carried on and suffered with it for six months despite being in terrible pain.  </p>
      <p>'The worst moment was when I tried to lift the car seat with my daughter in it from the pram to the car. It was pouring with rain and after attempting multiple angles; I ended up on all fours, desperately trying to shelter Lilly from the rain, and seeking help from a random passerby.'</p>

      <p>Heather eventually accepted painkillers from her doctors - after avoiding them for six months while breastfeeding her little one - and was given an MRI scan which confirmed she had fractured her spine.</p>
      <p>Heather was at first told she had developed osteoporosis - a condition which weakens bones and makes them more likely to break - which, to 'a new mother who was solo parenting most of the time, felt like a death sentence,' Heather admitted.</p>
      <p>The worried parent, who is also mother to son, Basil, 5, questioned: 'How can I wrap myself up in cotton wool whilst being a good mother at the same time?'</p>

      <h3>What is osteopenia? </h3>
      <p>The stage before osteoporosis is called osteopenia. This is when a bone density scan shows you have lower bone density than the average for your age, but not low enough to be classed as osteoporosis.</p>
      <p>Osteopenia does not always lead to osteoporosis. It depends on many factors.</p>
      <p>If you have osteopenia, there are steps you can take to keep your bones healthy and reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis, such as healthy eating and regular exercise.</p>
      <p>Your doctor may also prescribe one of the bone-strengthening treatments that are given to people with osteoporosis, depending on how weak your bones are and your risk of breaking a bone.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Following another scan at her next appointment, the mother-of-two was relieved to be told that the condition was localised to the spine and was referred to as osteopenia.</p>
      <p>'It was a relief to know what had been causing all the pain, however not quite what I had expected,' Heather admitted. </p>
      <p>Osteopenia can develop during pregnancy and means that bones have a lower density, but are not yet at the stage of osteoporosis. </p>
      <p>The condition typically doesn't have any visible symptoms, which makes it difficult to diagnose without a bone mineral density test. </p>
      <p>Not wasting anytime, Heather quickly researched the diagnosis further and discovered key factors that affect bone density, such as Vitamin D. </p>
      <p>'Generally eating the right foods, remaining active and leading a healthy lifestyle were the best things I could do to help myself,' Heather explained. </p>
      <p>She added: I’ve never been one to resort quickly to drugs unless I really need to. I also don’t like to mask injuries through pain relief, because I would rather know if something is healing OK.</p>

        <figcaption>In 2016, Heather (pictured right, with her family) decided to swim the 13-miles from Northern Ireland, where she's originally from, to the other side of the coast</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'Therefore, I went about educating myself as best as possible about the condition and doing everything possible to help myself through living an active, healthy balanced lifestyle.  </p>
      <p>'I did discuss this approach with the consultant who I was glad fully supported it,' Heather said.</p>
      <p>She explained that keeping as active as she needs to be, to strengthen her bones can be hard work while being a full-time mother but is 'achievable'. </p>

      <p>In 2016, Heather decided to swim the 13-miles from Northern Ireland, where she's originally from, to the other side of the coast.</p>
      <p>She became the first Irish person to have ever complete the swim and did so in four hours and 20 minutes.  </p>

        <figcaption>Heather (pictured) is doing her swim in aid of The British Horse Society, having been a keen horse rider since she was seven-years-old</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And for her next challenge, the keen swimmer is planning to swim the English Channel once again - after failing to successfully complete the journey in 2018. </p>
      <p>'As I need to maintain my fitness level to keep care of my spine, I have to set myself challenges to remain motivated,' Heather explained.    </p>
      <p>'Being a sea swimmer and adrenaline junkie I had always had the English Channel on my radar, but again had never really got around to it.</p>
      <p>'Yet after great encouragement from friends, family and colleagues I decided I would give it a go.'</p>
      <p>She added: 'Unfortunately my first attempt in 2018 was unsuccessful due to poor weather conditions and tidal change which took me too far north of the French coastline. </p>
      <p>'Considering I didn’t know if I would even reach the half-way point, which I did, I’m really pleased with how I did and what I managed to achieve on the day. </p>
      <p>'If anything it has made me even more determined to complete the swim in 2020 but I can only do my best and hope that all the elements are in my favour on the day. I’m not an elite athlete, but I can do it.'</p>
