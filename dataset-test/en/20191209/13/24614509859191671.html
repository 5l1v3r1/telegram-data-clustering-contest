      <p><b>New Age Beverages</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nbev-stock-quote/"><b><u>NBEV</u></b></a>) stock is a loser. NBEV stock is down 73% from its peak this February and off over 74% from its 52-week high.</p>

      <p>The CEO, Brent Willis, consistently sells portions of his shares each month. Furthermore, this company, including its recently added multi-level marketing company Morinda, is losing money and it is getting deeper into net debt.</p>
      <p>That should tell you everything you need to know about NBEV stock to make a decision to invest. But wait, there’s more! NBEV has consistently delayed its rollout of CBD drinks, missed numerous guidance estimates that it gave out, and displayed poor management decision-making.</p>
      <p>That is the judgment of <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4287711-new-age-beverages-why-is-still-not-buy">several analysts</a> in <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4252756-new-age-beverages-cbd-beverages-delayed-core-business-continues-to-contract">Seeking Alpha</a> that have written articles about New Age Beverages stock. Most of them have presciently predicted the fall of the stock. One author <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4252756-new-age-beverages-cbd-beverages-delayed-core-business-continues-to-contract">even believes</a> the stock is only worth $1.57 per share, which is over 21% lower than today’s price for NBEV stock.</p>
      <h3>Focus on the Cash</h3>
      <p>New Age Beverages is running a huge operating cash flow deficit. That loss necessitates further borrowing, equity raises and/or asset sales each quarter.</p>
      <p>For example, in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579823/000149315219017532/form10-q.htm">latest 10-Q filing</a> by NBEV, the operating cash flow loss for the nine months ending September 30, was $20.9 million. In addition, its free cash flow, after capex spending and a security deposit requirement, was negative $25.3 million.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind this is a company whose market value is just $154 million. So it can’t really afford to keep on having these kinds of losses. It won’t be able to finance a drain in cash flow like this each year.</p>
      <p>NBEV financed these losses by selling a large asset for $35.8 million. But it can’t keep on doing this. In fact, NBEV sold shares to the public for $13.5 million during the first nine months of 2019. It likely won’t be able to do this again as well, with NBEV stock down so much.</p>
      <h3>Deep in Debt</h3>
      <p>New Age Beverages has $68 million in cash as of September. But it has $24.2 million in long term debt, up from $7.4 in debt at the beginning of 2019.</p>
      <p>In addition, NBEV has huge operating and deferred lease liabilities. These liabilities now total $52.2 million. So now NBEV has $76.4 million in debt and long-term liabilities. This is up from $18.4 million at the beginning of 2019.</p>
      <p>In effect, NBEV now has net debt and long-term liabilities of $8.4 million. This is a complete reversal from the start of 2019 when New Age Beverages had net <i>cash </i>of $24.1 million.</p>
      <p>That’s what running continuing cash flow losses will do to your company. Your net cash balance turns into a net debt balance.</p>
      <p>Frankly, it’s another sign of a loser company.</p>
      <h3>The Botto Line on NBEV Stock</h3>
      <p>The reality is that a lot of short-sellers in this stock is probably looking to cover their short sales. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NBEV/key-statistics?p=NBEV">Yahoo! Finance reports</a> that 28% of the shares outstanding are held by short-sellers. It also says that 30.5% of the float (i.e., shares not held by insiders) is short.</p>
      <p>What that will probably mean is that when a number of short-sellers start to cover their short bets they will force others into the same trade, pushing up the stock. So don’t be surprised to see a sudden spike in New Age Beverages stock.</p>
      <p>But that should not be a sign to get into the stock, as if its outlook has somehow turned around. I would avoid this loser no matter what happens to the NBEV stock price.</p>
      <p>I have shown that at best the company is on speculative grounds financially. That is not the kind of defensive, margin-of-safety stock that leads to higher values for most investors.</p>
