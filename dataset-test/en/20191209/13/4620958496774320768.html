      <p>Seth Rogen was right: “The best BBQ places are generally in the underground parking garage of department stores.”</p>
      <p>The Vancouver-born actor was talking about HK BBQ Master, the local legend in the Chinese BBQ game that is located off Number 3 Road in Richmond in the parking garage under the Real Canadian SuperStore. Rogen <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/01/10/seth-rogen-lees-donuts-vancouver-aquarium/">ended up there</a> earlier this year on a tip from a (very smart) buddy, and it was all captured in chef and <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/10/16/david-chang-momofuku-vancouver/">restaurateur</a> David Chang’s <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/10/10/seth-rogen-david-chang-netflix-show-vancouver-2019/">Netflix show <i>Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner</i></a>.</p>
      <p>While the Chang show features him and Rogen <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/10/28/seth-rogen-david-chang-netflix-vancouver-show-map/">eating and exploring their way around Vancouver</a> – and Richmond – when the show dropped in October, those who wanted to check out HK BBQ Master and enjoy some of chef/owner Eric Leung’s legendary BBQ duck or pork, soy sauce chicken with rice, sauce, and steamed greens were SOL: HK BBQ Master closed down Oct. 1 for a major renovation.</p>
      <p>Initially hoping to be done by November with the expansion into the next door space that allows for much more seating, HK BBQ Master finally was able to welcome the public back into their now-expanded space as of Sunday, December 8.</p>

      <p>That means NOW you can head there, cash in hand, to try the city’s best Chinese BBQ eats. Be ready for a line, and try to get there before they’re sold out for the day.</p>
      <p>Now, if only Chang’s Vancouver outpost of Momofuku Noodle Bar would hurry up and be done…</p>
      <p>
        <i>HK BBQ Master is located at 4651 No 3 Rd in Richmond.</i>
