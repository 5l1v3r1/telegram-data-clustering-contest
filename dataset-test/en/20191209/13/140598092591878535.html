      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:06:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-sport/" target="_blank">Telegraph Sport</a></address>
      <p>Openers <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/07/02/tammy-beaumont-talk-lot-radiator-not-drain-team-will-head/">Tammy Beaumont </a>and Danni Wyatt hit one-day international hundreds as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/08/31/kia-super-league-interim-solution-ultimately-served-womens-cricket/">England made a winning start </a>against Pakistan in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The pair shared a first-wicket stand of 188 to set up a 75-run victory at Kuala Lumpur's Kinrara Oval, the opening game of an ICC Women's Championship series featuring three ODIs and three Twenty20s.</p>
      <p>Beaumont struck nine fours in her 107 from 141 balls before becoming one of Rameen Shamim's three victims.</p>
      <p>Wyatt was the more aggressive of the pair, striking 12 fours and three sixes in a majestic 95-ball 110 to claim the player of the match award.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/womens-sport/2019/09/01/heather-knight-back-best-england-captain-leads-western-storm/">Skipper Heather Knight chipped in</a> with 41 from 44 balls as England, determined to bounce back from last summer's Ashes series defeat to Australia, posted 284 for six from 50 overs.</p>
      <p>Pakistan slumped to five for two as Anya Shrubsole and Katherine Brunt removed openers Nahida Khan and Sidra Ameen inside the opening three overs.</p>
      <p>Captain Bismah Maroof offered resistance with 69 from 94 balls, but Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals and were always behind the required run rate.</p>
      <p>Kate Cross took the crucial wickets of Bismah and Aliya Riaz (39) and finished with four for 32 from seven overs.</p>
      <p>Rain briefly interrupted play, but the players were able to return to the field and Pakistan were eventually dismissed for 209 from 44.4 overs.</p>
      <p>Seamer Brunt (2-31) and leg-spinner Sarah Glenn (2-38) offered excellent support to Cross.</p>
