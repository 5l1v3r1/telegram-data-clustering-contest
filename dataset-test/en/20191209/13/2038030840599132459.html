      <p>Stefano was originally played by Joseph Mascolo, reports <a href="https://dailysoapdish.com/2019/12/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-the-jury-is-out-about-stephen-nichols-as-stefano-dimera/"><b>Daily Soap Dish</b></a>, who died at the age of 87 in December 2016.</p>
      <p>Viewers were made to believe that his character was killed by Hope after she held him responsible for Bo's death, however, in 2017, it appears Stefano may have actually faked his death.Â Now, in 2019, Stefano returns to Salem, this time in the form of Steve Johnson (Stephen Nichols) with the help of Princess Gina (Kristian Alfonso who also plays Hope) and Dr Rolf (William Utay).</p>
      <p>And to think, this isn't even the strangest of storylines. Read the <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/6-days-of-our-lives-storylines-well-never-forget-20160621"><b>6 Days of Our Lives storylines we'll never forget here</b></a>.</p>
