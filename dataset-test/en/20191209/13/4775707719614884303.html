      <p>Cloud Chamber will be based in Novato, California and Montreal, Quebec. 2K describes the studio in its press release as, "A collective of storytellers eager to push the frontlines of interactive entertainment by making unique, entertaining and thoughtful experiences that engage the world."</p>
      <p>The studio is being led by Kelley Gilmore, a 22-year industry veteran with over 40 games shipped to date. Gilmore has previously worked on the Sid Meier’s Civilization and XCOM franchises. Gilmore is also the first woman in 2K's history to launch and lead a development studio. Her role will be based in California.</p>
      <p>Kelley Gilmore said, “We founded Cloud Chamber to create yet-to-be-discovered worlds – and their stories within – that push the boundaries of what is possible in the video game medium. Our team believes in the beauty and strength of diversity, in both the makeup of the studio and the nature of its thinking. We are a deeply experienced group of game makers, including many responsible for BioShock’s principal creation, advancement and longstanding notoriety, and honoured to be part of the 2K family as stewards of this iconic franchise.”</p>
      <p>Over in Montreal, Ken Schachter will be taking on the studio manager role for Cloud Chamber who has, "extensive experience in development, production, technology and creative roles." Schachter has previously worked at Zynga and Gameloft and founded the independent game developer and publisher, Trapdoor.</p>
      <p>David Ismailer, president of 2K said, "BioShock is one of the most beloved, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation. We can’t wait to see where its powerful narrative and iconic, first-person shooter gameplay head in the future with our new studio team at Cloud Chamber leading the charge.”</p>
