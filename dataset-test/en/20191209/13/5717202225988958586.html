      <h1>Marcelo Bielsa says he has not decided who Kalvin Phillips will replace in Leeds side</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:24:39+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa has told his pre-Hull City press conference – <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/marcelo-bielsa-live-press-conference-17386982">as per Leeds Live</a> – that midfielder Kalvin Phillips will return to the Leeds United side on Tuesday evening to take on Hull City – but has not decided who the midfielder will replace.</p>
      <p>Phillips, 24, was suspended for Saturday’s excellent 2-0 win away at Huddersfield Town thanks to goals from Gjanni Alioski and Pablo Hernandez. Leeds did ride their luck at times, with Kiko Casilla producing a string of excellent saves.</p>
      <p>But Phillips is now available again for the clash against Hull at Elland Road, who come into the match in stunning form after winning five of their last eight. Leeds, though, have won their last six league games and are eight points clear of third.</p>
      <p>Asked about Phillips, Bielsa confirmed the Premier League-linked midfielder would return to the starting eleven on Tuesday night – but the Argentine also stated that he has not decided who Phillips will replace.</p>
      <p>“[Phillips} will come back to play,” <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/marcelo-bielsa-live-press-conference-17386982">Bielsa said</a>, when asked if Phillips would start or just return as part of the 18-man squad. "Someone is going to leave the team. I have not decided.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Where can Phillips come back in?</h3>
      <p>Leeds combined Luke Ayling and Gaetano Berardi at centre-back on Saturday, while Ben White replaced Phillips played in midfield. Liam Cooper remains sidelined, but the most likely option is that White will go back to his natural position.</p>
      <p>It would see either Ayling or Berardi drop out – most likely the latter. But Bielsa does have options. Phillips could come back in and replace Cooper, while Berardi or Ayling could go across to right-back and another player could miss out.</p>
