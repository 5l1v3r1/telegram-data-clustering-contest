      <h1>Mom 'killed toddler by slapping her to stop seizure caused by abusive boyfriend'</h1>

      <p>A mother helped kill her vomiting toddler by trying to slap her out of a seizure triggered by her boyfriend’s abuse, police say.</p>
      <p>Sarah Newsom and boyfriend Joshua Fulbright, both 24, reportedly killed Scarlett Olivia Newsom in October 2018, with Fulbright’s trial set to begin Monday.</p>
      <p>Fulbright, of Wichita Falls in Texas, is said to have slapped Scarlett so hard on the left side of her head she was left with an enormous bruise.</p>
      <p>Newsom reportedly watched her boyfriend assault Scarlett, before losing patience with the little girl when she began to vomit and suffer seizures.</p>
      <p>The mother reportedly began slapping the toddler herself in a bid to get the neurological episodes to stop, only for Scarlett to lose consciousness, it is alleged.</p>

      <p>Scarlett was eventually rushed to hospital, where she spent four days on life support before being removed from her ventilator and dying.</p>
      <p>Doctors who treated Scarlett said the youngster had also been left with horrendous bruises on her arms and back.</p>
      <p>After the toddler died, her aunt Lauren Raindl paid tribute, telling the Wichita Falls Times Record News: ‘She was the sweetest little girl.</p>
      <p>‘She had beautiful blue eyes – everyone called her “baby blue.”</p>
      <p>‘She could light up anyone’s day.’</p>

      <p>The youngster’s organs were donated to help save other children’s lives.</p>
      <p>Fulbright faces a charge of injury to a child with serious bodily injury, with jurors set to hear opening statements from prosecutors Monday.</p>
      <p>Newsom faces the same charge as her boyfriend, and will be charged at a later date.</p>
      <p>The pair are being held in jail on a combined $300,000 bond.</p>
