      <p>They revealed that three men, aged 33, 19 and 32, had all been nicked for alleged assaults at the Hampden Park clash.</p>
      <p>And the other three, aged 23, 50 and 21, were cuffed for allegedly breaching the peace.</p>
      <p>Two of the men are due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.</p>
      <p>The Hoops claimed their fourth successive League Cup yesterday with their Old Firm win.</p>
      <p>Christopher Julien’s second half goal was enough to clinch the trophy for Neil Lennon’s men.</p>
      <p>The Hoops were able to hang on after Jeremie Frimpong was sent off and Gers forward Alfredo Morelos missed a penalty.</p>
      <p>But Rangers skipper <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5044989/tavernier-jullien-goal-mind-boggling-rangers-celtic/">James Tavernier blasted the decision</a> to allow Julien’s goal to stand as “mind-boggling”.</p>
      <p>TV replays showed at least three Celtic players, including the Frenchman, were in offside positions when Ryan Christie delivered his cross for the winning goal.</p>
      <p>Celtic legend <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5045195/celtic-john-hartson-rangers-christopher-jullien-offside/">John Hartson dismissed Rangers' complaints</a> over the goal with a throwback to a disallowed strike of his own.</p>
      <p>The Hoops legend wrongly had a goal chopped off for offside in the 2-1 defeat to the Light Blues in the 2003 League Cup Final.</p>
      <p>And Talksport host <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5045133/alan-brazil-alfredo-morelos-cheat-rangers-celtic-talksport/">Alan Brazil branded Colombian striker Morelos a “cheat”</a> after his side’s defeat.</p>
