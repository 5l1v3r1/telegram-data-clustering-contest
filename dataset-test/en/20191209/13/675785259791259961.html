      <h1>Jose Mourinho explains Sir Alex Ferguson talks after Son Heung-min's stunning solo goal</h1>
      <h2>The South Korean forward has been in sensational form since Mourinho's appointment and scored a goal of the season contender in the win against Burnley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:21:52+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has revealed that he once spoke to former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> manager Sir Alex Ferguson about the impact of Ji-sung Park on his side following Son Heung-min's sensational goal for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>Son scored one of the goals of the season in Spurs' 5-0 thumping of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> when he dribbled from the edge of his own box and beat three defenders to score the third of the game, and the 27-year-old has now scored twice and created five assists in Mourinho's five games in charge of the club.</p>
      <p>Fellow South Korean Park played for United between 2005-2012 and Ferguson has often been vocal in his praise of the former midfielder and his contributions to the team.</p>

      <p>And Mourinho said his talk with Ferguson meant he knew Son would be a big player for him.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game Mourinho said: "From the outside I had a feeling, I remember speaking to Sir Alex about Ji-sung Park.</p>
      <p>"Maybe it's a cultural thing. They're very coachable. The kid is fantastic. I'm very happy, so happy."</p>
      <p>Son certainly seems to be enjoying life under Mourinho, and the Portuguese manager said last week: "I am in love with that guy, so I imagine the people that are here with him four or five years... fantastic boy."</p>

      <p>Son is likely to be rested when Spurs take on Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Mourinho likely to field a youthful side as his team have already sealed their qualification for the knockout stages of the competition.</p>
      <p>He should be back in action when Spurs travel to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on Sunday looking to leapfrog Nuno Santo's side in the table and seal their fifth win in six games under Mourinho.</p>
