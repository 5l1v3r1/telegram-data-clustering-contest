      <p>LONDON: Labour party candidate Holly Kal-Weiss sums up the mood of Jewish constituents she's met on the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/uk-election-campaign-brexit-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-12166732">election campaign trail</a> in the "bagel belt" constituencies around north London.</p>
      <p>"People are frightened," she told AFP as she canvassed in the area, so-called because of its sizeable Jewish population. "You can hear it in their voice".</p>

      <p>Kal-Weiss, who is also Jewish, said the rift between the party she represents and her own community was personally "very painful", testing traditional loyalties and sowing division.</p>
      <p>Britain goes to the polls on Thursday (Dec 12) and accusations of anti-Semitism that have dogged Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could well influence the overall result.</p>
      <p>Brexit and the effects of austerity have been key issues, but the question of whether the party and its leader have a problem with Jews has also been a recurring theme.</p>
      <p>Last month, Britain's Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis made an unprecedented intervention, urging followers to vote with their conscience.</p>
      <p>But his message was clear: "A new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root," he said, warning that the "very soul of our nation is at stake".</p>
      <p>
        <b>CONSPIRACY THEORIES</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) is one of the oldest socialist societies affiliated to the Labour party, but last week accused Corbyn personally of anti-Semitic behaviour.</p>
      <p>Some 70 Labour staff contributed to a dossier handed to a human rights watchdog probing the claims. One listed 22 examples of alleged abuse at party meetings.</p>
      <p>On one occasion, he said he was told: "Hitler was right."</p>
      <p>Veteran socialist Corbyn, his supporters and the party pride themselves on their history of fighting racism, which they believe to be a right-wing scourge.</p>
      <p>Corbyn has repeatedly said he "abhors" anti-Semitism. His defenders argue the accusations stem purely from his opposition to Israel's actions against the Palestinians.</p>

      <p>But author and anti-Semitism expert David Hirsh said there was a "long history of authentically left-wing anti-Semitism" within the socialist movement.</p>
      <p>"Jeremy Corbyn, if you say to him, 'Tell me about the history of anti-Semitism within your own movement', he probably just won't know the story," he said.</p>
      <p>Hirsh, a former Labour students leader, said the rise of populist conspiracy theories in the age of the internet and anti-establishment rage had put Jews in the firing line.</p>
      <p>"Often the way that 'capitalism' is used or the way the word 'the ruling-class' is used is a kind of conspiracy fantasy. Right-wing and left-wing populism have so much in common," he added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DIFFICULT CHOICES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kal-Weiss, who is running in the Hertsmere seat south of St Albans, admitted Labour had "underestimated the in-built fear" within the community.</p>
      <p>Close historic ties between the Jewish community and socialists had been tested, she added.</p>
      <p>"I'm an active member of a synagogue," she explained in her car, shortly after hitting the streets on a freezing cold December night.</p>
      <p>"Up until recently, there would have been a lot of Labour voters there. But there is a lot of angst. There's a lot of anger out there, from the Jewish community directed at me.</p>
      <p>"It's not nice. I was raised within the Jewish community that it's really important to look after everybody," she added. "I'm living my Judaism and they're cross with me".</p>
      <p>In the Finchley and Golders Green constituency in northwest London, Conservative candidate Mike Freer is facing a stiff challenge to retain his seat.</p>

      <p>His main challenger is the Jewish former Labour MP Luciana Berger, who quit the party over anti-Semitism to join the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>"You talk to people who are in their 80s and 90s and they were terrified. The words that resonated were, 'This is how it started in Germany'," he said.</p>
      <p>Local voter Brian Lacey, 83, told Freer from his doorway: "I run an art group locally and we have lots and lots of Jewish people, most of them are so upset.</p>
      <p>"I can see history repeating itself. That may be an exaggeration at this point but all these little gremlins start and they gather momentum."</p>
      <p>
        <b>LEAST WORST OPTION?</b>
      </p>
      <p>But for those who fear a "right-wing" Brexit, picking a candidate is particularly difficult, as Labour represents the only realistic chance of reversing the 2016 referendum result.</p>
      <p>"I'm honestly not sure which will be worse in the long run, Corbyn ... or (Boris) Johnson," said one homeowner, who asked not to be named but identified as a secular Jew.</p>

      <p>He is worried about the Conservative prime minister's commitment to Britain's departure from the European Union.</p>
      <p>"We have some sense of history and how little things became big things," said the pensioner.</p>
      <p>"I don't have that kind of fear, I think there's a bit more resilience in this country. But some people do."</p>
