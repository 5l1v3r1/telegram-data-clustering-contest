      <p>"We are proud to be associated with the sports journalists through this sponsorship. You have done a tremendous job in your responsibility to tell the story, not only those that touched on our brand but<br/>many that have gone to shape the narrative of what sports represents in our country," said Kiptum.</p>
      <p>SJAK president Chris Mbaisi said: "I thank Betway for coming on board, this is a sign that they appreciate sports journalists and what they do. We look forward to having a great and fun day. We are hopeful we will have more engagements with Betway."</p>
      <p>According to competition rules proposed by SJAK, each publication will enter a maximum of ten participants. The tournament is open to all journalists from sports, business, political and feature desks, with an emphasis on gender representation.</p>
      <p>The ten participants from each publication will compete in all five events. Following each event, podium finishers will be awarded prizes. Additionally, top performers in each event will earn points for their respective publications. At the end of the tournament, the points will be tallied to decide the overall winner.</p>
