      <p>Update 12/09/2019 12:33pm:</p>
      <p>Previously, it was reported that R. Kelly allegedly bribed a public official to allow him to marry Aaliyah in 1994. Now, R. Kelly’s ex-tour manager— Demetrius Smith, has admitted to getting false documents for the singer to allegedly carry out his plan of marrying a 15-year old Aaliyah.</p>
      <p>Smith gave his testimony, saying, “I was in the room when they got married. I’m not proud of that. I had papers forged for them when Aaliyah was underaged. It was just a quick little ceremony. She didn’t have on a white dress. He didn’t have on a tux. Just every day wear. She looked worried and scared." It was noted that Smith agreed to testify against Kelly, but doesn’t want the singer to go to jail.</p>

      <p>According to court documents obtained by Complex, R. Kelly is being accused of bribing a public official to obtain a fake ID for Aaliyah so the two could get married when the late singer was just 15-years-old. The document reads: </p>
      <p>
        <i>On or about August 30, 1994, within the Northern District of Illinois, the defendant ROBERT SYLVESTER KELLY, together with others, did knowingly and intentionally cause another individual to promise and tender to a public officer and public employee property, to wit: Unites States currency, that such public officer and public employee was not authorized by law to accept, with the intent to influence the performance of an act related to the employment and function of a public officer and public employee, to wit: the creation of a fraudulent identification document for Jane Doe #1, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, in violation of Illinois Criminal Code Sections 5/33-l(a) and 5/5-1.</i>
