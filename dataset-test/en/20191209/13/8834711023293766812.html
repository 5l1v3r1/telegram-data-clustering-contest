      <h1>Eskom Predicts Two More Years Of Potential Load Shedding</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:03:10+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>Despite its efforts to minimise the risk of load shedding and repairing its power systems, Eskom said the country could experience two more years of power cuts.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the Gushwell Brooks show on Sunday, deputy spokesperson Dikatso Mothae said the power station units haven’t been properly maintained for a number of years.</p>
      <p>The power utility has been implementing blackouts since last week Thursday, citing wet coal and vulnerable and unreliable system among their reasons.</p>
      <p>Mothae said getting the systems reliable and in good shape to operate effectively would take some time.</p>
      <p>“The bigger issue is because we have not maintained our power station units over many years. It is going to take some time to get to a state where they are more reliable. Currently, the system is very vulnerable and unpredictable.”</p>
      <p>Mothae said they were working on having a more predictable system in the long run, adding, however, that that might take some time.</p>
      <p>“We are working around making sure that in the long term that we have a more predictable system, but it will take some time to get to that point – we’re talking about two years and we’d have to live with potential load shedding.”</p>
