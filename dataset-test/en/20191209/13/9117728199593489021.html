      <h1>Chase Carey reveals how sponsors are close to F1</h1>

        <b>F1 CEO Chase Carey has revealed that sponsors are looking to join forces with F1 like never before as the sport becomes a more global brand. Liberty Media are rumoured to be ready to announce another major sponsor to join the core of companies already affiliated with F1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pirelli, DHL, Rolex, Heineken and Emirates are currently the main partners to F1, and Carey says it has been a challenge to build more marketing contacts for F1, with the area seemingly neglected by former boss Bernie Ecclestone.</p>

      <p>Carey told motorsport.com:Â <i>"Our cupboard was pretty bare, because we didn't really have a sponsor group. We hadn't created any tools. We hadn't created capabilities to tell the story of F1, to create some excitement.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We have some momentum today. We've had attendance up, we've had viewership up, we've got a good story, we've got new dimensions to the sport.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"So we had to develop the array of initiatives, whether it's digital initiatives, regional feeds, virtual ads, fan festivals, all those types of opportunities to create tailored targeted opportunities.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The traction with interested sponsors has been on a steady rise, we've never been busier. I've got a three page back list of sponsors we're engaged with. Obviously, until the sponsors are signed, deals aren't done.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Certainly, I'd say we feel we have gotten progressively better, as we've gone along. So while it's been slower and harder than I would have planned it to be a couple of years ago, I think that in many ways is the nature of where we started, and we started really from ground zero."</i>
