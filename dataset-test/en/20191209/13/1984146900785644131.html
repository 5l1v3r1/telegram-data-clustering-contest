      <p>She is the toast of the jungle after winning I'm A Celebrity on Sunday night but Jacqueline Jossa left viewers heartbroken with something she said in her interview.</p>
      <p>EastEnders actress <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-jacqueline-jossa-im-celebrity-17385064">Jacqueline</a> upset the odds by beating red hot favourite Andy Whyment to triumph in Sunday's live final, with Roman Kemp finishing in third.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/jacqueline-jossa-wins-im-celebrity-17385401">Jacqueline's I'm A Celebrity win</a> , while celebrated by plenty of people who had her as their Queen of the Jungle from day one, didn't go down too well with others, who even claimed <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-winner-jacqueline-17385461">the result was fixed</a> and Andy should have won.</p>
      <p>But, before Ant &amp; Dec had even announced the final result, viewers were upset by something that Jacqueline said to the Geordie duo in the video above.</p>
      <p>When questioned on how much getting to the I'm A Celebrity final meant to her, the 27-year-old mum of two said: "I think it's so easy to care so much what other people think of you, trolls, people who say nasty things for the sake of it and I try to change their opinion.</p>
      <p>"Here you have no choice, you have to be you. Here I have different people bigging me up of different ages, I can't really work out what is happening.</p>
      <p>"I've always been known as Lauren from EastEnders, or a doormat, or whatever you want to call it, and coming here I have actually proved myself."</p>
      <p>And the "doormat" comment really got to a number of fans watching at home. One reacted "Jacqueline saying people know her as a doormat has broke my heart," and another tweeted "Jacqueline referring to herself as a doormat breaks my f***** heart, I hope she realises she deserves better poor lassie."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline is married to former TOWIE cast member Dan Osborne but their marriage has been dogged by cheating rumours, with Dan slamming more allegations made against him just this week, from Chloe Ayling, the model who he appeared in Celebrity Big Brother with in 2018.</p>
