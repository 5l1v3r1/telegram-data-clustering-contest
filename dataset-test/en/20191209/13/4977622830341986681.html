      <p>Under ISRO’s Project Netra or ‘Network for Space Objects, Tracking, and Analysis’, the Centre has proposed 33.3 crore for securing Indian satellites from space debris and other dangers, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-proposes-33-crore-to-protect-indian-satellites-from-space-debris/article30238155.ece">Reports</a> <i>The Hindu.</i></p>
      <p>A resolution was moved by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week in the Lok Sabha for the said grant which was approved by the house.</p>
      <p>Netra system was launched by India in September to secure the satellites and other assets in space at an estimated cost of 400 crore.</p>
      <p>India has many satellites that play a vital role in communication, weather forecast and imagery and the junk in space pose serious risks to the man-made satellite.</p>
      <p>Additionally, to be a responsible space power, monitoring capability is necessary for protection of space assets.</p>
      <p>Former director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre MYS Prasad said “The NETRA project would provide India with the same capability as the US and Russia to assess threats from space debris and other hazards.”</p>
