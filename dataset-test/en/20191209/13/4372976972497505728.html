      <h1>Jaguar upgrades I-Pace with increased range for free</h1>
      <h2>Using data from the I-Pace eTrophy racing series</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/tony-markovich/" target="_blank">Tony Markovich</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> launched the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2017/09/12/jaguars-going-racing-with-the-battery-electric-i-pace/">I-Pace eTrophy</a> racing series in 2018, and ever since, it's been collecting data on its battery electric <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/crossover/">crossover</a>. Using that research, Jaguar has managed small refinements that incrementally improve how the car runs and drives. In past times, these types of upgrades were implemented during a refresh or redesign, but thanks to the computerized nature of modern vehicles, tuning information can be relayed to the vehicles immediately. Installed by <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealers</a>, Jaguar is releasing a free <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2018/06/13/2019-jaguar-ipace-first-drive-review/">I-Pace</a> software update that affects the battery, aerodynamics and all-wheel-drive system.  </p>
      <p>Jaguar already offers one of the best battery-operated vehicles on the road today, but the competition pool is quickly improving and becoming more crowded. In order to keep the I-Pace fresh, Jaguar decided to share its learnings from its eTrophy racing series and "more than 50 million miles" of real-world driving. </p>
      <p>As it stands, the I-Pace packs a 90-kWh lithium-ion battery that is EPA-rated at 234 miles on a single charge. It has 394 maximum horsepower, 512 lb-ft of torque, and Jaguar claims it can do 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds. With the new update, Jaguar says the battery can "run to a lower state of charge than previously without affecting drivability, durability, or performance." This only affects range and efficiency, though, not power.</p>
      <p>All I-Paces are all-wheel-drive, and the update directly affects the car's traction system. Jaguar has refined the torque distribution between the front and rear motors, which improves the car's efficiency in ECO mode. A third update deals with the car's aerodynamics. Jaguar has refined thermal management control by using the active radiator vane system more frequently. Finally, small tweaks also improved the regenerative <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/brakes/">braking system</a>.  </p>
      <p>All said, these upgrades potentially equate to an 8% increase in range, which is about 12 miles, depending on usage. Jaguar did note, however, that the official <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">EPA</a> number would not change. Those who own I-Paces can take their cars to a local <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealership</a>, and a technician will update the software, which also includes advanced over-the-air functionality. </p>
