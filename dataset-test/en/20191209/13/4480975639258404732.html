      <h1>Gold Technical Analysis: The set-up seems tilted in favour of bearish traders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:15:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/haresh-menghani" target="_blank">Haresh Menghani</a></address>
      <p>Gold regains some positive traction amid persistent trade uncertainty.<br/>The upside is likely to remain capped ahead of the FOMC policy update.</p>
      <p>Gold remained well within a broader trading band held over the past one month or so and the range-bound price action constituted towards the formation of a rectangle on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a>.</p>
      <p>Given the commodity's recent pullback from multi-year tops and a subsequent break through the key 100-day SMA support, the rectangle might still be categorized as a continuation pattern.</p>
      <p>This coupled with the fact that the yellow metal has been trending lower along a descending trend-channel formation over the past two months or so further adds credence to the negative outlook.</p>
      <p>However, persistent US-China trade uncertainty seemed to be the only factor lending some support and helping limit the downside, at least for the time being and ahead of the FOMC policy update.</p>
      <p>Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a sustained weakness below the recent trading range support, around the $1455-54 region, before positioning for any further near-term depreciating move.</p>
      <p>Below the mentioned support, the commodity is likely to accelerate the slide further towards November monthly lows support near the $1445 region en-route the lower end of the descending channel.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, any attempted positive move might continue to confront some fresh supply around the $1475-76 region and is likely to remain capped by 100-day SMA barrier near the $1487-88 region.</p>
      <p>Above the mentioned hurdle, the commodity is likely to aim towards reclaiming the key $1500 psychological mark before eventually darting towards the trend-channel <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, near the $1507 region.</p>
