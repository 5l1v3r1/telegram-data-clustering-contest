      <p>One of the UK's F-35 aircraft has travelled back home on HMS Queen Elizabeth after developing a fault in the US.</p>
      <p>A Royal Navy spokesperson said that after <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/british-f-35bs-land-hms-queen-elizabeth-first-time">flight trials in the United States</a>, one of the Lightning jets will need to undergo repair and maintenance work.</p>
      <p>"Following completion of successful flying trials in the US, one F-35 Lightning remained embarked on HMS Queen Elizabeth in order for repair and maintenance work to be completed," the spokesperson said. </p>
      <blockquote>"The aircraft will return to RAF Marham in the near future."</blockquote>

      <p>The F-35 was unable to fly home from the US because of the technical problem.</p>
      <p>The aircraft is expected to take off from the aircraft carrier in Portsmouth and fly back to RAF Marham once the fault has been addressed.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, HM Naval Base Portsmouth dismissed rumours suggesting the F-35 could take off on Monday.</p>
