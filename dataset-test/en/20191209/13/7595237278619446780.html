      <p>A 20-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to murdering a Japanese national in Dundalk nearly two years ago by reason of insanity. </p>
      <p>Mohamed Morei, of no fixed abode, is charged with murdering Yosuke Sasaki, 24, at Long Avenue, Dundalk, Co Louth on 3 January, 2018. </p>
      <p>Mr Morei, who is Egyptian, was in court to give his plea. He had the help of an interpreter for the arraignment proceedings.</p>
      <p>A jury of seven men and five women was sworn in to hear the trial, which is due to begin tomorrow afternoon before Ms Justice Carmel Stewart and is expected to last up to two days. <br/><br/>Mr Justice Michael White told the jury that the facts of the offence are not in dispute and they would be summarised by Detective Inspector Martin Beggy of Dundalk Garda Station.</p>
      <p>"The evidence in dispute is in relation to sanity and insanity," he said. </p>
      <p>The judge informed the jury that two consultant forensic psychiatrists from the Central Mental Hospital will give evidence in the case.</p>
