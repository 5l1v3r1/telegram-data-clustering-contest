      <h1>P3.4-million shabu seized from street-level pusher</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:02:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Alexandria San Juan </a></address>
      <p>Some P3.4 million worth of shabu was seized from a woman drug peddler in a buy-bust operation in Quezon City Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Nabbed during the operation was 33-year-old Mary Ann Francisco, alias “Madam,” a resident of Tondo, Manila.</p>
      <p>Authorities said Francisco was involved in the street-level selling of illegal drugs in parts of Metro Manila including Quezon City, prompting them to conduct a drug sting against her.</p>
      <p>Joint operatives of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency-National Capital Region Office (PDEA-NCR), and Quezon City Police District’s Cubao Police Station (PS-7) set the drug bust at the parking lot of Cubao Expo in Araneta Center, Quezon City at around 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>An undercover PDEA agent posed as a buyer and transacted with the suspect resulting in her arrest.</p>
      <p>Seized from Francisco during the bust were 500 grams of white substance suspected to be shabu in a transparent plastic bag with an estimated street value of P3.4 million, a mobile phone used by the suspect in her illegal transactions, and the buy-bust money.</p>
      <p>A case for violation of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 will be filed against Francisco in court.</p>
      <p>A follow-up investigation is now ongoing to trace the source of illegal drugs of the suspect.</p>
