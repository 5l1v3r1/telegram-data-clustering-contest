      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:31:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Halle-Richards, https://www.facebook.com/sophiehrMEN/</a></address>
      <p>After years spent driving all the way to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stockport">Stockport</a> to stock up on tools, the people of <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wythenshawe">Wythenshawe </a>can finally shop a little closer to home.</p>
      <p>Screwfix are celebrating the opening of their brand new <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sharston">Sharston</a> store, which opened last Thursday (December 5).</p>
      <p>Located on Leestone Road, the new store means tradespeople, homeowners and DIYers will no longer have to travel to Cheadle or Stockport.</p>
      <p>The new store could also mean a boost for Wythenshawe charities, thanks to the Screwfix Foundation.</p>
      <p>The foundation has donated more than £4million to local charities and community projects, helping them to enable, fix or maintain facilities.</p>

      <p>Screwfix’s Sharston Store Manager, Janet Green, said: "We chose to open a new store in Sharston to better meet the needs of the local tradespeople.</p>
      <p>"Many of our new customers previously shopped with Screwfix at our Stockport – Higher Hillgate and Cheadle – Stanley Green stores, so we’re delighted to bring Screwfix even closer to them for greater convenience.</p>
      <p>"Our celebration weekend, which ran from Thursday 5th December until Sunday 8th December, attracted hundreds of customers.</p>
      <p>"We have received fantastic support from local homes and from the local community and are looking forward to supporting more busy tradespeople and serious DIYers in Sharston."</p>
      <p>Registered charities local to Sharston are encouraged to apply for funding from the Screwfix Foundation by visiting the branch to pick up a leaflet for more information.</p>
