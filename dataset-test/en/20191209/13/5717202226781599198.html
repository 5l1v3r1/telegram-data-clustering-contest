      <h1>Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa has plenty of praise for Hull City attacker Jarrod Bowen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:46:14+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa has told his pre-Hull City press conference – <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/marcelo-bielsa-live-press-conference-17386982">as per Leeds Live</a> – that Tigers star Jarrod Bowen is a “great attacker” amid rumours over the winger’s future at the KCOM Stadium.</p>
      <p>Bowen, 22, is once again in incredible form this season – improving his numbers on what was a stunning effort last time around. Indeed, Bowen netted 22 goals in 44 Championship fixtures last season. This season he has 16 in 21 games.</p>
      <p>Newcastle United are reportedly very interested in Bowen, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jarrod-bowen-newcastle-hull-city-17334005">as per the Chronicle.</a> Bowen’s current deal expires in the summer, though Hull do have the option to trigger a one-year extension. Hull’s board are willing to reject £20million offers.</p>
      <p>Leeds have been linked in the past with Bowen, and Bielsa has described Bowen as a “great attacker”. The Argentine also complimented the winger’s shooting ability, but stated his side do not have a special plan to cope with Bowen.</p>

      <p>“You know how he plays. This season we can see a lot of good attackers in every team,” <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/marcelo-bielsa-live-press-conference-17386982">Bielsa said</a>. “And in most of the teams, not just those at the top. This is a very good player who unbalances the team. And he scores because he has a good shot.</p>
      <p>“Always we prevent the team how to avoid risk from the opponent when they attack. Our defensive method does not change. What chances is the level of the attacker. He’s a great attacker but we keep working in the same strategy.”</p>
      <p>Leeds have won the last six matches in the Championship, taking them eight points clear of third-placed Fulham. However, West Brom’s 5-1 win over Swansea on Sunday has seen the Baggies return to the top of the division.</p>
      <p>A win for Leeds could see them top, and will do so for at least 24 hours. West Brom travel to Wigan on Wednesday night.</p>
