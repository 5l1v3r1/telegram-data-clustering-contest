      <h1>Jaded Gittins pleads for budget honesty</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:05:34+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/author/david/" target="_blank">Houses and Holes</a></address>
      <p>Via a demoralised <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/please-no-more-pollyanna-impressions-in-the-budget-update-20191208-p53hx0.html">Ross Gittins</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The mid-year budget update we’ll see next Monday presents the government and its econocrats with a threshold question: can their battered credibility withstand one more set of economic forecasts based on little more than naive optimism?<br/><br/>Or won’t it matter if first the industry experts, and then the Quiet Australians in voterland, get the message that budgets are largely works of fiction – based on political spin, with forecasts crafted to fit – and so are not to be believed?<br/><br/>…Three quarters into our run of five weak quarters, Scott Morrison fought the election on a claim to had delivered a Strong Economy. The two subsequent sets of national accounts have destroyed that masterpiece of the marketer’s art.<br/><br/>…But Morrison’s misrepresentations came bolstered by Treasury forecasts and projections showing the economy would quickly recover from weakness to strength, whereupon it would enter a five-year period of above-trend (3 per cent) annual growth before reverting to trend for the rest of a decade.<br/><br/>…See the problem Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and his troops face in preparing next Monday’s mid-year budget update? Do they keep playing the budgetary version of the with-one-bound-our-hero-broke-free game and leave themselves open to growing derision, or do they stop pretending, offer plausible forecasts and adopt a more defensible projection methodology, and start on the long road back to being respected and authoritative?</blockquote>
      <p>They will lie of course.</p>
      <p>Eventually they may be held to account by the ballot box but maybe not. Labor is pretty hopeless. The media is compliant. Murdoch is 100% behind the Government and Nine is lobotimsed by Domain.</p>
      <p>Only MB will hold their feet to the fire.</p>
