      <p>It's one of the "bear" necessities of life.</p>
      <p>A photographer has captured remarkable images of a mother grizzly bear teaching her young cub how to scratch its back in Canada, reports South West News Service, a British news agency.</p>
      <p>German photographer Marion Vollborn took the incredible photos at Taku River in Northern British Columbia, noting that she never expected to see the heart-warming interaction between a mother and child, reminiscent of a scene from the 1967 Disney movie "The Jungle Book."</p>

      <p>"I went to photograph the bears and I travel to Canada once a year to photograph them," Vollborn said in comments obtained by SWNS. "I've pictured bears before but I didn't expect a mother to get so close to me with her cub. I felt incredibly honored and grateful to be able to experience such an intimate moment.</p>
      <p>"I never once felt threatened," Vollborn added.</p>

      <p>Vollborn, who has been photographing nature for 10 years, said she believes the cub is definitely a newborn, possibly as young as "five months old."</p>
      <p>The simple bare necessities, indeed.</p>
