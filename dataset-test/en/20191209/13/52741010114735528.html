      <p>TORONTO — An influential proxy advisory service is recommending shareholders vote against a takeover offer for Hudson's Bay Co. by a group led by the retailer's executive chairman.</p>
      <p>Institutional Shareholder Services raised concerns about the disclosures surrounding the $10.30 per share offer by a group led by HBC executive chairman Richard Baker.</p>
      <p>A rival offer of $11 per share made by Catalyst Capital Group has been rejected by HBC's special committee because it says the Baker-led group, which holds a 57 per cent stake in the retailer, is not interested in selling its shares.</p>
      <p>ISS raised questions about the thoroughness of the sale process and if the agreed transaction maximizes value for minority HBC shareholders.</p>
      <p>However, the special committee at HBC says the ISS report is flawed and urged shareholders to support the offer by the Baker-led group. It pointed to an acknowledgment by ISS that there is meaningful downside risk if shareholders don't approve the deal.</p>
      <p>Catalyst has asked a regulator to block the privatization bid or, at least, require HBC to amend its information circular. The Ontario Securities Commission is scheduled to hear that matter on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 9, 2019.</p>
