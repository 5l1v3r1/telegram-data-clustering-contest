        <b>Wages are high in Switzerland - which is just as well due to the sometimes prohibitive cost of living. But how much on average do Swiss people actually earn - and which jobs are the best paid?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Switzerland has the second-highest average salary in Europe - and the third best in the world. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) figures confirm Switzerland’s status as one of the best countries in the world to earn a salary. </p>
      <p>The OECD Better Life Index ranks Switzerland behind the United States and Luxembourg for average salary - while pay in Switzerland is also well above the average across all the OECD countries. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Switzerland number three globally</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/switzerland/">2019 OECD figures</a>, the Swiss annual disposable income ranks at CHF37,072 per household. </p>
      <p>That’s well above the average of CHF33251 across all OECD countries per household - and is only behind Luxembourg (CHF39,264) and the United States (CHF45,284) on a global scale. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Disposable income is considered by the OECD as a better metric than gross income, as it more accurately reflects the amount of money that an individual or a household has to spend - thereby giving a better indication as to overall quality of life and spending power. </p>
      <p>Disposable income is money taken home after taxes and other compulsory contributions are paid. </p>

      </p>
      <p>While Switzerland may have one of the world’s highest averages, not everyone in Switzerland benefits.</p>
      <p>The OECD findings also show that income inequality is also a concern, with Switzerland ranking 14th out of 40 OECD countries for its wealth gap.</p>
      <p>As noted by the authors, in Switzerland “there is a considerable gap between the richest and poorest – the top 20% of the population earn nearly five times as much as the bottom 20%.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which jobs rank the best?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the OECD doesn’t rank earnings per job, <a href="https://www.ofv.ch/sachbuch/detail/lohnbuch-schweiz-2019/103761/">the 2019 Swiss Wage Book (Lohnbuch Schweiz 2019)</a> provides an occupation-by-occupation break down. </p>
      <p>The highest average wage for a common job - i.e. not a specialist positions or as CEO - is CHF110,000-130,000 gross per year. </p>
      <p>Earning slightly less are people in IT, where the average is 117,000 francs per annum. </p>
      <p>Lawyers in Switzerland earn an average of 111,600 per year, coming in at third place. </p>
      <p>There are some more specialist positions with a higher annual wage - although these jobs are a little harder to come by. Diplomats in Switzerland earn around CHF162,660 on average - good work if you can get it. </p>

      <p>
        <b>And the rest?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Teachers in Switzerland earn an average of CHF87,500 gross - although this varies widely between cantons.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, a teacher earns an average of CHF97,000 - while in Ticino that amount is CHF66,000. </p>
      <p>Civil servants average CHF85,800, which is roughly the same as a journalist or editor. </p>
      <p>Towards the lower end of the scale, taxi drivers are one of the lowest paid in Switzerland - earning 38,000 per month gross.</p>
      <p>That’s a a decrease of 15 percent over the past decade, the biggest decline of any job in Switzerland. </p>
