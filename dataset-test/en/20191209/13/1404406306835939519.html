      <p>Suge Knight hopped on Nick Cannon's official Eminem diss track, "The Invitation," which he dropped today (December 9). The Hitmaka-produced track also features Hitman Holla, Charlie Clips and Prince Eazy.</p>
      <p>Suge Knight starts out the track in a phone call to Nick that was recorded from jail, where he states, "You know I don't do no talking, but Nick is family," adding "Eminem's a b*tch!" </p>
      <p>Nick then rhymes on the track, "Call Kim, somebody get Hailey and that other kid you raising that ain't even your baby. Took a page out of Drake book, this might get a Grammy/We going back to back until you respond—on the family/My baby mama killed you off a decade ago/You still crying about it b*tch, now who really the hoe?"</p>
