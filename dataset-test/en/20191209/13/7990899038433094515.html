      <p>Former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) <b>Preet Bharara</b> mocked the GOP’s lead counsel for his defense of President <b>Donald Trump</b> during impeachment hearings on Monday.</p>
      <p>“In August 2016, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. published an op-ed in <i>The Hill</i> criticizing candidate Trump,” noted Republican attorney <b>Steve Castor</b>. “Other senior Ukrainian officials called Trump a ‘clown’ and other words.”</p>
      <p>Castor was roundly criticized on Twitter for intoning with great pathos over the relatively mild insult from several years ago.</p>
      <p>“Dear Mr. Castor: Calling Trump a clown is NOT foreign election interference,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PreetBharara/status/1204087589562703874">Bharara tweeted</a>. “It is a correct consensus opinion and also an insult to actual clowns.”</p>

      <p>Bharara was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/us/politics/preet-bharara-us-attorney.html">famously fired</a> by Trump.</p>
      <p>Castor’s clown reference was in regards to a long-since-deleted Twitter post by retired Ukrainian diplomat <b>Arsen Avakov</b>, who also said Trump was “<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/russia-ukraine-trump-manafort-232101">an even bigger danger to the U.S. than terrorism</a>.”</p>
      <p>Other commentators were quick to poke fun at Castor after he got the early afternoon vapors over the arguably anodyne remark:</p>

      <p>Twitter collectively continued to pile on with clown-based put-downs of Castor, Trump and the GOP writ large–decidedly a bad day for users with coulrophobia.</p>
      <p>The clown insult has been a source of alleged consternation for the 45th president’s erstwhile defenders for quite some time.</p>
      <p>In November, conservative author <b>Byron York</b> wrote <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-what-if-trump-was-right-about-ukraine">a lengthy apologia</a> in service of the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election for the <i>Washington Examiner</i>.</p>
      <p>York relayed the story of the Avakov insult under the histrionic heading: “Government ministers attack.”</p>
