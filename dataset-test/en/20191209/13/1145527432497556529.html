        <b>Positive hiring outlook was reported in sectors like healthcare &amp; pharmaceuticals, information technology, e-commerce and tech start-ups, educational services, KPO, power and energy, and logistics</b>
      </p>
      <p>India is expected to witness a marginal 7 per cent rise in job creation in the October-March period of this financial year, as subdued economic conditions have dampened employment outlook, a report said on Monday.</p>
      <p>According to TeamLease's bi-annual Employment Outlook Report for HY2 2019, economic reforms lifted the spirits for seven of the 19 sectors surveyed, while nine sectors reported a decrease in their outlook for October-March period of this fiscal.</p>
      <p>India will witness a 7.12 per cent increase in job creation in the current half year (October-March, 2019-20), it said.</p>
      <p>Positive hiring outlook was reported in sectors like healthcare &amp; pharmaceuticals, information technology, e-commerce and tech start-ups, educational services, KPO, power and energy, and logistics.</p>
      <p>The sectors that are expected to witness decrease in hiring include manufacturing, engineering and infrastructure, construction and real estate, financial services, retail, BPO/ITeS, telecommunications, travel and hospitality, FMCG and agriculture and agrochemicals.</p>
      <p>"Though the lowering of the GDP growth projection seems to have dampened the net employment outlook in some of the sectors, the job creation across sectors is on a growth trajectory," TeamLease Services co-founder &amp; Executive Vice President Rituparna Chakraborty said.</p>
      <p>She further noted that "8 out of the 19 sectors are expected to witness a double digit rise in job creation. Logistics and educational services alone will add 14.36 per cent more jobs during the period October-March, 2019-20 indicating the dip in the net employment outlook to be more of a passing phase."</p>
      <p>While Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Gurgaon, Kolkata indicated positive sentiment, Indore, Coimbatore, Ahmedabad, Kochi and Nagpur exhibited varying levels of negative sentiment for October-March 2019-20 period compared to April-September 2019-20.</p>
      <p>As per the report, global markets witnessed a drop in net employment outlook for the October-March period.</p>
      <p>Europe saw the most significant drop in net employment outlook, followed by Africa and the Americas.</p>
      <p>The Middle East (no change) and APAC (up 1 per cent) weathered global headwinds and stayed strong, the report said.</p>
      <p>TeamLease Employment Outlook analyses functional and environmental aspects across 19 sectors and 14 geographies to provide an in-depth insight into the hiring sentiments.</p>
      <p>It surveyed 744 enterprises of various sizes (small, medium and large) in India and 76 employers across the globe to evaluate employment outlook trends.</p>
