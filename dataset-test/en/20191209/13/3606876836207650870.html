      <p>Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Monday evening suffered a setback after Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti ruled he should spend two more days behind bars before his bail application is listened.</p>
      <p>Ogoti's ruling effectively sent Sonko back to Prison where he is said to have escaped while an inmate at Shimo la Tewa Prison.</p>
      <p>The Chief Magistrate ruled that Sonko's request for medical assistance should be handled by a prison doctor and the results handed to him on Wednesday when he will make the ruling.</p>
      <p>While pleading to be released on bail, Sonko had told the court that he was in need of medical treatment after sustaining injuries during his dramatic arrest on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Governor has been held at the Kilimani Police Station which has much better conditions when compared to the remand prison where he will be staying Monday and Tuesday nights.</p>
      <p>The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said the state was opposed to Sonko's bail applications - claiming the Governor had previously escaped prison.</p>
      <p>The DPP has also sought Sonko to be barred from accessing his office if indeed he is granted bail.</p>
      <p>Ogoti will rule on the matter on Wednesday.</p>
