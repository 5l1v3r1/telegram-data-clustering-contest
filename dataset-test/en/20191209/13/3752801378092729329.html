      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/new-zealand.html">New Zealand</a>'s most active volcano erupted violently on Monday with at least five people killed and 10 still trapped on White Island.</p>
      <p>Here's all you need to know about the deadly volcano eruption:</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is the island volcano?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The volcano on New Zealand's tourist White Island is the most active volcano in the country.</p>
      <p>About 70% of the volcano is under the sea and at least 10 000 people go to see it every year.</p>
      <p>The White Island, also known by its Maori name Whakaari, is about 50km from the east coast of North Island. </p>
      <p>The volcano's last fatal eruption was in 1914 when it killed 12 sulphur miners. White Island became a private scenic reserve in 1953.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What happened at the volcano?</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Monday at about 2pm local time the volcano erupted killing at least one person and leaving about two dozen still trapped on the tourist island.</p>
      <p>GeoNet agency, which had been monitoring the rumbling volcano, raised its alert level to four out of a maximum five. The White Island is about 50km from the east coast of North Island.</p>
      <p>The "short-lived eruption" threw an ash plume about 3 658m high, New Zealand's geoscience agency GNS Science said in a statement, adding there were no current signs of an escalation.</p>
      <p>The eruptions also sent debris into the air. Video emerged of some visitors stuck in a crater, while rescue operations were on hold until conditions became safe.</p>
      <p>The images showed smoke first engulfing the top of the crater and then the entire island.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who was on the island?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police initially said there were 100 people on or near the island, then later revised down the number to 50.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there were "a number" of tourists in the vicinity, both from New Zealand and overseas. Those injured - numbering about 20 - suffered burns.</p>
      <p>Police said number of missing people on the island was "in double digits".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Was the eruption expected?</b>
      </p>
      <p>GeoNet warned on December 3 that "the volcano may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal".</p>
      <p>But the geological hazard monitoring website added "the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors".</p>
      <p>Several eruptions have taken place on White Island over the years. The most recent in 2016 left no one hurt.</p>
