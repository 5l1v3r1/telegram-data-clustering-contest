      <h1>Game Of Thrones snubbed from Golden Globes 2020 again with only one nomination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:51:48+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Tilly Pearce</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game Of Thrones</a>’ final season has been sensationally snubbed from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/golden-globes-2020-nominations-irishman-marriage-story-1917-honoured-11479011/">this year’s Golden Globes nominations</a> – meaning it will now never win the Drama TV series gong.</p>
      <p>The show has been previously nominated five times for the award, but has been pipped at the post every time by other shows in their categories.</p>
      <p>After failing to get a nomination last year either, this upcoming 2020 ceremony was the last time the HBO fantasy series would qualify – and instead it missed out.</p>
      <p>Big Little Lies, The Crown, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/killing-eve/">Killing Eve</a>, The Morning Show and Succession will now battle it out for the award instead.</p>
      <p>In previous years, Game Of Thrones has been beaten by Handmaid’s Tale (2017), The Crown (2016), Mr Robot (2015), The Affair (2014) and Homeland (2012).</p>
      <p>While the series as a whole has been passed by, one of the actors have been given a nod by the board, with Kit Harington up for Best Actor Award for his role as Jon Snow.</p>

      <p>After getting used to facing white walkers and the Battle of the Bastards, surely Tobias Menzies (The Crown), Billy Porter (Pose), Brian Cox (Succession) and Rami Malek (Mr Robot) will be a breeze?</p>
      <p>But apart from that, that’s it for the former reigning champion of epic TV.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chernobyl has been given four nominations, and The Crown and Fleabag have three each.</p>
