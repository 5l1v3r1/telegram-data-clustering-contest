      <p>While Andy Whyment, Roman Kemp and Kate Garraway have appeared on various television shows talking about their time in the jungle, fans are still waiting to hear from winner Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>She has been very quiet since <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/jenkins-suzuki-mitsubishi-garages-cardiff-17387208">being reunited with her daughters </a>Ella, four, and one-year-old Mia.</p>
      <p>Runners up Andy Whyment and Roman Kemp were both interviewed on breakfast shows.</p>
      <p>Andy revealed he had not been given much time between the live final and coming for the interviews.</p>
      <p>He said it had been a "mad old day" since the winner was announced, and he had only been given half an hour to take a shower after leaving the jungle.</p>
      <p>He said on Twitter: "Back with the family, what an amazing experience I had in the jungle. I just wanted to say thank you so much with all my heard for everyone who voted for me. You don't know how much it means to me finishing second, thanks."</p>

      <p>Kate, who came fourth, joined him on Good Morning Britain said: "I'm so pleased I did it, it was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>"You know when you watch the show and think 'That looks really hard, I could never do it', and it was really hard and I couldn't really do it!"</p>
      <p>DJ Roman Kemp, who came third, was on Lorraine to talk about his time.</p>
      <p>But Jacqueline had not made any appearances yet and it has been all quiet on social media, since her husband Dan Osborne congratulated his wife.</p>

      <p>He wrote on Instagram: "My jungle Queen!! Words can not describe how proud I am of this woman!</p>
      <p>"She absolutely smashed it from day 1 and deserves this sooo much!! Well done baby."</p>
      <p>The former The Only Way Is Essex star flew out to Australia to greet his wife as she left the jungle as their marriage was the subject of tabloid headlines.</p>
      <p>While she was in the jungle, her campmate and Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson reportedly told her that Osborne cheated on her with Stephenson's ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>Osborne and Allen were previously in the Celebrity Big Brother house together.</p>
      <p>However, Osborne and Jossa embraced and posed for photographs together after she crossed the bridge to leave the show.</p>

      <p>Stephenson wrote on his Instagram story that Jossa deserved to win from day one, adding: "So proud of my lil sister."</p>
      <p>Their fellow campmate Caitlyn Jenner also celebrated with her, writing: "Congratulations to my sweet friend @jacjossa witnessing your growth on this show was amazing! Congrats Jungle Jack!"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, fellow camper Kate Garraway wrote: "She did it!!! All hail the jungle queen - love ya @jacjossa... now go cuddle your babies!"</p>
      <p>Just before she won, she told hosts Ant and Dec: "It was not what I expected.</p>
      <p>"It was a lot harder. I didn't think it would be such a turning point in life, I went in as one person, I feel like I have come out as a different person.</p>
      <p>"I've grown in confidence and found who I am as a person."</p>
      <p>She added: "I think it's so easy to care so much what other people think of you, trolls, people who say nasty things for the sake of it and I try to change their opinion.</p>
      <p>"Here you have no choice, you have to be you. Here I have different people bigging me up of different ages, I can't really work out what is happening.</p>
      <p>"I've always been known as Lauren from EastEnders, or a doormat, or whatever you want to call it, and coming here I have actually proved myself."</p>
      <p>The finale was watched by an average of 9.1 million viewers, according to overnight figures from ITV.</p>
      <p>The peak viewing figure was 10 million.</p>
      <p>This number is down from last year's finale, won by Harry Redknapp, where an average of 10.9 million viewers tuned in overnight to watch the football boss take the title.</p>
