        <i>March 21- April 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>You don't need to go anywhere today to enjoy your day and seem perfectly happy at home with loved ones. You want to help a friend in need but your own circumstances hinder you. There may be other ways you can help them. Be creative about this. Environmental conditions appear to have a strong influence on your state of mind and ability to handle work-related tasks. Arguments, confusion and frequent upheavals at work play havoc with your nervous system.</p>

        <b>Taurus</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>April 20-May 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>If you want to share your knowledge and passion today you are more likely to get the message across via a more soulful approach rather than dry intellectual persuasion. You will want to socialize and talk with people you have common interests and ideals with. More positive feedback from others is assured through loving gestures even if what you have to say now is 'technically' correct. Clearing up problems or misunderstandings in relationships can be on the schedule now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gemini</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>May 21-June 21</i>
      </p>
      <p>You're a bit restless and unsettled today. Mercury, your ruler, shifts to the audacious sign of Sagittarius today. You've set your standards too high and maybe disappointed when you actually learn the truth. Apply this to financial matters. You're feeling inadequate because you're creatively blocked. Explore new ways of seeing and doing things. Maybe you're caught between conflicting estimates. Be sure you know the real cost before you get involved in any projects.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>June 22-July 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Your monetary situation is subject to extreme fluctuations at present and your mind is definitely thinking of strategies for stabilising this. The Moon which rules your Sun sign is in high spirits today being in its exaltation sign. You may be the recipient of a gift or possibly even may gain through inheritance, alimony, or insurance benefits. Try expanding your view and investigating alternative financial propositions and strategies to secure your long-term future needs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>July 23-August 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Commitment to beliefs pays off right now. You want freedom now and will break free of your routine as the Sun continues to transit Sagittarius. You can do some excellent charity or volunteer work as spiritual concerns hold hidden opportunities. Utilise this positive power of visualization because it's time to deal with the inner-world more than the outer world. Picture the outcomes that you want and then make them happen. Stop wearing your heart on your sleeve and believing everything others tell you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>August 23-September 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>You have to assert yourself in some situations especially if others are taking advantage of you. Your ruler moves to the dual sign of Sagittarius. This could put you in two minds over some decision. You might need to posture if someone's taking your friendship and goodwill for granted today. If you are confined to a location you must make the best of it. Once out and about and appreciate what you have a little more. You can also introduce aesthetics and creative flair into your work.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Libra</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>September 23-October 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Your sentimentality will be enhanced as your ruling planet Venus makes a favourable contact with the powerful Moon today. Marital issues dominate your mental and emotional landscape currently. On the one hand, you can enjoy the company of the one you love but beneath the surface are subtle dissatisfactions that need to be addressed. You can become a lot more certain your feelings now and although you've been hurt in the past, your trust level is starting to lift.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scorpio</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>October 23 â€“ November 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mars causes you to manifest your dreams now. Don't be afraid to tackle the "impossible". If you aren't able to control yourself you may find this an excuse for doing the wrong thing. Containment and impulse control are keywords today which will hold you in good stead. Take off your rose-coloured glasses if you're out on the town. Your family and friends will support and help you see a different perspective. There are three words to describe your health situation: Improvement, Sex, and Sensuality.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sagittarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>November 23-December 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>You are taking more control of your inner feelings as Saturn moves closer towards your ruler, Pluto. This is a cycle in your life when you need to concentrate your efforts. If you are the least bit sloppy or off-track, you can find yourself frustrated by delays or even failures. Ask yourself if what you are doing is really necessary. Are the methods you are using the most efficient and effective? If the answer is yes to both of these questions, you have the chance to accomplish very important things.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Capricorn</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>December 21-January 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>As Jupiter and the South node connect, you are less concerned about money and more focused on doing what you love. You can be in an adventurous mood and want to share your feelings mutually. Maybe you only want to flirt but it sure feels good to be playful and not so restrained. Feelings of attraction could come up quickly but unfortunately, may leave you just as fast. It's hard to predict where relationships will end up, so have fun and experiment for a while. You are idealistic now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aquarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>January 20-February 18</i>
      </p>
      <p>Your willpower is intensified with Pluto positively influencing your ruling planet Saturn now. Carrying out your day to day routine will be more pleasant during this period however, you could be presented with challenges of a financial nature. Don't let things slip by your attention and if you need to talk to your bank manager now's the time to get a better deal on your interest rate. Don't be afraid to be spontaneous in your personal life either. Friends may not understand you but this is your life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pisces</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>February 19-March 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>You may have every reason under the Sun for being somewhat aggressive in your approach; however by remaining composed you give yourself a greater edge in the negotiation. In not playing the game by the rules, others set you to determine your own. Before making a decision on a personal matter you need to get all your ducks in a row before making an appropriate choice. You also mustn't forget that friends are human. Your expectations are out of proportion with what's possible.</p>
