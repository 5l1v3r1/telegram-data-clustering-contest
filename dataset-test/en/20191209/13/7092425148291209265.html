          <b>Amanda Holden has waded into the ongoing speculation that Phillip Schofield is difficult to work with.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The<i> Britain's Got Talent</i> star, who famously had a feud with Phil after he reportedly blocked her from co-hosting <i>This Morning</i> with him, was asked about <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/morning-presenters-complain-phillip-schofields-attitude-amid-reports-tensions-set-345952"><b><i>reports things are tense with between him and Holly when the cameras aren't rolling.</i></b></a></p>
      <p>The Sun also claims Ruth Langsford has submitted an official complaint about Phil after he "cut her off" live on air.</p>

        <figcaption>Holden has publicly shown her support for Ruth Langsford following reports at that weekend that Ruth has issued a 'formal complaint' about This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield</figcaption>

      <p>Speaking on Heart Radio, Ashley Roberts said: "Lots of buzz around Phillip Schofield at the moment.</p>
      <p>"There are reports that things are a little tense between him and Holly Willoughby as well as Ruth Langsford.</p>
      <p>"ITV says it's just gossip and that he and Holly are great friends, both on and off screen."</p>
      <p>Digging for information, Amanda's co-host Jamie Theakston joked: "If only there was someone here who might be able to help us with that story..."</p>
      <p>Never one to sit in silence, Amanda replied: "Listen, I've drawn a line under all those issues with Philip...</p>
      <p>"Well, I'm just gonna say that I really admire anyone that sticks up for themselves because it is not an easy thing to do.</p>
      <p>"There is a tin opener and there's a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener. That's all I'm saying."</p>
      <p>Last week a mystery household name spilled to The Sun: "For so long people have been silenced because they are scared for their job.</p>
      <p>"If they speak out publicly about the atmosphere they fear there could be repercussions."</p>

      <p>A former colleague of Phillip's added: "He is very jealous of Holly, who has remained a nice person despite her success."</p>
      <p>Holly and Phil are said to have locked horns behind the scenesTrying to pour cold water on the claims, This Morning Editor Martin Frizell added: "We have the smartest viewers watching telly and believe me they would be the first to notice any issues â€” they haven't because there are none."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for ITV said: "It's deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.</p>
      <p>"Phillip is a much-respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise.</p>
      <p>"Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike."</p>
