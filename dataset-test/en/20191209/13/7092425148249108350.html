      <p>I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here 2019 winner <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/jacqueline-jossa-crowned-winner-im-celeb-2019-346167"><i>Jacqueline Jossa</i></a> won't be doing interviews following recent reports about husband Dan Osborne.</p>
      <p>Usually, the winner of the ITV series gives an interview on breakfast talk shows like Lorraine or Good Morning Britain, but today, Lorraine confirmed this won't be the case with Jacqueline.</p>
      <p>On Monday's episode, Lorraine was interviewing radio host <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/roman-kemp-see-biggest-instagram-increase-since-leaving-im-celeb-reveals-data-346187"><i>Roman Kemp</i></a>, who finished third on the series, when she asked: "Can we talk about little Jacqueline who's Queen of the Jungle?"</p>

      <p>Roman replied: "I know she's not doing interviews, I sincerely hope she's in a bubble bath with a glass of something fizzy."</p>
      <p>Lorraine's comment comes after recent claims that Dan had a threesome with former Celebrity Big Brother co-stars Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling last year.</p>
      <p>He denied the allegations at the time and is planning on taking legal action against the tabloid reports.</p>

      <p>Recent rumours have also suggested that Dan had a fling with Myles Stephenson's ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>
