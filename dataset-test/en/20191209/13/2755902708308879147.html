      <p>In a very disturbing development,  five Zimbabweans, including two children were killed after a Johannesburg bound Toyota Quantum collided with a Ford Fiesta near Musina, Limpopo Province in South Africa, on Friday night.</p>
      <p>According to sources who spoke to the <a href="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/horror-crash-on-road-to-johannesburg-untimely-end-for-zimbabwean-children/">Chronicle</a>, the children are alleged to have had no proper documentation and had been smuggled into the neighbouring country to spend the festive season with their parents. This comes at a time when ordinary Zimbabweans seeking travel documents to leave the country are enduring nightmares as the country has stopped issuing passports as a result of foreign currency shortages.</p>
      <p>Limpopo Province Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the incident and said that drunken driving was the suspected cause of the accident.</p>
      <aside>The South African Police Service in Musina are investigating a case of culpable homicide which took place on December 6, 2019 at about 2200 hours along the N1 road between Beitbridge and Musina policing area.<br/>A white Quantum with registration number HO54SDGP, pulling a trailer was from Zimbabwe with 25 passengers going to Johannesburg. Among the passengers, there were some kids. The Ford Fiesta vehicle registration number JG71KRGP was from Johannesburg to Zimbabwe with the driver Mr Farai Hunyei and one passenger.<br/>Along the N1 road after Baobab Tollgate the above vehicles had a head-on collision, the driver in the Ford Fiesta died at the scene and his passenger died in hospital. The driver was identified as Mr Farai Hunyei from Zimbabwe. Two passengers in the Quantum died at the scene and their driver Mr Emmanuel Sibanda, also from Zimbabwe died in hospital. The total number of fatalities is five.</aside>
