      <h1>'Hour of Code' Demystifies Computer Programming for Kids</h1>

      <p>From banking to basic communication, <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/inside-computer.htm">computers</a> wind their way through virtually every aspect of our modern lives. But in the United States, <a href="https://www.governing.com/columns/tech-talk/gov-a-time-for-code.html">most schools don't teach</a> fundamental computer science, even at a time when demand for computer-savvy professionals <a href="https://appliedcomputing.wisconsin.edu/about-applied-computing/computer-science-jobs/">far outstrips supply</a>. This educational deficiency leaves kids completely clueless about how their own digital devices (which they're often glued to) work.</p>
      <p>That glaring gap inspired the project Hour of Code. Hour of Code (offered by the nonprofit Code.org) gives children a peek into the world of coding through easy, fun coding tasks, which expose them to the problem-solving skills and limitless potential of computer programming. Activities are designed to be <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us#">completed within an hour</a>, though, of course, a student can go on to perform multiple tasks.</p>
      <p>The first Hour of Code event happened during Computer Science Education Week in December 2013, the brainchild of Iranian-American brothers <a href="https://code.org/about">Hadi Partovi and Ali Partovi</a>, who decided that someone needed to do more to spark interest in coding.</p>
      <p>The initial event was a massive success, engaging roughly 20 million people who wrote hundreds of millions of lines of code. It was soon followed by a now-famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc">YouTube video</a> featuring some of the biggest names in tech, who shared that their own early forays into programming were simple tasks, like creating shapes or questionnaires.</p>
      <p>Now, anyone can organize an <a href="https://csedweek.org/educate/hoc">Hour of Code event</a>, which takes place the second week of each December. The curriculum and associated resources <a href="https://code.org/about">are totally free</a>, tutorials are available in 20 languages, and some can be done even without a computer, smartphone or other device. Anyone from kindergarteners to adults can participate, and events can even be planned outside of this time frame.</p>
      <p>Hour of Code promoters don't claim that a few hours of coding will turn anyone into a computer scientist. But they do think that it's beneficial to society as a whole when the inner workings of computers are demystified, and when young people have a better grasp of creative problem solving.</p>
      <p>To find Hour of Code activities in your state or country, go to <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/events/all">Hour of Code</a>. Or you can simply use the <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/learn">free tutorials</a>.</p>
      <h3>NOW THAT'S INTERESTING</h3>
      <p>Although the computer industry is dominated by males, the <a href="https://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-figures/this-enchantress-numbers-was-worlds-first-computer-programmer.htm">first computer programmer</a> was a 19th-century British mathematician named Ada Lovelace. She created an algorithm that's been described as the world's first computer code. Another pioneering female programmer, <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us">Admiral Grace Murray Hopper</a>, has a birthday on Dec. 9. In tribute, Computer Science Education Week is always held in the second week of December.</p>
