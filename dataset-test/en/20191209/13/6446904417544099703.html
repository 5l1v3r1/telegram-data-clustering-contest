      <p>In Maliks Tandoori Restaurant, inspectors found that the “standard of cleaning” was poor. “There were cobwebs, spiders and insects such as woodlouse present throughout the kitchen and the ancillary facilities,” inspectors noted. </p>

      <p>Under the FSAI Act 1998, a closure order is served where it is deemed that there is or there is likely to be a grave and immediate danger to public health at or in the premises; or where an improvement order is not complied with.</p>
      <p>Closure orders can refer to the immediate closure of all or part of the food premises, or all or some of its activities, but can be lifted once a food premises is found to be compliant.</p>
      <p>Dr Pamela Byrne, the Chief Executive of the FSAI, called the closure orders “totally unacceptable”. </p>
      <p>Some of closures lasted a few days, while other premises remain closed. </p>
      <p>“The presence of rodents and other pests presents a grave and immediate danger to consumers’ health and food businesses must put in place more robust pest control systems,” she said. </p>
      <p>“These operators are damaging the reputation of the food industry as we enter one of the busiest months of the year,” she said. </p>
