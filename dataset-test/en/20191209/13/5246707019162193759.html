      <p>Last month, we took Shin'en Multimedia's latest Switch release <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst"><b>The Touryst</b></a> for a good spin for review. <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/touryst">We came away mightily impressed</a>, partly thanks to the variety and all of the surprises on offer as you explore the game, but also because of its striking visual style and its flawless performance across both docked and handheld modes.</p>
      <p>The tech wizards at Digital Foundry have now shared their view on the title, too, going as far as to describe it as "a revelation". The praise comes in response to the game's "ridiculously fast" bootup sequence and its general lack of loading screens; the game only takes up 231MB of storage, with its procedurally-generated assets help to save both time and space.</p>
      <p>The kind words continue when talking about the game's frame rate. Digital Foundry says that it "aims to deliver 60 frames per second and it rarely falters", going on to call it "one of the most stable games of the generation and... absolutely on par with the best that Nintendo itself has to offer". You can see all of this spoken about in more detail, and much more besides, in the full video below.</p>

      <p>After <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx"><b>Fast RMX</b></a>, a Switch launch title with similarly impressive technical performance, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Shin'en Multimedia appears to have got Switch development down to a tee.</p>
