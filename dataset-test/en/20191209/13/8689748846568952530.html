      <h3>Ghana’s finest contemporary rapper, Sarkodie for once has added his voice to the popular perception about him that his life is built on pride and arrogance.</h3>
      <p>To the best knowledge of Sarkodie, it’s high time those with the erroneous perception about him considered building self-confidence. To him, anyone with self-confidence thinks differently perhaps in a mature manner.</p>
      <p>Sarkodie tweeted that;</p>
      <p>”Yo quick one: y’all allow females call men “Too Known” it’s cute but no man n I repeat no man should tell a fellow man “You are too known” … You violating G code big time … that’s some girly sh## build your confidence as a man and you will see things differently.“</p>
      <p>“How on earth a man with balls standing in a corner looking at a fellow man saying *with a soft voice “This guy he de see en body oo” Build your confidence oo nny3 saa someone de cough sef you go bore,” – Sarkodie added.</p>
