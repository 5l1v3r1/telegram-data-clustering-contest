        <b>England players will wear black armbands during the first Test of their tour of South Africa in honour of former bowler Bob Willis.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Willis, who captained England before turning to punditry, spending more than 20 years with Sky Sports, after retirement in 1984, died last week at the age of 70.</p>
      <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board announced its plans to pay tribute to England's fourth-highest wicket-taker of all time at SuperSport Park in Centurion later this month.</p>
      <p>An ECB spokesperson said: "The team will wear black armbands in the first Test in South Africa as a tribute to Bob Willis."</p>
      <p>The first Test begins on Boxing Day as part of a four-match series against the Proteas, followed by three one-day internationals and three T20 clashes.</p>
