      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Photographer John Kraus took a photo of a rocket using his iPhone XS Max.</li>
        <li>The rocket was a SpaceX CRS-19.</li>
        <li>The photo looks better than a phone has any right to produce.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the tech world we're all guilty of chasing the latest, hottest, flashiest, and fastest thing. This year that's iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. But that's unfair to iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. Until 2019, they were the best iPhones ever made. And photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnkrausphotos/">John Kraus</a> has reminded us (via <a href="https://512pixels.net/2019/12/iphone-xs-max-rocket-photography/">512Pixels</a>) just <a href="https://www.imore.com/photographers-review-iphone-xr-and-iphone-xs-cameras">how good their cameras are</a>, too.</p>
      <p>Kraus took his iPhone XS Max and placed it near the launch site of SpaceX's CRS-19 rocket. The result is a shot that looks highly impressive and reminds us once again that perhaps we don't really need the latest iPhone in order to take some amazing shots.</p>

      <p>Now admittedly this isn't going to make me trade my iPhone 11 Pro in for a used iPhone XS. But if you're still on the fence about upgrading, this might make you think twice. Especially if you've been happy with your iPhone XS and its photography prowess to this point.</p>

I think so, and I'll tell you why Apple has been accused of scrimping on storage by continuing to sell a 64GB version of its flagship iPhones. But 64GB is plenty for me, and here's why I think it might be plenty for you, too.</a>
