      <p>A video of an elephant crossing train tracks by lifting a level crossing gate surfaced on Twitter and has gone viral ever since. The over-one minute clip has been shared on Twitter by Susanta Nanda of the Indian Forest Service or IFS.</p>
      <p>The elephant made a risky attempt to cross the train tracks in Jalpaiguri and fortunately succeeded. It appears from the video that nobody was present to operate the level crossing gate near the tracks. That didn't deter the elephant's attempt at all because it effortlessly lifted the level crossing gate and crossed the tracks.</p>
      <p>It, thereafter, crossed the second level-crossing gate as well. In his caption for the video, Susanta Nanda said, "Level crossing or the train line won't stop this elephant to migrate. They remember their routes very well, passed from one generation to another. Interestingly, different techniques at both the ends."</p>
      <p>Watch the video here:</p>

      <p>The video has already been viewed over 32,000 times so far while the internet expressed concern for the elephant in the comments section. "It's fortunate that no train was running at that time. Could have easily resulted in horrible tragedy," a user wrote.</p>

      <p>The internet's concern is valid considering that <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/train-hits-critically-injures-elephant-north-bengal-video-viral-1603840-2019-09-27">an elephant was left critically injured in September this year</a> as the engine of a train hit the animal while it was trying to cross the tracks in a jungle in Jalpaiguri.</p>
