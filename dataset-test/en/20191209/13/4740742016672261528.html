      <p>A report of a gunman on a Bristol street last week is uncorroborated, police say.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/live-armed-police-totterdown-gun-3608699">At least four police cars</a> and eight officers were seen onÂ <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/totterdown">Wells Road</a>, opposite the Banco Lounge cafe in Totterdown, at 3pm on December 4.</p>
      <p>An Avon and Somerset Constabulary spokeswoman said at the time: "Patrolling officers and specialist firearms officers were deployed to Firfield Street, Totterdown, after an anonymous caller reported seeing someone with a gun in the street."</p>
      <p>Now the spokeswoman has told <i>Bristol Live</i>: "There are no further lines of enquiry at this time.</p>
      <p>"Officers responded to an anonymous call reporting having seen someone with a gun. No one corroborated the allegation and no weapon was found following a search."</p>
      <p>It is understood officers searched a house on Wells Road at around 3.30pm on December 4, but the tenants were allowed back in soon afterwards.</p>
      <p>Police left the scene at around 3.45pm.</p>
