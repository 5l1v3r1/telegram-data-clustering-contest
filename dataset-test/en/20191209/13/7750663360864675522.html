      <h1>West Ham United considering Darren Randolph reunion?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/middlesbrough/"><b>Middlesbrough</b></a> goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/darren-randolph/"><b>Darren Randolph</b></a> has reportedly emerged as a transfer target for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-ham-united/"><b>West Ham United</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 32-year-old has previously represented the Hammers, making 42 appearances in all competitions before departing for the Riverside Stadium in 2017.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>90 min</i>, the Premier League outfit have contacted Middlesbrough regarding a deal for the Republic of Ireland international.</p>
      <p>Having made a number of high-profile mistakes since joining West Ham in the summer, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergi-roberto/"><b>Sergi Roberto</b></a> is likely to be moved on in January, providing that the east Londoners can sign a replacement.</p>
      <p>While Randolph currently has just over 18 months remaining on his contract, Boro may have to consider cashing in on the experienced stopper.</p>
      <p>The north-east team currently sit in 19th position in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/championship/2019-20/">Championship standings</a>.</p>
