      <h1>2K's Newly-Formed Studio is Working on the Next Bioshock Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:27:08+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>A new <i>Bioshock</i> game is officially in the works. Announced by 2K earlier today, the new title is being developed by a new internal studio dubbed Cloud Chamber.</p>
      <p>While official news of a new game has been well-received, it seems like we’ll be waiting a while to see the fruit of cloud chamber’s labours. In a press release issued earlier today, the publisher confirmed that the new game “will be in development for the next several years.” Speaking to <a href="https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber">IGN</a>, studio head Kelley Gilmore said that the developer is at “the earlier end of our process.”</p>
      <p>A statement from 2K president David Ismalier confirms that the main pillars of the series - powerful narrative and FPS gameplay - will return in its latest iteration. There’s no word, however, on when or where the new game will be set, or whether it will be a direct sequel or a reboot.</p>
