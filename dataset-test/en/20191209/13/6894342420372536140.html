      <h1>Sony PlayStation 5 Pro Reportedly Possible In Next Console Lifecycle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:23:39+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/john/" target="_blank">John Law</a></address>
      <p>Come next year, Sony will officially be launching its next-generation PlayStation 5 (PS5) console, thus resetting the console generation once again. Recently though, the Japanese electronics corporation suggested that a “Pro” version of the PS5 is likely to happen sometime in the console’s lifecycle.</p>
      <p>The topic about the possibility of a PS5 Pro came up during an interview between Game Informer and Masayasu Ito, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s (SIE) Executive VP of Hardware Engineering and Operation. During the conversation, Ito spoke at length as to how – due to the speed at which technology is advancing today – console lifecycles now sit between a period of six and seven years.</p>
      <p>Ito continues to explain that because of the advancement speed, Sony should be able to “change the hardware itself and try to incorporate advancement in technology”. Such is the case of the PS4 Pro; basically a souped-up version of the original PS4, the PS4 Pro arrived on to the scene in 2016, bringing with it improved hardware that supported 4K gaming, among other features.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that the idea of the PS5 Pro has manifest online. Several months ago, the Japanese journalist, Zenji Nishikawa alleged that Sony was planning on launching the PS5 Pro alongside the non-Pro version of the console. That said, there’s not a whole lot of information to back up Nishikawa’s statement, so it’s best to take his claims with a dash of salt.</p>
      <p>In any case, we’ll just have to wait until the end of 2020 to find out what’s in store for us all.</p>
