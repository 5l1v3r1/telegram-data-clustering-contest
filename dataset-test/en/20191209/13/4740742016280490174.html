      <p>Ska band Madness has revealed they will perform near Bristol in the summer - and tickets go on sale this week.</p>
      <p>The British group, famous for hits Baggy Trousers and Our House, is set to play at Westonbirt Arboretum, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, on June 13.</p>
      <p>The gig will be one of two Madness appearances as part of the Forest Live summer concert series organised by Forestry England.</p>
      <p>Madness said: “Madheads come down to the woods, you’ll be in for a big surprise!”</p>
      <p>During the 1980s, Madness often dominated the pop charts thanks to songs including House of Fun and Our House.</p>
      <p>In 2019, the band celebrated its 40th anniversary and sold out dates in their home city of London.</p>
      <p>The Forest Live series, held every year by Forestry England, are intended to introduce new audiences to natural woodland areas around England, while income from ticket sales is used to help wildlife and trees flourish.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the Tetbury gig - which will also feature The Farm and Emily Capell - go on sale on Friday at 9am. The venue is under 30 miles from Bristol.</p>
