          </p>
          <p>Monday’s second encounter of the T10 league leads us to two units who ensured results on the opposing ends of the docket in the league openers. Where Falcons Hunters are stepping out looking to register their second win in a row, for Swift Gladiators, this is a match where the side will be scouring for a win which eluded them in their previous encounter.</p>
          <p>Registering only 93 runs against Desert Gladiators in their last tie, Swift Gladiators came up with an equally abject bowling effort, the ramifications of which were adverse for the side. They were defeated by 7 wickets, a match in which they were never able to establish themselves on the field, a performance they know they’ll need to overhaul if they are to have any chances of winning today.</p>

                <p>It’s down to the emphatic win Falcon Hunters registered the last time around, a match where they ended up piling on the biggest score by any side across the opening three matches played in the league. In what was a profound batting display by the side, one which was a testament to the staunch stature oft their batting unit, the side stamped their authority as they eased their way to a 9 wicket win in their pursuit of 104.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>There is a slight hint of green on the wicket, something which offers adequate purchase to the quicks but nothing that will extremely deter the bats either once they have got their eye in the middle. The opening couple of overs will be tricky for the bats but the runs will start flowing ensuing that with the team winning the toss preferring to come out and chase today.</p>

                            <h3>FAL Vs SWI Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 229 runs in 12 matches, Mohammed Rizlan comes into our side from Falcon Hunters. He’s someone capable of coming out and opening his arms with ease to amass a bagful of runs, some we envisage garnering a slew of runs against a paper thin bowling setup.</p>
                            <h3>FAL Vs SWI Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>He’s scored 867 runs in 44 T20 matches, a number which emotes his ability to leave opposition bowlers disparaged. It sees us rope in Babar Hayat from Falcon Hunters for this fixture along with Hashim Amla and Kamran khan as he opt for a trio of picks from the side in this ambit while from the opposition we have decided to find representation in the form of Zaheer Ibrahim for this encounter.</p>
                            <p>Although his side were extremely despondent with the bat the last time around, Ibrahim is up against a bowling unit which was flayed and frayed the last time around, a unit we envision Ibrahim ripping into today and getting crucial runs for his side.</p>
                            <h3>FAL Vs SWI Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>The 266 runs he’s managed to muster up in the 10 T20s he’s played in till date always meant that Ravinderpal Singh was going to be imbedded in our Dream 11 unit for the day but what further pushed us his way was the performance he meted out the last time around. It was a solid dsplays with the bat by him in an otherwise lacklustre batting performance, one which sees us make Swift Gladiators’ all-rounder, Ravinderpal Singh our first selection for the side.</p>
                            <p>Tamoor Sajjad Zafar elsewhere becomes our first pick from Flacon Hunters with the player having garnered 301 run in 11 T20 matches with Khalid Bhasheer giving him apt assistance for the day.</p>
                            <h3>FAL Vs SWI Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>His side’s leading wicket taker in the foregone contest, if Swift Gladiators are to have any chance of winning today, they’ll be requiring Inam-Ul Haq to induct in place yet another ominous performance. He came up with the two wickets the last time around and up against a riveting batting attack, his side are going to massively rely on his dependable skill set.</p>
                            <p>Sufiyan Mehmood comes in as well from the side while from the other side of the docket, the resplendent and electric Saad Zafar will be closing out our selections for this encounter.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Tamoor is handed over duties of our side’s captain with Ravinderpal Singh being made our vice-captain.</p>
