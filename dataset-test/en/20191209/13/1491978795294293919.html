      <p><b>Name:</b> Mattress theft.</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> Young. This is recent.</p>
      <p><b>Really? </b><b>Haven’t bur</b><b>glars always looked under the mattress when on a job</b><b>? Loads of people treat under the mattress like a savings account. </b>This isn’t about stealing what’s <i>under</i> the mattress, it’s about taking the actual mattress.</p>
      <p><b>Sounds awkward! </b><b>Where are these mattresses being stolen from?</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/hotels">Hotels</a>.</p>
      <p><b>It was Lenny Henry! I saw him in one of those beds from the purple hotel, on the beach, also at King’s Cross station.</b> That was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_EWgCF5G48">advert, for Premier Inn</a>. This is real. And the hotels are a lot posher.</p>
      <p><b>Posher than a Premier Inn? Shut up!</b> Seriously, we’re talking five stars here.</p>
      <p><b>OK, I have a confession to make: </b><b>there has been the odd occas</b><b>ion whe</b><b>n </b><b>we have stayed at </b><b>hotels </b><b>and </b><b>nicked the shower gel.</b> Of course, you have to! Along with all the toiletries.</p>
      <p><b>Also the sewing kit</b><b> and the sponge thing for shining shoes, and the slippers.</b> Naturally.</p>
      <p><b>We have thought about </b><b>tak</b><b>ing the bathrobes, too, but bottled it.</b> Yeah, they are on to that. They now try to guilt you into buying them.</p>
      <p><b>Obviously, we weren’t going to do that. So we took a couple of the smaller towels instead … and the iron</b>. Really?!</p>
      <p><b>Mattresses, though</b><b>! That seems like a step too far. </b>Agreed, but a survey of hoteliers has discovered that theft of luxury mattresses is becoming what is known in the hotel business as “a thing”.</p>
      <p><b>Especially for </b><b>five-star hotels?</b> Correct. They are eight times more likely to be robbed of a mattress than four-star hotels. Mattress technology has become so advanced that luxury hotels now pride and promote themselves on their mattresses, which can be worth several thousand pounds, making them a top target.</p>
      <p><b>Yeah, but …</b> You’re going to ask how you sneak it past reception, right?</p>
      <p><b>Exactly! </b><b>How does it work? </b><b>You get someone to distract them by ask</b><b>ing if they have got a city map, </b><b>while you just sneak </b><b>past and pray there isn’t a revolving door?</b> No. <a href="https://www.wellness-heaven.de/wellness/study-theft-in-hotels/">The survey, by Wellness Hotels</a>, finds that most mattresses go missing during the night from hotels with direct elevator access to their underground car park.</p>
      <p><b>Gotcha. A quick check of the corridor, into the lift, hit CP, into the van and away. Sweet dreams!</b> For ever, and thank you for the memory foam.</p>
      <p><b>Do say: “</b>Minibar? Yes, just the one Heineken, and a packet of nuts.”</p>
      <p><b>Don’t say:</b> “Oh, plus a handmade luxury pocket-sprung super king size, upholstered using layered cashmere, mohair and alpaca …”</p>
