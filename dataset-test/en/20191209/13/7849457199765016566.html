      <p>Vice presidential spokesperson Barry Gutierrez said Robredo will publicly release her report on the anti-drug campaign that includes her recommendations to improve the government’s efforts.</p>
      <p>“Hindi naman niya style iyong manira (It is not her style to discredit anyone),” Gutierrez, who is also a legal adviser to Robredo, said. “Hindi nga pumapatol iyan kapag siya iyong sinisiraan (She even doesn’t respond to those who discredit her).”</p>
      <p>The former lawmaker gave the assurance during Robredo’s weekly radio show, “BISErbisyong Leni,” aired over local radio station dzXL.</p>
      <p>Robredo deferred the release of her report from her short stint last month as co-chair of the Inter-agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD) at the conclusion of the country’s hosting of SEA Games which ends on December 11.</p>
      <p>She wants to make public her findings and recommendations since President Rodrigo Duterte has yet to read the previous two reports she sent to Malacañang while she was the drug czar.</p>
      <p>“We will make it public because it’s a waste if it just remains unread on his desk,” Robredo earlier said in Filipino.</p>
      <p>According to Robredo, she would also release a third report about the drug war after the SEA Games.</p>
      <p>On her radio show, Robredo’s spokesperson emphasized she would reveal “important information,” including her recommendations on “what she thinks needs to be improved” to contribute to the government’s anti-drug campaign.</p>
      <p>”Kasi nagkakasundo naman tayong lahat na ito ay isang importanteng isyu na dapat nating pagtulungan, Gutierrez said.</p>
      <p>(Since we all agree the illegal drug problem is an important issue that we should work on together.)</p>
      <p>Duterte fired the lady official from the ICAD post, which she held for 19 days, for allegedly failing to perform her duties at the anti-drug body.</p>
      <p>Malacañang said Robredo has committed “missteps,” such as her attempts to consult foreign individuals or organizations that have prejudged the drug war, her insistence to obtain classified information, and her tendency to share information to others.</p>
