      <h1>The Witcher: Meet Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer in New Featurettes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:12:53+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author">Narayan Liu</a></address>
      <p>With all the buzz surrounding Netflix's upcoming fantasy series, <a href="http://www.cbr.com/tag/the-witcher">The Witcher</a>, audiences might be growing increasingly curious about the characters standing front and center in the show's marketing material. Who is Geralt of Rivia? Ciri? Yennefer of Vengerberg?</p>
      <p>Those who have read Andrzej Sapkowski's novels or played the video games will of course know these characters well. For those who aren't as familiar, Netflix has released three new featurettes, each one introducing one of the three central protagonists. Each clip shows off the essentials of Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri, while the actors provide a brief outline of the roles they play.</p>

      <p>The featurettes offer a few new glimpses at the first season, but does not give anything away. That being said, Geralt's featurette does provide a great look at Jaskier the bard as well as his dynamic with the White Wolf, which might excite longtime fans of the novels.</p>
      <p>Where Sapkowski's novels predominately unfold across several years, Netflix's <i>The Witcher</i>, according to showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich, will evidently take place across an even longer period of time in order to fully explore the backstories of Geralt, Ciri and Yen, a lot of which the novels only really hint at.</p>
      <p><i>The Witcher</i> stars Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, Anya Chalotra as Yennefer of Vengerberg, Freya Allan as Ciri and Joey Batey as Jaskier. The series will be available to stream on Netflix starting December 20.</p>
