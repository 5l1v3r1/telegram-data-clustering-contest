      <h1>Falls and Poor Bone Health Top Reasons for High Fracture Risk in Parkinson’s, Study Says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T13:00:17+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Marta Figueiredo</a></address>
      <p>People with <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/">Parkinson’s disease</a> are at elevated risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures mostly because of the balance problems inherent to the disease and poorer bone health, a review study reports.</p>
      <p>These findings support making fracture risk assessment part of standard care for Parkinson’s patients.</p>
      <p>The study, “<u><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8756328219304673">The risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures in patients with Parkinson’s disease and parkinsonism: A systematic review and meta-analysis</a></u>,” was published in the journal <i><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/bone">Bone</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Several studies have shown that people with Parkinson’s are at a higher risk of falls and <a href="https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>, and have lower <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/bonedensity.html">bone mineral density (BMD)</a> than others their age without this disease.</p>
      <p>These factors are thought to contribute to the previously reported increased risk of fractures — with hip fractures being the most common — in these patients compared with the general population: A risk of falling is three times higher in Parkinson’s patients compared to age- and gender-matched healthy individuals.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553896">previous study</a> using Medicare data showed that a hip fracture also more than doubled the risk of death in Parkinson’s patients (and particularly in men), compared again to people without the disease. The occurrence of non-vertebral fractures — those that do not occur in the spine or skull — is also thought relevant by researchers and doctors.</p>
      <p>While vertebral fractures can also be quite disabling, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/spine-fracture">large proportion</a> of asymptomatic fractures, as well as their challenging identification (requiring serial radiographs), puts them among the least well-reported.</p>
      <p>“Despite the numerous individual studies published on the risk of fractures, the relationship between PD [Parkinson’s disease] and the risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures has not been systematically assessed,” the team wrote.</p>
      <p>Researchers at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a>, in the U.K., along with American colleagues systematically reviewed published studies on the occurrence of hip and non-vertebral fractures in Parkinson’s patients and people without the disease.</p>
      <p>From a total of 261 studies initially considered, 18 met the intended criteria and were included in the review, covering a total of 2.33 million participants. The selected studies also involved people diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/expert-answers/parkinsonism/faq-20058490">parkinsonism</a> — a general term for neurological disorders that cause movement problems similar to those of Parkinson’s.</p>
      <p>Seventeen of these studies were included in the hip fracture analysis, while nine studies were included in the non-vertebral fracture analysis.</p>
      <p>Results showed that people with Parkinson’s had a more than two-fold increased risk of hip fractures and a nearly two-fold increased risk of non-vertebral fractures than did the other group.</p>
      <p>Researchers noted significant differences between studies in the hip fracture analysis, which could affect their results. Further evaluation suggested that gender and location were responsible for 74.1% of this variation.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, they emphasized that their results were consistent with those reported in previous, smaller studies.</p>
      <p>Subgroup analysis of potential factors fracture risk influencing showed that the relative risk of hip fractures was higher in men than in women with Parkinson’s disease.</p>
      <p>The team hypothesized that this difference may be partly due to a lower rate of fractures in men than in women without Parkinson’s, since hip fractures in the general population are more common in women.</p>
      <p>“[W]e recommend a re-evaluation of the clinical guidelines on bone health in patients with PD to address this,” the researchers wrote.</p>
      <p>“Fracture risk assessment and evidence-based treatment for osteoporosis should be part of the care in patients with PD,” they added.</p>
      <p>The team noted, however, that these findings may not be applicable to Parkinson’s patients worldwide, since their work was based only on English-written studies in mostly Caucasian patients, and there was a significant heterogeneity between the studies.</p>
      <p>Researchers suggested that future studies could also assess the effect of BMD, falls, Parkinson’s medication, as well as anti-osteoporotic treatment on the occurrence of fractures in Parkinson’s patients.</p>
      <p>A U.S.-based Phase 4 clinical trial (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03924414">NCT03924414</a>), <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03924414#contactlocation">set to recruit</a> up to 3,500 patients 65 years or older, will assess one-time use of an approved treatment for osteoporosis against a placebo in lowering the fracture risk of Parkinson’s. After an intravenous infusion, participants will be followed for at least two years.</p>
