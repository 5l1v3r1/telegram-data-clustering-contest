      <p>TAMPA, Fla. – A new era kicks off for USF Bulls football.</p>
      <p>South Florida named former Clemson co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott as the new head football coach.</p>
      <p>Scott had been on the Clemson Tigers staff since 2008 and was a finalist for the Broyles Award, which honors the top assistant coach in the country, in 2018.</p>
      <p>USF is looking to rebuild after a disappointing 2019 campaign. The Bulls finished the season with a 4-8 record and fired head coach Charlie Strong earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Scott had been a member of Clemson’s coaching staff that led the Tigers to five consecutive College Footbal Playoffs as well as two national titles.</p>
      <p>He'll look to rejuvenate a USF offense that managed just 20.8 points per game last season, not even in the top 100 for qualifying schools.</p>
      <p>The most notable player to come through Jeff Scott's Clemson offense is current Houston Texans QB Deshaun Watson.</p>
