      <p>As a result of breaching FFP regulations, Milan find themselves in a situation where they may have to make player sales at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>Should the club part ways with key men, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stefano-pioli/"><b>Stefano Pioli</b></a> will want replacements to be signed, and it appears that the Italian giants are ready to bring in at least one fresh face.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Sport</i>, talks have already been held regarding a deal involving Todibo, who has struggled for game time at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Despite spending almost a year with the Catalan giants, the 19-year-old has made just three starts and one substitute outing in La Liga.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Barcelona are prepared to accept a bid of €10m (£8.42m), providing that a buy-back clause is included in any proposal.</p>
