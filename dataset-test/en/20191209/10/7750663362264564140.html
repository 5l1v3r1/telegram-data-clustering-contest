      <h1>Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale rules out Premier League return?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gareth-bale/"><b>Gareth Bale</b></a> allegedly has no intention of returning to the Premier League in the foreseeable future.</h2>

      <p>With Bale's future being a constant topic for debate over the past 12 months, the Wales international has naturally been linked with another spell in England's top flight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> - one of Bale's former clubs - have been linked with an approach for the 30-year-old during the January window.</p>
      <p>However, reports in Spain indicate that the attacker is not interested in returning to a league which involves frequent pressure from the media, instead preferring to move to a division which comes under less scrutiny.</p>
      <p>While Real are said to be happy to part ways with Bale, it has been claimed that Los Blancos want to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/madrid-to-offer-bale-rodriguez-for-pogba_382192.html">include him in a part-exchange deal</a> for United midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paul-pogba/"><b>Paul Pogba</b></a> as they bid to avoid shelling out a large fee for the World Cup winner.</p>
      <p>Bale still has over two-and-a-half years left on his contract at the Bernabeu.</p>
