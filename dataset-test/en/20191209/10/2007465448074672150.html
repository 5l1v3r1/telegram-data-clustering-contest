      <h2>Who says you can't dress up the Ford Ranger in carbon fiber?</h2>

      <p>Ever since the T6 Ford Ranger made its debut back in 2011, owners have been busy tricking it out, as well as dressing it up with countless modifications. From making them into 4x4 rigs, to classy road-going machines, it goes to show how customizable the Blue Oval's pick-up truck is.</p>
      <p>But what if you preferred to completely deck out your own Ford Ranger with a plethora of carbon fiber trim? Then why not take a look at what Motion R has available for the T6 Ranger. Based in the United Kingdom, Motion R decided to extensively use carbon fiber reinforced plastic to decorate the pick-up truck.</p>

      <p>From the front bumper, front wings, rear quarter panels, as well as the rear bumper; Motion R decked out the Ranger with the lightweight composite. This gives the pick-up truck a cool and an unmistakable look. Further complementing the Ranger's sleek carbon fiber appearance are the LED daytime running lights on the bumper, the huge carbon fiber hood, 'Motion R' carbon fiber front grill, and the 20-inch 'OR21' concave alloy wheels.</p>
      <p>Aside from the carbon fiber upgrade, Motion R also installed several aerodynamic upgrades. These include a front splitter, a rear bumper upgrade with an integrated diffuser, and a tailgate spoiler for good measure.</p>

      <p>Interior photos were not provided by Motion R. However, they did mention that also put carbon fiber dashboard trim that is available in either 2x2 weave or forged carbon. There's even a flat-bottomed steering wheel with perforated leather. Finally, an optional full nappa leather interior can be specified for the Ford Ranger.</p>

      <p>Want to have your Ford Ranger fitted with plenty of carbon fiber goodies? You better cough up GBP 39,995 or about Php 2.670 million to have it done, and that doesn't come with the full nappa leather upholstery. Expensive, yes. But is it worth it? Chime in your comments below.</p>
