      <p>Horrified onlookers were pushed back by huge crowds of people as a savage punch-up erupted last night at Winter Wonderland in London’s Hyde Park.</p>
      <p>Screams could be heard in the background as the two men rapidly traded blows, with one getting his opponent in a headlock.</p>
      <p>But others appeared to revel in the violence, as a video shared on social media shows a man jumping up and down with excitement.</p>
      <p>Someone shouts as someone else shouts ‘Don’t punch the head’ as people circle around the pair to watch the fight.</p>
      <p>Footage then shows security guards in high-vis vests forming a human chain in an attempt to break up the brawl.</p>

      <p>The Metropolitan Police say three people were arrested for public order offences at the popular Christmas attraction yesterday but it is not known if they involved in the fight.</p>
      <p>People on social media condemned the ‘thuggish-low life behaviour’ and said the venue had become ‘unsafe for children’.</p>
      <p>It is thought the brawl broke out as people queued to get into the main beer hall of Winter Wonderland’s Bavarian Village.</p>
      <p>An onlooker said massive crowd had gathered outside as the hall had been shut for an hour and was just re-opening.</p>
      <p>They <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7770623/Horrifying-moment-vicious-BRAWL-breaks-Winter-Wonderland-event-shocked-families.html">told MailOnline:</a> ‘Security were saying it would take two hours to get in and people started getting agitated and pushing to get to the top.</p>

      <p>‘Then two men started fighting and throwing punches and everyone was getting pushed back but there was nowhere to go.</p>
      <p>‘Security had to move back a barrier to stop people getting trampled, it was quite scary and it’s really lucky nobody was hurt.’</p>
      <p>The witness said they saw security guards forming a human chain to stop people rushing into the beet hall amidst the chaos.</p>
      <p>They said they saw one of the men bleeding from the fight and the other being arrested later on.</p>
      <p>Despite efforts to split everyone up, the witness said violence erupted again as people began flooding into the beer hall.</p>
      <p>The onlooker said a cover version singer was pulled off stage and replaced by Bavarian band playing ‘sedate folk music’ in an attempt to keep people calm.</p>
      <p>‘At least a dozen’ people were reportedly thrown out by security and bar staff decided to stop selling alcohol.</p>
      <p>A Hyde Park Winter Wonderland spokesperson said: ‘We can confirm Police and security staff ejected a number of people following incidents at Hyde Park Winter Wonderland last night. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.’</p>
