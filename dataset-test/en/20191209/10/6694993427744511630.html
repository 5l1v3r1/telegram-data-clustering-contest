      <h2>Man Utd midfielder Paul Pogba should soon return from injury and Antonio Valencia has spoken about what the club need to do to keep him happy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:36:41+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Duncker, https://www.facebook.com/CharlotteDunckerMEN/</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United captain Antonio Valencia believes <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/paul-pogba">Paul Pogba</a> needs love in order to shine at the club.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has not played for the club since the draw against Arsenal in September due to an ankle injury and there was speculation the France international was delaying his return ahead of a possible January transfer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> shut down those reports and Valencia has explained what he thinks United need to do to get the best out of the 26-year-old on his playing return in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>"Pogba is a star, I've known him since he was 14-years-old. Do you know what you need? Love," he told <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/premier-league/20191207/472078161228/antonio-valencia-pogba-derbi-manchester-united-city-mourinho-solskjaer.html">Mundo Deportivo.</a> "I have heard many rumors about Zidane and Real Madrid but he never said anything. He is reserved and an intelligent guy. If in United they give him that love, Pogba will shine as before."</p>
      <p>United put in their best two performances of the season this week with wins against Tottenham and Manchester City and Valencia believes the club need to be patient with Solskjaer and more positive results will come.</p>
      <p>"This season you have to make up the team, play well and understand each other," Valencia said. "And next year, it is important to enter the Champions League. Patience, the results will come."</p>
      <p>Despite the form of Scott McTominay and Fred, Solskjaer intends to accommodate World Cup Pogba winner in any side he picks. "Of course, Paul's going to play when he gets his fitness," Solskjaer said. "He's one of the best players in the world when he's in form.</p>
      <p>"We just need to give him time to be 100 per cent fit. It might be 45 minutes, the first game. It might be half-an-hour, it might be 90. It depends on what game he comes back in and I'm looking to get Paul back to where I had him a year ago."</p>
