      <p>The President of Ireland's award ceremony took place in Dublin Castle.</p>
      <p>The awards were presented by President Michael D Higgins in a prestigious ceremony hosted by Sinead Burke.</p>
      <p>Serena O’Dwyer received her bronze and silver award as a pupil of Cashel Community School and started her Gaisce journey to the gold award in sixth year under the guidance of her President Award Leader Irene Codd.</p>
      <p>The Gold Award requires participants to undertake five challenges.</p>
      <p>Serena volunteered in Uganda for the residential element.</p>
      <p>For her adventure journey she undertook a four-day walk along the Wild Atlantic Way, she volunteered as a mentor in a Big Brother Big Sister program where she assisted a young lady from a disadvantaged background.</p>
      <p>To keep fit for her physical section Serena chose dancing and finally for her personal skill she took singing lessons.</p>
      <p>Cashel Community School would like to congratulate Serena on this fantastic achievement. Her tenacity to complete all the requirements of the award is to be commended.</p>
      <p>The Gaisce Gold Award challenge is not an easy one – it demands motivation, determination and focus over a minimum of 52 weeks but in most cases takes a number of years to complete.</p>
      <p>This achievement not only demonstrates a personal determination, but also a commitment to the service of her community.</p>
