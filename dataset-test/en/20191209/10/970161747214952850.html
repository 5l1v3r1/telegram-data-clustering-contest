      <h1>Chrissy Teigen answers all our questions on celebs and their lavish lifestyles</h1>

        <b>Chrissy Teigen gave us a glimpse into the elite lives of A-list celebrities by revealing their secret perks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lip Sync Battle star took to Twitter to complete a Q&amp;A on everything normal people wanted to know about ‘being a super huge A list celebrity’.</p>
      <p>Retweeting a fans question asking whether rich people have a ‘junk drawer where they throw random cords and pens’, the 34-year-old responded: ‘it’s celebrity question asking time! Ask me, your favorite A list celebrity anything you would like to know about being a super huge A list celebrity’.</p>
      <p>Chrissy – who is married to John Legend – must have regretted giving fans the opportunity because thousands of questions came flooding in immediately.</p>
      <p>One fan asked: ‘Do you pay restaurants $ to let you cut the line? Or do they just do it automatically?’ to which Chrissy replied: ‘I make reservations and don’t give them the option to say no. “Hi it’s Chrissy Teigen and id like to make a reservation for 2 for John legend, do you have any availability?” if you just say “hi can I make a reservation for 2?” they say no. gotta say it all at once’.</p>
      <p>Pro-tip, if you want to make a reservation, just pretend you’re a celebrity and hope the waiters never figure out you’re lying.</p>

      <p>The next fan asked: ‘How the frick do most celebrities travel on planes? Are you ever just hustling through the airport trying to make it to your gate on time?’</p>
      <p>A fair question, indeed, because we’ve all wondered how celebs travel without getting bombarded by fans in gross airport toilets.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two answered: ‘There is a terminal a mile from the airport that you pay membership for. they do the same security privately and take you to the plane in a car. I know. I know.’</p>
      <p>How much is this membership, Chrissy? We need to know.</p>
      <p>If anyone thinks celebrities get to roam around their 20-bedroom mansions with no disturbance, think again.</p>

      <p>One fan asked whether assistants live with Chrissy and she answered: ‘We have a house manager who works at the house all day to handle our lives and day to day business, packages, scheduling for household staff etc’.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but their assistants do their grocery shopping as well, so Chrissy and her husband probably never have to worry about running out of milk.</p>
      <p>Plus, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/02/chrissy-teigen-claps-back-troll-tries-shame-nannies-personal-chef-11255921/">a personal chef helps them with most of the cooking</a>.</p>
      <p>As for bills and spending is handled by their very own business accountant.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the rest of us barter whether a night out is worth eating instant ramen for the rest of the month.</p>
