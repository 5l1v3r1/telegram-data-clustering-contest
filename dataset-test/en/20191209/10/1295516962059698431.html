      <h1>Crisis: Watch Every DC Cameo from Part 1 of the Arrowverse Crossover</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:12:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Johnson</a></address>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" viewers anxious to see the various cameo appearances from DC characters didn't have to wait very long once the event began.</p>
      <p>Part one of the Arrowverse crossover aired on Sunday's episode of <i>Supergirl</i>, and the introduction wasted little time delivering the promised appearances. After a short recap featuring the Arrowverse's known characters, the cameos began rolling. The first to appear is Robert Wuhl reprising his role as newspaper reporter Alexander Knox from the 1989 <i>Batman</i> film. The world is appropriately designated as Earth-89.</p>

      <p>Next up is Curran Walters and Alan Ritchson as Jason Todd/Robin and Hank Hall/Hawk, respectively, from Earth-9 -- home of DC Universe's <i>Titans</i> streaming series. Russell Tovey, as The Ray from Earth-X, follows. The character appeared as a member of the Freedom Fighters on last season's "Crisis on Earth-X" event.</p>
      <p>One of the most anticipated appearances wraps up the intro, showing Burt Ward as a civilian Dick Grayson, albeit in a Robin-colored sweater, exclaiming "Holy crimson skies of death!" as crimson skies do indeed descend on, what else, Earth-66 -- home of the 1966Â <i>Batman</i> TV series.</p>

      <p>The anti-matter wave that inevitably comes in the wake of the sinister looking skies appears to claim Earth-9 and Earth-X specifically, so further appearances from those characters are unlikely.</p>
      <p>"Crisis on Infinite Earths" continues in <i>Batwoman</i> on Monday, Dec. 9, and then picks up in <i>The Flash</i> on Tuesday, Dec. 10. After a winter hiatus, the crossover concludes on Tuesday, Jan. 14 on both <i>Arrow</i> and <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i>.</p>
