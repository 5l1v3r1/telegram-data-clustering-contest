      <h1>Woman set on fire in Bihar after failed rape bid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:57:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>A young woman was allegedly set on fire by a neighbour after she resisted his attempt to rape her, a police officer said here on Monday.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old victim, who suffered 50 per cent burns in the incident, was currently undergoing treatment at a hospital in the Muzaffarpur town, he said.</p>
      <p>Based on a complaint filed by her mother with Ahiyapur police station, the accused has been arrested, Station House Officer (SHO) Vikas Rai said.</p>
      <p>According to the complaint, the woman was alone at home on Saturday, when the accused, who lived close by, sneaked into her house and tried to rape her.</p>
      <p>Her mother -- who works at a primary health centre -- rushed home and took her to a hospital after a local informed her about the incident, the SHO added.</p>
      <p>Saturday's incident comes less than a week after charred bodies of two women, set afire after suspected rape and murder, were found in Buxar and Samastipur districts.</p>
      <p>In another village in Ahiyapur police station area, the body of an eight-year-old girl was found on Friday - stuffed in a bag and dumped in an orchard after suspected sexual assault.</p>
