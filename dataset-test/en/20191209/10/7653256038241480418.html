      <p>NEW DELHI: Home Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Amit-Shah">Amit Shah</a> on Monday moved further amendments to the Arms (Amendment) Bill including provision of special status to sportspersons.</p>
      <p>"There were many discrepancies in the six-decade old law making crime control difficult," he said while introducing further amendments in Lok Sabha.</p>
      <p>The further amendment to the Bill seeks to provide special status for sportspersons.</p>
      <p>"Many suggestions were received. I have moved an official amendment in this regard also," he said.</p>
      <p>The Bill was tabled in Lok Sabha on November 29. The Bill seeks to enhance punishment for illegally possessing and making prohibited arms besides other changes in the six- decade-old Arms Act.</p>
      <p>The Arms (Amendment) Bill makes provision that a person can have a maximum of two firearms, as against the present norm of three.</p>
      <p>Those who own more than two firearms will have to deposit the third one with authorities or authorised gun dealers within 90 days for de-licensing once the amendment is approved by Parliament, according to the bill.</p>
      <p>As per the bill, the government proposes to amend Section 25 (1AA) of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Arms-Act,-1959">Arms Act, 1959</a>, to give punishment from the usual life term of 14 years to "imprisonment for the remainder of that person's life" for manufacturing, selling, repairing and possessing "prohibited" arms.</p>
      <p>The minimum punishment under this section will be 14 years.</p>
      <p>Under the present law, the offence invites imprisonment not be less than seven years but may extend to life imprisonment - mostly up to 14 years.</p>
      <p>According to an estimate, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India">India</a> has around 35 lakh gun licences. Thirteen lakh people have licences to carry weapons in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Uttar-Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, followed by <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jammu-and-Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, where 3.7 lakh people possess arms licences, most of which were taken in the name of personal security.</p>
      <p>Punjab, which witnessed <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/terrorism">terrorism</a> in 1980s and 1990s, has around 3.6 lakh active gun licences, most of which were issued during the two decades wherein militancy had engulfed the state.</p>
