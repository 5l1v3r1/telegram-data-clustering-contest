      <p>The finalists for this year's I'm a Celebrity were barely out of the jungle before rumours started about their successors in 2020.</p>
      <p>And it was a big name who joked that he would be willing to appear in 12 months' time.</p>
      <p>Robbie Williams teased that he hopes to bag a record appearance fee of millions to sign up for next year.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show on ITV, Robbie chatted to jungle hosts <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec</a> via video link.</p>
      <p>The one-time X Factor judge asked: "What about the next series? Any guests lined up?"</p>
      <p>He jokingly added: "So a really famous singer will get paid millions for going on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celeb</a> right?"</p>
      <p>He added: "Those bugs are so disgusting but I am going to eat them anyway to make really good prime time television."</p>
      <p>Pushing to be invited, he added: "Boys what do you say?</p>
      <p>"How am I looking for the next series?"</p>
      <p>Robbie is used to slimming down and explained all about his recent weight loss - and how he has keeps the pounds off.</p>
      <p>"When I smoke, I'm half smoke, half man," he said. "I'm a man of extremes. And the wife said, you got to give up smoking. January the 1st. And in May, that sounded like a good deal.</p>
      <p>"And also, I didn't want to do the death, the early death. So I was like, yeah, OK. Then it got to November. And I was like, remember January the 1st?</p>
      <p>â€œAnd I just thought, hang on, maybe I can just view this differently.</p>
      <p>"This whole process, not only could I give up smoking, but I could be fit and healthy and have a clean head and a clean vision of how I want my future. And I found that moment to be very, very powerful."</p>
