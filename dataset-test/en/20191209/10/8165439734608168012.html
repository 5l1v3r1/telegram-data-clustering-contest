      <h3>Myles Stephenson speaks out</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/imacelebrity/"><i>I'm A Celeb's</i></a> Myles Stephenson opens up about what was said between himself and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacjossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> in the jungle.</p>
      <p>It's after reports emerged that he told her that he believes her husband Dan Osborne had an affair with his ex <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gabbydawnallen/">Gabby Allen</a>.</p>

      <p>The Sun reports that soon after, Dan allegedly told his friends that he wants to, 'knock [Myles'] head off.'</p>
      <p>Myles' response to this is, 'I’ve grown up with much scarier people than Dan.'</p>

      <p>The<i> Rak-Su</i> member opens up to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10499820/myles-stephenson-punch-up-dan-osborne/">The Sun</a> following his <i>I'm A Celeb</i> eviction.</p>
      <p>When told about Dan's alleged threats, Myles says, 'It’s an immature response.'</p>
      <p>'If you know you’ve done no wrong, why would you want to knock someone’s head off?'</p>

      <p>Myles continues, 'He shouldn’t get his back up. It makes him look bitter and stupid.'</p>
      <p>'If he wants to come and try and knock my head off it won’t end well.'</p>
      <p>'One of us is going to end up in the nick and nobody needs that.'</p>

      <p>When this interview took place last week, Myles was staying in the same hotel as Dan in Australia.</p>
      <p>At this point, they hadn't come face to face.</p>
      <p>He tells the outlet, 'He’s got two kids here. He should be looking after them.'</p>

      <h3>Myles thinks Dan should come forward</h3>
      <p>The singer believes Dan should knock on his door and talk to him.</p>
      <p>'He’s here. He knew I was coming out of the jungle and he could’ve knocked on my door.'</p>
      <p>'I’d have let him in. I’ve grown up with much scarier people than Dan.'</p>
      <p>'I’m not scared of a thing.'</p>

      <p>He goes on, 'You can make threats, it means nothing. This isn’t a game. I’m sitting here with my family now.'</p>
      <p>'If you’re walking around all heated, in the foyer, we’re going to cross paths.'</p>
      <h3>What was said</h3>
      <p>Myles reveals what he said to Jacqueline in the jungle.</p>
      <p>'There was a moment in camp when Jac asked about the situation.'</p>
      <p>'I said to her, ‘Look, we’re not going to talk about it now. We’re in front of about 150 cameras right now’.'</p>

      <p>He explains that she quizzed him even further when they were on their way to a Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>'I spoke to her about it. I told her what I thought about the situation.'</p>
      <p>And he admits, 'I told her what I’ve seen.'</p>

      <p>He goes on, 'I told her, 'I’m only telling you because you’re already a sister to me.' If it was the other way, I’d want to know.'</p>
      <p>'I also went on to tell her that, at the end of the day, I’m not a spiteful person.'</p>

      <h3>Myles takes a step back</h3>
      <p>It sounds like the<i> Rak-Su</i> member has decided to take a step back.</p>
      <p>'I spoke to Jac about it and said, ‘Whatever you decide to take from what I’ve told is down to you and Dan.''</p>

      <p>'I’ve got nothing against him. I said to her that if he tried something with me, it could go sour.'</p>
      <p>'I’m not going to stand there and take punches, I’m going to fight back, but if he wants to talk, we can talk.'</p>

      <p>Thankfully, it looks like Myles and Dan have gotten past their differences.</p>
      <p>A source tells <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/article-7768755/Dan-Osborne-proves-forgiven-Jacqueline-Jossas-Im-Celeb-star-Myles-Stephenson.html">MailOnline</a> that they met and have, 'cleared the air of any misunderstandings that have been reported.'</p>
      <p>In pictures obtained by the outlet, the pair were pictured laughing poolside in Australia.</p>

      <p>These allegations are the least of Dan's worries.</p>
      <p>He's fighting off claims he had a threesome with Natalie Nunn and Chloe Ayling last year.</p>
