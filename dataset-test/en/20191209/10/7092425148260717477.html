      <p>Thanks to a record number of billion dollar blockbusters, Disney has become the first studio in history to surpass $10 billion at the worldwide box office.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/disney-box-office-record-10-billion-frozen-2-lion-king-avengers-endgame-1203428859/"><i>Variety</i></a> are reporting that Disney is imminently set to become the first studio to move beyond the $10 billion mark.</p>
      <p>As of Sunday, the current total is at around $9.997 billion, made up $3.28 billion in North America and $6.7 billion in the rest of the world.</p>

      <p>This year's <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/casting-director-reveals-two-avengers-came-close-landing-different-superhero-roles-mcu-343429"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> ($2.798 billion global takings) and The Lion King live action remake ($1.656 billion) contributed a huge chunk to the milestone, which will be made official before Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens in the next fortnight.</p>
      <p>Variety notes that recent Fox films - with that empire acquired by Disney in March - such as Dark Phoenix and Le Mans '66 don't count towards the overall total, otherwise they'd be up at around $11.9 billion.</p>
      <p>2019 has been a colossal year for the studio, with five films crossing the billion dollar mark at the box office, Avengers: Endgame, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/watch-new-lion-king-trailer-reveals-beyonce-nalas-voice-328312"><i>The Lion King</i></a>, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and Captain Marvel.</p>
