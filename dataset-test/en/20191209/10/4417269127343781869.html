      <p>SAPS’s top management seeks to remind the public that while the festive season exudes joy and excitement, this period also breeds sophisticated criminals armed with the latest scams and technology to extort hard-earned money.<br/>Mindful of this, the police compiled safety tips to ensure that citizens are ahead of criminals.</p>
      <p>These safety tips are aimed at contributing to the safety and security of people during the holiday season.<br/>Shopping:<br/>· Shop during daylight hours if it is possible. If you must shop at night, ensure that a friend or family member accompanies you.<br/>· Avoid wearing expensive jewellery.<br/>· Do not carry a purse or wallet in your hand, if possible.<br/>· Always carry your driver’s licence or identification card along with the necessary cash, cheques or a credit card at all times.<br/>· Even though you are in a rush and thinking about a thousand things, be aware of your surroundings.<br/>· Avoid carrying large amounts of cash.<br/>· Pay for purchases with a cheque or credit card, if it is possible.<br/>· Keep cash in your front pocket.<br/>· Notify the credit card issuer immediately if your credit card is lost, stolen or misused.<br/>· Keep a record of all of your credit card numbers in a safe place at home.<br/>· Be extra careful if you carry a wallet or purse. They are the prime targets of criminals in crowded shopping areas, transportation terminals, bus stops, on buses and other rapid transit.<br/>· Avoid overloading yourself with packages. It is important to have clear visibility and freedom of motion to avoid mishaps.<br/>· Beware of strangers approaching you for any reason. At this time of year, con artists may try various methods of distracting you with the intention of taking your money or belongings.</p>
      <blockquote>“Remember, as you have been industrious during the year and have worked hard for your money, you must ensure that during this year’s holiday season, you do not easily give way to criminals by not adhering to, and becoming careless and vulnerable to holiday crime. Despite the tips we have provided above, we can never be too careful or too prepared, but by observing these tips, we may avoid becoming victims. Have a happy holiday season,” said Captain Charlene Van der Spuy.</blockquote>
