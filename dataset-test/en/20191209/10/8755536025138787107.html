      <p>Fans have reacted to Philip Schofield’s most recent tweet, as the presenter shared a video of himself and Holly Willoughby amid rumours of a day time TV “civil war.”</p>
      <p>According to claims, a number of ITV staff have complained about Philip within the organisation.</p>
      <p>Phillip has ignored rumours of potential feuds in order to share the video, which shares the news that he and Holly are up for a Telly Talks award.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10510400/phillip-schofield-ignores-this-morning-feud-twitter/">The Sun</a> claims that This Morning’s Friday presenter Ruth Langsford has made an official complaint against Philip.</p>
      <p>They also allege that Holly’s relationship with Philip has become strained in recent months.</p>
      <p>Reports claim that Holly felt embarrassed by Philip’s social media behaviors.</p>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10499882/phillip-schofield-holly-ruth-this-morning-war/">The Sun</a> said: “Holly felt it was inappropriate that Phillip was posting videos of her on social media drinking shots of alcohol, but felt too nervous to speak to him directly about it.”</p>
      <p>‘So someone at their agents YMU spoke to Phillip who accepted Holly’s decision. But it just shows things can become strained between them. But they find a way to work it out.’</p>
      <p>Philip has apparently ignored the rift rumours in sharing the tweet, and fans are not happy.</p>

      <p>“Not even an explanation or an apology for his biased unprofessional behavior. He needs sacking,” said one follower.</p>
      <p>“Any response to the outcry? Are you not ashamed?,” said another.</p>
      <p>However, some shared their support for the presenter.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote: “People dont know him. Who knows what the truth is. I think people need to concentrate on their own life before talking about someone else when they have no idea what the truth is. Leave the poor bloke alone.”</p>
