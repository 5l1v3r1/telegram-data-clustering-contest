      <p>Writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge has revealed that a film she is collaborating on with her sister is the most exciting thing she has ever done.</p>
      <p>The Fleabag creator revealed that her sister Isobel, a musician who wrote the score for the hit TV show, has a role in the secretive new project.</p>
      <p>“I am totally obsessed,” Waller Bridge said. “I have never been so excited about writing anything.”</p>

      <p>Her comments came at an event at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall on Sunday night to discuss her new book based on the hit TV show – Fleabag: The Scriptures.</p>
      <p>It would not be Waller-Bridge’s first film credit. She was brought in to help polish off the script for the forthcoming Bond movie.</p>
      <p>She also revealed a desire to write another play.</p>
      <p>Fleabag was originally staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013 before being adapted for a BBC series three years later.</p>

      <p>The second series introduced a character widely referred to as the “hot priest” by fans, who becomes a love interest for Fleabag – the show’s unnamed protagonist.</p>
      <p>But Ms Waller-Bridge said she did not invent the term to refer to the character played by Andrew Scott.</p>
      <p>“He is very much just ‘priest’ in the script – Twitter created ‘hot priest’, I believe,” she said.</p>
      <p>But Waller-Bridge, who also stars as Fleabag, said she was nervous about writing the character.</p>

      <p>“I was worried about writing a priest, especially a comedy priest,” she said, revealing that she was afraid of falling into some traps.</p>
      <p>Published last month, Fleabag: The Scriptures contains the show’s script and new writing from Waller-Bridge.</p>
      <p>The show started life as a 10-minute monologue at the Leicester Square Theatre in London, but was made into a full Edinburgh show after Waller-Bridge was accosted by a member of the audience afterwards.</p>
      <p>The writer revealed that an “absolutely hammered” woman came up to her to demand she turn the short piece into a full-length play.</p>
      <p>“That was so f****** good, you’ve got to take it to Edinburgh,” the woman said, according to Waller Bridge. “I was like ‘yeah, yeah’,” she said. “The next day Francesca (Moody, Fleabag’s producer) contacted the Underbelly.”</p>
