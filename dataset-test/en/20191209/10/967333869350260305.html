      <blockquote>"According to the latest information, a Greek court overturned the decision to extradite Vinnik to the US and France. A decision on the Russian Federation is yet to be made. At the moment, we are helping Alexander via humanitarian channels", Moskalkova said.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the ombudswoman, she maintains contacts with her Greek counterpart, Andreas Pottakis, and Vinnik's lawyer to monitor the issues related to the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907271076375611-us-demands-russias-vinnik-pay-100mln-in-fines-for-alleged-money-laundering/">Russian national's detention</a> and condition.</p>
      <blockquote>"When Vinnik stopped his hunger strike, it was necessary to take a number of medical measures to bring him out of this state, and our contacts with the Greek ombudsman played a positive role there", Moskalkova added.</blockquote>
