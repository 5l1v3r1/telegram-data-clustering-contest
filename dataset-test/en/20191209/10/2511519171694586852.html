      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Liverpool">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> insists he has never doubted the quality of £52.7million midfielder <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/naby-keita">Naby Keita</a>.</p>
      <p>Keita, who arrived at Anfield to much fanfare in the summer of 2018, has been reduced to a peripheral figure and played a limited role in last season’s Champions League success and the club’s current 33-game <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>The Guinea international gave a reminder of his ability with a goal and an assist on his first top-flight start of the campaign in Saturday’s 3-0 win at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Reds boss Klopp, who has reassured the 24-year-old about his lack of first-team opportunities, admits the relentless form of his league leaders and a series of tight matches have made it difficult to give him minutes.</p>
      <p>“Naby had injuries, the team is in really good shape, so then do you change?,” said Klopp.</p>
      <p>“We are not flying, it’s not like we won all of the games 4-0, or 5-0, so we had to bring on a player who helps us with defending set-pieces.</p>
      <p>“Then Naby is sitting outside thinking, ‘why don’t I play?’ I get all that.</p>
      <p>“So we stayed in contact, we talked and we spoke a lot about it.</p>
      <p>“But in the end of course a player needs to have this evidence that the manager still believes in you. I was never in doubt about that.</p>
      <p>“It was just unlucky and in life you need luck always. He started (his Liverpool career) really well – everybody forgot that – then got injured. And again we had two really good seasons.</p>
      <p>“(I was) never in doubt about his quality.”</p>
      <p>Former RB Leipzig player Keita doubled Liverpool’s advantage at the Vitality Stadium and then slipped in Mohamed Salah for the third after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring.</p>
      <p>Liverpool last lost a league game back in early January but, despite building a sizeable points advantage over Leicester and Manchester City at the top of the table, Klopp is not getting carried away.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if it’s so special because we don’t think about it,” he said of the unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>“We get confronted with our winning streak always after the game, that’s the only moment. From that moment on, nobody thinks about it.</p>
      <p>“It’s not that I have to keep myself together because I’m flying and want to constantly smile and run around.</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty concerned about always the next game and that means we have to make sure that we’re always in the best possible shape.</p>
      <p>“And the boys are in the same mood. The boys so far were 100 per cent serious and will stay (like that) and see where it leads us.”</p>
      <p>The comfortable nature of the south coast success meant Klopp was afforded the luxury of giving breathers to unused substitutes Divock Origi – who scored twice in Wednesday’s Merseyside derby win over Everton – and Sadio Mane ahead of Tuesday’s crunch European clash with RB Salzburg.</p>
      <p>Klopp also gave midfielders Adam Lallana and Georgino Wijnaldum the weekend off because of minor injury concerns.</p>
      <p>He believes resting and rotating his players will be key to successfully negotiating a hectic December schedule and competing in five different competitions.</p>
      <p>“It was wonderful – maybe the best thing of the (Bournemouth) game – we didn’t have to use Sadio Mane,” said the German, whose team must avoid defeat in Austria to reach the Champions League knockout stages.</p>
      <p>“He was the all-time (ever-present) player in the last couple of weeks, so he could stay outside, Divock outside.</p>
      <p>“The people were shouting for Divock Origi, I get that, I loved the performance of Divock Origi (against Everton) but bringing him on to say thank you or whatever, we have so many games.</p>
      <p>“We will see how we start on Tuesday. I have no clue about that now.</p>
      <p>“But (on Saturday) we could give at least one or two – plus Gini (Wijnaldum), plus Adam – kind of a rest, and hopefully they are all fit again on Tuesday and then we make a new decision.”</p>
