      <h1>I'm A Celebrity: Roman Kemp breaks down watching message from Mum and Dad</h1>
      <h2>It was shown on Extra Camp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:38:23+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>An emotional Roman Kemp welled up during <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>'s final Extra Camp of the 2019 series as his parents Martin Kemp and Shirlie Holliman paid a loving tribute to their darling son.</p>
      <p>Singing star Martin, 58, hailed Roman’s efforts on the ITV jungle reality show as ‘the best television experience’ of his life in a touching moment that left third-placed Roman smiling but overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>The Capital Radio DJ put his fist in front of his mouth as he became choked up during his folks' brief address in a short video on the ITV2 spin-off show, with runner up Andy Whyment immediately giving him a hug as Roman took it all in.</p>
      <p>"Listen, Ro - we are so proud of you. You have made us laugh, cry. You've just been incredible," his mum began, as both she and Martin beamed with pride.</p>

      <p>Spandau Ballet star Martin continued: "You’ve given us such anxiety, too - I can’t tell you. It has been the best television experience of my life."</p>
      <p>"We love you so much, Ro. And we can’t wait to see you," added Shirlie.</p>
      <aside>Love you, big boy.</aside>
      <p>And as they signed off and Martin raised a hand to salute his son, he added: "Love you, big boy."</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Martin had championed his son’s drive for votes to win on Instagram and Twitter throughout Sunday by sharing two heartwarming videos showing Roman as a young boy.</p>

      <p>And after Roman's bronze medal position was confirmed, he made it clear how made up he was for his lad, also thanking fans for their dedicated support.</p>
      <p>Talking to Ant and Dec following his departure from the camp, Roman said his stint in the jungle Down Under had been the most moving time he has ever known.</p>

      <p>He said: "I’ve never had more fun, I’ve never had so much emotion in my life.</p>
      <p>"And it’s a really strange place down there, it’s a really unnatural thing that forms a family within three weeks."</p>
      <p>His last day in camp saw him take on his personal biggest fear - which, along with a water-based trial, he had been dreading his entire stay on the show - as he endured the Panic Pit Bushtucker trial.</p>

      <p>Buried in an underground chamber, Roman shared the confined space with nearly 60 snakes for ten minutes to win stars for three puddings and a drink as Queen of the Jungle Jac Jossa, Andy and he enjoyed a final slap up meal.</p>
      <p>"That was absolutely terrifying," he admitted.</p>
