      <p>"Sourdough baking can be challenging, to say the least," writes Sarah Jampel at <i><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fresh-sourdough-starter">Bon Appetit</a></i>. This starter-in-a-jar takes the stress out of creating a fermented dough, and because it descends from a strain that's over 100 years old, "you know it's going to be bubbly, active, and reliable." <b><a href="https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/classic-fresh-sourdough-starter-1-oz">Buy it at King Arthur Flour.</a></b></p>

      <p>Tapered, French-style rolling pins offer far better control than pins with handles, and they're also easier to clean. This 23-inch maple pin is "ideal for rolling rounds of crust for pie," writes Hannah Kirshner at <i><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-rolling-pin/">The Wirecutter</a></i>, and it's "sturdy enough to last a lifetime." <b><a href="https://www.whetstonewoodenware.com/store/p31/french_rolling_pins.html">Buy it at Whetstone Woodenware.</a></b></p>
