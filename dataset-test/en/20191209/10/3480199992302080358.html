      <p>If the Conservatives win Great Grimsby this week, it will bring to an end a period of Labour representation in the constituency that has lasted without a break for 74 years.</p>
      <p>It will also symbolise how successful the Tories have been at this election in overturning generations of political tradition in Labour’s heartlands.</p>
      <p>Only four MPs have represented Great Grimsby since the end of the Second World War, all of them Labour – Kenneth Younger, Tony Crosland, Austin Mitchell and Melanie Onn.</p>
      <p>It has been a marginal seat ahead of various elections, including 1964, 1987 and 2015, but on each occasion Labour held on.</p>
      <p>Now that might be about to change.</p>

      <p>The Conservatives need a swing of 3.7% on December 12 to overturn Ms Onn’s majority of 2,565.</p>
      <p>Polls suggest the party might be on course to take the seat with candidate Lia Nici, and by a comfortable margin.</p>
      <p>It is an outcome that could be repeated in other constituencies across northern England with decades of Labour history.</p>
      <p>Examples include Bishop Auckland (Labour since 1935), Wakefield (1932), Don Valley (1922) and Rother Valley (1918).</p>
      <p>All of these seats could turn blue on December 12 if the Conservatives perform strongly.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson visited Great Grimsby on Monday while on the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>If his party wins the seat this week, it will vindicate the Tories’ strategy of targeting Leave-backing Labour voters in parts of the country that have not seen Conservative MPs for generations.</p>
      <p>Six candidates are standing in Great Grimsby: Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Green, the Brexit Party and an Independent.</p>
