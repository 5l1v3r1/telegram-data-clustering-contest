      <h3>Brief: Who is Zozibini Tunzi</h3>
      <p>The brief biography of the 26-year-old winner who is from Tsolo read: “Zozibini Tunzi is a passionate activist and engaged in the fight against gender based violence.</p>
      <p>“She has devoted her social media campaign to changing the narrative around gender stereotypes. She is a proud advocate for natural beauty and encourages women to love themselves the way they are.”</p>
      <p>Ms Tunzi had been a strong voice in campaigning against gender-based violence, GBV, in South Africa. She had at a point urged South African men to write what she described as love letters to the country’s women.</p>
      <p>The country has some of the highest rates of GBV figures across Africa. In her response to what young girls needed most in growing up, she cited leadership.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that has been lacking in young girls and women for a very long time not because we don’t want to but because of what society has labelled women to be. I think we are the most powerful beings in the world,” she said.</p>
