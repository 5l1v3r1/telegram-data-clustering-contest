      <p>There's still no <i>Persona 5</i> on the Switch, and God only knows when Atlus are porting <i>Persona 5</i> or <i>Persona 5 Royal</i> to PC, but at least Joker and co are making an appearance in another Japanese RPG.</p>
      <p>That game is <i>Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space</i>, the mobile RPG created by Masato Kato, the writer behind the majority of <i>Chrono Trigger</i>. We've checked out <i>Another Eden</i> <a href="http://reddit.com/r/games/">when it launched</a> at the beginning of the year. It's purely a solo RPG, so despite the small element of gacha that's inevitable in mobile JRPGs, Ethan found there wasn't a fight he couldn't beat for free and the game was genuinely story-driven.</p>

      <p>Now, that mobile JRPG is getting its own piece of <i>Persona 5</i>. The Phantom Thieves and Joker will be added to the game as part of a simultaneous worldwide update for <i>Another Eden</i>. It's called <i>Bound Wills and the Hollow Puppeteer</i>, and players will be able to enjoy the chapter's prologue after finishing the second chapter of <i>Another Eden</i>'s main story, with the rest of the story accessible after finishing <i>Another Eden</i>'s 13th chapter.</p>

      <p>There's a lot of similar beats between <i>Another Eden</i> and <i>Chrono Trigger</i>, with characters asking getting philosophical about shaping the future and travelling 800 years into the future after a boss fight. Each character has their own class and special abilities, with new fighters accessible through Chronos Stones, a currency you earn from in-game challenges or just straight out paying real-world money for. You'll get enough Stones in the first hour to buy your first character.</p>
      <p>If you want to get a sense of what you're in for, here's a chunk of gameplay from the beginning on Android. <i>Another Eden</i> is available on Android, iOS and iPad now, with the free <i>Personal 5: Royal</i> crossover being patched into the game from December 11 for all users.</p>
