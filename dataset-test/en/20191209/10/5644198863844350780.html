      <p>WELLINGTON: About 100 people were near New Zealand's White Island volcano when it erupted suddenly on Monday (Dec 9), leaving authorities scrambling to treat the injured and find those unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the volcanic island - also known as Whakaari - off New Zealand's north coast had erupted while groups of tourists were visiting.</p>

      <p>"It is very much an evolving situation and of course all our thoughts are with those affected," she told reporters in Wellington, adding that an undetermined number of people were unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the eruption began about 2.30pm local time (9.30am Singapore time), throwing smoke and debris into the air.</p>
      <p>The island is about 50km from North Island in the picturesque Bay of Plenty, and is popular with adventurous tourists willing to don hard hats and gas masks.</p>

      <p>The White Island volcano is one of New Zealand's most active volcanoes.</p>
      <p>According to the national Met Service, the eruption was visible on satellite images. </p>

      <p>Whakatane mayor Judy Turner said "there have been people injured" and rescue missions were under way.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how many or the state of their injuries but emergency services are currently frantically trying to get these people back from the island to hospital for treatment," she said.</p>
      <p>She added that there seems to be no danger for the people in the coastal areas, farther from the volcano.</p>
      <p>St John Ambulance said there were up to 20 people believed injured but medical teams were still en route.</p>

      <p>There were particular fears for a group of visitors seen walking on the crater floor moments before the eruption occurred.</p>
      <p>Cameras providing a live feed from the volcano showed more than half a dozen people walking inside the rim at 2.10pm local time (9.10am Singapore time), before images went dark when the eruption occurred minutes later.</p>
      <p>Police said they were responding to the incident, but offered no further comment.</p>
      <p>A report by the NZ Herald said many of those visiting White Island on Monday were from the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.</p>
      <p>Port of Tauranga company chief executive Mark Cairns was quoted as saying that he understood the majority of those injured in the eruption are from the ship. </p>
      <p>New Zealand's national emergency crisis centre has been activated.</p>

      <p>The volcanic eruption made the area immediately around the island hazardous, the National Emergency Management Agency said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The agency described the eruption as "moderate", although a thick plume of white ash could be seen for miles around.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Several helicopters and aircraft could be seen in the area.</b>

        <b>White Island is New Zealand's most active volcano cone and about 70 per cent of it is undersea, according to government agency GeoNet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Around 10,000 people visit the volcano every year. It has erupted frequently over the last half-century, most recently in 2016.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In August of that year the New Zealand Defence Force airlifted a 2.4-tonne shipping container onto the island to serve as an emergency shelter in case of an eruption.</b>
