        <b>Harry Maguire has the top four in his crosshairs after Manchester United's thrilling derby triumph at Manchester City lifted them to fifth in the Premier League table.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A week that started with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer under pressure after a below-par performance in a home draw against promoted Aston Villa ended with a second memorable victory in a matter of days.</p>
      <p>Fresh from deservedly seeing off Jose Mourinho's Tottenham 2-1 on Wednesday, United won by the same scoreline at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday thanks to a breathtaking start and impressive gameplan.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's side could have added to goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in a fine first half that laid the foundation for the 2-1 victory, which moved them to within five points of fourth-placed Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"I think you need to look after your own results, don't look elsewhere, keep winning games," said Maguire, the world's most expensive defender.</p>
      <p>"We've won back-to-back games against Spurs and City. We've got another big game next week now (at home to Everton).</p>
      <p>"The top four is in sight but we just keep looking after our own results, keep trying to get the three points and keep improving."</p>
      <p>United struggled to score goals in the early months of the season but Rashford, Martial and the fleet-footed Daniel James showed they can scare any side on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Over the last month or so, I feel like as a defender I look at the forwards and think they're going to score goals," Maguire told MUTV.</p>
      <p>"At the start of the season we didn't really score more than one goal in a game but now I think it's a few games on the spin where we're back to scoring goals.</p>
      <p>"They're a big threat, they're top players, great talent and I think it's all coming together now."</p>
      <p>United are unbeaten in five Premier League matches and have secured their first back-to-back league wins since March.</p>
      <p>There is a growing confidence within Solskjaer's squad and Maguire is targeting more improvements after captaining the side to victory in the blue half of Manchester.</p>
      <p>"We feel like this year we haven't got results in some games where we feel we deserved the three points," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think the last two games, I don't think anyone can question that we've deserved both victories."</p>
