      <p>Kartik Aaryan is soaring high as his latest release <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i> is successfully entertaining the audience in theatres. The film is based on the lines of cheating and from what Kartik Aaryan has revealed in his latest interview, we think he doesn’t mind cheating on a person in real life as well.</p>
      <p>Well, Kartik Aaryan made some shocking statements when asked about relationships that may leave you speechless as well. According to the <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i> star, it isn’t cheating if one finds some other girl cute while being in a relationship. He revealed that he has been attracted to someone else while he was dating a girl and he does not consider it to be cheating on her.</p>

      <p>While interacting with Times Now, he said, “I have been in a relationship and I have got attracted to someone else? Yes, I have! Emotional cheating should never be the case. Physical cheating too shouldn’t be the case. But emotional is worse. So in attraction, it isn’t cheating because you feel she’s cute then it’s okay. It’s better if it doesn’t go beyond that.”</p>
      <p>Well, this is not the first time we have seen Kartik make such shocking revelations about his personal life. Earlier he had said, “Acting and sex are like bread and butter. You can’t quit either. Acting and sex or love go hand in hand for me. I don’t like talking about my personal life but I don’t like hiding it also.”</p>
      <p>On the work front, Kartik Aaryan will be next seen in <i>Bhool Bhulaiyya 2</i>. The film also stars Kiara Advani and Tabu in pivotal roles. Kartik has also been roped in for <i>Dostana 2</i>. The film stars Janhvi Kapoor and Lakshya.</p>
