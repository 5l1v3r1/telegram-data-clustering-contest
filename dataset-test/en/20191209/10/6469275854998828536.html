      <p>Gust of 60-70mph are expected along coastal areas and higher ground.</p>
      <p>Residents are being warned to expect travel disruption to road, rail, air and ferry transport, along with the possibility of power cuts across the region.</p>
      <p>A Met Office spokesman said: "Very strong south to southwesterly winds are expected to develop across parts of Wales, England and Scotland during Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Winds will strengthen through the morning with gusts of 50-60 mph likely inland, and 60-70 mph around some coasts and over higher ground.</p>
      <p>"The strongest winds will probably occur ahead of an intense band of rain that is expected to move quickly eastwards during the day, winds easing once this clears."</p>
      <p>
        <b>This is what to expect:</b>
      </p>
      <p>• Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely</p>
      <p>• Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer, made worse by spray and surface water</p>
      <p>• Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely</p>
      <p>• Some short term loss of power and other services is possible</p>
