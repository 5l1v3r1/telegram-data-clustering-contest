      <p>At a press conference at about 6 p.m. local time, the New Zealand police <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SkyNewsAustralia/videos/2212987702333492/?hc_ref=ARTf6GJ3neMQfWVW8uVF68IBMQVDcMHZrdsu6998ESf6KHQjX5K3wl2wYSIZSuBmVm4&amp;fref=nf&amp;__xts__[0]=68.ARA8hL1CioffQ1oVRIZ-jBCTEw_7wOKGpqgjYhIqMNMQ8RsD0rYSDPu_Q3kpJxw90idt9yi6TRINAWIKHTgebBdiT6xgqhFMuvFBmHehHrOaerLIwMMcmW1kdXkdfVNqGUR1t-MmSdqGnN7M8S5FanJn0K1pXzBD3-J6HjGmLhCLBa5PDdUfXsAo2I1HeqoWB0zd6-C36gV3-TpMuVoYPEEJwbq8sCTNIW_AJ9Kg3kXXT-Vqo9Tkjq77g-4CBRNBpWdHskdWuRk5ZzCxTU2tSwiQYoilMv4G9OpxZcUDusGiuTnZmpUgyFjtOBIhgSLcT6F8f7HLkN38U3ivvNzAo19L5R4hzA&amp;__tn__=kC-R;__tn__=kC-R">confirmed</a> that at least five people had died as a result of the eruption, while others were being treated in nearby hospitals for burns.</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether the group of people inside the crater were among those killed or injured.</p>
      <p>The image shows a pathway leading to the rim of the crater. A group of people can be seen walking along the path.</p>
      <p>White smoke can also be seen rising from the rim of the crater.</p>
