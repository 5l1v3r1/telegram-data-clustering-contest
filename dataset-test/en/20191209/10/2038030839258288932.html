      <p>Cape Town - Kanye West debuted the new original <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/kanye-west-unveils-opera-to-premiere-this-month-20191119"><b>opera </b></a><i><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/kanye-west-unveils-opera-to-premiere-this-month-20191119"><b>Mary </b></a></i><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/kanye-west-unveils-opera-to-premiere-this-month-20191119"><b>at the Miami Marine Stadium</b></a> on Sunday, 8 December while covering his body in silver.</p>
      <p>The opera, directed by Vanessa Beecroft, follows on the heels of <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i> Kanye's first opera, which premiered last month at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>For the rapper, the opera is a new medium through which to express his commitment to faith and his ever-expanding musical and visual palette according to a statement released to the press.</p>
      <p><i>Mary</i> is an original opera, based on the biblical story of the miraculous events surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ. The Books of Matthew and Luke recount the story of <i>Mary</i>, who was divinely chosen by God to bring forth the Messiah. </p>
      <p><i>Mary</i> brings together elements from different worlds - including opera, fine art, modern dance, and gospel music - to create a new visual interpretation and innovative performance structure. The stage production is performed by the Sunday Service collective, a ministry formed in January of 2019, in collaboration with Access Opera.</p>
      <p>With the Sunday Service Collective working alongside a cast of professional opera singers, <i>Mary</i> represents an innovative interpretation of Kanye's own music, gospel standards, and traditional opera alike.</p>
