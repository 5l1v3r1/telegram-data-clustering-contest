      <p>The American Civil Liberties Union filed a challenge against <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1177276978602414080?s=20">the law in September</a>. They described the statute as a coercive tactic to get patients to avoid abortions.</p>
      <p>“Kentucky’s mandatory narrated ultrasound law forces doctors to display and describe a patient’s ultrasound images against the patient’s will — while they are lying on the exam table, half-naked, with a probe inside their vagina,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1177276980863078400?s=20">they</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1177276982851264512?s=20">wrote</a>. “The only reason to force doctors to display and describe an ultrasound before an abortion — against a patient’s will — is to shame and coerce someone who has decided to end a pregnancy. The Supreme Court should strike these laws down once and for all.”</p>
      <p>Four justices must sign off for the entire court to hear the case.</p>
      <p>The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/petition-writ-certiorari-supreme-court-united-states">had upheld the law</a>. The petitioners, including the EMW Women’s Surgical Center, challenged it on First Amendment grounds. From the ACLU’s <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/petition-writ-certiorari-supreme-court-united-states">petition for a writ of certiorari</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The question of First Amendment law presented here is also self-evidently important, as it implicates numerous compulsory display-and-describe ultrasound laws around the Nation, as well as state regulation of physician-patient speech more broadly. This petition offers the Court an ideal vehicle through which to resolve the question presented.</blockquote>
