      <p>After contributing 12 goals and numerous assists in 51 Premier League appearances for the Foxes, the 23-year-old has been linked with a future transfer to another top-flight club.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> are all said to hold an interest in the playmaker, who recently made his international debut with England.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>talkSPORT</i>, Maddison is ready to sign a new long-term contract with the East Midlands outfit in the near future.</p>
      <p>While Maddison still has over three-and-a-half years left on his existing deal, Leicester are seemingly ready to reward the former Norwich City man for his recent impressive form.</p>
