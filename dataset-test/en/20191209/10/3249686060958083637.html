      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/iu">IU</a> and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/sung-si-kyung">Sung Si Kyung</a> have come together to release a special holiday song!</p>
      <p>On December 9 KST, the two singers dropped the music video for the song "<b>First Winter</b>," a sentimental love song reflecting the emotions of a couple celebrating their first Christmas together. The music video follows a couple separately making their way through scenic parts of Seoul before meeting up in front of a large illuminated Christmas tree in the center of town to exchange wrapped gifts.</p>
      <p>The single is the second time the two artists have collaborated together, having previously released the duet "<b>It's You</b>" together back in 2010.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sung Si Kyung will be holding encore performances of his 2019 'Song' concert on December 20 and 21 at Jamsil Arena in Seoul.</p>
