      <h1>Luno Planning To Add Ripple To Its List By Early 2020</h1>

      <p>Luno, the cryptocurrency exchange, seems to be making waves of late. Less than a month after it officially announced its comeback in Malaysia and plans to expand its cryptocurrency list, the company recently announced that it was planning on making Ripple (XRP) one of the first alternative coins (altcoins) available on the exchange.</p>
      <p>According to an exclusive interview with The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), Ripple has already been approved by the Securities Commission (SC), and that Luno will be bringing the cryptocurrency onboard the exchange sometime during the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>According to Vijay Ayyar, Head of Luno in Asia, the digital currency is still not yet listed on Luno, but that is a possibility that the company is exploring. At this point, the companyâ€™s main priority was retaining customer safety and compliance with regulations. Ayyar also told TMR that the adoption of Ripple could roll the cryptocurrency market further along.</p>

      <p>XRP was created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based currency exchanged that was founded in 2012. After Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP has the third-largest market capitalisation of US$9.2 billion (~RM38.3 billion).</p>
