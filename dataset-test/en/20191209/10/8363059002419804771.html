      <h1>Peter Sarsgaard Has Been Cast in The Batman in an Unknown Role</h1>

      <p>Though fans have a guess… or two.</p>
      <p>Matt Reeves made Bat-waves yesterday when he posted a simple tweet. Only three words, and one gif. The words? “Oh… Hi, Peter…” Oh, and there was also a Bat emoji. That part is pretty important.</p>

      <p>That’s right, it appears Sarsgaard is next in line to join the <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/reports-andy-serkis-and-colin-farrell-could-be-batmans-1839645752">frankly</a> <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/john-turturro-joins-the-batman-as-mobster-carmine-falcone/">incredible cast</a> of <i>The Batman</i>, alongside Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, and <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/robert-pattinsons-batman-will-fight-paul-dano-riddler/">Paul Dano.</a> Only problem is, Reeves didn’t divulge what might be the most important detail: who he’s playing. Fans have a guess, though, based on rumours about the film and some hints posted online.</p>
      <p>One such hint might come from the Instagram of Sarsgaard’s wife, former Bat-star herself Maggie Gyllenhaal, who, concurrent with the announcement, posted an image of Sarsgaard mid-shave. Which is to say, solidly halfway through it.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Yep, that, along with the weird second face in the Sarsgaard gif chosen by Reeves, and just general rumours that the film might be taking inspiration from <i>The Long Halloween</i>, a lot of fans are assuming that Sarsgaard is going to be playing Harvey Dent, Two-Face himself. Is this true? I have no idea. But I think it would be neat!</p>
      <p>For more <i>The Batman </i>news, stay tuned to Gizmodo. The movie is scheduled to hit cinemas on 25th June 2021, with filming starting next month.</p>
