        <b>A seventh and final suspect was also arrested after a deadly attack on a passer-by in Augsburg on Friday evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Augsburg police headquarters said on Monday that all of the suspects have now been caught.</p>
      <p>A 49-year-old professional firefighter had been killed on Friday evening in an argument with a group of young men at Königsplatz in the centre of Augsburg in Bavaria.</p>
      <p>The man had been at the city’s Christmas market with his wife and a couple of friends, before dining in a nearby restaurant.</p>
      <p>There the two couples met a group of seven young men with whom they got into an argument. One of the men hit the victim in the head, causing him to fall to the ground.</p>
      <p>His 50-year-old companion was also beaten by the group and injured in the face. The two women were not attacked and remained unharmed.</p>

      <p>The perpetrators then fled. Emergency doctors tried to resuscitate the man on site, but the 49-year-old died in the ambulance.</p>
      <p>Investigators arrested the first two 17-year-old suspects on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The video surveillance, which the police installed at Augsburg's Königsplatz in December 2018, helped with the search.</p>
      <p>One 17-year-old suspect is a German who also has Turkish and Lebanese citizenship. The other 17-year-old is a native of Augsburg with Italian citizenship.</p>
      <p>Investigators will announce further details of the case at a press conference on Monday afternoon, they said.</p>
      <p>Over 100 firemen held a moment of silence for their colleague at the scene of the crime on Sunday, and also laid flowers and lit candles.</p>
      <p>Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder also gave his condolences: "We are all shaken. All our sympathies go to the fireman's family."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Surveillance ‘made the work of police much easier’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann (CSU) stressed the importance of video surveillance during arrests after the fatal attack.</p>
      <p>"The images made the work of the police much easier", the CSU politician told the Augsburger Allgemeine.</p>
      <p>The video surveillance at Königsplatz, the central point for public transport in the city, was not put in place until December 2018 as part of a state programme, the newspaper reported.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Since then, the police have been monitoring the area with 15 cameras.</p>
      <p>"We have always pushed this, and such cases show that the demand has proven to be right," Herrmann added.</p>
      <p>It difficult for eyewitnesses to describe the perpetrators of a crime precisely, which is why video recordings are the most important for the investigation, he said.</p>
      <p>However, Hermann said that video surveillance should be restricted. He said: "We don't want total surveillance, it only exists in authoritarian states.”</p>
      <p>Instead, he said, the focus should be on trying to prevent “excessive violence” in public spaces in the first place.</p>
