      <p>The Gauteng government has revealed a multibillion-rand strategy to restore the dignity of children and the poor in the province.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, acting MEC for Social Development and Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi announced Gauteng’s anti-poverty strategy to eliminate urban hunger and inequality.</p>
      <p>“The strategy will protect the poor, the weak and vulnerable by providing solid services that will move them from dependency to independence.</p>
      <p>“It will remove some beneficiaries from relying on social grants to work opportunities within government projects,” said Lesufi.</p>
      <p>The strategy would start immediately with protecting children, especially those in child-headed families. Lesufi said the strategy aimed to benefit about 160000 children with 20000 children targeted this festive season.</p>
