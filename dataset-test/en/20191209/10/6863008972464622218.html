      <p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says NATO does not consider Russia an "enemy".</p>
      <p>"We don't list foes. So we don't define Russia as an enemy. What we see is a more assertive Russia, which has used military force against neighbor Ukraine," Stoltenberg told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2019/12/06/exp-gps-1208-stoltenberg-on-nato-and-russia.cnn">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>At the same time, he emphasized that NATO would not turn a blind eye to Russian aggression and ensured that the Alliance would try to apply dialogue wherever it is possible.</p>
      <p>"We don't divide the world into either foes or friends," said the NATO secretary general, when pressed to define Russia.</p>
      <p>Stoltenberg added that in an "uncertain" moment like this, such a strong institute as NATO is required to ensure security of the West.</p>
