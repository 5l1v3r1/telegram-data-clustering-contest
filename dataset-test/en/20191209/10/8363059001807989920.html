      <h1>Netflix Has Scrapped Its Free 30-Day Trials Because You're a Cheap Arsehole</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:00:51+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Netflix is either making another seemingly anti-consumer move, or there's enough people playing silly buggers to warrant the decision.</p>
      <p>The streaming service offers a free 30-day trial to give you a little taste of the goods and - hopefully - get you hooked into dropping that sweet subscription fee every month. But it seems those golden days are over, as the option appears to have disappeared from the website.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/netflix-is-apparently-fed-up-of-freeloaders-drops-free-trials-in-uk-3962628?utm_source=keystone&amp;utm_medium=keystone_core_reviews_rss&amp;utm_campaign=trusted+reviews">Trusted Reviews</a> reports that the free trial is no longer available in the UK, and the only comment Netflix has made so far has been to <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2019/12/netflix-getting-rid-of-free-trials-for-uk-customers/">MoneySavingExpert</a>, saying that existing customers who have already started the trial won't be affected, but no one else is getting in.</p>
      <p>The Netflix spokesperson also said that the platform was "looking at different marketing promotions in the UK to attract new members and give them a great Netflix experience," but didn't elaborate on what that entails.</p>
      <p>Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has previously demonstrated a fairly laid back approach to people finding ways to avoid paying the sub fees but getting the content anyway - like password sharing, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/piracy-crackdown-may-be-next-front-streaming-wars-1252309">saying</a> it's "something you have to learn to live with."</p>
      <p>He apparently did a 180 with the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) - of which Netflix is a member - announcing that it would be working to tackle unauthorised access to content citing “improper password sharing” as an example.</p>
      <p>Maybe people were going a bit nuts with free trials on a plethora of email accounts to the point that it's become an issue. Or perhaps the streaming wars means finding more ways to wring cash out of everyone. We've contacted Netflix for comment.</p>
