      <h1>Thousands Protest In Russia's Northwest Against Becoming Moscow's Dumping Ground</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:42:12+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:42</time> by <a rel="author">RFE/RL's Russian Service</a></address>
      <p>KOTLAS, Russia -- Thousands have rallied in the northwestern Russian town of Kotlas against the construction of a new landfill for waste from Moscow.</p>
      <p>One of the organizers of the rally, Vyacheslav Grigoryants, told RFE/RL that at least 3,000 men and women demonstrated in the town of 60,000 on December 8.</p>
      <p>Other sources said more than 10,000 people attended the rally, where demonstrators demanded a halt to the ongoing construction of the dump in the town of Shiyes, near the regional capital, Arkhangelsk.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Arkhangelsk have said that some 10.5 million tons of garbage are to be transferred to the new landfill from Moscow in the next 20 years.</p>
      <p>The construction of the new landfill near Arkhangelsk started in July 2018. Protests against it began just a month later.</p>
      <p>Similar rallies have been held in recent months in other Russian cities and towns.</p>
      <p>In early February, nationwide rallies against landfills took place in 30 regions across Russia.</p>
