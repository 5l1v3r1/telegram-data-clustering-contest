      <p>Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision between a woman and a bus in Torquay which left the 26-year-old with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>It happened at around 9.30pm on Saturday, December 7. Emergency services were called to reports of a collision between a Stagecoach bus and a single female pedestrian.</p>
      <p>Police say the 26-year-old local woman suffered considerable lower leg injuries and was taken to Derriford Hospital for treatment.</p>

      <p>No other parties were injured in the collision.</p>
      <p>Eyewitness Pete Vernon, who called 999, said the whole thing happened in “two or three seconds”.</p>
      <p>He said: “The girl in question is about 21 years old. Was coming out of Revolution and as she did her friend said something and she turned. The bus was passing as she turned. She hit her head on the side of the bus and as she fell her legs went under the wheels. There was nothing the driver could have done. It wasn’t his or her fault because the front of the vehicle had long passed although the whole thing happened in two or three seconds.</p>
      <p>“I called 999 and had to give a statement. It was just a very unfortunate accident. My thoughts are with the girl’s family.”</p>
      <p>Another eyewitness who gave a police statement saw the crash happened. He said: “As she came out of Revolution she was looking the opposite way and the bus hit her face and then went over her legs.</p>
      <p>The road was closed for a short time whilst emergency services dealt with the injured party and the scene.</p>
