      <p>This caused the celebrities to take to social media to vent out their displeasure of waiting in vain for the American star. The likes  of Afia Schwarzenegger, Hajia4real amongst others took a swipe at Cardi B for keeping them waiting while eating Khebab.</p>
      <p>Cardi B finally came out to meet with the celebrities  and apologized for keeping them waiting explaining that she was not in the known that she had a meet and greet session.</p>
      <p>As predictable as Akuapem poloo is, she didn’t hold back in showing off her twerking skills to Cardi B who joined her in dancing.</p>
      <p>As the dancing was going on, Akuapem poloo’s wig came off and she quickly took it and run off causing a loud laughter among the audience present.</p>
      <p>Well the most important thing is, Akuapem poloo finally had the chance to meet her mentor.</p>
