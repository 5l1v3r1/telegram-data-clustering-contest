      <h3>President Rodrigo Duterte has enjoined all Sangguniang Barangays to establish a social assistance program for village officials and employees this Yuletide.</h3>
      <p>Under Executive Order 99 issued by Duterte on December 6, the 2019 Yuletide social assistance program will be created through an ordinance to be passed by the local legislative body.</p>
      <p>“The Yuletide season is an opportune time to establish such measures or programs for the economic empowerment of barangay officials and functionaries, in recognition of their valuable and meaningful service that effect genuine and positive change in their respective communities,” the EO stated.</p>
      <p>Duterte directed the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to jointly issue the appropriate guidelines such as the components of the program and the specific criteria and parameters for the determination of the qualified barangay officials and functionaries.</p>
      <p>The expenses for the program will be charged against the barangay’s available funds.</p>
      <p>For the succeeding years, the DILG, in consultation with the DBM, will have to study and propose measures for the provision of social assistance to qualified barangay officials and functionaries, as well as identify funding sources </p>
