      <p>Properly taxing earnings from crypto is a <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/portugal-exempts-taxation-on-crypto-trading-and-payments/">major debate topic</a> all over the world; however, the South Korean government has finally found a way.</p>
      <p>The South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to impose capital gains tax on digital currencies, <i>The Korea Times</i> reported on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Per the sources of the local publication, the ministry is aiming to prepare the first draft of the bill by the first half of next year.</p>
      <p>“Related discussions have been taking place […] The revised bill will be drawn up by the first half of next year,” an anonymous official from the ministry told the publication.</p>

      <h3>Taxation is mandatory</h3>
      <p>However, the report also outlined that the government will not rely on the approval of the upcoming bill – it is prepared to <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/is-anyone-actually-gonna-pay-taxes-on-crypto-this-year/">levy capital gains tax</a> on incomes from digital currencies anyway. The government, however, should put a clear definition of cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is also not clear whether the government is planning to implement the gains tax similar to profits from stock trading or real estate transactions.</p>
      <p>The South Korean government is already collecting trading data from the crypto exchanges operating in the country, which is essential to impose a tax on such incomes.</p>
      <p>Several other countries are also considering to impose similar taxation on crypto earnings. Last month, Ukraine proposed a similar bill for crypto gains tax. If passed, the nationals need to pay a five percent tax on crypto for the first five years, and afterward, the government will levy the standard 18 percent tax.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, several other <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/regulation/south-korea-passes-new-bill-to-pave-crypto-regulation-path/">crypto-related bills</a> are pending with the South Korean Assembly for approval. The government is also determined to strengthen know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules and proposed an act to mandate banks to issue only real-name accounts to crypto exchanges.</p>
