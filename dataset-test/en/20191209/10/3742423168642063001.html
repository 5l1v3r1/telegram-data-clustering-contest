      <p>Like most guys of a certain vintage, I have mixed feelings about my body. Staying lean and not surrendering to the siren’s call of the dreaded 'Dadbod' is a key concern. But then so is building and maintaining enough muscle so that I can keep up with the young bucks on the soccer field or in the gym.</p>
      <p>One of the main keys to success is your diet. You need a meal plan that's high in healthy carbs, fats and proteins. More importantly, it needs to be easy to prepare and affordable - so you'll actually stick to it.</p>
      <p>There's no shortage of tips that deal with <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/tags/exercise/">actual exercise</a> on Lifehacker - instead, this guide focuses on the fuel you should be preparing to build muscle and reduce body fat.</p>
      <p>Part anabolic diet, part ketogenic diet and part dopamine diet, this all-rounder is perfect for anyone looking to stay on the health train. It's a super-simple diet protocol that provides everything we need to train, grow, recover and sleep, with minimum disruption to our lives and, critically, not sacrificing taste or enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Consider it a dietary form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_physical_preparedness">GPP (General Physical Preparedness)</a>. With bodily GPP I want to be able to achieve a number of feats or accomplishments at any given time with no specific training.</p>
      <p>For nutritional general preparedness, we’re:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>eliminating most empty, white carbs from our diet</li>
        <li>ensuring we get enough protein to facilitate muscle growth</li>
        <li>using fat increasingly as an energy source</li>
        <li>using green vegetables to provide carbohydrates and essential nutrients</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Is it boring to eat this way? Or a chore? Not really. The healthy fats in this diet provide both satiety and sufficient hits of dopamine to keep cravings at bay. Permanently.</p>
      <p>Can you eat this way if you have kids? Yes, absolutely. A few variations for Junior and you’re there.</p>
      <h3>The Meal Plan</h3>
      <h4>#1 Pre-Breakfast: Protein Shake w Milk</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein 34g</li>
        <li>Carbs 17g</li>
        <li>Fat 10g</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most supplements are stuffed with all kinds of chemicals that you can't pronounce. It’s a multi-billion-dollar industry that promises silver-bullets yet delivers (mostly) damp squibs.</p>
      <p>However, as a guy in a hurry, I need fuel after workouts and to kick-start the day. Sleep is catabolic, meaning it depletes your muscles. That's not good, especially if you're on the lean side to begin with (what's known in the trade as a 'hard-gainer'.)</p>
      <p>A sound guiding principle is to start the day with 30g of protein if you're serious about building muscle.</p>
      <p>A brown-rice based, all-natural protein is probably a little less effective than some of the other stuff but it helps get me to my macros and I feel somewhat better about it, especially as I'm going to be drinking three of these a day.</p>
      <h4>#2 Breakfast: 3 Egg Omelette With Cheese</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein 21g</li>
        <li>Carbs 1g</li>
        <li>Fat 18g</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A more elaborate 'one-pan keto-feast’' could include sausages, green vegetables, smoked salmon but that will take more time than we have to play with. The omelette is super-speedy.</p>
      <p>Variations on this theme could be to include a bowl of porridge and stirring through some protein powder to make 'chocolate protein oats'. The only ingredients for this are milk, water, oats and your protein - in less than 7 minutes you’ll be fuelling up for the day ahead.</p>
      <h4>#3 Snack: Protein Shake</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein 34g</li>
        <li>Carbs 17g</li>
        <li>Fat 10g</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>#4 Lunch - Tuna, Brown Rice &amp; Beans + 2 Glasses Milk</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein 43g</li>
        <li>Carbs 74g</li>
        <li>Fat 26g</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In terms of bang-for-your-buck and downright convenience, you can't go past this combination - the Holy Trinity of lunchtime goodness.</p>
      <p>Try Sirena tuna, whose label reassures that it's line caught and sustainable etc. Basil oil flavour is especially tasty. Add a tin of Edgells 4 Bean Mix and 90 Second microwave brown rice.</p>
      <p>Throw grated cheese over the top of this for more fat, and because, well, cheese makes everything taste better.</p>
      <p>Total cost per meal: $5.35</p>
      <h4>#3 Snack: Protein Shake</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein 34g</li>
        <li>Carbs 17g</li>
        <li>Fat 10g</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>#6 Dinner: Chicken / Pork, Broccoli, Zucchini, Sweet Potato, Apple</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein 66g</li>
        <li>Carbs 54g</li>
        <li>Fat 16g</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You could roast / bake a tray of vegetables and chuck some chicken breast in the other side of the tray (covered in a little foil tent for half the cooking time (usually 30-35 mins) to stop it drying out.</p>
      <p>The beauty of this is that once you've tossed it in the oven, you can go and workout for a bit or play with junior.</p>
      <p>However, if you can get yourself a microwave steamer, your whole whole world will change.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2017/04/Steamer.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Here's how.</p>
      <p>Chop up your veg and layer it in the steamer according to how long it takes to cook. Then steam it for about 4 minutes. [Note: sweet potato can handle around 3 mins on its own before you add the greens for the remaining 4 mins. This depends on the power of your microwave so play around with it.]</p>
      <p>This could be the end of the story. You serve up your greens with your meat (which you've pan-fried and rested under foil and out of the pan for 5 minutes - this is crucial.)</p>
      <p>You'll probably want some seasoning with this though.</p>
      <p>Or take things to a completely different level with only a modicum of extra effort.</p>
      <p>Drain the veggies, blanche under cold water to stop the cooking process, throw a decent knob of butter into the meat pan and then mix the greens through the butter.</p>
      <p>In a restaurant this would be called something like 'twice-cooked greens, keto-style,' or something equally grand, and, as with a lot of the cooking here, it depends on your approach to fats and what your nutritional objectives are.</p>
      <p>Additional fats, especially those that have traditionally been considered unhealthy, is</p>
      <p>But, if you still want flavour and satiety, then it's worth trying because it makes them taste delicious.</p>
      <h3>Total: Protein 214g, Carbohydrate 180g, Fat: 90g</h3>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>This plan works for busy guys (and gals) for a few key reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It’s cheap</li>
        <li>It's healthy</li>
        <li>It's easy to stick to</li>
        <li>It tastes good</li>
        <li>It’s easy to hit (and stick to) your macros</li>
        <li>It eradicates most unhealthy carbs from your diet</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Is it perfect? Nope.</p>
      <p>Could it be made healthier? Yep, pretty easily. Sub in celery sticks dipped in almond butter for one of the snacks would be an easy tweak.</p>
      <p>But bang-for-your-buck simplicity, economy and taste it’s right on the money.</p>
