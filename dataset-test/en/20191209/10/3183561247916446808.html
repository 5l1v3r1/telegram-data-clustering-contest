      <p>It takes a special kind of audacity for your startup to be successful, and a special kind of audacity to name your startup “Unicorn”. Sadly, the overlapping of those two audacious circles did not spell success for one scooter company.</p>
      <p>Unicorn’s founder, Nick Evans, sent an email to customers saying that Unicorn “totally failed as a business,” and that they would not be delivering any scooters and could not refund any money. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/7/21000094/unicorn-electric-scooter-shut-down-refund-tile">The Verge</a>, the company spent all its money on advertising, marketing and other expenses. Once all of that was covered, none was left over for actually making and delivering the scooters.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, the cost of the ads were [sic] just too expensive to build a sustainable business,” Evans said in the email.</p>
      <p>Unicorn joined a very crowded market a bit too late and with too little funding to compete with scooter companies that have been <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/you-lost-how-much-on-scooters">burning through cash</a> in a losing business. Its scooters were to cost $US699 ($1,022) and had features like GPS tracking, similar to Tile, a company co-founded by Evans.</p>
      <p>I’ve never understood the strategy of “the startup”, even though I’ve spent most of my career in and around it. To me, it has often seemed like a non-strategy; a place where enthusiastic people throw billions of dollars of spaghetti at the wall. And sometimes billions of dollars of ads at Facebook.</p>
      <p>In any case, Unicorns don’t exist, anymore.</p>
