Developer Gary Brooks said the late-hour pour was scheduled to avoid traffic hassles and other inconveniences to downtown workers, visitors and residents as a result of the large line-up of trucks.

      <p>More than 1,500 cubic yards of concrete slurry, delivered by 150 trucks, was poured overnight Friday for the foundation of a new entrance and exit ramp tower that will provide access to structured parking as part of the redevelopment of First National Center.</p>
      <p>Demolition of the 1971 First National annex facing Broadway started in July 2018 and wrapped over the summer.</p>
      <p>Developer Gary Brooks said the late-hour pour was scheduled to avoid traffic hassles and other inconveniences to downtown workers, visitors and residents as a result of the large line-up of trucks.</p>
      <p>The new tower will connect to the 1957 annex facing Park Avenue that is being converted into parking. The first two floors will be rebuilt as a retail gallery.</p>
      <p>All of this work is part of a $250 million redevelopment of the original Art Deco First National tower built in 1931 which is being converted into housing, retail and a hotel. Brooks said the garage will be the first part of the project to open with a date set for early 2021.</p>
