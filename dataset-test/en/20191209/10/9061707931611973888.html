      <p>It has been the highlight of Derby’s Christmas celebrations for many years - the annual lights switch-on in the Market Place.</p>
      <p>A colourful parade headed by no other than Father Christmas winding its way through the city centre and the fun-filled musical extravaganza which culminated in the big moment when the Market Place and surrounding streets were flooded with a sparkling lights display.</p>
      <p>There have been many different versions of the event over the years but one thing has never changed, the excitement of the crowds who have packed into the square to witness the spectacle.</p>
      <p>These fabulous photos from our archive show some of the switch-on events in the Noughties and the celebrities who have done the honours, including everyone from entertainer Lionel Blair and Coronation Street and Benidorm actress Sherrie Hewson to X-Factor finalists and Britain’s Got Talent winner George Sampson.</p>
