      <p>Jack Dikian of Mosman writes: "For those younger readers who might be wondering if, when Santa sets off from the North Pole this Christmas Eve, flying carbon-neutral will be high on his wish list, the Regional Council of Lapland has 'made vital, environmental investments in the age-old practices of reindeer herding to help control the release of harmful greenhouse gases.' Just don’t ask how."</p>
      <p>
        <b>"I have just received a Christmas card from the local funeral director," says David Tarran of Thornleigh. "This is the first time I have received a card from them. Do they know something I don’t know?"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wrapping up the Chrimbo theme for the day, George Manojlovic of Mangerton notes that "a house up the road has one of those inflatable Santas scaling a wall. Trouble is, he's as limp as boiled spinach. Being on his own, I'd say his reindeer let him down."</p>

        <b>In the hope that our current dry spell isn’t the beginning of the end, Manbir Singh Kohli of Pemulwuy writes: “This question has been troubling my innards in this drought. Does toilet paper have a wider water impact compared to the lowly bidet? Perhaps the collective wisdom of C8 will help enlighten me.”</b>

      <p>"I apologise for my tardiness in submitting this comment, but I save up my Column 8s to read in one sitting, so some of them are a week or so old," explains Sue Davis of Wamberal. "I have a butcher bird (C8) in my garden who sometimes sings the first line of <i>Old MacDonald Had a Farm</i>. He doesn't do the 'e i e i o' though. Maybe that's just too difficult."</p>

        <b>"The smallest inhabited island in Moreton Bay is Karragarra Island where one of Australia's first driverless buses is being trialled," advises Gregory Abbott of Macleay Island (Qld). "First report is that the bus is so friendly it stopped for a leaf and for a butterfly." Must be the sensitive type.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now a question for those seeking change from Tim Royle of Chatswood: “I keep finding small collections of foreign coins in numerous offshore currencies as a result of both my business and personal travel. Instead of giving to an offshore organisation, I would prefer an Australian-approved charity. So I ask C8 to nominate a qualified Australian charity who will accept my load of assorted foreign coinage. My first choices would be the NSW drought or bushfire-affected areas.”</p>
