      <h1>Snapchat working on 'deepfake' feature which is not as sinister as it sounds</h1>

      <p>Snapchat is working on a ‘deepfake’ feature which will let users add their face to videos.</p>
      <p>The new tool is called Cameo and will allow people to replace faces in clips with their own beautiful visage.</p>
      <p>A deepfake video uses artificial intelligence to map the likeness of one person onto another.</p>
      <p>It’s feared that the technology will be used to destabilise society because it allows the creation of highly convincing fake news.</p>
      <p>But there are good reasons not to fear the arrival of Cameo.</p>
      <p>It’s being tested in France right now and is likely to be rolled out across the world in the coming weeks or months.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Snapchat said: ‘Cameos aren’t ready to take the stage yet, but stay tuned for their global debut soon.’</p>

      <p>Deepfake is a portmanteau combining the words ‘deep learning’ and ‘fake’, referring to simulated videos of human beings.</p>
      <p>Its power has been vividly showcased in footage which shows the</p>
      <p>The tech uses machine learning or artificial intelligence to combine digital images with audio files to make convincing-looking fake footage of people uttering words they’ve actually said.</p>
      <p>We’ve already it used to bring the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/03/deepfake-tech-brings-mona-lisa-life-9780172/">Mona Lisa spring to life, </a>whilst pornographers are already creating deepfake sex videos which make it look like mainstream stars are getting involved in the action.</p>
      <p>Politics is likely to be profoundly affected by the technology, which was demonstrated recently in a video which appeared to show<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-endorse-deepfakes-accurate-enough-fool-boomer-facebook-11088734/?ito=cbshare"> Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn endorsing each other. </a></p>
      <p>It’s easy to see how it could be used to make effective propaganda or sew distrust among citizens, who may become unable to work out if a video is fake or genuine.</p>
      <p>Snapchat’s own deepfake offering is not as sinister at it sounds for one simple reason: it’s not all that convincing yet.</p>
      <p>It will superimpose your face onto a video, sure, but the resulting creation is not particularly realistic.</p>
      <p>This means the feature is more suitable for comedy or the creation of bespoke reaction gifs than, you know, subverting democracy.</p>
      <p>Snapchat has created 150 looping video gifs for Cameo. You’ll be able to cut out an image of a face and then add it to an actor’s own features in one of these clips.</p>
      <p>You’ll also be able to easily send Cameos in chats.</p>
