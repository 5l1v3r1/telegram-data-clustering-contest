      <p>The married father of two daughters is adamant they follow him for the power of the gospels and not due to his appearance.</p>
      <p>Yet barrels of female followers post comments such as 'I love you' and 'you just keep blowing my mind' as well as putting numerous love heart emojis under his pictures.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/"><b>Times</b></a>: 'It's never a horrible thing to be told you're good-looking, but I think most people follow me because of my content, because I speak to them on a deeper level.'</p>
      <p>Rev Lee, who has been vicar at St Saviour's Church for four years, added: 'We get people every week saying they found us on Instagram.'</p>

      <p>But he finds the comparisons to Scott's character embarrassing and thinks it is just due to his age.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://inews.co.uk/light-relief/offbeat/meet-rev-chris-lee-leading-an-ecclesiastical-mission-on-youtube-and-instagram-825058"><b>iNews </b></a>last month: 'Priests traditionally are a little bit heavy, a little bit old and a little bit distant, and I am, I think, none of those things.'</p>
      <p>Scott's character was introduced in the second series of the show after he was brought in to officiate Fleabag's father and his second wife's wedding - and sparks immediately flew between the two of them.</p>
      <p>The sequel series ended with Fleabag and the Priest going their separate ways during a tearful goodbye at a bus stop.</p>
      <p>When Rev Lee was 21, he was working in business and had a house and a mortgage.</p>
      <p>But he decided to teach English in Tanzania and armed himself with a Bible as his main tool.</p>

      <p>After becoming engaged by his reading about God, he did a distance-learning degree to make him a priest.</p>
      <p>Aged 24 he was ordained a deacon in the diocese of Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>
      <p>The Church of England is trying to bolster its presence online and will today launch an app for Google Home smart speaker.</p>
      <p>The app will allow users to ask the device to say grace before meals as well as pray before bed.</p>
