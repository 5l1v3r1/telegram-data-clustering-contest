      <h1>How Chiefs Got The Edge Over Celtic  </h1>

      <p>Bloemfontein Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema applauded his Kaizer Chiefs counterpart Ernst Middendorp after Amakhosi came from behind three times during their Absa Premiership clash at the weekend to eventually win 5-3.</p>
      <p>Celtic exposed Chiefs’ lackluster defending in the first half, but could not keep up later on in the game as the log leaders fought back in the eight-goal thriller.</p>

      <p>“We created chances and played the way we wanted to play and until we conceded the two goals. We had done our homework and tried everything, but they proved too strong,” Seema told reporters after the game.</p>
      <p>“If someone is stronger than you in certain departments, you will always come out second best. They saw that set pieces would surely help them get the edge over us. We will have to go back and work hard again.”</p>
      <p>Seema said part of their surrender later in the match was due to not having their regulars against a full strength Chiefs outfit.</p>
      <p>“Not making an excuse, but we are patching up here and there because of the injuries – the experienced guys are not there. And when you come up against Chiefs, with a very good coach that I know very well, it was always going to be difficult,” the Celtic mentor explained.  </p>
      <p>“We haven’t played with the same squad we started the season with because of the injuries. We lost another centre-back again through suspension for the next match.”  </p>
