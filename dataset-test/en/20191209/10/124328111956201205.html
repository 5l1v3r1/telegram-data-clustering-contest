      <p>The Earl and Countess of Yarmouth have defended their decision to speak out against his family, after claiming they evicted him following a fallout in the summer.</p>
      <p>William Francis Seymour, 26, revealed in July how his family asked him to leave the cottage on the estate called The Bothy that he was living in with his then-pregnant wife Kelsey Wells, a city high-flyer, 34.</p>
      <p>As the firstborn son to Hugh Seymour, 8th Marquess of Hertford, William is heir to the £85m estate Ragley Hall, a magnificent Palladian mansion set in 5,000 acres, and has now said his three siblings have stopped speaking to him since his decision to speak about the family rift.</p>
      <p>William, whose ancestors include Henry VIII’s third wife, Jane Seymour, has now said that he and his wife have no regrets about 'setting the record straight' over the reported campaign of hostility they reportedly faced, which peaked when his aunt Lady Carolyn called him a 'pompous a**' in her RSVP to the couple’s wedding in June last year - even correcting the font and coronet they  used.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.tatler.com/article/earl-and-countess-of-yarmouth-family-fallout"><b>Tatler</b></a>, William revealed how his his three siblings, Lady Gabriella Helen Seymour, 28, Lord Edward George Seymour, 24, and Lady Antonia Louisa Seymour, 21, have barely spoken to him in the months after he spoke out against his family. </p>
      <p>Revealing that he just received one brief message from one sister reading 'WTF' following the interview, he said: 'On a personal level one big regret I have about what has been going on with my parents is that it has got in the way of the relationship I could have had with my sisters and brother.'</p>
      <p>Ensuring that his son's upbringing would be different from his own, he added: 'I really want to ensure that my son can talk to me about anything and everything.' </p>
      <p>Revealing why they spoke out about their situation, Kelsey, who reportedly gave birth this week, said: ‘The eviction of the Marquess of Hertford’s son from the family estate was not something that would go unnoticed, and rumours were beginning to circulate locally. </p>

      <p>‘We wanted to ensure that the historical record was accurate and felt it was appropriate to tell the real story.’ </p>
      <p>She added: 'I didn't ever see it as marrying into aristocracy. We should not define ourselves by the titles we have, or by association with an estate that one of us might have been fortunate enough to inherit. </p>
      <p>The couple briefly moved into Kelsey's parents' home after being evicted, before settling in a small cottage on the edge of the estate that William inherited from his grandfather. </p>
      <p>Speaking about the cottage they have, he joked: ‘You could fit the entire square footage of this cottage into the Great Hall at Ragley’. </p>

        <figcaption>Lady Carolyn Seymour wrote an astonishing response to her nephew's wedding invitation in which she ridiculed William, Earl of Yarmouth, as ‘pompous’ and ‘Little Lord Fauntleroy’ before turning her sights on his future bride</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In July the couple told how the hostility began when William first started dating Kelsey, and his bedroom and car was reportedly lent to other staff members in an 'effort to keep them from seeing each other'.</p>
      <p>Kelsey told how she felt as though the family's reported attitude towards her stemmed towards their fear of 'losing control of their son', and says they never warmed to her. </p>
      <p>They then revealed how his aunt had written an astonishing response to their 2018 wedding invite, replying: ‘[It’s] so embarrassingly awful, it’s almost laughable, if it weren’t so tragic. Since when do you start with the groom’s coronet on top of the page?</p>

        <figcaption>He said his aunt Lady Carolyn’s called him a 'pompous a**' in her RSVP to the couple’s wedding in June last year - even correcting the font and coronet they used</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>‘Moreover, you haven’t even used the Ragley blue nor the correct font. And since when does your name come before the bride?’</p>
      <p>She went on to berate William for suggesting how guests might dress. ‘Good God, what are you? Little Lord Fauntleroy?’ She then beseeched him to teach his fiancee the rules of etiquette: ‘I am The Lady Carolyn Seymour,’ she said, before signing off: ‘You pompous a**/t**/p***k – take your pick… Your ever-so loving aunt’.</p>
      <p>The couple now say they are following in the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's footsteps and say they plan to 'thrive, not just survive', and hope to mend bridges with his family.</p>
