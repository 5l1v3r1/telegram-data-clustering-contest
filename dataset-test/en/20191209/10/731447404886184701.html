      <p>Reaper 6 is out now. <br/><br/>The latest version of the Cockos-developed DAW introduces new upgrades to a package already renowned for its extensive and customisable feature set. <br/><br/>MIDI CC envelopes can now send curved messages to your hardware or software devices, meaning you get smooth, continuous parameter changes instead of discrete events. A new time-stretching algorithm, a graphic patchbay for advanced routing, embedded plug-in displays and improved performance in large projects are among the other improvements. Find out more details on the Reaper <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">website</a>. <br/><br/>Reaper 6 is only $60, which is considerably cheaper than more popular DAWs. The cost includes free updates until version 7.99. A full-featured 60 day demo is also available. <br/><br/>Learn how Joe uses Reaper in our <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3441">Art Of Production feature</a>.</p>
