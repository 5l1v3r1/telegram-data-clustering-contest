      <p>BISHKEK -- Kyrgyz prosecutors in a high-profile corruption trial have asked a court to sentence two former mayors of Bishkek to lengthy prison terms.</p>
      <p>The prosecutors asked the Lenin district court in Bishkek, on December 9, to sentence Albek Ibraimov to 20 years and Kubanychbek Kulmatov to 15 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Kulmatov ran the capital city in 2014-16 and Ibraimov in 2016-18. The two were charged along with 11 others for alleged corruption while in office.</p>
      <p>Both former officials served as mayors of Bishkek during the tenure of former President Almazbek Atambaev.</p>
      <p>Three days earlier, two former Kyrgyz prime ministers, Sapar Isakov and Jantoro Satybaldiev, were sentenced to 15 and 7 1/2 years in prison in another high-profile corruption case.</p>
      <p>That case was launched amid tensions between Atambaev and current incumbent Sooronbai Jeenbekov, an ex-prime minister who was tapped by Atambaev as his favored successor in Kyrgyzstan's October 2017 presidential election.</p>
      <p>Atambaev was arrested on August 8 after he surrendered to police following two days of violent resistance by supporters. He had refused to show up at police headquarters for questioning in an unrelated case.</p>
