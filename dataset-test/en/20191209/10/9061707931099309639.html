      <h1>'No great panic' says Clough after Pirelli disappointment</h1>
      <h2>Manager praises effort, admits tiredness was a factor but backs players all the way</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:27:06+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Burton Albion’s 2-0 home defeat against Lincoln City led to inevitable grumbling from some supporters but manager Nigel Clough remains convinced that the Brewers are on course in their League One season.</p>
      <p>An early goal by Harry Anderson, the second header conceded from a corner in a week, and a late one from Tyler Walker condemned Albion to a third home defeat of the season and they are 15th in the table today.</p>
      <p>The Brewers’ sixth game in 19 days appeared to be one too far against a Lincoln side who had played only one in the same period but Clough maintains his players’ efforts bodes well.</p>
      <p>“Lincoln did play well and, once we’d given them a goal after only two minutes, it ultimately decided the game,” said Clough.</p>
      <p>“We gave away a goal very similar to the one the other night (Tuesday against Southend) and then we were chasing the game at home for long periods of time.</p>
      <p>“The goal lifted Lincoln and they threw their bodies on the line in front of stuff and blocked shots but, apart from at set-plays, I didn’t think they bothered us too much.</p>
      <p>“One thing I am not disappointed about is the effort of the players. It was absolutely incredible on the back of what we’ve had in the last 10 days or two weeks. They gave absolutely every ounce of everything they had and that’s the bottom line, that’s what we ask for more than anything.</p>
      <p>“There’s no great panic. As long as we see the sort of effort we saw, and the quality, at times, we’ll back the players all day.”</p>
      <p>Asked the extent to which tiredness had played a part, Clough said: “It’s a little factor but I didn’t think we looked that tired. I thought we played well.</p>
      <p>“When you are tired, you can’t get the ball or keep the ball. I thought we kept the ball well and Stephen Quinn was again head and shoulders above anyone else on the pitch. We huffed and puffed but what we didn’t have was that individual piece of skill just to unlock their defence and get us a goal.</p>
      <p>“Scott Fraser gave us that on Tuesday night with a wonderful free kick but no-one could do that this time. In the final third, there were wasted crosses and things like that. We could have had a shout for a penalty. Scott thought he got caught but it would have been a difficult one for the referee to give. It wasn’t clear-cut.”</p>
      <p>Injuries stretched Burton again, with John Brayford, Oliver Sarkic and Reece Hutchinson missing from the match-day squad, while John-Joe O’Toole started a four-match suspension after his second red card of the season on Tuesday against Southend United.</p>

      <p>Albion also lost Nathan Broadhead after half-an-hour. The on-loan Everton youngster returned from a month out but pulled up and had to be replaced by David Templeton.</p>
      <p>“Nathan’s hamstring was tight again,” said Clough. “He had trained all week, with (physio) Nick Fenton initially, then he joined in with a full session and he thought he was fully fit but it has tightened up again. It’s a big blow for us because, after those first two minutes, he and Liam Boyce were causing them problems. I thought we were looking good at that point.”</p>
      <p>At least, this time, Clough did not end the game bemoaning a refereeing performance, as Blackburn official Ben Toner controlled the game without controversy.</p>
      <p>“Having talked about the referee the other night, I thought the referee today was excellent,” added Clough. “There was one booking, for Ryan Edwards, that was a bit inconsistent but other than that he was excellent.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Burton Albion left-back Colin Daniel found himself in the spotlight again for all the wrong reasons after the Brewers’ 2-0 defeat at home to Lincoln City.</p>
      <p>Praised in midweek by manager Nigel Clough for his efforts in two games since returning to the starting line-up, Daniel (pictured) had nonetheless been singled out as the defender who lost his man at a corner for Southend United’s goal on Tuesday night. Against Lincoln, Clough was annoyed that Daniel gave the ball away cheaply within seconds of the start, which led to two corners, with Lincoln scoring from the second.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t the corner so much, as we knew they would be a threat at those, as the way we gave the ball away five seconds after the kick-off,” said Clough.</p>
      <p>“That was Colin Daniel, who had the ball at his feet and basically didn’t do what he’d been asked to do. Colin has come back into the team and has played, generally, OK but he has cost us two vitally important goals in two games. Sometimes, we might have to sacrifice a little bit of what he gives us going forward because he’s a defender and his job is not to give goals away.</p>
      <p>“He put one magnificent ball across the face of the goal, which Lucas Akins got a toe on and so nearly finished, and we remember the ball he put in last week at Oldham for Liam Boyce to tap in, which won us the game. So it’s there, it just has to come more consistently.”</p>
