      <p>Archipalago aka Palago Mufasa has attacked Shatta Wale for hiring a chopper just to get Cardi B’s attention.</p>
      <p>Dancehall artiste Shatta Wale yesterday pulled a surprise after he showed up at the Accra Sports stadium for his soundcheck with a helicopter before heading to his hotel room to rest ahead of the concert later in the evening.</p>
      <p>Some few hours after this, Shatta Wale took to social media to laugh at the celebrities who had gone to the Kempinski Grand Hotel to have a ‘Meet and Greet’ session with Cardi B but were disappointed.</p>
      <p>That didn’t end there as he posted on his page again hammering on the fact that Ghana is still a village.</p>
      <p>He posted: <i>“WHEN I SAY GHANA BE VILLAGE…..DEM GO TALK SAY WHY”</i></p>
      <p>But Archipalago who has been trolling the celebrities after the incident sent an epic respond to Shatta Wale</p>
      <p>He responded: <i>“U made it look more village by hiring a helicopter just for #CardiB to recognize you ???Kwasia Banku Abeteku”</i></p>
