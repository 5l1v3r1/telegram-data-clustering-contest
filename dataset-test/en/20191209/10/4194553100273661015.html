      <h1>(Video) Brilliant Andy Robertson song based on Gerry Cinnammon’s ‘Belter’ goes viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:33:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/washngog/" target="_blank">Wash N'Gog</a></address>
      <p>This would be a tricky one for the Kop to blare out in unison, but how good would it sound?!</p>
      <p>Andy Robertson’s current song is a pretty easy one to remember – and anyone who’s been to Anfield over the past 18 months will have head ‘Oh, Andy Andy!’ sung at one point…</p>
      <p>But how about this remix of Gerry Cinnammon’s classic ‘Belter’ as seen in the video below?</p>
      <p>It’s a quality song, and suits Robbo perfectly as the original singer is a very well-loved Scot, too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“And when he plays the Blue Sh*te he will leave the elbow in, he’s Andy Robbo…” is a particular favourite line of ours! </b>
      </p>
      <p>Props to the lad in the video:</p>
