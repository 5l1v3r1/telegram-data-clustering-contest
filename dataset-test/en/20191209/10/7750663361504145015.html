      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> assistant <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikel-arteta/"><b>Mikel Arteta</b></a> has allegedly emerged as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a>'s priority target to replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Since the Gunners made the decision to part ways with the Spaniard last month, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/freddie-ljungberg/"><b>Freddie Ljungberg</b></a> has taken over on an interim basis.</p>
      <p>However, with the North London side having picked up just one point from Premier League fixtures against Norwich City and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion respectively, the club's board has stepped up their efforts to bring in a long-term replacement.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Express</i>, Arsenal have now settled on Arteta as their first choice, despite the fact that the Spaniard missed out on the role just 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that Arsenal now face a battle to tempt their former player into leaving his position at the Etihad Stadium midway through the campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a> has recently insisted that Arteta will at least see out the season in the North-West.</p>
