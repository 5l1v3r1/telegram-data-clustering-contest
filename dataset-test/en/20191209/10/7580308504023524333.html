      <p>The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Niger says 12 people have died in an accident on Sunday at Sawmill village along Mokwa -Makera road in Mokwa Local Government Area of the state.</p>
      <p>The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Mr Joel Dagwa, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Minna that the accident involved a Truck Container with registration No. KJ 555 XX heading to Lagos.</p>
      <p>Dagwa said that the Truck that came from Maiduguri, picked passengers from Zaria in Kaduna State before heading to Lagos.</p>
      <p>” The accident involved 103 people, 55 females, 40 males, 8 children’s, 5 adults, 12 of them were killed while 91 sustained injuries and taken to Mokwa general hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>“All the 12 corpses have been deposited at the hospital’s morgue,” he said.</p>
