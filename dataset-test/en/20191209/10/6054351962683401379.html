      <h1>Nick Cannon Calls Out Kim, Hailie &amp; Alaina On Suge Knight-Led Eminem Diss Track 'The Invitation'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:03:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/trent.clark" target="_blank">Trent Clark</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles, CA – The nonstop war of words between Eminem and Nick Cannon has just elevated to yet another level.</p>
      <p>Following Slim Shady’s latest retort towards the Power 106 radio host’s family via Fat Joe’s <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53713/title.eminem-takes-shots-at-nick-cannon-mariah-carey-on-fat-joe-track-lord-above">“Lord Above,”</a> Cannon has fired back his own shots with his new diss record “The Invitation” — and he didn’t mince words.</p>
      <p>“Call Kim, somebody get Hailie/And that other kid you raisin’ that ain’t even your baby (Daddy)/Took <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.34851/title.drake-releases-second-meek-mill-diss-track-back-to-back-freestyle">a page out of Drake book</a>/This might get a Grammy/We going back to back ’til you respond on the family,” Cannon spewed on the track, a direct jab at his famous foe’s family members.</p>

      <p>The Hitmaka-produced diss also features contributions from Hitman Holla, Charlie Clips and Prince Eazy, as well as an instigating intro from none other than the incarcerated former music mogul, <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53686/title.suge-knight-gives-wendy-williams-a-message-through-ray-j-gets-conviction-thrown-in-his-face">Suge Knight</a>, who risked getting a demerit with his vulgar phone time.</p>
      <p>“Eminem’s a bitch,” Knight, who is currently serving a 28-year prison sentence for manslaughter, quips during the opening soundscape.</p>
      <p>On the aforementioned record “Lord Above,” Eminem unleashed a lyrical fury in Cannon’s direction when he spit, “I know me and Mariah didn’t end on a high note/But that other dude’s whipped, that pussy got him neutered/Tryna tell him his chicks a nut ‘fore he got his jewels clipped/Almost got my caboose kicked/Fool, quit, you not gon’ do shit/I let her chop my balls off too before I lost to you, Nick.”</p>
      <p>Cannon initially felt the insults <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53722/title.nick-cannon-says-eminem-diss-isnt-worthy-of-a-response-while-responding">weren’t worthy of a response</a> but during his official reaction to the track, listeners could see the emotions brewing, hence “The Invitation” was born.</p>
