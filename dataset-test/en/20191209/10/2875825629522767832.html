      <h2>Queen of the Jungle Jacqueline Jossa looked very loved-up with Dan as they enjoyed time together on the beach following 'cheating' rumours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:39:06+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:39</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa and her hunky husband Dan Osborne looked super cosy on the beach after she was crowned the Queen of the Jungle.</p>
      <p>The pair shrugged off all circulating rumours of Dan's infidelity to his former EastEnders actress wife.</p>
      <p>Former Towie star Dan, 28, was pictured making his wife, 27, laugh while he goes in for a hug after the pair were apart for three weeks.</p>
      <p>They enjoyed some family time with their children on a very crowded and busy beach.</p>
      <p>Jac looked stunning in a frilly floral print dress and her long brunette hair falling over her shoulders, while Dan got his abs out and went shirtless to show off his tattooed body.</p>
      <p>He was seen cupping her face in one snap and leaning in towards her for what looks like a cheeky kiss.</p>
      <p>It comes after the couple - who have been married just over two years - faced trouble after threesome slurs.</p>

      <p>Model <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-chloe-ayling-celebrity-big-13077500">Chloe Ayling</a> came forward to say she had a threesome with Dan and CBB star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-natalie-nunn-celebrity-big-13090053">Natalie Nunn</a> after a wild night out.</p>
      <p>The model said she wanted to confess because she felt bad for Dan's wife Jacqueline who will be unaware of the new claims.</p>
      <p>She claimed to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10492866/chloe-ayling-dan-osborne-threesome-jacqueline-jossa-threesome/">The Sun</a> that after a night of boozing and partying - which saw the stars papped together - they went back to a hotel and engaged in sexual activity together.</p>
      <p>Chloe claims that she watched Dan have full sex with Natalie, who was married to Jacob at the time, before kissing and performing a sex act on Chloe.</p>

      <p>Dan has also faced a number of cheating claims in the past, including rumours that he hooked up with former Love Island babe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , but he has always protested his innocence, as has Gabby.</p>
      <p>It has also been reported that Myles told Jacqueline in unaired scenes that he believed something had happened between his ex-girlfriend Gabby and Dan.</p>
