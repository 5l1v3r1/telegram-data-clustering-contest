      <p>His office is the rear of the shop previously operated by his father.</p>
      <p>He lives around 200m away.</p>
      <p>Mr Healy-Rae raced to ensure the property was empty after realising a fire had broken out.</p>
      <p>The local fire brigade were immediately alerted.</p>
      <p>It is understood the TD was checking that the property was empty and was attempting to save a number of important files when he was partially overcome by smoke.</p>
      <p>He was treated at the scene by a doctor before the decision was taken to transfer him to hospital for precautionary tests.</p>
      <p>A local ambulance brought him to Kerry hospital.</p>
      <p>He is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Independent.ie, his brother Danny Healy-Rae said Michael would be okay.</p>
      <p>"He will be fine. He has been taken to hospital as a precaution. They want to give him an x-ray," he said.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the cause of the blaze is underway but the belief is that the fire was accidental.</p>
      <p>The fire was quickly extinguished by Kerry Fire Brigade.</p>
      <p>Four years ago, Mr Healy-Rae narrowly avoided serious injury when he was attacked by a cow on the family farm.</p>
