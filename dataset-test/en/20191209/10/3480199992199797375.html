      <p>Amongst those present were the Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire, Anna Turner; the High Sheriff Dr Josh Dixey and the Mayor Councillor Phil Gillam.</p>
      <p>Rotarians from the three Shrewsbury Rotary clubs were joined by members of the public for the service conducted by Preb David Crowhurst, President of the Rotary Club of Church Stretton.</p>
      <p>The Tree of Light was brought to Shrewsbury almost 30 years’ ago by former Rotarian Paul Firmin to benefit charities and good causes.</p>
      <p>Since then the Rotary Tree of Light has raised more than £140,000 and this year’s beneficiaries will be The Samaritans, Parkinson’s and the Food Hub, all recognised as ‘deserving’ causes.</p>
      <p>The Tree of Light presents an opportunity to make a donation of £5 or more in memory of a loved one and those wishing to donate can contact Rotarian Mike Haw on 01743 240356.</p>
      <p>Taking part in the service were the choir Of One Accord.</p>
      <p>The names of donors and those commemorated are displayed around the Tree and in the Shrewsbury Chronicle.</p>
