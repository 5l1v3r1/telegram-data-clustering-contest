      <p>With the final three couples announced for the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> Grand Final next week, there was heartbreak when comedian <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-chris-ramsey-eliminated-in-semi-final/">Chris Ramsey and his pro partner Karen Hauer were eliminated</a> from this weekend's semi-final.</p>
      <p>But during last night's results show (8.12.19), judge Bruno Tonioli had to stop and reshoot a line because he feared he would offend the audience.</p>

      <p>Chris and Karen - along with Karim Zeroual and his partner Amy Dowden - competed in the dance-off.</p>
      <p>As Chris and Karen prepared to re-dance the rumba, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10510100/strictly-bruno-tonioli-fat-snowflakes/">The Sun</a> reports that Bruno offered some advice: "It’s not over until the fat lady sings," he said.</p>
      <p>But he reportedly asked for a re-shoot, saying: "Oh, I can’t say that any more. You can’t say ‘fat’ on TV."</p>

      <p>The publication quotes a source as saying: "Bruno is just conscious about offending people.</p>
      <p>"It’s the last thing he’d want to do so it’s better just to be safe.</p>
      <aside>The audience didn’t have any issue but accepted it’s the new world we’re living in.</aside>
      <p>"The BBC are incredibly sensitive right now. Obviously it’s filtering down to its stars. The audience didn’t have any issue but accepted it’s the new world we’re living in."</p>
      <p>ED! has contacted the BBC for comment.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately for Chris, 33, the judges unanimously voted to keep Karim and Amy and send them into next week's final.</p>
      <p>Already there was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders'</a> Emma Barton and her pro partner Anton Du Beke - making only his second final in 15 years - and ex-<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> actor Kelvin Fletcher and his partner, Oti Mabuse.</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to his partner Karen, Chris said: "I'm very proud of myself. I had genuinely no expectations. I thought I'd be gone by week two.</p>
      <p>"I've got to thank [Karen]... she's amazing, the best teacher. She's so good at her job, and so patient. So patient!"</p>
