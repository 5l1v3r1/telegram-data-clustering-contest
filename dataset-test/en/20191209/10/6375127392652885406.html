      <h3>THE Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) relaunches its Pasig River Ferry Service (PRFS) with free ride offer until January 31, 2020 yesterday morning in Manila’s Lawton.</h3>
      <p>Senator Bong Go, MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim, Department of Transportation (DOTr)  Secretary Arthur Tugade, Department of Environment Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Roy Cimatu and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno were present during the ceremony at 10 a.m.</p>
      <p>“The Pasig River ferry service has been an alternative mode of transport for Metro Manila commuters who want to avoid the busy streets of Metro Manila. They can enjoy ferry rides between Pasig City and Manila for free until the end of January ,” said Lim.</p>
      <p>“With the government’s collective effort and President Duterte’s order, Pasig River is now clean from floating garbage so aside from the ferry service being an alternative mode of transport, commuters can now enjoy the beauty of the river while on cruise,” Go added.</p>
      <p>Go encouraged the concerned government officials to find ways and source funds for it to be free until the end of 2020.  He added that the renewed beauty of the 25-kilometer river will attract more ferry service passengers.</p>
      <p>According to Lim, the free ferry transportation program hopes to encourage the public to patronize the ferry service over public utility vehicles and avoid the hassles of commuting in congested Metro Manila roads. Commuters will be accommodated on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
      <p>In preparation for the re-launch, Lim ordered the refurbishment of ferry stations and the sourcing of additional boats to further serve passengers better.</p>
      <p>Lim also thanked the local chief executives of Metro Manila for their support to the project, especially Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto who provided two newly procured ferry boats which are now part of the PRFS fleet.</p>
