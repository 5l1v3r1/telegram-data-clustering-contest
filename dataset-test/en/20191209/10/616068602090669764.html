      <p>This year's annual "WestJet Christmas Miracle" video showcases families as they decide whether to give or receive.</p>
      <p>The video was filmed at a Christmas market in Toronto where guests were given the opportunity to enter a giant Santa hat.</p>
      <p>The video showcases a holographic Blue Santa along with Ebenezer Scrooge as they let families decide to give away or walk away with the gifts they find.</p>
      <p>“The conversation around giving and receiving is a powerful one, and this year’s video finds inspiration in both sides of the story,” said Richard Bartrem, WestJet vice-president of marketing communications.</p>
      <p>“The authentic reactions and emotions ... make this year’s Christmas Miracle truly heartwarming.”</p>
      <p>The gifts included a $2,500 WestJet gift card, beach vacations and more, and the choice was left up to the people to either keep the gift or give it to a family with sick children who are staying at a Ronald McDonald House.</p>
      <p>Touching moments were captured, and Santa made it clear there were no wrong answers.</p>
      <p>Those who gave away their gifts were invited to a celebration at the Ronald McDonald House in Hamilton, Ont.</p>
      <p>"For over 10 years, our incredible partners at WestJet have helped us keep families from across Canada close together during a very difficult time in their lives,” said Cathy Loblaw, CEO of RMHC Canada.</p>
      <p>“We are so humbled by the generosity of Canadian families who chose to donate their gifts to Ronald McDonald House families this holiday season, giving them the greatest gift of all – family.”</p>
      <p>The magical holographs in the video were created by ARHT Media Inc.</p>
