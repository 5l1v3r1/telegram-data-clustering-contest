      <p>Google on Friday added a range of new features to Google Assistant in an effort to simplify voice-enabled productivity.</p>
      <p>“Starting to roll out today, you can use your Assistant to create and manage your notes and lists in Google Keep, Any.do, AnyList, or Bring! across Assistant-enabled phones and smart speakers,” the company said on its <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/5-ways-beat-holiday-stress-google-assistant/">news blog</a>.</p>
      <p>Users can now enable support for third party list apps via the Assistant, where they can say things like “Hey Google, create a holiday gift list”. Additionally, users can use the Assistant to search for and listen to podcasts too.</p>
      <p>“When you ask the Assistant for podcasts about a certain topic — ‘Hey Google, find a podcast about holiday cooking’ — it’ll suggest relevant episodes for you,” Google explained.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, users can also ask the Assistant to search for photos and share them directly by saying “Hey Google, look up photos from this weekend”.</p>
      <p>According to Google, the new features are available on all Assistant-enabled phones.</p>
      <p>In November, the company also released a <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/google-assistant-latest-news-united-states/">news-reading Assistant feature</a> in the United States.</p>
