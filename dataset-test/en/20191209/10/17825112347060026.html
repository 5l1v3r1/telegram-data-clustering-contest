      <p>Cape Town - As South Africans brace for a dark festive season, experts have offered useful tips and tricks to help deal with ongoing load shedding.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning, Eskom announced that the planned Stage 2 load shedding would move to stage 4 from 10am until 11pm due to additional loss of units at its power stations.</p>
      <p>The entity also said the probability of load shedding remained high for the week as a result of a shortage of capacity.</p>
      <p>To help deal with this, Budget Insurance has offered various ways consumers can cope with the ongoing power cuts, all while saving money and looking after the environment.</p>
      <p>“Many South Africans are left scratching their heads on how to cope with high energy prices, as well as how to curb load shedding and its effects on their businesses and homes,” says Budget Insurance's Susan Steward. </p>
