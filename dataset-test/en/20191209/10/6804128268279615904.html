      <h1>Jose Mourinho makes former Manchester United star "priority" for Spurs' January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Spurs boss Jose Mourinho has reportedly made one of his former Manchester United stars a priority for his transfer business in the January window</h2>

      <p>Spurs manager Jose Mourinho has reportedly made one of his former stars at Manchester United a priority to sign in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was sacked at Old Trafford a year ago, and is apparently eyeing a reunion with one midfielder who has also since left the north west of England.</p>
      <p>Following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's appointment, Marouane Fellaini saw his playing time decrease, and left at the end of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old made the move to Shandong in China, but according to <a href="https://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/diablesrouges/mercato-marouane-fellaini-le-special-one-de-jose-mourinho-5ded53479978e272f96db972?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Les Sports</a>, Mourinho is hoping to bring the towering midfielder back to the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Mourinho is notorious for forging close bonds with some players, and has apparently made contact with the 6ft 4in star about a potential move to north London after developing a good relationship in Manchester.</p>

      <p>Fellaini is still under contract until December 2021 with the option of signing for an additional year, but will not be in action until at least the end of February when the Chinese football season begins again.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's midfield is already well-stacked, with the likes of Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso arriving in the summer to supplement the likes of Harry Winks, Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko.</p>
      <p>However, Mourinho has apparently set his heart on adding the Belgian midfielder to the ranks.</p>
