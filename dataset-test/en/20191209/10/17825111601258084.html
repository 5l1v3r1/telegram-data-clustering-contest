      <p>Johannesburg - Former anti-apartheid activist and economics professor Ben Turok had died, his family confirmed on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Turok died in the early hours of Monday morning, his family said in a statement. He was 92. </p>
      <p>“The Turok family are very sad to announce the passing of Ben Turok, their much-loved husband, father, uncle, grandfather and great grandfather, in the early hours of Monday, December 9, aged 92.</p>
      <p>"He was always outspoken and dedicated his whole life to fighting for freedom, equality and social justice in South Africa. He was a loyal, lifetime member of the ANC, but retained an independent perspective throughout."</p>
      <p>The family said Turok had asked for his death to be marked by a private ceremony "rather than anything official or formal, in view of the present predicament facing the country".</p>
