      <p>Lavish has also won acknowledgement from the likes of UK rappers Stormzy, Michael Dapaah (Big Shaq), Coach K, Krept, Sneakbo among others. Another winner was Zimbabwean music producer Rodney ‘Rymez’ Hwingwiri who has made hits for British rapper/singer Stefflon Don.</p>
      <p>The awards, which last year brought singer Baba Harare as their headline performer, were set up to celebrate and recognise exceptional young Zimbabweans in the UK.</p>
      <p>The award for <b>Upcoming Musician of the Yea</b>r was shared between ZimChild and Vimbai Rose, the daughter of the late singer Culture T, (member of reggae outfit Transit Crew). Culture T died in the UK in 2006 and Vimbai’s mother used the time for her speech to remind the crowd of his legacy.</p>
