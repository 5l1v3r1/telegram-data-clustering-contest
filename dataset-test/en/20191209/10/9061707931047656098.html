      <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/weather">warning for heavy winds in Derbyshire</a>, meaning power cuts are possible.</p>
      <p>People across the county have been told to expect delays to <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/traffic-and-travel">road, rail and air transport</a> are likely as a result of winds that may reach up to 60mph.</p>
      <p>Bus and train services are expected to be affected, with some journeys taking longer and being made worse by spray and surface water.</p>
      <p>High sided vehicles like buses and lorries may have issues travelling on exposed routes and bridges.</p>
      <p>The warning is in place until lunchtime today, Monday, December 9.</p>
      <p>Met Office officials have also said "short term loss of power and other services is possible".</p>
      <p>They say on their website: "Gusts of wind can unsettle vehicles, grip your steering wheel firmly with both hands. This is particularly important when planning to overtake.</p>
      <p>"Keep an eye out for gaps between trees, buildings or bridges over a river or railway, these are some of the places you are more likely to be exposed to side winds.</p>
      <p>"Ensure that you maintain enough room either side of your vehicle so you can account for it being blown sideways."</p>
