      <h1>After WADA's four-year doping ban, Russia set to miss 2020 Olympics</h1>
      <h2>A spokesperson for WADA, whose executive committee is meeting in Lausanne, said: "The full list of recommendations have been unanimously accepted</h2>

      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday banned Russia from global sporting events including the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/2020-tokyo-olympics">2020 Tokyo Olympics </a>and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics after accusing Moscow of falsifying data from an anti-doping laboratory.</p>
      <p>"The full list of recommendations have been unanimously accepted," said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wada">WADA </a>spokesman James Fitzgerald, speaking at a meeting of the body's executive committee in Lausanne.</p>
      <p>"WADA's executive committee approved unanimously to assert a non-compliance on the Russian anti-doping agency for a period of four years," he added.</p>
      <p>The ruling means Russian athletes will still be allowed to compete at the Tokyo Olympics as neutrals, but only if they can demonstrate that they were not part of what <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wada">WADA </a>believes was a state-sponsored system of doping.</p>
      <p>"They are going to have prove they had nothing to do with the non-compliance, (that) they were not involved in the doping schemes as described by the McLaren report, or they did not have their samples affected by the manipulation," Fitzgerald said.</p>
      <p>The independent McLaren report, released in 2016, revealed the significant extent of state-sponsored doping in Russia, notably between 2011-15.</p>
