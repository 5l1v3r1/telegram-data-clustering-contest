      </p>
      <p>It looks like Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt’s upcoming fantasy drama – Brahmastra – is one highly jinxed project, and we aren’t just saying it. The film, which was initially slated to release in December this month, got pushed to summer 2020 citing some heavily pending VFX work. And now, if the recent report in Bollywood Hungama is anything to go by, Brahmastra has been postponed further to winter 2020, i.e., almost the end of next year.  A source close to the film’s development told the portal that this time, too, VFX is the cause behind the delay. (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/brahmastra-lovebirds-ranbir-kapoor-alia-bhatt-strike-a-serious-pose-in-the-icy-hills-of-manali-pics/5de6013502fcc96b801dac8f">Brahmastra: Lovebirds Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt Strike A Serious Pose In The Icy Hills Of Manali – PICS</a>)</p>
      <p>The source said, "A major chunk of VFX is still pending which includes the stuff shot with Shah Rukh Khan at a studio in Mumbai, and the plot that unfolds in Manali and Varanasi. The company working on the visual effects has conveyed to the producers that they won't be able to get the film ready by summer due to complexities in the visual effects, which have come across as a shock to everyone working on the film.” They added how Karan Johar and Ayan Mukerji aren’t keen on treating audiences with a half-baked product and hence giving their best to the film’s visual effects.</p>

      <p>Further, the source stated how Karan and Ayan are confident that once Brahmastra’s trailer and the teaser are dropped online, fans will be blown away by its spectacular visuals. Once the team gets a thumbs up from the VFX department, they will be officially announcing Brahmastra’s new release date with a poster or a teaser. We wait!</p>
