      <p>“People, my father is not Courtney Walsh,” is what Hayden Walsh has to keep reminding anyone who thinks that he is a progeny of one of West Indies’ pace bowling greats.</p>
      <p>However after an impactful performance against India, the 27-year-old leg-spinner is confident that he will now be able to carve an identity of his own, where deceptive googlies will be discussed more than lethal bouncers.</p>
      <p>“I was playing in the Cananda T20 league and someone called me Courtney Walsh (laughs). So yeah…People my father is not Courtney Walsh. But I guess now they will now find out who I am and who is my father,” Walsh, who had figures of 2/28, including wickets of Shivam Dube and Shreyas Iyer said after the match.</p>
      <p>He foxed a rampaging Dube with a loopy googly outside the off-stump, a trait he has developed bowling to southpaws like Evin Lewis and Nicholas Pooran.</p>
      <p>“I was bowling a lot to Evin (Lewis) and Nicholas (Pooran) in the nets. I was a bit confident coming in to bowl to him (Dube),” Walsh said.</p>
      <p>He was visibly elated as he is finally finding his feet in international cricket.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, it has been like a roller-coaster ride for me. As you can see, I have been working hard trying to find my way to the top into international cricket. Just to be here and perform in a game is just. I am over the moon,” he added.</p>
      <p>He credited his consistent show in the Caribbean Premier League as one of the reasons for his success.</p>
      <p>“I did well in the Caribbean Premier League and it obviously caught the selectors’ eye. I bowled a lot in the nets and it helped me here,” Walsh said.</p>
      <p>He wouldn’t mind IPL scouts taking a note of his performances but the primary goal now will be to win the series.</p>
      <p>“Yeah well, the main thing is more to win the series. The goal is just winning this series and to help the team do their best.”</p>
      <p>To a question if winning the toss was crucial for the Windies, Walsh replied: “Yeah, I think the toss as you saw in Hyderabad, it was very important because of the dew factor. I don’t think dew was much of a factor tonight.</p>
      <p>“But knowing that we were going to bowl first and we have such a strong bowling team. Once we do well, we would be able to restrict them to a good total.”</p>
