      <p>I'm A Celebrity 2019 winner Jacqueline Jossa is doing "fine" after her win, according to runner-up Andy Whyment.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> actor, who plays Kirk Sutherland on the ITV soap, revealed the former EastEnders actress had a "tough time" in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline broke down in tears as Ant and Dec crowned her Queen of the Jungle on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>She then had an emotional reunion with husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> on the bridge, before finally being reunited with her two young daughters Ella and Mia at the hotel.</p>
      <p>Andy and co-star Kate Garraway appeared on Good Morning Britain on Monday morning to discuss the final.</p>

      <p>Fresh from the news that Jacqueline had cancelled all live TV interviews following her win, because of other filming and wanting to spend time with her family, Andy praised the star.</p>
      <p>He said she was "fine" but "dazed" after winning the series, as he referenced her "tough time" in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Andy told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: "She’s fine, we’ve just done some filming for the Coming Out show.</p>
      <p>"She looks fine, she's got a magnificent dress on and she's still got her crown on. She had a tough time in there at times, she’s done really well."</p>

      <p>Kate added that viewers will love the sweet moment when Jacqueline sees her children for the first time.</p>
      <p>It comes after reports earlier on in the series, that Jacqueline's campmate Myles Stephenson spoke to her about rumours his ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> had slept with her husband Dan.</p>
      <p>The fling claims emerged after pictures of the pair together at a bootcamp last year, with Dan and Gabby fiercely denying anything ever happened between them.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline is said to have been threatening to quit the series after Myles apparently told her what he believed happened between Gabby and Dan.</p>

      <p>Towards the end of the series, Dan was faced with fresh cheating claims by former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> co-star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-chloe-ayling-celebrity-big-13077500">Chloe Ayling</a> , who claimed she had a "threesome" with him and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-natalie-nunn-celebrity-big-13090053">Natalie Nunn</a> .</p>
      <p>Dan hit back at the claims, denying anything happened, as he shared mass support for his wife online ahead of her win.</p>
      <p>As the pair reunited on the bridge, Dan picked a sobbing Jacqueline up and embraced her, before the couple smiled for photos.</p>
      <p>He then joined her as they made their way back to the hotel, where she ran to meet her young daughters who were waiting with her parents.</p>
