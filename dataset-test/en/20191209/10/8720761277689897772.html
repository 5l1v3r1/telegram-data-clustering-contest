      <p>An anonymous reader shares a report:<i> Verizon, which bought Yahoo in 2017, has suspended email addresses of archivists who are trying to preserve 20 years of content that will be deleted permanently in a few weeks. As Verizon announced in October, the company intends to <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/10/16/1928228/yahoo-groups-is-winding-down-and-all-content-will-be-permanently-removed">wipe all content from Yahoo Groups</a>. As of December 14, all previously posted content on the site will be permanently removed. The mass deletion includes files, polls, links, photos, folders, database, calendar, attachments, conversations, email updates, message digests, and message histories that was uploaded to Yahoo servers since pre-Google 1990s. Verizon planned to allow users to download their own data from the site's privacy dashboard, but <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/verizon-kills-email-accounts-of-archivists-trying-to-save-yahoo-groups-history/">apparently it has a problem with the work of The Archive Team</a> who wants to save content to upload it to the non-profit Internet Archive, which runs the popular Wayback Machine site. <br/><br/>"Yahoo banned all the email addresses that the Archive Team volunteers had been using to join Yahoo Groups in order to download data," reported the Yahoo Groups Archive Team. "Verizon has also made it impossible for the Archive Team to continue using semi-automated scripts to join Yahoo Groups -- which means each group must be rejoined one by one, an impossible task (redo the work of the past four weeks over the next 10 days)."</i></p>
