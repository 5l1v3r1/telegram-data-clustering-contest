      <h2>Walsall boss Darrell Clarke has challenged his strikers to improve their play with their backs to goal after his side’s 1-0 win away at Port Vale.</h2>

      <p>Forward Elijah Adebayo got the only goal of the game in the first minute of the second half.</p>
      <p>A superb defensive display secured the three points but Clarke was unhappy with his team’s possession of the ball.</p>
      <p>“We have to be better with our back to play, strikers look after the ball,” he said. “I can’t remember how many times we’ve given the ball away with our back to play.</p>
      <p>“Just keep the ball, find the pass, make another movement. The basics of possession football.</p>
      <p>“It’s something we have to look at and obviously improve on.</p>
      <p>“Against Chelsea I thought for 70 minutes we were outstanding with the ball, moving it on the front foot.</p>
      <p>“But it’s three points away from home which in this league is very hard to come by.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take the positives, I know I’m just a miserable git but it’s just the way I am.”</p>
      <p>Midfielder Stuart Sinclair returned to the side after missing eight games through an unspecified injury.</p>
      <p>The experienced battler lasted the full 90 minutes at Vale Park and Clarke was pleased to have him back.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to have the beard running around isn’t it,” he added. “His heart and desire. It’s testament to the way he looks after himself to get 90 minutes.”</p>
