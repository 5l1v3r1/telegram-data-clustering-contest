      <h1>Rapper Juice Wrld dies at 21 after seizure</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:12:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/andrew-barker/" target="_blank">Andrew Barker</a></address>
      <p>Juice Wrld, the fast-rising young American rapper best known for his 2018 hit <i>Lucid Dreams</i>, has died shortly after suffering a seizure at Chicago’s Midway Airport. He was 21 years old.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said that Jarad A. Higgins had died on Sunday, according to <i>The New York Times</i>. The statement did not give a cause of death.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by TMZ, which cited law enforcement sources saying that the rapper experienced a seizure while walking through the airport, and was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after.</p>
      <p>Born and raised in Chicago, Juice had enjoyed a rapid ascension since he first began posting his songs to SoundCloud as a teenager in 2015, working in a style that blended elements of emo and rock with hip-hop.</p>
      <p>His independently-released 2017 track <i>Lucid Dreams</i> proved to be a career-maker, rising steadily until an official single release in 2018 broke him on to the pop charts, where the song would peak at No. 2.</p>

      <p>Signing to Interscope Records in early 2018, Juice released his debut album, <i>Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance</i>, almost immediately after, which was certified platinum before the end of the year, and contained yet another No. 2 single in <i>All Girls Are the Same</i>.</p>
      <p>His busy year continued with a summer in memoriam EP dedicated to late fellow SoundCloud rappers XXXTentacion and Lil Peep; a collaborative album with Future, <i>Wrld on Drugs</i>, which reached No. 2 on the album chart in October; and an original song on the soundtrack for the film <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i>.</p>
      <p>Juice released his second album, <i>Death Race for Love</i>, earlier this year. It was his first effort to reach No. 1 on the album chart. Also this year, he toured Europe with Nicki Minaj on a co-headlining bill.</p>
