        <b>Around the world, ocean-impact accelerators are emerging as societies start to realise the importance of focusing efforts and investments towards healthier oceans.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taking part in this exhilarating new movement, the <i>OceanHub Africa </i>launched their <i>Ocean Innovation Africa</i> event in <a href="https://www.esi-africa.com/tag/city-of-cape-town/">Cape Town,</a> supported by Wesgro, the South African French Embassy, the University of Cape Town and the V&amp;A Waterfront.</p>
      <p>Fifty carefully selected stakeholders from various backgrounds including entrepreneurs, researchers, investors, ocean business owners, non-profits and local authorities gathered to co-create the initiative’s roadmap in a bid to shape a future where both humans and oceans can thrive. </p>
      <p><i>OceanHub Africa</i> is on a mission to inspire and support ocean-minded start-ups with the express aim of nurturing an environmentally conscious and profitable economy that effectively mitigates the effects of global warming as well as the overexploitation and pollution of the oceans.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>it will provide a physical working space, access to tailored mentorship, business and scientific expertise; access to market leads;</li>
        <li>hands-on services from corporate partners (including cloud &amp; IT services, engineering and software suite for prototyping and testing, to name but a few) and</li>
        <li>support along the fundraising journey, from pitching to structuring deals. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>OceanHub Africa </i>is also offering a technology transfer support programme that promotes collaboration between researchers and entrepreneurs for science-based innovation.</p>
      <p>By partnering with local universities, its objective is to find commercial use of scientific patents through the identification of transferable technologies and the incubation of selected projects.</p>
      <p>This programme will strengthen the pipeline of ocean-minded start-ups and leverage the knowledge that lies within universities and research centres.</p>
