      <h1>Crisis: Black Lightning Promo Includes Familiar Clues for CW Crossover</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T10:12:18+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Adams</a></address>
      <p>A new promo for the next episode of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-lightning-tv">Black Lightning</a> features clues for the "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" crossover event.</p>
      <p>The promo for "The Book Of Resistance: Chapter Four" focuses on China Anne McClain's Jennifer Pierce, who appears to be having issues with her growing powers. The first scene shows three different Jennifers: one in her Lightning costume, another in a Blackbird suit and the other in an all-white ensemble worn by prisoners of the ASA's Pit. As the skies above Freeland turn to red, Gambi tells Jefferson Pierce and Lynn Stewart that they're dealing with parallel universes.</p>

      <p>More scenes feature Jennifer battling her doppelgangers, Jefferson and Lynn arguing, white-clothed Jennifer being taken out of the Pierce household by ASA agents, and finally, Jennifer and Jefferson fighting one-on-one with their lightning powers.</p>
      <p>While "Crisis on Infinite Earths" will not have an episode dedicated to <a href="https://screenrant.com/crisis-infinite-earths-black-lightning-arrowverse-crossover-story/">Black Lightning</a>, this promo may reveal how the hero will be brought into the massive crossover. "Crisis on Infinite Earths" marks the first Arrowverse crossover to include <i>Black Lightning</i>, with Cress Williams reprising his role in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-black-lightning-arrowverse-appearence/">hours three and five</a>, according to the crossover event's showrunner and executive producer, Marc Guggenheim.</p>
      <p>Guggenheim previously revealed that Black Lightning's inclusion was a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/black-lightning-late-crisis-on-infinite-earths/">late decision</a> for "Crisis" due to the distance between the crossover's filming location in Vancouver and the <i>Black Lightning</i> series filming location in Atlanta. However, the writing team on <i>Black Lightning</i> was able to reduce Williams' role in several episodes to accommodate his appearance in "Crisis."</p>
