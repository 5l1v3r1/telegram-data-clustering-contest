      <h1>Oceans Are Running Out of Oxygen Due to Climate Change</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:28:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>The world’s oceans—and their inhabitants—are being choked to death by <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/report-climate-change-is-making-us-sick-1810472/">climate change</a> and nutrient pollution.</p>
      <p>Ocean oxygen loss, <a href="https://www.iucn.org/news/marine-and-polar/201912/marine-life-fisheries-increasingly-threatened-ocean-loses-oxygen-iucn-report">according to a new report</a> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is a growing menace to fisheries and species like tuna, marlin, and sharks.</p>
      <p>Titled “Ocean deoxygenation: Everyone’s problem,” the peer-reviewed study highlights causes of, impacts to, and solutions for marine suffocation.</p>
      <p>Ocean regions with low oxygen concentrations are expanding, IUCN warned, citing some 700 sites worldwide now affected by poor conditions—up from 45 in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>Over the same six-decade period, the volume of anoxic waters—areas completely depleted of oxygen—in the global ocean has quadrupled.</p>
      <p>“As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray,” IUCN Acting Director General Grethel Aguilar said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The adverse process favors low-oxygen-tolerant species (microbes, jellyfish, some squid) at the expense of low-oxygen-sensitives ones (many marine species, most fish).</p>
      <p>Particularly susceptible to low oxygen (because of their large size and high energy demands), tuna, marlin, and sharks are being driven into increasingly shallow surface layers of oxygen-rich water, making them vulnerable to overfishing.</p>
      <p>“Ocean oxygen depletion is menacing marine ecosystems already under stress from ocean warming and acidification,” study co-editor Dan Laffoley, senior advisor of marine science and conservation in IUCN’s Global Marine and Polar Program, explained.</p>
      <p>“To stop the worrying expansion of oxygen-poor areas,” he continued, “we need to decisively curb greenhouse gas emissions as well as nutrient pollution from agriculture and other sources.”</p>
      <p>Very low ocean oxygen can also affect basic processes like the cycling of elements including nitrogen and phosphorous, which are crucial for life on <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/climate-change-marches-emperor-penguins-toward-death-1809790/">Earth</a>, the report warned.</p>
      <p>Under a business-as-usual model, the ocean is expected to lose 3 to 4 percent of its global oxygen inventory by 2100.</p>
      <p>But while a single-digit decrease may not seem dire, that average masks more severe local changes.</p>
      <p>“Urgent global action to overcome and reverse the effects of ocean deoxygenation is needed,” IUCN Global Marine and Polar Program Director Minna Epps said.</p>
      <p>“Decisions taken at the ongoing [2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid] will determine whether our ocean continues to sustain a rich variety of life, or whether habitable, oxygen-rich marine areas are increasingly, progressively, and irrevocably lost,” Epps added.</p>
