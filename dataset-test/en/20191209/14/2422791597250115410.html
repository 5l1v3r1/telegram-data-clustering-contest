      <p>TORONTO -- An influential proxy advisory service is recommending shareholders vote against a takeover offer for Hudson's Bay Co. by a group led by the retailer's executive chairman.</p>
      <p>Institutional Shareholder Services raised concerns about the disclosures surrounding the $10.30 per share offer by a group led by HBC executive chairman Richard Baker.</p>
      <p>A rival offer of $11 per share made by Catalyst Capital Group has been rejected by HBC's special committee because it says the Baker-led group, which holds a 57 per cent stake in the retailer, is not interested in selling its shares.</p>
      <p>ISS raised questions about the thoroughness of the sale process and if the agreed transaction maximizes value for minority HBC shareholders.</p>
      <p>"Given that significant defects have been identified with the sale process, shareholders cannot be confident they are receiving maximal available value for their shares," ISS said in its report.</p>
      <p>The proxy advisory firm said the "only defect" of the rival offer identified by HBC's special committee was the opposition of the Baker-led group of continuing shareholders.</p>
      <p>However, the special committee at HBC said Monday the ISS report is flawed and urged shareholders to support the offer by the Baker-led group. It pointed to an acknowledgment by ISS that there is meaningful downside risk if shareholders don't approve the deal.</p>
      <p>"The $10.30 per share offer is the only offer available to minority shareholders and provides immediate and certain value at a significant market premium," said David Leith, chairman of HBC's special committee.</p>
      <p>"We continue to strongly recommend that HBC shareholders vote for the take-private transaction."</p>
      <p>Catalyst has asked a regulator to block the privatization bid or, at least, require HBC to amend its information circular. The Ontario Securities Commission is scheduled to hear that matter on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Catalyst has been working to protect the interests of the minority shareholders, including offering all shareholders a superior proposal to the Baker Group," said Gabriel de Alba, managing director and partner of Catalyst.</p>
      <p>"We will continue to push the HBC independent directors to finally step up and do their duty to protect shareholders, run a true value maximization process and restrict the coercive and questionable efforts of Richard Baker."</p>
