      <p>Shares of <b>Home Depot</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hd-stock-quote/"><b><u>HD</u></b></a>) are finally beginning to find some support after a post-earnings pummeling. HD stock shed some 25 points, or over 10%, before finally finding some footing over the past few days. Some of the drop was warranted given a lowered outlook by the company. The selling has now gotten overdone, however. Time to be a buyer of Home Depot stock near current levels.</p>

      <p>A lukewarm earnings report was the impetus behind the recent weakness. Home Depot <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/home-depot-earnings-q3-2019.html">reported on Nov. 19</a> with revenues coming in shy of analysts expectations. Sales checked in at $27.22 billion compared to expectations of $27.53 billion. The company lowered same stores sales growth to 3.5% from a previous 4%.</p>
      <p>Earnings, however, came pretty much in-line at $2.53 versus $2.52 consensus. Home Depot also reaffirmed the earnings outlook. Both the average customer ticket and sales per square foot improved from a year earlier. Overall not great, but not worth a 10% drop in the stock price.</p>
      <h3>HD Stock Moving Forward</h3>

      <p>The drop in the stock price combined with no change in earnings means Home Depot stock is looking comparatively attractive on a valuation basis. Price to earnings (P/E) are now under 22 and at a discount to the 5-year average of 23. The P/E ratio for HD is also trading at a discount to the <b>S&amp;P 500</b> for the first time in the past 10 years. Normally this metric had carried a premium over the last decade.</p>

      <p>HD stock is improving from a technical take. MACD is turning higher after reaching the lowest reading over the past year. 9-day RSI is firming up after printing at oversold levels. Bollinger Percent B is back in positive territory after being at the deepest negative levels over the prior 12 months. The detrended price oscillator is similarly looking steadier after a deep drop. Momentum has improved and looks to have bottomed out.</p>
      <p>HD stock is trading at a deep discount to the 20-day moving average at $224.21. Previous times that Home Depot stock was at a deep discount led to rallies back towards the 20-day moving average. There is major horizontal support at the $210 area.</p>
      <p>The dividend yield now stands at very healthy 2.5%, which is above the 5-year average of 2.1% for HD stock and also above the 1.82% yield of the S&amp;P 500. The dividend payout ratio for Home Depot is well below 60%, which means the dividend is very safe. Income-oriented investors will likely begin to look at HD near current prices. This should help to put a floor in HD stock.</p>
      <h3>Trading Home Depot Stock</h3>
      <p>Stock traders should look to be buyers of Home Depot stock on any further weakness. An initial upside price target would be the 20-day moving average level near $224. A meaningful break of the $210 support area can serve as a stop. Selling a March $220 covered call versus the shares would bring in an additional $7 in option premium to further reduce the initial risk while positioning to be a seller on strength.</p>
      <p>Option traders may want to position bullishly with a call calendar spread. The January $220/December $220 call calendar is priced at $1.90.  Maximum risk is $190 per spread. Ideally HD closes near the $220 level at December expiration. The trade structure allows for additional selling of weekly call options to further hedge the risk.</p>
