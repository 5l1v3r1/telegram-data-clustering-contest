        <b>A Preston woman is hosting a raffle with more than £1,300 worth of prizes in aid of the Lostock Hall hospice that cares for her dad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tricia Hall decided to raise money for St Catherine's Hospice in Lostock Lane after becoming a full-time carer to her 90-year-old parents, who have both suffered a stroke.</p>
      <p>The charity began giving her dad 24-hour high-level care at home in November last year, as well as helping Tricia, her mum and their own carers.</p>
      <p>This will be Tricia's last raffle of the year for the charity and prizes include Pandora jewellery, a Marc Jacobs Daisy gift set, a family photo shoot and a pair of Virgin train tickets.</p>
      <p>The cost per ticket is £5.</p>
      <p>For payment details, contact Tricia by searching for Fundraising for St Catherine's Hospice Lostock Hall on Facebook.</p>
