      <h1>Cyclone alert lifted for French island of Mayotte</h1>

      <p>The French Indian Ocean island of Mayotte was bracing for a major cyclone on Sunday, as authorities urged inhabitants to stock up on water. Cyclone Belna was expected to make landfall at about 7 p.m. local time (4 p.m. GMT).<br/><br/>Government representative Jean-Francois Colombet said the EU outermost region of 256,000 inhabitants was at risk of "very serious consequences" and that authorities had begun making sure the most at-risk inhabitants were indoors and evacuating the most exposed areas of the island.<br/><br/>But at the last minute, the storm veered off south and missed Mayotte, governor Jean-Francois Colombet said.<br/><br/>The cyclone is now 100 kilometres (60 miles) away from the island, but officials have told residents to be cautious nonetheless.</p>
      <p>This is the third major cyclone to hit the island in 50 years, according to Colombet. The government has closed the airport and most roads.<br/><br/>Mayotte is an overseas department of France, having voted against independence in a 1974 referendum that saw nearby Comoros become a sovereign state.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Scientists warned in November that global climate breakdown is "supercharging" the Indian Ocean climate system, and extreme weather events are only going to become more common.<br/><br/>Neighbouring Comoros and Madagascar islands are now in the path Belna, with both countries issuing cyclone alerts and expecting the storm's effects on Monday.</p>
