      <p>An iconic Cork restaurant was one of a record 23 food outlets forced to close in November over hygiene concerns.</p>
      <p>Tony's Bistro, on North Main St in Cork, was ordered to close after an inspection found that food was being prepared and stored in dirty and unhygienic rooms.</p>
      <p>Dirt and grease were found on walls, equipment and floors, the ceiling of the main kitchen was yellow with grease and grease was running down the walls.</p>
      <p>“Heavy deposits of grease” were also found on cooking equipment.</p>
      <p>The restaurant's lack of hygiene may attract pests and risked contaminating food, an inspector from the Health Service Executive (HSE) found.</p>
      <p>The closure order was served on November 28, but it was lifted the following day after the restaurant quickly remedied the report's complaints.</p>
      <p>A dead rodent was found in the dry goods store of Sajna Exclusive Dining on Bishop Street in Cobh, Co. Cork. The restaurant was closed from November 19 – 23.</p>
      <p>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) served a record 21 Closure Orders and two Prohibition Orders on food businesses for breaches of food safety legislation - the highest number of Enforcement Orders in one month since the legislation was introduced in 1998.</p>
      <p>Evidence of rats, a dead mouse trapped in a kitchen, mouse droppings in a bar and pigeon faeces in a food packing area were some of the problems found in restaurants throughout the country.</p>
      <p>A live rodent was seen running towards the food storage and equipment washing area, evidence of cockroaches was found in a kitchen and raw chicken and raw chicken juices were directly contaminating ready-to-eat foods.</p>
      <p>High levels of E. coli and coliforms were found in drinking water and ice samples taken from one premises and raw sewage was found on the floor of a customer toilet.</p>
      <p>Some of the premises inspected in November remain closed.</p>
      <p>Dr Pamela Byrne, Chief Executive of the FSAI condemned the record number of food businesses issued with Enforcement Orders in one month.</p>
      <p>She said: “November had the highest amount of Enforcement Orders in the one calendar month which the FSAI has seen since the legislation was introduced in 1998.</p>
      <blockquote>23 Enforcement Orders over a one-month period is totally unacceptable. The presence of rodents and other pests presents a grave and immediate danger to consumers’ health and food businesses must put in place more robust pest control systems</blockquote>
      <p>“With the Christmas period already underway, food businesses must ensure they maintain high food safety standards and I hope in December we see a significant reduction in Enforcement Orders and improving food safety standards.”</p>
