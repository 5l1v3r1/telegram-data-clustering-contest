      <p>Last time on <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/12/buy-drive-burn-american-two-doors-for-a-new-century/">Buy/Drive/Burn</a>, we took a look at three two-door, mid-market offerings from American brands for the 2001 model year. Most people hated such a Sophie’s Choice.</p>
      <p>Perhaps things will be a bit better today, as we cover the same market segment with offerings from Japan.</p>

        <b>Toyota Camry Solara</b>

      <p>Toyota brought back a two-door Camry for the 1999 model year, though it was not in the format some buyers expected. Instead of a standard Camry with two fewer doors, Toyota presented a sporty take on the idea and added the new Solara moniker. Underneath, Solara was based on the prior-generation Camry and built in Ontario. Camry engines of 2.2 to 3.0 liters were used, with five-speed manual or (mostly) four-speed automatics on hand for shift duty. A 2001 facelift revised the grille, tail lamps, and headlamps, and brought different wood. The base engine from 2001 was upgraded to the 2.4-liter mill from the Camry. Today’s selection is a base model 2.4L with a five-speed manual.</p>

        <b>Mitsubishi Eclipse</b>

      <p>A new third-generation Eclipse debuted for the 2000 model year, and boy was it a big deal at the time. With sporty, plastic-clad and slab-sided styling, the Eclipse said <i>New Millennium</i> in a big way. Riding on the Chrysler ST-22 platform with the Sebring coupe we saw last week, the Eclipse was powered by 2.4- or 3.0-liter engines, with four-speed automatics or five-speed manual transmissions. There were seven trim levels of Eclipse, and the most basic one was the RS. Today’s choice, it came with the 2.4-liter SOHC Mitsubishi engine and the manual transmission.</p>

        <b>Honda Accord Coupe</b>

      <p>Nothing was particularly revolutionary or unexpected about the sixth-generation Accord, even in slightly more rakish Coupe guise. Introduced for the 1998 model year, it was nearing replacement in 2001, though the generation broke SOPs and carried on five model years. In late 2000 Honda revised North American Accords with new front fascias, side skirts, bumpers, tail lamps, and wheels. Trims in 2001 were four for the Coupe, and included two levels (four- and six-cylinder) of LX and EX. Today we’ll have an LX with the 2.3-liter inline-four and five speed manual.</p>
      <p>Look at all these manual transmissions! Which midsize Japanese two-door gets your cash in 2001?</p>
