      <p><b>Tom Leighton:</b> “Good player but another one at 29 years old who would be surplus should you get up. Bowen is the one, he can play PL and has many years in front of him. Surely if you’ve got £15m to spend on Gayle you could get him for that given he’s leaving for free in 6 months time.”</p>
      <p><b>NottinghamRed99:</b> “Lyle Taylor being one of those injured players... Turns 30 in a few months. Won't be worth the fee that Charlton ask for.”</p>
      <p><b>Kieran:</b> “Charlton main player they could ask for a decent fee but they are not in a position to do that so couple million would do them good with the injuries they have.”</p>
