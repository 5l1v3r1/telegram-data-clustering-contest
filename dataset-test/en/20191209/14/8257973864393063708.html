      <h1>Russia, Ukraine leaders agree on cease-fire, prisoner exchange by year's end</h1>

      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Volodymyr-Zelensky/?tps=1">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> agreed to a cease-fire Monday, moving the two countries closer to ending a standoff in the Donbas region.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/JonahFisherBBC/status/1204166469455634432?s=20">The agreement</a>, brokered by France and Germany in Paris' Elyess Palace, states that Russia and Ukraine are committed to a "full and comprehensive implementation of the ceasefire" and the exchange of conflict-related detainees by year's end.</p>
      <p>"We have said once again how important it is to have a dialogue between parties," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-zelensky-merkel-join-macron-in-paris-for-talks-to-end-ukraines-war/2019/12/09/285cc8b0-17ae-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html">Putin said</a>.</p>
      <p>Zelensky called it "a big step toward peace."</p>
      <p>The four sides are to meet again in four months to discuss conditions for elections in eastern Ukraine, a sticky issue for both sides, but Zelensky <a href="https://www.voanews.com/europe/russia-ukraine-leaders-agree-ceasefire-following-four-way-talks-paris">said he</a> is confident the meeting will be held and they will all be in a position to "go forward and address other questions on the basis of our achievements."</p>
      <p>The talks were aimed at edging the two sides closer to ending a conflict that broke out in 2014 in eastern Ukraine that has cost the lives of some 13,000 people.</p>
      <p>Though not a major breakthrough, the countries made "practical, tangible progress," French President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Emmanuel-Macron/?tps=1">Emmanuel Macron</a> said.</p>
      <p>"We haven't found the magic wand, but we have relaunched talks," he said.</p>
      <p>For Zelensky, who has found himself intertwined in the impeachment inquiry of U.S. President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a>, the meeting was a chance to achieve a campaign promise to bring peace to eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Putin may have already scored an early victory by getting Zelensky to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50672006">agree to pull back</a> from three areas along the front line as a condition to start the talks, a concession that angered some supporters.</p>
      <p>Zelensky said before the meeting <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/zelensky-hopes-for-concrete-results-from-normandy-format-talks.html">he wanted</a> "tangible" results, such as the release of Ukrainian prisoners and enforcing a cease-fire in the Donbas region.</p>
      <p>"Since 2016 there was no dialogue, which means there was no opportunity to talk about ending the war," he said.</p>
      <p>There were some demonstrators on the street outside Elysee Palace involving protesters who opposed Putin's visit.</p>
