      <p>Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Zozibini Tunzi of South Africa was crowned Miss Universe 2019 with Miss Puerto Rico Madison Anderson and Miss Mexico Sofia Aragon as the runner-ups.</p>
      <p>Tunzi, who beat out 89 contestants in total on Sunday, was emotional <a href="https://twitter.com/MissUniverse/status/1203872106125156354">after winning</a> and smiled as she received her crown.</p>
      <p>"I think the most important thing we should be teaching young girls today is leadership," <a href="https://twitter.com/MissUniverse/status/1203866840549773314">Tunzi said</a> before winners were announced.</p>
      <p>"It's something that has been lacking in young girls and women for a very long time, not because we don't want to but because of what society has labeled women to be. I think we are the most powerful beings in the world and that we should be given every opportunity," she continued.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Steve-Harvey/?tps=1">Steve Harvey</a> hosted the event for the fifth year in a row and was once again a part of a mix-up onstage. The comedian infamously announced the <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2015/12/21/Steve-Harvey-crowns-wrong-winner-of-Miss-Universe/2141450702085/">wrong winner</a> of the pageant in 2015.</p>
      <p>Harvey, this year, announced that Miss Philippines Gazini Ganados was the winner of the National Costume competition while Miss Malaysia Shweta Sekhon was onstage in full-costume to accept the award.</p>
      <p>Sekhon got on the microphone to fix the mistake while Harvey stated that he was just reading the teleprompter. "Y'all gotta quit doing this to me. I can read. They are trying to fix it now, but this is what they did to me back in 2015," <a href="https://www.etonline.com/miss-universe-pageant-says-steve-harvey-did-not-mix-up-national-costume-winner-in-shocking">he said</a>.</p>
      <p>The official Twitter account for Miss Universe <a href="https://twitter.com/MissUniverse/status/1203912109861543936">later announced</a> that Harvey and the teleprompter were correct, stating that Ganados had in fact won the National Costume competition.</p>
