        <b>Residents of Matanya village, Nanyuki, Laikipia County were left in a state of bewilderment following a bizarre incident on Monday, December 9.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A huge piece of glass moulded in the shape of a canopy with bits of electrical wiring attached fell from the sky.</p>
      <p>According to a report by <i>Citizen Digital</i>, the stunned residents convened at the scene but before they could touch the foreign object,<a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45601-kdfs-most-lethal-war-planes-unleashing-terror-alshabaab-photos"> Kenya Airforce soldiers</a> arrived on a pick-up truck mounted with a high caliber machine gun.</p>
      <p>Clad in their camouflage gear and balaclavas, the military officials from the Rapid Deployment Squadron (RDS) unit, quickly took possession of the object -which they identified as a <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45601-kdfs-most-lethal-war-planes-unleashing-terror-alshabaab-photos">rear canopy of one of their fighter jets.</a></p>

      <p>A dive into the world of fighter jet pilots revealed that such instances happen quite often, especially during drills whereby the <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45218-female-kdf-pilots-who-rule-skies-video">pilot simulates a scenario</a> in which he is forced to bail out of the jet.</p>
      <p>"Yes, the canopy is the first thing that comes off once a pilot pulls the loop handle on the seat at knee level," a source from the KDF who spoke to <a href="http://kenyans.co.ke/">Kenyans.co.ke</a> on condition of anonymity, disclosed.</p>
      <p>He went on to explain that pulling the emergency bail out handle fires the ejection gun for 0.2 seconds, starting the ejection at 50-55 feet per second. </p>
      <p>Simultaneously the aircraft’s glass canopy either shatters, is blown off, or the seat breaks through it, depending on the aircraft model.  </p>
      <p>Straps tighten around the pilots' arms and legs and an emergency oxygen supply is released. Then a drogue parachute at the back of the 214-pound seat opens. At the same time two small panels about 16 inches long and 8 inches wide open up on either side of the seat to keep it straight. And all of this happens in 1.35 seconds.</p>
      <p>The ejectee suffers from 18 Gs (gravitional force) - that is about 20 times your bodyweight pushing down on you, an enormous amount of force that would cause anyone to pass out if it were sustained. </p>
      <p>Details of the condition of the pilot responsible for the ejected canopy were not immediately available at the time of going to press. </p>
