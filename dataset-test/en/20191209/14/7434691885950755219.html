      <h1>Toronto Film Critics Association names Parasite the year's best movie</h1>
      <h2>The Body Remembers When The World Broke Open, Antigone and Firecrackers are nominated for the best Canadian film prize</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:55:48+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author">Radheyan Simonpillai</a></address>
      <p>The Toronto Film Critics Association (TFCA) is high on Bong Joon-Ho’s <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/parasite-movie-review-bong-joon-ho/">Parasite</a>, voting the absurd dark comedy about class warfare Best Picture and Best Foreign-Language Film.</p>
      <p>The organization, which counts the NOW film team as members, also announced the nominees for the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award. Sophie Deraspe’s French-Canadian immigrant fable <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/tiff2019/tiff-review-antigone-sophie-deraspe/">Antigone</a> (now playing), Jasmin Mozaffari’s gritty and stylish small town drama <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/firecrackers-jasmin-mozaffari/">Firecrackers</a> and Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers and Kathleen Hepburn’s spare but powerful look drama about a chance meeting between two Indigenous women, <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/tiff-2019-body-remembers-when-the-world/">The Body Remembers When The World Broke Open</a> (opens Friday), will compete for the $100,000 prize.</p>
      <p>Parasite filmmaker Bong also creeped into the winner's circle to claim the Best Director award, leaving Martin Scorsese and Noah Baumbach as runner-ups. Scorsese’s mob epic <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/the-irishman-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-joe-pesci/">The Irishman</a> and Baumbach’s <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/marriage-story-noah-baumbach-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson/">Marriage Story</a> were runner-ups in the Best Picture category as well. Both films triumphed elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Marriage Story landed two acting prizes. Adam Driver was named Best Actor for his devastating performance as a theatre director going through a divorce. Laura Dern, who plays a divorce lawyer, took home the Best Supporting Actress prize. Both Driver and Dern triumphed over <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/tiff2019/tiff-review-uncut-gems/">Uncut Gem</a>s stars Adam Sandler and Julia Fox – the runner-ups in those respective categories – who play lovers in the high-anxiety thriller.</p>
      <p>The Irishman eeked out a win in the Best Screenplay category. Screenwriter Steven Zallian’s simple but powerful words (“It is what it is”) triumphed over the verbose, show-stopping speeches in Marriage Story.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/golden-globes-2020-nominations-netflix/">the Golden Globes failed to nominate Lupita Nyong’o</a> for her performance in <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/jordan-peele-us/">Jordan Peele's Us</a>, the TFCA recognized her in the Best Actress category. Brad Pitt won Best Supporting Actor for his role in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood, edging out Joe Pesci’s low-key performance in The Irishman.</p>
      <p>In a win for white feminism and performative woke-sterism, the TFCA gave their Best First Feature prize to <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/booksmart-beanie-feldstein-kaitlyn-dever-olivia-wilde/">Olivia Wilde's comedy-of-age Booksmart</a>. That film triumphed over <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/atlantics-review-mati-diop-netflix/">Atlantics</a>, Mati Diop's tremendous debut feature about Senegelese women haunted by lost men. Melina Matsoukas's <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/queen-and-slim-melina-matsoukas-daniel-kaluuya/">Queen &amp; Slim</a> was also a runner-up</p>
      <p>The Best Animated Feature award went to stop-motion animation studio Laika’s <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/missing-link-chris-butler/">Missing Link</a>, while the Allan King Documentary Film Award went to Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert's <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/hot-docs-american-factory-julia-reichert/">American Factory</a>.</p>
      <p>In a previous announcement, the TFCA named TIFF’s outgoing Executive Director Michèle Maheux the recipient of the Clyde Gilmour Award. The prize comes with Technicolor services valued at $50,000 for a filmmaker chosen by the honouree. Maheux chose to reward Toronto filmmaker Lina Rodriguez who is behind domestic Colombian dramas like Senoritas and <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/this-time-tomorrow-builds-big-drama-out-of-small-domestic-ro/">This Time Tomorrow</a>.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez will receive that prize at the association's January 9 gala where the winners for Best Canadian Film and the Jay Scott Prize for an Emerging artist will also be announced.</p>
