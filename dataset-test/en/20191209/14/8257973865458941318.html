      <p>Beyoncé discussed the collection in an<a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a30151094/beyonce-elleuk-january-2020/"> interview</a> with Elle U.K. published Monday. She said her Ivy Park x Adidas collection will be a gender-neutral line that embraces creativity.</p>
      <p>"It incorporates my personal style and expands that to include something for everyone," Beyoncé said. "I love experimenting with fashion, mixing high and low, sportswear with couture, even masculine and feminine. This new line is fun and lends itself to creativity, the ultimate power."</p>
      <p>"I focused on designing a unisex collection of footwear and apparel because I saw so many men in Ivy Park. The way they have embraced the brand is an unexpected gift," she added. "I appreciate the beauty of gender-neutral clothing and breaking the so-called fashion rules."</p>
