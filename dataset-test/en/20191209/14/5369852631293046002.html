      <p>SAIF RUBIE, THE agent of former Liverpool forward Bobby Duncan, has been banned by the Football Association (FA) from acting as an intermediary for six weeks and fined £10,000 (€11,800) for messages posted on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Duncan completed a permanent move to Fiorentina on 2 September following a turbulent few days that saw Rubie take to social media to accuse Liverpool of attempting to block a transfer.</p>
      <p>Rubie singled out Reds sporting director Michael Edwards for criticism and alleged the treatment of the 18-year-old – who is Steven Gerrard’s cousin – showed “zero consideration” for the player’s mental health.</p>
      <p>Liverpool described the allegations as “inaccurate” and “inflammatory”, while club legend Jamie Carragher and supporters rounded on Rubie, who later deleted his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>The FA has now taken action against the agent by suspending him from 4 December until 15 January, handing him a hefty fine and sending him on an Educational Programme for improper use of social media.</p>
      <p>Rubie has been accused on bringing the game into disrepute with his social media messages, although the FA has not specified which posts the punishment is for.</p>
