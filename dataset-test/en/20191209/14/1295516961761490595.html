      <p>Cloud Chamber is located in California and will be working with its twin studio in Montreal, Quebec to develop the new <i>BioShock</i> game. Global Studio Head Kelley Gilmore will lead Cloud Chamber's team in California while Ken Schachter will be the Studio Manager in Montréal.</p>
      <p>The first <i>BioShock</i>, which debuted in 2007 on the Xbox 360, was met with critical and commercial acclaim for its immersive storytelling, a unique underwater dystopian 1960's setting and inventive gameplay. The franchise would see a sequel in 2010, followed by the last game in the franchise, <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/bioshock-infinite/">BioShock Infinite</a></i>, which released in 2013. The original developers, Irrational Games, was shut down soon after, leaving many to question whether the franchise had a future.</p>
      <p>The <i>BioShock</i> series even garnered enough attention to bring discussions of a film adaptation to the table, but nothing was set in stone. The series has been absent for the entirety of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One console generation, so it's no surprise fans are eager to get back in the water.</p>
