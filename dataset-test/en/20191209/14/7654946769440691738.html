      <p>Accused madam Ghislaine Maxwell is the latest in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal planning a major TV interview — in part to defend her disgraced pal Prince Andrew, according to a report Monday.</p>
      <p>The British media heiress, who has been repeatedly accused of procuring young girls for her pedophile ex, may already be in talks with a major US network, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10509700/ghislaine-maxwell-tell-all-interview-prince-andrew/">according to The Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>A TV special would follow the Duke of York’s own <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/just-6-of-the-public-believes-prince-andrew-poll/">disastrous BBC sit-down</a> about his close ties to Epstein, as well as the tearful accusations key accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/02/sex-with-prince-andrew-was-quick-and-disgusting-virginia-roberts-giuffre/">made in an hourlong special</a> for the same UK broadcaster.</p>
      <p>“Ghislaine is in hiding and knows the only way to stop being hunted is to speak on her own terms,” a source told the paper.</p>
      <p>“She will do a sit-down interview with a big US network and defend the duke. Apparently, she’ll say Virginia Giuffre is lying and Andrew never had sex with her,” the source told the UK paper.</p>
      <p>Maxwell, 57, is understood to be at the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/12/feds-might-be-targeting-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell/">heart of the FBI’s ongoing probe</a> into Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring since his death in August. She has not been seen in public since he was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/08/epstein-charged-with-abusing-dozens-of-minors-in-massive-sex-trafficking-case/">arrested on federal charges</a> in July.</p>
      <p>She is also central to the case against Andrew, with Giuffre claiming the socialite was the one who first made her have sex with the royal at Maxwell’s London home in 2001.</p>
      <p>Giuffre recently tweeted for “all eyes” to look out for the woman she says should be “<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/04/virginia-roberts-giuffre-wants-ghislaine-maxwell-to-rot-in-jail/">rotting in jail for her atrocities</a> against me &amp; so many other little girls she dragged into Epstein’s orbit!”</p>
      <p>Both the prince and Maxwell — who have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/01/prince-andrew-in-constant-contact-with-epstein-ex-ghislaine-maxwell-report/">reportedly remained in contact </a>throughout the scandal — have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/18/prince-andrew-appalled-by-jeffrey-epstein-sex-abuse-claims/">denied any wrongdoing</a>.</p>
