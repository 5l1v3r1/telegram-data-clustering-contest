      <p>A man has been jailed for three years and six months after pleading guilty to 14 sexual offence charges.</p>
      <p>Thomas Inglis, 23, from Portland Road in Hucknall was sentenced on Wednesday, December 4 at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Nottingham Crown Court</a>.</p>
      <p>He has been ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life and was given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on October 10 by officers from the public protection department.</p>
      <p>Officers from the neighbourhood search unit seized a number of items including a written note, an iPhone and a laptop.</p>
      <p>The charges were:</p>
      <p>⦁ Attempting to arrange / facilitate the commission of a child sex offence (1 count)</p>
      <p>⦁ Distributing an indecent photograph of a child (3 counts)</p>
      <p>⦁ Attempting to cause / incite a boy to engage in sexual activity (1 count)</p>
      <p>⦁ Attempting to cause / incite a girl to engage in sexual activity (1 count)</p>
      <p>⦁ Attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity (3 counts)</p>
      <p>⦁ Making indecent images (3 counts)</p>
      <p>⦁ Possession of prohibited images (1 count)</p>
      <p>⦁ Possession of extreme images (1 count)</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Darren Mee from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police </a>said: "I'd like to thank all officers who worked hard on this case, it's meant that Inglis is now behind bars.</p>
      <p>"This sentence shows that officers across Nottinghamshire will use a variety of tactics to identify and bring to justice those who seek to abuse children.</p>
      <p>"The message to those people is clear. The internet is not a lawless playground where they can seek to live out their illegal activities.</p>
      <p>"Police officers are working hard 24/7, online and offline, to identify and bring to justice sex offenders like Inglis, and above all to help keep children safe."</p>
