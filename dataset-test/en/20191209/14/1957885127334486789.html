      <h1>There's 10% off almost everything at eBay once again</h1>
      <h2>Switch for £250! PS4 Pro for £300! More!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:39:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:39</time> by <a rel="author">James Pickard</a></address>
      <p>It's a day of the week that ends with a 'Y' so you know what that means. Yep, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/">eBay</a> is back at it again with another voucher code. This one is pretty special, though, as you can use it to save 10 per cent off any purchase over £100 across the site.</p>
      <p>There are no retailer restrictions as with other eBay codes (at least from what I've seen when browsing) so you can find some terrific savings at stores such as <a href="http://www.ebaystores.co.uk/Argos">Argos</a>, <a href="http://www.ebaystores.co.uk/ao">AO</a>, <a href="http://www.ebaystores.co.uk/Currys-PC-World">Currys PC World</a>, <a href="http://www.ebaystores.co.uk/ebuyerexpressshop">Ebuyer</a>, <a href="http://www.ebaystores.co.uk/scancomputersinternational">Scan</a> and more. All you need to do is enter the code 'PROSPER10' at the checkout and you can save up to £50 off a single purchase.</p>
      <p>Now, we'd be here until the code expires trying to pick out absolutely everything that's best to buy using this latest voucher. Instead, I've listed a few highlights for you to peruse below. There are console bundles - including the Nintendo Switch - along with lots of other top tech savings:</p>
