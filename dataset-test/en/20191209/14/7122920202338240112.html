      <h1>Making Pixel more helpful with the first Pixel feature drop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:00:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shenaz Zack</a></address>
      <p>Your phone should get better over time. Your Pixel automatically updates regularly with fixes and improvements. Now, your Pixel will also get bigger updates in new Pixel feature drops.  Our first one, coming this month, includes a new way to capture portraits, easier Duo calls and automatic call screening. </p>
      <h3>More photo controls</h3>
      <p>Now, you can turn a photo into a portrait on Pixel by blurring the background post-snap. So whether you took the photo years ago, or you forgot to turn on portrait mode, you can easily give each picture an artistic look with Portrait Blur in Google Photos. </p>

      <h3>Put an end to robocalls</h3>
      <p>With our latest update to <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">Call Screen</a> on Pixel 4 in the US, the Google Assistant now helps you automatically screen unknown callers and filter out detected robocalls before your phone ever rings, so you’re not interrupted by them. And when it’s not a robocall, your phone rings a few moments later with helpful context about who is calling and why. Call Screen works on your device and does not use Wi-Fi or data, which makes the screening fast and the content private to you.</p>

      <h3>Improved video calls on Duo </h3>
      <p>Video calls are better on Pixel 4 with new Duo features that let you focus on conversations instead of logistics. Auto-framing keeps your face centered during your Duo video calls, even as you move around, thanks to Pixel 4’s wide-angle lens. And if another person joins you in the shot, the camera automatically adjusts to keep both of you in the frame.</p>

      <p>Now, the playback on your Duo calls is even smoother, too. When a bad connection leads to spotty audio, a machine learning model on your Pixel 4 predicts the likely next sound and helps you to keep the conversation going with minimum disruptions. Pixel 4’s Smooth Display also reduces choppiness on your video feed, refreshing up to 90 times a second.</p>
      <p>When you make Duo video calls on Pixel 2, 3 and 4, you can now apply a portrait filter as well. You’ll look sharper against the gentle blur of your background, while the busy office or messy bedroom behind you goes out of focus.</p>

      <h3>More helpful features for more Pixels</h3>
      <p>In addition to new features for Pixel 4, we’re also bringing new apps and features to Pixel 2, 3 and 3a:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/on-device-ai-with-pixel4/">Recorder</a> app is now available on older generations of Pixel.</li>
        <li>Pixel 3 and 3a users will get <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/live-caption/">Live Caption.</a> </li>
        <li>Digital Wellbeing is getting updates too. <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-focus-mode/">Focus mode</a> is rolling out to help you stay productive and minimize distractions by pausing apps you've selected in a single tap. You can now set an automatic schedule, take a short break or end Focus mode early without disrupting your schedule.</li>
        <li>Flip to Shhh will also join the Digital Wellbeing features on Pixel 2 and 2XL.</li>
        <li>If you use a Pixel 4 in the UK, Canada, Ireland, Singapore and Australia, you’ll soon get the <a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/9475056?hl=en">new Google Assistant</a> (English only), which is even faster and more helpful.</li>
        <li>With the latest update to Pixel 4, you'll also get amazingly fast accuracy in Google Maps with improved on-device computing for much better location quality. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A more efficient phone</h3>
      <p>In addition to these new experiences, all Pixel devices will also receive an update to its memory management in the feature drop. With this new enhancement, your phone proactively compresses cached applications so that users can run multiple applications at the same time -- like games, streaming content and more.</p>
      <p>Pixel phones have always received monthly updates to improve performance and make your device safe. Now, feature drops will bring more helpful and fun features to users on a regular basis to continue to make your Pixel better than ever. </p>
      <p>These features are already rolling out, and will hit Pixel devices in the coming weeks. To get the new features, update to the latest version of Android and go to the Play Store to start downloading your updated apps.</p>
