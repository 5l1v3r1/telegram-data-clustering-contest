      <p>In Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day today, it is also <a href="https://geni.us/6KEZ">discounting</a> the Dash Air Fryer. It is now just $69.99, saving you $30 off of its regular price. This does bring it back down to its all-time lowest price. Making it a great time to pick one up.</p>
      <p>As part of the Gold Box Deal of the Day, this price will only be on sale today, and will expire at midnight PST. So you're going to want to get before the end of the day, if you want it at $69.99.</p>

      <p>This particular model is a three-quart model. So it's not going to hold a ton of food, but there's enough space in there for a good amount of fries or chicken to have fried.</p>
      <p>There are also eight presets available on the Dash Air Fryer. So you can take the guess work out of your food prep. It'll always come out crispy and very tasty. And this all happens in less time than it takes to pre-heat your oven.</p>
      <p>With the Dash Air Fryer, you're going to get healthier food too. Since you're not frying it in a pot full of oil, you're taking all of that fat out of the equation here. In fact, takes out about 70-80% of the fat out of french fries and fried chicken. Now that is pretty impressive, if you ask me. This means that you can still have your favorite fried foods, without clogging your arteries with all of that oil. That's a win/win for everyone.</p>
