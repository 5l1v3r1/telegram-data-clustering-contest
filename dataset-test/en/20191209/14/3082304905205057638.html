        <b>WADA has banned Russia from sporting events after it was recommended RUSADA be declared non-compliant again, which the IOC supports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has reiterated its support for Russia’s four-year ban from major international sporting events imposed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</p>
      <p>WADA declared the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) non-compliant again at a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday over inconsistencies in anti-doping data discovered during an investigation.</p>
      <p>Athletes will not be able to compete under the Russian flag at the 2020 Olympics or the 2022 Winter Games, while Russia’s place at the World Cup in Qatar is also in jeopardy.</p>
      <p>The IOC had supported the recommended sanction last month and retained its stance following the announcement.</p>
      <p>“The representatives of the Olympic Movement today [Monday] supported this unanimous decision in the WADA Executive Committee, which is in line with the statement made by the IOC Executive Board [on November 26] and endorsed by the Olympic Summit,” a statement released to Omnisport read.</p>
      <p>The IOC said in November it would “support the toughest sanctions against all those responsible for this manipulation”.</p>
      <p>It added: “With regard to the sanctions following this manipulation, we will still have to evaluate these in detail.</p>
      <p>“The IOC emphasises that any sanctions should follow the rules of natural justice and respect human rights.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, the IOC stresses that the guilty should be punished in the toughest way possible because of the seriousness of this infringement and thus welcomes the sanctions for the Russian authorities responsible.”</p>
      <p>WADA’s statement on Monday said: “The WADA Executive Committee has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts.”</p>
