      <p>Tito Ortiz opened up to VladTV about UFC fighters doing events several times a year, which he explained has changed since he started out with only a few fights a year. Tito went on to state that fighters aren't making a lot of money now with UFC because they aren't able to make brands for themselves, adding that they're only building up the UFC brand as a whole.Â </p>
      <p>During the conversation, Tito also spoke about the big surgeries he's had over the years, and he joked that he's like a bionic man now. To hear more, including the UFC paying him and Chuck Liddell $150,000 each for their first fight, which made $35 million with pay-per-view, hit the above clip.</p>
