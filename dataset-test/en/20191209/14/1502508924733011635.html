      <p>The government has not issued any directions to central universities to hike fees, Union HRD Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ramesh-pokhriyal">Ramesh Pokhriyal </a>'Nishank' said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Nishank made the statement in response to a written question in the Lok Sabha.</p>
      <p>"The Ministry of Human Resource Development has not issued any instructions to Central Universities for increase in the fees," he said.</p>
      <p>The minister's comments came on the day JNU students were lathi-charged by police when they tried to march to the Rashtrapati Bhawan to demand a rollback in hostel fee hike.</p>
