      <p><a href="https://www.wionews.com/opinions/turkey-and-china-tie-themselves-in-knots-over-syria-and-xinjiang-257735">Turkey</a> has sent 11 French relatives of suspected "terrorist fighters" back home, the Turkish interior ministry said Monday, the latest in the country's renewed push to deport foreign jihadist insurgents.</p>
      <p>"Eleven French citizens have been deported to their home country," it said in a statement. </p>
      <p>A judicial source in France confirmed that four women and their seven children had arrived in France early on Monday.</p>
      <p>Under a 2014 accord between France and Turkey, Paris agreed to take back jihadists trying to return home from Syria via Turkey and incarcerate them at home.</p>
      <p>Two of the women returned Monday were already targeted by arrest warrants and will soon face a judge, while the other two were sought by police and have been placed in custody, the French source said.</p>
      <p>Another source close to the case said the women had escaped from a camp controlled by Kurdish forces in Syria before being captured by Turkish police.</p>
      <p>Ankara has sharply criticised Western countries for refusing to take back citizens who left home to join the <a href="https://www.wionews.com/west-asia/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-sri-lanka-bombings-212899">Islamic State group</a> (IS) in Syria and Iraq.</p>
      <p>It says it has around 1,200 foreign IS members in custody. </p>
      <p>The bulk of the foreign jihadists are being held in Syria itself, with thousands languishing in prisons and camps across the country's northeast.</p>
      <p>Turkey's interior ministry said last week that 59 "foreign terrorists" have been deported to their home countries since November 11, when it began a new push to expel them. </p>
      <p>Of them, 26 were sent back to the United States and Europe.</p>
      <p>"Turkey is no one's open-air prison or hotel," said ministry spokesman Ismail Catakli, adding that Turkish authorities would deport all of the suspects.</p>
