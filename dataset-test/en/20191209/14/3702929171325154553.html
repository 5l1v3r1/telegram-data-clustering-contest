      <p>WELLINGTON: New Zealand police said at least one person was killed and more fatalities were likely, after an island volcano popular with tourists erupted Monday, leaving dozens stranded.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm there is one fatality” said deputy commissioner John Tims. “There is a number still remaining on the island who are currently unaccounted for,” he added, “at this stage, it is too dangerous for police and rescue services to go to the island.”</p>
