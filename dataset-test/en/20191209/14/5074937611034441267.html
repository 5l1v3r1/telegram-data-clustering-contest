      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:36:47+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Appah Marfo, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Dec 9, GNA - Bishop Dr Yaw Owusu Ansah, Regional Overseer of Resurrection Power and Living Bread Ministries International (REPLIB), Accra West has advised members to take advantage of opportunities in God’s house in order to make an impact.</p>
      <p>He said the opportunity to play a role for God’s Kingdom was a rare one and attracted blessings.</p>
      <p>The Regional Overseer made the remarks during REPLIB Dansoman branch’s Annual Thanksgiving service.</p>
      <p>The event was dubbed, “How can I repay the Lord for all His goodness to me?— Psalm 116:12-14”</p>
      <p>Bishop Owusu Ansah quoted from the scriptures saying, “Now He who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed for sowing that is, your resources, and increase the harvest of your righteousness which shows itself in active goodness, kindness, and love.”</p>
      <p>“When you get the opportunity to do something in God’s house, don’t shun it. It’s God’s own special way of showcasing you to the world,” he stated.</p>
      <p>The Regional Overseer said God had given everyone seeds of potentials, which were not for consumption, but to plant and make good use of.</p>
      <p>“God is steadily watching what you would do with the seed, whether you would make something meaningful out of it or not.</p>
      <p>He never forgets your efforts and sacrifices in His house and He will surely reward you accordingly,” he added.</p>
