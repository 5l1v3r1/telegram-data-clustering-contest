      <h1>Stolen ECHO newspaper and plaque on Eleanor Rigby statue to be restored</h1>
      <h2>Parts of the iconic statue were stolen in October</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:42:23+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/alan-weston/" target="_blank">Alan Weston</a></address>
      <p>A much-loved statue in the city centre will soon be restored after being vandalised.</p>
      <p>There was dismay after key parts of the Eleanor Rigby statue were <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpools-eleanor-rigby-statue-vandalised-17113415">stolen in October</a> .</p>
      <p>The statue in Stanley Street consists of a bronze figure on a stone bench reading a newspaper with a shopping bag on her right and the bench is a popular spot for photographs to be taken.</p>

      <p>However earlier this year the bronze copy of the  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> , along with a sparrow perched on top of it, went missing.</p>
      <p>And the inscribed plaque behind the statue, which dedicates the work to the city, was also missing.</p>
      <p>The tribute was designed and made by Tommy Steele and stands as a tribute to the hit Beatles song of the same name, which tells the story of a lonely woman, Eleanor Rigby.</p>

      <p>The statue was erected in 1982 as a tribute to Fab Four and dedicated to "all the lonely people," after the classic 1966 Beatles song.</p>
      <p>The plaque behind the statue has been stolen previously and  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpools-eleanor-rigby-statue-plaque-10013397">this would not be the first time the iconic landmark has been vandalised.</a></p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-council">Liverpool City Council</a> said: "Three elements of the statue were removed in October – the book, bird and plaque - and we can confirm that we have all three elements ready to go back on the statue.</p>

      <p>" We are currently getting quotes from manufacturers to make a bracket to re-attach the book and the bird that sit on the bench next to the figure.</p>
      <p>"Once it has been made the repairs will be made and the plaque will also be reattached on the wall.</p>
      <p>We hope that this can be done as soon as possible."</p>
