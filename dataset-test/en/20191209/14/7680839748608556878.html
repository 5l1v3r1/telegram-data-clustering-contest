      <p>Russia has been banned from competing in international sports for four years after an investigation from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) was concluded.</p>
      <p>Russia was found guilty of manipulating laboratory data to mask banned substances in its athletes during a probe in January, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/50710598">the BBC reports.</a></p>
      <p>The ban means the country will be unable to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Toyko, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.</p>
      <p>The report says Russian athletes who can provide proof that they were unaffected by the doping scandal will be able to compete, however, under a neutral flag.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Lindacath/status/1203988005918248962">Wada vice-president Linda Helleland said on Twitter</a> that she believed the punishment was still “not enough” and that the organization “owe it to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible.”</p>
      <p>Russia has 21 days to appeal the ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).</p>
