      <p>Activists from the Extinction Rebellion group have called on ministers to end the practice of over-fishing in Irish waters.</p>
      <p>About 50 demonstrators gathered outside Leinster House on Monday.</p>
      <p>The protest is the latest in a series of “direct action” demonstrations by the environmental group, which held a week-long campaign of “civil disobedience” in October.</p>
      <p>Two of the demonstrators were dressed as mermaids with costumes made of seashells, recycled items and fishing nets while others dressed as fishermen.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion called on the government to uphold the law and end over-fishing.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the group said ending over-fishing by January 1 2020 is a legal requirement for members of the European Union.</p>
      <p>“The European Council’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was revised in 2013 to include a law to force member states to eliminate over-fishing by the start of next year.</p>
      <p>“Yet, on the eve of this deadline, the Irish Government appears to have no plans to end business as usual when it comes to over-fishing.</p>
      <p>“Overfishing at current levels takes a terrible toll on fish populations, marine life and on the ocean’s ability to sequester carbon, and thus help slow down global warming.</p>
      <p>“Ireland has continuously been identified as among the worst nations for negotiating fish catches above scientific advice on sustainable limits.”</p>

      <p>The group said inaction to ensure sustainable fishing levels to date has created a situation where significant cuts in fish quotas and even closure of fisheries must now be considered to meet the EU’s binding 2020 deadline to end overfishing.</p>
      <p>Padraig Fogarty, campaign officer with the Irish Wildlife Trust, said: “We’re trying to highlight the dire state of the ocean and over-fishing is something that has taken an enormous toll on marine life over the last decade.</p>
      <p>“We have a law now that states that it has to stop by the end of January and it does not look like we are anywhere near that deadline.</p>
      <p>“What we’re saying today is – enough is enough. The Minister for Agriculture and the Marine Michael Creed has to uphold the law.</p>
      <p>“Ireland has one of the worst records in the European Union for over-fishing.</p>
      <p>“We have a climate and bio-diversity emergency so it is vital the Government starts treating these issues seriously and that we stop over-fishing and restore the health of the oceans.”</p>
