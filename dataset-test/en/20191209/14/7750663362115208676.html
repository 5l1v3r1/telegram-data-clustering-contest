      <p>Both teams are still within a shout of qualifying for the knockout phases, with the home side <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/groups.html">on six points</a> and Atalanta on four.</p>

      <p>The Ukrainian champions head into this game in the box seat knowing that just a draw over Atalanta, along with Dinamo Zagreb failing to beat Manchester City, would guarantee their place in the knockouts.</p>
      <p>Unlike Atalanta, Shakhtar are not strangers to this competition and possess an impressive amount of pedigree - especially in home games.</p>
      <p>Their last outing, a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/man-city-vs-shakhtar-donetsk_game_96726.html">1-1 draw</a> with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a>'s side at the Etihad, was a demonstration of how these Shakhtar players can be competitive against any opponent in Europe.</p>
      <p>For some time, Shakhtar have successfully pursued a transfer policy that places strong emphasis on signing Brazilian players, with five included in the starting XI against City.</p>
      <p>This mixture of Brazilian fluidity and Ukrainian muscle, as Atalanta will discover, serves as a particularly well-rehearsed and dangerous combination in the Champions League.</p>

      <p>That said, Atalanta will head into this game with a singular, driven mindset, knowing that a victory is the only thing capable of taking them into the knockout phases.</p>
      <p>Previously a team that dwelled in the mid-table region, Atalanta's third place finish in Serie A last season stemmed from several years of good work under manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gian-piero-gasperini/"><b>Gian Piero Gasperini</b></a>, who guided the club to fourth during his first campaign in charge.</p>
      <p>Playing with a 3-4-3 system, Atalanta press teams hard from the front and make the game a pacy, open affair whereby the Italian side looks to break into the final third with its wing backs at the forefront of attacks.</p>
      <p>This style has helped them stand out in Serie A, although this has failed to translate to results in Europe, with Atalanta losing their opening three games in poor fashion.</p>
      <p>However, a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/champions-league/result/result-manchester-city-draw-with-atalanta-despite-kyle-walker-ending-up-in-goal_377670.html">1-1 draw</a> with City and a win over Zagreb last time out has laid the platform for a potentially historic victory in eastern Europe this week.</p>

      <p>Shakhtar head into this game with a clean bill of health, meaning that key striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/junior-moraes/"><b>Junior Moraes</b></a>, who has 14 goals in all competitions this term, will start the game up front.</p>
      <p>Atalanta, meanwhile, will hope that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luis-muriel/"><b>Luis Muriel</b></a>, who joined over the summer, can score his 10th goal of the campaign in Ukraine on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The visitors are set to be without <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/josip-ilicic/"><b>Josip Ilicic</b></a>, whose muscle injury looks set to keep him sidelined until 2020.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/duvan-zapata/"><b>Duvan Zapata</b></a> has a chance of making a return for this game after resuming training earlier this month following a thigh injury sustained in October.</p>
      <p><b>Shakhtar Donetsk possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Pyatov; Dodo, Kryvtsov, Matviyenko, Ismaily; Stepanenko, Kovalenko, Alan Patrick, Tete, Konoplyanka; Moraes</p>
      <p><b>Atalanta possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Gollini; Toloi, Kjaer, Palomino; De Roon, Freuler, Hateboer, Gosens; Gomez, Pasalic, Muriel</p>

      <h3>We say: Shakhtar Donetsk 2-1 Atalanta</h3>
      <p>Atalanta's away record in this competition makes them underdogs in this game against Shakhtar, who will feel confident about reaching the knockout phase for the second time in as many seasons.</p>
