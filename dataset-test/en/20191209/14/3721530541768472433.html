      <p>A new studio from 2K Games, Cloud Chamber, is working on the next game in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/bioshock/510">BioShock franchise</a>, the publisher announced today.</p>
      <p>Cloud Chamber has two offices: one in 2K’s San Francisco Bay Area offices in Novato, Calif., and another in Montréal, Québec, with Kelley Gilmore at the studio’s helm. The team’s begun work on the next <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/bioshock/510">BioShock</a> game, but it’s still “several years” away.</p>
      <p>“We founded Cloud Chamber to create yet-to-be-discovered worlds — and their stories within — that push the boundaries of what is possible in the video game medium,” Gilmore said in a news release. “Our team believes in the beauty and strength of diversity, in both the makeup of the studio and the nature of its thinking. We are a deeply experienced group of game makers, including many responsible for <i>BioShock</i>’s principal creation, advancement and longstanding notoriety, and honored to be part of the 2K family as stewards of this iconic franchise.”</p>

      <p>BioShock alumni like Hoagy de la Plante, Scott Sinclair, and Johnathan Pelling are on board at Cloud Chamber, <a href="https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber">Gilmore told IGN</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/23/14717902/irrational-games-changes-name-ghost-story-games">Irrational Games co-founder</a> Kevin Levine, who led development on <i>BioShock</i>, is “not affiliated with Cloud Chamber” or the game’s development, she added.</p>
      <p><i>BioShock Infinite </i>was the last game released as part of the franchise. In 2018, <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">Kotaku reported</a> that some 2K developers had begun working on an unannounced BioShock game.</p>
      <p><b>Update: </b>The next BioShock game has reportedly been in development for years across “two different studios,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-the-new-bioshock-has-been-in-the-works-for-yea-1840314561">according to a Kotaku report</a> published today. According to Kotaku, <i>BioShock 4, </i>code-named Parkside, was originally in development in 2015, but “rebooted” in 2017, which is when 2K Games brought development in-house.</p>
