      <h1>Leicester and Arsenal ‘interested’ in Nigeria international – Player ‘highly favoured’ to make PL switch in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:33:52+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/tom-coast/" target="_blank">Tom Coast</a></address>
      <p>Prior to this season’s Champions League campaign started, few around Europe will have been aware of Emmanuel Dennis.</p>
      <p>However, a double for Club Brugge against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu on October 1st shoved the 22-year-old into the spotlight, and caught the attention of many with his pace and direct style of play.</p>
      <p>Those two attributes fit the Premier League down to a T, which is why it isn’t that surprising to see the likes of Arsenal and Leicester, two clubs known to prioritise such players in their attack, linked with his services.</p>
      <p>The information appears to come directly from Dennis’ home country, Nigeria, as the forward sat down with <a href="https://thenationonlineng.net/dennis-double-goals-against-real-changed-my-life/">The Nation</a> to discuss life in Belgium and his career so far.</p>
      <p>Within the piece, it’s pointed out that <i>‘Dennis is highly favoured to make a giant move to England in January. Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Leicester City, Lyon, Fenerbahce, and Monaco are all believed to have monitored Dennis in the past few seasons’</i>, yet that doesn’t give us an idea of who is keen on him now.</p>
      <p>However, right at the bottom, the website do a little fact file on the Nigeria international, mentioning the clubs seemingly currently ‘interested’ in the player, where they list the names of the teams managed by Brendan Rodgers and (for now) Freddie Ljungberg.</p>
      <p>We’re not saying a transfer will happen, but it’s worth keeping in mind, especially since Dennis is apparently ‘highly favoured’ to make the switch to England in January.</p>
