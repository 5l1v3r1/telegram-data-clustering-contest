      <p>Barcelona star Lionel Messi will not make the trip to Italy for Tuesday’s Champions League game against Inter Milan, the Spanish club confirmed on Monday.</p>
      <p>Barcelona are already through to the last 16 after six-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi scored in a convincing 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund last time out.</p>

      <p>The Spaniards are also sure of finishing top of Group F as they have 11 points from five games.</p>
      <p>Antonio Conte’s Inter still have to book their place in the last 16. They are second, level on seven points with Borussia Dortmund who host Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>Inter will qualify if the two clubs finish on the same number of points due to their superior head-to-head goal difference.</p>
