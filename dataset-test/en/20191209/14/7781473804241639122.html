      <p>The Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 was updated with a dual-channel ABS in January 2019. The update was in regard to the stricter safety norms regulated in the country. Speaking of the norms, the Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 has now been tuned to meet the emission standards of BSVI. And in the trade, the motorcycle has lost 0.7PS of power and 0.6Nm of torque. Also, the BSVI model is dearer to its customers. The price has been hiked from Rs 1.39 lakh up to Rs 1.45 lakh ex-showroom Delhi.</p>
