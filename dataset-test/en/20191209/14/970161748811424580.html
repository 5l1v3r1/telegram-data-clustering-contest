      <h1>Mum wet herself after Vue staff refused to let her use the toilet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:18:07+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Roberts</a></address>
      <p>A disabled woman has hit out at Vue cinema after she was forced to wet herself when heartless staff refused to let her use their toilet.</p>
      <p>Camille James, 36, said she ‘bared her life out’ to four workers at the Vue Acton Park in west London, telling them all about her type 1 diabetes and severe bladder dysfunction.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-one thought they were ‘joking’ when they refused again and pointed at a ‘customers only’ sign.</p>
      <p>But when she tried to walk around them to the nearby disabled toilet, a security guard blocked her from walking any further.</p>
      <p>She was just about to wet herself but managed to make it to her car where she couldn’t hold it any longer.</p>
      <p>Camille told Metro.co.uk: ‘I just sat down in my car and started crying. I could not believe what had happened.</p>
      <p>‘I felt so degraded by the end of it. I had to go pick up my son smelling of urine.’</p>
      <p>Her bladder condition means she often needs to use a toilet within a matter of minutes if it flares up.</p>
      <p>This happened when Camille got stuck in traffic on the A40 last Tuesday, and she had no choice but to head to the nearest disabled toilet at the Vue cinema.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Sometimes it’s hard enough having to say you’re disabled and I had to tell four strangers that I have a bladder dysfunction and I was going to wet myself. And I still received no empathy.</p>

      <p>‘I told them, ”My car’s parked in your disabled bay with my badge displayed, I really need to use your toilet.”</p>
      <p>‘There were two males and two females standing there, none of them were doing anything.</p>
      <p>‘Even if they had concerns, one of them could have walked me to the toilet. They could see the toilet from where they were standing.</p>
      <p>‘They asked me why I came there and I told them they were the closest toilet to the A40 and they have a disabled bay outside.</p>
      <p>‘They’ve let me use the toilet before so why would I go any further?</p>
      <p>‘I honestly thought they were joking and went to walk around them and this security guard came out in front to stop me.</p>
      <p>‘I told them, “Look, I’m disabled but they said it’s for customers only and pointed at their sign which said so.</p>
      <p>‘I said “Yes I know the sign is there but I’ve got bladder problems, I’m diabetic, my bloody sugar is really high right now.</p>
      <p>‘I’m on an insulin pump and I held it through my top to show them. I said, “Oh come on, please, you’ve let me use it before, you know I’m a regular customer.</p>

      <p>‘But they didn’t say anything. I’m pleading with them and they say why don’t you just go to Costa.</p>
      <p>‘I just froze. I couldn’t believe what they were doing. I thought I might be able to make it to Costa, so I walked out but as I reached my car I started to pee myself.’</p>
      <p>Camille was so upset she recorded a video of herself explaining what had happened just minutes after.</p>
      <p>It’s the first time she has spoken out about some of the horrific experiences she endures on an almost daily basis.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘When I walked out I even thought I should have wet myself there in front of them and made them clean it up.</p>
      <p>‘But I have self-respect and held it until I got outside. I’m not the sort of person to think like that but that’s how they made me feel.’</p>
      <p>Camille says the biggest problem she faces is that her disability is ‘unseen’.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I face is unseen disabilities. I have a disabled badge but I get nasty notes on my car and the rest, because I’m well put together.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got a decent job so I have to look decent all the time. People really need to grasp unseen disabilities because people don’t know what’s going on inside and they don’t know what I’m going through.’</p>
      <p>A Vue spokesperson has now apologised and insisted the cinema chain does have a ‘clear policy’ that ensures guests who need to use a toilet can do so.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the spokesperson said: ‘The comfort and wellbeing of all of our guests is something we take very seriously and we are extremely disappointed to learn that this experience was not provided.</p>
      <p>‘Vue has a clear policy in place that ensures guests who need to use toilet facilities are able to do so, and are looked after with compassion and discretion.</p>
      <p>‘We apologise that on this occasion that did not occur and we will address this immediately.’</p>
