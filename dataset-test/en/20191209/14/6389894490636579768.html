      <p>Analysts told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tycoon-hands-wants-to-build-new-home-with-ailing-kier-11882325">Sky New</a>s that the company could be worth an estimated £150m, however it is believed Terra Firma have put in a lower bid.</p>
      <p>Kier’s investment and development arm Kier Property is also up for sale, with US private equity firm Lone Star reportedly interested.</p>
      <p>The company is expected to give an update on both of the sales early in the new year.</p>
      <p>Kier has fallen on tough times recently, experiencing an 80 per cent decline in value over the past year.</p>
      <p>This forced the company to undertake rescue fundraising from shareholders, while its chief operating officer Claudio Veritiero resigned last month.</p>
      <p>Kier is one of the country’s biggest builders of roads, schools and railways, and carries out a significant amount of work for the government.</p>
      <p>This includes two contracts worth £1.4bn to design and build major railway tunnels beneath Northamptonshire, which were originally part of a three-way joint venture including Carillion. </p>
      <p>However, when Carillion collapsed early last year, Kier and French construction company Eiffage took on 50 per cent of the job each.</p>
