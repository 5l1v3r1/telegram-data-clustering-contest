      <h1>Owner of £3m apartment sues Heron Tower for £100,000 after enduring two years without broadband</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:23:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>A millionaire is suing for £100,000 after going two years without broadband at his £3 million apartment and being forced to log on at his local library.</p>
      <p>Businessman Stephen Shalson has claimed breach of contract over his residence at The Heron tower in London, with his legal team arguing that “given the price” an internet connection was expected when bought the property in 2014.  </p>
      <p>Instead for two years the 70-year-old executive, who made his money in the travel industry, had to descend the 30 floors from his deluxe apartment and journey to his local library and internet cafe to get online.</p>
      <p>He is now suing the owners of the towering building, which boasts a roof terrace and private members' club, after living without broadband until 2016, when a connection was finally established.</p>
      <p>Heron Residences LLP contends that broadband was not in the terms of sale.</p>
      <p>Mr Shalson’s barrister Daniel Goodkin, who brought the case to the Central London County Court, said:  "Given the price of the apartment, the fact that it was a new luxury development, and its situation in central London, it was so obvious as not to require express statement that the apartment would have a good quality internet service.</p>
      <p>"He paid £2.95 million for this apartment in a brand new high luxury residential development and did not have any internet.”</p>
      <p>Mr Shalson is claiming around £100 for each day of his low-tech lifestyle, when he travelled to cafes, libraries, and his brother’s Hamstead home to log on. </p>
      <p>Heron Residences denies liability, claiming that internet access was not part of the terms of sale.  The legal team for the real estate group had previously argued bringing the case was an "abuse of the legal process".</p>
      <p>Mr Shalson still lives in the 30th floor apartment, which he says is “a nice place”.</p>
