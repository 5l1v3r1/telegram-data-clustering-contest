      <p>Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside. The debut trailer for <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-ghostbusters-sequels-title-and-first-official-photo-1840269529"><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i></a><i> </i>takes the spectral hunting out of the city and into a small town, where a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-ghostbusters-family-looks-adorable-ready-to-hu-1836339173">family with surprising connections</a> to the original Ghostbusters is forced to return to their roots and bust some rural ghosts.</p>

      <p><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i>, directed by Jason Reitman and produced by Ivan Reitman, presents the next chapter in the <i>Ghostbusters</i> series—and it’s quite different from its predecessors. The sad, somber trailer centers around a single mom named Callie (Carrie Coon), who moves into a mansion owned by her late father, who she never really knew.</p>
      <p>It turns out, her father was Dr. Egon Spengler, played by <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/r-i-p-harold-ramis-the-man-who-gave-us-ghostbusters-a-1529839951">the late Harold Ramis</a> in the original <i>Ghostbusters</i> and its sequel. It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, given how his granddaughter Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) is his spitting image. However, it does raise some questions about when Spengler had a child, why she wasn’t part of his life, and why Callie was seemingly kept secret from everyone he knew. Considering a few of those old friends of Egon will be <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/its-confirmed-bill-murray-will-show-up-as-peter-venkma-1839756468">appearing in <i>Afterlife</i></a>, it’ll be an intriguing mystery to uncover.</p>
      <p>As Phoebe and her brother Travis (<i>Stranger Things</i>’ Finn Wolfhard) explore the old and creepy mansion, they learn all about their grandfather and his legacy as a member of the Ghostbusters—partially thanks to their science teacher, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/paul-rudd-is-joining-the-next-ghostbusters-but-maybe-n-1835910935">played by Paul Rudd</a>. Together, they uncover a strange, supernatural occurrence underneath their small town and have to work together to stop it. I’m guessing it’s going to involve the busting of some ghosts—because <i>of course</i>—including Slimer, who makes a mischievous appearance during the trailer.</p>
      <p><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife </i>arrives in theaters in summer 2020.</p>
