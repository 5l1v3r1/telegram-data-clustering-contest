      <p>The US$68 per share acquisition price represents a 172per cent premium to Synthorx’s closing price on Dec 6, 2019.</p>
      <p>"This acquisition ... is aligned with our goal to build our oncology franchise with potentially practice-changing medicines and novel combinations," Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Sanofi is conducting a broad strategy review under new chief executive Paul Hudson, who will give some initial pointers on which businesses he wants to focus on at an investor day on Dec 10.</p>
