      <p>Robbie Williams has asked Ant and Dec if they will take him on for I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here 2020.</p>
      <p>The singer tried to strike a deal with the TV presenters during his show Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show on ITV.</p>
      <p>“What about the next series?” he asked the duo via a Skype chat.</p>

      <p>“Any guests lined up?”</p>
      <p>The singer tried to secure a multi-million pound deal for his appearance on the series next year, joking:</p>
      <p>“So a really famous singer will get paid millions for going on I’m A Celeb right?”</p>

      <p>Not one to give up easily, he continued:</p>
      <p>“Boys what do you say? How am I looking for the next series?”</p>
      <p>However, Ant and Dec remained tight lipped about their prospective celeb contestants for the next year’s series.</p>
      <p>The 2019 series has just wrapped up, with soap star Jacqueline Jossa securing the title of queen of the jungle.</p>
