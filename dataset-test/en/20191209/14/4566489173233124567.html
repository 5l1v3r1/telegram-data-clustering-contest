      <p>Lovers of very expensive whisky will get the chance to bid on nearly 4,000 rare bottles acquired by a late US soft drink bottling company executive.</p>
      <p>The Whisky Auctioneer company said on Monday the so-called "Perfect Collection" includes some bottles believed to be worth millions of pounds, "some of which have never before been seen".</p>
      <p>"It's the largest collection by value, by volume as well," Whisky Auctioneer founder Iain McClune said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The bottles were collected by Richard Gooding, the head of a Pepsi bottling company who died in 2014.</p>
      <p>Gooding travelled repeatedly to Scotland to find special bottles from small distilleries, "some of which have ceased to exist," the company said.</p>
      <p>They include a bottle of 1926 Fine and Rare Macallan, one of which became the most expensive in the world when it sold for Â£1.5 million ($1.9 million, 1.8 million euros) in October.</p>
      <p>The collection will become available in two online auctions organised by the company from February 7-17 and April 10-20 of next year.</p>
      <p>"He loved every aspect of it, from researching the many single malt distilleries to visiting them and tasting their whiskies," Gooding's widow Nancy said on the auctioneer's website.</p>
      <p>"His mission was to collect a bottle that represented every single distillery."</p>
