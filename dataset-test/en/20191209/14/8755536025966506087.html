      <p>Betting firm Paddy Power have tipped the couple to get their own reality show, as they make their marriage work following <a href="http://goss.ie/featured/jacqueline-jossa-and-dan-osborne-in-private-crisis-talks-amid-cheating-allegations-193126">allegations of infidelity made against Dan</a>.</p>

      <p>The star stands to earn over one million GBP from her stint on the show.</p>
      <p>She is tipped to land a coveted lead role in a pantomime next year off the back of her win.</p>
      <p>“She can earn £10,000 to £200,000 in the first few months by newspaper and magazine interviews, plus TV appearances and personal appearances in clubs and resorts at home and overseas,” wealth management expert Richard Simpson told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10512639/im-a-celebrity-winner-jacqueline-jossa-million-tax-bill/">The Sun.</a></p>

      <p>Jacqueline became the first winner in I’m A Celeb history to decline media interviews after leaving the jungle.</p>
      <p><a href="http://goss.ie/featured/jacqueline-jossa-and-dan-osborne-in-private-crisis-talks-amid-cheating-allegations-193126">The star has reportedly been whisked away</a> to engage in “crisis talks” with her husband regarding the allegations that emerged during her time on the show.</p>
      <p>Dan was forced to deny rumours that he <a href="http://goss.ie/uk-showbiz/gabby-allen-brands-myles-stephenson-a-liar-amid-im-a-celeb-cheating-scandal-192287">engaged in an affair with Love Island star Gabby Allen</a>, and to deny a <a href="http://goss.ie/tv/dan-osborne-opens-up-about-tough-times-amid-threesome-cheating-allegations-193055">claim made by model Chloe Ayling</a> that he had a three-person sexual encounter with her and a second model.</p>
