      <h1>Family's fury over M&amp;S Christmas tree that's getting scathing reviews</h1>
      <h2>Marks and Spencer advertises the £35 tree as a “sparkling surprise”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:36:54+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Longstaff, Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>A mother has blasted Marks and Spencer after discovering her new fake Christmas tree looks like "a twig without any leaves".</p>
      <p>Aniela Jasionowicz, 29, bought the £35 tree - which comes with a set of decorations - from the M&amp;S website.</p>
      <p>But she said the 6ft decoration looks nothing like the bushy tree on the website.</p>
      <p>Aniela from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, said: “I was hugely disappointed because we put a lot of time and effort into putting the tree up.</p>
      <p>“We took it down straight away because it looks awful.</p>
      <p>“It looks like a twig without any leaves. I expected a quality product but that’s not what we got.</p>
      <p>“The image on the website does not represent the product and I feel like we were sold short.”</p>

      <p>Marks and Spencer advertises the tree as a “sparkling surprise” and comes with pre-lit lights and 59 separate decorations.</p>
      <p>Personal assistant Aniela, who is married to Stefan 29, said the couple were especially excited to decorate their house for their daughter’s first Christmas.</p>
      <p>Talia is six-months-old and Aniela wanted to make this Christmas extra special for her.</p>
      <p>But with just over two weeks to go before Christmas the family are yet to find a replacement tree and have been given a refund by M&amp;S following a complaint.</p>
      <p>Aniela added: “The photo of it online looked great and I thought it’d look really nice.</p>
      <p>“I thought I had got myself a great deal.</p>
      <p>“But for me it is false advertising. I was really disappointed because it looks like a completely different tree altogether.”</p>
      <p>Other less than impressed customers have left some equally scathing reviews about the product online.</p>
      <p>One shopper gave the tree a one star rating, saying it is of "poor quality" and "not value for money".</p>

      <p>Other people said: "The tree is very cheaply made and looks dead."</p>
      <p>"We are so disappointed with this tree. It’s so sparse it looks awful. Thought we could rely on Marks for quality but seems that’s no longer true.</p>
      <p>"The pictures online are completely different to the tree you get. A toilet brush has more branches.</p>
      <p>"Tree is VERY sparse and really bare with the branches. Had to add extra lights, baubles, thin tinsel and beading to fill it out. Not impressed with quality at all."</p>
      <p>M&amp;S have given Aniela a full refund and a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture. </p>
