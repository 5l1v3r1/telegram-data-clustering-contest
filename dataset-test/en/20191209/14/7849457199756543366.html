      <p>The said temperature was recorded by the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) at 6 a.m.</p>
      <p>This is so far the lowest temperature recorded in the summer capital of the Philippines this December.</p>
      <p>Weather experts expect the weather in Baguio to become cooler for the rest of the month because of the cold spell.</p>
      <p>The cold spell is being caused by the northeast monsoon or “amihan”.</p>
      <p>The lowest recorded temperature in Baguio this year was at 9.8 degrees Celsius which was recorded on January 28.</p>
      <p>Baguio has long been attracting tourist, both local and foreign, because of its cooler climate compared to the rest of the country.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Metro Manila also recorded its lowest temperature at 21.9 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>This has been the lowest recorded temperature for Metro Manila since October 25.</p>
      <p>Ariel Rojas, weather specialist for PAGASA said that the lowest temperature in Metro Manila was observed at around 5:30 a.m. at its Science Garden monitoring station in Quezon City. <i>(with a report from Ellalyn de Vera-Ruiz)</i></p>
