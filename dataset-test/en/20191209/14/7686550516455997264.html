      <h1>Amanda Holden's savage jibe at Phillip Schofield as he faces complaint from Ruth Langsford</h1>
      <h2>Amanda has let slip they are still feuding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:24:21+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author">Cathy Owen</a></address>
      <p>Amanda Holden has spoke out after rumours about Phillip Schofield's behaviour behind the scenes of The Morning.</p>
      <p>Days after it was claimed Ruth Langsford made an official complaint about Phil and reports that his relationship with Holly has soured , Amanda offered the Loose Women host her support.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/phillip-schofield-speaks-out-after-16475445">he came under criticism </a>from fellow ITV star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amanda-holden">Amanda Holden</a> , who reportedly claimed Phil "cost" her a presenting role on This Morning - branding her "hard to manage."</p>
      <p>He defended himself saying he hoped that his fans "know him better".</p>
      <p>Now, Amanda has let slip they are still feuding on her Heart Breakfast show.</p>

      <p>Ashley Roberts presented her showbiz segment and said: "Lots of buzz around Philip Schofield at the moment. There are reports that things are a little tense between him and Holly Willoughby as well as Ruth Langsford.</p>
      <p>"ITV says it's just gossip and that he and Holly are great friends, both on and off screen."</p>
      <p>"If only there was someone here who might be able to help us with that story," joked Amanda's co-host Jamie Theakston.</p>
      <p>"Listen, I've drawn a line under all those issues with Phillip," Amanda said guardedly.</p>
      <p>"Just give us some kind of...?" asked Jamie hopefully.</p>
      <p>"Well I'm just gonna say that I really admire anyone that sticks up for themselves because it is not an easy thing to do," Amanda said.</p>
      <p>"There is a tin opener and there's a can somewhere and other people have found the tin opener. That's all I'm saying," she added.</p>
      <p>"Right, OK!" laughed Ashley nervously.</p>
      <p>Amanda has made no secret of her dislike of Schofied, who she blamed for scuppering her chance of hosting This Morning while Holly Willoughby was away in Australia hosting last year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!.</p>
      <p>Amanda was said to have landed her dream job on a temporary basis - but the offer was withdrawn after Phil allegedly told ITV bosses he didn't want her sharing his sofa.</p>
      <p>Holly's role ended up being given to former pop star Rochelle Humes, 29.</p>
      <p>Phil has been at the centre of a rumours about his workplace conduct for months, although ITV has continued to deny any issues between the talent.</p>

      <p>He's said to have a strained relationship with Holly, despite them going on family holidays together, and is the subject of a complaint by Ruth after he interrupted her live on air.</p>
      <p>But these have been dismissed as "malicious gossip" by the broadcaster.</p>
      <p>This Morning editor Martin Frizell hit back at the claims and said Phillip and Holly had a "genuine friendship".</p>
      <p>He added: "We have the smartest viewers watching telly and believe me they would be the first to notice any issues - they havenâ€™t because there are none."</p>
      <p>ITV also refuted any unrest, saying in a full statement: "It's deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.</p>
      <p>"Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise.</p>
      <p>"Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike."</p>
