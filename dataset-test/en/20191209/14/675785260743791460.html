      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:03:56+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/red-bull-salzburg">Red Bull Salzburg</a> hotshot Erling Haaland has warned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> he's ready to end their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> hopes... and will do it with a smile on his face.</p>
      <p>The Austrian upstarts know that a win on home soil against Jurgen Klopp's European champions on Tuesday will dump the Reds out of the competition - and send Salzburg into the last 16.</p>
      <p>Salzburg see their group finale as a bonus, having already achieved the expectation of securing third spot and a Europa League place after Christmas.</p>
      <p>But now they're looking to dump Liverpool into UEFA's secondary competition instead, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/erling-braut-haaland">Haaland</a> is relishing the prospect.</p>
      <p>"We have nothing to lose," said the Norwegian teen. "We will go out there and enjoy ourselves, smile, enjoy the game.</p>

      <p>"It's the biggest game of my life so far and I'm looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>"I'm living the dream and its matches like this that you dream of."</p>
      <p>Haaland has become the hottest young prospect in European football, having scored in each of their five group games so far.</p>
      <p>But he insists he's paying no attention to transfer speculation.</p>
      <p>"I just focus on my job, playing football, enjoying what I do every day. Enjoying the moment, right now, and to focus on Salzburg."</p>

      <p>Coach Jesse Marsch will become the first American to lead a side into the Champions League knockout stages if his side can pull off a surprise upset.</p>
      <p>"We see it as an opportunity for us," said Marsch.</p>
      <p>"We go into the game with a relaxed mind, and will give everything that we have.</p>
      <p>"It's crazy this opportunity for us. We are ready to make something special tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp plans to continue his recent rotation policy and looks set to make a number of changes from the side that beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> so comprehensively on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Reds' manager was able to rest Divock Origi and Sadio Mane following their starring roles against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> in midweek, and both are in line to feature.</p>
      <p>Klopp said: "We’ll see how we start on Tuesday, I have no idea about that now. But we could give these two [Origi and Mane], plus Gini [Wijnaldum] and Adam [Lallana], so four players kind of a rest and hopefully they are all fit again for Tuesday and we will make decisions.”</p>
