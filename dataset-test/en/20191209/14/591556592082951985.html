      <p>There's been a large hole in my life for the last couple of years.<br/><br/>No, it's not <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hey-apple-heres-how-i-solved-my-macbook-keyboard-problem/">the lack of a MacBook keyboard that works</a>. That hole's existed for just over a year. <br/><br/>This particularly large, two-year hole has been getting bigger every day as it gnaws at my jaws. It began <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-x/">when Apple launched iPhone X</a>. <br/><br/>At the time, data scientists and other numerical experts observed that Apple had skipped a beat. Or rather had skipped iPhone 9.<br/><br/>Rationalist logicians insisted this was because it was the iPhone's 10th anniversary, so Apple wanted to celebrate that. I couldn't help thinking it was just as likely because Samsung had already released its Galaxy S9, so an iPhone 9 wouldn't sound so exciting. And, well, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-turned-ugly-into-beautiful-or-at-least-normal/">it had an exciting new notch</a>, so it needed an exciting new name.</p>
      <p>I still mourned the loss of the 9. It was symbolically awkward that the iPhone had lost its ninth life.<br/><br/>Now, however, a rumor has emerged that the iPhone 9 might rise from the dead. Japanese site MacOtakara <a href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-38948.html">is suggesting</a> that the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-se-2-coming-next-year-but-will-the-price-be-right/">rumored new iPhone SE 2, </a>which may or may not emerge in March, will actually be called iPhone 9. This new phone will allegedly have a 4.7-inch screen, and, goodness, a home button.</p>
      <p>It'll surely be for those with slightly smaller hands and tiny suspicions about Face ID. It'll also be a charming trip to the past -- something shiny, but reassuring. Like Michael Bublé. <br/><br/>Some say <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/670476/iphone-9-apple-2020-budget-handset-se-2/">MacOtakara has purveyed reliable rumors</a> in the past. I wouldn't dream, however, of venturing the actual possibility of this gap in my life being filled.<br/><br/>I hope, however, it is. Not merely for the satisfaction of a sequence restored, but for the adorable prospect of Apple's SVP of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, attempting to give a deeply nuanced explanation for the name.<br/><br/>After all, he's already admitted that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reveals-what-the-r-stands-for-in-iphone-xr/">the XR in iPhone XR means negative squat</a>. What tale could he concoct to justify the belated appearance of the iPhone 9? <br/><br/>Will he claim nine is Tim Cook's favorite number? Will he insist this was always Apple's devious plan? <br/><br/>Oh, I know. He'll say it's a spontaneous homage to Apple's neighbors, the San Francisco 49ers after they actually reach the Super Bowl again. (Disclosure: No, not a Niners fan.)</p>
