        <b>Club legend Duncan Ferguson is now favourite to be Everton's next permanent manager despite reports that Unai Emery has been approached about the role.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ferguson was given a hero's reception by the Goodison Park faithful before his side then earned a pulsating 3-1 win over Chelsea that had the famous old ground bouncing once again.</p>

          </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It was a performance full of grit, determination and energy that embodied Ferguson's feeling for the club, and just what the fans would have wanted to see in their first game after the exit of Marco Silva.</p>
      <p>Ferguson was seen prowling and prancing up and down the touchline cajoling his charges, and the performance of both the manager and the players has seen the former centre forward now installed as the favourite to become the club's next full-time manager.</p>

      <p>This comes despite reports that former Arsenal boss Unai Emery has been contacted by Farhad Moshiri's representatives about taking the role, and the fact former Bayern Munich boss Nimo Kovac was in the directors' box for the Chelsea game.</p>
      <p>Ferguson deflected talk of him wanting the job full-time as he caught his breath after overseeing the Chelsea win.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if I can go through this again," Ferguson said after the match. "I need to get my fitness up that's for sure the way I was running up and down the touchline.</p>
      <p>"It was the one game, I'm made up, delighted for the fans. Three points is massive for us."</p>
      <p>When asked why Kovac was present in the crowd at Goodison, Ferguson added: "Haven't a clue. I am sure he enjoyed the game.</p>
      <p>"Whoever it is (new manager) they are coming to a fantastic football club when fans create an atmosphere like that."</p>
      <p>Emery was dismissed by Arsenal after just 18 months in charge, but reports now suggest that the Toffees have already been in contact with the Spaniard about taking the permanent role on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>David Moyes has been the favourite for some time but he has now seemingly tumbled down the pecking order with other candidates looking like more preferable options.</p>
      <p>Former Porto boss Vitor Pereira is still among the favourites, while River Plate boss Marcelo Gallardo is also an interesting option, with the former Argentina international also thought to be on Arsenal and Barcelona's radar.</p>
