      <p>The <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/will-act-and-react-as-one-european-union-on-proposed-us-tariffs-on-french-goods-265977">EU's</a> powerful anti-trust authority on Monday approved billions of euros in subsidies from seven member states as Europe seeks to make up lost ground in the highly strategic sector of electric batteries.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a major push led by Germany and France to prepare Europe for the emergence of electric cars, as gas combustible engines are phased out over concerns for the environment.</p>
      <p>The European car industry employs over 10 million people and the EU, led by Germany and France, is deeply concerned about Europe's dependence on car batteries from Asia.</p>
      <p>The mega subsidy of 3.2 billion euros ($3.5 billion) from Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Belgium, Sweden and Finland will go to a consortium of 17 companies and will help generate an extra 5 billion euros in private investment, a statement said.</p>
      <p>The commission, the EU's anti-trust enforcer, usually holds a strict line against state subsidies, but in 2014 gave more leeway for countries to back strategic transnational projects.</p>
      <p>The wave of new subsidies are part of something called the European Battery Alliance. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/european-union-leaders-to-push-for-climate-neutrality-by-2050-sources-265831">The campaign</a>, launched in 2017, was designed to entice European industry to create an Airbus of batteries, in reference to the aviation giant that was born of a similar ambition a generation ago.</p>
      <p>Companies involved include German car giant BMW and chemical multinationals BASF and Solvay.</p>
