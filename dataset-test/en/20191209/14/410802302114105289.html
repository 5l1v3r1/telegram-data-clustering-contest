      <p>Her incredibly full life has also provided most of the content for her blog and Instagram page but at the core of it all, Leshabane is all about being a giver and a superwoman.</p>
      <p>When it comes to unwinding, she swears by meditation, prayer, blogging, a long bath or just relaxing with a book. And when it comes to surviving the holidays with your kids around, here are a few tips she swears by:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Find a grandparent</li>
        <li>Give the kids a new hobby</li>
        <li>Drop the kids off at holiday daycare a few days a week</li>
        <li>Find creative ways to keep them busy at home</li>
        <li>Sign them up for reading clubs</li>
      </ol>
