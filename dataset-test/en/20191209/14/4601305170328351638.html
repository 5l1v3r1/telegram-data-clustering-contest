      <h1>Podcast: Party Discipline, a Walkaway story (Part 2)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:50:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>In my latest podcast (<a href="https://archive.org/download/Cory_Doctorow_Podcast_318/Cory_Doctorow_Podcast_318_-_Party_Discipline_2.mp3">MP3</a>), I continue my serial reading of my novella <a href="https://www.tor.com/2017/08/30/party-discipline/">Party Discipline</a>, which I wrote while on a 35-city, 45-day tour for my novel <a href="https://www.tor.com/2017/08/30/party-discipline/">Walkaway</a> in 2017; Party Discipline is a story set in the world of Walkaway, about two high-school seniors who conspire to throw a "Communist Party" at a sheet metal factory whose owners are shutting down and stealing their workers' final paychecks. These parties are both literally parties -- music, dancing, intoxicants -- and "Communist" in that the partygoers take over the means of production and start them up, giving away the products they create to the attendees. Walkaway opens with a Communist Party and I wanted to dig into what might go into pulling one of those off.</p>
      <blockquote>The cop pulled the vice principal’s chair out from behind the desk and sat down on it in front of us. He didn’t say anything. He was young, I saw, not much older than us, and still had some acne on one cheek. White dude. Not my type, but good looking, except that he was a cop and he was playing mind games with us. <br/><br/>“Are we being detained?” Somewhere in my bag was a Black Lives Matter bust-card and while I’d forgotten almost everything written on it, I remembered that this was the first question I should ask. <br/><br/>“You are here at the request of your school administration.” Oh. Even when there wasn’t a fresh lockdown, the administration had plenty of powers to search us, ask us all kinds of nosy questions. And after a lockdown? Forget it.</blockquote>
