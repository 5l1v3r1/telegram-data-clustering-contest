      <h1>This brand needs sex toy testers to join their 'MasturbaTEAM'</h1>

      <p>Ever used a G-spot rabbit vibrator and thought ‘impressive machinery, could be quieter’?</p>
      <p>Or perhaps the speed settings weren’t quite to your tastes or the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/11/womans-online-sex-toy-order-goes-embarrassingly-wrong-10173477/">packaging wasn’t as discreet as it could be</a>.</p>
      <p>If you’ve tried and tested various sex toys and felt like you could use them for a living then we’ve got just the job for you*.</p>
      <p>*It’s unpaid, but still, free orgasms for all.</p>
      <p>The folks at Wow Tech group brands We-Vibe and Womanizer want people to try out their sex toys to enhance their range and understanding of the market.</p>
      <p>Volunteers will be joining what they’re calling the MasturbaTEAM, made up of roughly 1,000 men and women across Europe.</p>
      <p>Each applicant will need to fill in a few details to find an available product that matches their preferences.</p>
      <p>Then the team will send out a device in discreet packaging. And then what? Then you masturbate – for science.</p>
      <p>Participants are required to fill out a questionnaire with their honest feedback.</p>
      <p>The results of the questionnaires are then evaluated internally, anonymously and passed on to the respective specialist departments.</p>
      <p>The delivery addresses are deleted after the products have been dispatched. And the toy can, of course, be kept as a thank-you and reward for your efforts.</p>

      <p>‘Our goal is to develop products that satisfy customer needs and desires,’ says Johanna Rief, Head of Sexual Empowerment.</p>
      <p>‘Both [brand] ranges boast sex-tech products that not only look stylish but are of high quality with an innovative and revolutionary design.</p>
      <p>‘But this is only possible if we incorporate the opinions and feedback of our users directly into product development.’</p>
      <p>She adds: ‘We take our job very seriously and invest in research. All new products go through several developments and testing phases. From the alpha test with 10-20 employees to the actual product test with about 100 external testers.’</p>
      <p>Interested pleasure seekers can <a href="https://wowtechusertesting.questionpro.eu/a/panel.do?languageID=0">apply via the Wow Tech Group website</a>.</p>
