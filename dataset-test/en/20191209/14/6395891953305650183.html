      <p>Martin County officials will auction a fire station that was built in Jensen Beach in 1976, <a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/2019/12/06/former-martin-county-fire-station-up-auction-next-week/2613746001/">TCPalm </a>reported. The building has been rezoned for limited commercial use and will be sold at noon Tuesday, according to <a href="https://www.elliotpaul.com/auctions/detail/former-fire-station-for-sale-only-at-auction-by-the-directio-bw44582">Elliot Paul &amp; Company Auctions,</a> which is handling the transaction.</p>

      <p>The 3,390-square-foot building has four rollup doors and has a market value of $187,940, according to the Martin County Property Appraiser’s Office.</p>
      <p>“There’s really no reason (Martin County) should own these lots,” Elliot Paul, the Stuart-based auctioneer, told <a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/2019/12/06/former-martin-county-fire-station-up-auction-next-week/2613746001/">TCPalm</a>.</p>
      <p>Potential buyers must bring a $25,000 cashier’s check, payable to themselves, the website reported. The high bidder can apply the check toward the 10% deposit required when the auction closes.</p>
