      <h1>Manuel Pellegrini insists West Ham's position is not "critical" ahead of Arsenal clash</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers have won just one of their last ten games heading into Monday's meeting in Stratford</h2>

      <p>West Ham take on Arsenal on Monday night for a London derby that matches two dreadfully out of form teams in dire need of a pick-me-up result to get their seasons back on track.</p>
      <p>The Hammers have won just one of their last ten games to slide from a high of joint-third in the table to a low of 15th prior to beating Chelsea, while Arsenal are on their worst run since the 70s as they haven't won any of their last nine games.</p>
      <p>Arsenal sacked Unai Emery as manager after a dreadful run of form while the Hammers opted to sit tight and kept on Manuel Pellegrini, who alleviated some of the pressure on himself by beating Chelsea but it was firmly whacked on him again when his team followed that up with a 2-0 loss at Wolves.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg is in temporary charge in north London and has yet to win either of his two games, drawing away at Norwich and losing at home to Brighton in a game which the Swede said the Gunners players were "scared."</p>
      <p>West Ham have won just once game since September 22 when they beat Manchester United in E20 but manager Pellegrini insists that his team is not in a "critical moment" when the two vastly underperforming sides face off on Monday night.</p>
      <p>"We are in a special season maybe because the league is so tight so if you win one you are in eighth position in the table.</p>
      <p>"We are not in a critical moment.</p>

      <p>"Normally teams that are not having good results, they feel they are tired.</p>
      <p>"It can happen to all the teams here – one moment United, with our team, with Arsenal, with Tottenham – but I don’t think that it is a physical or tactical thing. I think it is more mental."</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio could return for the Hammers on Monday having missed the Wolves game with a small groin injury but the forward has declared himself ready to go.</p>
      <p>Robvert Snodgrass remains a doubt for the game with an i9njury he sustained when missing a chance against Wolves while Manuel Lanzini and Lukasz Fabianski are out.</p>
      <p>Winston Reid and Jack Wilshere are both in full traning as well as they target returns from injury.</p>
