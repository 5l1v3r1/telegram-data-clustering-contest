      <h1>Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Possible Oral Treatment for Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson’s</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:30:37+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Forest Ray</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.biospace.com/">Aptinyx</a> will soon open a Phase 2 clinical study of NYX-458, a potential oral treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD).</p>
      <p>Although the main features of Parkinson’s involve <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/">difficulties with mobility and motor function</a>, many patients also experience <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/">non-motor symptoms</a> that include <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/cognitive-impairment/">cognitive problems</a>, for which few options exist.</p>
      <p>Parkinson’s is a progressive disease of the nervous system, but “more than half of all people suffering from the disease are also afflicted by cognitive symptoms,” C. Warren Olanow, MD, a professor emeritus in the Departments of Neurology and Neuroscience at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and a Parkinson’s expert, said in a <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/aptinyx-initiates-phase-2-study-of-nyx-458-in-patients-with-mild-cognitive-impairment-associated-with-parkinson-s-disease/">press release</a>.</p>
      <p>These cognitive symptoms include impaired thought processes and memory, resulting in a form of dementia. Many researchers believe that these symptoms are caused by changes in the function of a molecule called the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.</p>
      <p>These receptors are involved in the communication between nerve cells and help regulate synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of synapses — the junctions between two nerve cells that allow them to communicate — to form strong connections and to reduce ones that are no longer needed. In this way, we form stable memories of important events, while allowing less vital memories to fade.</p>
      <p>NYX-458 is a small molecule compound that controls the activity of the NMDA receptor.</p>
      <p>The Phase 2 trial (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04148391?term=Aptinyx+NYX-458&amp;cond=Parkinson+Disease&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">NCT04148391</a>) is a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Its goal is to determine the safe dosing and potential cognitive benefits of NYX-458.</p>
      <p>Up to 135 trial patients, ages 50 to 80, will receive daily oral doses of 10 mg, 30 mg, or 100 mg of the investigative medication, or a placebo capsule, over a 12-week period. NYX-458’s efficacy will be measured by how it affects patients’ memory, attention, executive function, visuospatial deficits, and quality of life.</p>
      <p>The trial is not yet recruiting. Current enrollment information can be found <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04148391?term=Aptinyx+NYX-458&amp;cond=Parkinson+Disease&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1#contacts">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Addressing NMDA receptor dysfunction would mark an important therapeutic advance. “Indeed,” said Olanow, “no therapy has been approved for the treatment of MCI [mild cognitive impairment] in PD, which remains a substantial unmet need.”</p>
      <p>Aptinyx previously <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2018/08/07/aptinyx-potential-parkinsons-therapy-nyx-458-enters-phase-1-trial/">reported</a> that NYX-458 successfully reversed cognitive deficits in a non-human primate model of Parkinson’s disease. NYX-458 significantly increased attention, improved cognitive flexibility, and enhanced working memory as quickly as two hours after the administration of a single oral dose. Those effects were maintained for up to three weeks. No major safety or tolerability issues were observed.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/30/1812397/0/en/Aptinyx-Reports-Positive-Data-from-Phase-1-Study-of-Novel-NMDA-Receptor-Modulator-NYX-458-in-Healthy-Volunteers.html">the company also reported</a> positive Phase 1 safety results. The study included 62 healthy volunteers were given single and repeat doses of NYX-458 at multiple levels to determine the optimal dose for future Phase 2 studies.</p>
      <p>“We are excited about the potential for NYX-458 to alleviate the cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease,” said Norbert Riedel, Ph.D., president and CEO of Aptinyx.</p>
      <p>The company expects to report topline trial results in the second half of 2021.</p>
