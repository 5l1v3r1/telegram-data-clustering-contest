      <p>Michael Douglas shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B52kYYJhhFi/">photo</a> on Instagram of himself giving Kirk Douglas a kiss on the head. He called his dad, an actor known for <i>The Bad and the Beautiful</i>, <i>Lust for Life</i> and <i>Spartacus</i>, a "living legend" in the caption.</p>
      <p>"Happy birthday Dad! You are a living legend and your entire family sends you all the love in their hearts! #KirkDouglas #103," Michael Douglas wrote.</p>

      <p>"Okay, so he was 100. Big birthday, big birthday. The trouble is, when you're 100, you don't really want a big birthday," Michael Douglas said of his dad. "I threw a big party for him, it was great."</p>
      <p>"101. You know, 'Okay, let's have a nice party.' ... 102 ..." the actor added. "So he's begging me, he's got tears down his eyes. 'Let's just have dinner, the family together. Bring the kids.'"</p>

      <p>"He's incredible. He doesn't get around a whole lot but his mind's all there, so I got him an iPad and I got him FaceTime," Michael Douglas said. "Loves it. It's fantastic."</p>
