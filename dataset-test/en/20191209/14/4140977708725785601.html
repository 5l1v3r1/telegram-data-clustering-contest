          <p>Celtic and Rangers share a great rivalry but the real drama in the game happened off the pitch as 18-year-old right-back Jeremie Frimpong after his side secured Scottish League Cup against Rangers in the finale.</p>
          <p>The 18-year-old saw red for his foul on Alfredo Morelos in the second-half, but Celtic survived Rangers’ onslaught to win at Hampden Park. While speaking with the BT Sport, the young defender replied that he was in a constant panic after being sent off.</p>

                <p>Instantly Frimpong’s post-match interview sent social media into overdrive. Frimpong is a Dutch prodigy and has recently signed a four-year contract with Celtic in September and made debut against Partick Thistle the same month.</p>

                            <p>“I want to be the best player there is. I want to play for the biggest team ever. I want to win the Champions League. I want to hold the World Cup. I want to win as many trophies as I can,” he said.</p>
                            <p>“Look at Virgil Van Dijk, there’s the example. Played for Celtic; four years later he nearly wins the Ballon D’Or at Liverpool. He was so close.</p>
                            <p>“So can I be the best player there is? Yeah, I think I can be. Celtic can help me with that. The history here is crazy. They are so good – one of the biggest teams there is.”</p>
