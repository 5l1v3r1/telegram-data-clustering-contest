      <p>David Klein, the chief financial officer at Canopy's largest shareholder, will replace Mark Zekulin, effective Jan. 14, 2020.</p>
      <p>Klein has been serving as chairman of the board at Canopy, which intends to appoint a new chairman once he takes over as CEO.</p>
      <p>Zekulin is a founding employee at Canopy and has served in a variety of roles including president, co-CEO and finally as CEO after co-founder Bruce Linton was ousted earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Linton's departure came after Constellation said in June that it was "not pleased" with the company's financial results.</p>
      <p>Zekulin is expected to step down as CEO and resign his seat on the board of directors of Canopy effective Dec. 20.</p>
