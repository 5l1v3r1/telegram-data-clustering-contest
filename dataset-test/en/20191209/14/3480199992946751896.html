      <p>A cyclist has brought some festive cheer to the streets of London by pedalling an image of a reindeer.</p>
      <p>Anthony Hoyte, from Cheltenham, creates art by planning intricate routes that form images on maps, then recording his rides using the Strava fitness tracker app.</p>

      <p>And his latest effort – his third annual Christmas image – may be his most impressive yet.</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty happy with it,” the 51-year-old told the PA news agency. “You plan them all out but until you get back and upload it, you’re not quite sure whether it’s going to work or not.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hoyte’s impressive 79-mile route started in Hammersmith in west London, went north as far as Edgware before heading south again and east through Hampstead Heath and Wood Green.</p>
      <p>Finally he returned south through Kilburn and Maida Vale before finishing along Euston Road in central London.</p>

      <p>At nine hours, it pushed him about as far as he can go, even as a regular club cyclist.</p>
      <p>“I live in the countryside and it’s very different to coming into London,” he said. “Particularly around Neasden and Wembley, it’s not the most pleasant cycling.</p>
      <p>“That’s about my maximum distance – I wouldn’t want to go too much above that. It’s a long day in the saddle.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hoyte, a heritage consultant, has produced around a dozen pieces of art on his bike, and believes his training as a product designer helps in the creative process of planning the routes.</p>

      <p>“I just spend a lot of time looking at maps and it’s waiting for things to jump out at you,” he said. “Normally I look at maps until I see something – ‘That looks a bit like a nose’ – so I think ‘Where can I find eyes near that?’</p>
      <p>“It’s like looking at patterns in clouds and seeing pictures.</p>
      <p>“With these ones it’s a bit more tricky because I’m trying to do something festive so it’s harder, but it’s the same process really.”</p>

        <figcaption>Previous routes have included a Yorkshire terrier cycled on the streets of Leeds (Anthony Hoyte/PA)</figcaption>

      <p>Other routes Mr Hoyte has cycled include a Yorkshire terrier in Leeds, two elephants in Birmingham, and a flock of birds in Bristol.</p>
      <p>In 2017 he produced his first festive work by cycling a snowman in London and he followed it up last year with Santa in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>He said: “In a sense I’ve made a rod for my own back in that it’s become a tradition and everyone was saying ‘So what’s it going to be this year?'”</p>
      <p>But in the end, the reindeer turned out almost exactly as planned.</p>

      <p>“There’s a little glitch in there near Shepherd’s Bush where I obviously lost the GPS signal and it creates a straight line that cuts through a couple of street blocks, but that’s minor,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I made a couple of mistakes but they’re so small that nobody’s going to notice really. I’m happy. It looks how I wanted it to look.”</p>
