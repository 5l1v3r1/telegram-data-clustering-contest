      <h1>Nick Saban’s Final Coaches’ Poll Top 25 Ballot Has Been Revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:20:26+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama won’t be heading to the College Football Playoff this postseason. The Crimson Tide aren’t playing in a New Year’s Six game, either.</p>
      <p>Nick Saban’s team, which finished No. 13 in the final College Football Playoff rankings, is playing in the Citrus Bowl against Michigan.</p>
      <p>If Alabama would have finished a couple of spots higher in the final playoff rankings, perhaps they’d be playing in the Sugar Bowl or Orange Bowl.</p>
      <p>Saban had them ranked high enough in his Coaches’ Poll top 25 ballot. Unlike the playoff committee, he had Alabama all the way at No. 5.</p>
      <p>Here’s his final Coaches’ Poll ballot:</p>
      <blockquote>1. LSU<br/>2. Ohio State<br/>3. Clemson<br/>4. Oklahoma<br/>5. Alabama<br/>6. Georgia<br/>7. Florida<br/>8. Auburn<br/>9. Oregon<br/>10. Baylor<br/>11. Wisconsin<br/>12. Penn State<br/>13. Utah<br/>14. Michigan<br/>15. Notre Dame<br/>16. Iowa<br/>17. Memphis<br/>18. Minnesota<br/>19. Boise State<br/>20. Appalachian State<br/>21. Southern Cal<br/>22. Cincinnati<br/>23. Oklahoma State<br/>24. Navy<br/>25. Air Force</blockquote>
