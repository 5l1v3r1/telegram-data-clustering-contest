      <p>The coroner's service and the RCMP are asking for the public's help in identifying a man whose body was found Nov. 1 near Moberly Lake, in Northern B.C.</p>
      <p>The body was discovered in a farmer's field on Boucher Lake Road, about 10 kilometres northeast of the community, which is near Chetwynd.</p>
      <p>The man's death is not considered suspicious and the RCMP believe he died earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The coroner's service says the man was "most likely" under the age of 40 and was about five feet, 11 inches tall.</p>
      <p>He was wearing a camouflage-style shirt, blue "True Religion" brand jeans, and size 11 Nike Air Max running shoes.</p>
