      <h1>Beyonce explains how miscarriages changed her life</h1>
      <h2>'I began to search for deeper meaning when life began to teach me lessons I didn't know I needed'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:36:52+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Mapstone, Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>Beyonce has said that suffering miscarriages and becoming a mother has helped her to become stronger and change her outlook on life.</p>
      <p>The US music star and actress said that success "looks different to me now" and that she no longer focuses on chart positions or awards.</p>
      <p>Beyonce has daughter Blue Ivy, seven, and two-year-old twins Rumi and Sir with husband Jay-Z, and she has previously talked about having a miscarriage two years before her eldest child was born.</p>
      <p>Rapper Jay-Z later appeared to refer to her suffering several miscarriages in his song 4.44 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Beyonce, 38, told Elle UK magazine: "I began to search for deeper meaning when life began to teach me lessons I didn't know I needed. I learned that all pain and loss is in fact a gift.</p>
      <p>"Having miscarriages taught me that I had to mother myself before I could be a mother to someone else.</p>
      <p>"Then I had Blue, and the quest for my purpose became so much deeper."</p>
      <p>The Crazy In Love singer added: "I died and was reborn in my relationship, and the quest for self became even stronger. It's difficult for me to go backwards.</p>
      <p>"Being 'number one' was no longer my priority. My true win is creating art and a legacy that will live far beyond me. That's fulfilling."</p>
      <p>She said that having children and growing older has also changed her opinion on herself, and that she is more than her appearance.</p>
      <p>"If someone told me 15 years ago that my body would go through so many changes and fluctuations, and that I would feel more womanly and secure with my curves, I would not have believed them," she said.</p>
      <p>"But children and maturity have taught me to value myself beyond my physical appearance and really understand that I am more than enough no matter what stage I'm at in life.</p>
      <p>"Giving zero f**** is the most liberating place to be. Also knowing true beauty is something you cannot see. I wish more people focused on discovering the beauty within themselves rather than critiquing other folks' grills."</p>
      <p>Beyonce also said that it has "always been important for me to hire women" at her company Parkwood Entertainment and that "as a woman, if you are too opinionated, too strong-willed, too anything, you are disregarded".</p>
      <p>She said she believes in "giving a voice to people who are not always heard", adding: "One of the first presidents of my company was a woman. My current GM, head of production, head of PR, and other leaders are women.</p>
      <p>"I hire women not to be token voices in the company but to lead. I believe women are more balanced and think with compassion in deciding what's best for the business.</p>
      <p>"They see the big picture absent of personal agendas. Most women are loyal and commit with 100% follow-through."</p>
      <p>The January issue of Elle UK is on sale from December 12.</p>
