      <p>A spokesperson from the cops said: "Police Scotland can confirm that the body of a man was found in water in Dalmuir Park, Clydebank this morning, Monday, December 9.</p>
      <p>"Officers are currently carrying out inquiries into the death and would ask that anyone who may have been in the park, either on Sunday evening or Monday morning, call police on the 101 number if they saw a man walking, who may have had a dog with him.</p>
      <p>"Callers should quote the reference number 1370 9 December 2019."</p>
      <p>The force have locked down the park and it is likely it'll remain closed for the rest of the day.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, forensic officers are <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/5046558/glasgow-death-forensic-body-found-unexplained/">still at the scene of an “unexplained” death two days after a man’s body was found in a Glasgow lane</a>.</p>
      <p>Cops confirmed a 40-year-old man had passed away after they were called to Royal Exchange Court in the city centre on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The alarm was first raised to officers at 9.20am before they then made the grim discovery.</p>
      <p>The scene remains taped off over 48 hours later with police officers still standing guard.</p>
      <p>Photos show forensic officers examining the scene.</p>
      <p>In one snap they appear to be handling evidence.</p>
