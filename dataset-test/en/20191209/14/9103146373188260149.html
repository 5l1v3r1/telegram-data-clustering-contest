        <u>COURT</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>KAMPALA-The Buganda Road Chief Magistrates’ Court has declined dismissing music promoter Andrew Mukasa alias Bajjo’s inciting violence case.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bajjo appeared before the Grade One Magistrate, Marion Mangeni in thought that his case was to be dismissed as earlier stated in the previous court ruling.</p>
      <p>However, Mangeni declined dismissing the case on grounds that the trial Magistrate, Stella Amabilis, who’s handling the case, was indisposed.</p>
      <p>“I cannot dismiss your case for am just holding brief for the trial Magistrate meant to handle it, and she is indisposed per say,” Mangeni said.</p>
      <p>Prior, Bajjo’s lawyer, Erias Lukwago had requested court to dismiss the case alleging that the state had failed to avail witnesses to pin his client, which court accepted to do.</p>
      <p>But Lukwago’s request didn’t go successful as the trial magistrate who was meant to handle the case was indisposed.</p>
      <p>It is then that the state prosecutor, Miriam Njuki requested court to adjourn the case.</p>
      <p>“Due to the absence of the presiding magistrate in this case, I find it necessary to adjourn it to January 13, 2020,” Mangeni ruled.</p>
      <p>The prosecution alleges that during the month of June 2019 in various places such as Masaka, Mbarara, Ibanda and Kampala, Bajjo incited members of the public.</p>
      <p>It is also asserted that in June this year, with intent to disturb the peace and privacy of the president recorded a video and posted it on social media talking of overthrowing the government.</p>
      <p>According to prosecution, Bajjo allegedly used his mobile phone to make the suggestion with no purpose of legitimate communication.</p>
