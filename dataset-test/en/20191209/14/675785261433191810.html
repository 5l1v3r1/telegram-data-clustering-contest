      <h2>EastEnders legend Phil Mitchell vows payback against wife Sharon and son-in-law Keanu Taylor as their affair is exposed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:51:22+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>EastEnders spoilers for the Christmas episodes include some potentially hint-filled promo pictures of the characters involved in dramatic scenes.</p>
      <p>Phil Mitchell will take his revenge on pregnant wife Sharon, who is carrying the baby of their son-in-law Keanu Taylor after a fling.</p>
      <p>The Walford legend is about to uncover the shocking and devastating truth that Sharon's baby is not his - with Keanu, the partner of his daughter Louise, the dad.</p>
      <p>Keanu has just welcomed a baby with Louise, so the entire Mitchell clan will be torn apart as the secret is exposed this Christmas.</p>
      <p>In upcoming scenes, Phil, with the help of son Ben, will go to desperate lengths to find out who the father is.</p>

      <p>Once he knows the truth, all hell breaks loose on Christmas Day, when he puts his revenge plan in motion.</p>
      <p>Lives will never be the same with families torn apart forever, with Phil set to prove he isn't to be messed with.</p>
      <p>While exact details of the episodes and his revenge - not to mention the outcome - are unknown, new spoilers and pictures have teased what is to come.</p>
      <p>The BBC soap has released a number of promo pictures, with Phil, Keanu and Sharon taking centre stage.</p>

      <p>But they're not the only ones facing drama this Christmas, with new shots also hinting at other big plots to unfold.</p>
      <p>Linda and Mick Carter feature in their own gloomy looking picture, with Linda's drinking set to spiral dangerously out of control.</p>
      <p>She'll end up caught up in something over the festive period that leaves her "haunted", hiding a secret from Christmas Day.</p>

      <p>There's also a snap of Ben Mitchell with Martin Fowler, amid their recent dodgy dealings.</p>
      <p>Martin went off the rails after being blackmailed by Ben to do criminal work for him - Ben has since left the world of crime, but does this photo suggest it's not over?</p>
      <p>The fact both men are stood looking pretty villainous together appears to hint they'll be in scenes together.</p>
      <p>Whether that be them committing crime, or whether they're linked to Keanu's exit as fans have predicted, there's no doubt going to be chaos.</p>

      <p>Back to the main event, and there's a number of promo shots teasing Phil's revenge against Sharon and Keanu.</p>
      <p>Sharon looks pretty worried in her own photos, holding her baby bump, while Keanu also seems concerned.</p>
      <p>Hardman Phil looks ready for action, with one particular scene hinting at bloodshed and violence.</p>

      <p>Phil, with Keanu and Sharon either side of him, is seen with a bloodied hand after smashing a bauble in his palm.</p>
      <p>Could this hint at danger or maybe even a shock death as the truth comes out?</p>
      <p>Even the released spoiler pictures tease the scenes, with Phil looking angry in one and then appearing to tearfully have it out with cheating wife Sharon in another.</p>
      <p>Viewers will have to stay tuned for the Christmas trailer and any other spoilers ahead of the big episodes later this month.</p>
