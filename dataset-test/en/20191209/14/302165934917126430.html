      <p>AMSTERDAM, Dec 9 — The Dutch national anti-terrorism agency (NCTV) has downgraded the threat of a terror attack in the Netherlands for the first time since 2013.</p>
      <p>The NCTV said it had reduced the threat level by one notch, to 3 on a scale of 1 to 5, meaning an attack is “conceivable”. The threat of attack had previously been considered “real”.</p>
      <p>“We still see jihadist attacks in the West every now and then”, the NCTV said. “But the situation is incomparable to the 2015-2017 period, when we saw dozens of attacks in Europe every year.”</p>
      <p>Despite this, jihad cells that pose a threat are still active in the Netherlands, the NCTV said.</p>
      <p>Last month, two men were arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of preparing an Islamist militant attack with bomb vests or one or more car bombs. — Reuters</p>
