      <h1>West Brom boss Slaven Bilic's message for Hal Robson-Kanu after starring role against Swansea City</h1>
      <h2>The West Brom winger has spoken of potentially representing Wales again</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:00:59+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Sands</a></address>
      <p>Hal Robson-Kanu's West Brom manager is backing him all the way to make a Wales return in time for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The winger will always be remembered for scoring one of the iconic Euro 2016 goals, helping Wales on their way to beating Belgium 3-1 to make it to the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>The striker retired back in August 2018 aged 29, scoring five goals for his country across 44 games. At the time, he said he had made the decision to dedicate more time to his family and focus on his club career.</p>
      <p>More recently, however, he has opened up about talks to potentially make himself available for Wales, saying: "I've missed international football and you do get that feeling that you can still help the team.</p>
      <p>"It's something I am thinking hard about, we'll see."</p>
      <p>And it seems his club boss is backing him all the way.</p>
      <p>Speaking after West Brom's 5-1 demolition of Swansea City, manager Slaven Bilic said match goalscorer Robson-Kanu "should be" in the Wales squad.</p>

      <p>He <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50707474">told the BBC:</a> "With the greatest respect to Wales players, they qualified so they did a great job.</p>
      <p>"I saw because they were in the same group with Croatia and I like Ryan Giggs so I watched their games.</p>
      <p>"I don't see many players of Hal's quality (in the Wales squad). They are different, but nobody has what Hal has. That's my opinion.</p>
      <p>"I always like my players to play for their international team. It brings them to another level and another motivation and they are basically better players then."</p>
      <p>He even went on to say he had the urge to call Wales boss Ryan Giggs about it personally.</p>
      <p>"Hal is for me a top, top, top player," he added. "That's why he's playing. He contributes a lot to us.</p>
      <p>"Hal is, to me, brilliant. To be fair I even wanted to call Ryan Giggs. Of course they are doing brilliantly.</p>
      <p>"He has done an unbelievable job, but Hal should be there."</p>
