      <h1>Iraq military complex housing US forces slammed by rockets, says army</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:44:00+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Several rockets slammed into an Iraqi military complex that hosts US forces next to Baghdad International Airport on Monday, wounding six Iraqi troops, the military said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Security forces found launchers with rockets that had not been fired properly, indicating a larger attack was planned, the military said.</p>
      <p>It is the latest in an uptick in rocket attacks targeting either Iraqi bases where US troops are located or the US embassy in Baghdad.</p>
      <p>US defence officials have blamed several on Iran-backed factions in Iraq.</p>
      <p>Security sources told AFP that the wounded in Monday’s attack belong to Iraq’s Counter-Terrorism Service, an elite unit that was created and trained by US forces.</p>
      <p>Two of them are in critical condition, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The military complex also hosts a small group of US soldiers and US diplomats.</p>
      <p>There have been at least nine attacks against US targets in Iraq in six weeks.</p>
      <p>There have been no claims of responsibility and no US forces have been wounded.</p>
      <p>Security sources have linked at least one last week to Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful Shiite faction close to Tehran and blacklisted by Washington.</p>
      <p>Iran holds vast sway in Iraq, especially among the more hardline elements of the Hashed al-Shaabi, a security force largely made up of Shiite militias.</p>
      <p>A US defence official told AFP the rocket attacks made the Hashed a bigger security threat to US troops in Iraq than the Islamic State group, the jihadist movement which the US has vowed to help Baghdad wipe out.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the US imposed sanctions on three senior Hashed figures.</p>
      <p>Tensions between Iran and the US have soared since Washington pulled out of a landmark nuclear agreement with Tehran last year and re-imposed crippling sanctions.</p>
      <p>Baghdad – which is close to both countries and whose many security forces have been trained by either the US or Iran – is worried about being caught in the middle.</p>
      <p>US officials say they are considering plans to deploy between 5,000 and 7,000 additional troops to the region to counter its arch-foe Iran.</p>
