      <p>Voters seeking to cast their ballots this week will have to brave the elements, as polling day is forecast to be wet and windy across the country.</p>
      <p>Gusts of up to 30mph will batter Britain on Thursday as the country heads to the polls for the first December General Election in almost 100 years.</p>
      <p>An area of low pressure will bring outbreaks of rain to all parts of the UK throughout the day – with particularly heavy downpours expected to hit the South and South West.</p>
      <p>Snow could fall in mountainous areas of Scotland, while the rest of the country is likely to see temperatures of around 10C to 12C.</p>
      <p>Key battlegrounds in the Midlands will see wet weather from mid-morning, with heavier bursts later in the day.</p>

      <p>The bad weather – coupled with winter’s reduced daylight hours – could lead to a lower voter turnout than the 68.7% achieved in 2017.</p>
      <p>Older people are traditionally more likely to go out and vote, but there are fears the rotten weather could dissuade them.</p>
      <p>Such an event could have a particular effect on the Tories, who typically benefit the most from the grey vote.</p>
      <p>Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge told the PA news agency: “(Thursday) starts off generally dry, with a fairly chilly start, so actually quite a nice start to the day away from the far West.</p>
      <p>“But unfortunately the rain will push in from the West over the morning so it is going to be a wet and windy day.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got an area of low pressure moving across the UK on Thursday which will bring outbreaks of rain to all parts through the day – locally heavy at times, particularly down towards the West and the South West, particularly in areas of higher ground.</p>
      <p>“It will be fairly windy as well, so we could see winds around 20mph – some gusts a little bit stronger than that, up to 30mph or so.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s not going to be the nicest of days to be outside.”</p>
