      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has saved the best for last, at least in terms of its pay-per-view (PPV) offerings, with this Sat. night’s (Dec. 14, 2019) UFC 245 “Usman vs. Covington” extravaganza from inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, topped by three championship title fights.</p>
      <p>The UFC 245 main event features the first welterweight title defense for Kamaru Usman after capturing the 170-pound strap from Tyron Woodley back in March. He’ll battle division loudmouth and streaking No. 1 contender, Colby Covington.</p>
      <p>Before those two can hook ‘em up, reigning featherweight champion, Max Holloway, will put his 145-pound title on the line against Aussie superstar Alexander Volkanovski, who hasn’t seen the loss column in nearly seven years.</p>
      <p>In addition, women’s bantamweight champion, Amanda Nunes, who is being called the greatest female fighter of all time, gives Dutch kickboxing champion, Germaine De Randamie, her crack at the 135-pound crown after coming up short in 2013.</p>
