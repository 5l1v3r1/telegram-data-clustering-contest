      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a> Galaxy S11+ battery capacity has been <a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/dit-is-de-5000-mah-batterij-van-de-samsung-galaxy-s11-plus/">revealed</a> by <a href="http://www.safetykorea.kr/release/certificationsearch">SafetyKorea</a>, South Korean certification database. A Samsung-branded battery certification has been spotted, along with a photo of the battery itself.</p>
      <p>This battery surfaced with the model number 'EB-BG988ABY'. As you can see, it matches with a model number 'SM-G988', which stands for the Galaxy S11+. This pretty much confirms that the Galaxy S11+ will include a 5,000mAh battery.</p>
      <h3>The Galaxy S11+ battery capacity to stand at 5,000mAh</h3>
      <p>If this info ends up being true, this will be the largest battery Samsung has ever placed in one of its flagships. This battery's typical capacity is 5,000mAh, while its rated capacity is 4,855mAh, in case you were wondering.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This battery is manufactured by Samsung SDI in Vietnam. The Galaxy S11+ will need such a large battery, as the phone is rumored to feature a 6.9-inch display. That's not all, though, as that display is said to sport a high refresh rate of 120Hz.</p>
      <p>This is a huge boost over the Galaxy S10+'s panel. That handset has a 6.4-inch QHD+ display, with a 60Hz refresh rate. Needless to say, the Galaxy S11+'s panel will be a lot more demanding in terms of battery.</p>
      <p>Chances are that Samsung also plans to include 45W fast charging in the Galaxy S11+, as the Galaxy Note 10+ supports it. A Chinese certification listing did confirm the existence of 25W wired charging for the Galaxy S11+, along with 5G, soâ€¦ Samsung may stick to 25W only. We'll see.</p>

      <p>The device is expected to launch with its siblings in February, prior to the MWC. Samsung is expected to announce the Galaxy S11, and S11e along with the 'Plus' model.</p>
      <h3>The S11+ will be the largest S11-branded handset</h3>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S11+ will be the largest out of those three phones, and chances are it will arrive in both 4G and 5G variants. The device will be made out of metal and glass, just like its siblings.</p>
      <p>You can expect to see a centered display camera hole on the front of the device. The Galaxy S11+ will also have a curved display, and it will probably be slippery.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Samsung will be making a change to a 20:9 display aspect ratio with the Galaxy S11 series, quite probably. That is why Samsung has opted to enlarge display size, even though the device will be taller than ever before.</p>
      <p>The company is also rumored to announce the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite in the near future. Those two phones are expected to arrive by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 series is expected to bring some significant improvement in the camera department. At least the Galaxy S11+ will sport Samsung's new, custom 108-megapixel camera on the back. If a recent rumor is to be believed, that is.</p>
