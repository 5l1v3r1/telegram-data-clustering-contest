      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Doctors have recommended former premier Nawaz Sharif to refer to the medical experts in the U.S. as 88 per cent passage of an artery supplying blood to his brain has been blocked, according to Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb.</p>
      <p>The PML-N spokesperson, in her talk to the media, stated that medical complications pertaining to Nawaz Sharif’s health could be serious, and so instead of taking any risk, the doctors have recommended contacting medical experts in the U.S.</p>
      <p>She further told that doctors might use electromagnetic radiation to examine internal organs of the ailing party supremo.</p>
      <p>Ms Aurangzeb said beside the performance of the incompetent government, its mental state has also been reduced.</p>
      <p>“Mentally paralysed [persons] are doing politics over Nawaz Sharif’s health,” she said.</p>
