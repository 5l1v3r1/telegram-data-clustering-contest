      <p>Elon Musk took Tesla's new Cybertruck out for a spin in Los Angeles on Saturday. During his drive, he took out a traffic pylon and made some other questionable driving decisions.</p>
      <p>A video <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-hits-traffic-pylon-with-new-cybertruck-after-1840307783">published by TMZ</a> showed the billionaire mowing down a "right turn only" sign while turning left out of Nobu, a sushi restaurant in Malibu.</p>
      <p>To be sure, the sign did not appear to be on the road and instead seemed to be private traffic management for the restaurant's parking lot, given that the driveway is next to a traffic light. In the video, the light turns green for cross-traffic as Musk exits the parking lot.</p>

      <p>A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>This appeared to be the Cybertruck's first voyage out on public roads following <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">the electric pickup's unveiling</a> in late November. A YouTube user named Roberto Cruz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPrcl5f4rhU&amp;feature=youtu.beu.be">posted a video</a> on Saturday evening of the mirrorless truck spotted on the 405 Freeway.</p>
      <p>The truck appeared to have manufacturer license plates, which, <a href="https://thedriven.io/2019/12/09/video-elon-musk-driving-tesla-cybertruck-on-public-roads-in-la/">according to The Driven</a>, can be used for testing.</p>
      <p>Nobu seemed to be more of a celebration for Musk following <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wins-defamation-trial-over-pedo-guy-tweet-2019-12">his win in a defamation suit</a> brought by the diver he called a "pedo guy" on Twitter last year.</p>
