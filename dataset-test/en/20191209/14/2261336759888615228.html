      <p>I think it was on the Heavy Hands podcast that one of the hosts said that Alistair Overeem has been knocked out so many times that it has humbled him and that sentiment echoed when <a href="https://twitter.com/Alistairovereem/status/1203577518206443520">I read his first tweet</a> after the fight against Jairzinho Rozenstruik. As for the artwork, I thought about how the doc was going to stitch up Overeem’s face and remembered a panel from a comic I liked as a teenager, <a href="https://www.throwbacks.com/content/images/2017/07/Spawn-gets-a-Batarang-to-the-face.jpg">Spawn vs Batman</a></p>
      <p>Anyway, it’s great to be back watching fights and I’m hyped for UFC 245. As a cartoonist I’m kinda looking forward to Colby... <i>winning? A</i>lso, has anyone noticed that the “ugly” marketing we were all warned about leading up to Covington vs Usman hasn’t happened?</p>
      <p>We have a big week ahead, maybe it’ll be a classic MMA dumpster fire. Take care of yourself and I’ll talk to you tomorrow.</p>
