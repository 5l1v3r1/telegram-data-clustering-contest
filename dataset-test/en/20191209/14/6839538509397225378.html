      <p>New Zealand police do not expect to find any more survivors of a volcanic eruption on White Island that killed at least five people.</p>
      <p>“No signs of life have been seen at any point,” police said in a statement after rescue helicopters and other aircraft carried out a number of reconnaissance flights over the island following the eruption on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Police believe that anyone who could have been taken from the island alive was rescued at the time of the evacuation,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>Australians are believed to be among the visitors on Whakaari from a nearby cruise ship, the Ovation of the Seas, which originated in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Up to 50 people were on or near the island when the eruption took place.</p>
      <p>As many as 27 people may have been left stranded, with their condition unknown.</p>
      <p>“Australians have been caught up in this terrible event and we are working to determine their wellbeing,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison tweeted.</p>

      <p>“I have been in touch with (New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern) to offer our full support with whatever they need and our authorities are working closely together.”</p>
      <p>The resultant ash plume has created conditions too dangerous for access.</p>
      <p>Emergency will attempt to reach the island as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>
      <p>Several people suffering from injuries, including burns, are being treated in nearby Whakatane Hospital and Middlemore Hospital.</p>
      <p>They are among 23 people to have made it away from the island in time.</p>
      <p>Ardern rushed to nearby Whakatane on Monday night, where expectations are grim.</p>
      <p>“I know there will be a huge amount of anxiety for those who have loved ones on or around the island at the time. I can assure them police are doing everything they can,” Ardern said.</p>
      <p>Ardern said those on the island were a mix of Kiwis and overseas visitors.</p>
      <p>Royal Caribbean, owner of the cruise ship, issued a statement saying the ship would stay in the nearby port of Tauranga overnight “until we learn more about the situation”.</p>
      <p>The island is frequently visited by tourists as part of organised boat tours from Whakatane.</p>
      <p>Geological hazard trackers GeoNet had registered moderate volcanic unrest on the island for weeks.</p>
      <p>But the nature of volcano activity is unpredictable, with the eruption unforeseen by authorities.</p>

      <p>A GeoNet camera of the crater’s rim, set to take pictures every 10 minutes, showed a string of people visiting the crater at 2.10pm.</p>
      <p>The next shot taken, at 2.20pm, was unreadable as the blast had rendered the camera inoperable.</p>
      <p>Aviation meteorologists have issued an “orange” volcanic ash advisory, which reflects the potential to affect nearby flights.</p>
      <p>Police have also advised nearby residents to be aware of the potential for ashfall from the eruption.</p>
      <p>By 3pm AEDT, GeoNet had reduced the alert level from four to three, noting a “steady decline in activity since the eruption”.</p>
