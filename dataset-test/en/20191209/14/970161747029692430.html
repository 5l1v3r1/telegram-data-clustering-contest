      <h1>Don't ask Beyonce is she's pregnant: 'Get off my ovaries'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:35:03+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Kelly</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/beyonce-knowles/">Beyonce</a> is constantly plagued by pregnancy rumours <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/27/beyonce-addresses-pregnancy-rumours-cheeky-belly-rub-7769303/">every time she touches her stomach or eats a bowl of pasta.</a></p>
      <p>And the mum-of-three is sick of everyone asking if she has another bun in the oven.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old has revealed the question she hates most is â€˜Are you pregnant?â€™ â€“ and has a killer response to anyone asking it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29999871/beyonce-ivy-park-adidas-interview/">Speaking to Elle,</a> Queen Bey said: â€˜Get off my ovaries!â€™</p>
      <p>Yep, weâ€™re gonna need that embroidered on a t-shirt, stat.</p>

      <p>Beyonce has three children with husband Jay Z â€“ Blue Ivy, seven, and two-year-old twins Rumi and Sir.</p>
      <p>The star also suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage before welcoming Blue, and she addressed how the tragedy changed her.</p>
      <p>The Formation singer said: â€˜I learned that all pain and loss is in fact a gift. Having miscarriages taught me that I had to mother myself before I could be a mother to someone else.</p>

      <p>â€˜Then I had Blue, and the quest for my purpose became so much deeper. I died and was reborn in my relationship, and the quest for self became even stronger.â€™</p>
      <p>In the rare interview, Beyonce â€“ who is launching a new range with Ivy Park in January â€“ answered questions submitted by fans, and amidst her answers, the legend revealed that while she hates being asked about the contents of her womb, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/09/beyonce-admits-giving-zero-fs-about-weight-gain-as-she-opens-up-in-rare-interview-11491243/">she brushes off critique of her body.</a></p>
      <p>The Lion King star said: â€˜If someone told me 15 years ago that my body would go through so many changes and fluctuations, and that I would feel more womanly and secure with my curves, I would not have believed them.</p>
      <p>â€˜But children and maturity have taught me to value myself beyond my physical appearance and really understand that I am more than enough no matter what stage Iâ€™m at in life.</p>
      <p>â€˜Giving zero ðŸ¤¬s is the most liberating place to be.â€™</p>
      <p>Say it louder for the people in the back!</p>
