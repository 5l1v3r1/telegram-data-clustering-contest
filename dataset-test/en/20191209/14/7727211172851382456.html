      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:31:16+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>Serial rapist Joseph McCann has been given 33 life sentences with a minimum term of 30 years, after his monstrous attacks on women and children.</p>
      <p>McCann embarked on a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/fugitive-joseph-mccann-charged-kidnap-16242385">fortnight of terror</a> where he kidnapped, raped and sexually abused multiple victims around the country.</p>
      <p>His youngest victim was an 11-year-old boy, while his oldest was a 71-year-old woman.</p>
      <p>The law finally caught up with the 34-year-old from Harrow, west London, when police found him hiding <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/arrested-fugitive-being-investigated-over-16233938">in between branches up a tree</a> in Cheshire <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-serial-rapist-joseph-mccann-21056076">- reports Mirror Online.</a></p>
      <p>Today, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/man-arrested-after-hiding-tree-16231599">violent thug McCann</a> received his sentencing at the Old Bailey. He did not appear in court or by video link because he said he had a "bad back".</p>
      <p>Judge Mr Justice Edis described him as "highly dangerous", a “classic psychopath”, a "violent bully" and a "paedophile".</p>

      <p>McCann's sentencing comes days after a jury found him guilty of 37 counts, including rape, kidnap and false imprisonment.</p>
      <p>In a statement read this afternoon, one of his 11 victims described how she has "gone from a life of thriving to surviving."</p>
      <p>After the trial, one detective described McCann as "one of the most dangerous individuals that we've ever seen."</p>
      <p>The convicted burglar had been freed after a probation error before he went on a cocaine and vodka-fuelled rampage, in Watford, London and the North West.</p>
      <p>McCann claimed to have had consensual sex with some of his victims and denied all the charges.</p>
      <p>During his sex attack spree, he changed his appearance and moved across five police force areas as he evaded officers for 15 days despite telling his first victim his surname.</p>

      <p>On his arrest, he told police: "If you had caught me for the first two, the rest of this wouldn't have happened."</p>
      <p>The court heard how two months after his release, in the early hours of April 21, McCann snatched a young woman from the street in Watford and raped her in her bed.</p>
      <p>The woman reported the attack to police, McCann's details were put on the Police National Computer and a prison recall was issued.</p>
      <p>But McCann remained at large and on April 25 he abducted a 25-year-woman as she walked home from work in Walthamstow, east London, just after midnight and subjected her to a 14-hour rape ordeal.</p>
      <p>McCann made her call him "daddy" and say that she was a child.</p>
      <p>Hours later, he was caught on CCTV bundling another young woman into his car in north London, as her sister ran off screaming.</p>
      <p>The two captives escaped outside the Phoenix Lodge in Watford, after the 25-year-old woman hit McCann over the head with a vodka bottle.</p>

      <p>She told jurors she was determined to survive and used her "logic" to seize her chance to incapacitate him.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police circulated a CCTV image of McCann at the Phoenix Hotel and received a tip-off with his name following a public appeal.</p>
      <p>On May 5, McCann tricked his way into the home of a woman he met in a bar in Greater Manchester, tied her up and molested her children, aged 17 and 11.</p>
      <p>The teenage girl, who described McCann as "evil", jumped out of a first floor window to alert police.</p>
      <p>As McCann ran out after her, the 11-year-old boy cut his mother free, saying: "Mum, mum, we are safe. (My sister) saved us."</p>
      <p>Later that day, McCann pounced on a 71-year-old woman loading shopping in her car outside a Morrisons supermarket.</p>
      <p>He raped her before he abducted and assaulted a 13-year-old girl in her car before they got away.</p>
      <p>As police closed in, McCann forced two 14-year-old girls into the car by threatening to "chop them up" with a machete.</p>
      <p>He was captured on CCTV buying condoms at a service station before he was spotted by a patrol car, which gave chase.</p>

      <p>Jurors were shown dramatic dashcam footage of police chasing the rapist as he reached speeds of up to 60mph and veered into the wrong lane of traffic to overtake a car in Congleton, Cheshire, on May 5.</p>
      <p>The Fiat drove the wrong way through a roundabout, crashed into a Mercedes and sped into a neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>McCann eventually abandoned the car, leaving the two "terrified" girls behind, and dashed through a garden before taking a bicycle.</p>
      <p>Later, he was caught in a taxi at a police road block, but he ran off into a field, having changed into a wet T-shirt snatched from a clothes line.</p>
      <p>A police helicopter finally located him up a tree, he was coaxed down and arrested early on May 6.</p>
      <p>McCann refused to attend his trial, but appeared by video link from prison.</p>
      <p>The judge refused ruling that McCann had no real intention to come to court.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Katherine Goodwin, who led the investigation, said after the verdict: "From the moment of his first offence, McCann did everything he could not to be caught and had changed his appearance, given false names and used different cars in order to evade the law.</p>
      <p>"Added to that, he had been assisted by a number of people who knew where he was - and that police were looking for him - who decided to help him remain at large and free to attack again.</p>
      <p>"Despite these extensive efforts, the work of our dedicated officers and their unwavering commitment to getting justice for each and every victim in this case means he will never again be able to inflict this kind of pain and distress."</p>
      <p>CPS prosecutor Tetteh Turkson said in a statement: "Joseph McCann behaved with shocking depravity. He preyed on women and young children with regard only for himself.</p>
      <p>"His victims endured horrifying acts of sexual violence and were subjected to a truly terrifying ordeal.</p>
      <p>"It was through persistence and bravery that some of them managed to escape.</p>
      <p>"They showed great strength of character in recounting their stories to police and giving evidence to the court - reliving some of what must have been the darkest moments of their lives.</p>
      <p>"It is with the power of this evidence, and the courage of the victims in giving evidence, that Joseph McCann has been convicted of his crimes.</p>
      <p>"I hope today's verdicts provide some comfort to the victims and allows them to focus on moving on and rebuilding their lives."</p>
