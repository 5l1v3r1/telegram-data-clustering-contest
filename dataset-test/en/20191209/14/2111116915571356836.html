      <p>These Xbox One deals have just hit store shelves in a post-Cyber week frenzy of fantastic discounts and cheap gaming. You can save $150 on some of the most powerful gaming machines around today. Whether you're looking for an Xbox One S deal for a quick saving on a new console, or you've had your eye on a few Xbox One X deals for a while, these savings can get you straight in the game for less. These savings are seeing fantastic recent games bundled with each console as well as some impressive extra controllers or added bonuses across the US and UK. </p>
      <p>So which Xbox One deal do you go for? </p>
      <p>The Xbox One S is the standard version of the Xbox console. The One S grants you access to the Xbox library and a decent spec worthy of its current-gen standing. If you're looking to play some exclusives you missed this generation, or simply want to expand your collection for the cheapest price possible, now is the time to do so. </p>
      <p>The Xbox One X, on the other hand, is Microsoft's most powerful console to date. Running in 4K HDR with Dolby Atmos spatial audio, you're getting a premier gaming experience for your cash. You may be looking to upgrade your One S, or simply grab a beast of a machine straight from the off. The specs inside the Xbox One X make it buttery smooth and mean it can handle intense 4K resolution with fantastic ease, but that's also thanks to its 12GB of GDDR5 graphic memory. You're getting speedier load times, high-performance cooling, and enhanced gameplay with this beast of a console. </p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-project-scarlett">Project Scarlett</a> on the horizon, these Xbox One deals are rapidly shifting in price to grab those final few gamers before the new console takes over. That's not to say you're going to be abandoning your console in a year's time. With Game Pass and the rate of uptake on newer consoles to consider, you'll likely get a few years of use out of the library already set up for Xbox. </p>
