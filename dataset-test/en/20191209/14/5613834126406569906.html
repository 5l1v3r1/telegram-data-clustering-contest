      <h1>2K Games Announces Existence of New ‘BioShock’ Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:12:47+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>While we’re waiting on news of <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3596255/resident-evil-3-remakes-box-art-discovered-features-redesigned-jill-carlos-nemesis/">you-know-what</a>, another long-awaited sequel has been announced: <b><i>BioShock</i></b>. Yes, those rumours from a <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3493506/2k-reportedly-working-new-bioshock-game/">few years back</a> have been given a dose of reality, courtesy of <a href="https://ca.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber">IGN</a>.</p>
      <p>IGN has been in contact with Kelley Gilmore, who has worked at 2K’s Firaxis Games for nearly two decades. According to Gilmore, he will be heading up a newly formed internal studio named Cloud Chamber, with locations in both Novato, California and Montreal, Quebec, to focus on the development of the new <i>BioShock</i>. They take over from Irrational Games, which has shifted focus to narrative games.</p>
      <p>However, don’t expect this new game in the near future. According to 2K’s announcement, the next <i>BioShock</i> will be in development “for the next several years.” 2K has not officially announced any platforms nor a release date for this new entry. As far as development goes, Gilmore said the team is at “the earlier end of our process”. In addition, Gilmore also declined to say whether the new <i>BioShock</i> would function as a direct sequel in the series or as a reboot, instead referring to it as “the next iteration in the <i>BioShock</i> franchise.”</p>
      <p>The last <i>BioShock</i> game was 2013’s <b><i>BioShock: Infinite</i></b>, although the last major release in the franchise was <i>BioShock: The Collection</i>, which collected the first three games in the franchise in one package.</p>
