      <p>A police officer in Maryland is being held without bail after being charged with multiple counts of rape, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Baltimore County Police Officer Anthony Michael Westerman, 25, has been charged with two counts of second-degree rape and three counts of second-degree assault, department officials announced Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The allegations made in this case are reprehensible and are not representative of the values and ethics of the Baltimore County Police Department,” Police Chief Melissa Hyatt said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Details of the accusations facing Westerman – who has been suspended without pay – were not immediately clear. A message seeking comment from police was not returned early Monday.</p>
      <p>The six-year veteran was last assigned to the department’s Essex precinct. An investigation into the allegations was launched after police received a tip, department officials said.</p>
      <p>The alleged attacks took place in October 2017 and June 2019, <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/breaking-baltimore-county-police-officer-charged-with-rape-anthony-michael-westerman/30160728">WBAL reported.</a></p>
      <p>Westerman is scheduled to appear for a bail hearing Monday afternoon, according to the station.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if Westerman, who remains in custody at the Baltimore County Detention Center, has hired an attorney. His preliminary hearing has been set for Jan. 3, the Baltimore Sun reported.</p>
