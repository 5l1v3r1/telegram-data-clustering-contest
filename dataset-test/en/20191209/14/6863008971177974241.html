      <p>Russia was banned from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled to punish it for manipulating laboratory data, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>WADA's executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sport-doping-russia/russia-banned-from-olympics-for-four-years-over-doping-scandal-tass-idUSKBN1YD0XY?il=0">Reuters </a>wrote.</p>
      <p>Earlier, WADA said Russia should be hit with a four-year Olympic <a href="https://www.unian.info/world/10768358-reuters-wada-committee-recommends-four-year-russia-olympic-ban.html">ban </a>and barred from all world championships for the manipulation of data retrieved from a tainted Moscow laboratory.</p>
