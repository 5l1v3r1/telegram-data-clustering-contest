      <p>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday announced that Mexican senators have accepted the proposed changes to theÂ United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade agreement, per Reuters.</p>
      <p>"We are now waiting for the United States to make the next move," Obrador added. "Now is the right time to decide on the USMCA."</p>
      <p>These comments seem to be helping the MXN gather strength against its major rivals. As of writing, the USD/MXN pair was down 0.25% on the day at 19.2535.</p>
