      <p>Wonder Woman herself is shedding some light on her recent <a href="https://www.cbr.com/wonder-womans-gal-gadot-releasethesnydercut/">Snyder Cut support</a>.</p>
      <p>In an interview with CinéPop for <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>, star Gal Gadot was asked about her feelings regarding Zack Snyder's director's cut of 2017's <i>Justice League </i>-- a project Gadot and her <i>Justice League</i> costars <a href="https://www.cbr.com/ben-affleck-batman-justice-league-snyder-cut-tweet/">Ben Affleck</a> and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-jason-momoa-snyder-cut-photo/">Jason Momoa</a> recently showed support for with the #ReleasetheSnyderCut hashtag. Admitting that the movie suffered from "unfortunate" and "sad circumstances," Gadot explained, "I would have loved to see the finished cut of [Zack's], and I hope that one day we'll get to see it, but I don't know."</p>

      <p>Of particular interest is that both Gadot and <i>Wonder Woman</i> director Patty Jenkins revealed they haven't seen the Snyder Cut, which only fuels the ongoing debate over whether the edit even exists. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/zack-snyder-justice-league-cut-photo-evidence/">Zack Snyder himself</a> has shared apparent photographic evidence that it does, while <a href="https://screenrant.com/justice-league-movie-snyder-cut-hide-bigger/">Warner Bros.</a> has been vague and slightly dismissive about the idea. Fans, meanwhile have speculated about its existence since the production of the film was taken over in its late stages by Joss Whedon.</p>
      <p>Gadot's support for the director's cut has precedent, as it was Snyder who originally cast her in the iconic Wonder Woman role for 2015's <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. </i>Gadot was considered a critical standout in a film that received otherwise negative reactions before taking center stage in 2017's massively successful <i>Wonder Woman.</i></p>
      <p>Directed by Patty Jenkins, <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i> stars Gal Gadot as Diana, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Kristen Wiig as Barbara Minerva/Cheetah, Pedro Pascal and Natasha Rothwell. The film opens on June 5, 2020.</p>
