      <h2>Cars in Arab neighborhood of Shuafat in Jerusalem vandalized with anti-Arab slogans, have their tires slashed.</h2>

      <p>More than 160 cars were vandalized in a predominantly Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem with anti-Arab slogans scrawled nearby, Israeli police said Monday, in a suspected hate crime.</p>
      <p>The cars in the Shuafat neighborhood of east Jerusalem had their tires slashed, with slogans such as "Arabs=enemies", "There is no room in the country for enemies" and "When Jews are stabbed we aren't silent" scrawled in Hebrew with red paint nearby, photos published by Israeli media showed.</p>
      <p>Police said their forces "continue to search the area for the suspects who fled the scene."</p>
      <p>A local official told public broadcaster <i>Kan</i> that footage revealed the vandalism took place overnight under the cover of the rain, and that the perpetrators were religious Jews.</p>
      <p>The incident bore the hallmark of a "price tag" attack, a euphemism for Jewish nationalist-motivated crimes that generally target Arab Israeli property in revenge for terror attacks against Israelis.</p>
      <p>"Three masked settlers sneaked into the neighborhood early and damaged the tyres of cars on the main street," said Maysa Abu Khdair, a resident whose car was targeted and whose surveillance cameras caught the scene.</p>
      <p>"My daughter went on foot to school in the rain," she added.</p>
