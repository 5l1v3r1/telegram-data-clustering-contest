        <b>If all goes well, you will see Taapsee Pannu essaying the lead role in the Hindi remake of the German flick, Run Lola Run</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last year, it was reported that Tanuj Garg and Atul Kasbekar, heads of Ellipsis Entertainment have purchased rights to the German cult film called Run Lola Run.</p>
      <p>This film is a female-centric project and the story revolves around the life of a woman who just has 20 minutes to come up with a huge sum of money in a short span of time to save her boyfriend.</p>

      <p>Kasbekar and Garg were looking for a strong female lead and now, we have heard that they are in advanced talks with Taapsee Pannu. No two second thoughts that Taapsee is a very strong actress and she has proved her mettle with some fab performances in many films.</p>
      <p>The modalities are fast being worked out. Let’s see if Taapsee indeed signs on the dotted line.</p>

      <p>The original German flick starred Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu, Herbert Knaup among many others. The film was selected in the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but didn’t get nominated.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Taapsee Pannu has had a good year with films like Badla, Mission Mangal and Saand Ki Aankh. The actor even bagged the Best Actor Critics Choice Choice award along with Bhumi Pednekar for her performance in Saand Ki Aankh.</p>
