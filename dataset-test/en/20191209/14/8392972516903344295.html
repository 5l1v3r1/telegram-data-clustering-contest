      <h1>ITV sets record straight on I'm A Celebrity... final viewing figures</h1>
      <h2>Reports claimed it was 2.5million down on last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:17:34+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>Viewing figures for the final of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> were reportedly down by well over one million in comparison to last year's finale.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/im-a-celeb-final-falls-25m-short-of-2019/5145496.article">Broadcast</a> article claimed that viewing figures for the last episode in the series, which saw former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress Jacqueline Jossa <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jac-jossa-crowned-jungle-queen/">crowned Queen of the Jungle</a>, came in at 9.1million.</p>
      <p>That figure's almost 2.5million down on the 11.5million recorded for the 2018 series when football manager Harry Redknapp won, the publication reported.</p>

      <p>But a spokesperson for ITV told ED! that the audience figure for the final actually peaked at 10million, putting it roughly 1.5million down on 2018.</p>
      <p>Averages for the series as a whole reportedly stood at 9.1million.</p>
      <p>They continued: "The final was the second biggest audience this series, beaten only by the launch episode. At its peak, the final was watched by three quarters of young people [75%] with 2.5million seeing the show's climax, while the average across the programme for the 16-34 age group was 66% and 2.2million.</p>
      <aside>The final was the second biggest audience this series, beaten only by the launch episode.</aside>
      <p>"With consolidated viewing that takes in catch up viewing, so far across the series, I'm A Celebrity [saw] an average of 10.7million TV viewers with a 42% share have watched the show.</p>
      <p>"An additional 0.5million viewers have been watching on Non TV devices, taking the total average audience up to 11.2million viewers."</p>

      <p>The final episode in this year's I'm A Celebrity made for emotional viewing, as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> star Andy Whyment grew tearful as he expressed his gratitude for all the support he received.</p>
      <p>And when Jac received her laurel crown, she struggled with emotion and pushed through tears to thank friends, family and fans for having her back.</p>
      <p>The result left some viewers divided though, with many annoyed that Andy wasn't crowned the winner.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Others, however, felt Jac was well and truly deserving of the jungle crown - especially since her final Bushtucker Trial was so brutal.</p>
      <p>Andy had to eat a handful of horrible dishes, including part of a camel's hoof and a pig's testicle, while Roman was buried alive in a box filled with snakes.</p>
      <p>But Jacqueline was tied down in a star-shaped container and covered with insects. Later in the trial, she had to endure having hunstman spiders crawling all over her body - and even held one in her mouth for a full minute.</p>
      <p>Some felt the challenge was far too harsh, slamming ITV and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celeb-itv-of-torture-during-final-trials/">branding the trial 'literal torture'</a>.</p>
