      <p>EAST FLATBUSH, Brooklyn (WABC) -- An off-duty officer is due in court after he was arrested and charged in a deadly two-car crash in Brooklyn. The father of the woman killed in the crash is now speaking out about his pain.</p>
      <p>It happened <a href="https://abc7ny.com/off-duty-police-officer-faces-manslaughter-charge-in-deadly-brooklyn-crash/5740739/">early Sunday morning</a> at East 55th and Foster Avenue in East Flatbush.</p>
      <p>A black Mazda SUV was T-boned by a high-end Nissan GTR driven by 47-year-old off-duty NYPD Officer Rohan Shaw.</p>
      <p>He's now charged with vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, a speed violation and driving while ability impaired, which is a lesser charge than DWI.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Mazda SUV took off.</p>
      <p>A 22-year-old woman in the SUV was taken to Kings County Hospital in serious condition and another passenger, 23-year-old Joanna Dixon died.<br/>Dixon was out celebrating her birthday. Her father is distraught.</p>
      <p>"Pain, pain," said Collin Dixon, Joanna's father. "I wish she were here, but we'll get through it."</p>
      <p>He's still processing the sudden and tragic death of his daughter.</p>
      <p>"So she was celebrating with her friends. Her stop was going to be the last stop," Collin Dixon said.</p>
      <p>The York College student never made it home. Her friend remains hospitalized.</p>
      <p>The young man that was behind the wheel of the Mazda allegedly ran a stop sign and fled the scene.</p>
      <p>Joanna's father called him a "coward" and he had this to say to the cop, now facing a list of charges.</p>
      <p>"You're still alive and my daughter's dead. And we can't bring her back. And it's painful, really painful. But God will see us through. I trust God and he will see us through," he said.</p>
      <p>Friends and family left candles and flowers at the scene to remember her.</p>
      <p>Shaw is due in court in Brooklyn later Monday.</p>
