      <h1>Lizzo Twerks In A Thong At LA Lakers Game And Sparks Controversy — See The Revealing Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-09T14:48:16+00:00">09 Dec 2019, 14:48</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>Is Lizzo going too far with her message of body-confidence? Some say yes after she twerked in a thong and revealed a good portion of her backside at the LA Lakers game. Some are saying that what Lizzo does on Instagram or in her shows is one thing, but twerking and revealing your derriere at a family-oriented sports game is simply inappropriate. Others are praising the “Juice” singer for embracing her full-figure and putting it on full display for all to see. Others are saying children should not be exposed to Lizzo’s rear end when they are watching a basketball game.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred on Sunday evening when the LA Lakers were playing the Minnesota Timberwolves. The game took place in Los Angeles and Lizzo was court-side and watching the game when all of a sudden, the Laker Girls started doing their thing to Lizzo’s hit song “Juice.”</p>
      <p>As if taken a clue, Lizzo stood up and appeared to be wearing a typical dress, but the back of the dress had a huge hole cut out exposing her buttocks and thong. At this point, Lizzo dropped down and began twerking.</p>
      <p>Those around whipped out their cellphones and began filming. Everyone saw Lizzo and now the story is going viral where it is sparking as much controversy and outrage as it is praise.</p>
      <p>Lizzo has been nominated for eight Grammy-awards, more than anyone else in 2019.</p>
      <p>You may see the video of Lizzo twerking in her thong at the LA Lakers game in the video player below.</p>

      <p>The controversy isn’t limited to video footage of Lizzo at the LA Lakers game, but extends to all of her social media platforms. Lizzo is proud of her plus size body and has uploaded multiple photos of her in carefully covered, yet nude positions on her social media.</p>
      <p>Some are in favor of the exploits as a message of feminism, self-love and a rebuke to body shaming and even fat-shaming.</p>
      <p>Others are saying that as a plus-size, black woman, Lizzo should hold herself to a very high standard since she has already reached the pinnacle of success.</p>
      <p>What do you think?</p>
      <p>Do you think Lizzo has gone too far or do you commend her for twerking in her thong at the LA Lakers game?</p>
