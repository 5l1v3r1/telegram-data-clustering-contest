      <p>As per the CFTC data for the week between 27 Nov-3 Dec, the New Zealand dollar net speculative positions dropped by 13% of open interest, and is now at -38%, points out Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“This move was widely expected as short-positions had previously held up surprisingly well, despite the mounting NZD momentum.”</p>
      <p>“NZD remains the biggest G10 short amongst speculative investors as well as the only currency whose positioning falls outside the +/1 standard deviation band around its 5-year average. All of this suggests there is still some room for additional NZD short squeezing, which may continue to support the currency ahead.”</p>
      <p>“The AUD net positioning also moved into less negative territory (+5% in the reference week), but a percentage of open interest remains around half of the shorts built-in NZD.”</p>
