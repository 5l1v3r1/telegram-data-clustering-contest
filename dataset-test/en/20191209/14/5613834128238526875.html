        <i>“There hasn’t been a ghost sighting in thirty years…”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The official trailer for<b> Jason Reitman</b>‘s <b><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i></b> has been unleashed this morning, confirming the storyline of this 35-years-later sequel to the original classic.</p>
      <p><b>Carrie Coon</b> is playing the daughter of the late Egon Spengler, with <b>Finn Wolfhard</b> and <b>Mckenna Grace</b> as the grandchildren who will become the next generation of busters!</p>
      <p>The original film’s cast does not appear in the trailer, but it has been confirmed that <b>Bill Murray</b>, <b>Dan Aykroyd</b>, <b>Ernie Hudson</b>, <b>Sigourney Weaver</b> and <b>Annie Potts </b>will be reprising their roles. The trailer instead focuses on the new characters, including<b> Paul Rudd</b> as a teacher with knowledge of the events of 1984, who will come together (with a little help from a handful of ghost-busting legends, we can assume) to save the world from another paranormal invasion.</p>
      <p>In other words, this is more of a “legacy sequel” than it is “<i>Ghostbusters 3,”</i> aiming to kick-start a whole new franchise rather than simply try to replicate the past after the under-performance of 2016’s reboot – the events of which most definitely did not happen in this timeline.</p>
      <p>Check out the official trailer for next year’s<i> Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> below, which fires the original Ecto-1 back up and teases both Terror Dogs and Slimer-like apparitions!</p>
      <p>In the film, written by Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan:</p>
      <blockquote>When a single mom and her two kids arrive in a small town, they begin to discover their connection to the original ghostbusters and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind.</blockquote>
      <p>The cast also includes <b>Oliver Cooper</b>, <b>Celeste O’Connor</b> and <b>Logan Kim</b>.</p>
      <p><i>Ghostbusters</i> will return to theaters on <b>July 10, 2020</b>.</p>
