      <p>MANILA, Dec 9 — The national badminton squad’s bounty of three gold, two silver and five bronze at the 30th SEA Games is a proud achievement for the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM), and proves that all is not lost as far as the future of Malaysian badminton is concerned.</p>
      <p>Its president Datuk Seri Mohamad Norza Zakaria said the successful campaign showed that there were unpolished diamonds in the national stable capable of shining in the future.</p>
      <p>“The three gold medals were contributed by young players, and they are the future of Malaysian badminton.</p>
      <p>“This was our best showing since the 1975 SEA Games, and our decision to provide them with exposure for the past two years has reaped rewards.</p>
      <p>“This is only the start for them, and I hope they continue to excel on the international stage” he said.</p>
      <p>The national badminton squad in the 1975 Bangkok edition also clinched three gold through the women’s singles, women’s doubles and mixed doubles.</p>
      <p>BAM coming into this edition had only targeted one gold. </p>
      <p>However, in a day full of determination and joy for the squad, Malaysia clinched the gold via the men’s and women’s singles and the men’s doubles. — Bernama</p>
