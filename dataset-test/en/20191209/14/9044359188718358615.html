      <p>Hold your tears just a minute because Gazini Ganados actually won the Miss Universe National Costume competition.</p>
      <p>The organization clarified the mix-up on Twitter saying host Steve Harvey had it right all along.</p>
      <p>"Miss Universe Philippines Gazini Ganados is the winner of the Miss Universe National Costume competition. Congratulations, Gazini!" the organization said in a tweet.</p>

      <p>Gazini's costume was inspired by the Philippine eagle. <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/shoppingandfashion/718467/cary-santiago-pegs-gazini-ganados-eagle-inspired-national-costume-at-p1m/story/">It was made by designer Cary Santiago who earlier told Unang Hirit</a> it took his team 45 days with 30 people working on it for 12 hours every day to complete.</p>
      <p>Gazini bowed out of the pageant early, failing to secure a spot in the Top 10. South African beauty queen Zozini Tunzi eventually won the pageant, bringing home the crown to South Africa for a third time. <b>â€” LA, GMA News</b></p>
