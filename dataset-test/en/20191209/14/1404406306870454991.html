      <p>Trump recently made an appearance at a small business event at the White House this past Friday and revealed that he ordered a federal review of water efficiency standards in relation to bathroom fixtures.</p>
      <p>Trump said, “People are flushing toilets ten times, 15 times as opposed to once. They end up using more water. You can’t wash your hands practically, there’s so little water comes out of the faucet, and the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you much longer to wash your hands, you end up using the same amount of water.”</p>
      <p>Trump also noted that he is looking into relaxing regulations for sinks and showers.</p>
