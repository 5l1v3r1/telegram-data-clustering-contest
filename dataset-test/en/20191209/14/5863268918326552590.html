      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Prime Minister Imran Khan has on Monday said that those people who abandon their vision do not succeed ever, Dunya News reported. </p>
      <p>The premier inaugurated Pakistan’s first National Science and Technology Park in Islamabad in the vicinity of National University of Science and Technology (NUST) and addressed the ceremony.</p>
      <p>“Everything starts with a vision. Those nations which lose confidence become dependent on others. There is no plan B when you follow your vision as you have burnt all your bridges. We saw a plan B a few days ago and then came a plan C and plan Z.</p>
      <p>“Some people get disheartened in tough time but you become stronger after rising from a failure. No one can beat you until you do not give up. Make struggle a part of your life and never be demoralized by the failures. The history only remembers those who work for the humanity. Passions always beats talent.</p>
      <p>“It is non-democratic practice that an entire family comes into politics. Pakistan has lagged behind in education. The country’s progress has been halted due to absence of merit in past.</p>
      <p>“A good captain knows where to utilize his players and that is why I have appointed Fawad Chaudhry as Minister for Science and Technology. I acknowledge his efforts.”</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister also appreciated Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa for always giving special emphasis on education. He urged the students to follow the life and teachings of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to become future leaders.</p>
      <p>Referring to the philanthropy of Bill Gates, Imran Khan said he is a great man who is spending his money for the welfare of humanity. He said Bill Gates is also providing funds to Pakistan for polio eradication.</p>
      <p>It is pertinent here to mention that National Science and Technology Park is being hailed as the country’s largest innovation and research ecosystem. The high-tech IT Park houses have more than forty companies, including start-ups, Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and tech giants.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan assured to provide every possible support to the university to take forward this project. He said this model will also be replicated in other institutions as well. According to the NUST statement, the park will serve as a launchpad for the country’s leading researchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs.</p>
