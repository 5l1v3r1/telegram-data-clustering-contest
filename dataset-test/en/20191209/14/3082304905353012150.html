        <b>Barcelona would never sell Lionel Messi, and the reason is quite simple – it is because even they have not yet figured out a way to stop the Argentine genius when he is in his element.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, how do we know that just like their opponents, Barcelona stars are also helpless when it comes to stopping Messi?</p>
      <p>A new video which surfaced online earlier this week proves it – as Messi can be seen zigzagging his way through the opposite team’s defence after the Barcelona squad decided to split into two and play against each other during a team training session.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the video shared right below:</p>

      <p>Needless to say, fans who watched the video were also left speechless.</p>
      <p>“It’s scarier because he’s been training with some of these guys for years and they still can’t figure him out,” @etin_bobo observed, as @AbdulJibrin12 remarked: “This Messi is a cheat code not yet created”.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, @JamesDe17863405 said, “Ready to take the 7th Balon’dor next year” as he expressed confidence that the six-time Ballon d’Or winner can lift one more trophy next year, after winning the 2019 edition of the award only a week ago.</p>

      <p>“When he scores everyone just keeps a straight face and continues training like it’s a normal business. He has immortalised himself,” @breezy017 concluded.</p>
