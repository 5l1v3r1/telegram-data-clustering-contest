      <p>‘Kuch pane ke liye, kuch khona padta hai’ this phrase stands true in case of the popular and successful rapper, Badshah. The rapper became a household name in the last few years, with his back to back hits; creating a fanbase for himself for his cool and happening numbers in Bollywood movies as well as his singles. But the rapper in his recent interview with an entertainment portal, Pinkvilla.com, revealed making several scarifies and also being dumped by his girlfriend, for choosing this profession of rapping to earn his livelihood.</p>
      <p>The rapper revealed loving his now ex-GF from the age of 3, confessing about loving her from an early age, did warm the cockles of our heart. But she turned her back on him due to his profession, as according to her that was not a suitable profession. “I was madly in love with this girl. I was probably three years old when I fell in love with her. She was with me, but she left me because it (music career) was not a ‘proper career choice’.” ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/badshah-comments-word-sir-on-vishal-dadlani-s-tweet-threatening-those-remixing-his-songs-netizens-take-his-case/5dba908687fb571eff7e338b">Badshah Comments 'Word Sir' On Vishal Dadlani's Tweet Threatening Those Remixing His Songs; Netizens Take His Case</a></p>
