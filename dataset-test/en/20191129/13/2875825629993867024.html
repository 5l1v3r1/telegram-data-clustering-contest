      <h1>Arsenal interim boss Freddie Ljungberg breaks silence after replacing Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Emery was sacked from his post as manager by the Arsenal board on Friday after a dismal run of results, with Ljungberg now tasked with handling first-team affairs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:21:01+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fredrik-ljungberg">Freddie Ljunberg</a> has vowed to "give everything" to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> after taking temporary charge following Unai Emery's sacking.</p>
      <p>The former Gunners midfielder has been handed the managerial reins after Emery was dismissed off the back of a run of seven games without a win.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg was confirmed as his replacement on an interim basis as the club pointed to "results and performances not being at the level required" for the reason behind <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/unai-emery">Emery's</a> exit.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg said on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "However long I oversee <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> for I will give everything I have to put smiles on faces again.</p>
      <p>"We have a busy few weeks ahead and the team needs your support. Letâ€™s get to work!"</p>

      <p>The start of this season has proved a challenge and a 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday night proved to be the last straw for Emery.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the Arsenal board and the club's owners Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Josh Kroenke said: "Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand.</p>
      <p>"We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success."</p>

      <p>The club statement added: "The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.</p>
      <p>"We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach. We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward.</p>
      <p>"The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete."</p>
      <p>The likes of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> boss Nuno Espirito Santo and former Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta, currently a coach at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , have been linked with the full-time job.</p>
      <p>But it remains to be seen how long Ljungberg, promoted from manager of Arsenal's Under-23s to Emery's assistant head coach during the summer, will remain in charge.</p>
      <p>His first game at the helm will come away to Norwich on Sunday before a home game with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and a London derby at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
