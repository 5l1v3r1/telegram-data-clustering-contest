      <p>Shares in Future Retail Ltd surged 13per cent on Friday, after India's antitrust body approved a deal that would give Amazon.com Inc a minority stake in one of the country's top retail groups.</p>
      <p>BENGALURU: Shares in Future Retail Ltd surged 13per cent on Friday, after India's antitrust body approved a deal that would give Amazon.com Inc a minority stake in one of the country's top retail groups.</p>
      <p>Future Retail in August announced the deal that would result in the U.S. online retail giant acquiring a 3.58per cent stake in the company, which runs over 1,500 stores in India and owns budget department store chain Big Bazaar.</p>

      <p>The companies had not disclosed the value of the deal, which would help Amazon push deeper into India's booming retail market.</p>
      <p>In a brief statement on Thursday, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it had approved Amazon's purchase of a 49per cent stake in Future Coupons Ltd, an entity that owns about 7.3per cent of Future Retail, adding that it would soon provide a detailed order.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported early this month that the CCI had sought more information from Amazon about the planned transaction.</p>
      <p>Last year, Amazon and Indian private equity firm Samara Capital announced a joint investment in an entity that would give Amazon a stake in local supermarket chain More.</p>
      <p>The Seattle-headquartered firm also owns a stake in Indian department store chain Shopper's Stop.</p>
      <p>Shares in Future Retail were higher by 13.8per cent by 10 a.m. in Mumbai. Shares in other Future Group companies - Future Enterprises Ltd, Future Consumer Ltd and Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd - were higher by 2per cent to 16per cent.</p>
      <p>The Economic Times reported in August that the deal pegged Future Retail's value at close to US$6 billion, more than double its then market capitalization of US$2.9 billion.</p>
