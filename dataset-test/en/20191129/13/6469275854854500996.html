        <b>Let’s be honest, no-one knows who or what to believe as this General Election looms.</b>
      </p>
      <p>What with fake news, real news and everyone’s opinion, however outlandish, being treated with more or less the same level of wide-eyed belief or scepticism, you’d be forgiven for thinking this year’s best-selling Christmas gift would be a carrot called Kevin. (Oh, wait..)</p>
      <p>The continued dominance of social media to influence you, when you don’t even realise you are being influenced, plus the Trump-tastic trend to call everything we don’t like ‘fake news’ (I didn’t murder him yer honour, it’s fake news I tell you..) is so confusing.</p>
      <p>Now political parties are printing newspapers which look very similar to actual newspapers in a disingenuous move reminiscent of dystopian science fiction a la George Orwell’s 1984.</p>
      <p>The sheer arrogance of this – which assumes voters are eminently gullible – is staggering.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it’s safe to say we are a society scarred by the Brexit vote – which was so long ago and we’ve never heard the end of – and the promises made by parties across the colour spectrum.</p>
      <p>So as the ballot creeps closer and the promises get more wildly people-pleasing and accusations ever-more calculated, it’s wise to step back and think about what values we actually need from a new government, away from the frantic politicking headlines favoured by your Facebook feed.</p>
      <p>It’s easy to forget the algorithms are playing games with your mind and forming your opinions for you.</p>
      <p>Think about those shoes you once Googled – and ho the ad reappears in your feed until you buy them – the same thing is happening with politics.</p>
      <p>To that end, nobody could be blamed if they were tempted to pretend it's not happening in favour of staying in and watching repeats of a It’s A Wonderful Life until Christmas arrives.</p>
      <p>Things were simpler back then..</p>
      <p>But voting is still important, however undecided we feel and however cold the weather.</p>
      <p>We are not a democratic society without it.</p>
      <p>Personally, I’ll be voting for Kevin the carrot – he’s promised nothing.</p>
