      <p>He also urged his main challenger, Senator Jeremiah Useni of the Peoples Democratic Party to concede defeat and join hands with his administration to move the state forward.</p>
      <p>But Lalong in a statement signed by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Makut Machamon Friday, Lalong called on Plateau citizens to continue supporting his administration.</p>
      <p>The statement read: “This is not a victory for me but for the entire people of Plateau State, who have demonstrated faith in our Rescue Mission. Like I have repeatedly said, I’m governor for everyone irrespective of party, tribe, religious or any other affiliation. I’m ready to carry everyone along.”</p>
      <p>The governor described his victory at the Appeal Court as yet another collective victory for the entire people of Plateau State.</p>
      <p>Lalong added that the verdict of the court didn’t surprise him as he has never doubted the validity of the mandate reposed in him and the APC.</p>
