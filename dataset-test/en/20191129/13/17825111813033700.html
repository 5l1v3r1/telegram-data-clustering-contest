      <p>Virginia -Â  Rohina Husseini had no idea someone could steal a house, but the first small clue that the home she owned for nearly a decade was no longer hers was a piece of junk mail that most of us ignore. <br/>The Springfield, Virginia, mother said she initially tossed the mortgage refinancing offers that began arriving over the summer in the trash, but one detail bugged her: The letters were addressed to another woman. Curious, Husseini said she finally opened one. <br/>"You bought a new house, congratulations," read the letter addressed to Masooda Persia Hashimi.</p>
