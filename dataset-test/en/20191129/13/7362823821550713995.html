      <p>Adrianna Edwards of Galveston, Texas, used to walk 14 miles a day to get to her job at the diner chain. The entire journey took her more than four hours.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do,” Edwards said to <a href="https://www.wtoc.com/2019/11/28/couple-surprises-dennys-waitress-who-walked-miles-work-with-new-car/">KTRK</a> of her long trek.</p>

      <p>Edwards was in the process of saving to buy a car when the kind couple took matters into their own hands.</p>

      <p>The pair, who reportedly requested to remain anonymous, visited the restaurant Tuesday morning for breakfast. It was then they learned of Edwards' long trips to and from work each day.</p>
      <p>After eating their meal, the two left only to return hours later with the surprise of a lifetime — a 2011 Nissan Sentra they had just purchased, KTRK reports.</p>

      <p>The moment brought tears to Edwards’ eyes.</p>
      <p>"I still feel like I'm dreaming. Every two hours, I come look out my window and see if there's still a car there,” she said to the outlet.</p>
      <p>Now she is able to get to and from work in 30 minutes, cutting hours off of her commute.</p>

      <p>The couple was happy to help Edwards out, but requested that she pay it forward to others in need, which the woman has said she intends on doing.</p>
