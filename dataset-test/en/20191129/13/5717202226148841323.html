      <h1>Freddie Ljungberg sends message to Arsenal fans after Unai Emery sacking</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:23:15+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg has posted on Twitter after being placed in interim charge of Arsenal following the sacking of Unai Emery, who saw his side go seven games without a win on Thursday night at the hands of Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Emery was sacked on Friday morning after watching his side surrender a 1-0 lead to Frankfurt on Thursday night, despite having home advantage. Indeed, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s first half-strike was cancelled out by a Daichi Kamada brace.</p>
      <p>It has seen Arsenal go seven games without a win, last winning a Premier League match on October 6 – in the form of a 1-0 win over Bournemouth. Ljungberg, who has been in charge of the Under-23’s, has taken temporary charge.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest Max Allegri, Nuno Espirito Santo, Mauricio Pochettino, Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti are the favourites to replace Emery – while Ljungberg also has a chance of getting the job. He posted a message to Arsenal fans on Twitter.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Does Ljungberg have a chance of winning the job?</h3>
      <p>There is no doubt that he could. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer proved that a former player returning to his old side on a temporary basis can win the fans over, and it has since seen the Norwegian take over permanently at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>However, Ljungberg will have to hit the ground running. Adored by Arsenal fans and reportedly liked by the playing staff, Ljungberg will need to reunite a beleguered squad lacking in morale. They take on Norwich City this weekend.</p>
