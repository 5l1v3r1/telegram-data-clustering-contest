      <p>Jason Garrett will remain coach of the Cowboys for at least another week despite ahome loss to the Bills on Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Team owner and general manager Jerry Jones told reporters following the 26-15 defeat that he will not make a coaching change even though his team is now 6-6 and in danger of being overtaken by the Eagles in the NFC East.</p>

      <p>Jones believes Garrett is still the right coach to get the Cowboys to the playoffs.</p>
      <p>"This is not the time for me [to make a coaching change]," Jones told reporters postgame. "I'm looking ahead at another ballgame. I'm looking ahead at winning four or five straight and helping write a story they will talk about, how it looks like you're down and out.</p>
      <p>"And I mean that. That's the way that I'm operating. Every decision that I make over the next month will be with an eye in mind to get us in the Super Bowl now."</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't make a change and give us a chance to do what I want to dream about doing. I wouldn't do that for love nor money," Jones said. "It would give us zero chance if we didn't have [Garrett]."</p>

      <p>"Do you believe in redemption?" Jones asked a reporter, who replied in the affimative (video per <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/article237873154.html">the Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>). "I am a redemption man, too, so I think that you can change, to some degree, who you are."</p>
