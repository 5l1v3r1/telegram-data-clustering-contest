      <p>An unspecified threat led to security measures being put in place at three Nanaimo schools Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Dover Bay Secondary was placed in lockdown while nearby Nanaimo and District Secondary and McGirr Elementary were placed in a hold-and-secure. The security measures were lifted as of as of 11:20 a.m.</p>
      <p>A lockdown involves restricting students to a specific part of the school, like a classroom. In a hold-and-secure, the exterior doors are locked while activities inside proceed as normal.</p>
      <p>As a precaution and to answer any questions from parents, two officers were assigned to each school for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>Call Nanaimo RCMP with any information about the situation at 250-754-2345.</p>
