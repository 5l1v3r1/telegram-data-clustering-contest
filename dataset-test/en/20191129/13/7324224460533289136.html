      <p>Nicola Sturgeon is preparing to “get into bed” with Jeremy Corbyn to win a Scottish independence referendum, the Chancellor has claimed.</p>
      <p>Sajid Javid used a visit to Scotland to criticise both the SNP leader and her “far-left allies in the Labour Party”, which he claimed is “riddled” with anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Campaigning in Stirling – one of the SNP’s top targets in next month’s General Election – he spoke about the “chaotic” impact of a Government led by Mr Corbyn and supported by Ms Sturgeon.</p>

      <p>While Mr Corbyn has ruled out allowing Scotland to have a second vote on independence in the “early years” of a Labour administration, the Chancellor claimed such a vote would take place next year.</p>
      <p>He said the UK would also have to deal with a “divisive” second referendum on Brexit.</p>
      <p>“If Corbyn can’t get a majority he will absolutely have an alliance with Nicola Sturgeon, they have already had discussions, they have already agreed they would have another divisive referendum on Brexit but also a divisive referendum on independence,” Mr Javid said.</p>
      <p>“That would be chaotic, two referendums in the UK in 2020, and Nicola Sturgeon will have to accept that yes she might get her beloved referendum with a Corbyn/Sturgeon alliance but she will getting into bed with a individual that has serious issue with Britain’s Jewish community, who has been caught time and time again denigrating the Jewish community and has a problem of anti-Semitism riddled throughout his party.</p>
      <p>“She would be supporting such an individual and she would have to explain how she can prop up someone like that who, just a couple of days ago, the Chief Rabbi was moved to say was not fit for office.”</p>
      <aside>The most divisive thing they have brought to this election is their demand for a second independence referendum<cite>Sajid Javid on the SNP</cite></aside>
      <p>He underlined the Conservatives’ opposition to a second independence ballot and said Scots had a choice between the “division” being offered by the SNP or the Conservatives, who he insisted were “delivering for Scotland”.</p>
      <p>“This is the stark choice facing the Scottish people,” the Chancellor said.</p>
      <p>“They can either chose to have Scottish Conservatives that are delivering for Scottish people, removing uncertainty whether it is the indy referendum, getting Brexit sorted … and also supporting taxpayers with our cuts in taxes.</p>
      <p>“That’s delivery from the Scottish Conservatives. Or it is division from the SNP.</p>
      <p>“The most divisive thing they have brought to this election is their demand for a second independence referendum.”</p>
      <p>He added: “When the last referendum took place in 2014 everyone agreed, including Nicola Sturgeon, that it was a once in generation event.</p>
      <p>“It was right to have the referendum then, the Scottish people spoke, gave a very clear verdict that they wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>“Now, I know five or six years have passed since then, but it is not a new generation.</p>
      <p>“And it is wrong to have this referendum again, we are absolutely against it, we think it is divisive and we will not support it.”</p>
      <p>He criticised the SNP’s record, attacking the Scottish Government’s performance in key areas such as education, the NHS and policing.</p>

      <p>Mr Javid also claimed the SNP were to blame for the delays in the Scottish budget – which has been held up because of the UK General Election.</p>
      <p>Scotland Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has complained he is unable to put together his tax and spending plans for 2020-21 until after the new year.</p>
      <p>But the Chancellor said the SNP’s role in delaying Brexit meant they were responsible for this situation.</p>
      <p>He said: “Normally we would have had a UK Budget by now, that would have meant it would have been more straightforward to have a Scottish budget.</p>
      <p>“But the responsibility for not having that budget, either in the UK or Scotland, lies firmly and squarely with the SNP and Labour.</p>
      <p>“The SNP are responsible, along with Labour and the Lib Dems, for the paralysis that has taken hold of our Parliament.</p>
      <p>“It is that paralysis that has meant the country has been unable to move forward and get Brexit sorted, and we have been unable as Parliament to make other major decisions, including a national Budget.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s a bit rich of Nicola Sturgeon to complain and say ‘our budget process in Scotland is being held up because of the UK’ because she is partly responsible for it.</p>
      <p>“It is not the Conservative Government in Westminster that is responsible for it, it is Nicola Sturgeon and her far-left allies in the Labour Party.”</p>
