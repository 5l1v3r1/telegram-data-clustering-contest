      <p>An old video of Anne Doyle and Gay Byrne on The Late Late Show has resurfaced online – and people are loving it.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the Toy Show tonight, our favourite Instagram account @irishcelebsdoingthings shared a clip of Anne when she was on the show back in 1986.</p>
      <p>Gay was hosting the show at the time, and a number of famous faces were invited on to pick their favourite toy, including Anne – who picked a Garfield teddy.</p>
      <p>They captioned the post: “Anne Doyle talking about her love of Garfield and cats on the Toy Show in 1986. This is the kind of energy the modern-day Toy Show is missing!!!!”</p>

      <p>“(Side-note: I am living for how she raises her eyebrows as she says the word ‘pussycats’. Also living for how she refers to the stray cats who live in her back garden as ‘gentlemen’.)”</p>
      <p>The Late Late Toy Show first aired back in 1975, and has since become a bizarre but beloved Christmas tradition in Ireland.</p>
      <p>The show originally began as a half-hour slot at the end of The Late Late Show, designed to give parents an idea of what toys they should get for their children at Christmas time.</p>

      <p>Viewers loved the segment so much that it was eventually turned into an annual special, and was presented by the late Gay Byrne until 1999, when Pat Kenny took over as Late Late Show host.</p>
      <p>Ten years later, Ryan Tubridy stepped into the hosting role in 2009, and has been presenting the show ever since.</p>
      <p>Tonight, <a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/ryan-tubridy-reveals-this-years-magical-late-late-toy-show-theme-192088">the Late Late Toy Show theme is Frozen</a>, and the programme will pay tribute to Gay Byrne – who sadly passed away earlier this month following a long battle with cancer.</p>
