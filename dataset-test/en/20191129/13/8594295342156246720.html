      <blockquote>Is there a good (single?) place to search and discover what year car models updated their drivetrain or added some feature I might want?<br/><br/>I’m looking at a couple of used car options, probably recent cars coming off leases, and am wondering if model year 2016 or 2017 (for example) are significantly different for a Subaru Outback or a Mazda CX-5. All cars change a bit, every year but some stuff I care about (the Skyactiv suspension) and others (new paint colors or the move from 8 speakers to 10) not as much.<br/><br/>I know this information is not impossible to find, but the flood of info and changes for the most recent year can bury the details on models just a few years old. Or maybe I am just using weak GoogleFu.</blockquote>

      <p>I often use three sources (<a href="https://www.auto-brochures.com/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/kia/optima/2018/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.automobile-catalog.com/">here</a>) for make/model research here at TTAC. After randomly poking around for changes on Kia’s Optima, all three did good.</p>
      <p>Shockingly, regarding your potential Subaru Outback, only <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/subaru/outback/">one resource</a> has pertinent information. And now I am terrified to look up the Mazda CX-5!</p>
      <p>From what I’ve seen with print materials via <a href="https://detroitpubliclibrary.org/research/national-automotive-history-collection">Automotive Literary Mecca</a>, the most granular, year-by-year information lives within dealer training manuals. Not easy to acquire if you live outside of Metro Detroit, I know. Who knows, sometimes dealerships have this stuff lying around for years: never hurts to ask!</p>
      <p>So check out my three sources, dig into model-specific forums and — <i>wait for it — </i>ask the Best and Brightest for their opinion!</p>
