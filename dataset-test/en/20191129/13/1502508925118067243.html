      <p>India accounted for 22 per cent of all visa-related searches to the US from abroad in 2018, according to a survey.</p>
      <p>This is not surprising given that nearly 62.7 per cent of initial H1B approvals in the fiscal year 2017, were for Indian nationals, according to a report by job site Indeed.</p>
      <p>The report is based on data on job searches on Indeed platform in 2018.</p>
      <p>The number of visa-related searches from outside the US peaked in November 2018.</p>
      <p>In August 2019, the share of the US visa-related searches from abroad were 75.6 per cent, more than double its August 2017 level of 36.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Overall, the top 10 countries accounted for nearly 56.5 per cent of all foreign visa-related searches in 2018, the report added.</p>
      <p>"In 2018, job searches from India to the US that contained visa-related terms like 'H1B visa' or 'work visa' surged. When broken out by region we see that, for 2018, the Maharashtra region accounted for 11.3 per cent of all visa- related job searches from India to the US," Indeed Hiring Lab chief economist Jed Kolko said.</p>
      <p>This was followed by the Delhi region at 9.6 per cent and Gujarat at 8.5 per cent, he said.</p>
      <p>"When looking at changes between the first half of 2018 against the latter, the share of visa-related searches from the Tamil Nadu region increased the most (up 3.1 percent), followed by Gujarat and Punjab," Kolko added.</p>
      <p>H1B visa denials are at a record level, while quotas for H2B visas have been raised, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Both visa types allow the US employers to temporarily employ foreign workers H1B for speciality occupations and H2B for seasonal work, it added.</p>
