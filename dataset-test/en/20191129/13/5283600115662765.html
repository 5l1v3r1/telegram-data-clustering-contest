      <h1>Maharashtra CM Thackeray stays Metro carshed work</h1>

      <p>Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday announced a stay to construction of metro carshed in the city’s green lung Aarey Colony, where strong protests had erupted last month against cutting of trees for the work.</p>
      <p>The BJP slammed the decision, with former CM Devendra Fadnavis saying that it will discourage investors and stall infrastructure projects in the city. Thackeray, who is heading a Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress coalition, was sworn in on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Then BJP-led government in Maharashtra had come under fire from green activists in October when over 2,000 trees were felled for a carshed, to be constructed in Aarey Colony which is adjacent to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena, then junior partner in the Devendra Fadnavis government, had opposed the felling of trees. “I have stayed Aarey carshed work. I will review the entire thing...I will not allow a culture where trees are cut at night,” Thackeray told reporters.</p>
      <p>“Not a single tree leaf will be cut till further orders,” he added, while clarifying that metro work itself has not been stayed. A Supreme Court bench had last month sought a status report with pictures on plantation, transplantation and felling of trees in Aarey colony area.</p>
      <p>The Bombay High Court had on October 4 refused to declare Aarey Colony a forest and declined to quash the Mumbai municipal corporation’s decision to allow felling of over 2,600 trees in the green zone to set up a metro carshed. Hours after the court gave a go-ahead, tree were cut at night, fuelling outrage.</p>
      <p>Reacting to Thackeray’s announcement, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis said it was “unfortunate that State Government stayed Aarey Metro carshed work in spite of Hon Supreme Court &amp; Hon High Court orders”.</p>
      <p>“This shows State Government is not serious about Mumbai Infrastructure projects! And ultimate sufferer is common Mumbaikar only !” Fadnavis tweeted with hashtag “savemetrosaveMumbai”.</p>
