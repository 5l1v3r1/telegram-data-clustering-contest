      <h2>New poll shows Israelis divided on whether Netanyahu can serve under indictment. Blue and White poised to expand margin over the Likud.</h2>

      <p>Israelis are sharply divided over whether Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu should be able to continue to serve after being indicted on corruption charges, a new polls shows.</p>
      <p>Nearly half of respondents (48%) say Netanyahu cannot continue to serve as prime minister while under indictment, compared to 46% who said he can continue, according to a new poll conducted by the Smith polling agency and published by <i>Ma’ariv</i> Friday.</p>
      <p>Among Likud voters, 82% say Netanyahu can continue as premier, compared to just 6% of Blue and White voters.</p>
      <p>The poll also found that if new elections were held today, the center-left Blue and White party would best the Likud by two seats, 35 to 33, if Netanyahu retains control of the Likud.</p>
      <p>In that scenario, the left-wing – Arab bloc would gain one seat, rising from 57 seats won in September to 58 seats, while the right-wing – religious bloc would fall from 55 seats to 54.</p>
      <p>Avidgor Liberman’s Yisrael Beytenu party, which has called for a national unity government, would retain its eight seats.</p>
      <p>On the Left, the Democratic Union and Labor would win five seats each, while the Joint Arab List would win 13.</p>
      <p>Among the haredi parties, Shas would receive eight seats, down from its present nine, while United Torah Judaism would retain its seven setas.</p>
      <p>The New Right party, which recently announced that it would run independently, would receive six seats, while the Jewish Home – National Union would fail to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold, leaving it out of the 23rd Knesset.</p>
      <p>If Netanyahu loses next month’s planned leadership race to MK Gideon Sa’ar, however, the Likud would win just 31 seats, while Blue and White would remain steady at 35.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the right-wing bloc as a whole would benefit from Sa’ar leading the Likud, with the Jewish Home – National Union clearing the threshold with four seats. The New Right would win six seats in this scenario, with Shas at eight, and UTJ at seven.</p>
      <p>The right-wing bloc as a whole would win 56 seats if Gideon Sa’ar leads the Likud, compared to 57 seats for the left-wing – Arab bloc and just seven seats for Yisrael Beytenu.</p>
      <p>The Democratic Union would win just four seats in this scenario, compared to five for Labor, and 13 for the Joint Arab List.</p>
