      <p>The Saints erased the sting of its Week 10 defeat to the Falcons with a hard-earned 26-18 victory over Atlanta on Thanksgiving night to claim the NFC South title.</p>
      <p>New Orleans (10-2) took its largest lead of the game after Wil Lutz's fourth field goalmade the score26-9. The Falcons (3-9) weren't done, though. Atlanta found its way into the end zone with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Matt Ryan to Russell Gage.The score gave the Falcons life after a flurry of empty possessions and turnovers.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Following an unsuccessful2-point conversion, Atlanta recovered an onside kick and marched into New Orleans territory, setting up a 43-yard Younghoe Koo field goal to make it a one-possession game with just under two minutes remaining.</p>
