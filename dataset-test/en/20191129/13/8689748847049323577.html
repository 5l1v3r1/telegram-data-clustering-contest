      <p>Multiple Award-winning Dancehall artist Shatta Wale has taken a swipe at the government’s  for failing to educate the public on their “Year of Return” initiative.</p>

      <p>“We failed to educate the country about this year of return. I don’t see anything going on about this year of return. I feel the government has failed to educate the people” he lamented.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale also added that even he is clueless about the initiative and all he knows is that people are coming to Ghana and what he notices is that, when the people come, they only visit the president and the Cape Coast castle.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a recent interview on UTV, Shatta Wale says the idea hasn’t been explained enough for Ghanaians to understand it and there is a lot more work to be done.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale was recently at the launch of Efia Odo’s new wineshop dubbed ” South African Wines”. The likes of Sandra Ankobia, King Promise amongst others were present to show their full support.</p>
