      <h1>Club said to have made €10m offer to Manchester United – Further meeting hasn’t happened yet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:33:54+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Chris Smalling’s future at AS Roma, or otherwise, has been covered relentlessly by the Italian sport media in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The Manchester United owned defender has been in good form since his move to Serie A, and Roma are thought to be making attempts to get the player on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.giallorossi.net/on-air-radio-romane-reazioni-e-commenti-a-basaksehir-roma-29-novembre-2019/">Giallorossi.net</a> have started a daily feature in which they compile lots of claims made on Italian radio about their club and potential transfers. When it comes to Smalling, there’s of course information to share.</p>
      <p>According to radio journalist Ilario Di Giovambattista, recent claims of Roma holding meetings with Smalling’s representatives are wide of the mark. It’s claimed an offer has been made to Manchester United, of just €10m, but there’s been no follow up contact on that.</p>
      <p>This contradicts claims from earlier this week, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/club-want-pay-manchester-united-just-e12m-player-doesnt-sound-like-great-deal/">when Il Messaggero reported Roma’s first offer was €12m</a>, which also seemed on the low side.</p>
      <p>Manchester United were said to be asking for €20m, and it was hoped a compromise could be found.</p>
      <p>Another radio journalist, Alessandro Angeloni, is quoted as saying: <i>“If Smalling wants to stay in Rome, say it openly, involve people in this state of mind.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I don’t put in doubt that Smalling wants to stay, but if he said something it would be better because otherwise you still have the doubt.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Should the footballer go public then Roma will believe it can help them seal a deal. However, if he’s unsure about what he really wants to do, or unsure the Italian side can reach an agreement with Manchester United, then speaking out doesn’t appear the wisest idea.</p>
