      <p>Television star Lorraine Kelly has been presented with a specially commissioned portrait on her morning show to celebrate her 60th birthday.</p>
      <p>The work by University of Dundee graduate Sylvia Tarvet was gifted to the host live on air on Friday by Dr Hilary Jones ahead of her birthday on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was commissioned by members of the team working on the Lorraine show as a surprise present for the former rector of the university.</p>

      <p>Kelly said: “This is such an honour. That is absolutely beautiful. She’s made me look about 15 years younger. It’s amazing.”</p>
      <p>Ms Tarvet graduated with a degree in fine art from the university’s Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in 2017.</p>
      <p>She wished her subject a happy birthday in a recorded message that accompanied the 36cm by 64cm oil painting.</p>
      <p>The artist said: “I was very honoured to be selected to paint Lorraine’s portrait and can only hope the final work does her justice.</p>
      <p>“I know that she is a great supporter of Duncan of Jordanstone and its graduates and, as I am trying to establish myself as an artist after graduating, this was a major commission for me.</p>
      <p>“Normally I would meet the person I’m painting to do sketches and take my own reference photos.</p>
      <p>“Of course it wasn’t possible to do that in this case because the painting was a surprise so it was a little more difficult that other portraits. I’d love to get the chance to paint her from life.”</p>
      <p>She added: “She has a lovely, open face that is quick to smile but I wanted to show a more contemplative side of her personality, too.</p>
      <p>“The unveiling was very nerve-wracking because I really hope she likes and that I have captured not only a physical resemblance but a little of the real Lorraine – kind, contemplative and comfortable in herself.”</p>
