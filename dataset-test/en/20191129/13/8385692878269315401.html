      <p>Amazon has the LG Stylo 5 unlocked Android smartphone on sale for just $159 today. Allowing you to save 47-percent on this device. As it is normally $299.</p>
      <p>The LG Stylo 5 is not a flagship smartphone, so don't expect to get a better smartphone than the Pixel 4 or the Galaxy S10. It's a smartphone that will do the basics for you, at a much cheaper price – and it comes with a stylus.</p>
      <p>LG has outfitted the Stylo 5 with a 6.2-inch Full HD+ display, a 1.8GHz octa-core processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. That is obviously not a lot of storage in 2019, but there is at least a micro SD card slot available for expanding storage on the Stylo 5. And with 1TB micro SD cards being on sale right now, you might as well grab one.</p>

      <p>It runs on Android 9 Pie right now, but it is expected to get updated to Android 10 in the near future. Though LG has not specified when exactly that is going to happen.</p>
      <p>This is a pretty nice, big screen smartphone from LG that does just about everything you need it to do. It does have a 13-megapixel camera on the back of the phone, for taking images. Now it's not the best, but it gets the job done. Of course, it would be nice to have multiple cameras, but on a sub-$300 (normally) smartphone, that is very unlikely.</p>
      <p>This is an unlocked smartphone and it will work on all four US carriers. That includes AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. So you can just pop in your SIM card and you'll be ready to go.</p>
