      <p>BAGHDAD, Nov 29 — Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said today he would offer his resignation to parliament to allow lawmakers to choose a new government, in a move that follows weeks of violent anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>Abdul Mahdi’s decision came in response to a call for a change of leadership today by Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, his office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“In response to this call, and in order to facilitate it as quickly as possible, I will present to parliament a demand (to accept) my resignation from the leadership of the current government,” said the statement, signed by Abdul Mahdi.</p>
      <p>The statement did not specify when he would tender his resignation. Parliament is due to convene on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The announcement came after weeks of anti-government unrest in which security forces have killed around 400 mostly peaceful demonstrators and the country has careered towards a serious escalation of violence. — Reuters</p>
