      <p>A three-year-old boy with suspected autism suffered fatal head injuries in a complete breach of trust by his killer, a lawyer told a court.</p>
      <p>Kayden McGuinness sustained 15 bruises on the scalp and died from swelling and bleeding of the brain.</p>
      <p>He was found dead in bed at his family flat in Londonderry in September 2017.</p>
      <p>Liam Whoriskey, 25, from Londonderry, was convicted of manslaughter and cruelty to a child by a jury at the city’s crown court in October.</p>
      <p>He was a former partner of the child’s mother.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Peter Irvine QC said: “There was a complete breach of trust in this case.”</p>
      <p>The child died from blunt force trauma, and probation officers said Whoriskey, from Glenabbey Gardens, posed a significant risk to other members of the public.</p>
      <p>His former partner said he was aggressive and violent.</p>
      <p>She said: “He went from 0-60, roaring and shouting.”</p>
      <p>A pre-sentence hearing was held at Londonderry Crown Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>Whoriskey will be sentenced on December 16.</p>
