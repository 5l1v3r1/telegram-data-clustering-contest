      <p>It can be so frustrating when you research your next smartphone, find the best possible deal, get the phone in your hands and then see the same item available at a lower price at a different retailer, especially during the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> sales. There usually isn’t much you can do about it but Google is stepping up to the plate by introducing an improved price matching policy for items bought from the Google Store.</p>
      <p>It’s still a fairly limited program in that there are only four retailers eligible for price matching: Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. And as you might expect, there are a number of criteria that must be adhered to, namely:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only online pricing for these retailers: Amazon (sold by Amazon.com), Best Buy, Target, Walmart.</li>
        <li>Requests must be made within the buyer’s remorse period.</li>
        <li>Advertised prices must be for the same model (same color and memory, if applicable).</li>
        <li>Advertised price must still be in effect when adjustment is requested, and no rain checks if Google Store is out of stock.</li>
        <li>Only 2 per customer per model.</li>
        <li>For phones, only applicable to Unlocked.</li>
        <li>Customer must provide a live link to the promo or webpage that verifies the price. PDFs, screenshots, pictures, or individual price quotes not accepted.</li>
        <li>Google reserves the right to decline a price match if we suspect fraud or unauthorized reseller activity.</li>
        <li>Available by chat or phone only.</li>
        <li>Excludes: Contract mobile phones or financing deals; special daily or hourly deals; pre-order or trade-in offers; wholesale or educational pricing; mail-in, coupon, or gift card offers; pricing errors; product bundles or free items; bundled services or support; clearance, open box, refurbished, or pre-owned items; products shipped or sold by third-party sellers on competitor’s website.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s unfortunate that you aren’t allowed to submit price matching requests via email or an online form but Google isn’t accepting screenshots, PDFs, or images taken of the deals from other online stores. If your price matching request is successful, Google will refund the difference to the original payment method.</p>
