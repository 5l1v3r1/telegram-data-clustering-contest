      <h1>Shooting: Angad Bajwa pips Mairaj to win gold in skeet nationals, Saniya Sheikh bags third title</h1>

      <p>Angad Vir Singh Bajwa unofficially hit a world record score in the men’s skeet final to lead Punjab’s domination of the category at the 63rd National Shooting Championships for Shotgun events on Friday.</p>
      <p>Angad held off his senior and fellow Tokyo 2020 quota winner Mairaj Ahmad Khan of Uttar Pradesh, shooting a clean 60 to equal a record he also officially jointly holds with skeet legend Vincent Hancock and two others.</p>
      <p>Mairaj missed a couple of targets to yet again go down to the youngster after the now famous quota-winning 1-2 run by the duo earlier this month at the Asian championships in Qatar. Mairaj also had a splendid day, shooting a world record himself, a perfect 125 in qualifying to breeze into the final. Both Angad and Mairaj will be credited with national records, however.</p>
      <p>Saniya Sheikh stopped the Punjab juggernaut, bagging her third national title winning the women’s skeet event in a shoot-off with state-mate Areeba Khan 10-8. Abhay Singh Sekhon and Parnaaz Dhaliwal of Punjab also won the junior men’s and women’s skeet golds respectively.</p>
