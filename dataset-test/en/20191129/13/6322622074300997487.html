      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 29): The whopping RM315.38 million impairment on its investment in an Australia-listed associate, AVEO, widened Mulpha International Bhd's net loss substantially to RM299.32 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19) from RM6.65 million in the previous corresponding quarter.</p>
      <p>The hefty impairment offset the improved performance in the hospitality and property divisions, said the company in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The company’s loss per share swelled to 93.69 sen for 3QFY19 from 2.08 sen for 3QFY18. Quarterly revenue, however, grew 24.9% to RM210.53 million from RM168.55 million last year due to better performance in the hospitality and property divisions.</p>
      <p>The property division recorded a higher pre-tax profit of RM25.34 million from RM18.72 million. The division generated revenue of RM69.51 million from RM58.01 million a year ago. Mulpha attributed better performance to higher settlements in the Sanctuary Cove developments in Australia.</p>
      <p>The hospitality division registered higher pre-tax profit of RM11.52 million compared with RM4.7 million a year ago. Revenue was higher at RM118.83 million from RM91.37 million previously. It said the division’s better performance was mainly due to the reopened Hayman Island Resort.</p>
      <p>Its investment and other activities division recorded a pre-tax loss of RM327.1 million for 3QFY19 from RM4.98 million last year, due to the impairment loss in AVEO.</p>
      <p>For its nine-month period, the company recorded a net loss of RM396.43 million against a net profit of RM139.8 million last year despite revenue rising 4% to RM530.77 million from RM510.36 million.</p>
      <p>Mulpha International's counter closed 2.05% or four sen higher at RM1.99, with 27,300 shares traded, giving it a market capitalisation of RM635.74 million.</p>
