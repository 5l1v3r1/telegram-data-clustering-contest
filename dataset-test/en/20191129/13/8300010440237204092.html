      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Some rain and snow will continue to fall in Southern California on Friday and intermittently over the next several days.<br/><br/>A storm warning remains in effect for the mountains at least until 4 p.m. Friday. The mountains have already seen about 24-28 inches of snow this week, a heavy amount for this early in the season. Big Bear could see another 5 inches on Friday.<br/><br/>Snow will continue to fall in the mountains at elevations as low as 3,500 feet, resulting in low visibility and an icy 5 Freeway through the Grapevine. Plan ahead for alternate roadways where chains may be needed and expect to drive slowly.<br/><br/>Los Angeles and Orange counties can expect to see less than half an inch of rain on Friday, with temperatures remaining in the mid-50s.<br/><br/>There is a chance of rain again on Saturday and Sunday, and potentially another round on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br/><br/>The valleys and Inland Empire could see up to an inch of rain on Friday, with temperatures in the low 50s.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://abc7.com/apps/">Get the latest updates on the rain with the Free ABC7 Los Angeles app</a></b><br/><br/><b>Download the ABC7 app for weather alerts: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc7-los-angeles/id405387506?mt=8">Click here for iOS devices</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abclocal.kabc.news">click here for Android devices</a>.</b> If you have the app, turn on push notifications and personalize the app. Click on <b>My News</b> from the bottom menu, then star the topics you'd like to follow and tap Done.<br/><br/><br/><b>Live radar: <a href="https://abc7.com/weather/doppler/">abc7.la/LiveMEGADOPPLER</a><br/>Watches/Warnings: <a href="https://abc7.com/weather/alerts/">abc7.la/WxWarnings</a><br/><br/>Download the free Accuweather app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id300048137?mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accuweather.android&amp;referrer=utm_source=ABC_LosAngeles">Android</a> devices.<br/>Share your weather pictures and video with #ABC7Eyewitness</b><br/><br/><br/><b>7-Day Forecasts</b></p>
