      <p>THE Mayo Garda Division lacks the required vehicle equipment compared with neighbouring counties, says Fianna Fáil TD Lisa Chambers.</p>
      <p>Analysis by the party shows the Mayo Gardaí Division has 53 vehicles. This includes 38 cars, 12 vans, one motorcycle, one 4x4 and one other vehicle.</p>
      <p>Said Deputy Chambers: “We are the third largest county in Ireland. The Mayo Garda Division covers this entire area, yet they have some of the lowest resources in terms of vehicles compared with neighbouring divisions.</p>
      <p>“For example, Galway Garda Division has a total of 102 vehicles and Donegal 66. We are not near these divisions in terms of vehicle capacity despite similar sizes in regions and the rural dynamic of our county.</p>
      <p>“Back in 2011 we had 59 vehicles and it has remained a similar figure over the past eight years, never rising above 60.”</p>
      <p>She continued: “There are towns and villages across Mayo which feel abandoned by Fine Gael following the closure of their garda stations. Many say fear levels have increased in their communities and have repeatedly called for additional resources. These figures will do nothing to ease these fears.</p>
      <p>“I will be writing to the Justice Minister and the Garda Commissioner to ensure that Mayo is not left behind when it comes to garda resources.”</p>
