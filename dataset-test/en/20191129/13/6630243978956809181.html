      <p>A court in South Africa has rejected an appeal by ex-president Jacob Zuma over his corruption trial.</p>
      <p>In a brief verdict on Friday, the High Court of Pietermaritzburg ruled Zumaâ€™s appeal inadmissable.</p>
      <p>The court also rejected the request for appeal filed by the French defense and electronics group, Thales in the same case.</p>
      <p>Zuma, who ruled South Africa between 2009 and 2018, is accused of receiving nearly 245,000 euros as kick-back for a huge arms contract worth 3 billion euros in 1999. He was then vice president.</p>
      <p>Zuma and Thales have repeatedly denied the allegations. Zuma and Thales still have the possibility to appeal to the Supreme Court and the Constitutional court, according to a legal expert who spoke to AFP.</p>
      <p>As at the time of filing this report, their lawyers have not announced any decision.</p>
