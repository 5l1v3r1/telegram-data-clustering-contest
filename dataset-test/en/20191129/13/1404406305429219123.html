      <p>Michael Franzese opened up to VladTV about why the mafia only exists in Italy, and he explained that the U.S. has a similar organization called La Cosa Nostra. He went on to explain that potential members of La Cosa Nostra have to have paternal Italian lineage, but Franzese added that they prefer that both the person's mother and father are Italian. </p>
      <p>During the conversation, Michael also spoke about the press hounding his father in the 1960s, and he added that he believes his father got more press than John Gotti during his heyday. To hear more, including Franzese recounting the story of 60 crime bosses being detained during a coincidence during a meeting in Apalachin, New York, hit the above clip.</p>
