      <h1>Black Friday: Beware these cyber scams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:06:03+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author">Brooke Crothers</a></address>
      <p>In the last few weeks, tens of thousands of potential scams involving brand names have been discovered, cybersecurity firms are warning.</p>
      <p>ZeroFOX identified 61,305 potential scams between Nov. 1 and Nov. 20, according to a <a href="https://www.zerofox.com/blog/2019-black-friday-scams/">report</a> that focused on 26 brands, including names like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/samsung">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/sony">Sony</a> and Tiffany.</p>
      <p>In a separate report, <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2019/11/26/november-shopping-do-it-the-smart-way/">Check Point</a> said that more than 1,700 domains, which look similar to the amazon.com domain have been registered in recent months. The sites, such as “amaz0n-jp[.]com,” are meant to mimic legitimate sites.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And in the first half of November, the use of e-commerce phishing websites has more than doubled since last November’s peak, up by 233 percent, Check Point said.</p>
      <p>The goal, like all scams, is to trick shoppers to input personal information in order to steal credit card data.</p>
      <p>The lure is fake gift cards or discounts and even charity-giving, ZeroFOX said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Keywords like “coupon” or “deal” or “free” are used to get shoppers’ attention. Then there is a “call to action” to try to get the victim to log in or verify an account, purportedly to get the reward, according to ZeroFOX.</p>
      <p>Scammers are active on social media with hashtags such as “#blackfriday” or “#cybermonday” or “#giveaway.”</p>
      <p>“This makes these posts more likely to be shown to social media users, based on the social platform’s algorithms, and also makes them searchable,” ZeroFOX said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Similarly, scammers may leverage fake accounts to like and share or retweet these scam posts, giving them more legitimacy,” the cybersecurity firm added.</p>
      <p>The bad guys also use Google Chrome extensions – small software programs that you install to customize how you browse – to spread malware.</p>
      <p>One Chrome extension had over 60,000 installs with dozens of negative reviews complaining about data theft and malware, ZeroFOX said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Black Friday invariably means a big spike in scams.</p>
      <p>“Legitimate giveaways rarely ask for anything more than an email address. A promotion requesting anything further is likely a scam,” ZeroFOX said.</p>
      <p>Also, be sure the URL, or web address, is legitimate. A rule of thumb that all cybersecurity experts advise is never clicking on a link in an email or text. Rather, go directly to the retailer’s or brand's website via your browser. And use special caution when interacting with promotional sites. “If a promotion sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” ZeroFOX said.</p>

      <p>Finally, consider using another email address – not your primary email – for promotional entries.</p>
