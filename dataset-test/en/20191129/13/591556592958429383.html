      <p>Law enforcement agencies from all over the world announced today they took down the infrastructure of the Imminent Monitor remote access trojan (IM-RAT), a hacking tool that has been on sale online for the past six years.<br/><br/>According to a <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/international-crackdown-rat-spyware-which-takes-total-control-of-victims%E2%80%99-pcs">press release from Europol</a>, the operation had two stages. The first occurred in June 2019, when Australian and Belgian police forces searched the homes of the IM-RAT author and one of his employees.<br/><br/>The second stage took place earlier this week, when authorities took down the IM-RAT website, its backend servers, and arrested the malware's author and 13 of the tool's most prolific users.<br/><br/>Europol reported arrests in Australia, Colombia, Czechia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>Authorities also served search warrants at 85 locations and seized 430 devices they believed were used to spread the malware.</p>
      <p>The UK National Crime Agency (NCA) <a href="https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/cyber-crime-site-selling-hacking-tool-taken-down-following-international-operation">took credit</a> for a good chunk of the bounty, with 21 search warrants, nine arrests, and more than 100 seized devices.</p>
      <h3>The story of Imminent Monitor RAT</h3>
      <p>The Imminent Monitor RAT was created back in 2013 by a malware author going by the name of Shockwave.</p>
      <p>It was <a href="https://www.veronicavaleros.com/blog/2018/3/12/a-study-of-rats-third-timeline-iteration">one of the many RATs</a> developed in the past two decades.</p>

      <p>Just like most shady RAT operations, the tool was promoted as a legitimate "remote management tool" meant for system administrators, yet, it was advertised on hacking forums exclusively for a particular niche of buyers -- namely, cyber-criminals.<br/><br/>The tool was not that popular in its early years, but as authorities arrested and took down other RATs (LuminosityLink, NanoCore, BlackShades, Orcus), new users flocked to IM-RAT over the past two years.</p>

      <p>For example, <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/non-russion-matryoshka-russian-service-centers-under-attack.html">in June 2018</a>, Fortinet detected a spike in IM-RAT usage, when it detected a campaign targeting Russian businesses.<br/><br/>At the technical level, IM-RAT was on par with the features offered in other RATs, and provided access to stuff like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Controlling a remote desktop "with hyper fast speeds exceeding 50 FPS"</li>
        <li>Controlling remote webcams "with speeds exceeding 60 FPS"</li>
        <li>A live keylogging feature</li>
        <li>Listening on real-time conversations via a computer's microphone</li>
        <li>The ability to use infected devices as proxies and hide the hacker's malicious actions against other targets</li>
        <li>Dumping passwords from a wide range of apps and stealing passwords</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The IM-RAT was advertised in places like HackForums and was distributed and sold via the now-seized <a href="https://imminentmethods.net/">imminentmethods.net</a> website, for only $25. <br/><br/>Europol said the tool had more than 14,500 buyers across 124 countries and had been used to infect tens of thousands of victims.<br/><br/>Once Europol started serving search warrants, seizing devices, and making arrests, the operation didn't go unnoticed, and several of the RAT's users warned the hacking community of the ongoing raid.</p>
