      <p>Families across the North East can get into the Christmas spirit by booking a magical train ride to meet Santa.</p>
      <p>Three railways - Tanfield, South Tynedale and Weardale - and one railway museum are hosting a series of rides throughout December where children can meet Santa and his little helpers at his grotto on the North Pole.</p>
      <p>Children will be able to meet Santa (providing they have been good) and let him know what they would like for Christmas this year, before collecting a small, free gift.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, due to the fact that they are massively popular year after year, both the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/tanfield-railway-north-pole-express-16202476">North Pole Express at Tanfield Railway</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/santa-train-rides-stephenson-railway-13512792">Stephenson Railway's Santa Specials</a> are completely sold out.</p>
      <p>You do still have two options though, both of which have good availability...</p>
      <h4>Santa Specials, South Tynedale Railway</h4>
      <p>Once you arrive at the station in Alston, you’ll be greeted by platform Elves who will direct you to the ticket office on platform 1 to collect your tickets and then help you to board your train.</p>
      <p>You’ll be able to join in with some carol singing on your journey and they will give you a spotter sheet with lots of things to look for as you travel through the wintry North Pennines behind one of the Railway's heritage steam locos.</p>
      <p>When you return to Alston, the Chief Elf will be there to lead you to Santa’s Grotto and while you wait your turn to see the famous man in red there will be crafts to keep you busy and seasonal refreshments to warm you up - all included in your ticket price.</p>
      <p>Santa Specials will depart South Tynedale Railway on December 7, 8, 14, 15 and 22, with morning and afternoon time slots available for all.</p>
      <p>You can book up via <a href="https://www.south-tynedale-railway.org.uk/santa-specials-dont-just-take-our-word-for-it/">the South Tynedale Railway website.</a></p>
      <h4>Train to Christmas Town, Weardale Railway</h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> trips made their debut at Weardale Railway in winter 2017 as it was confirmed that The Polar Express, the massively popular event at the railway wouldn't be returning.</p>
      <p>And you can book your seat on The Train to Christmas Town for 2019 right now. Arriving at Stanhope Station, you will collect your tickets from the ticket window then be transported into a seasonal wonderland.</p>
      <p>You’ll have chance to take advantage of the gift shop and Olde Worlde sweet cabin, or relax with a hot drink and a bite to eat.</p>

      <p>Delicious Christmas stew, pulled pork or maybe a hot dog are on the menu as you sit and wait for the train to arrive. Kids can pay a visit to the children’s corner where they can write a letter to post to Santa Claus or maybe hang a message on the Christmas Tree.</p>
      <p>Once the Weardale Railway Conductor makes his “all aboard” announcement you'll be ready to join the Train to Christmas Town, where magical elf folk are waiting to share the spirit of the season with everyone as they make way to collect Santa Claus.</p>
      <p>Each child will be greeted by Santa as he makes his way through the train and presents them with a special Train to Christmas Town gift.</p>
      <p>The energetic Dancing Elves will have the whole carriage singing and dancing along to your favourite Christmas songs all the way back to the station.</p>
      <p>The Train to Christmas Town trips will run at Weardale Railway from Saturday, November 23 until Christmas, with availability all the way up to December 23.</p>

      <p>The man himself will be revealing all at this fun event where another pertinent question being answered will be what do reindeers really want families to leave them to eat on Christmas Eve.</p>
