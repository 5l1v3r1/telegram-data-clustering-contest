      <p><b>MOSCOWÂ (AP)</b> - A group of lawmakers in the country's upper house of parliament, mainly from President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, have presented a long-anticipated bill on preventing domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>The draft law, released Friday by the Federation Council, gives domestic violence a legal definition and outlines various prevention measures, such as restraining orders.</p>
      <p>It comes two years after Russia decriminalized simple assault of family members, which was followed by cases of spousal and parental abuse.</p>
      <p>Domestic violence is rampant in Russia, where 40% of violent crimes occur in families.</p>
      <p>Women's rights advocates have actively campaigned for the bill, while conservative groups protested against it, arguing that interfering with family affairs undermines Russia's "traditional values."</p>
      <p>The bill is expected to be formally submitted to the parliament by the end of the year.</p>
