      <p>A good number of indigenous African tribes are believed to be the direct descendants of the earliest man and carry unique DNA markers. This feeds into the widely held belief that humans evolved from Africa millions of years ago.</p>
      <p>Throughout European civilization some Africans dropped some of their cultures and have taken up some westernised practices.</p>
      <p>However, there are seven indigenous African tribes that didn’t give in to westernisation. These tribes still maintain their cultural practices and traditions spanning thousands of years.</p>
      <p>They have unique genetic features and languages that are non-existent outside their circle. Check them out below.</p>
