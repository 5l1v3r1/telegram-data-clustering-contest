      <h1>Horrific injuries suffered by mother at centre of love triangle murder attempt revealed</h1>
      <h2>WARNING: Graphic image shows horrific injuries suffered by the woman at the centre of a love triangle between Alnwick Garden staff</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:11:20+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>These are the horrific injuries inflicted by a savage thug who tried to kill the mum he had been having an affair with.</p>
      <p>Brett Fenwick repeatedly knifed Louise Pearce in the face and neck during a sustained and terrifying attack which left her scarred for life.</p>
      <p>Fenwick had already stabbed Miss Pearce's long term partner in the neck after turning up at the couple's home in Alnwick with his brother, Blaine.</p>
      <p>After he fled the house in fear, he turned his blade on Miss Pearce in a "prolonged and vicious attack".</p>
      <p>The brothers were this week convicted of wounding with intent on Gareth Mallaburn and Brett Fenwick had already pleaded guilty to attempting to murder Miss Pearce.</p>

      <p>All three had been friends and worked at Alnwick Garden, Miss Pearce as a cleaner and the two men as kitchen porters.</p>
      <p>Now police, with the consent of Miss Pearce, have released a photograph of her injuries.</p>
      <p>After the case, Detective Constable Christopher Rogan said he believes both victims are lucky to be alive.</p>
      <p>Det Con Rogan said: "This has clearly been a hugely traumatic experience for both victims and  I can't stress enough how dignified they have been through this court process.</p>
      <p>“At some point in their lives, these people have been friends and it's hard to accept that someone you know could carry out such a violent attack on you. <br/><br/>"They both suffered horrendous injuries and are lucky to be alive.  Thankfully we don't see violent attacks like this every day but it needs to be made clear that any intent to commit such grievous harm is wholly unacceptable and can utterly destroy lives. <br/><br/>"I know that nothing will take away the pain and suffering Brett and Blaine Fenwick have caused their victims, but hopefully today will give them at least a small sense of justice and they can start move on from this ordeal.”</p>

      <p>Trouble flared after Brett Fenwick had an affair with Miss Pearce, who was in an 18-year relationship with Mr Mallaburn.</p>
      <p>After cleaner Miss Pearce's Bonfire Night revelation that she had cheated on the father of her three children, tensions brewed between the two men.</p>
      <p>Late on Boxing Day night last year, the bad feeling ended in a horrific attack when Brett and Blaine Fenwick turned up at the couple's home.</p>
      <p>The brothers launched an attack on Mr Mallaburn, who was stabbed in the neck before Brett turned a knife on his former lover, stabbing her in the neck and face repeatedly.</p>

      <p>Jurors were told Mr Mallaburn had previously considered Brett Fenwick a friend but he admitted being angry and shocked at the affair revelation and sent some threatening texts to him.</p>
      <p>Miss Pearce moved out for a time but they got back together and decided to try to repair their relationship.</p>
      <p>It was in the early hours of December 27 last year when the Fenwicks went to the couple's home on Howling Lane, in Alnwick after they had been out drinking.</p>
      <p>The court heard, they knocked on the door and when Miss Pearce answered, they pushed past her and ran upstairs, where Mr Mallaburn was.</p>
      <p>Mr Malllaburn was on the landing at the top of the stairs and Brett, followed by Blaine, ran upstairs shouting 'You b****** I'm going to kill you', the court heard.</p>
      <p>Mr Mallaburn barricaded himself into the bedroom as Brett shouted about the text messages his rival had sent, jurors were told.</p>
      <p>He felt blows on the door as he leaned on it then saw Brett's foot come through it.</p>
      <p>Realising the door was not going to withstand the attack, Mr Mallaburn armed himself with a shelf to defend himself and went out to confront the brothers, who he managed to push down the stairs.</p>
      <p>The court heard he thought the Fenwicks were going to leave and when they started arguing among themselves, Mr Mallaburn told them he could only listen to one of them at a time.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Mark Giuliani said: "What happened then was Brett took a knife out again and lunged towards Mr Mallaburn and stabbed him in the neck.</p>
      <p>"He pulled away but Brett tried to stab him again saying 'you don't know what I'm capable of, you want me to kill you, I will do it right now'."</p>

      <p>Mr Mallaburn managed to escape out of the back door and went to his mum's home.</p>
      <p>Mr Giuliani said: "At this point Brett Fenwick turned his violence towards the woman with whom he was having an affair and began shouting at her that she was pathetic and would never leave Mr Mallaburn.</p>
      <p>"Then he began to attack her, he stabbed her. She got outside and the attack continued outside."</p>
      <p>A neighbour who saw what happened will describe how Brett "executed a prolonged and vicious attack" on Miss Pearce.</p>
      <p>The court heard the Fenwicks deny going to the house armed with knives and Blaine claimed to police they were defending themselves.</p>
      <p>Brett Fenwick, 36, of Lower Barresdale, Alnwick, will be sentenced for attempting to murder Miss Pearce and wounding with intent on Mr Mallaburn, He was cleared of an allegation of having an article with a blade or point.</p>
      <p>Blaine Fenwick, 25, also of Lower Barresdale, Alnwick, was convicted of wounding with intent and cleared of two counts of having a bladed article.</p>
      <p>They will be sentenced on January 7.</p>
