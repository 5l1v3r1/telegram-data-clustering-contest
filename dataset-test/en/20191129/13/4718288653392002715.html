      <p>The Minister said: "I met some youngsters who told me that they will be able to use the stubble to produce mushrooms. In addition, the stubble is also being considered for making tiles."</p>
      <p>He said that the government was considering all the measures, including the stubble to used as fuel.</p>
      <p>"In the coming two-three years, there will be no problem of stubble burning, in this direction scientists of ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) are also looking for solutions," Chaudhary said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>On a question that all blame is being put on the farmers, the Minister said: "Unfortunately, the kind of politics that is happening in this country, it is the poor farmers who are feeling the heat. The Delhi government has failed to take steps to control pollution and is maligning the farmers instead. The problem of pollution is because of the stubble burning is not totally correct. Only three per cent pollution is happening because of this and the remaining 97 per cent is happening because of other causes. "</p>
      <p>He said that the Centre stands with the farmers and is working towards increasing their income by using the stubble in a constructive manner.</p>
      <p>Chaudhary said: "Farmers are being told how they can use the stubble to prepare the manure. Also, it can be used as fodder for cattle. Hence, the stubble will not be a problem, but a source of income for the farmers. "</p>
