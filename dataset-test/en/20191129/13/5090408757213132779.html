      <p>The two, who have a 1-year-old daughter, recently spoke about their sex life in an interview for <a href="https://playboy.com/read/kylie-jenner-travis-scott">Playboy</a>.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people claim that having a baby can hurt your sex life, but I feel like that’s the opposite of our experience,” Scott told Jenner.</p>
      <p>She agreed, saying she thinks the two of them have “definitely proven that rumor to be wrong.”</p>
      <p>“You remind me that motherhood and sexuality can coexist and just because you embrace your sexuality doesn’t mean you have loose morals or you’re not a good mother,” Jenner told Travis. “You can be sexy and still be a badass mom.”</p>

      <p>“The thing with sex is it used to feel so much more taboo. Even like when we were in the band [One Direction], the thought of people thinking that I had sex was like, ‘Oh no, that’s crazy, what if they know?'” he told Lowe.</p>
      <p>“Even just coming into this record I wanted to feel a little less guarded with stuff. I wanted to feel a lot freer and more joyful and honest,” he added.</p>
      <p>He also recently told Rolling Stone that his upcoming album “Fine Line” is <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-cover-interview-album-871568/">about “sex and feeling sad.”</a></p>

      <p>“We were under a blanket,” she shared. “We weren’t even in one of those pod things. I feel like we should get a trophy for that.”</p>

Does he have access to his office? Have a fantasy date. Be his secretary! Be sneaky. Your girlfriend’s house at a party. The bathroom! A guest bedroom! Just switch it up.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Miranda Kerr is now married to Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel, but before they exchanged vows, the model told The London Times in 2017 that <a href="http://www.insider.com/miranda-kerr-evan-spiegel-saving-themselves-for-marriage-2017-2">she and Spiegel were saving themselves for marriage</a>.</p>
      <p>The entire exchange started with a bizarre question about the couple’s contraception methods of choice, with Kerr (already a mom of one at the time) explaining that they don’t use any – because they don’t have sex.</p>
      <p>“Not until after we get married,” <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/miranda-kerr-sex-and-the-snapchat-ceo-the-life-of-a-frustrated-supermodel-9z70hhbtc">she clarified to The London Times</a>. “[Spiegel] is very traditional. We can’t … I mean we’re just … waiting.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>While doing a press tour for her movie “Red Sparrow,” Lawrence revealed to The Sun in 2018 that she <a href="http://www.insider.com/jennifer-lawrence-sti-std-testing-sex-2018-3">hasn’t had sex in a “very long time.”</a></p>
      <p>The reason? She’s extra-wary of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). And, apparently, penises.</p>
      <p>“I always talk like I want d—, but the truth is when I look back at my sexual past it was always with boyfriends,” the actress told The Sun. “I am mostly also a germaphobe. I have made it this far without an STI. D— is dangerous. If I was at the point where I could get an STI, doctors have already been involved. That is how much of a germaphobe I am.”</p>

      <h3>In 2017, Kate Upton said there are times when sex is off-limits.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s just not always the right time for sex. On a 2017 episode of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” Kate Upton talked about <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/831340/kate-upton-explains-why-there-is-no-sex-before-or-after-fiance-justin-verlander-s-baseball-games">when sex is off-limits for her and her husband Justin Verlander, who is an athlete.</a></p>
      <p>“There’s no sex before a game – absolutely none,” the supermodel told Cohen. “And also what I’ve found out is that if he plays well, there’s no sex after either. He’s exhausted! It’s kind of a buzzkill for me.”</p>

      <h3>Anna Farris has said masturbation isn’t so easy for her.</h3>

      <p>In her book “Unqualified,” Anna Faris opened up about her relationships with men and with herself, admitting that <a href="http://www.health.com/celebrities/anna-faris-unqualified">masturbation isn’t so easy for her</a>.</p>
      <p>“I love being intimate with my husband, but I have a lot of trouble being intimate with myself,” the actress wrote in her 2017 book. “I feel like getting myself off would force me to confront the things that terrify me about myself, and to face sexual desires I don’t even know I have. <a href="http://www.health.com/sex/secret-to-better-sex">Masturbation acknowledges your sexuality</a> in a way that we never did in my household, and while it was easy to get stoned in college and block out those childhood messages, as an adult I find it surprisingly difficult.”</p>

      <p>Losing your virginity can be exciting, but it can also be not-so-great. <a href="http://www.thefrisky.com/2008-04-15/frisky_quote_of_the_day_41508/">Ashton Kutcher’s first time was the latter</a>, or so he told Details in 2008.</p>
      <p>“It was out in the woods and it was horrible. It was a girl I’d just met who my buddy set me up with. The whole thing lasted like two seconds,” he said. “It was really awkward. Two years later I had sex with her again just to show her the first performance was fluke and I’d gotten better.”</p>

      <p>“I dated the guy for a long time [and then my mom] sent me a pair of underwear to try to, you know, womanhood. And they were called Olga, and I swear, the lace was about 3 1/2, 4 inches, and then the cotton part,” she added.</p>

      <p>“I am literally open to every single thing that is consenting and doesn’t involve an animal and everyone is of age,” she said. “Everything that’s legal, I’m down with.”</p>
