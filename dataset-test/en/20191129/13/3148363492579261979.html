      <p>Thomas Bowers, a former Deutsche Bank executive who is said to have approved some of the financial services company’s loans to President Donald Trump, committed suicide earlier this month, according to <a href="https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/deutsche-bank-death/"><i>Los Angeles Magazine</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Bowers, who headed up the bank’s U.S. wealth-management operations, reportedly supervised the president’s private banker, Rosemary Vrablic, a managing director at the firm. Of the various loans Deutsche Bank extended to President Trump was one for over $100 million to purchase the Trump National Doral in Miami, Florida. Upon Vrablic’s hiring in 2006, Bowers called her “one of the top private bankers to the U.S. ultra high-net-worth community.”</p>
      <p>Bowers departed Deutsche Bank in 2015 and later become COO of the Starwood Capital Group and a board member of the Opus Bank.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office <a href="https://mec.lacounty.gov/case-detail/?caseNumber=2019-08698">said</a> the 55-year-old business executive hung himself in Malibu.</p>
      <p>In April, two House committees <a href="https://apnews.com/a4a5259264dd47ac96d58f8e566fc2ac">subpoenaed</a> Deutsche Bank as part of a sweeping probe into President Trump’s previous financial activities, with a particular focus on his tax return records.</p>
      <p>At the time, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) stated that the subpoenas were designed to assist his panel’s review into allegations of “potential foreign influence” on U.S. elections. In a separate statement, House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) said of the probe that “the potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern.”</p>
      <p>In October, a federal appeals court <a href="https://apnews.com/95b25ecb634841b5a3a9823648ed14bc">confirmed</a> that Deutsche Bank was not in possession of President Trump’s tax return records. The president has <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/04/30/trumpsuesdeutschebank/">sued</a> in an attempt to prohibit House Democrats from obtaining the documents.</p>
