      <h4>Past Black Friday Sales On Steam</h4>
      <p>Previous Black Friday sales — or Steam Autumn Sales — have seen a wide array of games hit the digital discount bin, with AAA titles standing shoulder to shoulder with indie experiences. Last year, as <i><a href="https://www.wepc.com/news/steam-store-black-friday-deals/">WePC</a></i> details, a number of high-profile video games went on sale for the biggest shopping weekend in the United States.</p>
      <p>During the most recent Steam Autumn Sale, <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> was discounted by 34 percent to rest at just under $20, <i>Far Cry 5</i> was sold at 50 percent off for $29.99, and <i>Borderlands 2</i> was an absolute steal at just $4.99.</p>
      <p>Black Friday brings with it the opportunity to fill one’s backlog with even more games that may never be played, so don’t miss out on the significant sales and deep discounts that this year’s Steam Autumn Sale promises to deliver.</p>
