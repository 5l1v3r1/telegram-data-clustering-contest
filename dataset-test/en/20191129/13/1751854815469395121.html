      <p>A <a href="http://gizmochina.com/product/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-pro">Redmi Note 7 Pro</a> model has reportedly gone up in flames in China. Song Yujie, a citizen of Zhoukou, Henan Province logged a report on November 27 that the Redmi Note 7 Pro that he had purchased for his father and used for more than 3 months was “spontaneously ignited” while in use. The phone was purchased on July 24 from <a href="http://gizmochina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> Mall in China and the incident happened on October 29.</p>

      <p>According to the report, the phone was kept on a quilt with the father using it to play a video. The father had fallen asleep when he was awoken by the smell of something burning. He then noticed the smartphone was in flame. However, no further damage was done except for a charred device, burns to the quilt and a minor burn to Song’s father while trying to put out the flame. The picture provided by Song Yujie of the mobile phone after the fire showed that the entire mobile phone was broken down into several black parts after burning.</p>
      <h4>EDITOR’S PICK: <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/10/01/first-samples-from-the-100mp-mi-mix-alpha-is-here-we-are-not-impressed">First Samples from the 108MP Mi Mix Alpha is here &amp; we are not impressed!</a></h4>
      <p>A Xiaomi after-sales customer service personnel explained to reporters on November 28 that Mr Song’s mobile phone which was on fire was identified as “non-mobile phone quality problem”. This means the phone was on fire due to external reasons and wasn’t related to the quality of the phone. With such verdict, even though the Redmi Note 7 Pro comes with an 18-month warranty, the burnt phone isn’t covered by the warranty.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, this is similar to the case of Chavhan Ishwar whose <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/11/19/a-month-old-redmi-note-7s-goes-up-in-flames-but-xiaomi-india-wont-accept-liability/">one-month-old Redmi Note 7S went up in flames</a> while left idle at his office desk. Xiaomi India’s response is also similar. Such incidence and Xiaomi’s response are serious causes for concern and raise several key questions. Is Xiaomi compromising quality to keep its phone prices down? Are Xiaomi customer service personnel just plain incompetent or the company is simply evading liability by blaming external forces when its phones go up in flames?</p>
