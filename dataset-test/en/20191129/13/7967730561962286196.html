      <h1>Energy reduction for town planning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonald</a></address>
      <p>Town planning covers everything from pool safety, landscaping and multiple construction details etc. but nowhere does it provide for simple energy-reduction methods.</p>
      <p>We all know to switch off lights and appliances and self-monitor our daily electrical use but understanding that air-conditioning is the largest user of electricity is still not common knowledge.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that high-density construction in either apartments or attached housing maximises the use of electricity through air conditioning in these climates. The gains to government from this town planning is of course great on many fronts but push the expansion of energy production and fly in the face of reducing the energy load.</p>

      <p>Black or dark roofs may be a fashion statement but draw and retain a huge heat load from the sun, creating the need for increased air conditioning. Red roofs or light-coloured roofs, which provide solar reflection, should be specified.</p>
      <p>Buildings without eaves allow for the sunâ€™s maximum penetration, requiring greater air-conditioning. Eaves limit the sun entry, keeping the property cooler.</p>
      <p>Insulating mediums laid on ceiling panels are good for reducing heat loss from the living area and minor reduction in heat entry, especially in a cold climate. These methods do little to reduce the living space heat in a hot climate, for a prolonged period, as the heat will have already entered the ceiling space.</p>
      <p>The correct method of insulation is reflective foil fitted at the underside of the roof beams. This reflects the heat back to the roof, reducing heat entry to the ceiling space.</p>
      <p>Electric hot water services operate 24/7 whether a home is occupied or not and continue to operate even when not in use. Instantaneous gas hot water is available only as required and solar hot water produces free hot water without production impact.</p>
      <p>Electric cooking appliances, although improved in performance, are slow to change temperature and therefore cook. Gas is far quicker and for that reason cheaper.</p>
      <p>Green space tends to be focused on hills and housing estates generally situated in the valleys or on the flat. This should actually be executed in reverse. The houses on the hills can take advantage of the breezes, reducing the heat load and the green space would flourish more in the protected valleys.</p>
      <p>In 1986, the founders of Eco E identified that energy demand would have a major impact on the world by the turn of the century. They recognised that this increasing demand would have an adverse and dramatic impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>While many scientific organisations and government agencies globally focused on the development of environmentally friendly energy production methods, the founders took a simple view. They focused on the development of innovative products and systems which minimised energy use to create a reduced demand.</p>
