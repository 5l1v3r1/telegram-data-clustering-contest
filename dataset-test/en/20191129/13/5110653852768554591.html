      <h1>Ole Miss pisses away the Egg Bowl to Mississippi State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:02:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gatto</a></address>
      <p>The Egg Bowl rivalry game between Ole Miss and Mississippi State is one of the most hate-filled in the nation. It leads players to taunt their opponents . . . like how Ole Miss playerElijah Moore did Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bad Rebel. Bad.</p>
      <p>Ole Miss had drawn to a point behind the Bulldogs in the closing seconds of regulation on Moore's receiving touchown, but Moore decided that wasn't good enough. He tried to celebrate by making like a dog and doing the old pee tauntâ€” right in front of an official.</p>
      <p>Out came the flag, back went the kicking team 15 yards for the extra-point try (a 2-point attempt for the win was no longer a good option) and, well, let's just say: College kickers, man.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"Just disappointed," Ole Miss coach Matt Luke told reporters after the game (per <a href="https://twitter.com/samariaterry/status/1200273760584007681">Jackson, Miss., TV station WJTV</a>). "It's not who we are. We've been a disciplined team all year and (I'm) just disappointed that it happened. . . . Elijah's a good kid. He got caught up in the moment."</p>
      <p>Mississippi State gets the win, Moore gets all the online abuse he deserves and Ole Miss, which isn't bowl-eligible after a 4-8 season,gets to live with the stink of this for a whole year.</p>
