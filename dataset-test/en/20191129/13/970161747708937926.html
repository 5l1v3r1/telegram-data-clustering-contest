      <p>The mother of a man who beat his puppy to death cheered as her son was jailed after joining animal rights protesters in court.</p>
      <p>Jon-Luc McLoughlin, 26, savagely punched 11-month-old Alsatian Lexi to death before dumping her body near some trees, which traumatised children later found.</p>
      <p>His sentencing hearing was attended by around 25 animal rights campaigners and among them was the defendant’s mother and half-brother.</p>
      <p>McLoughlin, from Poole, Dorset, was jailed for 16 weeks but his sibling, Alec Mackay said the sentence wasn’t long enough.</p>
      <p>McLaughlin was also banned from owning animals for the rest of his life – a decision which was greeted with cheers from protesters, some of whom wore T-shirts with the words ‘Justice for Lexi’ printed on them.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘My mum is grateful that he has gone down but I don’t think 16 weeks is long enough. If anything it should have been a year minimum.</p>

      <p>‘If it was a human he would have gone down for a lot longer. We are all living creatures so he deserved to get more. I hope the dog comes back and bites him on his a**e.’</p>

      <p>Poole Magistrates’ Court heard that McLoughlin had only owned Lexi for around a month before he killed her in a fit of rage.</p>
      <p>During a police interview he initially lied by saying Lexi had been hit by a car but later confessed to killing her.</p>
      <p>Matthew Knight, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: ‘He punched the dog to death and dumped the body in some trees near his home.</p>
      <p>‘It was found by locals and upset local children who saw it. She had a laceration to her liver, blood in her abdomen and a stomach tear.</p>
      <p>‘It is likely that the dog did not survive for long.’</p>
      <p>When brought in for questioning, McLoughlin told officers: ‘I get very angry and I don’t know what came over me’.</p>

      <p>James Moore, mitigating, said that the defendant was a ‘deeply troubled individual’ and asked for him to be offered rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘We are a nation of animal lovers and this has caused a lot of anger in the whole community.</p>
      <p>‘He lost control and acted in blind rage. We all to some extent sometimes lose control and regret it.</p>
      <p>‘Mr McLoughlin has done that in a significant way and will have to live with that. However, he has not done it because he is depraved, he has done it because he is a deeply troubled individual.’</p>
      <p>McLaughlin pleaded guilty to a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal at a previous hearing.</p>

      <p>Judge Stephen Nichols said: ‘Taking everything into account this warrants an immediate custodial sentence. This was a savage attack on Lexi.’</p>

      <p>Michelle Sheriff, who led the animal rights campaign, said: ‘Lexi needed a voice and we were here for her. These things cannot be tolerated.</p>
      <p>‘I would have liked to have seen him get more but it’s better than no prison at all.’</p>
      <p>Graham Hammond, an RSPCA officer who investigated the case, said: ‘The man has a history of lashing out and we now feel we have got justice for that dog.</p>
      <p>‘It sends a message to other people that these animals are protected and you need to look after them.</p>
      <p>‘Any abuse to an animal is shocking especially when it leads to a death like this.</p>
      <p>‘I suppose in some ways it is even more sad that it is a younger animal but whenever an pet is murdered it is incredibly shocking.’</p>
      <p>Elisa Allen, a spokesman for fellow animal rights charity PETA, added: ‘Anyone capable of beating a puppy to death is likely to pose a serious threat to all living, feeling beings.</p>

      <p>‘While PETA is relieved that this man is banned from keeping animals for life, it’s imperative that, in addition to his incarceration, he undergo counselling.</p>
      <p>‘His anger-management and other psychological issues need to be addressed before he’s released back into society.’</p>
      <p>McLoughlin was also told to pay a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
