      <h1>USD/INR Technical Analysis: Eases from weekly tops, up little around 71.60 region</h1>

      <p>The USD/INR cross built on the previous session's recovery move from near three-week lows and gained some follow-through traction on the last trading day of the week.</p>
      <p>Bulls, however, failed to capitalize on the early uptick to fresh weekly tops, albeit the pair has still managed to hold with modest daily gains post-Indian GDP growth figures.</p>
      <p>The intraday positive momentum faltered near a <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> marked by the top end of a descending trend-channel, extending through the recent swing high near the 72.35-40 region.</p>
      <p>The mentioned barrier also nears the 23.6% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> retracement level of the 70.50-72.37 positive move and should now act as a key pivotal point for short-term bullish traders.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, immediate support is pegged near the 71.45 region (50% Fibo.), which if broken might accelerate the slide back towards weekly lows – around the 71.25-20 region.</p>
      <p>The latter coincides with 61.8% Fibo. level and is closely followed by the trend-channel support, below which the cross seems all set to head towards testing the 70.85 horizontal support.</p>
