      <p>It was Thanksgiving Day 2018 when investigators say Christopher Lee robbed the Murphyâ€™s Express in Oakland and opened fire on responding deputies.</p>
      <p>Deputy Jimmy Pardue was struck but survived his injuries.</p>
      <p>Police said Lee then ran to a nearby Texaco station and stole a Mercury Grand Marquis. Memphis officers picked up the pursuit as Lee crossed into the city limits on Highway 64.</p>
      <p>The police video shows Lee losing control near Rockcreek Parkway, and the stolen car flipping over before landing in the middle of traffic.</p>
      <p>Officers surrounded Lee and took him into custody. He was taken to the hospital but was not seriously injured.</p>
      <p>Lee pleaded guilty in Fayette County last summer before the case went to trial.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to26 years for attempted 2nd degree murder, carjacking, aggravated robbery, theft of property and weapons violations, according to District Attorney General Mark Davidson.</p>
