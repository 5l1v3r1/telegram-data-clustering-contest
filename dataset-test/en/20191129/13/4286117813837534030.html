      <p>India's Gross Domestic Product (<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/gross-domestic-product-growth-falls-4-5-per-cent-q2-2019-20-1623733-2019-11-29">GDP) growth slipped further to hit an over six-year low of 4.5 per cent</a> in July-September. As soon as the GDP numbers were released, the Opposition attacked the Central government over the recent GDP data. Congress was one of the first ones to target the government over the slipping economic growth of the country.</p>
      <p>Taking a dig at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, "India's GDP has collapsed to an abysmal 4.5%. We are in a virtual free-fall. This is the lowest GDP quarter in 6 years. But why is the BJP celebrating? Because their understanding of GDP ( Godse Divisive Politics) suggests double-digit growth levels. All in the perspective!"</p>

      <p>Siraj Hussain, former secretary to the government, said 4.5 per cent is bad news and the Central government need to give this a serious thought. "4.5% is bad news, this means there are no jobs and it really doesn't bode well for the country, the government needs to give this a very serious thought," he said.</p>

      <p>Trinamool Congress Derek O'Brien said, "Lowest GDP growth in 26 quarters! No answers from FM. No wonder, full Opposition walked out of Rajya Sabha 40 minutes into the FM’s speech this week. And ministers dozed off in their seats #Parliament."</p>

      <p>Speaking at the National Economy Conclave, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury referred to the recent GDP numbers and said, "This is the New India. This government wants a Hindu Rashtra which they want to do keeping states at bay."</p>
      <p>"FM says this is not a recession, then what is the solution? The economy is the county won't do better until there is public pressure. It is complete one-way traffic, no consultation. An authoritative govt which doesn't want to listen to anyone," he said.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the economic conclave, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the economic condition of the country is "worrisome". "The economic condition is worrisome. I will talk today as a concerned citizen and as an economist," he said.</p>

      <p>"This is clearly unacceptable. Aspiration of our country is to grow at 8-9%. A sharp decline in GDP from 5% in Q1 to 4.5% in Q2 is worrisome. Mere changes in economic policies will not help revive the economy," Manmohan Singh said.</p>

      <p>Attacking the Central government further, Sitaram Yechury said, "This government is in denial they don't know what to do. The government just knows how to whip emotion and they do they to win votes but now with 4.5 per cent people are getting to know the truth. My advice to the government is: give money into the hands of the common people and stop helping your rich friends, that won't help the economy."</p>
