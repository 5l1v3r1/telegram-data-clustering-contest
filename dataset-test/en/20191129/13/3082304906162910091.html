        <b>Borussia Dortmund intend to move on from Jadon Sancho’s recent problems, says Michael Zorc.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jadon Sancho’s issues at Borussia Dortmund have been dealt with and a January departure is not expected, insists sporting director Michael Zorc.</p>
      <p>Sancho is Dortmund’s star man but has endured a difficult spell this month, as he was hauled off in the first half of a 4-0 Klassiker rout at the hands of Bayern Munich and then started on the bench against Barcelona in midweek.</p>
      <p>Under-fire coach Lucien Favre claimed he preferred to select players who are “focused and ready”, although the England international scored after coming on.</p>
      <p>However, Zorc is confident Dortmund have managed the issue, meaning Sancho – linked with a host of top clubs, including Manchester United – should remain at Signal Iduna Park at least until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>“We’ve cleared everything internally in the team and with the player,” Zorc told a news conference on Friday ahead of the trip to Hertha Berlin.</p>
      <p>“It’s done, we’re looking forward. Jadon is another regular player and he is part of our team.</p>

      <p>“I believe that when he came on against Barcelona, ​​we witnessed a good response and he did a very good job.</p>
      <p>“I do not have the impression that he wants to prepare for a January move. We talked to him and his agency. We hope he shows his best possible performance tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>Zorc also reiterated his backing of Favre, who has Dortmund sixth in the Bundesliga and winless in three in all competitions.</p>
      <p>“Everything has already been said,” Zorc said. “We have faith in Lucien, he works very hard and wants to reverse the trend.</p>
      <p>“We believe he can do it in this situation, we stay in the reality and do not go into speculation.”</p>
