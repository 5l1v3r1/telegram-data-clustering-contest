      <h1>Arsene Wenger's lesson to Freddie Ljungberg on how to treat Arsenal players</h1>
      <h2>The Swede has taken over from Unai Emery on an interim basis after the sacking of the Spaniard on Friday morning amid Arsenal's worst run in 27 years</h2>

      <p>Freddie Ljungberg is highly likely to lean on his experiences with Arsene Wenger as he gets to grips with his new job as Arsenal's interim manager.</p>
      <p>The Swede was named as the new temporary boss on Friday following the sacking of Unai Emery, who had been presiding over the Gunners' worst run of form for 27 years.</p>
      <p>Thursday night's 2-1 loss at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League made it seven successive games without a win, and the axe fell on the former Sevilla and Paris Saint-Germain boss around 12 hours later.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg is an extremely popular figure with the club's players having been promoted from his role with the under-23s prior to this season.</p>

      <p>In that previous position he presided over Arsenal's campaign in the Checkatrade Trophy, and it was after a heavy 6-2 loss to Cheltenham Town in October last year that Ljungberg revealed some advice Wenger gave him on criticising players.</p>
      <p>“First of all I told them, quite sternly, that that’s what happens in a game like this," Ljungberg told the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/freddie-ljungberg-adopts-the-arsene-wenger-approach-after-arsenal-u21s-suffer-heavy-defeat-a3976596.html">Evening Standard</a> after a match in which Robbie Burton was sent off.</p>
      <p>"Then I tried to explain to them a little the mistakes we’d made.</p>

      <p>“But often after a game - maybe I was told by Arsene a bit - (you realise) you don’t always see the correct things on the bench.</p>
      <p>"Before I go and point fingers at players I like to go and see the videos because there could be different angles.</p>

      <p>“I like to be clear if I want to make a point to someone. I try to be calm after games and have a discussion 24-48 hours later.”</p>
      <p>The Gunners' first-team will hope that Ljungberg has little need for this approach in his new role, as the club target an upturn in form.</p>
