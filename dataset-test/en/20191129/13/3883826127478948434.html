        <b>The owner of the Daily Mail, DMGT, has bought the i newspaper and website for £49.6m from JPI Media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>DMGT chairman Lord Rothermere said the paper was "a highly respected publication with a loyal and engaged readership".</p>
      <p>"We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high-quality and politically independent editorial style."</p>
      <p>The Competition and Markets Authority will have to approve the deal.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the i reported an operating profit of £11m from £34m in sales.</p>
      <p>The deal means that the paper will have its fourth owner in as many years.</p>
      <p>The sale was attacked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said in a tweet that two billionaires now owned half the UK's top 10 daily newspapers.</p>

      <h3>'Time-poor' readers</h3>
      <p>The i was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to the Independent. It sells for 65p on weekdays and £1.20 on Saturdays.</p>
      <p>When it first hit the newsstands, executives at the company said it was aimed at "time-poor newspaper readers", especially commuters, who lacked the time to read a quality newspaper on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>At its launch, it shared the same editorial staff as its sister paper and was seen as a way of extending the Independent's brand to a new market.</p>
      <p>But in 2016, the Independent closed its print edition and the i was sold for £24m to Johnston Press.</p>
      <p>Despite this, links to the paper's former parent remained, with the i continuing to provide a print home for some of the Independent's now otherwise digital-only content.</p>
      <h3>Changing hands</h3>
      <p>In November 2018, the i changed hands again after Johnston Press was bought out of administration by JPI Media.</p>
      <p>DMGT had been mulling the purchase for at least a year, but was beaten by JPI Media's deal with administrators.</p>
      <p>Johnston Press was one of the largest local and regional newspaper organisations in the UK with a history dating back more than 250 years, but it had debts of £220m.</p>
      <p>The deal leaves JPI with The Scotsman and Yorkshire Post among its biggest titles. In total, it owns about 200 newspaper brands.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Who owns the UK's national newspapers?</h3>
      <p>If the DMGT deal is approved, the UK's national newspapers will be owned by just six companies.</p>
      <p><b>DMGT </b>already owns the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro.</p>
      <p><b>Reach</b>, formerly known as Trinity Mirror, owns the Daily Mirror, Sunday People, Daily Express, Daily Star and associated Sunday titles.</p>
      <p><b>News UK</b>, which is part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, News Corp, owns the Times, Sunday Times and Sun.</p>
      <p>The <b>Telegraph Media Group, </b>owned by billionaire brothers Sir Fredrick and Sir David Barclay, owns the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph.</p>
      <p>The <b>Guardian Media Group</b> owns the Guardian and Observer.</p>
      <p>And the Financial Times is owned by Japanese media firm <b>Nikkei</b>, after being sold by UK publishing group Pearson in 2015.</p>
