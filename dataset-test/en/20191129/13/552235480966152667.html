      <p>A comprehensive inspection is to be carried out on memorial headstones throughout Perth and Kinross.</p>
      <p>Starting on Monday, January 6, 2020 all memorials in Perth and Kinross Council-run sites will be tested in line with the Scottish Government’s guidance on memorial safety.</p>
      <p>The extensive programme of memorial headstone inspections will start in Blair Atholl and Perth’s Jeanfield cemeteries.</p>
      <p>Headstone inspections will be fully recorded and any headstones that fail the test and are deemed to be unsafe will be laid flat or fenced off and the lair owner advised of the inspection outcome.</p>
      <p>Should it not be possible to trace the lair’s owner, the headstone will be made safe by digging it partially into the ground, to ensure it is not damaged or causes further hazard to users and visitors to the cemetery.</p>
      <p>Following the works on the first two sites, the next cemeteries to be inspected will be in Auchterarder, Blairgowrie, Dunkeld, Dunning, Meigle and Muthill, with details of further checks to be announced by Perth and Kinross Council in due course.</p>
      <p>A council spokesperson said: “The council appreciates that any works within cemeteries to make headstones safe may be upsetting to some people, and would wish to apologise in advance if this is the case.</p>
      <p>“All checks will be carried out by qualified professional officers who will ensure these are done with the utmost respect.</p>
      <p>“Any works required will be carried out professionally and respectfully.</p>
      <p>“We would encourage lair owners to advise our bereavement services of any change in lair ownership or change of address, so that they can be easily contacted, should this be required.</p>
      <p>“The condition of any memorial headstone is ultimately the responsibility of the lair owner, and therefore we would recommend that family memorials are regularly inspected by a suitably qualified person to ensure they are in a condition which does not present a public safety hazard.</p>
      <p>“Prior to any inspections taking place, notices will be displayed in the relevant cemetery and community councils and local councillors will be contacted.</p>
      <p>“Information will also be made available via the council’s website and on its social media channels four weeks before any headstone works take place.”</p>
      <p>Those with queries about the works or who need more information are asked to call Perth and Kinross Council’s customer service centre on 01738 475000.</p>
