      <p>Cape Town - <b>Conor McGregor</b> will return to the UFC octagon for the first time in over a year when he faces <b>Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone</b> in Las Vegas on January 18, 2020.</p>
      <p>According to the <b>BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/mixed-martial-arts/50595995">website</a></b>, the 31-year-old Irishman has not competed since <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/mixed-martial-arts/45775001">losing to Russian Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month McGregor was convicted of assault following an altercation in a Dublin pub in April, and fined 1 000 .</p>
      <p>His return will be part of UFC 246 and UFC president Dana White confirmed: "Conor has signed and Cowboy is ready to go."</p>
      <p>McGregor has a 21-4 record in UFC and in 2016 became the first fighter to hold belts in two weight categories at the same time.</p>
      <p>American Cerrone, 36, lost his last fight in the first round to Justin Gaethje in September.</p>
