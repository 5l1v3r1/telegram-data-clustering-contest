        <i>“Nuno Espirito Santo is the priority of #Arsenal to replace Emery. The discussions have already begun with his entourage. The Portuguese coach is very interested. In case of agreement, Arsenal will have to compensate the Wolves.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Bouhafsi reports that Nuno remains interested in taking the job at the Emirates Stadium, despite dodging the questions related to it during recent press conferences. The Gunners, however, will have to pay Wolves a compensation fee if they are to release him from his contract.</p>
      <p>Arsenal next face Norwich City in the Premier League and are looking to end a winless run of seven games across all competitions.</p>
