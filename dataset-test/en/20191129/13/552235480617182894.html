      <p>Striking university staff say they have received “fantastic support” on the Dumfries picket line.</p>
      <p>Lecturers and academic staff belonging to the UCU union walked out on strike at the Crichton campus on Monday.</p>
      <p>A number of universities, including Glasgow, Strathclyde and St Andrews, have been hit by the all out action.</p>
      <p>The Standard told on Tuesday how classes have been cancelled at the University of Glasgow’s base in the town amidst the action.</p>
      <p>Dr Benjamin Franks, of the University and College Union, said: “The support here has been fantastic. Most of the classes have been cancelled but we are running education events off campus which have been well-attended.</p>
      <p>“The students came down to the picket and joined in with their own banners in support. In the broad scale of things, I believe the employers have agreed to enter negotiations. None of us wanted to take strike action but the stress and strain has resulted in it. The success of the education events we have been running show that while education requires students and lecturers, they do not need university managers. They need us but we don’t need them.”</p>
      <p>Staff are striking over pensions, pay and conditions.</p>
      <p>They say salaries have dropped in real terms and there has been a rise in zero hours contracts in the sector.</p>
      <p>The University of Glasgow ballot had a turnout of less than 57 per cent, with 563 eligible members voting for the action, against 232 opposed. There are 1418 UCU members amongst the university’s academic and support staff.</p>
      <p>Staff from some universities are striking only on the grounds of pay and conditions. The University of the West of Scotland, which also has a base at Crichton, are not staging industrial action.</p>
      <p>The action began last Monday and is due to run until next Wednesday.</p>
