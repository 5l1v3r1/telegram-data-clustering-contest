      <p>The unofficial brother of Menzgold CEO Nana Appiah Mensah aka NAM identified as Stanley Kodia but known on social media as KOD has revealed that rich man Ibrah One is wanted in German and the United States.</p>
      <p>Ibrah One has for some time now been on the neck of NAM 1 since the BoG and SEC closed down NAM’s Menzgold last year.</p>
      <p>Recently, Ibrah One came out again to say that NAM 1 intentionally set fire into his Zylofon media building just to make people have pity on him so he doesn’t pay his aggrieved customers.</p>
      <p>KOD who is also a customer of Menzgold took his social media page to accuse Ibrah of being a fraudster and a big-time scammer as well as a mad person who is trying to remain relevant in the media after he was disgraced by a colleague identified as Heloo.</p>
