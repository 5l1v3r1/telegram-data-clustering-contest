      <h1>Dumfries friends launch coat campaign to help needy over Christmas</h1>
      <h2>The idea came out about after Gillian saw similar projects being set up to help people struggling with the freezing temperatures elsewhere - and thought it could be brought to the region.</h2>

      <p>Two big-hearted Dumfries friends are aiming to help those less fortunate over Christmas by organising a winter coat appeal.</p>
      <p>Gillian Marley-Milligan and Denise Fuller are running the collection which has already attracted a great response from kind locals keen to help out.</p>
      <p>All of the coats will eventually be donated to the Salvation Army in Dumfries, which will ensure that they are distributed to those struggling with the freezing temperatures.</p>
      <p>Gillian told the Standard: “It first came about because I saw posts on Facebook from Glasgow about people trying to collect coats up there and thought about the needy people down here who could be helped as well.</p>
      <p>“I approached the foodbank in Buccleuch Street and in the Friars’ Vennel but they couldn’t take the coats, but the local Salvation Army was very keen so we’re helping them out.</p>
      <p>“I just put a post up to see what the response would be and it’s been unbelievable so far with people bringing in items and others offering to take coats in from people.</p>
      <p>“We’ve now got people collecting in Glencaple, Castle Douglas and Lockerbie, as well as at Mrs Howat’s Vintage Pantry in Dumfries.”</p>
      <p>The appeal welcomes coats of any size and donations of other winter clothing items such as hats and scarves are also welcome.</p>
      <p>Gillian added: “I’ve got about 20-30 bags downstairs in my house at the moment and I’m picking up more every day it seems with people coming to us.</p>
      <p>“We’ve still got a few weeks left until Christmas and so we’re hoping for a wee push and then it’ll be a case of trying to organise everything into size order.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely ignited a bit of a fire under me to try something like this again, but maybe with toiletries or helping out the local foodbanks in some way.”</p>
      <p>If anyone wishes to help out with the collection, they can message Gillian or Denise via Facebook for drop-off locations or further details about the appeal.</p>
