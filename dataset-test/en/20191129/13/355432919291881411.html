      <p>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi on Monday said he would step down as anti-government protests continue to roil the country.</p>
      <p>Abdul-Mahdi released a statement saying he will submit his letter of resignation, <a href="https://apnews.com/c1aaa0b3b0ff4f4c860b781bdb1da25c?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">The Associated Press reported</a>. His decision comes a little over a year after he took office.</p>
      <p>He said he would also submit a letter to the Iraqi parliament asking for the current government to resign, according to the AP.</p>
      <p>The announcement follows another day of unrest that saw security forces kill 40 people in Baghdad and other parts of the country. The previous day, protesters had burned the Iranian consulate. </p>
      <p>Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed amid clashes between authorities and demonstrators, who are protesting corruption within the Tehran-backed government. </p>
