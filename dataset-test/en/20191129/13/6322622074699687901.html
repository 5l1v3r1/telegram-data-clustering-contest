      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 29): Lion Industries Bhd reported a net loss of RM110.62 million for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (1QFY20) versus a net profit of RM19 million a year ago, including a lower margin of its steel division, and higher loss from associated companies and joint ventures.</p>
      <p>This marks its fourth consecutive quarterly loss.</p>
      <p>As a result, it registered a loss per share of 16.25 sen from 2.79 sen for 1QFY19, Lion Industries said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Revenue fell 29% to RM656.4 million from RM926.31 million last year due to lower revenue registered by its steel division.</p>
      <p>Its steel division reported a loss from operations of RM76.6 million against a profit of RM33.3 million last year, due to narrower profit margin. Revenue for the segment declined 29% to RM580.11 million from RM818.83 million.</p>
      <p>The building materials division posted a higher profit of RM1 million from RM76,000 last year on higher revenue of RM114.74 million, a 56% growth from RM73.7 million previously.</p>
      <p>Its profit from other segments, which consists of sales of lubricants, automotive and petroleum products and the provision of management services and property development projects, reported a loss of RM1.13 million against a profit of RM1.96 million a year ago. Revenue for the segment fell 18% to RM30.98 million from RM37.77 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>On prospects, the group said the operating environment of the steel industry is anticipated to face increasing challenges in view of the heightening global economic and geopolitical uncertainties.</p>
      <p>It added that the prices of steel products and raw materials remain volatile while demand from the construction and property sectors remains low.</p>
      <p>“The group will stay vigilant and responsive to market changes and improve its operating performance for the next quarter,” it said.</p>
      <p>Lion Industries' shares closed one sen or 3.13% higher at 33 sen, bringing it a market capitalisation of RM224.67 million. It saw some 1.2 million shares done.</p>
