        <b>Fabinho will miss Liverpool’s December schedule, including their Club World Cup campaign, due to ankle ligament damage.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool will be without Fabinho until the new year due to ankle ligament damage sustained during the 1-1 Champions League draw against Napoli, the Premier League leaders have confirmed.</p>
      <p>The Brazil midfielder made way after 18 minutes of Wednesday’s match at Anfield and must now sit out a potentially pivotal period of the Reds’ campaign.</p>
      <p>“Further assessment on the injury has discovered Fabinho will be out of action until the new year,” a club statement read.</p>
      <p>“The Brazilian will begin a rehabilitation programme with the Reds’ medical team at Melwood as he works his way back to full fitness.”</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side will battle across four fronts over the next month, defending an eight-point lead at the Premier League summit.</p>

      <p>A share of the spoils in midweek means they head to Salzburg on December 10 with qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League still on the line.</p>
      <p>A scratch squad will take on Aston Villa in the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup on December 17, a day before Liverpool begin their Club World Cup bid in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Since joining for a reported initial fee of £39million in May 2018, Fabinho has established himself as a crucial part of Klopp’s side – an integral performer in the holding midfield role.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he is yet to finish on the losing side in a Premier League game he has started, having come on as a second-half substitute during January’s 2-1 defeat to champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Liverpool host Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday before welcoming Everton for the first Merseyside derby of the season next Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Leicester City, who are second in the table, entertain the Reds at the King Power Stadium on Boxing Day in what will be a first game back in England following their Club World Cup exertions.</p>
