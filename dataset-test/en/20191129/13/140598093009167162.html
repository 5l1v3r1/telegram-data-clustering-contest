      <h1>K-pop star jailed for six years for gang rape and spycam crimes </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:40:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/agence-france-presse/" target="_blank">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>South Korean K-pop singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young was convicted on Friday of gang rape, as well as secretly filming and distributing illicit sex videos of his partners, and jailed for six years.</p>
      <p>Jung and Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of boy band FT Island, were found guilty of gang-raping two different victims on two occasions in 2016.</p>
      <p>Separately, 30-year-old Jung was also convicted of filming himself having sex with other women without their knowledge and sharing the footage 11 times without their consent.</p>
      <p>It is the highest-profile example of an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/21/south-korean-women-demand-equal-justice-internet-sex-crimes/">epidemic of spycam crimes in South Korea</a>, which have prompted widespread anger and seen women demonstrating in Seoul, chanting: "My life is not your porn".</p>

      <p>Jung distributed his videos in mobile chatrooms with recipients including fellow K-pop star Seungri of BIGBANG, who has been accused of illegal gambling in connection with a sex and drugs scandal.</p>

      <p>Jung was jailed for six years and Choi, 29, for five, Yonhap news agency cited the Seoul Central District Court as saying.</p>
      <p>"Jung and Choi took part in gang rape of victims who were intoxicated and unable to resist," the verdict said, rejecting the defendants' claim the sex was consensual.</p>
      <p>"It is hard to fathom the extent of suffering the victims must have gone through."</p>
      <p>The defendants had perceived the victims only as "sexual objects" to be exploited, it added, and "a heavy punishment is inevitable given the gravity of offences".</p>
      <p>Both men broke down in tears when the sentences were announced.</p>
      <p>Jung rose to fame in 2014 when he came third in the audition show "Super Star K" and had a number of solo hits before the scandal emerged in March, when he announced his retirement.</p>
      <p>Known as "molka", spycam videos are largely made by men secretly filming women in schools, toilets and elsewhere, although the term can also be applied to clandestinely-shot footage of consensual sex.</p>
      <p>In the conservative South, women who appear in such videos will feel deep shame despite being the victims and face the threat of ostracism and social isolation.</p>
      <p>Around 5,500 people were arrested for molka offences last year, 97 percent of them men, according to police data.</p>
