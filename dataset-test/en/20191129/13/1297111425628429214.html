      <p>The CEO of Agribition says a rodeo clown’s joke about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau being struck by a bus was inappropriate and not reflective of the event’s values.</p>
      <p>The joke was made by Dennis Halstead, a well-known rodeo clown from Okotoks, Alta., during his performance Wednesday at Agribition’s opening night of the Maple Leaf Finals Rodeo in Regina. According to a tweet posted by Regina resident Megan McCormick, Halstead joked about being the driver of a bus that hits Trudeau.</p>

      <p>Agribition CEO Chris Lane said he spoke to Halstead about the joke, and that the performer was apologetic for the incident.</p>
      <p>“Well it’s inappropriate, that’s pretty clear. It’s not reflective of Agribition’s values that’s for certain. I had a conversation with Dennis about it. He has apologized. I think he’s feeling pretty bad about it today, so we did have a conversation about the appropriateness of that,” said Lane.</p>
      <p>“That kind of stuff really doesn’t belong at our rodeo, so he’s making sure that that’s not going to happen again.”</p>
      <p>Lane said Halstead will be performing throughout the rodeo until Saturday.</p>
      <p>Halstead has won several awards for his work as a rodeo clown. He is a seven-time winner of Pro Rodeo Entertainer of The Year and a two-time Canadian Finals rodeo clown/barrelman.</p>
