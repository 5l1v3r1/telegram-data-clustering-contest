      <p>Nate Robinson isn't exactly Mr Popular in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>, and he's about to ruffle a few more feathers with the village residents.</p>
      <p>On Friday (November 29), the farmhand risks another backlash when he drops the bombshell that he plans to STAY in the village.</p>

      <p>Nate (played by Jurell Carter) is keen to stick around in the village after Kim Tate offered him the opportunity to take the lease on Wylie's Farm, which has been lying empty.</p>
      <p>So basically, Cain's illegitimate son isn't going anywhere...</p>
      <p>Although Nate has kept his intentions under wraps, troublemaker Kim forces Nate to tell <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-moira-dingle/">Moira</a> about his plans tonight.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Predictably, it goes down like a bomb...</p>
      <p>Viewers know that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-left-cringing-and-sickened-by-moira-and-nates-gratuitous-sex-scenes/">Moira embarked on a passionate affair with Nate</a> shortly after he arrived in the village.</p>
      <p>After months of illicit meetings behind husband Cain's back, the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-cain-finally-discovers-the-truth-about-nate-and-moira/">truth came out in explosive episodes during the big October week</a>.</p>

      <p>As if the affair wasn't bad enough, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-divided-as-nate-is-revealed-to-be-cain-dingles-son/">Nate unveiled his true identity - he is Cain's son</a>.</p>
      <p>After the big reveal, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-divided-as-cain-dingle-throws-wife-moira-out/">Cain dumped Moira</a> and rejected his son, so it's not surprising that Nate's decision to remain in the village will be an unpopular one.</p>
      <p>Moira is desperate for Nate to leave, believing she stands no chance of rebuilding her family if he's close by.</p>
      <p>But, as the news spreads across the village, not everyone is as negative about Nate's decision - with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-belle-dingle/">Belle</a> keen to play peacemaker.</p>
      <p>However, Cain's reaction is one of anger and a huge argument follows... Will <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-convinced-they-know-who-nates-mum-is-as-cains-revealed-as-his-dad/">Nate ever be accepted by his dad</a>?</p>
