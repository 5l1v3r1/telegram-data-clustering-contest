      <h1>The Asset Allocator: Meb Faber - All-Time Highs Are 'Nothing To Be Afraid Of' (Podcast)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">SA For FAs</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ETF manager, author and popular investment blogger Mebane Faber addresses the asset allocation issues of the day. Among our topics in this wide-ranging interview:</li>
        <li>Faber does not look askance at buy-and-hold, just says it’s hard to do, from a behavioral standpoint. Trend-following has its merits, but isn’t easy to implement either.</li>
        <li>All-time stock-market highs are nothing to fear, from a market-history point of view.</li>
        <li>He names country markets that are “downright cheap,” noting that value works because a lot of people just don’t want to own it.</li>
        <li>Low fees is a strategy that works, and becoming rich is not the same thing as staying rich, which often requires a different strategy.</li>
      </ul>
