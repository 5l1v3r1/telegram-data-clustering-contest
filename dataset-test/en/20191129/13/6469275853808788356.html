        <b>Our staff got into a jumble after we got delivery of some popcorn - but with a difference.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Metcalfe’s Popcorn Jumbles has launched two flavour combos, Toffee Apple and Eton Mess, and we were met with a nice surprise.<br/>Reminiscent of the much-loved traditional treat, the toffee apple pack contained toffee and caramel-coated popcorn jumbled up with slices of dried apple.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, the Eton Mess flavour, was bursting with strawberry pieces and crunchy meringue to go with the strawberry-coated popcorn, replicating the British summer favourite dessert.<br/>How was this going to go down with our tasters, who were ready for a pick-me-up treat after a hard day at the office?<br/>The butterfly popcorn uses real fruit pieces, is gluten-free, suitable for vegetarians, high in fibre and made without artificial flavours and colours.</p>
      <p>Metcalfe’s Popcorn Jumbles Toffee Apple is just 107 kcals per portion and Eton Mess a mere 80 kcals, so nibbling is guilt-free.<br/>Exclusively available now at Sainsbury’s (RRP: £1.79).</p>

        <b>Our verdict</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Testers were certainly given a new experience with their popcorn treat, as we were not expecting to find strawberry pieces, meringue shells or slices of toffee apple in our bags.<br/>Our tasters said the Eton Mess popcorn was quite sweet, but not too overpowering and the meringue was like a crunch pudding. But it was felt there needed to be a few more pieces of strawberry and meringue to give a fuller flavour.<br/>The toffee apple popcorn was described as ‘very appley’ with distinctive flavour. The balance of sweetness was just right and the toffee apple pieces were very noticeable.</b>
