      <p>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi has said he will submit his resignation to parliament in the wake of anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>The move comes just over a year since he took office.</p>
      <p>The statement, broadcast on Iraqi TV, also comes a day after dozens of protesters were killed by security forces and shortly after Iraq’s top Shiite cleric called on the parliament to withdraw support.</p>

      <p>Leading cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani had warned of civil war amid the worsening violence in the capital and Iraq’s southern provinces during his weekly Friday sermon delivered in the holy city of Najaf.</p>
      <p>He also said protesters should distinguish between peaceful demonstrators and those who have malign intentions to co-opt their movement.</p>
      <p>Forty protesters were shot dead by security forces in Baghdad and the southern cities of Najaf and Nasiriya on Thursday, one day after the burning of an Iranian consulate.</p>

      <p>“I will submit to parliament an official memorandum resigning from the current prime ministry so that the parliament can review its choices,” he said.</p>
      <p>He was appointed prime minister just over a year ago as a consensus candidate between political blocs.</p>
      <p>Three more protesters were killed and eight wounded on Friday by security forces, who used live rounds in the southern city of Nasiriyah.</p>
