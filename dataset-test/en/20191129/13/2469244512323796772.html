      <p>TORQUAY United manager Gary Johnson has described new loan signing Amrit Bansal-McNulty as a 'pocket rocket' after the Queen's Park Rangers teenager joined the Gulls on a deal to January 5.</p>
      <p>Bansal-McNulty's arrival is expected to be followed by a second signing ahead of Saturday's key National League home game against Stockport County.</p>
      <p>The Hoops starlet's initial deal covers United's next eight games.</p>
      <p>Johnson said: "Amrit can play anywhere across midfield, including the No.10 role, and he is a good footballer.</p>
      <p>"He is a proper rocket - only small in stature, but he has a big heart, a good brain and he can run all day.Â  QPR have high hopes for him."</p>
      <p>Bansal-McNulty, who hails from Hackney, nearly aimed at an acting career before he was spotted playing on north London's highly competitive 'Futsal' circuit.</p>
      <p>He has made rapid progress at QPR - it takes him nearly an hour-and-a-half's travelling across the capital to get to training each day - and he is now regarded as one of the Hoops' most promising Under-23 players.</p>
