      <h1>Mithun’s good news, bad news day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:24:25+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-Dipak-Ragav-682/" target="_blank">S. Dipak Ragav</a></address>
      <p>Within a span of a few hours, Abhimanyu Mithun found himself in the news for two contrasting reasons.</p>
      <p>On Friday it emerged he has been summoned by the Bengaluru police for questioning in connection with match-fixing allegations in the Karnataka Premier League 2019, that surfaced earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Later in the day, the former India pacer found himself in the record books after picking up five wickets, including a hat-trick, in one over for Karnataka in the semifinals of the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament against Haryana.</p>
      <p>Mithun had earlier picked a hat-trick in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final against Tamil Nadu last month. He now has become the first bowler to have a hat-trick in all three formats in Indian domestic cricket.</p>
      <p>The pacer did not have a great day till his last over, which was also the last over of the innings, having gone for 37 runs from his first three overs and finished with 5/39 in four overs.</p>
      <p>Mithun removed two-set batsmen off the first two balls when Himanshu Rana (61) was caught at mid-wicket before Rahul Tewatia (34) was caught at long-on. His hat-trick victim was Sumit Kumar trying to scoop it over leg-side only to give a simple catch to the short fine-leg fielder.</p>
      <p>Amit Mishra was the next to go, trying to swat it across the off-side and top-edging to the cover fielder inside the ring. Jayant Yadav was dismissed off the last bowl of the innings trying to go behind fine-leg but feathering to wicket-keeper K.L. Rahul.</p>
