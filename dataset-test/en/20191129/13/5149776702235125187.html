      <p>An ambulance chief has urged the public #DontAbuseOurStaff after a rude note was left on a vehicle that was attending an emergency.</p>
      <p>Life-saving paramedics returned to their ambulance to find the insulting note slapped on the windscreen.</p>
      <p>The person criticised staff for parking their vehicle over the householder's drive, according to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/furious-homeowner-leaves-note-parked-20984407">The Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>"Dumbass!" the note, which was covered by plastic to protect it from the elements, exclaimed.</p>
      <p>"You are fully blocking my driveway!"</p>

      <p>South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said the crew were on a 999 call in Lymington, Hampshire, when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>The service posted a photo of the note on its Twitter account above a caption defending its paramedics.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, Zoe &amp; Chris came back to this in in Lymington, Hampshire, today," the post explained.</p>
      <p>"It's not always possible to park without obstructing traffic flow or driveways as parking further away could add minutes to our arrival time that the patient simply doesn't have.</p>
      <p>"#DontAbuseOurStaff."</p>
      <p>Mark Davis, South Central Ambulance Service governor, expressed his disappointment at the note.</p>
      <p>“Disgusting to see, very sad that some people do not appreciate that amazing work our clinicians do every day of the week," he wrote.</p>
      <p>The trust, which serves more than seven million people across an area comprising of Hampshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire has received 800 supportive comments after posting the note.</p>

      <p>Ellen Taylor said: “Unbelievable, just hope that person is never the emergency, they might be more understanding and compassionate.</p>
      <p>“You all do a great job for which most of us are incapable of doing. Thank you for all you do.”</p>
      <p>Dr Sarah Schofield, chair of the West Hampshire Clinical Commissioning group, said: “Ambulance teams and the wider NHS support patients and save lives across Hampshire.</p>
      <p>“No NHS staff should suffer any form of abuse, and it is vital that emergency services can access people’s homes as quickly as possible to treat a medical emergency.</p>
      <p>“We would like to thank ambulance teams for their continuous hard work and dedication, especially as we head into the busiest time of year.”</p>
