      <p>Climate change protesters brought Upper Parliament Street to a standstill during a procession in Nottingham city centre.</p>
      <p>At least 100 people took part in the march through the city with "climate change is a war of the rich against the poor" ringing around the streets.</p>
      <p>The 'March for Climate Justice' was part of an international day of action and organised by Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/environment">YouthStrike4Climate.</a></p>
      <p>They proceeded from the Royal Centre at 12pm today, Friday November 29, marching down Upper Parliament Street and delaying buses.</p>
      <p>The chanting marchers then turned into one of Nottingham's busiest shopping streets, Clumber Street, where hundreds were shopping during <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/shopping/">Black Friday.</a></p>

      <p>Before the procession, protesters had gathered around the Brian Clough statue to give speeches.</p>
      <p>The call for "climate justice" was aimed at large organisations and political parties to take notice of climate change and the impact it is having on the planet "before it's too late".</p>
      <p>Demands were being made to end the use of and investment in burning fossil fuels.</p>

      <p>She said: "I've been involved with climate change protests since February and I'm absolutely terrified at what's going to happen in the future.</p>
      <p>"Today is all about putting pressure on groups to take notice of the impact it is having on our planet.</p>
      <p>"Enough attention is not being paid to the severity of the matter. You only have to look at the issues we had this month with flooding."</p>
      <p>Lee Ghalem, 23, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/the-meadows">The Meadows</a>, a freelance illustrator, added: "The main thing for me is that we have not got enough time to not take things into our own hands and make a difference.</p>

      <p>"The reality is the only reason people stand up and listen is through protests like this.</p>
      <p>"We've got to put the pressure on big groups and create something more sustainable."</p>
      <p>Alex Gibb, 21, of Sneinton, who is currently unemployed, said: "I think it's a great turnout. I love events like this to really show we are serious about our planet and the impact big business is having on it.</p>
      <p>"Our planet is being stolen from under us and it's got to be stopped. With the election coming up, this is a perfect opportunity to make our voices heard to these parties. They have to take notice."</p>

      <p>Some members of the public were not impressed by the march, saying the disruption caused took away from the message protesters were trying to give.</p>
      <p>"It's just annoying people," said Mary Hunter, 61, of West Bridgford. "The fact they are stopping buses is, ironically, adding emissions into the air. I understand the impact of climate change, but there are experts putting these views across.</p>
      <p>"This disruption annoys people and makes people resent what they are trying to do."</p>

      <p>"It's ridiculous and is just causing a load of disruption," added Mike Hick, 54, of Mapperley.</p>
      <p>"Real change is made through debate and policies, not disrupting others."</p>
