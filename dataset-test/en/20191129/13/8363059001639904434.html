      <p>This weekend you can get two for Old Fashioned cocktails to celebrate Thanksgiving,but this sounds an awful lot like a Black Friday deal.</p>
      <p>The American bourbon brand is lauding those of you who always foot the bill for your cheap ass friends at the bar with its 2-for-1 cocktail offer so you can drag those penniless bastards down to your local and demand payback.</p>
      <p>"We’ve all got that friend who owes us a drink or two, so make the most of it this November and grab your free Wild Turkey Old Fashioned at a bar near you!” says Joseph St Clair Ford, Brand Ambassador at Wild Turkey UK. If your mates don't pony up, you can always pick up the tab and then slowly pour out the second free cocktail onto the floor while making unwavering eye contact with them, and ignoring the protests of the irate bar staff.</p>
