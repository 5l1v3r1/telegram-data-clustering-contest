      <p>AMD dominates the charts of best-selling desktop processors<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>AMD confirms the excellent period it is experiencing thanks to its offer of processors for desktop computers. After having conquered 30% of the market, according to Amazon’s sales, in the retailer’s list of best-selling processors, AMD takes 8 out of the top 10 spots.</p>
      <p>After the “fiasco” collected in 2011 with the launch of the Bulldozer microarchitecture and a black period for the company. In the last few years, AMD has literally been reborn. Managing to recover 30% in worldwide processor sales according to data released by CPUBenchmark.</p>

      <p>Although it is reasonable to expect a strong response from Intel, even on the price side, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/AMD">AMD</a> has yet to prove that it can replicate the success of its desktop CPUs on the all-important notebook segment.</p>
      <p>For the moment, confining itself to the desktop, the numbers confirm that AMD is in continuous strong growth. Looking at the data shared by Amazon in this week of Black Friday. We learn that in the United States of the top 10 best-selling desktop processors 8 are AMD brand, 2 Intel.</p>
      <p>The absolute best-selling CPU is the Ryzen 7 2700X followed by Ryzen 5 2600 and Ryzen 5 3600. In fourth place is the Intel Core i5-9600K processor.</p>
      <p>In the UK the top three places in the ranking are occupied by Ryzen 5 3600. Alongside Ryzen 7 3700X and Intel’s Core i7-9700K.</p>
      <p>Also according to monthly statistics published by Mindfactory, sales of Ryzen 3000 processors reached a historical record in September 2019, far exceeding the Intel offer.</p>
