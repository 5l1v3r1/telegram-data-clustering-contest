      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:57:38+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Lamont Mark Smith</a></address>
      <p>After abruptly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/dyson-just-killed-its-ingenious-electric-car-read-the-ceos-email-to-staff-explaining-what-happened/">cancelling its “ingenious”</a> electric car project in Singapore, British technology company Dyson has announced plans to <a href="https://www.mapletree.com.sg/Media/News/2019/November/Mapletree%20Creates%20Another%20Destination%20for%20Global%20Best%20in%20St%20James%20Power%20Station.aspx">move into St James Power Station, one of the nation’s most historic sites.</a></p>
      <p>The 110,000 sq ft. power station will undergo renovation and retrofitting works that are expected to finish by the second half of 2021.</p>
      <p>In a report on Thursday (Nov 28), The Straits Times reported that Dyson was<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/st-james-power-station-will-be-dysons-new-global-hq-in-spore"> planning to double</a> its pool of engineers and scientists here in the next five years. The company currently<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/dyson-seeking-degree-giving-powers-singapore-could-be-first-campus-venue-outside-uk"> hires around 1,100 people in Singapore</a>, The Straits Times said in previous report.</p>
      <p>Jim Rowan, Dyson’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company had outgrown its current Singapore technology centre at Singapore Science Park, and that the “historic St James Power Station will be a most inspiring backdrop for Dyson’s people”.</p>
      <p>“It will be a hive for our research and development endeavours, as we focus on great technology breakthroughs,” he added.</p>
      <p>Built as a power station in the 1920s and then abandoned, the national monument was for a time also one of Singapore’s biggest nightlife hubs.</p>
      <p>These archived photos from The Straits Times and The New Paper show how the site situated near Sentosa has evolved over the past century:</p>

      <h3>According to the National Library Board (NLB), St James Power Station was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1712_2010-10-15.html">Singapore’s first power station</a>, and was built by the British between 1924 and 1927.</h3>
      <h3>Located near the entrance of Sentosa, the coal-fired station started generating electricity on June 1, 1927, and was officially opened by Sir Hugh Clifford.</h3>

      <h3>However, the station was beset with power failures and blackouts.</h3>
      <h3>In 1950, Singapore suffered its most extensive blackout when electricity to the entire island was cut off for 1.5 hours, NLB said.</h3>
      <h3>Then in 1956, the station underwent renovations as it was deemed to be running inefficiently.</h3>

      <h3>The site was reopened in 1960 by Goh Keng Swee, who was Finance Minister at the time.</h3>
      <h3>The upgraded power station was equipped with new machines and generators that increased power output to 40,000 kilowatts.</h3>
      <h3>However, it was unable to meet the Republic’s rising demand for electricity, and was decomissioned in 1976.</h3>

      <h3>In the 1980s, the building was converted into a warehouse by the Port of Singapore Authority until 1992.</h3>
      <h3>After which, it remained largely vacant.</h3>

      <h3>In 2006, St James Power Station was given a new lease of life as a nightlife complex, thanks to Mapletree, EK Holdings, FJ Benjamin, and local entrepreneur and nightlife veteran Dennis Foo.</h3>
      <h3>According to NLB, the transformation cost about S$40 million, half of which was invested by Mapletree primarily on conservation, and the other S$20 million from the rest of the investors on interiors and furnishings.</h3>

      <h3>The revamped St James Power Station was used for all sorts of electrifying acts, and saw concerts by Taiwanese boyband Fahrenheit, K-pop star Jay Park and local singer JJ Lin.</h3>

      <h3>In 2009, the National Heritage Board (NHB) gazetted the building as a national monument, which meant that owners of the building are not allowed to alter the facade, build any extensions, or hack any walls.</h3>

      <h3>However, a series of crimes saw the complex’s reputation decline.</h3>
      <h3>In 2016, five men were charged for <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/fifth-suspect-charged-over-molotov-cocktail-attack-on-club-at-st-james-power">hurling Molotov cocktails</a> at a club in St James, in a bid to set it ablaze, ST reported.</h3>
      <h3>In March 2017, a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/fourth-man-charged-with-st-james-power-station-murder">34-year-old man died</a> after being stabbed there.</h3>

      <h3>Subsequently, St James Power Station was shut down once again in 2018, after 12 years as one of Singapore’s biggest nightlife complexes.</h3>
      <h3>According to ST, the premises were returned to Mapletree and restoration works began.</h3>

      <h3>The complex is now set to become Dyson’s new global headquarters.</h3>
      <h3>Mapletree said that the restored monument will house a Heritage Gallery in one of its chimneys to showcase its contribution to the country as a power station.</h3>
      <h3>There will also be a heritage trail around the monument featuring maritime artefacts, and will be further developed in collaboration with Dyson.</h3>
