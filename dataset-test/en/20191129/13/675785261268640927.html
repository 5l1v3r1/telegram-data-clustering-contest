      <p>A man with a horror skull tattooed on his face is being hunted by police after he dragged a teenage girl into some bushes near a bus stop and raped her.</p>
      <p>The attacker, who police say had an Eastern European accent, pounced as the girl got off the number 11a bus in East Hunsbury, Northampton, at 5pm on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Officers say he dragged her into a nearby wooded area where he subjected her to a serious sexual assault before she was able to fight her way free.</p>
      <p>Detectives are trying to reassure women in the area and say every effort is being made to catch him before he strikes again.</p>
