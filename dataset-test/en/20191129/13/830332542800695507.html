      <p>NEW HAMPTON, Iowa - The sentencing of a Wisconsin man found guilty of manslaughter in Iowa has been delayed a week.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Dalton Adam, of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, was convicted Nov. 4 of voluntary manslaughter. He'd been charged with first-degree murder, but the jury convicted him of the lesser crime.</p>
      <p>Winneshiek County court records say Adam's sentencing was set for Tuesday but has been rescheduled for Tuesday next week.</p>
      <p>He and his friend Jacob Seelinger were charged after the July 2018 attack on 46-year-old David Hansen outside Hansen's home in Decorah. Seelinger's been convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to up to 50 years in prison.</p>
