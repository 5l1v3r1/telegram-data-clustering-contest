      <p>On Thursday, BBC meteorologist Tomasz Schafernaker was in the middle of a report predicting snow in the forecast for parts of the U.S. Midwest when he got interrupted by Siri.</p>
      <p>The voice coming through on his Apple Watch read its own weather report, contradicting him by saying there was no snow expected.</p>

      <p>Schafernaker responded, laughing, “Yeah but it probably doesn’t know what place I’m talking about.”</p>
