      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with an ankle ligament injury suffered against Napoli on Wednesday night, with the Brazilian missing the whole of December.</p>
      <p>The Reds face a busy month with 10 games across four competitions, and will be without one of their most important players throughout, which is a major blow after <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>‘s early form.</p>
      <p>Only <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> have played more minutes than the No. 3 this campaign, but Klopp is now left to plan without him.</p>
      <p>Speaking in his pre-Brighton press conference at Melwood on Friday, the manager stressed that work is already underway to find his replacement in the squad.</p>
      <p>“Of yes, of course that’s absolutely bad news. Nothing good to say about that,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>“So about the timeframe, or how long it will take, we are not sure 100 percent.</p>

      <p>“But it looks pretty sure he will not be involved in the Christmas fixtures, let me say it is like this.</p>
      <p>“Obviously it takes a while. The whole night after the game, [the injury] was my main problem.</p>
      <p>“But meanwhile we’ve known it for two days, we have solutions for that, for the position.</p>
      <p>“We have to replace him, we can replace him, we played good without him, that’s all OK.</p>
      <p>“For now it’s important that he gets doing the right things and then will be back as soon as possible, and until then, yes we have to find solutions.</p>
      <p>“We are not the only team with injured players, so that’s what we have to deal with now, and we will.”</p>

      <p>Klopp confirmed that there were no other new injury concerns after the draw with Napoli, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a> back from illness and training with the squad on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Guinean could come into contention following <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>‘s injury, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/adam-lallana/">Adam Lallana</a> the most likely candidates to take over as deep-lying midfielder.</p>
      <p>Continuing his assessment of the situation, Klopp acknowledged the setback, but suggested Liverpool could even “change system” to accommodate <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>‘s absence.</p>
      <p>“In the preparation for the Napoli game, for example, we watched the Napoli game from last year a little bit, not too much but a little bit, but Hendo played the position,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Gini played the position already, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/adam-lallana/">Adam Lallana</a> played the position, we can change system, we can do different things.</p>

      <p>“So like I said, losing a player with the quality of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> is big, massive really, but we are not the only team in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> with injuries. That’s how it is.</p>
      <p>“You want to push that moment as far as possible to the end of the year, because in this period if you have two weeks out you miss six games.</p>
      <p>“That’s now the case, we cannot change it anymore. We have to find a solution, and we will find a solution.</p>
      <p>“Will it be exactly like <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>? Of course not, because nobody is like the other one, but it will be a good one.</p>
      <p>“Then we have to play football and win football games again, that’s it.”</p>
