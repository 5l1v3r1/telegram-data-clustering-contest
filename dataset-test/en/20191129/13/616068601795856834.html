      <p>RCMP are requesting the public's help in locating a missing Kelowna resident. </p>
      <p>William Byron Williams was last seen leaving his residence Nov. 24, and has since failed to return.</p>
      <p>Williams also goes by the name “Bill” and “Bear.”</p>
      <p>He is described as a Caucasian male, 63 years old, six feet two inches tall, 300 pounds, with grey hair, a full beard, and brown eyes. He wears glasses, and frequently uses a cane or walker.</p>
      <p>"Police are concerned for William’s well-being," says Const. Solana Paré. "His friends report that it is out of character for him to be out of contact for this long."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is urged to contact their local police, or CrimeStoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).</p>
