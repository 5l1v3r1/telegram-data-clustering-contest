      <p>President Donald Trump mocked Newsweek after they reported Thursday he spent Thanksgiving golfing and tweeting. In fact, the president was secretly traveling to Afghanistan to visit deployed American troops.</p>
      <p>“I thought Newsweek was out of business?” Trump wrote on Twitter, sharing a screenshot of the article and photos of him with the troops in Afghanistan posted by his son Donald Trump Jr.</p>

      <p>“Fake news gonna fake!” Trump Jr. wrote.</p>
      <p>The Newsweek story, first published at 10:16 a.m., was later updated to reflect the president’s visit.</p>
      <p>“This story has been substantially updated and edited at 6:17 pm EST to reflect the president’s surprise trip to Afghanistan,” read an editors note after Trump Jr. mocked the news outlet.</p>
      <p><i>The Washington Post</i> sold Newsweek in 2010 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/its-official-newsweek-will-be-sold-to-former-stereo-equipment-mogul-sidney-harman-who-reportedly-bid-1-in-excha-2010-8">for a dollar </a>and changed hands several times before ending its print magazine in 2012. In 2018, Newsweek <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/newsweek-splits-ibt-media-standalone-company">split</a> from IBT Media into a standalone company.</p>
      <p>A similar situation happened when President Trump visited the troops in Iraq during Christmas in 2018. NBC News <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nbc-news-insists-corrected-story-about-trump-not-visiting-troops-was-correct-at-the-time">reported</a> Trump was the first president since 2002 not to visit the troops at Christmastime, while he was secretly traveling to Iraq, prompting widespread ridicule from Trump staff and his supporters.</p>
