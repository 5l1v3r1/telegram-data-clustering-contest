      <p>While it is common for people to walk around looking for dustbins to dispose-off trash, mobile waste bins will now be seen moving along designated tracks to detect and collect garbage. Students of the Bhartiya Skill Development University (BSDU) here have invented a ‘smart trash collector’ to eliminate the need to search for dustbins at public places.</p>
      <p>“It is a track-following dustbin which follows a particular track to collect waste,” said Mayank, a student from the department of computer skills.”</p>
      <p>He added, “It moves from one point to another following the track sensors. It also has a motion detector and detects the presence of people, opens up automatically to collect trash from them and then moves on to other people after collecting the trash.”</p>
      <p>This prototype of the ‘smart dustbin’ has been developed by students of the first semester who are now working towards adding a more features like a built-in camera, a mechanical hand/holder, and additional sensors.</p>
      <p>The students said that they have invented the automatic dustbin in view of smart cities being developed in the country, with Jaipur being one of them.</p>
      <p>“The smart trash collector can be used at places like hospitals, schools and public places,” the University’s principal Dr Anurag said.</p>
