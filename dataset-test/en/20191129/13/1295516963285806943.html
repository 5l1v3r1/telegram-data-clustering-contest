      <h1>The Flash's Iris Reveals BTS Footage of That Disgusting Dinner Scene</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:11:57+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Meagan Damore</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-tv/"><i>The Flash</i></a> star Candice Patton, who plays Iris West-Allen, shared some behind-the-scenes footage of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/candice-patton-flash-most-disgusting-scene-photo/">what she once described</a> as "one of the most disgusting scenes" in the series.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, the scene she referred to back in September was actually a dream sequence. In "The Last Temptation of Barry Allen, Part 1," Barry was infected by Bloodwork when he tried to save Ralph Dibny from the same fate. This allowed Dr. Ramsey Rosso to get in his head. In an attempt to get Barry to submit, Ramsey showed him a variety of visions, including a dinner sequence with Team Flash. All of Barry's friends and family invited him to partake as black goo oozed out of their mouths.</p>

      <p>In the video, which Patton shared on Twitter, she declared she is "about to get gooed!" She showed herself and several other cast members getting black goo applied to their teeth and lips. At one point, she is told to swish the substance around her mouth, and her look at the camera suggests it doesn't taste all that great. "I don't get paid enough for this shit," she said.</p>

      <p>"How are we going to do something like this?" she mused through peals of laughter. "I'm always crying! I'm very sad! My boyfriend is dying!"</p>
      <p>According to the synopsis of "The Last Temptation of Barry Allen, Part 2," the midseason finale,</p>
