      <p>CounterAttack road checks return this weekend to encourage drivers to make smart and safe decisions during the holiday season.</p>
      <p>Police across the province will be setting up road checks to keep impaired drivers off the roads.</p>
      <p>“CounterAttack remains a vital, strategic enforcement measure. Most people have got the message that driving after drinking or consuming drugs is dangerous,” Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth said in a press release.</p>
      <p>“However, there are still those willing to take a chance with the lives of themselves, their passengers and road users. CounterAttack makes intercepting those people job No. 1.”</p>
      <p>Going out celebrating? Call a cab, designate a sober driver, or use a driving service to get home safely.</p>
