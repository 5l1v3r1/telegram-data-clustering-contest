      <p>It’s important that this salad is really crunchy. Prepare it near to the time you want to serve it, so that it doesn’t get soft. If you can find little purple micro-leaves then add them to this salad – they look really good</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>20 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>eight</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the dressing</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>90g smooth peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>½ red chilli, deseeded and very finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove, grated to a purée</li>
        <li>1½cm square piece of ginger root, peeled and grated to a purée</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the salad</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>200g carrots, preferably of different colours, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>100g mooli, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>100g radishes, trimmed and cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>160g white cabbage (dense core removed), shredded</li>
        <li>160g red cabbage (dense core removed), shredded</li>
        <li>10g coriander leaves</li>
        <li>3 spring onions, finely sliced on the diagonal</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put everything for the dressing in a food processor or blender with 2 tbsp hot water and blitz, or mix everything together with a fork, beating vigorously. You should have quite a smooth mixture. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>Once cut into matchsticks, put the carrots, mooli and radishes into a bowl of iced water. This really crisps the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Before serving, drain them and dry in a clean tea towel. Toss them in a bowl with the cabbage, coriander and most of the spring onions. Either drizzle the dressing over the top before scattering with the rest of the spring onions, or serve the dressing on the side and let people help themselves.</li>
