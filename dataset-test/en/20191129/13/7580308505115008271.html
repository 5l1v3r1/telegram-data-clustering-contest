      <p><a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/fireboy-dml/">Fireboy DML</a> has released the video to “Scatter”, a track off his recently released debut album <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/fireboy-dml-releases-new-album-laughter-tears-goosebumps/">“Laughter, Tears &amp; Goosebumps”</a>.</p>
      <p>The first half of the Clearance Peters shot and directed video is set in futuristic, post-apocalyptic Lagos. Fireboy steps into a warehouse and soon begins to count down on his holographic device. In no time, this activates the people nearby, who suddenly begin to work themselves into a frenzy of dance.</p>
      <p>The second half of the video, tagged Universe 2 sees Fireboy dressed as the Joker, Batman’s arch-rival. He is later seen dancing with a number of crazed clown face dancers.</p>
