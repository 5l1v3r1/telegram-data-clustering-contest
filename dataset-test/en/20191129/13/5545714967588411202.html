      <p>If you fancy making Black Friday darker than ever, then publisher Clickteam has got the release for you. Today sees the infamous <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> franchise finally creep its way onto console platforms.<br/><br/>The <i>Five Nights</i> series, created and developed by programmer Scott Cawthorn, has built a huge following since its inception with its tense gameplay, grim atmosphere and notorious jumpscares. The initial premise of the series sees the player in the role of a hapless security guard, who must survive the night shift in a beat-up children's restaurant, populated by homicidal animatronic characters.<br/><br/>The first four mainline entries - <i>Five Nights at Freddy's, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, Five Nights at Freddy's 3</i>, and <i>Five Nights at Freddy's 4</i> - are all available to download on PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch today. Not joining the party is the fifth mainline game <i>Sister Location</i> or any of the<i> FNAF</i> spin-off titles. Each entry is priced around $8.</p>
