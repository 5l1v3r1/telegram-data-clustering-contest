      <h2>Julie Camlin, from Huddersfield, spends hundreds as a season ticket holder at the St George's Square car park which has cut a number of its car parking spaces in recent months</h2>

      <p>A woman has revealed how getting up at the crack of dawn still won't guarantee her a car parking place for her busy morning commumte.</p>
      <p>Julie Camlin, from Huddersfield, has vented her frustration after finding all the spaces were gone despite her arriving at 6.40am when it was still dark.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, Julie is season ticket holder at the official car park off St George's Square next to the city's main train station.</p>
      <p>Mrs Camlin said the number of long stay spaces has recently been slashed meaning the hundreds of pounds she spent on her season pass did not guarantee her a spot.</p>
      <p>She said she had used one of "ten empty staff spaces" to avoid missing her train.</p>
      <p>"This situation is wholly unacceptable," she told <a href="https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/">ExaminerLive</a> .</p>

      <p>"I have had no notice of this reduction in parking spaces or an option to get a refund of my pass so I can park elsewhere.</p>
      <p>"I understand there may be overflow parking but station staff were unable to tell me where this is.</p>
      <p>"If the situation continues I will have no option but to park on the wasteland around the corner, something I have avoided due to concerns with my personal safety when arriving so early and returning in the dark.</p>
      <p>"The short stay spaces are always empty which adds to the frustration as an early commuter.</p>
      <p>"It's such a disappointment but yet another sign of Huddersfield not supporting its people and offering terrible service to the loyal users of a failing network."</p>
      <p>She continued: "As a season ticket holder of both the train and the car park I spend nearly Â£300 per month travelling to and from Huddersfield station.</p>

      <p>"If the constant lack of drivers and delayed trains was not enough the appalling car park facilities are a joke."The spaces are not wide enough for any vehicle and the number of spaces available is not at all sufficient for the size of the station.</p>
      <p>"The recent reduction in parking spaces has come without any communication other than one flyer placed on my car in the pouring rain making it impossible to read.</p>
      <p>"As a result I have no idea where the overflow spaces are or how long this will continue for."This lack of respect or consideration for customers is appalling, how you can charge a high amount for such terrible facilities and then further degrade them with so little communication is unacceptable."</p>
      <p>The car park behind the abandoned George Hotel is run by APCOA.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said the reduction in spaces was due to construction work by Network Rail and TransPennine Express (TPE), who operate the station, to improve the platforms.</p>
      <p>TransPennine Express has been approached for comment.</p>
