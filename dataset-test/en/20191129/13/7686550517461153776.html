      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:57:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Wright, Amardeep Bassey</a></address>
      <p>A baby boy has been dubbed Mowgli after the Disney Jungle Book character - thanks to his 5cm of thick jet-black hair.</p>
      <p>Oscar’s locks were spotted on a scan before he entered the world, with doctors estimating it was already 1cm long inside the womb.</p>
      <p>After he was just eight weeks old, parents Sara Morris, 36, and Joshua Jones, 29, had to take him for his first haircut as his mop continued to grow.</p>
      <p>When the couple are out walking with Oscar, admirers often stop them in the street to comment on his locks.</p>
      <p>Now, 20 weeks have passed since she had her C-section, and Sara says they’ve dubbed him ‘Mowgli’ after <i>The Jungle Book</i> character due to his unique hairstyle.</p>
      <p>The happy couple were blown away when 7lb 8oz Oscar was born with an astonishing 5cm of thick jet black hair, reports <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/devon-baby-boy-born-full-3580999">DevonLive</a> .</p>

      <p>Sara, who runs a baby shop in the village, said "people on the street come over to us and comment on Oscar's lovely thick hair".</p>
      <p>Sara said: "We really couldn't believe just how much hair he had when he was born! It's not something you see very often!</p>
      <p>"His hair was, and is, very thick and very black. Joshua and I have brown hair, though he's closer to his dad than to me for that.</p>
      <p>"Oscar's aware that he has so much hair, I think. When we lie him down, he'll put his arms over his head and play with it.</p>
      <p>"But he'll start crying when he accidentally pulls it, because his fingers get tangled up!</p>

      <p>"Joshua and I had watched The Jungle Book in December, so maybe the film was fresh on my mind when Oscar was born.</p>
      <p>"I struggled with pregnancy diabetes, and there was a whole week in May where I suffered with this intense heartburn.</p>
      <p>"We went for a regular check-up, and learned that Oscar had 1cm of hair already.</p>
      <p>"So we were expecting him to have some head hair when he was born. But we didn't expect quite as much as we we got!</p>
      <p>"I took one look at him and said - 'he looks just like Mowgli!'.</p>
      <p>"Everyone else then looked and said - 'yeah, you're right! He's Mowgli!'.</p>
      <p>"Joshua's parents have taken to calling him little Mowgli ever since. It started because of his hair, but he's also very cheeky, so I think it will stick!"</p>

      <p>Oscar was born at 2am on July 10 and now has a whopping 12cm of hair on his head.</p>
      <p>Her friends have told Sara Oscar should model - because his striking mane makes him look "more like a little man than a baby".</p>
      <p>Taking to Facebook, Sara's pictures of newborn Oscar were inundated with praise from friends - many astounded by his hair.</p>
      <p>One user posted: "Beautiful. Holy Hair! How is that even possible?!!! ❤ dude will be shaving before you know it!!! ❤".</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Looks adorable. So much hair. So dark. Congratulations ❤ ".</p>
      <p>One said: "Look at all his hair, does he want to share some with me.".</p>
      <p>Another user posted: "Can’t get over his hair ".</p>
      <p>And one friend even suggested: "He is absolutely gorgeous - the hair is amazing! You must both be so proud! He needs to be a model!</p>
      <p>Oscar is yet to see the classic movie although Disney fan Joshua, a warehouse assistant, plans to sit down and watch it with him in the near future.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Oscar likes to dress up as Mr Potato Head from the Toy Story film series, and goes everywhere with a Lion King Simba doll.</p>
      <p>Sara even dressed him up as Harry Potter, and posted a photo online, where one person commented: "I cannot wait to meet this little wizard, everyone loves him ...must be that special magic he has. Bless him xx".</p>
      <p>Another mum said: "Gorgeous bubba. Xxx ".</p>
      <p>Sara described Oscar as "very perceptive, bright, and aware" adding: "Joshua and I can't tell if he'll crawl or talk first!"</p>
      <p>"Oscar looks so much older than other babies - it's his hair!"</p>
