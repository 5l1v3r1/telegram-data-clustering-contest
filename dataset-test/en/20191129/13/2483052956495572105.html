      <p>EDMONTON -- Edmonton's "Robin Hood of McNuggets" has caught the attention of Hollywood actor Tom Hanks.</p>
      <p>Hanks appeared in a video on Twitter reading "Nice Tweets." He included Cody Bondarchuk's confession tweet about adding an extra Chicken McNugget to almost every 10-piece order he made.</p>

      <p>"That is a man who is not only being nice, but he's feeding the world a little bit better," Hanks said. "Bravo! That's a nice thing to do."</p>
      <p>Bondarchuk reacted to the video, calling it "the greatest moment of my life."</p>

      <p>Bondarchuk's original tweet sent Nov. 15 went viral, being retweeted thousands of times and generating attention from around the globe. Many lauded him, saying the small act of adding an extra McNugget was "heroic."</p>
      <p>Bondarchuk has said he hopes to turn his viral moment of fame into a successful run for Edmonton City Council in the next election.</p>
      <p>"Certainly I don't want a platform just based on nuggets," he told CTV News Edmonton at the time. "But anything that gets my name out there, I'm very happy about, because a lot of those things rooted in working-class support is where the platform will go."</p>
      <p>Hanks stars as Mr. Rogers in the new movie <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.</i><i>Â </i></p>
