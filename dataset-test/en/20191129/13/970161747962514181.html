      <p>A boy left terribly burned after his mother’s weed lab was engulfed by a butane explosion now faces losing his voice forever.</p>
      <p>Brian Adams, 16, was given just a five per cent chance of survival after his mother Amanda Skardoutos’ reckless drug manufacturing sparked an explosion whose flames engulfed his body.</p>
      <p>She was jailed for at least six years in the wake of the 2017 accident, which was sparked by her use of butane to process hash oil.</p>
      <p>Brian, from Detroit, subsequently underwent vital tracheotomy surgery to help him breathe.</p>
      <p>But surgeons subsequently warned Brian’s dad and carer Robert that scar tissue could form at any time, costing the youngster his ability to speak forever.</p>

      <p>Robert has since found an expert who could save Brian’s voice, but the procedure will cost $170,000, and the family’s insurers are refusing to pay.</p>

      <p>The dedicated dad told <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/metro-detroit-teen-asks-for-help-getting-surgery-that-will-preserve-his-ability-to-speak">WXYZ</a>: ‘The only priority I am focused on is my son’s airway.</p>
      <p>‘Right now my roof is leaking. My kitchen ceiling collapsed.</p>
      <p>‘All this crazy stuff is going on. None of that even matters.’</p>
      <p>‘He fought so hard and I owe him this procedure.</p>

      <p>‘The kid has had a rough life.’</p>
      <p>Brian’s 11 year-old brother Damien, who was less seriously injured in the blast, is also desperate for his brother to have the surgery so they can maintain their close bond.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘It is important. I like playing with him.</p>
      <p>‘I like playing games. He is my brother and I want to hear him talk.’</p>
      <p>But the future is starting to look brighter for Brian, with a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/d5jffn-i-need-everyones-help?sharetype=teams&amp;member=1953348&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;pc_code=fb_co_postupdate_a&amp;rcid=4dd21489cc424fb4ae19b9dedea69106&amp;fbclid=IwAR1MOZnPFjd3aL0Qbdf4Kek8ZSXYaWmQSav8OLUrzOF2pRQKADqUcdxIdKE">fundraiser</a> set up to fund the surgery rocketing to $134,000 by Friday morning.</p>
