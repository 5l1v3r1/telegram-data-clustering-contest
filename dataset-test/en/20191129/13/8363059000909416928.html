      <h1>The Garmin Forerunner Running Smartwatch is 50% off for Black Friday</h1>

      <p>Lots of people wait to see the Black Friday deals before making a big purchase, especially for techy stuff like smartwatches. If you've been hankering after a GPS watch to go running with (or you want to buy one for someone for Christmas), Amazon's Black Friday deal on the Garmin Forerunner 735XT is exactly what you need.</p>
      <p>With an RRP of £300, the 735XT is half price at £149.99. It's also genuinely a good deal – the same watch <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/04/amazons-spring-sale-is-here-and-here-are-some-of-our-favourite-tech-deals/">was in Amazon's Spring Sale this year</a> for £50 more.</p>
      <p>The smartwatch tracks your heart rate during the day and when you're asleep at night, and gives running information including your stride length and ground contact time. It's water resistant up to 50m and can handle cycling and swimming as well as running workouts.</p>
      <p>You can also receive texts, emails, calls and social media notifications on the 735XT, making it a good all-round smartwatch for athletic types.</p>
      <p>However, it's not such a great choice for hitmen, as one Forerunner owner found out when the watch's <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/01/this-uk-hitmans-smartwatch-helped-convict-him-of-two-murders/">GPS data helped to convict him of two murders</a>.</p>
      <p>Amazon's Black Friday deal on this watch ends at midnight tonight (the 29th), so <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01DWIY39A">get running if you want one</a>.</p>
