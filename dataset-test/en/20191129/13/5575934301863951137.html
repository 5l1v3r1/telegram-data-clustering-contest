      <p>Passengers travelling on a KLM flight on Thursday were forced to endure an 11-hour journey that ended with them being dropped them off exactly where they started because of an erupting volcano.</p>
      <p>Flight KL 685 took off from Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport and had made it all the way to eastern Canada when the crew realised that a volcanic erruption in Mexico, the plane’s destination, meant that the flight wouldn’t be able to land.</p>
      <p>The flight then turned right back around and headed back to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, landing at 2.30 a.m. – 11 hours later.</p>
      <p>The Dutch airline <a href="https://simpleflying.com/klm-11-hour-flight-nowhere/">told aviation news website Simple Flying</a> that “Landing at another airport was not possible, because of the visa requirements of passengers and as there was a large cargo of horses on board.”</p>

      <p>The flight was over New Brunswick in Canada – around 5.5 hours into the flight – when the crew turned around, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/klm-flight-canada-volcano-eruption-mexico-city-horses-a9225661.html">The Independent reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said that the flight, which was operated on a Boeing 747, returned because of a “volcanic eruption in Mexico.”</p>
      <p>They said when the plane returned to Amsterdam, “passengers disembarked normally and have been taken care of in Amsterdam.”</p>
      <p>“They will be rebooked on an alternative flight,” KLM said.</p>
      <p>Planes look to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-planes-do-not-fly-during-volcanic-eruption-2017-11">avoid flying through any volcanic ash</a> because it can cause poor visibility for pilots, and can ruin planes’ engines, putting the plane and those on board in danger. Planes’ <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-planes-do-not-fly-during-volcanic-eruption-2017-11">engines have failed mid-flight because of the ash</a>.</p>
      <p>A 2010 volcanic erruption in Iceland forced airlines in many European countries to ground their flights for a week – the <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/volcanoes-climate-change-and-christianity/">largest shut down of air traffic since WWII</a>.</p>
      <p>More than than <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8633892.stm">95,000 flights were then cancelled</a> and tens of thousands of people were trapped abroad.</p>
