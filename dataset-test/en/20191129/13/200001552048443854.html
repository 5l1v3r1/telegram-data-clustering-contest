      <h1>Gazzetta dello Sport reports Arsenal contact with manager – He’s turned them down, as he did with Tottenham</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T13:16:38+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>As soon as Unai Emery was sacked by Arsenal on Friday morning, the claims about who would replacement, at least in the long term, were immediate.</p>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo was once again pushed forward for the position, as well as Massimiliano Allegri and Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Premier-League/29-11-2019/arsenal-licenziato-emery-ljungberg-allenatore-ad-interim-3501480816403.shtml">Gazzetta dello Sport</a> now report Arsenal have made contact with Allegri, with the suggestion being the contact was made before the Spaniard was fired.</p>
      <p>However, the Italian newspaper claim the former Juventus manager rejected the Gunners approach, just like they say he did when Tottenham Hotspur came calling.</p>
      <p>The reasoning is that Allegri wants to wait until the summer before taking on a new club and wouldn’t want to be parachuted in as a rescue act. Enjoying his sabbatical year, the Italian has no desire to see that interrupted.</p>
      <p>Gazzetta’s claims are difficult to fully buy into. Tottenham appeared to have identified Jose Mourinho as their new man ahead of pushing Mauricio Pochettino out of the Spurs door.</p>
      <p>Allegri doesn’t seem quite as an attractive option for the route Tottenham want to go down. And if one claim is to be believed then, with it coming from the same source, so is the other.</p>
      <p>This sounds more like Allegri PR.</p>
