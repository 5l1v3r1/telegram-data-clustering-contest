      <p>A girl whose mother gave her up because she had Down’s syndrome has been adopted by a single dad after 20 families rejected her.</p>
      <p>Luca Trapanese, 41, from Naples, said his daughter Alba brought immediate ‘joy’ to his life when he adopted her at 13 days old.</p>
      <p>The Italian national was desperate to become a dad but was aware that social services in his country don’t usually grant custody to single gay men.</p>
      <p>He claims they told him that he would only be able to adopt a child with special needs or behavioural issues because of his homosexuality.</p>
      <p>But this did not deter Luca, who has volunteered and worked with people with disabilities since his teens.</p>

      <p>He told Bored Panda: ‘Since I was 14 years old, I have volunteered and worked with the disabled so I felt I had the right knowledge and experience to do it.</p>

      <p>‘She brought me happiness and a sense of fulfillment. I am proud to be her dad. I wanted her to be my daughter.’</p>
      <p>Luca spent his teens visiting his best friend Diego in hospital, helping him with his homework as he battled terminal cancer.</p>
      <p>He says this inspired him to dedicate his life to helping others.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Diego’s death left me with a profound awareness of what living with an illness meant, that’s why I started volunteering with a church in Naples to help critically ill people and kids with disabilities’.</p>
      <p>After his friend passed away, Luca and his then partner founded a charity to help people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The pair were together for 11 years and spoke of adopting, but the relationship broke down before they could become dads.</p>

      <p>Luca  said: ‘Unfortunately a few years ago we broke up. I moved into a house by myself and it was really challenging because I still wanted to become a father, but at the time in Italy it wasn’t possible for a single parent to adopt.</p>
      <p>‘Then things changed and at the beginning of 2017 I was able to apply for adoption, I was told I would only be given a child with problems.’</p>
      <p>He wrote on his application form that he was happy to adopt a child regardless of their health conditions and was paired with Alba in July.</p>

      <p>The 41-year-old, who has published a book on his life with Alba, revealed she has a strong personality and loves being around people.</p>
      <p>He has been hailed as an ‘inspiration to man kind’ for the unconditional love he has for his daughter.</p>
