      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AstonVilla">Aston Villa</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> has signed a new four-year contract at the club, keeping him at the club until 2023.</p>
      <p>Smith joined Villa in October 2018 and successfully guided the club back into the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> in his first season in charge.</p>
      <p> “I’m really happy to have committed my long term future to the Club,” Smith said. “I’m looking forward to all the challenges that come with re-establishing Aston Villa as a top Premier League club.”</p>
      <p>Born in West Bromwich, Smith’s association with Villa was initially forged in his childhood as a supporter of the club.</p>
      <p>He earned the manager’s job at Villa Park on the back of an impressive stint at Brentford, and led his side to victory in May’s Play-Off Final against Derby County.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/christian-purslow">Christian Purslow</a>, CEO of Aston Villa, added: “The Board is delighted that Dean has signed a new four-year contract which puts him at the heart of the Club’s long term rebuilding plans.”</p>
      <p>Aston Villa visit <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a> on Sunday afternoon. A win would take them level on points with their opponents.</p>
