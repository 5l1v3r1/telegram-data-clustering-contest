      <p>Pep Guardiola has backed Newcastle United to survive in the Premier League again this season - and he feels that Manchester City's visit to St James' Park will be just as tough as last term under Rafa Benitez.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona legend watched on last term as City were beaten 2-1 on Tyneside in one of the biggest shocks of the top-flight season.</p>
      <p>Now he is expecting another difficult test as the prepared to take on Steve Bruce's side.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Guardiola</a> said at his Press conference to preview the game: "It's tough with a new manager but they have good results.</p>
      <p>"I think they will stay in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"They are physically strong, fast up front.</p>
      <p>"Their structure is quite similar to under <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Rafa Benitez."</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United</a> slipped 1-0 behind against City last term before goals from Salomon Rondon and Matt Ritchie clinched a big win.</p>
      <p>Guardiola reflected: "We forgot to play (last season).</p>
      <p>"We scored a goal and forgot to attack. We learned from that, obviously, but we had a bad, bad day.</p>
      <p>"Everybody understood that and we make a step forward."</p>
      <p>City still went on to win the title last season despite the defeat against Benitez's side.</p>
      <p>He said: "After that, we tried to be who we are.</p>
      <p>"At that moment, I wasn't thinking about winning the Premier League or winning 14 games in a row.</p>
      <p>"That would be a big mistake."</p>
