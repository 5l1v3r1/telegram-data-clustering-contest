      <p>TV duo <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> have revealed who they think will leave <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> first.</p>
      <p>The first campmate will be voted off tonight (November 29) and the stars will be fighting for immunity in tonight's Reckoning trials.</p>
      <p>During Thursday night's episode of spin-off programme Extra Camp, Ant and Dec said they think former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actor Cliff Parisi is at risk of being voted off.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When asked who they think could potentially leave the jungle first, Ant said: "I think it is fair to say that Cliff is probably in danger because he's not doing a lot."</p>
      <p>Dec added: "I think he is struggling a bit with his energy levels and he's not been in the show a huge amount."</p>

      <p>Six of this year's 12 campmates are currently 'cursed' after losing their Reckoning trials, meaning they also have been living off rice and beans.</p>
      <p>At the end of last night's show, Ant told the campmates: "Currently, six of you are cursed. But that could be about to change with another day of reckonings.</p>
      <p>"Yesterday was just about food, but today is also about immunity from the first public vote off."</p>

      <p>Dec added: "For those who are already cursed, there will be a chance to free yourselves.</p>
      <p>"For those you are currently free, you'll be fighting to stay that way."</p>
      <p>Tonight, the campmates will take on another Reckoning trial to try and win food and immunity.</p>
      <p>Andrew Maxwell, Nadine Coyle, Adele Roberts, Roman Kemp, Myles Stephenson and Andy Whyment are currently free from the curse.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cliff, Kate Garraway, James Haskell, Ian Wright, Caitlyn Jenner and Jacqueline Jossa are not.</p>

      <p>Bookies have already predicted which famous face could leave the jungle first.</p>
      <p>According to Ladbrokes, Andrew and Adele are most likely to be voted off with odds at 6/4 and 7/4 respectively.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Jessica O'Reilly told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10447944/im-a-celebrity-elimination-twist-tonight/">The Sun</a>: "Andrew's failed to really create a decent rapport with his camp mates, let alone the public, and the odds suggest he'll be the first celebrity to be voted out of the jungle."</p>
