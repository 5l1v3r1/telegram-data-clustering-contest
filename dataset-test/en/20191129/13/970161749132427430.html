      <p>A horse has died after it became impaled on a fence when it ran in terror from two fireworks that were set off in its field.</p>
      <p>Owner Laura Roberts, 28, has been left devastated by the death of her six-year-old Irish sports horse Harry after he died on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A petrified Harry was found over the fence with a post buried 10 inches into his back left thigh, by Livery Yard staff in Holywell, North Wales, on Bonfire Night weekend.</p>
      <p>But after a five-hour rescue mission to get Harry to stand back up after he laid down yesterday, heartbroken Laura was forced to put him to sleep.</p>
      <p>She is now calling for a total ban on firework sales to the public to prevent more animal deaths.</p>
      <p>Laura said: ‘Harry had been doing really well, the vets had been doing a fantastic job and he was getting more comfortable walking around but on Wednesday he laid down and he just couldn’t get back up.</p>

      <p>‘We tried to help him for five hours straight but every time he tried to move, he was just making more of a mess of his leg and was clearly in pain.</p>
      <p>‘It was like he knew it was time to give up and just couldn’t fight anymore so we decided that it wasn’t fair to put him through any more pain.</p>
      <p>‘He’s just so young, it’s hard to accept that all this could have been avoided if someone hadn’t let off those fireworks.</p>
      <p>‘The only silver lining in this will be if we can help to ban the sale of fireworks to the public and protect other animals like Harry.’</p>
      <p>Livery Yard left lights on in the stables with a radio playing until 11.30pm to mitigate the terrifying effect of any fireworks on the horses.</p>
      <p>But yard owner, Lily Roberts, 25, claims two fireworks were so loud they ‘shook the house’ when they went off at around midnight on November 2.</p>

      <p>She discovered the horse the next morning impaled on the fence with injuries ‘worse than any horror movie’ after he tried to jump a hedge.</p>
      <p>He had a 10-inch wound which stretched the whole way around the inside of his back leg, narrowly missing his femoral artery.</p>
      <p>Lily said: ‘Usually I’m very good in horrible situations and know the answer to everything, but I didn’t know what to do or say.</p>

      <p>‘Harry was shaking and petrified I was going to leave him. I phoned 999 as I didn’t know what to do.</p>
      <p>‘After cutting away the remainder of the hedge we then could see the extent of Harry’s injuries but I had never seen anything like it, not even in a horror film.’</p>
      <p>Heartbroken Laura added: ‘Harry was so kind and sensible, he’s not the kind of horse that would bolt over a hedge so he must have been literally petrified by the noise.’</p>
      <p>The RSPCA has urged people to consider the effect of fireworks on animals and said Harry’s fate was a distressing example of the effects they can have.</p>
      <p>RSPCA inspector Jenny Anderton said: ‘Harry must have been laying there all night and it took us until 1pm to get him out, get him up and get him on a wagon for the vets to attempt surgery on his very serious wounds.</p>
      <p>‘It’s just so sad to think how frightened he must have been and then in so much distress while he was impaled.</p>
      <p>‘This incident really does show what the effects of fireworks can be and we urge people to be mindful of the animals around them when setting fireworks off.’</p>
