      <p><b>What this means:</b> It is of common knowledge that a rights issue is a way for companies to raise capital. In this regard, capital is raised when existing shareholders pay for the new shares that are being issued.</p>
      <p>Companies may use the raised capital to acquire assets, make a take-over, repay debts or save itself from bankruptcy. Although a company can raise capital in other ways, such as borrowing from banks or issuing bonds, there can be times when the companies may be reluctant to seek credits from banks because of the high-interest rate incurred by loans.</p>
