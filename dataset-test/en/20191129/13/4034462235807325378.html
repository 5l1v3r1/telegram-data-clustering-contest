      <h1>Nascar Champion Creates World's Longest Hot Wheels Track</h1>
      <h2>Our childhood Hot Wheels fantasies have been brought to life.</h2>

      <p>If you grew up playing with <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/a-live-action-hot-wheels-movie-is-really-happening">Hot Wheels</a>, you probably built some crazy tracks that took over the living room floor. Taking this a stage further, 2018 Nascar Cup Series champion Joey Logano has created our ultimate childhood fantasy: the world's longest Hot Wheels track.</p>
      <p>Built in partnership with Hot Wheels' manufacturer Mattel, the orange track measures 1,941 feet, which set an official Guinness World Record for the longest Hot Wheels track, beating the previous 1,838-foot track record set in Russia. The track was set up in the Nascar champion's personal garage in Huntersville, North Carolina.</p>

      <p>Using 122 boosters, a miniature <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang">Ford Mustang</a> Hot Wheels car hurtled down the circuit passing under Logano's real-life car collection including a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/expensive-failures-delorean-dmc-12">DeLorean DMC-12</a>, some custom hot rods, and a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/gt">Ford GT</a>, before jumping off a ramp and landing in a life-size Hot Wheels-liveried Ford Mustang driven by Logano, who performed a celebratory burnout. It's fun to watch grown adults turn into big kids screaming with joy as the Hot Wheels car sets a new world record.</p>
      <p>According to Mattel, the record-breaking track took over a year to plan and seven days to build. Ten people built the track and filmed the record attempt from multiple angles. "I have so many memories playing with my Hot Wheels cars as a kid, and it's fun to jump back in that space with my son, who shares the same passion for his Hot Wheels as I did," said Logano.</p>

      <p>"Hot Wheels basically founded my passion for racing - the first car I ever had was a Hot Wheels car - and now being here, setting this world record with my son and an amazing team of Hot Wheels fans is a great way to announce our new special edition Ford Mustang."</p>
      <p>Ricardo Briceno, Hot Wheels' senior director of brand marketing, added: "Hot Wheels has been pushing the boundaries in car culture with its challenger spirit, outrageous design and unparalleled performance for over 51 years. Joey Logano embodies that same spirit in his racing, which is why we're thrilled to partner with him on this record-breaking track and special edition die-cast. He's truly brought the Hot Wheels challenger spirit to life today."</p>
