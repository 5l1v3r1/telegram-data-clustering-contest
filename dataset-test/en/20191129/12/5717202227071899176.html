      <p>Senior figures at Arsenal apparently wanted Jose Mourinho to replace Unai Emery before he took the Tottenham Hotspur job.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/teams/arsenal/11873309/arsenal-wanted-jose-now-talking-to-allegri">Sky Sports News have been informed by sources</a> that Gunners chiefs were contemplating wielding the axe on the Spaniard, and considered replacing him with the Special One ‘a couple of weeks ago’.</p>

      <p>Arsenal seemingly persisted in the hope Emery could turn things around.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Spurs announced the shock departure of Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday 18 November and moved rapidly to replace him with the unattached Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was in place at Spurs the morning after the Argentine’s exit, and has already recorded two wins in his first two matches.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Has Arsenal’s dithering has cost them their top target?</h3>
      <p>It’s fair to say the majority of fans are relieved Emery has gone, but some will argue it should have happened a lot sooner.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the Arsenal board will wish they’d have acted sooner if they really did want Mourinho to succeed Emery.</p>
      <p>Time will tell if they will be made to pay for missing the boat over the Portuguese. It certainly would have been a divisive appointment.</p>
      <p>Right now though, Arsenal fans will simply be delighted for change after growing so tired of life at their club under Emery.</p>
