      <p>NEW DELHI: Angad Vir Singh Bajwa unofficially hit a world record score in the men's skeet final to lead Punjab's domination of the category at the 63rd <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Shooting-Championships-for-Shotgun">National Shooting Championships for Shotgun</a> events on Friday.</p>
      <p>Angad held off his senior and fellow <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tokyo-2020">Tokyo 2020</a> quota winner Mairaj Ahmad Khan of Uttar Pradesh, shooting a clean 60 to equal a record he also officially jointly holds with skeet legend <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vincent-Hancock">Vincent Hancock</a> and two others.</p>
      <p>Mairaj missed a couple of targets to yet again go down to the youngster after the now famous quota-winning 1-2 run by the duo earlier this month at the Asian championships in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Mairaj also had a splendid day, shooting a world record himself, a perfect 125 in qualifying to breeze into the final.</p>
      <p>Both Angad and Mairaj will be credited with national records however.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saniya-Sheikh">Saniya Sheikh</a> stopped the Punjab juggernaut, bagging her third national title winning the women's skeet event in a shoot-off with state-mate Areeba Khan 10-8.</p>
      <p>Abhay Singh Sekhon and Parnaaz Dhaliwal of Punjab also won the junior men's and women's skeet golds respectively.</p>
