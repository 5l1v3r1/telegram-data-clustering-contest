      </p>
      <p>There is a specific period for the dry cow called the transition period; three weeks pre-calving and three weeks post-calving.</p>
      <p>This is where up to 80% of all metabolic issues occur, and with the expansion of dairy farms since the end of quotas in 2015, as a dairy farmer, you simply cannot afford any major issues at calving.</p>
      <p>Farmers will not have the time, staff availability or daylight hours to effectively look after an animal. The use of a suitable and targeted <a href="https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/the-importance-of-a-successful-dry-cow-programme/">dry cow management programme</a> has the most significant influence on this period of a cow’s life.</p>
      <p>A dry cow will typically consume over 2% of their bodyweight, in dry matter (DM), daily. What you feed this cow during the <a href="https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/mineral-nutrition-getting-it-right-this-dry-cow-period/">dry period</a> will have a significant impact on body condition.</p>
      <p>Other major considerations you must measure are the current <a href="https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/the-importance-of-an-ideal-body-condition-score-for-dry-cows/">body condition</a> and silage quality. A dry cow, offered ab libitum grass silage, will eat approximately 55kg.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Even at low dry matter digestibility (DMD), this will add condition on a dry cow, and cows that are currently in ideal condition will be over-conditioned at calving.</p>
      <p>A diet that is now commonly seen on farms, in Ireland and abroad, is a Controlled Energy High Fibre (CEHF) diet. This program involves drying off the cow at the ideal body condition (3–3.25), only giving a maintenance diet for the full dry period.</p>
      <p><b>Other benefits of this diet/program include</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Savings of up to 60% of grass silage;</li>
        <li>Reducing overall dry cow diet costs compared to ad libitum grass silage;</li>
        <li>Dilution of high potassium (K) silages linked to metabolic issues;</li>
        <li>Keeping animals fit and not fat at calving with high-fibre content;</li>
        <li>Reducing overall metabolic issues at calving;</li>
        <li>Driving intake and reducing negative energy balance post-calving.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The table below outlines the two diets.</p>

        <figcaption>*1kg concentrate for final three weeks. **silage €35/t fresh; straw €120/t; minerals €1,400/t; concentrates €270/t (conventional); concentrates €290/t (CEHF).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>So, not only is this a targeted approach to feeding dry cows, but it is also more cost-effective, saving €0.24/cow/day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>For a 100-cow dairy unit: <br/>   •  €0.24 x 100 cows = €24/day x 60 days dry cow period = <b>€1,440</b></b>
      </p>
      <p>It should also result in less than 3% of metabolic issues on-farm. The stress relief on farmers is quite satisfying to see first-hand on-farm.</p>
      <p>Working as an Intouch feed specialist, I use this programme on many farms and see its success in-person. A prime example is the farm of Gerry, Conor and Owen Galvin from Listowel, Co. Kerry.</p>
      <p>They milk 440 dairy cows and use this program to effectively achieve great results.</p>
      <p>“We calved down 440 cows and have had only four cows that have retained membranes, and one of these cows had twins,” remarks Conor.</p>

      <p>“We have lost no calf and had one with milk fever. The health of the cows is brilliant. Things are going way better, and I put this down to working with KEENAN and Alltech products. Someone asked me recently if I had any cases of displaced abomasum, and I replied that I had no idea what they were.”</p>
      <p>As pointed out earlier in the article, the programme also has ‘knock-on’ effects in lactation. Peak milk yield will occur at about six weeks post-calving, but peak intake will be delayed until eight-to-10 weeks, resulting in a negative energy balance.</p>
      <p>This causes the cow to mobilise body condition/fat, which has adverse effects on the production, fertility and health of the animal.</p>
      <p>The use of this high-fibre diet, due to its rumen fill ability, will allow the cow to recover dry matter intake (DMI) quicker post-calving.</p>
      <p>This will let the cow get into positive energy balance quicker, reducing fat mobilisation. All cows will lose body condition post-calving, how much they lose and for how long will have the most dramatic impact.</p>
