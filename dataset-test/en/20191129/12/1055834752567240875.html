      <p>The fantastic Stardew Valley is set to receive the hefty 1.4 content update on the Nintendo Switch in the near future and its contents have been detailed on the game’s official <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/the-stardew-valley-1-4-content-update-is-now-available-on-steam-gog/">blog</a>. Not only is there fixes and quality of life features, but there’s also these following things to be excited for.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is <b>a new end-game mystery</b>, involving an abandoned building…</li>
        <li>Added some more character events… including <b>a new 14-heart event for every spouse</b>. I wanted to show a little more about what each spouse is up to after marriage, and give you another thing to look forward to after marriage.</li>
        <li>Added <b>Fish Ponds</b>, a new farm building that allows you to raise fish and harvest a variety of items from them. Most fish will produce roe, which can be processed further in a preserves jar. Some fish produce other things, though, and many also produce secondary items that can be useful.</li>
        <li>Added a new farm map:<b> Four Corners</b><br/>Four Corners is perfect for the new separate money option in multiplayer, since each farmer can have their own quadrant to live in. But it’s also fun for single player or cooperative farms. Each quadrant has a different perk, but the intruding cliffs reduce your total farming area. Another interesting feature is that the greenhouse, farm cave and pet area are located in the center of the farm.</li>
        <li>Over 60 new items, some fun, some practical and some powerful</li>
        <li>Added 24 new hairstyles, 181 new shirts, 35 new hats, 14 new pants , and 2 new boots</li>
        <li>Junimo Kart has been almost completely re-done</li>
      </ul>
