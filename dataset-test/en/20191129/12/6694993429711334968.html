      <h1>Manchester United fans make Paul Pogba demand ahead of injury return</h1>
      <h2>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hinted that the Man Utd midfielder could be back soon, possibly in time for the Premier League fixture vs Tottenham.</h2>

      <p>Manchester United fans want Paul Pogba to return to the side — as the team's No.10 playmaker.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-news-pogba-injury-17334610">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hinted</a> that the French midfielder could make his return from an ankle injury as early as Wednesday, for United's home clash with Jose Mourinho's Tottenham. He said Pogba would be "like a new signing" when fully fit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-news-pogba-injury-17334610">Scott McTominay</a> could also return for that Spurs clash — or even earlier with United hosting Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"So he's stepping up his recovery and let's see how soon he'll be match-fit and available," <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-news-pogba-injury-17334610">Solskjaer said on Pogba.</a> "Of course that's going to be a new signing for us, he's not really been able to play for us so when we get him back it'll be like a new world-class signing, a new world-class midfielder.</p>
      <p>"Sunday, no. Tottenham? I can't say now, because I've not been home and seen him, let's see where he's at when he comes back and starts training with us."</p>
      <p>And it seems United fans want to see a tweak of Pogba's position when he comes back into the side. The 26-year-old played in a deep-lying midfield position earlier in the season, before injury struck. He's not played for Solskjaer's side since the 1-1 draw with Arsenal on September 30th.</p>
      <p>Many United fans believe Pogba should replace Andreas Pereira in the No.10 role, or at least play a more advanced position ahead of McTominay and Fred.</p>
      <p>Here's what they're saying on social media:</p>
