      <p>Abhimanyu Mithun took 5 wickets in an over in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy semifinal for Karnataka against Haryana on Friday.</p>
      <p>Bowling the final over of the innings, Mithun delivered a sequence to remember – Wicket, Wicket, Wicket, Wicket, Wide, One Run, Wicket – to claim a hat-trick and finish his spell with figures of 5/39.</p>

      <p>Haryana went from 192 for 3 to 194 for 8 in the process of Mithun’s sensational 20th over. His victims were Himanshu Rana, Rahul Tewatia, Sumit Kumar, Amit Mishra and Jayant Yadav.</p>
      <p>Haryana scored 194/8 in their innings. In reply, KL Rahul (66 off 31 balls), Devdutt Padikkal (87 off 42 balls) and Mayank Agarwal (30* off 14 balls) unleashed an onslaught against the Haryana bowlers, chasing down the target in 15 overs.</p>
      <p>Karnataka won the semifinal and will face the winner of the other semifinal between Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.</p>
      <h3>Rare feat</h3>
      <p>Abhimanyu Mithun is the first player to take a hat-trick in all three of India’s top-tier domestic level tournaments – the Ranji Trophy, the Vijay Hazare Trophy and the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/abhimanyu-mithun-bags-hattrick-on-birthday-vijay-hazare-trophy-final-6087671/">took a hat-trick in the Vijaya Hazare Trophy final for Karnataka</a> this year itself.</p>
      <p>This is only the second instance in T20 cricket that a bowler has taken five wickets in an over – Bangladesh bowler Al Amin Hossain did this feat in a domestic T20 match in 2013.</p>
      <p>Neil Wagner (Otago vs Wellington, 2011) Bill Copson (Derbyshire v Warwickshire, 1937), William Henderson (Northern Transvaal v Orange Free State 1938), Pat Pocock (Surrey v Sussex, 1972) and Yasser Arafat (Rawalpindi v Faisalabad 2004) are the elite few who have scripted a similar feat – taking 5 wickets in an over – in First Class cricket.</p>

      <p>Mithun, 30, played 4 Tests and 5 ODIs for India between 2010 and 2011. He has also turned out for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL.</p>
      <p>In an unrelated development, Mithun was summoned for questioning in relation to the investigation into the Karnataka Premier League match-fixing incident earlier on Friday.</p>
