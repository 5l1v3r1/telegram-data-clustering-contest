      <p>The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Friday in Lagos arraigned one Adeyemi Usman, who allegedly trafficked in 967.9kg of cannabis sativa (marijuana).</p>
      <p>The agency charged Usman on one count of drug trafficking before a Federal High Court.</p>
      <p>The suit marked FHC/L/378/2019 is pending before Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo.</p>
      <p>The Prosecutor, Mr Jeremiah Aernan, alleged that the defendant committed the offence on Sept. 15.</p>
      <p>He said that Usman unlawfully transported the large volume of a restricted substance in a bus, from the Eke-Akete area of Ajah, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>He noted that cannabis was restricted by law, adding that trafficking in same contravened the provisions of Sections 11(c) of the NDLEA Act of 2004.</p>
      <p>The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>
      <p>The court adjourned the case until Feb. 24, 2020, for trial.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NDLEA Act provides for a penalty of up to life imprisonment for drug trafficking.</p>
