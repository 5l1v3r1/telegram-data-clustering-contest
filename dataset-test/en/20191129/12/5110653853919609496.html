      <p>Yes, there are games that will impact the College Football Playoff race, such as ranked meetings in The Game, Iron Bowl and Bedlam. But this extends beyond the postseason: Winners of Friday and Saturday's top-25 games can count the season as a success with just a single victory over their rivals.</p>
      <p>Highlights from this week's games include the top-10 showdown between No. 2 Ohio State and No. 10 Michigan and ranked matchups between No. 5 Alabama and No. 16 Auburn and No. 7 Oklahoma at No. 21 Oklahoma State. Other notable games include the Big Ten West-deciding game between No. 13 Wisconsin and No. 9 Minnesota and arguably the top Group of 5 game of the year in No. 18 Cincinnati at No. 17 Memphis.</p>
      <p>Here's how you can tune in and watch it all:</p>
