      <p>The Congress on Friday took a swipe at the BJP government over the GDP growth falling to 4.5 per cent, and said this is the lowest GDP recorded in six years.</p>
      <p>Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that for the BJP, the GDP was “Godse Divisive Politics”. He was referring to the ongoing row surrounding a BJP MP’s remarks on Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse.</p>
      <p>“India’s GDP has collapsed to an abysmal 4.5%. We are in a virtual free-fallWe are in a virtual free-fall. This is the lowest GDP quarter in 6 years. But why is the BJP celebrating? Because their understanding of GDP (Godse Divisive Politics) suggests double digit growth levels. All in the perspective,” he said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>India’s economic growth slipped further to hit an over six-year low of 4.5 per cent in July-September, according to official data released on Friday.</p>
