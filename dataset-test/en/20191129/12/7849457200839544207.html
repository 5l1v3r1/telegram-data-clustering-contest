      <p>And Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo said one way of showing support to the athletes is by praying for them.</p>
      <p>“Pray not only for their victory but also for them to be safe,” he said in an interview.</p>
      <p>Another way of showing support to the athletes, Pabillo said was to follow the games on television or social media.</p>
      <p>“We support them by following the games in TV and social media. We can also give them moral support through our social media posts,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Those who are able can watch the games live,” added Pabillo.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP) urged President Duterte to order the free entry of all Filipinos to all the SEAG events.</p>
      <p>In a statement, ALU TUCP spokesperson Alan Tanjusay said there are Filipinos such as ordinary workers who cannot afford the entire cost of watching the games.</p>
      <p>“Mr. President, there are a lot of workers and their families who want to watch the games to express their home grown support to Filipino athletes and help build that home grown advantage they needed but they cannot afford the entire cost of watching the games,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to reports tickets to the games are pegged at P300, P200 and P100 while prices of tickets to the opening ceremonies on Saturday, November 30 ranges from P1,000 to P12,000 per person.</p>
      <p>The 30th Southeast Asian Games will be held in Manila, Subic, Clark and in other locations in Luzon.</p>
      <p>The opening ceremony this Saturday will be held at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
