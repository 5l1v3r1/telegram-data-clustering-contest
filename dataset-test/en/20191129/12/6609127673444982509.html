        <b>AN SNP candidate axed over anti-Jewish web posts has vowed to keep fighting for election as Nats backers blasted his suspension.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/5007459/general-election-2019-snp-anti-semitism-kirkcaldy-cowdenbeath/">Neale Hanvey</a> ‘liked’ a series of social media comments branding his cold-shouldering by party bosses a “witch hunt” and “stitch up”.</p>

      <p>And another SNP supporter responding his defiant statement on Facebook even blamed Israeli intelligence spy agency Mossad for his removal as a candidate.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Thursday night, Mr Hanvey, 54, apologised for the posts he said were made “over two years ago”.</p>
      <p>But as local SNP supporters spoke out to back him, he later pledged to dig in and try to win the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat from Labour’s shadow Scots secretary Lesley Laird.</p>
      <p>Despite the SNP HQ disowning him, ex councillor Mr Hanvey will still be listed as an <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/topic/general-election-scotland/">SNP candidate</a> on ballot papers as nominations are shut.</p>
      <p>Replying to supporter on Twitter, he said: “I will carry on campaigning. The support has been truly humbling.”</p>
      <p>To another backer, he said: “I’m still a candidate, folk can still vote for me.” And he added: “I wouldn’t resign until we’ve secured independence.”</p>

      <p>In a statement on Wednesday night, Mr Hanvey admitted he “drew parallels” in social media post between Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and the Nazi Holocaust. Guidance from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance states one example of anti-Semitism is “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis”.</p>
      <p>Mr Hanvey also re-posted an anti-Semitic image from a Kremlin-backed news site of Jewish tycoon George Soros acting as a puppeteer to world leaders. The IHRA lists another anti-Semitism example as perpetrating “the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions”.</p>
      <p>Among the tweets liked by Mr Hanvey following his suspension was one saying: “Vote for Neale. He’s one of the good guys. There’s a bit of a witch hunt going on here.....”</p>

      <p>Another of his ‘liked’ tweets linked his suspension to a battle between SNP factions over planned gender recognition laws.</p>
      <p>The post said : “I thank @JNHanvey for his statement but have to say that this feels like a stitch up. He went on record 2 weeks ago against the woke faction in the party &amp; I’m sure this is him being punished for that.”</p>
      <p>Another of his liked posts said: “You’ve been shafted there pal. Hope you still stand as an independent n cruise to victory!” And other said: “No way Neale deserved to be suspended.”</p>
      <p>On Mr Hanvey’s Facebook page, he wrote: “I can confirm I will still be standing for the Kirkcaldy &amp; Cowdenbeath constituency as a candidate! My policy commitments remain and I am unequivocally dedicated to the constituency and constituents. Please keep a look out for further content over the coming days.”</p>
      <p>Among the replies, Colin Fenwick from Kelty, Fife - whose profile photo has an SNP sticker - said: “I am not going to let Mossad influence my vote!”</p>
      <p>And another indy supporter, Stephen Malcolm, said: “From what I have read there is nothing in these two year old opinions to tar him with being anti Semitic and to warrant him being removed from standing for the SNP. As an SNP member I think the leadership should have shown a backbone and stood by their candidate. Stop running scared of the right wing media.”</p>
      <p>An SNP spokesman said Mr Hanvey was no longer a party candidate, but did not comment further.</p>
      <p>Announcing the suspension on Thursday, Kirsten Oswald, the SNP’s business convener, who deals with disciplinary issues, said: “Antisemitism has no place in Scotland, and no place in the SNP.</p>
      <p>“All political parties have a duty to show leadership, and to take tough action.</p>
      <p>“Neale Hanvey is no longer an SNP candidate, and his membership has been suspended pending disciplinary action.</p>
      <p>“All support for his campaign has been withdrawn.”</p>
      <p>The SNP said it had consulted with representatives of the Jewish community in Scotland who had agreed that the action taken is “appropriate”.</p>
