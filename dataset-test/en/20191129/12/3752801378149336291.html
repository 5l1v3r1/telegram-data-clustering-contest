      <h1>PICS | 'Spider-Man' does incredible handstand on Table Mountain cable car</h1>

      <p>Dressed in a Spider-Man T-shirt, Cape Town media executive Jeff Ayliffe realised a lifelong dream when he did a handstand on top of one of the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway cars on Thursday morning. </p>
      <p>"Right at this moment, I'm still trying to absorb this experience. Undoubtedly my most difficult handstand to date, despite a tether, a fall forward was not an option," says Ayliffe on his Facebook page.</p>
      <p>"The job of shutting out absolutely everything, and finding a place of total calm, was so rewarding, and to a degree, a life spent dancing with these situations gave me the tools to have made this one special."</p>
      <p>This was handstand number 332 for Ayliffe, who has started a diary called #handstand365, where he does a handstand every day of the year in various locations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Super stoked'</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I looked the number up. It's an angelic number, that sends positivity, and makes you happy... a number that tells you everything is in order in your life, and that so far, you have done everything right..."</p>
      <p>Ayliffe has done handstands on the walls of the Castle of Good Hope, on top of Moses Mabhida Stadium, as well as on water features, a cannon, a food truck, a tractor - pretty much wherever he happens to find himself at any given time. </p>
      <p>The handstand was performed around 06:30, on a narrow beam of the cable car, halfway between the ground station and the mountaintop. </p>
      <p>According to Ayliffe, weather conditions were perfect for the handstand.</p>
      <p>"I'm super stoked that I finally bagged the cable car. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time."</p>
      <p>Ayliffe was accompanied by Ruan du Preez, who works on the cable car's mechanical components, and photographer Jacques Marais.</p>
      <p>Table Mountain Aerial Cableway congratulated Aycliffe on his feat. "An extraordinary handstand on the top of the cable car by Jeff Ayliffe during the #365handstandproject - we reckon this must of been the hardest of them all! Incredible and well done!"</p>
