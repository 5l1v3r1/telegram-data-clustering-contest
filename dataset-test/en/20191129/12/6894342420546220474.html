      <h1>AMD Ryzen 4000 Series Named In AIDA64 Update; Will Be Based On New Zen 3 Architecture</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:17:19+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/john/" target="_blank">John Law</a></address>
      <p>While AMD’s Ryzen 3000 series CPUs make their way around the desktop PC market, there are actually hints of the brand’s next-generation Ryzen 4000 series online. Specifically, the CPU series was mentioned on the official page for AIDA64, stating that the system information and benchmarking tool is primed for the CPU series.</p>
      <p>As per the listing under its “New Features &amp; Improvements” section, the program reportedly brings “Preliminary support for 4th generation AMD Ryzen desktop CPUs” and, unsurprisingly, details pertaining to AMD’s soon-to-be released Radeon RX 5500 series GPU.</p>
      <p>There’s no further information about the CPU beyond the listing, but Forrest Norrod, Senior Vice President at AMD has stated that his brand’s Ryzen 4000 series CPUs will be based on an all-new Zen3 CPU architecture and 7nm+ die lithography, rather than simply basing it on the current Zen2 architecture.</p>

      <p>On another note, Norrod also hinted that it is likely that Zen3 will deliver significant IPC (Instructions Per Clock) gains, and that the increments from Zen2 will “right in line with what you would expect from an entirely new architecture”.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, there’s still hard facts and hardware specifications for the Ryzen 4000 series just yet, and AMD’s focus is clearly fixed on its recently launched <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198397/amd-3rd-generation-ryzen-threadripper-to-be-available-25-november-retails-from-us1399/">3rd generation Ryzen Threadripper series</a> and <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198405/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-going-on-sale-25-november-priced-at-us749/">Ryzen 9 3950X</a>. That said, we could be looking AMD divulging more information about its future CPU series during CES 2020, which is scheduled to kick off in January next year.</p>
