      <h1>New rules on gift voucher expiry dates come into effect from Monday</h1>

        <b>Businesses will be banned from putting an expiry date of less than five years on gift vouchers from Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>New rules are coming into effect which will also mean shops cannot insist a voucher is spent in one transaction.</p>
      <p>The cancellation of gift vouchers, or the imposition of charges if a recipient's name is registered incorrectly, will also be banned.</p>
      <p>Ireland is the first European country to bring in legislation that protects consumers when it comes to using gift cards.</p>
      <p>Business Minister Heather Humphreys explained that some airline companies used to have particular rules around the names on vouchers - but that will be addressed under the new rules.</p>
      <p>She said: "If you got a gift voucher and the name on it was 'Liz', but your passport had Elizabeth on it... they wouldn't accept it. They'd say you'd have to pay a big fee to change it.</p>
      <p>"That's wrong. Whoever bought the gift voucher paid cash for it, and they're entitled to get the full value for it."</p>
      <p>Minister Humphreys said the legislation couldn't tackle 'maintenance fees' - referring to vouchers (such as One4All cards) without an expiry date, but where the provider charges a fee if the vouchers aren't used after a certain amount of time (e.g. a year).</p>
      <p>She noted: "I wasn't able to change that legislation, as I can't pass something in Ireland that contravenes EU legislation.</p>
      <p>"What I was able to do was write to the [European] Commissioner, and he has given me a commitment that they will look at that in any further review of the Electronic Money Directive legislation."</p>
