      <p>According to the Memphis Police Department, the incident occurred early Thanksgiving morning around 4 a.m.</p>
      <p>Police said the family was riding in a car when the mother and father began arguing. While they were arguing, the suspect Marico Owens, 42, punched the mother in her bottom lip, according to MPD.</p>
      <p>That's when police said the mother grabbed their 1-year-old son and ran into their Frayser home. Police said Owens tried to enter the home and threatened to run his car into the house.</p>
      <p>Someone who also lives inside the home let Owens inside the house, and the mother and father started arguing again.</p>

He then picked the baby up, put him back on the bed, then knocked him back onto the floor from the bed, according to police.</p>
      <p>The mother picked her child up from the floor and ran out of the house. Both victims were taken to another home about one mile away.</p>
      <p>Paramedics said the mother and child appeared to be injured, but they refused to be transported.</p>
      <p>When officers were on the scene at the first home, Owens returned to the house and asked police if police were looking for him.</p>
      <p>Owens was taken to Regional One because he claims he was tasered by someone in the house.</p>
