      <p>Gav Bolt, the lead singer for AC/DC UK, said: “We are the worldʼs most authentic tribute to the Brian Johnson era AC/DC will be embarking on their biggest run of shows in 2020.</p>
      <p>“In addition, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Back In Black tour, the band will be performing the album in full at selected shows throughout 2020.”</p>
      <p>Gav added that you could expect to see fully firing cannons, an inflatable Rosie, and iconic Angus and Brian chemistry.</p>
      <p>“AC/DC UK churn out all of the biggest hits alongside a few fan favourites at every show. The band have delivered on the biggest of stages such as Graspop Metal Meeting (2018), Stone Free (2016), Herning Rocker (2019) and more, featuring on the same billing as rock titans including Guns Nʼ Roses, Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper, The Darkness, D-A-D and many many more.</p>
