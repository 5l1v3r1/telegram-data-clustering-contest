      <p>The Gunners have confirmed, via their official website on Friday morning, that Emery has been relieved of his duties at the club after 18 months in charge. </p>
      <p>"Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues, who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand. We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success," the official club statement read.</p>
      <p>Arsenal also confirmed that Freddie Ljungberg has been given the responsibility for the first team as interim head coach.</p>
      <p>Emery's final game at the Londoners' helm came against Frankfurt, against whom his side squandered a 1-0 lead to lose 2-1 to in the Europa League on Thursday. </p>
      <p>That result followed a spate of disappointing performances that saw Arsenal go on a run of seven matches without a win – the club's worst return since 1992. </p>
      <p>The Spaniard joined Arsenal from Paris Saint-Germain in May 2018, as the replacement for club legend Arsene Wenger, and won 43 of his 78 matches in charge of the club.</p>
