      <p><b>23</b> - Centuries for <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/219889.html">David Warner </a>in Test cricket, which makes him the <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?batting_positionmax1=2;batting_positionmin1=1;batting_positionval1=batting_position;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=hundreds;template=results;type=batting">fifth-most</a> prolific century-scorer a Test opener. Among Australia openers, only Matthew Hayden (30) has more centuries.</p>

      <p><b>294</b> - The unbroken partnership between Warner and <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/787987.html">Marnus Labuschagne</a>, which ranks <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=fow_score;partnership_wicketmax1=2;partnership_wicketmin1=2;partnership_wicketval1=partnership_wicket;team=2;template=results;type=fow;view=innings">fifth on the all-time</a> list of second-wicket stands for Australia in Tests.</p>
      <p><b>0</b> - Number of bigger partnerships in day-night Tests than the Warner- Labuschagne effort. The previous <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;floodlit=2;orderby=fow_score;template=results;type=fow;view=innings">highest</a> was 248 between Alastair Cook and Joe Root against West Indies at Edgbaston in 2017.</p>
      <p><b>1</b> - Number of bigger partnerships for Australia for any wicket at Adelaide Oval. Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting shared a 386-run partnership for the fourth wicket against India in 2012, which is the highest. Overall, there have been <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;ground=131;orderby=fow_score;template=results;type=fow;view=innings">four 300-plus</a> stands at Adelaide Oval.</p>
      <p><b>2017</b> - The last time Australia had a century partnership for the second wicket in Tests prior to this series, which was against India in Dharamsala. Since then, they had gone <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;partnership_wicketmax1=2;partnership_wicketmin1=2;partnership_wicketval1=partnership_wicket;size=200;spanmin1=27+Aug+2017;spanval1=span;team=2;template=results;type=fow;view=innings">43 consecutive Test innings</a> without a century partnership for the second wicket. Now, in this series, Warner and Labuschagne have added 100-plus runs in back-to-back innings for the second wicket.</p>
      <p><b>1</b> - Labuschagne is the highest <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=1;id=2019;type=year">run-getter in Tests</a> this year and he's also the top-scorer in first-class matches in 2019. The century in Adelaide is his <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_hundreds_career.html?class=4;id=2019;type=year">seventh in first-class cricket</a> this year, also the most among all batsmen.</p>
      <p><b>6.21</b> - Yasir Shah's economy rate in this innings, his <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/43685.html?class=1;orderby=economy_rate;orderbyad=reverse;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings">second-worst</a> in a Test innings. His most expensive spell also came in Australia, in Sydney in 2017, when he conceded 124 runs in 14 overs at 8.85. Another Pakistan bowler who leaked runs on the first day was Muhammad Musa, who gave runs at 5.46.</p>
