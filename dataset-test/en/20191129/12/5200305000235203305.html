      <h1>Raveena Tandon’s role in ‘KGF’ inspired by Indira Gandhi</h1>

      <p>For the second instalment in the two-part series of period action film ‘K.G.F’, Raveena Tandon will reportedly be playing a politician whose appearance and ideology is inspired by the first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi.</p>
      <p><i>Asian Age</i> reports a source close to the team saying, “Portraying any real politician is a very big risk these days. More often than not, you have a whole lot of disapproving protesting masses who want to stop the film. She won’t imitate Mrs Gandhi, as that would look very cheap and unconvincing on screen. She has seen the way Mrs Gandhi has been played in recent films. She would rather do it her own way,” explained the source.</p>
      <p>The actress has previously essayed the role of a politician in Madhur Bhandarkar’s ‘Satta’ (2003), “but this time she will play it in an entirely different way. Her character will take on Sanjay Dutt. They will play friends-turned-enemies,” added the source.</p>
      <p>Tandon is known to be one of busiest actresses of her generation. Besides being a judge on the popular dance reality show ‘Nach Baliye’ and acting in films, the actress is busy looking after her family.</p>
      <p>When asked how she managed it all? The actress replied, “It’s all about time management. I really believe there’s nothing that you can’t do if you want to. And if you say you can’t find the time to do something, then you don’t really want to do it.”</p>
