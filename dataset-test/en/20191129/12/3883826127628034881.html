        <b>A man who shot dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow in a "brutal and evil attack" has been jailed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sana Muhammad, 35, was shot in the abdomen by Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo at her Ilford home on 12 November, 2018.</p>
      <p>He hid in the shed in his ex-partner's garden armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer, the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>Unmathallegadoo, 51, was jailed for life with a minimum of 33 years.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad's son - her sixth child - survived the attack and was delivered by Caesarean section, the court heard.</p>

      <p>On the morning of November 12, the defendant, armed with two crossbows, was disturbed by Mrs Muhammad's husband Imtiaz, who had gone to the shed to store a box.</p>
      <p>Unmathallegadoo ran into the house and shot his ex-wife with an 18-inch arrow as she fled upstairs.</p>
      <p>Judge Mark Lucraft QC described the killing as "brutal and evil", saying if it was not for the presence of her children, Unmathallegadoo would have shot Mr Muhammad too.</p>
      <p>Jurors heard Unmathallegadoo had been plotting the attack for weeks - buying two crossbows which were discovered near his ex-wife's home by a neighbour in March 2018.</p>
      <p>"You have carefully planned this attack. You had two loaded crossbows and I'm entirely satisfied you intended an attack on Sana and then on Imtiaz," the judge said.</p>
      <p>"One can only assume that you were jealous of their life together and the fact that they had formed a loving bond between themselves and with your children."</p>
      <h3>'My best friend'</h3>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad's widower previously paid tribute to his outgoing "soul mate".</p>
      <p>"She was very friendly, talkative and always made me laugh. She was my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly.</p>
      <p>"Ram must have been very jealous of the life Sana and I had and that we were living a happy life."</p>

      <p>The court heard the victim was 16 when she entered into an arranged marriage with the defendant, then aged 30, in Mauritius.</p>
      <p>Their relationship ended in 2012 after an incident where she jumped from an upstairs window and broke her ankle.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammed filed for an order which banned the defendant from going within 100 metres of her home.</p>
      <p>It was still in place at the time of the attack.</p>
