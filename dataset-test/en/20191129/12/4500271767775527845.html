      <p>Before taking the secret flight to Afghanistan, Trump had been expected to spend Thanksgiving in Florida.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States had resumed talks with Taliban insurgents as he made a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1519499/trump-makes-surprise-afghanistan-trip-voices-hope-for-ceasefire">surprise trip</a> to Afghanistan to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with troops.</p>
      <p>On a brief visit to Bagram Airfield outside the capital Kabul, Trump served turkey dinner to soldiers, posed for photographs and delivered a speech after meeting Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.</p>
      <p>It was his first to Afghanistan since becoming president and came a week after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1517623/pm-imran-welcomes-release-of-2-hostages-by-taliban-in-afghanistan">prisoner swap</a> between Washington and Kabul that has raised hopes for a long elusive peace deal.</p>
      <p>Before taking the secret 13-hour flight to Afghanistan, Trump had been expected to spend Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and to make video calls to US troops deployed abroad.</p>
