      <h1>Concerned group wants Forestry Commission to help stem illegal logging</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:24:34+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author">Mohammed Balu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tumu, (UW/R), Nov. 29, GNA - Concerned Citizens of Sissala Land, a youth group in the Sissala East Municipality has appealed to the management of the Forestry Commission to beef up its surveillance in combating illegal logging of rosewood and other species.</p>
      <p>"It appears to us that, the Forestry Commission is not doing enough to stop these illegal activities to protect the reserve. We therefore, wish to call on the manager and staff of the commission in Tumu to be on top of their job" the group stated.</p>
      <p>The group made the statement in a release issued in Tumu and copied to the Ghana News Agency.</p>
      <p>Mr Kanton Luriwie Osman and Mr Dintie​ Tayiru​ Sule, both members of the group who jointly signed the release expressed concern about the resurgence of the illegal logging activities in the district.</p>
      <p>The release mentioned a recent arrest of two persons who illegally engaged in logging rosewood in a forest reserve in Tumu on the 13th of November, 2019.</p>
      <p>"We are concerned that a forest reserve, which is under the surveillance of the Forestry Commission and as close as this particular reserve is to their main office would be so vulnerable to illegal logging activities and leaves no room for our imagination" the group indicated.</p>
      <p>The statement also indicated that on the 8th of November, 2019, an articulated truck with registration number GW-3527-W was arrested by the Tumu Police for attempting to transport freshly logged wood​ believed to be rosewood and papa (locally known as Hollo) out of the municipality.</p>
      <p>They, therefore, expressed worry over the gradual re-emergence of illegal logging activities and stated that "It is even more disheartening that, these recent activities are being carried out by our own people in conjunction with merchants from other parts of the country" the statement indicated.</p>
      <p>The group therefore tasked the forestry commission’s office in Tumu to do more to ensure the fragile environment was protected whilst calling on​ the security agencies to ensure that the culprits faced prosecution.</p>
      <p>The group called on the citizenry to be vigilant and report all individuals engaged in these illegal acts to protect the environment from degradation. ​</p>
