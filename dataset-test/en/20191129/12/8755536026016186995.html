      <p>Jennifer Aniston celebrated ‘Friendsgiving’ with her ex-husband Justin Theroux, just months after finalising their divorce.</p>
      <p>The former couple were joined by a host of their celebrity pals as Jen hosted a Friendsgiving feast, the day before actual Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Stars including Courteney Cox, Jimmy Kimmel, Jason Bateman and Will Arnett were all spotted at the dinner party, in photos and videos posted by Justin on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Jennifer also shared photos from their Friendsgiving party, including a snap of her making enchiladas for chat show host Jimmy.</p>
      <p>Last year on his show, Jimmy said people should only eat Mexican food on Friendsgiving, to save the traditional turkey and stuffing for Thanksgiving day.</p>
      <p>Poking fun at Jimmy’s request, the actress made Jimmy a popular Mexican dish, and named it, “Jimmy’s f**king enchiladas.”</p>
