      <p>There are a lot of unique gifts that fans come up with  to make their beloved idol's birthday a meaningful one; and countless ways that love have been manifested. <b>BTS V</b> fans, for example, year after year, have created significant and creative events from charity involvement, donations, to advertisements-all for expressing how important the multi-talented artist means to them, and making history each time.</p>
      <p>For BTS V's birthday this year the anticipation builds higher as fans came together to give<b> not just a star under his name- but seemingly, the whole universe for Kim Taehyung. </b></p>

      <p>It's a form of celebrating BTS V's 25th year, and lovingly appreciating his existence who captures and shares the most beautiful things; being unapologetically himself, for the artist's talents, kindness and sincerity with wishes of good health and happiness as the stars shine and guard him. <br/><br/>Another breathtaking fan project that puts BTS V in the spotlight is from <a href="https://twitter.com/TaeProjects">@TaeProjects</a> who was able to purchase, not just a star-<b>but an acre of Mercurian Land, the first time in history for a Kpop Idol. </b></p>

      <p>Mercury is the only planet with a unique rotation in solar system as it orbits in an ellipse rather than circular and was important in proving Albert Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. which according to <a href="https://twitter.com/TaeProjects">@TaeProjects</a> is befitting for Kim Taehyung (BTS V),who is beautiful and original, and is special to millions of people around the world. <br/><br/>The project does not just stand out for its uniqueness but also because of the generosity that comes with it. In purchasing the acre, <b>a simultaneous donation</b> was made to a High School for their FBLA-PBL Fund, which is the largest student business organization in the world &amp; helps over <b>230K members</b> prepare for careers yearly. Talk about being brilliant!</p>

      <p>Both birthday projects are so special and unique yet  the most important thing to remember is the heart and sincere intentions that BTS V fans hold behind them. Besides, there is no better way to establish <b>a long and memorable legacy of the love for BTS V than dedicating stars- and planets</b> to him- a way to give back some of the brightness that he has willingly shared to his fans,-the brightest star of the universe. </p>
