      <p>Baba Suwe began acting in 1971 but came into limelight after he featured in a movie titled, <i>Omolasan</i>, a film produced by Obalende.</p>
      <p>In 2011, he was alleged of cocaine trafficking by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, an allegation that was described as false and defamatory by the ruling of the Lagos high court of law.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the actor battled an unknown illness, which led to speculations that he gave up the ghost.</p>
      <p>The rumours of his death was however <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/04/23/mr-latin-rubbishes-baba-suwes-death-news-video/">debunked by National President, Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Producers Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN) Bolaji Amusan</a>.</p>
