      <p>The funeral of <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/mickleover">a Mickleover</a> mum-of-seven who died just 24 hours after getting married will take place next month.</p>
      <p>The service for Katrina Scott will be held at All Saints Church, in Etwall Road, from 11am on December 11.</p>
      <p>The burial will take place at Nottingham Road Cemetery at 12.30pm followed by a wake at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/spondon">The Bank bar in Spondon</a>.</p>
      <p>Those attending are asked to wear an item of leopard print in memory of Katrina.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old lost her fight with liver cancer at the Royal Derby Hospital on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>Katrina, who had dreamed of becoming a midwife, found out her cancer was terminal in September.</p>
      <p>She married her partner of 10 years, Jay Scott, in front of family and friends in hospital the day before she died.</p>
      <p>Her friends are now collecting Christmas presents for her children, aged between six and 22, to take pressure off her husband.</p>
      <p>Mr Scott, 48, said he wanted to thank everyone who had helped his family.</p>
      <p>He previously said: "She was in so much pain. I want her to have the best send off.</p>
      <p>"Being a dad is a job I'm proud of. It's going to be hard but people's kindness and thoughts make a bad day a little bit better.</p>
      <p>"That's how I will get through it. I'm a proud man and I don't ask for help, but her friends are keeping me strong."</p>
