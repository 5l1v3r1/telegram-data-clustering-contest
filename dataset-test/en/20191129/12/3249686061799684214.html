      <p>The charts that are used to count the PAK include Melon, Genie, Bugs, Soribada, Flo realtime chart and Instiz iChart's weekly and realtime charts.</p>
      <p>To get a PAK is to basically say that your song is the biggest thing in South Korea on release, and comparative to previous years, 2019 has been a bit slower on the Perfect All Kill scales. Only five songs have achieved Perfect All Kills, and here they are...</p>
