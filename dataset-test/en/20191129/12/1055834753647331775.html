      <p>Capcom will be allowing attendees to play at least one unannounced title and possibly more at this year’s Jump Festa 2020. Naturally many excitable gamers online have been guessing which title or titles will be unveiled and playable at the event. It seems Resident Evil 3 Remake will be the most likely candidate. However, some are crossing their fingers for a new <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Monster+Hunter">Monster Hunter</a> game on the Nintendo Switch. We shall just have to wait until the event or just before to find out what Capcom has in store. Jump Festa 2020 begins 21st December 21 to 22 at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan.</p>
