It comes with “The Last of Us,” “God of War,” and “Horizon Zero Dawn,” and all three of these games are exclusive to the <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=biipf_111919_playstation-4-black-friday-deals&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-playstation-4-1tb-only-on-playstation-console-bundle-jet-black%2F6380812.p%3FskuId%3D6380812">PlayStation 4</a>, so you won’t be able to get them for a PC, Xbox, or any other device.</p>
      <p>They’re also all very critically acclaimed games that many critics and gamers consider to be some of the best – speaking from personal experience, they’re all incredibly immersive with interesting stories.</p>
      <p>Normally, to buy this console and the included three games you’d have to shell out at least $100 – the fact that you’re getting them with the console itself at $100 off is a deal.</p>
