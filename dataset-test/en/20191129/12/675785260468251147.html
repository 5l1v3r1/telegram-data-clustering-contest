      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> has finally arrived, and while there's a slew of discounts on tech and fashion, it's a very different offer on none other than toilet roll that's getting the internet excited.</p>
      <p>As for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> , it seems the supermarket is selling 24 packs of Andrex toilet roll for just £2.56.</p>
      <p>Originally spotted by bargain hunters on deals forum <a href="https://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/24-rolls-andrex-gentle-clean-256-black-friday-deal-3346674">HotUKDeals</a>, one happy shopper spotted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tesco">Tesco</a> selling insanely cheap multi-packs of toilet roll in their local branch.</p>
      <p>Sharing their news with the site yesterday, the user said "Calne Tesco. Said to watch out instore for more Black Friday deals", as well as sharing photos of the impressive discount to prove it.</p>

      <p>There's no word from Tesco over whether the same bargain will extend outside of Wiltshire to the rest of the chain's stores nationwide, but we'll update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>
      <p>Despite the post racking up almost 2,000 likes from fellow bargain hunters, it seems that nobody else on the forum has been able to bag the same deal yet either, but it's worth keeping an eye out if you are heading into a Tesco at some point today.</p>
      <p>The toilet roll in question is the 24 packs of Andrex gentle clean, which is still appearing at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fgroceries%2Fen-GB%2Fproducts%2F302321901&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fblack-friday-shoppers-go-mad-20986141">£7.50 online on the Tesco website</a> , down from £10.25 originally.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere online, they're even more expensive, with Amazon selling their 24-piece Gentle Clean multipacks <a href="https://amzn.to/2XVSlGy">for £15.99,</a> and people even selling them <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fi%2F233194959546&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fblack-friday-shoppers-go-mad-20986141">on eBay for £11.99.</a></p>
      <p>As for the rest of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tesco-announce-black-friday-deals-20980149">Tesco's Black Friday deals,</a> they launched in stores at 5am today, with some of the top offers including an Xbox One S bundle for just <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tesco-announce-black-friday-deals-20980149">£109.</a></p>
