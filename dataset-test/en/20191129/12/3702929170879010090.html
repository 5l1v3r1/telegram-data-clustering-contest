      <h1>History behind Anwar-Hadi feud</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:47:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">Rosli Zakaria</a></address>
      <p>SERIES of events between 1999 and 2013 had led to the deterioration of trust between PKR and Pas, with the desertion of DAP, in a loose tripartite alliance (Barisan Alternatif) to improve its chances in the Sarawak election in 2001, being the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>
      <p>The level of distrust took a new turn in the present political scenario, with Pas president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang declaring his support for Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to complete his term as prime minister, voicing out against any attempt by PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to take over before the 15th General Election.</p>
      <p>PKR and Pas are no strange bedfellows as both parties had capitalised on Anwar’s black-eye incident to contest against Barisan Nasional in the 1999 General Election.</p>
      <p>Despite their previous cooperation, PKR, DAP and Pas each strives for a different political agenda. PKR believes in a multiracial composition with a reformist agenda, DAP upholds secular thrusts and Pas pursues an Islamic approach. If anything, it was a wonder that they cooperated under the banner of Pakatan Rakyat.</p>
      <p>Sources close to Anwar and Hadi concurred that the feud between the two was not personal in nature, but boiled down to the issue of leadership in PKR.</p>
      <p>The lack of consensus in the decision-making process when they were grouped in an alliance called Barisan Alternatif (BA) and Pakatan Rakyat (PR) was telling.</p>
      <p>PKR, Pas and DAP were supposed to be equal partners with all decisions made through consensus, but most of the meetings were chaired by Anwar.</p>
      <p>In 2001, DAP pulled out of the alliance to boost its chances in the Sarawak election.</p>
      <p>Although DAP maintained an understanding with PKR and Pas, it remained outside of BA.</p>
      <p>According to a political observer, after Anwar was released from prison in 2008, he tried to forge a political alliance (not Pakatan Harapan) again with Pas and DAP to face Barisan Nasional, with the hope of winning the 12th General Election.</p>
      <p>It was after this general election that Pakatan Rakyat (PR) was officially formed with members comprising PKR, Pas and DAP.</p>
      <p>The source said Anwar showed his true colours after making several decisions without engaging his partners in PR, one of which was the announcement for Baru Bian (Selangau member of parliament) as Sarawak chief minister before the 13th General Election.</p>
      <p>“He (Anwar) thought that being a multiracial party, PKR stood a better chance (of winning) compared with the other parties in the alliance, so he made the (Baru Bian) announcement without consulting Pas or DAP. It caught the partners by surprise.</p>
      <p>“Anwar’s decision betrayed the partnership. Pas felt that Anwar had put his party’s interest before the alliance’s. Pas was also critical of Baru Bian’s representation in apostasy cases,” said the source.</p>
      <p>This was followed by the Kajang by-election in 2014, where Anwar had hoped to become the menteri besar of Selangor, the source added.</p>
      <p>“Pas did not know that a decision was made to vacate the seat for Anwar, but as it turned out, Anwar’s conviction on a charge of sodomy stood and his wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, was nominated to contest the seat instead, which she won.</p>
      <p>“Pas was forced to accept the decision to nominate Wan Azizah.</p>
      <p>“PR members managed to play down the decision, but the political manoeuvring by Anwar in Kajang that had led to the ouster of the (then) menteri besar Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim affected the voter’s turnout, although PKR won the seat,” a source said.</p>
      <p>It was at this point that Pas began to feel uneasy, as it wondered if Anwar would continue to ignore its partners in the future.</p>
      <p>“Reports that Anwar was siding with DAP in the Penang local government election took Pas by surprise, as it was kept in the dark about it.</p>
      <p>“Anwar and DAP knew that Pas was against a local government election, yet they proceeded without discussing it with Pas. Pas felt betrayed by its partners,” said the source.</p>
      <p>Before the 13th General Election, Pas proposed that Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah be appointed prime minister should PR win, said the source.</p>
      <p>“PR realised that despite having a strong alliance, it was not enough to attract Malay voters. The proposal to make Ku Li (Tengku Razaleigh) prime minister was seen as a way to increase Malay votes for PR.</p>
      <p>“The proposal was raised in a meeting in the presence of Anwar, PKR secretary-general Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, PKR deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, the late Pas spiritual leader Datuk Seri Nik Aziz Nik Mat, late Syura Ulama council member Datuk Dr Harun Din, former Pas vice-president Mohamad Sabu and former Pas secretary-general Datuk Mustafa Ali.</p>
      <p>“Pas believed that as a senior politician, Tengku Razaleigh had the experience as a cabinet member (finance minister) and therefore was suitable to be prime minister. He could lead the country for a certain period before handing over the premiership to Anwar.</p>
      <p>“However, there was no second meeting to endorse Pas’ proposal. Instead, the PKR secretary-general sent a letter to Pas to inform it that Anwar would be named prime minister and that the proposal by Pas was rejected.”</p>
      <p>The source said DAP had made the accusation that Pas did not agree to appoint Anwar because Hadi had wanted the premiership himself.</p>
      <p>“Pas was accused of employing a subtle manoeuvre by using Tengku Razaleigh’s name.</p>
      <p>“These unfounded accusations against Pas infuriated Hadi, resulting in a fallout with PKR and DAP that drags on until today.</p>
      <p>“What is happening today is nothing personal, but involves a level of political distrust towards PKR headed by Anwar. It seems that history is repeating itself,” the source said, comparing it to the present situation where Anwar was waiting to be the eighth prime minister once Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad retired.</p>
      <p>A source from Pas said the party could accept disagreement on many matters, but not on its core struggles to uphold an Islamic agenda, which was challenged by DAP.</p>
      <p>True enough, DAP announced in 2013 that it would no longer work with Pas.</p>
      <p>“We could agree to disagree on many matters in PR, but not when our Islamic agenda was being challenged in such a way that even our ulama didn’t like it,” said the source.</p>
      <p>When asked whether Pas would support Anwar as the next prime minister, the reply was a firm “no”.</p>
      <p>Pas’ experience is indication enough that future cooperation with PKR is unlikely.</p>
