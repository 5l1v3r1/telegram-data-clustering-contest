      <h3>NATIONAL Capital Region Police Office director, Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas, on Thursday accepted an offer by a giant transport company to provide eight of their buses to shuttle Metro Manila policemen tasked to provide security during the 30th SEA Games for free.</h3>
      <p>Sinas thanked the management of the Yanson Group of Bus Companies otherwise known as Ceres Transport for their gesture to help the government in hosting the historic SEA Games which will officially open today.</p>
      <p>He said that the eight buses will be used by members of the Eastern and Southern Police Districts, the Manila Police District and the NCRPO Regional Mobile Force Battalion.</p>
      <p>The official said that all NCPRO officers and men assigned to SEA Games duties will also be taken good care of.</p>
      <p>“Lahat ‘yan sa first pa lang na deployment, you receive P500 saka P100, for the allowance and cellphone [load] tapos daily mayroon pa ‘yang pagkain, P100 per meal—three times po ‘yan,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sinas said they will be observing two shifts during the event.</p>
      <p>“Maski sa gabi ka naka-shift, mayroon kang allowance na P300,” he explained. According to the official, the meal allowance is only given during the daily accounting of the personnel in attendance.</p>
      <p>Sinas said that some 8,000 policemen are being joined by nearly 2,000 soldiers in seuring the SEA Games events in different parts of Metro Manila.</p>
      <p>Overall, Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant Gen. Archie Francisco F. Gamboa said that over 27,000 policemen will be deployed in four regions in the country where various sports events will be held: Metro Manila, Calabarzon region; Central Luzon; and La Union in Ilocos-Pangasinan regions.</p>
