        <b>Thousands of activists, mostly young people, are protesting on the streets of Lisbon on Friday to demand government measures to protect the planet, stressing that it is already known what the solutions are, but actions are missing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The demonstrators in Lisbon are associating themselves with another Global Climate Strike in defense of the planet, which is taking place in cities all over the world.</p>
      <p>They are almost all young and come from schools, from primary to higher education, but there are also some older activists.</p>
      <p>Today's demonstration is the fourth to be held in Portugal and has the fewest participants in Lisbon.</p>
      <p>But for the organisation this doesn't seem to be a problem.</p>
      <p>Beatriz Farelo, a 20-year-old girl who is doing Erasmus in the Czech Republic, was organising today's video call protest.</p>
      <p>She brought forward her trip home to be present and told Lusa that today's big mission is to mobilise people for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25), which starts on Monday in Madrid.</p>
      <p>However, she left the appeal: "Don't stay at home!"</p>
      <p>The demonstrators will end the protest in front of parliament.</p>
