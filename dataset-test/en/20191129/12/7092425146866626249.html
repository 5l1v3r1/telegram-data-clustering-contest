      <p>The teenagers, aged 15, 16 and 17, appeared at Highbury Corner Youth Court which was told two women were surrounded, hit with coins and subjected to sexual gestures on their way home on May 30.</p>
      <p>All three admitted threatening the same-sex couple – but they cannot be named due to their ages.</p>
      <p>CCTV from the N31 bus was shown in court and showed the boys boarding the bus first, before the two women boarded a few stops later.</p>
      <p>Ms Geymonat appeared to be trying to diffuse the situation with the surrounding teenagers as she held Ms Hannigan, who was pretending to be sick.</p>
      <p>After a few minutes, the footage shows the boys making gestures before the whole group moves around the bus and a fight ensued.</p>

      <p>The 15-year-old was seen making a "scissoring" gesture to the women on the bus CCTV.</p>
      <p>Ms Hannigan later ran toward the boys, one of whom took her handbag.</p>
      <p>A scuffle was seen on the lower deck of the bus, and Ms Geymonat was left with a bloodied nose.</p>
      <p>District Judge Susan Williams said the offence "plainly" involved the women's' sexual orientations.</p>

      <p>Both women were taken to hospital for treatment for facial injuries after the attack.</p>
      <p>Whether the incident was aggravated by the women's' sexual orientations will be decided at sentence.</p>
      <p>The 15 and 16-year-olds each admitted two counts of using threatening words or behaviour to cause harassment of distress.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old admitted one count of using threatening words or behaviour to cause harassment or distress towards Ms Hannigan, but denied being hostile towards on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
