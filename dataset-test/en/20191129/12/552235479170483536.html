      <p>Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following a break-in to Currys PC World in the early hours of Thursday  (November 28, 2019) <br/><br/>The incident happened around 4.20am at the store in the Palace Grounds Retail Park, Hamilton, where a number of Apple electrical products were stolen. <br/><br/>The suspects are described as four males, all wearing dark coloured hooded tops, bottoms and trainers with scarves over their faces. They are also believed to have had access to a vehicle. <br/><br/>Detective Inspector Brian Lindie, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “The theft from the store was clearly targeted and co-ordinated with a high value of goods stolen. <br/><br/>“We are appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time that may have seen anyone matching these descriptions, or observed someone driving a vehicle in an unusual manner to get in contact with us. <br/><br/>“As it gets nearer to Christmas, we would urge all shop owners and customers to be extra vigilant to any suspicious behaviour and report this to police.” <br/><br/>Police Scotland can be contacted by calling 101 and quoting incident number 0398 of Thursday 28 November 2019</p>
