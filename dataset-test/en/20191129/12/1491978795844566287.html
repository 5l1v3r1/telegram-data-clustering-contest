        <i>Arsenal have sacked Unai Emery following a run of seven games without a win.<br/>The Spaniard replaced Arsène Wenger and was in charge for an 18-month spell that saw Arsenal lose a Europa League final to Chelsea and fail to qualify for this season’s Champions League. <br/>Emery’s reign often seemed chaotic, with unexpected departures, nine players named captain in 18 months and the club’s highest-earner, Mesut Özil, often sidelined. However a 2-1 home defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League proved to be the final straw.<br/>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/29/arsenal-sack-unai-emery-freddie-ljungberg">Arsenal sack Emery and appoint Freddie Ljungberg interim head coach</a></i>
