      <p>(Reuters) - Malta freed the businessman at the centre of the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia on police bail on Friday, and police sources said he would continue to be closely monitored to ensure he does not flee.</p>
      <p>Yorgen Fenech, one of Maltaâ€™s richest men, was arrested last week while trying to leave Malta on his yacht. He has since been released and re-arrested four times as police struggle with a legal limit that requires suspects to be freed if they are not charged within 48 hours.</p>
