        <b>RANGERS star Ryan Jack was slammed by the Dutch media following last night's draw with Feyenoord.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5009304/rangers-ibrox-closure-fans-sectarian-chants-feyenoord/">Light Blues</a> midfielder was accused of 'sneakily' trying to injure Tyrell Malacia, in a way which would 'probably make the British inventors of the game spin in their graves'</p>

      <p>Dutch media outlets were left less than impressed with the performance of Steven Gerrard's men in Rotterdam.</p>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos hit a second half double as<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/"> Rangers</a> climbed to the top of the section.</p>
      <p>And he also came in for some criticism for his "provocative celebrations".</p>
      <p>Victory over Young Boys at Ibrox will secure first place in the group - but Gers know they will qualify for the last 32 by avoiding defeat in the final round of fixtures.</p>

      <p>Here is a round-up of what was said about Thursday's Europa League encounter.</p>
      <p><b>De Volskrant<i>: </i></b>"A young <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> got scant reward for their passionate play" against a Rangers team described as "playing rather poorly".</p>
      <p>Bart Vlietstra wrote: "The two Rangers goals from striker Morelos came from just about the only two chances for the visitors, in just about their only strong phase, while Feyenoord could have scored more".</p>
      <p><b>Voetball Primeur's</b> report says: "Rangers were completely lost in the first half as a crowded De Kuip encouraged Feyenoord to grab the Scots by the throat from the first minute.</p>
      <p>"In the end they concluded that the hosts "threw it away".</p>

      <p><b>Algemeen Daglblad</b> feel that the groups bottom side need a miracle to finish in the top two.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "The three points were there for the taking, but a weak first 15 minutes after half-time put Advocaat's team in unnecessary trouble.</p>
      <p>"Advocaat had given his former employers from Scotland plenty of compliments in advance about their level, but in the first half Feyenoord were much better than the Scots - only the team from Rotterdam have found scoring extremely difficult this season."</p>
      <p><b>De Telegraaf</b> claimed the Rotterdam club still had a 'glimmer of hope' in their bid to reach the knockout phase</p>
      <p>While<b> Nederlands Nieuws</b> claim the equaliser came out of nowhere. But they praised Morelos for his 'two fine headers'.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5009304/rangers-ibrox-closure-fans-sectarian-chants-feyenoord/">Rangers could face having Ibrox closed for their next Europa League match</a> against Young Boys if Uefa take action following reports of sectarian singing against Feyenoord.</p>
      <p>Gers have already been ordered by Uefa to close sections of the stadium on two occasions this season - for the visits of Legia Warsaw and Feyenoord.</p>
      <p>Rangers also declined to take any away tickets for the trip to face Young Boys at the start of October.</p>
      <p>Now, under Uefa's strict Article 14 rules on racism and other discriminatory conduct, they could be ordered to close the entire stadium for the final group game against Young Boys on December 12.</p>
