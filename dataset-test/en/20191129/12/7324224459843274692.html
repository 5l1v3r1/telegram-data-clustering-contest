      <p>Nicole Kidman has said she realised she “had to be OK” for her children’s sake after her father’s death.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old actress lost her biochemist father, Dr Antony Kidman, in September 2014.</p>
      <p>She told the January edition of Tatler magazine: “My three-year-old said ‘But you’re not going to be sad like this tomorrow, are you?’</p>

      <p>“That’s when you realise, y’know, you have to be OK. Because they need to know that they’re safe, that their mother isn’t going to fall apart.</p>
      <p>“Inside? I was beyond shattered. But I had to rally.”</p>
      <p>Following Dr Kidman’s death, the Australian star said she “jumped in to life”.</p>
      <p>“Let’s go on a plane. Let’s try things. Let’s go for it. Because who knows, right?” she said.</p>
      <p>“I was never going to do theatre again. I didn’t think my heart could handle the adrenaline and the fear.”</p>

      <p>The Oscar-winner took on a West End role in 2015 in Photograph 51, playing chemist Rosalind Franklin. She said at the time that it was a tribute to her late father.</p>
      <p>“I had his photo in my dressing room. I would look at it every night before I went on … It was intense. But I’m glad I did it. It was one of the greatest times in my life,” she told Tatler.</p>
