      <p>The Pussycat Dolls are reforming for a reunion tour kicking off in Dublin next year, the American girl band said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A decade after they split, the group – originally formed as a burlesque dance troupe and known for songs like “Don’t Cha” and “When I Grow Up” – will hit the stage from April in Dublin before putting on shows around Britain.</p>
      <p>“The stars have aligned and the Dolls are getting back together,” singer Nicole Scherzinger told Britain’s Heart Breakfast radio show in a joint interview with fellow band members Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Carmit Bachar and Kimberley Wyatt.</p>
      <p>“There’s been unfinished business. It’s been 10 years … we just all were ready to do it,” Roberts said.</p>
      <p>Asked if they felt differently from when they first started, Roberts – who is also a showbusiness reporter for Heart Breakfast – said: “A lot of time has passed and … we’ve matured, we’ve grown up, we’ve gained life tools, life experience.”</p>
      <p>The woman who first got them together, choreographer Robin Antin, had long called for a reunion. Fellow member Melody Thornton, who was not present during the interview, will not be part of the touring line-up, several media outlets reported.</p>
      <p>“We’re focused on the tour right now and … stretching,” said Scherzinger, who in recent years has regularly appeared as a judge on British talent show “The X Factor”. “We are working on new music and a lot of new surprises for the show.”</p>
