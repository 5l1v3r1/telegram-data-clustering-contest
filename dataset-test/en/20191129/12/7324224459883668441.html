      <p>A father who murdered his six-week-old son has been jailed for life.</p>
      <p>Lee Vernon inflicted fatal head injuries on baby McKenzie Ellis in Broadstairs, Kent, and was sentenced to life in prison on Friday, Kent Police said.</p>
      <p>Vernon, 21 and of no fixed address, was found guilty of murder and two counts of grievous bodily harm following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court in October 2019.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced at the same court on Friday and will serve a minimum term of 16 years.</p>
      <p>Baby McKenzie died at a London hospital in July last year.</p>

      <p>Kent Police said they were alerted on July 23 2018 when Vernon called the emergency services to report his son was unconscious and he had no idea why.</p>
      <p>When asked if the child had hurt himself in any way he replied “no, not really”, police said.</p>
      <p>Medical crews found McKenzie had suffered trauma to his head and he died at a specialist trauma unit three days later.</p>
      <p>In police interview Vernon said his son had accidentally fallen from his grip, causing the child to hit himself on the arm of a sofa before falling to the floor.</p>
      <p>Medical experts however disclosed McKenzie had suffered multiple injuries, some of which would have been caused on at least two previous occasions.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Richard Vickery, Kent Police’s investigating officer for this case, said: “It is impossible to comprehend the unnecessary suffering McKenzie endured during his short life and I am pleased Vernon has received a substantial sentence that means he is not able to harm another child.</p>
      <p>“This was a complex and deeply emotional case and I am grateful to the medical experts, and my investigation team, who worked tirelessly to pursue justice for McKenzie.”</p>
