        <b>The hot topic during the first few days in Abu Dhabi has been the conversations had at Ferrari following the crash at Interlagos that ended <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc's</a> race. However, Mattia Binotto has insisted what was said will be kept behind closed doors.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vettel and Leclerc were both forced to retire from the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> after the German tried to retake his position which he'd lost moments earlier. The slightest of touches caused both drivers out the race, both laying the blame at each other's door.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> boss Mattia Binotto refused to comment on what was said in the discussions after the incident.</p>

      <p><i>"There are no answers here. It's something we discuss internally,"</i> Binotto said as quoted by Motorsport.com.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"They are both very good drivers, they know exactly what to do. It's unfortunate what happened.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Is there one driver more to blame than the other? I think it's not important. Maybe that time it could have been Seb, maybe next time it could be Charles.</i>

      <p>
        <i>"There's not much to discuss. It's been between us, something we discussed at our factory, and I'm happy to keep it between us."</i>
