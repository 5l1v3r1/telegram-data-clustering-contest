      <p>Dezeen has been named Editorial Brand of the Year at the International Building Press Awards 2019 for its "well-planned and original content". The trophy now has pride of place amongst our other cups.</p>
      <p>Judges praised Dezeen for the quality of our content and drew particular attention to our <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/bauhaus-100/">Bauhaus 100 series</a>, which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the hugely influential design school.</p>
      <p>"Dezeen taps into the zeitgeist, really understands its audience and has well-planned and original content," the judges said.</p>
      <p>"There was a great deal of preparation for the Bauhaus anniversary, which paid off."</p>

      <p>This is the first year that the <a href="http://www.ibp.org.uk/">International Building Press</a> (IBP) has named an Editorial Brand of the Year at its annual awards for journalism about the built environment.</p>
      <p>Dezeen's founder and editor-in-chief Marcus Fairs received the trophy at a ceremony in London last night, which was hosted by journalist and radio presenter Nick Ferrari. Sarah Harding, marketing director of tile company <a href="https://www.marley.co.uk/">Marley</a>, which sponsored the category, presented the trophy to Fairs alongside Ferrari.</p>
      <p>The win follows Dezeen <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/11/30/dezeen-wins-two-international-building-press-ibp-awards/">being named Digital Service of the Year for the past two years</a>.</p>

      <p>The judges also noted the growth that Dezeen has seen on its site and across all of its social media channels. This <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/04/05/dezeen-record-traffic-three-million-visitors-march-2019/">March was the best month ever for traffic to Dezeen</a>, with over three million people visiting the site during the month.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Dezeen hit a social media milestone when we <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/05/22/two-million-instagram-followers-dezeen/">reached two million followers on Instagram</a>. We currently have 2.2 million followers on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>This year has also seen Dezeen exceed <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/05/17/dezeen-100000-youtube-subscribers/">100,000 subscribers on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/10/21/one-million-pinterest-followers-dezeen/">one million followers on Pinterest</a>. Dezeen Weekly, our regular newsletter,  also reached a milestone, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/11/25/weekly-newsletter-300000-subscribers/">hitting over 300,000 subscribers</a>.</p>
      <p>"The evidence is in the stats, particularly the growth on Instagram," said the IBP judges.</p>
