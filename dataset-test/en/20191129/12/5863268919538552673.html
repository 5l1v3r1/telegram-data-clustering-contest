      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb has on Friday said Prime Minister Imran Khan’s statement is synonymous with showing anger after getting embarrassed.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the premier’s remarks, Marriyum Aurangzeb said no corruption cases have been proven against PML-N till date.</p>
      <p>“The Supreme Court pointed out the government’s ineptitude time and again. PM Imran is trying to put blame of his own mistakes on others as always. Pakistan is getting unsafe due to the premier’s incompetency and lies,” she said. </p>
