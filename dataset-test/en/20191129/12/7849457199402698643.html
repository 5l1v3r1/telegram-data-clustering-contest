      <p>The Diocese of Legazpi said the prelate was asking the faithful to pray “that we may be saved from disaster.”</p>
      <p>In his Facebook page, the prelate even posted the “Oratio Imperata”, a prayer for deliverance from inclement weather and other natural calamities, for the faithful recite.</p>
      <p>The “Oratio Imperata” (obligatory prayer) read:</p>
      <p>“Almighty Father, we turn our hearts to You in gratitude for the wonders of creation of which we are a part, for Your providence that sustains us in our needs, and for Your wisdom that guides the course of the universe.</p>
      <p>We acknowledge that we have sinned against You and the rest of Your creation. We have not been good stewards of Nature. We have confused Your command to subdue the earth.</p>
      <p>The environment is made to suffer our wrongdoing, and now we reap the harvest of our abuse and indifference. Global warming is upon us. Typhoons, rains, floods, drought, volcanic eruptions and other natural calamities occur in increasing number and intensity.</p>
      <p>We turn to You, our Loving Father, and beg forgiveness for our sins. We ask that we, our loved ones and our hard-earned possessions be spared from the threat of calamities, natural or man-made. We beseech You to inspire us all to grow into responsible stewards of your creation and generous neighbors to those in need. Through Christ our Lord. AMEN.”</p>
      <p>Aside from praying, the prelate also urged everyone to prepare for the typhoon.</p>
      <p>“Let us prepare and work for zero casualty. Let us care for the most vulnerable among us,” the diocese said.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Typhoon “Kammuri” is expected to enter the Philippine area of responsibility by the weekend and predicted to probably hit Bicol region and surrounding areas.</p>
      <p>It will be called “Tisoy” when it enters the PAR.</p>
