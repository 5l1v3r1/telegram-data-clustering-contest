      <p>The very first National Worry Index of Malaysia shows a majority of the citizens are extremely worried.<br/>They worry about the economy, cost of living, jobs and security.</p>
      <p>A large number of Malaysians (46%) are also unsure about the Pakatan Harapan government.</p>
      <p>And 50% are worried about the future direction of the country and 44% are not sure if the country’s economy is on a strong footing.</p>
      <p>The Index is released by think-tank Emir Research and shows Malaysia scoring a “maximum worry” index of 0.77 on a scale of 0 to 1.</p>

      <p>It says the locals are also concerned with bread-and-butter issues since 86% are worried about the cost of basic needs and unaffordable homes and lack of job opportunities (77%).</p>
      <p>Focusing on the popularity of the Pakatan government, the Index shows 24% of Malaysians who categorically say that the country’s future direction is on the wrong track.</p>
      <p>If it is any indication of the trouble in which the Pakatan regime is, the Index shows only 24% of Malaysians think that the government is a viable one while a sizeable proportion (46%) is unsure and 30% don’t think that Pakatan is viable.</p>
      <p>The 2,000 people polled show the top concerns among different races differed.</p>
      <p>The Malays and other bumiputra races are more worried about corruption and power abuse.</p>
      <p>The Chinese and Indians are more concerned about youth unemployment and lack of job opportunities.</p>
      <p>Though many among the respondents do not seem to see the Pakatan in good light, they give the government the thumbs up for the fight against corruption.</p>
      <p>But they <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/28/malaysians-a-worried-lot-says-first-of-its-kind-national-worry-index">shoot down the controversial ‘flying car’ project</a>, which is dear to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and the Entrepreneur Minister Ridzuan Yusof.</p>
