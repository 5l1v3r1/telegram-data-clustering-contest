      <h1>Get 50% off a Christmas Tree Fir Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:30:20+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Holly Brockwell</a></address>
      <p>If you haven't bought your Christmas tree yet – and presumably you haven't because it's still November FFS – you can grab a bargain for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Hayes Garden World has renamed today 'Fir Friday' (Black Firday makes more sense but OK) and is offering deals on its fake Chrissy trees, with some up to half off.</p>
      <p>50% is also how many of the UK's Christmas trees were sold over the Black Friday weekend last year, apparently.</p>
      <p>“Over half of our Christmas tree sales happen during Black Friday weekend, as customers snap up a deal on a Christmas tree before December starts,” says Lyndan Orvis, Ecommerce Director at Hayes Garden World.</p>
      <p>"Black Friday falls a week later this year and just days before December, so we expect shoppers will be thinking about putting the tree up and will be on the lookout for a deal.”</p>
      <p>"We expect that the snow-covered trees, Bluetooth trees - which can connect to your Spotify playlist - and tall slim-shaped trunk trees, which are suitable for cat owners, will be big this year."</p>
      <p>Deals on the Hayes Garden World website, which offers free next day delivery on orders placed before 1pm, plus lifetime guarantees on its Christmas trees, include:</p>
