      <p><i>The Independent</i> has been told the Manchester City assistant head coach is once more one of the top candidates, along with Carlo Ancelotti, Max Allegri, and Wolves’ Nuno Espirito Santo.</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers has previously been highly considered, but there is a realisation he would be almost impossible to prise from Leicester City right now, and Patrick Vieira’s status has slightly lessened given a drop-off in results with Nice.</p>
      <p>Arteta had previously been very close to the job in May 2018, only for Arsenal to then decide on Emery. The former midfielder had felt a bit stung by that but is so interested in a managerial career in his own right, and has such affection for the club, that he would be willing to reconsider any offer.</p>
      <p>Arsenal had not planned to yet replace Emery, and had hoped a winnable run of games could bring the team out of the slide they’d entered, so that has meant there had been no formal approaches to a potential replacement.</p>
      <p>A few potential candidates had been sounded out through intermediaries, however, and it is understood Arteta was one.</p>
      <p>Assistant Freddie Ljungberg will now step up as interim, and there is a hope from some close to him that any good spell could see him given the job until the end of the season, not unlike Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti and Nuno would bring with them Premier League pedigree while <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-news-next-manager-allegri-arteta-ljungberg-emery-sacked-latest-a9225921.html">Allegri, who they have met with, has long sought a job in English football</a>. However, there are some suggestions he is holding out for the Manchester United job.</p>
      <p>Sources say that they are still some way off a full appointment. Arsenal decided in the international break to give Emery a run of "winnable" games until mid-December, in the hope they could restore the team's confidence and get things back on track, but it quickly became apparent after the 2-2 draw with Southampton that it would just make things worse.</p>
      <p>The Eintracht Frankfurt defeat, and - crucially - the thousands of empty seats, were seen as a nadir so the club decided to accelerate the process.</p>
