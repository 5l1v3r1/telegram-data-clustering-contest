      <p>Ashley Graham is seven months pregnant, and is set to welcome a baby boy in January.</p>
      <p>And the model has given thanks for her blossoming baby bump by posting a naked selfie of her changing body.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old shared a beautiful nude selfie, showing off her bump, on Thanksgiving and she’s giving Demi Moore’s infamous Vanity Fair cover a run of its money.</p>
      <p>Ashley posted the picture to her Instagram stories, with the snap seeing her standing to the side and covering her boobs with one hand.</p>

      <p>The model positioned a Happy Thanksgiving GIF beneath her bump to make sure the picture didn’t get too NSFW, and it’s clear that even though she’s approaching maternity leave, Ashley is still working those angles.</p>
      <p>Ashley spent Thanksgiving with her husband Justin Ervin and their family and friends, with the star posting a series of pictures of the delicious spread that they had laid on.</p>

      <p>On an appearance on The Ellen Show, Ashley revealed they are having a baby boy, and he is due in mid-January – just before the star’s 33rd birthday.</p>
