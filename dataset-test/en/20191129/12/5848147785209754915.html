      <p>A romance always starts out hot.</p>
      <p>But the honeymoon stage doesn’t last forever, particularly when it comes to you and your health fund. A recent study found that, on average, existing health insurance customers paid 34 per cent more than new customers. Further research reveals that loyal customers are often slapped with a “loyalty tax”, while new customers get enticed with special offers and even cheaper prices.</p>
      <p>While your health insurer is courting new customers with the royal treatment, it could also be increasing your premiums over time. In fact, you might have seen a jump in the past year or two already. But is this fair? We don’t think so.</p>
      <p>That’s why we’ve designed our <a href="https://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/form/step1-choosewell/?utm_source=thenewdaily&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredarticle&amp;utm_campaign=hic-december&amp;utm_content=time-to-have-the-talk-with-your-hi"><b>comparison tool – </b></a>which has won multiple awards for excellent customer service – to help you compare prices on the market from a panel of trusted health funds in Australia. Just think… how much could you be saving already?</p>
      <h3>Time to break up with your health insurer?</h3>
      <p><b>Step 1:</b> Select your current life stage below.</p>
      <p><b>Step 2:</b> Once you select your preferred coverage options, you will have the opportunity to compare quotes from multiple health funds.</p>

      <p>Nobody likes to think they’ve been replaced by a shiny new visitor. But you can’t bury your head in the sand forever. That 34 per cent price difference could potentially translate to <b>hundreds of dollars.</b></p>
      <p>Are you going to stand for this preferential treatment of another over you? Your loyalty should be rewarded, not punished.</p>
      <p>Luckily, some companies are beginning to understand the value of retaining old customers. One health insurance provider has even launched a new customer loyalty program worth $20 million.</p>
      <p>New policies and offerings are introduced with remarkable regularity. With the click of a button, you can find out whether there’s a potentially better health insurer out there for you…</p>
      <p>If there is, once and for all, tell your current health insurer you’re finished!</p>
      <h3>Get Started Now:</h3>
      <p><b>Step 1:</b> Select your <b>state below</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Step 2:</b> After answering a few questions, you will have the opportunity to compare quotes in your area and could be eligible for significant savings.</p>
