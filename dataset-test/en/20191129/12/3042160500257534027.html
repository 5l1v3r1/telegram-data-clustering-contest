      <p>An Arizona man spent Thanksgiving behind bars after authorities say he robbed another man of his burrito.</p>
      <p><b>Timothy James Bell</b>, 29, was arrested on felony robbery charges this week after allegedly stealing the victim’s burrito, a meal “of a value less than 1,000,” while hurling threats at him, charging documents obtained by <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/phoenix-man-arrested-for-threatening-victim-stealing-burrito/article_f70dc53c-0d4b-11ea-8538-674f82a889c4.html">Phoenix station CBS 5</a> showed.</p>

      <p>The incident happened Nov. 16 in Phoenix when Bell, who is listed as homeless, took the victim’s feast “by force” and “made threatening statements” during the commission of the alleged crime. Police caught him clutching the “wrapper from the burrito he stole,” after the alleged victim followed Bell until the cops arrived, according to Maricopa County court documents.</p>
      <p>He was promptly arrested and booked into jail.</p>
      <p>Authorities charged Bell, 29, with theft, a class 6 felony, because he “without lawful authority, did swipe the victim’s burrito. The <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-man-stole-burrito-arrested-felony-timothy-bell-robbery-11400748">Phoenix New Times</a> reported that theft of any property or services worth less than $1,000 is typically considered a misdemeanor. However, Arizona law states that if the property is “taken from the person of another,” then the crime theft is considered a class 6 felony.</p>
      <p>Bell, pleaded guilty to the charges Nov. 22,  and this isn’t his first brush with the law. Court documents show Bell has prior convictions dating back to 2015 for trespassing, drug possession, disorderly conduct, and weapons possession, according to the New Times. He was reportedly also on probation at the time of his Nov. 16 arrest, and has served at least two terms in state prison.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the defendant are expected to submit a motion asking the judge not to consider Bell’s prior convictions ahead of his sentencing.</p>
      <p>Bell’s next court date is set for Dec. 6 and a sentencing hearing is scheduled for Dec. 27.</p>
