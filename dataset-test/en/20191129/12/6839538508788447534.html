      <p>A record-breaking free solo climber reportedly failed to tie a crucial knot in his rope before slipping off and falling 305 metres down the face of a mountain.</p>
      <p>Brad Gobright, 31, was rappelling down the sheer El Sendero Luminoso rock face at El Potrero Chico, near Monterrey, when he tragically slid off the end of his line.</p>
      <p>He had been scaling down the renowned cliff with Aiden Jacobson, 26, when he reportedly misjudged the length of rope he had left beneath him, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10447370/brad-gobright-climber-death-mexico/">The Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>Gobright had only met Jacobson on the day of his death after posting an appeal for a climbing partner on Instagram the night before.</p>

      <p>Jacobson, who was sharing the 260m rope with Gobright for the simultaneous rappel, also fell but miraculously survived after landing in a bushy crevice on the 762m cliff.</p>
      <p>Describing the harrowing moment they both began falling, Jacobson told <i>Outside</i>: “I was on the left. He was on the right.</p>
      <p>“Then all of a sudden I felt a pop and we started dropping. It was basically a blur. I screamed, he screamed.</p>
      <p>“I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing is his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge.”</p>
      <p>Tributes to well-known Gobright have come in from across the climbing world.</p>
      <p>“The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace,” wrote Alex Honnold, focus of the Academy Award-winning Netflix documentary <i>Free Solo</i>.</p>
      <p>“He had a magic about him on the rock, unlike anyone I’ve ever met,” added Alice Hafer, one of Gobright’s regular climbing partners.</p>
      <p>“He was so supportive and encouraging, always pushing me harder and believing in me.”</p>

      <p>The pair had misjudged how much rope was left beneath them, according to Jacobson – who was left with only a broken ankle from his fall.</p>
      <p>He claimed Gobright slipped off the end of his side of the rope after failing to tie lifesaving stopper knots in it – which would have been a guide to how much he had left to rappel down.</p>
      <p>They were using the technique of simul-abseiling, by which two climbers descend opposite strands of a rope and act as counterweights to each other.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Outside</i> magazine, the men had not tied knots in the ends of their ropes, which could have been potentially lifesaving.</p>
      <p>Gobright slipped from his side of the rope causing Jacobson, who was strapped to the other side, to also plunge, according to the surviving climber.</p>
      <p>It’s thought Gobright may have neglected to tie the stopper knot on the end of his rope to stop it getting stuck.</p>
      <p>Mexico’s Nuevo Leon state civil defence office said Gobright fell about 300 meters.</p>
      <p>Gino Negrinni, a Costa Rican climber who was on the mountain at the same time, said he heard the climbers’ chilling screams as they plummeted, according to<i> Rock And Ice</i> magazine.</p>
      <p>Gobright is believed to have landed near the bottom of the cliff on a ledge known as Skull Amphitheatre, according to the mag – which hailed him as “one of the most accomplished free solo climbers in the world.”</p>
      <p>The veteran climber, of Orange County, California, had been scaling cliffs since he was seven and held multiple speed ascent records.</p>
      <p>Among his biggest achievements was his October 2017 speed record for ascending the Nose route of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.</p>
      <p>That climb is considered one of the world’s most technical and dangerous in the world.</p>
      <p>He and climbing partner Jim Reynolds raced up the nearly vertical, 884m rock face in just two hours and 19 minutes.</p>
      <p>Previous record holder Alex Honnold wrote an emotional tribute to Gobright, saying the climbing world had lost a “true light”.</p>
      <p>He wrote on Instagram: “I suppose there’s something to be said about being safe out there and the inherent risks in climbing but I don’t really care about that right now.</p>
      <p>“I’m just sad for Brad and his family. And for all of us who were so positively affected by his life. So crushing.</p>
      <p>“Brad was a real gem of a man. For all his strengths and weaknesses (like his insanely strong fingers, or living out of a Honda Civic …) at the core he was just a good guy.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, the state civil defence office said: “We extend our sympathies and support to the rock climbing community.”</p>
