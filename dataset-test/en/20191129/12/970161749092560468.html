      <p>Will Smith is keeping the spirit of his iconic 90s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air alive and well with a brand new line of athletics gear inspired by the hit comedy.</p>
      <p>The latest line includes over 40 unisex clothing items and accessories and features limited edition pieces such as the MVP Varsity Jacket – as modelled by Will Smith himself on Instagram – which will set fans back $450 (£350). The item is so exclusive, only 50 have been made. And Will’s friend and former collaborator DJ Jazzy Jeff is fan, sharing his appreciation with no less than five fire emojis under Will’s picture on social media.</p>

      <p>The collection is called Bel-Air Athletics and includes a heat-reactive tie-dye graphic t-shirt (you can’t get more ‘90s than that!), a Gridiron Crewneck inspired by a Philadelphia Eagles jersey that Will wore on the show, and a selection of branded hoodies and jumpers.</p>

      <p>Embroidered beanies, caps, socks, duffel bags, and an air-freshener which looks like Will’s character dressed in a Bel-Air football uniform complete the line of accessories.</p>
      <p>The new range went live on <a href="https://belairathletics.com/">belairathletics.com</a> earlier this week – with some extra items dropping today (29 November), in time for the Black Friday sale – and will be available until mid-December.</p>
      <p>Will’s new range comes just one month after he launched his first Bel Air Athletics collection on 1 October.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, it was recently confirmed that a Fresh Prince spin-off is currently in development, 13 years after its final episode aired in 1996.</p>
      <p>‘In addition to producing Smith-fronted film projects, Westbrook is developing a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air spin-off series (he still earns hefty royalties from the 1990s NBC sitcom, now licensed to air in 193 territories),’ claim The Hollywood Reporter, teasing that hopefully sometime in the near future Will and Carlton will be reunited on-screen again.</p>
      <p>The show ran for six season with 148 episodes, elevating Will to superstar status.</p>
