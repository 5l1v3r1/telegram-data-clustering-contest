      <h3>Choosing the best motherboard deal</h3>
      <p>If you're going down the route of AMD, you'll want to consider the X570 chipset, which offers the latest from AMD and PCIe 4.0 support, not to mention these boards will work out-the-box with the latest Ryzen processors. Our top AMD pick goes to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-X570-Motherboard-DDR4-PCIe/dp/B07T4M4XPG/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU72363YYw">MSI X570-A PRO</a> for its high-quality components, feature set, and affordable price.</p>
      <p>For team blue, we're looking at the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-Z390M-AC-Motherboard/dp/B07HM753YS/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU72363YYw">MSI MPG Z390M</a>, which is a great middle-ground in offering some high-end features at a reasonable price. You'll be able to use anything up to a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 processor with fast RAM and an M.2 drive.</p>
      <p>Be weary when shopping around. Don't bother with older chipsets like the X370 since you don't get any support for third-gen Ryzen processors and miss out on some of the more recent tech advancements. Picking from the above collection will allow you to build a capable PC that'll last years.</p>
