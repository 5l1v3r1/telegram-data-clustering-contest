      <h1>Iraqi prime minister says he will resign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:49:48+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES</a></address>
      <p>Iraq's embattled premier announced Friday he will resign in keeping with the wishes of the country's top Shiite cleric, after nearly two months of anti-government protests that have cost more than 400 lives.</p>
      <p>Adel Abdel-Mahdi's written statement was greeted with cheers and blaring music across Baghdad's iconic Tahrir (Liberation) Square, where crowds have amassed since early October against a ruling class deemed corrupt and inefficient.</p>
      <p>"I will submit to the esteemed parliament a formal letter requesting my resignation from the premiership," Abdel-Mahdi wrote, just hours after Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani called in his weekly sermon on parliament to replace the cabinet.</p>
      <p>The sermon set off an avalanche of statements from political figures in support of a no-confidence vote on the government, before the prime minister's announcement.</p>
      <p>Celebrations broke out in Tahrir, where young protesters dropped the stones they were preparing to throw at riot police and began dancing, an AFP photographer said.</p>
      <p>"It's our first victory and we're hoping for many more," shouted one demonstrator as the three-wheeled tuk-tuk vehicles used to ferry casualties pumped patriotic music into the square.</p>
      <p>"It's also a victory for the martyrs who fell," he said.</p>
      <p>The grassroots movement is the largest Iraq has seen in decades but also the deadliest, with more than 400 people dead and 15,000 wounded in the capital and Shiite-majority south, according to an AFP tally.</p>
      <p>For weeks, Sistani had called for restraint in dealing with demonstrators and urged political parties to get "serious" about reform, but he ramped up demands Friday.</p>
      <p>"The parliament, from which this current government is drawn, is asked to reconsider its choice in this regard," he said in Friday's sermon delivered by a representative.</p>
      <p>Within minutes, deputy and former premier Haider al-Abadi called on lawmakers to convene Saturday for a "special session for a vote of no-confidence and to form a new independent government."</p>
      <p>And the powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network, which had backed the government, also appeared to change course.</p>
      <p>Its parliamentary bloc, Fatah, called for "the necessary changes in the interests of Iraq."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bloodshed resumes</b>
      </p>
      <p>The sudden turnaround came after one of the bloodiest days of protests yet, with 44 demonstrators killed and nearly 1,000 wounded on Thursday in Baghdad and across the south.</p>
      <p>The bloodshed resumed Friday, with two protesters shot dead in the flashpoint city of Nasiriyah and another killed in the shrine city of Najaf.</p>
      <p>"The increasing numbers of deaths and injuries cannot be tolerated," said the U.N.'s top official in Iraq, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert.</p>
      <p>The majority of Thursday's dead fell in Nasiriyah, which counted 26 dead, including two who died Friday, from injuries suffered the previous day.</p>
      <p>In renewed rallies Friday in Nasiriyah, demonstrators encircled a police station and set ablaze five police cars.</p>
      <p>And in Najaf, a massive funeral procession snaked through the streets carrying coffins of some of the 16 people killed there the previous day.</p>
      <p>Clashes erupted there between protesters and armed men dressed in civilian clothes, with volleys of gunfire heard outside political party offices, according to witnesses.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators felt emboldened by Sistani's sermon, which was "different than the previous ones," said Ali al-Sunbuli, an activist in Najaf.</p>
      <p>The sermon began with a prayer for the protesters who died and then addressed parliament directly, not the cabinet or political parties.</p>
      <p>"It's a sign that he doesn't recognize their legitimacy," said Sunbuli.</p>
      <p>In Diwaniyah, another hotspot, protester Ahmad al-Badr said that Sistani's speech "was a big push for us."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Turning tides</b>
      </p>
      <p>The unrest in Iraq's south was unleashed after protesters stormed the Iranian consulate in Najaf late Wednesday, accusing the neighboring country of propping up Iraq's government.</p>
      <p>Tehran demanded Iraq take decisive action against the protesters, saying it was "disgusted" by developments.</p>
      <p>In response, Abdel Mahdi ordered military chiefs to deploy in several provinces to "impose security and restore order" â€“ but chaos reigned instead.</p>
      <p>Men in civilian clothes opened fire at demonstrators and tribal fighters deployed in the streets in their defense.</p>
      <p>As the death toll climbed late Thursday, the premier sacked the commander he had dispatched to Nasiriyah and the provincial governor based in the city resigned.</p>
      <p>Police officers speaking on condition of anonymity told AFP they had received orders Thursday to "finish off" the rallies.</p>
      <p>Baghdad and the south have been rocked by the most widespread street unrest since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.</p>
      <p>Protesters are seeking an overhaul of the ruling elite, accused of corruption and embezzling state funds in a country scarred by decades of conflict and where infrastructure is failing.</p>
      <p>Iraq is OPEC's second-largest crude producer but one in five Iraqis lives in poverty and youth unemployment stands at 25%, according to the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators have also called out Iraq's large eastern neighbor Iran, accusing it of political, economic and military overreach.</p>
      <p>Top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani last month convinced political factions to back the government, including firebrand cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who had called on the premier to resign.</p>
      <p>But as the tide appeared to turn again, al-Sadr resurfaced Thursday, saying it would "be the beginning of the end for Iraq" if the government did not step down.</p>
