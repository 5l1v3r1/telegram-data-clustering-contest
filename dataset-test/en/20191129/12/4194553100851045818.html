      <h1>‘Best Playmakers in World’ rankings: Three LFC stars named &amp; Firmino 4th</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:04:31+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/washngog/" target="_blank">Wash N'Gog</a></address>
      <p>The The International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics, or <a href="https://iffhs.de/iffhs-awards-the-worlds-best-playmaker-2019-lionel-messi-argentinafc-barcelona/">IFFHS</a>, has named Lionel Messi as the world’s best playmaker 2019 – and rightly so.</p>
      <p>Kevin de Bruyne is no.2 with Eden Hazard no.3.</p>
      <p>The Argentine is genuinely on another planet to every footballer when it comes to creativity. He’s not only the best goalscorer in the world, but the best passer, dribbler and the player with the most vision, too.</p>
      <p>But we’re more interested in the Reds on the list!</p>
      <p>Roberto Firmino comes in at no.4, in a vote chosen by football experts from 90 different countries…</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Gini Wijnaldum is named at no.10 – which must be based on his Netherlands form – and Mo Salah is at no.3.</p>
      <p>We’d suggest that Gini is by no-means a playmaker for Liverpool, but a dictator of tempo and a retainer of possession – but for the Dutch he scores plenty of goals.</p>
      <p>Salah creates plenty more chances than he’s given credit for, such is the focus on his goal tally.</p>
      <p>But the real question is, where is Trent Alexander-Arnold?! If the biggest playmaker of the European champions isn’t named in the top 20 – then isn’t something wrong…?</p>
