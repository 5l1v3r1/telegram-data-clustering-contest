      <p>Detectives from Bethelsdorp in Port Elizabeth are looking for a 23-year-old Nelson Mandela University student who went missing on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu says Keanan Bouwer left his house in Heath Park on the 27th at about 11 am to go to University and later in the afternoon messaged his mother to inform her that he was going to the cricket at St Georges Park.</p>
      <p>She says that was the last time anybody had contact with him.</p>
      <p>At 9 am on Friday morning police found Bouwer's car abandoned near Settlers Park in Walmer.</p>
      <p>Naidu says it is alleged that the car was parked there on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>She says the car was locked but does appear to have been tampered with.</p>
      <p>Bouwer was last seen wearing blue floral denim shorts, a black hoodie, a black Micheal Jackson T-shirt and multi-coloured Adidas sneakers.</p>
      <p>Any person with information on his possible whereabouts is asked to contact Detective Captain Kobus Williams at SAPS Bethesldorp on 071 475 1955</p>
