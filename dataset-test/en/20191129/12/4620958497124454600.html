      <p>Lower Lonsdale clothing boutique Double the Love now has twice the locations.</p>
      <p>City of North Vancouver council voted unanimously Nov. 18 to allow the hot pink cargo trailer to sell their wares at either Lonsdale Quay and a parking spot at 92 Lonsdale Ave.</p>
      <p>The trailer, which is often forced to vacate Lonsdale Quay to make room for Christmas trees, would likely sell dresses and denim on Lonsdale near Obsession Bikes in the colder months of the year and head back to the waterfront when the weather warms up, according to co-owner Zofia Rodriguez.</p>
      <p>Council approved a three-year temporary-use permit, with Coun. Angela Girard suggesting the shop would add vibrancy to the east side of Lonsdale.</p>
      <p>“It’s certainly going to bring more foot traffic,” she said. “It’s essential that we support our small, local businesses in any way we can.”</p>
      <p>The only note of caution was sounded by Coun. Don Bell, who noted mobile businesses don’t abide by the same health codes or contribute the same property taxes as their bricks-and-mortar counterparts.</p>
      <p>However, a portion of the rent paid to landlord Obsession Bikes will indirectly go to the city.</p>
      <p>“I know we get very fixated on bricks being attached to earth, but things are changing,” Valente said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we have to worry too much,” Coun. Holly Back concluded. “They seem like they’re pretty good citizens.”</p>
      <p>The company was founded in 2017 by former Capilano University classmates Zofia Rodriguez and April Robb.</p>
      <p>The trailer itself was designed to feel “like Barbie’s dream house came alive but . . . much more elegant,” Robb explained.</p>
