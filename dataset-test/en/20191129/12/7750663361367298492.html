      <p>The Easter Road men are on a roll following the appointment of new manager Jack Ross.</p>
      <p>The former St Mirren and Sunderland boss has started his Leith reign with wins over Motherwell and his old Paisley side.</p>
      <p>That has made it three triumphs in a row after caretaker Eddie May oversaw a 4-1 drubbing of St Johnstone in Perth earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Hibs now have a busy run up to the New Year celebrations, with seven Ladbrokes Premiership games packed into the space of a month.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock at home on Saturday is first up but midfielder Newell says nobody in Ross' dressing room is complaining about that hectic schedule as they look to bring the feel-good factor back after their miserable start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>He said: "After the win on Saturday against Motherwell we had the St Mirren game on Tuesday and everybody was buzzing because when you're winning you just want to keep on playing.</p>
      <p>"When there are so many games in a short spell it's always good and we have that now coming up.</p>
      <p>"It's a mentality thing. When you're on a good streak and in good form, things seem to go for you. When you're winning games you have that winning mentality-type thing and at the minute we feel like we're not going to lose.</p>
      <p>"That was evident on Tuesday night. Six weeks ago Christian Doidge's header probably would have cannoned back off the defender and hit Doidgy in the face.</p>
      <p>"But the way things are going at the minute, it's flown in to the net and helped get us the win."</p>
      <p>Newell was among 10 players signed by Paul Heckingbottom in the summer.</p>
      <p>But the recruitment drive failed and the former Leeds boss was axed after his side mustered just one win from their opening 11 league games.</p>
      <p>However, with Ross now in charge, ex-Rotherham winger Newell believes it is a fresh start for the entire squad.</p>
      <p>He said: "The new manager hasn't said much to anyone in particular, let along the new signings. He's come in and everybody is on a clean slate.</p>
      <p>"You do feel like you have to prove yourself to him but I think that's the same if you are Lewis Stevenson or a new signing.</p>
      <p>"If you've been here a long time or have just signed, you want to impress the new manager and first impressions count."</p>
