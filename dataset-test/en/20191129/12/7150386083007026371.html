      <p>In the April-October period, the central government exceeded its annual fiscal deficit target at 102.4% while it exhausted 112.5% of the revenue deficit target, according to data released by Controller General of Accounts.</p>
      <p>According to reports, China’s GDP growth slowed to 6% in the September quarter, the weakest quarterly growth rate since 1992, down from 6.2% in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>The figures come at a time when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has accepted an economic slowdown in Parliament and claimed that it still can’t be termed as a recession. In the past few months, the Centre took a number of steps to reverse the slowdown, including a cut in the corporate tax rate.</p>
