      <p>Fire cadets are making the community a safer place to live.</p>
      <p>Tiverton Fire Station is encouraging budding young firefighters aged 12-17 to join their new term of sessions which begin on Monday, January 6 and run each week from 6:00 pm until 8:00 pm.</p>
      <p>Fire cadets will be able to discover what it’s like to service in the brigade, using equipment, breathing apparatus and also look at other fire stations across the Devon and Somerset service.</p>
      <p>The crew at Tiverton’s station on Wellbrook Street hosted an open event on Saturday, November 23 for those interested to find out more.</p>
      <p>Crew manager Mark Sams said: “We have run a fire cadet programme here for nearly three years, and we are now starting again in the new year.</p>
      <p>“The course is linked with a BTEC qualification over 12 months and will also add UCAS points which help when going to college and university.”</p>

      <p>Mr Sams said that at the open day, young people had been trying on the kit, as well as learning fire safety, playing with hoses and playing search and rescue games.</p>
      <p>“Cadets almost mirror everything we do as a firefighter,” he said. “It’s pretty hands-on, and there’s also lots of technical information to absorb.</p>
      <p> “Fire cadets is a nationally recognised programme, and anyone interested in getting in touch can contact us via our Facebook page or as of Monday 6, pop down at 6:00 pm and have a chat with one of the instructors.</p>
      <p>“We take part in national events, competitions, and that kind of thing, as and when we’re happy that our cadet group are confident enough to attend.”</p>
      <p>Mr Sams said the scheme also keeps current firefighters alert and prepared.</p>
      <p>“It’s great for us here at the station,” he added. “It tests our knowledge a bit more because some of the questions we get are different from what we’re used to.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had several cadets who have been through our programme and across the two counties of Devon and Somerset who are now firefighters. If it’s a career ambition they have, I would suggest they get involved. It’s great for community and fire safety as well.”</p>
