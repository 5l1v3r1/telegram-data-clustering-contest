      <p>We all love the occasional treat takeaway, but do you know the food hygiene rating of your favourites?</p>
      <p>These are the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a> establishments who have been given a score by inspectors they probably don't want on their door.</p>
      <p>We've listed the food venues in the Durham authority area which have either a one or a zero food hygiene rating.</p>
      <p>The ratings below were taken from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) website as they appeared on November 28, 2019. The establishments in question may be awaiting re-inspection.</p>
      <p>There are 564 takeaways, sandwich shops and chippies serving food in County Durham, the majority of which have good scores.</p>
      <p>However, a total of 16 businesses were given a 'one' and one takeaway scored a 'zero' (urgent improvement required)'.</p>
      <p>The rating scheme, run in partnership with councils, helps people to make more informed choices about where to buy and eat food.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How are the ratings decided?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each business is given their hygiene rating when it is inspected by a food safety officer from the business’s local authority. The food safety officer inspecting the business checks how well the business is meeting the law by looking at:</p>
      <p>How hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored. The condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities. And how the business manages and records what it does to make sure food is safe.</p>
      <p>At the end of the inspection, the business is given one of the six ratings from zero to five. The top rating of five means that the business was found to have “very good” food hygiene standards.</p>
