      <p>Sony’s Extra Bass portable Bluetooth speakers provide a real-life concert feel to your setting. Bringing the artist to your living room or garden. Available in different sizes for both practicality and volume; you can select which will suit your lifestyle best. If you’re always on the move and want the speaker to be played in the background, perhaps opt for the XB01. If you don’t want to pull back on the volume of the speaker and don’t travel too often but occasionally, then the XB12 will be more advisable. Finally, for those of you who don’t travel frequently at home and want the greatest and loudest option plausible for a portable speaker, then I think we both know what’s best, the XB32.</p>
