      <p><a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/massiveattack">Massive Attack</a> has asked the <a href="https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/about">Tyndall Centre</a> to research touring bands' impact on the climate and formulate strategies to minimise its footprint. <br/><br/>The Bristol act announced the plans in a statement Thursday, which describes how the Tyndall Centre—a partnership of university researchers from the social and natural sciences—will "map thoroughly the carbon footprint of band tour cycles, and to present options that can be implemented quickly to begin a meaningful reduction of impact." <br/><br/>The research will focus on three areas in particular: the travel and production required for live music events, audience travel, and the impact of venues themselves. Based on the findings, a set of recommendations will be presented to greatly reduce or stop completely the climate impact of each sector. The results will be published and shared with other touring acts, promoters and venues. <br/><br/>September saw the release of <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/24291"><i>Massive Attack V Mad Professor Part II</i></a>. <br/><br/>Revisit our <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3476">feature</a> on the electronic music industry and the climate crisis from earlier this year.</p>
