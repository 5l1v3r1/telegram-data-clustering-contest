        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Do you have a loving pet that longs for never-ending attention and won’t let you leave the house without making a fuss? Then the Furbo dog camera might just be the thing for you.</p>
      <p>This smart device is like a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2017/02/24/smart-home-device-like-treat-dispensing-baby-monitor-dog/">treat-dispensing baby monitor</a>, but for your dog. It’s also got a voice feature that lets you directly communicate with your dog while you’re away. And just today, you <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Furbo-Dog-Camera-Designed-Compatible/dp/B01FXC7JWQ/?tag=tnw88-20">can grab one for $134</a> — a sweet 46-percent discount off its list price of $246.</p>
      <p>The Furbo is great for looking after your dog when you can’t be at home, and you can load it with treats to feed your pet when it gets bored — or simply needs a snack. Pretty nice.</p>

      <p>Don’t have pets? No worries, this dog camera is not just for pets, as our former Editor-in-Chief Alejandro Tauber has already demonstrated. Indeed, a good manager can employ the device to whip wayward employees into shape.</p>
