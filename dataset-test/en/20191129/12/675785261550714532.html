      <h2>The BT Sport pundit also tips Jose Mourinho's winning start to continue while there are difficult tests for Man City and Man Utd, and a bottom of the table clash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:22:38+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Savage, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-savage/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/robbie-savage">Robbie Savage</a> predicts another difficult week for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> after their run of five Premier League matches without a win.</p>
      <p>The Gunners head to Carrow Road for the first fixture in Freddie Ljungberg's interim reign following Unai Emery's sacking.</p>
      <p>They face a Norwich side fresh off the back of a 2-0 win away at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> and with hopes of sparking a resurgence to lift them out of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Across north London, Arsenal's rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> have also faced managerial upheaval, and Sav reckons Jose Mourinho's winning start will continue.</p>
      <p>Spurs got off to a flyer under their new boss with their first win on the road since January last week.</p>

      <p>And they can follow that up with another victory as they welcome the visit of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The battle for the title rolls on, and Sav feels all of the top four will get a favourable result this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> at Anfield as they bid to maintain their eight-point lead over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>The Foxes are preparing to face Everton at home, in what could be the final curtain on Marco Silva's time with the Toffees should they fail to come away with any points.</p>

      <p>Defending champions Man City are hot on the tail of the league leaders after a big victory against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> last week, but must navigate a tricky trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> , where they lost last season.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Chelsea, they're in action at home to struggling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , with Hammers boss Mauricio Pellegrini another manager under pressure.</p>
      <p>At the foot of the table <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> go head to head at St Marys with both sides in desperate need of a win.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> and Palace meet at Turf Moor, while high fliers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> and Sheffield United clash at Molineux.</p>
      <p>And rounding off the weekend's action, Man Utd prepare for the visit of Aston Villa in Sunday's late kick-off.</p>
      <p>Here's how Sav sees the fixtures panning out...</p>
