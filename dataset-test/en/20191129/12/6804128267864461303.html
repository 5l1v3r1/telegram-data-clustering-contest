      <h1>Next Arsenal manager: The man to replace Unai Emery predicted by Football Manager 2020</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery has left his role as Arsenal Head Coach today after a period of poor results and performances, but who could replace him?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:30:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Bliss</a></address>
      <p>After weeks of constant speculation regarding his future, Arsenal have today parted company Unai Emery and his staff, following a disappointing 1-2 home defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The defeat on Thursday was the final straw for the Spaniard at Arsenal, but the Gunners have been in poor form for a while now, as they sit in eighth place in the Premier League after earning just 18 points from their opening 13 games.</p>
      <p>With Emery gone, all of the focus is on predicting his successor at the club.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is available and would be a controversial choice considering his previous loyalty to Spurs.</p>
      <p>So, who will be appointed Arsenal's next manager?</p>
      <p>We used Football Manager 2020 to predict who could become Arsenal's new manager.</p>
      <h4>Arsenal's next manager in 2019/20</h4>
      <p>To set up this prediction, we loaded up the Football Manager 2020 editor and updated the latest managerial changes, including Pochettino's sacking and Mourinho's appointment, to make it as realistic as possible.</p>
      <p>We then loaded up a brand new career mode and used the in-game editor to sack Emery instantly, giving Arsenal a decision to make.</p>

      <p>The speculation about the next manager was intense over the first few days, with loads of managers linked with the vacant role at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti had to come out and deny the rumours linking him with the role, declaring himself happy at Napoli.</p>

      <p>Rumours then emerged that former Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri had interviewed for the role, but he was eventually unveiled as the new Bayern Munich manager, it was not known if he rejected the Gunners.</p>

      <p>Another candidate that was reportedly interviewed for the role was former AS Roma and Inter Milan manager Luciano Spalletti, who would certainly be another under whelming appointment by the Gunners.</p>

      <p>But, after weeks of speculation, Arsenal welcomed a club legend back to the club as manager.</p>
      <p>Patrick Vieira was unveiled as Arsenal's new manager, replacing Unai Emery.</p>

      <p>This is how the Frenchman's managerial profile looks in-game.</p>

      <p>He doesn't have any standout attributes particularly and is average in most areas, but he does excel in defensive coaching.</p>
      <p>Vieira's preferred tacitical style is 'Fluid Counter-Attack', with a preferred formation of 4-2-3-1 and a standard playing style, not particularly focused on passing or more direct play.</p>
      <p>So, there you have it, Football Manager 2020 predicts that Patrick Vieira will be the next manager of Arsenal, with the club going for a manager with previous connections to the club.</p>
