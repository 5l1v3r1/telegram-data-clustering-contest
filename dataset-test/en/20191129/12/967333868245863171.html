      <p>Washington's military equipment concentration near the oil fields in Syria's north-east will only result in escalating tensions, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bodganov said on Friday, condemning the United States' illegal military presence in the Arab country.</p>
      <blockquote>"We cannot welcome this. On the contrary, it only leads to the additional escalation of tension," Bogdanov told reporters.</blockquote>
      <p>He added that the situation would be addressed at the upcoming Astana-format meeting, scheduled for December 10-11.</p>
      <blockquote>"We will discuss these matters, the whole situation, especially in the context of ensuring a standstill and putting an end to the military presence of different sides, which is absolutely illegal and which has not been confirmed either by any international decision, I mean the UN Security Council, or by a request of the Syrian Arab Republic's legal government," Bodganov added.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier this month it was reported that a US military convoy consisting of 22 military vehicles and two trucks crossed the Syrian-Iraqi border and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911281077429571-us-military-concentrates-equipment-at-oil-fields-in-northeastern-syria---reports/">positioned itself near several oil deposits</a> in northeastern Syria.</p>
      <p>The move came amid numerous statements by US President Donald Trump underlining the main US aim in Syria as retaining control over the country's oil fields.</p>
      <blockquote>"We have our troops out of there, and we will be bringing a lot of them back home, but again we are keeping the oil," Trump said at the beginning of his meeting with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on 13 November.</blockquote>
      <p>About 90 percent of Syrian oil reserves are concentrated to the east of the Euphrates River, the region that was previously a stronghold and main source of income for Daesh* and is now mainly controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p>
