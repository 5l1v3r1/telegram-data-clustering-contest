      <p>Dell's latest XPS 15 is one of the very best laptops you can buy, and now could be a good time to buy with a sizeable discount.</p>
      <p>You can currently get the maxed-out, Intel Core i9 device for <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3csh/pubref:06-3779108-11-0000000/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-uk%2Fproductdetail%2F3kau">£1,999</a>, saving you £519.99 on the RRP. This 20% discount makes what is a stunning device so much more tempting. </p>

      <p>In addition to the immense processing power, this model will also get you a gorgeous 4K OLED display. Dell is calling it an InfinityEdge panel, with minimal bezel and a discrete webcam above the screen.</p>
      <p>A 1TB SSD should be plenty for all your files, while the mammoth 97Wh battery should help you keep productive all day. Throw in 16GB RAM and a NVIDIA GTX graphics card, and this should be adept at high-intensity gaming too. </p>
