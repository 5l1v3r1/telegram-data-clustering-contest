      <p>The Police Service Commission (PSC) has explained that it is not in conflict with the Nigerian Police over policy formulated in line with constitutional provision guiding its appointments.</p>
      <p>The Head of Press and Public Relations of PSC, Ikechukwu Ani, made this known in a statement on Thursday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said the clarification followed reports in some sections of the media over the appointment and posting of Commissioners of Police (CP) to State Commands.</p>
      <p>Ani said the stories captioned, “Concerns Mount over Constitutionality of Police Command Appointments” were built around a recent policy by the commission on the subject matter.</p>
      <p>He said another caption to the story reported on Thursday was “PSC writes IG over violation of Policy in CPs appointment”.</p>
      <p>“Although there are existing issues between the commission and the police, the issues are gradually being resolved in the interest of both parties and Nigeria in general.</p>
      <p>“The commission frowns that, what was supposed to be confidential matters involving the two government bodies is being celebrated in the media as if the two parties are on a war path.</p>
      <p>“The Commission has the constitutional responsibility to oversight the Police in areas of appointment, promotion and discipline and will continue to abide by this constitutional provision,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ani said the commission would not carry out the sacred assignment on the pages of newspapers unless there was a need to officially inform the public.</p>
      <p>He urged the media to support the two bodies in their efforts to ensure stable polity.</p>
      <p>He said the commission was regularly engaging with the police on any important issue, especially as it relates to its constitutional mandate.</p>
