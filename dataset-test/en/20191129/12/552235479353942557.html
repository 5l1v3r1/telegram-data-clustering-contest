      <h1>Perth fans run true to form on latest Jailer Tour</h1>
      <h2>Tartan Army crew soak up the success in Cyprus</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:13:21+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Perthshire Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/perthshire-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>With three consecutive wins under their belts, Scotland’s Tartan Army are in a buoyant mood - and eagerly looking forward to the Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs next March.</p>
      <p>And none more so than Perth Jailer Tours who are still acclimatising to the sub-zero temperatures - and not having a Keo beer for breakfast - after highs of 70-plus in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s date with destiny is at Glasgow’s Hampden Park on March 26.</p>
      <p>And if they can overcome Israel, they have an away tie against other semi-finalists Norway or Serbia on March 31.</p>
      <p>Jailer Tours are assured of a full bus-load of support for the Glasgow showdown.</p>
      <p>Within minutes of organiser Craig Mailer posting coach details on the group’s WhatsApp, it was soon over-subscribed and a waiting list was set up.</p>
      <p>And Craig has also been diligently searching out possible accommodation and flights for both Belgrade and Oslo.</p>
      <p>Twenty-two brave souls managed to wipe the sleep from their eyes and rendezvous for the 3.30am pick-ups to take them to Edinburgh and then via Gatwick to Larnaca for the Cyprus game.</p>
      <p>After excellent hospitality in the executive lounge at the London hub, the ‘well-refreshed’ travellers arrived at The Cactus Hotel for their three-day endurance test.</p>
      <p>And ensuring there were no parched throats there either, Jimmy Stephen who had arrived on an earlier flight had set up an ice cold beer for everyone as they stepped off the airport bus.</p>
      <p>And so it was to continue over the next three days - and nights - with piper Stuart McBain going down a storm, as always, with everyone.</p>
      <p>But in case anyone should get the idea that Jailer Tours are only interested in the amber nectar, newcomer Craig Sinclair ran a useful time in the 10k section of the Cyprus International Four-Day Challenge, despite the strength-sapping heat.</p>
      <p>And entertainments convener Ronnie Hutcheson assures me he learned a lot about the ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite, who had links with Cyprus, and the extensive complex of salt lakes, to the west of Larnaca - the haunt of 85 species of water-birds, including flamingos.</p>
      <p>Who said he needs to get out more?</p>
      <p>Oh, yes - the football. A 2-1 victory over Cyprus in the bag - least said about the game the better - the return trip via Bristol and Edinburgh saw a midnight return to Perth on Sunday for the exhausted travel party.</p>
      <p>With some of them nursing irritating mosquito bites, again a full busload saw Scotland make it three-in-a-row against Kazakhstan last Tuesday, setting up that enthralling semi-final tie against Israel in four months’ time.</p>
