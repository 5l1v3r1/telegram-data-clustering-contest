      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Caitlyn Jenner 'risks £4m fine if she bad mouths Kardashians in the jungle’</h1>
      <h2>She won't be spilling any family secrets…</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:49:27+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Nancy Brown</a></address>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner could reportedly be in for a hefty fine if she criticises her family during her stint in the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle.</p>
      <p>The 70 year old is said to be "banned" from discussing her famous family thanks to a Keeping Up With The Kardashians confidentiality clause.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And, if she breaks the clause in the contract, Caitlyn could be forced to pay Kris – who is the show's executive producer – a whopping £4 million fine.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10446049/im-a-celeb-caitlyn-jenner-4million-fine-kardashians/">The Sun</a>: "When Caitlyn signed to I’m a Celebrity, I’m sure reality fans thought they would be getting the inside secrets of the Kardashians."</p>

      <p>They added: "Unfortunately Kris appears to have put a stop to that right at the beginning of Caitlyn’s involvement."</p>

      </p>
      <p>The contract is said to state that those who sign it are warned they would "do the producer damage in the excess of $5m" – almost £4m – if they spill the beans about the famous family.</p>

      <p>She did reveal, however, that she hasn't spoken to step-daughter Khloe Kardashian for five years after coming out as transgender.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn told her campmates: "I don’t know, we were really close, I raised her since she was five years old, I really don’t know what her issues are."</p>

      <p>She added: "It’s been five or six years and I really haven’t talked to her since."</p>
