      <p>A crossbow killer is likely to die in prison after being jailed for 33 years for shooting his heavily pregnant ex-wife in a “brutal and evil” revenge attack.</p>
      <p>Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 51, burst into the home of eight months pregnant Sana Muhammad and fired an arrow into her stomach as she fled upstairs.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad, 35, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died.</p>
      <p>Her unborn son – her sixth child – was delivered by Caesarean section and miraculously survived.</p>
      <p>A jury rejected the defendant’s claim it was an accident and found him guilty of murder after four hours of deliberations last week.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Judge Mark Lucraft QC sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 33 years.</p>

      <p>He described the killing of Mrs Muhammad as a “brutal and evil attack”, saying if it was not for the presence of her children he would have shot her new husband Imtiaz too.</p>
      <p>He told the defendant: “You have carefully planned this attack. You had two loaded crossbows and I’m entirely satisfied you intended an attack on Sana and then on Imtiaz.</p>
      <p>“One can only assume that you were jealous of their life together and the fact that they had formed a loving bond between themselves and with your children. The judge said the crossbows and bolts the defendant acquired do not require a licence and can be bought online.”</p>
      <p>He said: “As is shown by events that followed, they can be used to devastating effect to kill.</p>
      <p>“Many I am sure will find the ease with which some items are available deeply concerning – it is for others to consider whether these items should be controlled and require a license for ownership.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mrs Muhammad’s widower paid tribute to his outgoing and bubbly “soul mate”.</p>
      <p>Imtiaz Muhammad said: “She was very friendly, talkative and always made me laugh. She was my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly.</p>
      <p>“Ram must have been very jealous of the life Sana and I had and that we were living a happy life.”</p>
      <p>He said his wife had been “scared” of the defendant, adding: “She would always say ‘Ram does not forgive and forget, he likes to create trouble no matter if he loses everything’.”</p>
      <p>Mr Muhammad, who attended court, went on: “She was a very loving mother and we did everything together.</p>
      <p>“Ram has finished everything. We all feel lost now. The kids are missing their mum too much.”</p>
      <p>He said their baby son was “struggling”, saying: “When I see him I feel very sorry for him because he has no mother and he has never seen a mother’s love and he never will.”</p>
      <p>He said his wife did not deserved what happened and the story the defendant told jurors to “save himself” was “all rubbish”.</p>
      <p>He said: “He came for Sana not me… His aim was only for Sana.”</p>

      <p>Her mother, Ellemah Sutharamandoo, said: “I always treated Ramanodge as my own son, I always thought of him and his wellbeing after the separation. It brings me so much pain to know that he could be capable of something so hateful and so calculated. I cannot forgive him.”</p>
      <p>The court heard how the victim was just 16 when she entered into an arranged marriage with the defendant, then aged 30, in Mauritius.</p>
      <p>Their unhappy relationship ended in 2012 after an incident in which she jumped out of an upstairs window and broke her ankle.</p>
      <p>After a trial in 2013, he was cleared of attacking her and acquitted on the judge’s direction of a charge of attempted strangulation under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861.</p>
      <p>She successfully filed for an emergency non-molestation order which barred the defendant from coming within 100 metres of the family home in Ilford, east London.</p>
      <p>Following her divorce, she married builder Imtiaz Muhammad and changed her name to Sana Muhammad. Meanwhile, the defendant lost his job as a site manager at Newham General Hospital and slept rough as he plotted revenge.</p>
      <p>On the morning of November 12 2018, he took up position in the garden shed armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer.</p>
      <p>He was disturbed by Mr Muhammad who had gone into the garden to store an empty box. The defendant ran inside the house and shot his ex-wife with an 18-inch arrow as she fled upstairs.</p>
      <p>The defendant made no reaction as he was led away from the dock.</p>
