      <h1>Cricket: DDCA ombudsman approves Rajat Sharma’s resignation as president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:56:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Scroll Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Delhi and Districts Cricket Association ombudsman Justice (Retd) Badar Durrez Ahmed on Friday accepted senior journalist Rajat Sharma’s <a href="https://scroll.in/field/943947/wanted-to-expose-the-real-face-of-ddca-through-my-resignation-as-president-says-rajat-sharma">resignation</a> from the position of DDCA President, nearly a fortnight after putting a stay on it.</p>
      <p>Sharma had resigned on November 16, citing various pulls and pressures within the organisation. His resignation was stayed by Ahmed a day later but has finally been accepted after a fresh request from the media personality.</p>
      <p>“I wrote to him in the morning and told him to relieve me of my responsibilities,” Sharma told PTI.</p>
      <p>In his letter to Ahmed, Sharma stated that he could not continue in an organisation, which is in a chaotic state.</p>
      <p>“I resigned on November 16 from post of President DDCA for the reasons stated in the letter. I however continued to honour the directions of the ombudsman and later reiterated by the High Court. However, the situation in DDCA is completely chaotic and I find it impossible to continue any further as President,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Sharma’s nearly 20-month tenure was a tumultuous one marred by public differences with general secretary Vinod Tihara, who enjoys a fair amount of support base in the organisation.</p>
      <p>Tihara won the DDCA elections contesting for Sharma’s group but had a fallout with the president within a few weeks on various cricket and administration-related issues. It included allegations that Tihara tried to control recruitment process in the DDCA without following protocol.</p>
      <p>Tihara was then suspended by the executive committee on disciplinary grounds which he subsequently challenged in the Delhi High Court.</p>
      <p>“I find it impossible to work with people who have no respect for the Ombudsman or the High Court or the constitution,” Sharma wrote in his letter to Ahmed.</p>
      <p>Within hours of Sharma’s resignation on November 16, CEO Ravi Chopra also put in his papers.</p>
      <p>The two-member Cricket Advisory Committee, comprising Sunil Valson and Yashpal Sharma, too tendered resignation. A day later, Ahmed ordered Sharma to continue and stopped suspended general secretary Tihara’s reinstatement.</p>
      <p>“It is clear that Rajat sharma has expressed his desire not to continue as President of DDCA. This entire controversy surrounding his resignation does not survive any more,” Ahmed said on Friday.</p>
