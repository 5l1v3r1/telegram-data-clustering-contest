      <p>Three men were convicted on Thursday in Denmark on charges of buying drones and other equipment for the extremist Islamic State group to use in Iraq and Syria.</p>
      <p>Between 2013 and 2017, the trio bought remote-controlled model planes, drones, thermal cameras and other components both online and at stores in Denmark, the Copenhagen city court said.</p>
      <p>The court said sentences were due on December 6.</p>
      <p>None of the three was convicted according to the strictest paragraph of the terrorism statute, which could have resulted in a life sentence.</p>
      <p>They risk up to six years for aiding a terrorist organisation, news agency Ritzau reported.</p>
      <p>The defendants – a teacher, a bicycle mechanic and a taxi driver – denied the charges.</p>
      <p>The court withheld their names.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution, the defendant who worked as a taxi driver made several trips to Turkey and took cameras and other equipment with him.</p>
      <p>The thermal cameras were used for reconnaissance prior to an August 2014 attack on a Syrian military base in northern Syria claiming several lives, according to the prosecution.</p>
      <p>Evidence included a USB stick where the purchases were listed as well as information about model planes and how to make explosives.</p>
      <p>Danish police and the police security service, PET, conducted several raids in the greater Copenhagen area, and made their first arrest in September 2017.</p>
      <p>The trial opened in September.</p>
