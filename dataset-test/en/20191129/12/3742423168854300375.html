      <h1>Should You Drink Full-Cream Milk?</h1>

      <p>The Heart Foundation now recommends full-fat milk, cheese and yoghurt <i>or</i> reduced-fat options as part of its <a href="https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/news/new-advice-from-the-heart-foundation-on-meat-dairy-and-eggs">updated dietary advice for 2020</a>. This moves away from earlier advice that recommended <i>only</i> reduced-fat dairy when it comes to heart health.</p>
      <p>So, what’s behind the latest change? And what does this mean for people with high blood pressure or existing heart disease?</p>
      <h3>What’s new if you’re healthy?</h3>
      <p>For healthy Australians, the Heart Foundation now recommends unflavoured full-fat milk, yoghurt and cheese, as well as the reduced-fat options previously recommended.</p>
      <p>The change comes after <a href="https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/images/uploads/publications/Nutrition_Evidence_papers_-_Summary_DAIRY_FINAL.pdf">reviewing research</a> from systematic reviews and meta-analyses published since 2009. These pooled results come from mostly long-term observational studies.</p>
      <p>This is where researchers assess people’s dietary patterns and follow them for many years to look at health differences between people who eat and drink a lot of dairy products and those who consume small amounts.</p>
      <p>Researchers run these studies because it is not practical or ethical to put people on experimental diets for 20 or more years and wait to see who gets heart disease.</p>
      <p>So when results of the recent studies were grouped together, the Heart Foundation reported no consistent relationship between full-fat or reduced-fat milk, cheese and yoghurt consumption and the risk of heart disease. The risk was neither increased nor decreased.</p>
      <p>Put simply, for people who do not have any risk factors for heart disease, including those in the healthy weight range, choosing reduced-fat or low-fat options for milk, yoghurt and cheese does not confer extra health benefits or risks compared to choosing the higher fat options, as part of a varied healthy eating pattern.</p>
      <p>Before you think about having a dairy binge, the review noted the studies on full-fat milk, yoghurt and cheese can’t be extrapolated to butter, cream, ice cream and dairy-based desserts.</p>
      <p>This is why the Heart Foundation still doesn’t recommend those other full-fat dairy options, even if you’re currently healthy.</p>
      <h3>What about people with heart disease?</h3>
      <p>However, for people with heart disease, high blood pressure or some other conditions, the advice is different.</p>
      <p>The review found dairy fat in butter seems to raise LDL or “bad” cholesterol levels more than full-fat milk, cheese and yogurt. And for people with raised LDL cholesterol there is a bigger increase in LDL after consuming fat from dairy products.</p>
      <p>So, for people with high blood cholesterol or existing heart disease, the Heart Foundation recommends unflavoured reduced-fat milk, yoghurt and cheese to help lower their total risk of heart disease, which is consistent with previous recommendations.</p>
      <p>Unflavoured, reduced-fat versions are lower in total kilojoules than the full-fat options. So, this will also help lower total energy intakes, a key strategy for managing weight.</p>
