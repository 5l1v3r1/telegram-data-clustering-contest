        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jennifer-aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> made enchiladas especially for <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> after she promised on his show last year to make him something Mexican for her annual Friendsgiving meal.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/friends">“Friends”</a> star shared a picture on Instagram of her Mexican creation captioned: “Ok @jimmykimmel… here are your f*%king Friendsgiving enchiladas.”</li>
        <li>She also posted a video of Kimmel seeing the enchiladas with his name on: “Finally, someone listened to me!”</li>
        <li>The TV host suggested to Aniston on “<a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jimmy-kimmel-live">Jimmy Kimmel Live”</a> that she whip up something other than turkey as “no one likes having it two days in a row.” Each year Aniston celebrates the eve of <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> with close friends.</li>
        <li>The 50-year-old’s guest list this year included “Friends” co-star <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/courtney-cox">Courtney Cox</a>, <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jason-bateman">Jason Bateman,</a> <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/will-arnett">Will Arnett</a> and ex-husband <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/justin-theroux">Justin Theroux.</a></li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jennifer-aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> has kept a promise she made with <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> on his show over a year ago – to whip up a Mexican option for her annual Friendsgiving meal.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/friends">“Friends”</a> actress shared her Mexican creation on Instagram with the caption: “Ok @jimmykimmel… here are your f*%king Friendsgiving enchiladas.”</p>
      <p>One photo depicts an eyebrow-raised Aniston holding up her meal before putting it in the oven, and then a video of Kimmel’s reaction as he noticed his special treat on her countertop.</p>
      <p>“Finally someone listened to me!” Kimmel exclaimed.</p>

      <p>On “<a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jimmy-kimmel-live">Jimmy Kimmel Live”</a> last December, Aniston said she’d cut a deal with Kimmel to not make a traditional turkey dinner for “Friendsgiving.” Each year the 50-year-old hosts the festive affair with her closest friends the evening before <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving.</a></p>
      <p>Kimmel told Aniston that while he appreciated the invite to her intimate event, he thought her menu needed a little re-working.</p>
      <p>“The problem I have with this holiday is … on Thanksgiving I cook a lot of stuff the normal turkey, yams, sweet potatoes, the whole deal but at your event, we have all of those things.</p>
      <p>“I’m making the same thing everyone had the night before again so in its essence you’ve turned my meal into leftovers.”</p>

      <p>The host instead suggested for Friendsgiving the actress sacrifice turkey for another special meal.</p>
      <p>“Alright, I’ll make you a deal… would you like it to have an Italian kind of flair?” Aniston asked. To which Kimmel proposed a Mexican-inspired dish.</p>
      <p>“I know you love Mexican food, ‘gracias giving’ could be a nice thing for us to have or ‘amigos giving,’ whatever you wanna call it.</p>
      <p>“And if you start doing it everyone will follow suit just like your haircuts, everybody gets the same hair!” Kimmel joked.</p>
      <p>While Aniston didn’t sport “The Rachel” on her Friendsgiving feast this year, Monica and Rachel were reunited as <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/courtney-cox">Courtney Cox</a> also featured on the guestlist.</p>
      <p>Her star-studded affair also included <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jason-bateman">Jason Bateman,</a> <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/will-arnett">Will Arnett,</a> and ex-husband <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/justin-theroux">Justin Theroux.</a></p>
      <p>Theroux also took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justintheroux/?hl=en">Instagram</a> posting an image of the gang together captioned:”Very VERY thankful for these friends and these nights.”</p>
