      <h1>Swanky cocktail bar The Alchemist eyes up new site in Bristol city centre</h1>
      <h2>It's known for its flamboyant cocktails</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:32:08+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>A swanky cocktail bar which had planned to open in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/clifton">Clifton</a> years ago now has its sights set on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-centre">the city centre</a> instead.</p>
      <p>The Alchemist wanted to open its newest branch <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/huge-new-cocktail-bar-coming-275329">inside the former Rise Records shop</a> on Queens Road, close to Clifton Triangle, by April 2018.</p>
      <p>But cocktail lovers were told they would have to wait until early 2019 for the opening due to a setback.</p>
      <p>At the time The Alchemist claimed the delay was because it was 'taking the time to get to know the city' - but the real reason behind the setback was because <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> believed the plan was 'harmful' and refused to grant it planning permission, as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/real-reason-alchemist-bristol-never-1599182">reported by Bristol Live in May 2018</a>.</p>

      <p>As the building in question was designated for retail and restaurant use, an application from The Alchemist to turn it into a bar and restaurant was refused by the council, which claimed the transition would harm the area's shopping potential and would make existing antisocial behaviour and noise to nearby residents worse.</p>
      <p>With no update from the The Alchemist since then, it looked like it could have spelled the end of the chain's attempts to open in Bristol - until now.</p>
      <p>The chain has submitted a licensing application to Bristol City Council to open at 41 Corn Street, most recently home to Pranji's bar, which closed in 2017.</p>
      <p>The notice requests the sale of alcohol until midnight Sunday to Wednesday, 12.30am on Thursday and 1am on Friday and Saturday.</p>

      <p>With venues across the UK, including in Cardiff, Birmingham, London and Birmingham, The Alchemist is known for its flamboyant cocktails, combining alcohol with science.</p>
      <p>The bartenders are "masters in the dark arts of molecular mixology and demons in the kitchen," who always put on a show for customers.</p>
      <p>Its Cardiff bar has a rating of 4 /5 on TripAdvisor from 292 reviews, with many people praising the 'interesting cocktails'.</p>
      <p>We'll be watching this space closely...</p>
