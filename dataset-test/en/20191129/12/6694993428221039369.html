      <h1>Vernon Kay denies split from Strictly's Tess Daly</h1>
      <h2>The TV host has kept under the radar for quite some time as Tess spends her weekends fronting Strictly Come Dancing on BBC</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:10:33+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Sansome, https://www.facebook.com/jesssansomejournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Vernon Kay has addressed speculation that he has split from his wife Tess Daly.</p>
      <p>The TV host has kept under the radar for quite some time as Tess spends her weekends fronting <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> on <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC.</a></p>
      <p>But it left fans speculating about the pairs status after not being pictured together in months - when they both attended Elton John's AIDS Foundation part in July.</p>
      <p>In an unintentional bid to silence the critics, Vernon took to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to post a snap of his two daughters he shares with Tess - Phoebe, 15, and Amber, 10 - on the beach on a recent holiday.</p>
      <p>He captioned the image: "After being in the Middle East for a week, no better feeling than coming home."</p>

      <p>And whilst that didn't really address any rumours, he took particular aim at a fans comment.</p>
      <p>"Feels like you and @tessdaly are living separate lives. I hope not. Love you guys," someone wrote below the post.</p>
      <p>But the All Star Family Fortunes presenter didn't take too kindly responding: "Pictures of our family life are all labelled nicely on an iPad or in Apple photo books for us to share, as a family.</p>

      <p>"No need to invite the world into our home life, some do, but it's not for us. We are [100 emoji]. Thanks for asking."</p>
      <p>Though fans may have missed that Tess commented on the post writing: "My birthday trip. Special memories."</p>
