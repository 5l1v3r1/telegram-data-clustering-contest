        <b>Emmerdale left viewers in tears all across the nation last night as mainstay Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/emmerdale-spoilers-bernice-left-exit-11228824/">departed the village</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The unlucky-in-love beautician’s happy ending was imminent, as she prepared to marry love of her life Liam (Jonny McPherson). However, daughter Dee Dee later received a call, and was left devastated by what she’d heard.</p>
      <p>Bernice was left shell-shocked to discover that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/who-is-dee-dees-dad-in-emmerdale-11228804/">Dee Dee’s dad has been in an accident and is in intensive care</a>.</p>
      <p>As she deliberated over what to do for the best, she ultimately decided to put her daughter before her own happiness, and thus — after bidding adieu to Diane (Elizabeth Estensen), Nicola (Nicola Wheeler) and man of her dreams Liam — she got in a taxi with Dee Dee and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/bernice-leaving-emmerdale-for-good-will-samantha-giles-return-11232223/">left Emmerdale behind</a>.</p>
      <p>Viewers knew that actress Samantha Giles <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/emmerdale-spoilers-wedding-exit-revealed-for-broken-bernice-blackstock-11005262/">would be departing</a>, so Bernice’s exit wasn’t exactly a surprise, but that didn’t make it any less heart-breaking.</p>

      <p>Speaking about her emotional exit during an appearance on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a>, actress Samantha said: ‘No, I didn’t cry, I did so much crying on the filming. I don’t like watching myself – I did watch last night just to close the door on it.’</p>
      <p>Elaborating on her decision to leave the soap, she told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langford: ‘I just felt it was the right time, thinking about it for a couple of years, I got itchy feet, I want to do some other stuff, play something more gritty.’</p>

      <p>Speaking about whether or not she minded if her character had been killed off, she said: ‘I said I don’t mind what they did, I wouldn’t’ have minded if they did, I don’t think you can ask to leave and then say ‘don’t kill me off’ but they wanted to leave it open.’</p>
      <p>Of course, long-time Emmerdale viewers will know that this isn’t the first time Samantha’s left the soap, so could we perhaps see a return for Bernice in the future?</p>
      <p>Samantha said: ‘Never say never but for now the door is closed.’</p>
