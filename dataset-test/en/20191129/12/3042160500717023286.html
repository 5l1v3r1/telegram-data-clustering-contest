      <h1>‘These Characters Are Beloved’: Kim Fields Talks About the Possibility of a ‘Living Single’ Reboot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:15:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://atlantablackstar.com/author/dnelson/" target="_blank">Daryl Nelson</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/kim-fields/"><b>Kim Fields</b></a> was a guest on the <b>“Tamron Hall Show”</b> on Thursday for the show’s “Throwback Week,” where she promoted her Lifetime movie “You Light Up My Christmas,” set to air Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>But she also talked about a “Living Single” reboot, the sitcom that centered on four black women who shared a brownstone in New York City. The series aired on Fox and ran from 1993 to 1998.</p>
      <p>Fields played the stylish Regine Hunter on the show, which was created by Yvette Lee Bowser. <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/queen-latifah/"><b>Queen Latifah</b></a> played Khadijah James, <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/erika-alexander/"><b>Erika Alexander</b></a> was Maxine Shaw and <b>Kim Coles</b> Synclaire James.</p>

      <p>The series also included <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/t-c-carson/"><b>T.C. Carson</b></a> as Kyle Barker — Shaw’s archnemesis and eventual lover — while <b>John Henton</b> played Overton Wakefield, James’ love interest.</p>
      <p>“We have talked about it a little bit, the six of us and Yvette,” said Fields about an idea of a reboot. “A lot of it deals with our schedule, because, praise God, everyone is working, everybody is busy, everybody’s got stuff to do.”</p>
      <p>“When Yvette asked, I said I would definitely be interested in seeing what that conversation is and being able to do it,” she added. “But here’s the thing, with reboots you got to be careful because these characters are beloved and those storylines really meant something and they still resonate now. So don’t mess around, you got to get it right.”</p>
      <p>Fields was also asked why the “Living Single” characters resonated with viewers so much.</p>
      <p>“Yvette, who created these wonderful characters and this wonderful show … She just set out to make good TV and to write what she knew, which was these relationships,” she answered. “Our chemistry was definitely lightning in a bottle.”</p>
      <p>And even though Fields didn’t say a “Living Single” reboot was definitely coming, people expressed a lot of excitement about the sheer possibility.</p>
      <p>“I PRAY that show comes back at least for a 2 week special. Maxine Shaw is still my idol,” someone wrote.</p>
      <p>“I hope they can do a reboot or follow up,” wrote another fan of the show. “‘Living Single’ was ‘Girlfriends’ before ‘Girlfriends.’ It would be nice actually to see both shows closed out properly.”</p>
