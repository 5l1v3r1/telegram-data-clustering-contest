      <p>Alison Hammond accidentally misgendered Caitlyn Jenner twice today live on This Morning.</p>
      <p>The popular TV presenter made an unfortunate mistake and used the wrong pronouns while discussing Caitlyn Jenner's Geordie-isms.</p>
      <p>Alison said: "They are just loving Caitlyn at the moment. He keeps coming up with these Geordie sayings every time Ant and Dec come into the jungle. So he’s officially a Geordie."</p>
      <p>Seemingly spotting the mistake, presenter Ruth Langsford quickly stepped in to correct her co-host.</p>
      <p>Ruth said: "She is very funny. She is very, very funny. She’s got wit."</p>

      <p>This Morning viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after hearing Alison's mistake.</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "Oops Alison. Quite the slip just then!"</p>

      <p>A third said: "Alison just slipped up then. She!"</p>

      <p>This came after Alison revealed that one I'm A Celebrity contestant will be leaving the jungle on tonight's show.</p>
      <p>Alison pleaded with viewers to vote to save Caitlyn, even though she is a firm favourite to win, as Noel Edmonds was the shock first exit last year.</p>
      <p>She said: "Last year the surprise was Noel. No one thought he would leave. If you don’t vote for your favourite you could lose Caitlyn."</p>

      <p>At the moment, Radio DJ Adele Roberts and comedian Andrew Maxwell are the bookies' favourites to be given the chop.</p>
      <p>They are closely followed by former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi, which Alison believes is because he "sleeps all the time".</p>
      <p>Who would you like to leave the jungle camp?</p>
