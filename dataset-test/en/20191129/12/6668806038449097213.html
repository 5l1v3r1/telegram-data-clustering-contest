      <p>Taapsee Pannu had an eventful 2019 with four movie releases Badla, Game Over, Mission Mangal and the latest being Saand Ki Aankh. She also has several films in her kitty and has been shooting back to back for them. Taapsee will soon be seen in Tadka, Thappad and also Rashmi Rocket. Now as per reports, Taapsee has signed one more film which will be a romantic-thriller.</p>
      <p>In the untitled film, Taapsee is paired opposite Vikrant Massey who’ll be seen alongside Deepika Padukone in Chhapaak. Talking about the movie, a source informed a leading daily, "The makers thought a fresh pair would work in the film’s favour as it will keep the mystery element intact since there will be no preconceived notions about them as a couple." The source further added that the film will be shot in North India but the location is not finalised yet. </p>
