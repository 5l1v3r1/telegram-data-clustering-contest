      <h1>Premier League consider the future of incoming chief executive David Pemsel following allegations made about his private life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:53:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Wallace, Chief Football Writer , Ben Rumsby, Tom Morgan, Sports News Correspondent , Jason Burt, Chief Football Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Premier League is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/02/premier-league-appoint-david-pemsel-new-chief-executive/">considering the future of incoming chief executive David Pemsel</a> following allegations made about the organisation’s new leader’s private life this week, <i>Telegraph Sport</i> understands.</p>
      <p>Pemsel, 51, is the long-awaited successor to Richard Scudamore and the organisation is currently seeking to clarify the truth around allegations about Pemsel reported in The Sun newspaper on Thursday. They came as a surprise to the Premier League when they emerged on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Pemsel is not due to take up the role until the end of February. The Premier League has become the most lucrative domestic sport competition in the world with a broadcast rights deal of £9.2 billion for the current three-year cycle. The league has previously offered the job to two candidates<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/06/07/premier-league-executive-chairman-richard-scudamore-stand-almost/">since Scudamore first served notice that he was quitting in June last year</a> and both putative appointments have fallen by the wayside.</p>
      <p>Pemsel is serving his notice as chief executive of the Guardian Media Group where he was credited with overseeing the media organisation turn a profit for the first time in 20 years. There has been no comment from the Premier League following the original reports emerging on Wednesday night. Since then there have been discussions in private between executives and stakeholders about how best to proceed.</p>
      <p>There will be consultation with all 20 clubs for whom the appointment of a new chief executive is crucial. The process was handled by the Premier League nominations committee led by Bruce Buck, the Chelsea chairman. Also on the committee are Susan Whelan, the Leicester City chief executive, and Mike Garlick, the Burnley chairman. The non-executive directors Claudia Arney, the interim chairman of the Premier League, and Kevin Beeston are also on the committee.</p>
      <p>Previously the league appointed Susanna Dinnage as its chief executive to succeed Scudamore. The president of Discovery group’s Animal Planet, she withdrew her acceptance of the role in December last year. The following January the Premier League approached Tim Davie, the chief executive of BBC Studios’ commercial division but he decided against taking up the role.</p>
      <p>The Premier League declined to comment on the allegations about Pemsel’s private life.</p>
