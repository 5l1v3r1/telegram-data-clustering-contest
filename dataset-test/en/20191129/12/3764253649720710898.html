      <p>The Association of Nigerian Professionals in Europe (ANPE) on Thursday, November 28, said that the prosecution of the publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, will strengthen Nigeria's democracy.</p>
      <p>The association while deliberating the state of affairs in Nigerian at an emergency meeting in Brussels, Belgium called for the prosecution of Sowore and his co-defendant.</p>
      <p>A communique signed by the association's president, Agwu Onyeke and 13 others, said ANPE frowns at the call for a revolution by Sowore.</p>
      <p>ANPE said such a call by the online publisher and activist is an indication and an aim by Sowore to instigate violence and truncate Nigeria's democracy.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The group further recommended the process of profiling all Sowore's accomplices in Nigeria and beyond the shores - bringing them to justice with the assistance of the International Criminal Court and the Interpol.</p>
      <p>According to ANPE, the unity of Nigeria has been gravely affected by the actions of Sowore and his associates who were allegedly bent on seeing to the disintegration of Nigeria.</p>
      <p><i>"The Association of Nigerian Professionals in Europe also frowns at the campaign of calumny against the government of Nigeria and wishes to state that the campaign is in poor taste aimed at causing disaffection in the polity so they can ultimately rubbish the gains Nigeria has made since 2015 under the present dispensation," </i>the association said.</p>
      <p>The association further resolved that relevant authorities in Nigeria should not relent in its fight against enemies of the country who are engaged in these nefarious acts.</p>
      <p>It also resolved; <i>"That the call for a revolution is a part of a bigger plot towards ensuring that Nigeria is made ungovernable and uninhabitable."</i></p>
