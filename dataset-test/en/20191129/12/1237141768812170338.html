      <p>Roger Federer is taking his winning expertise from the tennis court to the world of shoe design.</p>
      <p>A partnership between the 20-time Grand Slam tennis champion and the founders of On, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a22739511/best-on-running-shoes/">the Swiss running shoe brand</a>, was <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.on-running.com%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2Fwelcome-to-on-roger-federer-refresh&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa30026666%2Froger-federer-joins-on-as-an-investor%2F"><u>announced</u></a> by the company on November 23.</p>
      <p>Federer is joining the team as an investor, contributing product designer, and representative for the Zurich-based brand that has become known for its innovative technology designed to make running feel great.</p>
      <p>“He will use his unique experience to help take our product development, marketing, and fan experiences to new levels,” On announced in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.on-running.com%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2Fwelcome-to-on-roger-federer-refresh&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa30026666%2Froger-federer-joins-on-as-an-investor%2F"><u>release</u></a>. “Roger will also play a role in developing the athlete spirit that’s at the core of our high-performing culture.”</p>

      <p>Founded by duathlon and Ironman champion Olivier Bernhard, David Allemann, and Caspar Coppetti, On burst onto the running scene in 2010. The goal was to engineer a better running shoe that delivered a soft landing and firm takeoff, which led to the creation of <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a22739511/best-on-running-shoes/"><u>CloudTec</u></a>–the company’s patented cushioning construction and famously funky outsoles.</p>
      <p>On also boasts a stacked <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.on-running.com%2Fen-us%2Fathletes&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa30026666%2Froger-federer-joins-on-as-an-investor%2F"><u>elite athlete team</u></a>, which includes five-time ITU world champion Javier Gomez and two-time Olympic triathlon medalist Nicola Spirig, among other endurance sport standouts.</p>
      <p>According to an interview with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/style/roger-federer-on-running-sneaker-deal.html"><i><u>The New York Times</u></i></a>, Federer, 38, “thought that they [On shoes] were a little strange to look at” at first, but soon realized that he admired the design that was worn by so many in his native Switzerland. In his preparation for competition on the court, he began wearing On shoes for his sprint training.</p>
      <p>When the On team noticed Federer wearing the brand’s shoes during his travels around the world, they reached out to him for a meeting over dinner two years ago. From that point on, a relationship began to build between the Swiss athlete and the Swiss company.</p>
      <p>“Roger brings unique insight as one of the most influential and admired athletes at the top of world sport,” the release said. “Together, we are looking to create unique products and experiences for On fans around the world.”</p>
      <p>Despite nearing 40, Federer <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2019/11/25/roger-federer-says-hes-wide-open-to-playing-beyond-2020-why-not/#4b9b50ff5d37"><u>hasn’t ruled out playing beyond 2020</u></a> with goals that include returning to the Olympics after missing 2016 because of a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Federer will end 2019 as the No. 3 player in the world behind Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. He secured his 103rd career title at his hometown Swiss Opener in October and just completed an exhibition tour of North and South America.</p>
      <p>In addition to brand building and global marketing, Federer told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/style/roger-federer-on-running-sneaker-deal.html"><i><u>The New York Times</u></i></a> that he’s looking forward to big picture responsibilities. “I think I can motivate employees from a leadership perspective too, on how to stay humble but dream big,” he said.</p>
      <p>Running and tennis fans can look forward to Federer-designed products to be released in 2020.</p>
