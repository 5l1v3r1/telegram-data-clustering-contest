      <p>If the recent reports are anything to go by, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/hollywood/hollywood_news/shocking-miley-cyrus-has-been-sent-off-to-rehab-reports/5ddea0636608a427896976dc">Miley Cyrus had been recently sent off to rehab </a>and her disappearance from all the social media networks has only added fuel to the fire. Reportedly, Miley has been moving towards the unwanted territory with her crazy behaviour and that has given rise to concerns among her loved ones. As a result of the same, the singer has been moved to rehab to undergo healing and some inner-peace. Now, it looks like her boyfriend Cody Simpson is feeling void, at least that’s what his latest Insta story hints at.</p>
      <p>Cody shared a verse from American playwright Tennessee Williams’ writing that talks about withdrawing from the world and reading journals of dead writers because they are the ones who won’t be expecting any answers from him in return. “I will read long books and the journals of dead writers. I will feel closer to them than I ever felt to people I used to know before I withdrew from the world. It will be sweet and cool this friendship of mine with dead poets, for I won't have to touch them or answer their questions. They will talk to me and not expect me to answer. And I will get sleepy listening to their voices explaining the mysteries to me. I'll fall asleep with the book still in my fingers, and it will rain,” read his post.</p>
