      <p>How was the experience of attending IFFI 2019?</p>
      <p>It's been an amazing experience. I came here to learn and witness everything. I will take something back home.</p>
      <p>Was this your first time at a film festival?</p>
      <p>This was the first time. I did not really know how things happen and what to talk about but it was comfortable. I think, I will come back here next year.</p>
      <p>How do you deal with trolls who say nasty things about you?</p>
      <p>I am still a baby at it and take in everything. I was talking to Nithya Menen and she said that 'it will pass' so it will pass. A lot of my co-stars have also told me 'bro it'll pass' so I am waiting for it to pass.</p>
      <p>But you hit back...</p>
      <p>After a long time, we have found our voice. Now, I have the confidence to react if someone says something about my personal life. Initially, I thought people need to know all of me but then I think the more mystery there is, the more fun it is.</p>
      <p>What kind of roles do you look forward to doing?</p>
      <p>I want roles which make me go 'dude, I did this!' Till now, I was learning but now I think I have learnt quite a bit and need to be like 'this is what I want to give'.</p>
      <p>Are there any directors or actors you look forward to working with?</p>
      <p>It is the films that I look forward to. I want to be a part of the stories directors create.</p>
      <p>How do you prepare for your roles?</p>
      <p>I love it when the team takes me in and make me feel like a family. I have been a part of two such films in my career.</p>
      <h3>Which were these films?</h3>
      <p>I can't reveal. Don't try to get names out of me as I have learnt my lesson.</p>
      <h3>Who are the actresses you look up to?</h3>
      <p>Again, I am not going to bring up names. However, I just watched a movie and told my manager 'that is bloody brilliant! Why am I not doing that?'</p>
      <h3>Any message for our FilmiBeat users?</h3>
      <p>I watch FilmiBeat updates myself, so I am one of you.</p>
