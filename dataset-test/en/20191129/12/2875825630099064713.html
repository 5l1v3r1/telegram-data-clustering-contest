      <p>Irish people had significantly more disposable income last year compared to 2017, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/central-statistics-office">Central Statistics Office</a> figures state.</p>
      <p>The Survey on Income And Living Conditions In <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ireland">Ireland</a> found the average equivalised disposable income was €22,872, an increase of 9.6% on the €20,869 of two years ago.</p>
      <p>Equivalised income is a measure of household money that takes into account the differences in the size and make-up of a home.</p>
      <p>Figures for last year also showed a slight decrease in the number of people who are “at risk of poverty”.</p>
      <p>This rate, which measures the number of people whose income was less than 60% of the national median equivalised income, was 14.0% last year compared to 15.7% in 2017.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/renting">Renters</a> were found to be more likely to be notably suffering financially as a result of moving out.</p>
      <p>An analysis of consistent poverty rates showed the rate for those living in “owned” dwellings was 2.5% compared with 11.2% for those renting at the market rate and 14.2% for those paying less than this or living rent free.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact Irish people have more money in their pockets, the figures show some are still deprived of certain luxuries.</p>
