        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Students and members of civil society in 40 cities across Pakistan are taking part in a Students Solidarity March on Friday demanding the revocation of a 35-year-old ban on students’ unions. Students are fighting to reclaim their right to practice diplomacy, debate, politics, and leadership.</b>

      <p>Against the backdrop of the Solidarity March, Pakistan's government has come out in support of students. Pakistan's Science and Technology Minister Chaudhry <a href="https://twitter.com/fawadchaudhry/status/1200300827719733248">Fawad Hussain said in a tweet</a>: “I fully support restoration of students unions, ban on students unions is anti-democratic, we can always ensure that students’ politics must remain violence free and regulations may be introduced for smooth functioning but ban on students politics amounts to limit future politics".</p>
      <p>Students have been raising a host of issues including the involvement of the army in politics and repealing a ban on campus politics. From being able to question the authorities for better facilities in campuses to inculcating decision-making skills among future leaders, these are just a few reasons stated regarding the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911281077427071-pakistani-student-leader-on-eve-of-studentssolidaritymarch-give-us-right-to-question-authorities/">importance of unions</a> by students.</p>

      <p>​Student unions and campus politics were outlawed in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077305730-anti-imran-protest-intensifies-in-pakistan-as-cleric-led-party-launches-countrywide-blockade/">Pakistan</a> in 1984 by former president General Zia-ul-Haq, and now, 35 years later, they are protesting against the ban.</p>
      <p>Friday’s Solidarity March has been described as a first steps towards a larger agitation by activists. Ever since the beginning of talks about a Solidarity March, universities stopped stopped handing out degrees for the organisers and the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911031077212432-security-beefed-up-in-islamabad-to-prevent-muslim-cleric-led-march-seeking-imran-khans-resignation/">government</a> even issued letters to the universities about the ban on campus politics. </p>
