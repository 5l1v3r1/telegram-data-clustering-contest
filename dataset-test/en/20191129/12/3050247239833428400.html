      <h1>Here’s Where to Spend Crypto Online This Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:06:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Aubrey Hansen</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday is an unofficial “shopping holiday” that traditionally takes place the day after Thanksgiving Day in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa">United States</a>. While the tradition originated in the U.S., it has since spread to all corners of the Earth and always takes place on the fourth Friday of November.</p>
      <p>The event involves retailers across the country slashing prices on a variety of goods in a bid to kickstart the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/christmas">Christmas</a> shopping season. Due to the multitude of discounts on offer, the day has become the busiest shopping day in the United States, with many stores opening at midnight and facing hordes of shoppers. </p>
      <p>The term is believed to have originated in Philadelphia to describe the heavy road traffic experienced on the day but has since been co-opted to mean the day when retailers turn a profit and go from being “in the red” to “in the black.”</p>
      <h3>Crypto and Black Friday</h3>
      <p>Over the past few years, the tradition of Black Friday has found its way into the cryptocurrency industry, with several retailers and blockchain businesses putting on special discounts and accepting crypto payments.</p>
      <p>One of the earliest crypto-related Black Friday events was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-black-friday">Bitcoin Black Friday</a>, which ran six successful events over seven years before recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-black-friday-shuts-forever-as-founder-says-mission-complete">coming to an end</a>. Event organizer Jon Holmquist feels he has completed his “mission” with the event, but is open to someone else taking it over. However, many other crypto-related Black Friday events and specials continue as usual.</p>
      <p>Major crypto hardware wallet suppliers <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/trezor">Trezor</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ledger">Ledger</a> have historically held annual Black Friday specials, with the Ledger Nano S selling for half price last year. Several <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> and trading platforms have also run sales, with Coinigy offering a 75% discount on its annual package, Tradingview giving 60% off on its premium package, and CoinCorner offering £20 worth of Bitcoin to new customers.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday 2019</h3>
      <p>This year’s Black Friday event sees leading crypto exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/binance">Binance</a> doubling its referral reward to $30 for each new registration and Binance.US offering trading fee discounts of up to 75%.</p>
      <p>Hardware wallet providers Trezor and Ledger are offering 30% discounts on certain products until Dec. 3, and Tradingview is again offering 60% off its premium subscriptions. All of the above accept payment in a variety of cryptocurrencies. Similar to last year, cryptos themselves appear to be on sale, with Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) and the majority of altcoins down 15–20% this week. </p>

      <p>Black Friday shoppers in the U.S. will now be able to buy Bitcoin more easily while out shopping thanks to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-atm-firm-partners-with-largest-shopping-mall-operator-in-us">collaboration</a> between Miami-based Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop and leading shopping mall operator Simon Malls. The joint initiative will install Bitcoin ATMs at several locations in California, Florida and Georgia. Bitstop hopes to have 500 of its Bitcoin ATMs installed across the country by the end of next year.</p>
