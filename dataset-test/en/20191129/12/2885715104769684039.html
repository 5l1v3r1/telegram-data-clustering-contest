      <h1>Bharti Airtel to seek board nod on December 4 for raising funds</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:45:18+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Friday said it board will meet on December 4 to consider raising of funds.</p>
      <p>The fund raising proposal follows the Supreme Court judgement on adjusted gross revenue.</p>
      <p>“…a meeting of the board of Directors of the Company is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, December 04, 2019 to, inter-alia, consider and evaluate any and all proposals for raising of funds either by issuance of equity shares, and or bonds including foreign currency convertible bonds,” the company said in a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>The board will also evaluate raising of funds through debentures, non-convertible debt instruments along with warrants, convertible debentures , securities or any other equity based instruments including through qualified institutions placement or rights issue, or through any other permissible mode, the filing said.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court on October 24, 2019, upheld the government’s way of calculating telecom revenue, on which licence fee and spectrum usage charges are computed.</p>
      <p>As per the initial calculations, access players like Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other operational telecom operators may have to pay the government a whopping Rs 1.33 lakh crore within three months.</p>
