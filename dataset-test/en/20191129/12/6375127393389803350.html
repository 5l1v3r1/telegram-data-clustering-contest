        <b>GAMES ‘ZERO INCIDENT’</b>
      </p>
      <p>ALL security preparations are in place to ensure “zero incident” during the 30th SEA Games which will officially start today and end on December 14, Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa said yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Moving forward, a day before the opening of the much awaited 30th SEA Games at the Philippine Arena, the PNP is all set to put our best foot forward and aim to deliver an effective security strategy to guarantee zero incident,” he said.</p>
      <p>As of yesterday, a total of 2,751 delegates with 2,578 SEA Games participants and 173 other foreign delegates have already arrived in the country, said PNP spokesman Brigadier Gen. Bernard M. Banac.</p>
      <p>In Camp Crame, a 500-strong PNP Reactionary Standby Support Force was officially activated and placed on standby for deployment to any areas in case of emergency and other contingencies.</p>
      <p>“No untoward incident was monitored. Moreover, the PNP fully respects the right of citizens to peaceably assemble, and express their sentiments as guaranteed under our constitution and democratic system,” he said amid projected rallies by anti-government groups during the event.</p>
      <p>“We are confident that leaders of militant organizations will express similar gesture of cooperation and discipline in their mass actions. Let me reiterate our unequivocal position that any public assembly outside of the designated Freedom Parks is deemed illegal and will be addressed accordingly. Maximum tolerance will always be exercised by our police,” Banac said.</p>
      <p>The PNP joined the entire nation in expressing its support to Filipino athletes seeing action in the 30th SEA Games.</p>
      <p>“Although the PNP is preoccupied with our duty to keep the SEA Games safe and secure for all participants and spectators, every Filipino officer is cheering for the home team and wish them the blessing of magnanimous victory in this tournament,” Banac said.</p>
      <p>“The Philippines’ hosting of this international sports event opens the country’s doors to our ASEAN neighbors and the global community of free nations for greater opportunities and prospects at sports excellence that every team wants to achieve.</p>
      <p>“By the grace of God, may the thrill of victory come upon Team Pilipinas. Go for Gold,” Banac added.</p>
      <p>With the official games set to begin on Saturday, the PNP spokesperson also called on the public to avoid bringing backpacks and other belongings to SEA Games events to avoid inconvenience in entering sporting venues.</p>
      <p>Banac said that security checks and inspections of bags and other belongings will be strictly undertaken at entrances as part of the high security alert. “Iwanan na lang po natin ang ating mga backpack at iba pang dala-dalang bagay para hindi tayo makaantala sa lahat ng papasok na manonood doon sa entrance para hindi na tayo matagalan sa pagtse-check ng bagahe,” he said.</p>
      <p>Banac likewise advised the public to plan their travel to SEA Games venues, familiarize themselves with the location of restrooms and exits in the sports venues, and be conscious of their own security when attending the international sports events.</p>
      <p>Around 27,000 policemen backed by volunteers and other law enforcement agents will be securing the SEA Games’ opening ceremony at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan which is expected to be graced by President Duterte.</p>
