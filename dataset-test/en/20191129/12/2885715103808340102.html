      <p>Boyega, who plays Stormtrooper turned resistance fighter Finn in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, told US television show Good Morning America that a cleaner had found the script and put it on the eBay auction site.</p>
      <p>Director JJ Abrams said earlier this week that the team behind the film spotted the eBay listing and was able to get it back before it was sold, meaning the secrets in the plot are still safe.</p>

      <p>“I was moving apartments and I left the script under my bed. I was just like, you know what, I’ll leave it under my bed,” Boyega said on Wednesday. “When I wake up in the morning I’ll take it and move, but my boys came over and, you know, we started partying a little bit and then the script just, it just stayed there.”</p>
      <p>“Then a few weeks after a cleaner comes in, finds the script and then puts it on eBay for, like, 65 (British) pounds. So the person didn’t know the true value,” he added.</p>
      <p>Scripts for Star Wars movies are among the most closely guarded in the film world. Many actors only get the parts of the script for their specific scenes and critics do not get to see the film in advance.</p>

      <p>Boyega said that even he did not know the ending of the film, which concludes the Skywalker saga first brought to life in the 1977 original.</p>
