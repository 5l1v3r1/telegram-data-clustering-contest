      <p>Dragon Age. That’s the tweet.</p>
      <p>Bioware’s Mark Darrah – executive producer on the high fantasy RPG Dragon Age franchise – has been continuing his fondness of “making cryptic statements to tease fans” by tweeting the two words “Dragon” and “Age” in that order, for probably no reason at all.</p>

      <p>Is it nonsense? Or are we about to find out information on the next step in the series?</p>
      <p>He seems to be just mucking around for fun, baiting people on Twitter.</p>
      <p>However, five years after Dragon Age Inquisition, there have been stirrings around a new game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw3lrXlti-8">A teaser was released</a> at last year’s Game Awards, and both developer BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts have been pretty open about a new game for quite a while.</p>
      <p>Further to that, it’s exactly a week until EA’s own branded “Dr4gon Age Day,” which occurs on December 4.</p>
      <p>Coincidence? Who knows. All I know is: ‘Dragon Age’</p>
