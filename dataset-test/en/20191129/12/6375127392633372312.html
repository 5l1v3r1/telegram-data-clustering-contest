      <h3>SIX persons -- five men and one woman -- engaging in the manufacturing and selling of fake identification cards for senior citizens and persons with disabiliies (PWDs) were presented to the media by Mayor Isko Moreno following their arrest by the Manila Police District- Special Mayor’s Reaction Team (SMART).</h3>
      <p>Moreno also lauded SMART chief  PMaj. Jhun Ibay, with a warning that such illegal activities definitely have no room in the current city government.</p>
      <p>The mayor also directed Ibay to file the necessary charges against the suspects identified as  Rizaldy Sayana, 35, of Antipolo Street, Tondo, Manila; Carlo Magno, 55, of  Blk. 15,  Lot 15, GRS Malolos, Bulacan; Carlito Ibarra, 53, of 1697 C.M. Recto Avenue, Manila; Chris Alonzo, 27, of  443 C.P Garcia St., Tondo, Manila; Joshua Flores, 22, of  920 Quezon Blvd., Sampaloc, Manila and Angelica Aranda, 24, of  916 Quezon Blvd., Sampaloc, Manila.</p>
      <p>According to Ibay, the arrest came after Moreno ordered an investigation into complaints being received by the office of Re Fugoso, chief of the Manila Department of Social Welfare.</p>
      <p>Fugoso reported that many fake PWD and senior citizens’ IDs have been confiscated while data gathering activities are being done by her office for the distribution of the monthly allowance beginning next year.</p>
      <p>Confiscated during the operation launched by Ibay’s team were fake IDs,  computer sets and ten marked P100 bills used in the entrapment.</p>
      <p>The suspects have been charged with violation of Article 172 (falsification of documents, use of falsified documents) and of Article 176 (manufacture and possession of instrument), both of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
