      <p><b>PHILADELPHIAÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities say a man was shot and critically wounded at a Philadelphia transit station.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred just before midnight Thursday at a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority site where the agency parks its buses.</p>
      <p>Police responding to reports of shots fired found several shell casings there but could not locate the victim, identified only as 19-year-old man. But they soon learned he had gone to a hospital for treatment of multiple gunshot wounds.</p>
      <p>Authorities say the man is expected to survive, but they did not disclose further details on his injuries or his condition.</p>
      <p>A motive for the shooting remains under investigation.</p>
