      <p>The news comes after a day of chaos that saw Aldi customers scrambling to get their hands on the toys when they were released in store yesterday (November 28).</p>
      <p>They had previously sold out online and shoppers were reported to have queued outside stores from 6.30am to try and snap up one of the toys.</p>

      <p>Kevin is the star of bargain supermarket Aldi's Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>Sales of toys sold in store are going to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity.</p>
      <p>Those who missed out on buying the toys – which retail at £19.99 for the giant Kevin plush toy and £11.97 for the Kevin and family bundle – now face a whopping bill if they want to nab one.</p>

      <p>One seller was selling a giant Kevin for a buy it now price of £1,000.</p>
      <p>An Aldi spokesperson said: "Aldi has received reports of queues and products are expected to sell out within hours in certain stores, leading to some customers being unable to get their hands on a Kevin toy."</p>
      <p>Indeed, shoppers took to Twitter to vent their frustration, calling those who are selling the toys for profit "disgusting".</p>
