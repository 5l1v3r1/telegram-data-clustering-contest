      <p>Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, the sole woman involved in the murder of a man at Orchard Towers is disputing and claiming trial to one of her charges.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is claiming trial to the charge of consorting with a co-accused who had in his possession a Kerambit knife.</p>
      <p>Her defence lawyer Amarick Gill has said that Siow has not decided if she would plead guilty or claim trial to her remaining two charges.</p>
      <p>While she has had her murder charge reduced to voluntarily causing hurt, she was also charged with one count of consorting with co-accused Tan Sen Yang, 28, who allegedly had an offensive weapon in his possession on the day of the incident at Orchard Towers.</p>

      <p>She was also handed a charge of behaving in a disorderly manner that morning on July 2. According to the charge sheet, she repeatedly dashed towards a group of patrons at the main entrance of Naughty Girl Club trying to kick and push them.</p>
      <p>Three of Siow’s co-accused in remand still face the death penalty: Tan Sen Yang, 28, and Ang Da Yuan and Joel Tan Yun Sheng, both 26.</p>
      <p>In October, Siow could not hold back her tears upon hearing that the charge of murder against her had been reduced to assault.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Siow was initially charged with the murder of Mr Satheesh, along with Tan Hong Sheng, 22; Loo Boon Chong, 25; Tan Sen Yang, 28; and Joel Tan Yun Sheng, Chan Jia Xing and Ang Da Yuan, all of whom are 26 years old.</p>
      <p>They allegedly killed 31-year old Satheesh Noel Gobidass.</p>
      <p>On the day of the incident, the victim collapsed near an escalator in the building and was found lying motionless in a pool of blood. Members of the public attended to his injuries.</p>
      <p>The police were alerted at 6.25 am, and the victim was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital unconscious and pronounced dead an hour later.<br/>If convicted, she could be jailed for up to three years for knowingly consorting with a person in possession of a dangerous weapon.</p>
      <p>For disorderly behaviour in a public place, she could be jailed for up to six months, fined S$2,000, or both, if she is a first-time offender.</p>
      <p>As for the reduced charge she faces for voluntarily causing hurt with a common intention, she also faces up to two years’ jail, a S$5,000 fine, or both.</p>
      <p>A pre-trial conference for her case has been fixed on Jan. 6, 2020. /TISG</p>
