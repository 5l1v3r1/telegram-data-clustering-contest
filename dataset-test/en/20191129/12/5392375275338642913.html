Unfortunately, there are no news from the company regarding the launch date. However, the Chinese Behemoth has just added the ‘Notify me’ button on its <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/in/wearables/watch-gt2/">official Indian site</a>. It confirms that the smartwatch will be sold in the country through Amazon.in and Flipkart.</p>
      <p>Huawei Watch GT 2 boasts Kirin A1 SoC and will come in two sizes – 42mm and 46mm. The former will be available in Night Black shade while the latter will have three color options to choose from – Matte Black, Pebble Brown, and Titanium Grey.</p>

      <p>If you’re going for the smaller version you’ll get a 1.2-inch AMOLED display with 390×390 pixel resolution. The larger model, however, features a 1.39-inch AMOLED screen of 454×454 pixel resolution. The smaller model also has 16MB of RAM, 4GB storage and a 215mAh battery. As you may expect, the larger sibling has space for better specs. Therefore, it comes with 32MB of RAM and a 455mAh battery, unfortunately, it features the same 4GB storage.</p>
      <p>The Watch GT 2 boasts Bluetooth 5.1, GPS, 50-meter water resistance, heart rate monitoring and fitness tracking. The bigger version also comes with Bluetooth calling. For now, we must wait for more news regarding the price adopted by the company in India.</p>
