      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Nollywood</a> screen diva, Tonto Dikeh is in the news again after saying she is ready to pay groom price and sponsor the wedding when she finds another man.</p>
      <p>She made this known in a comment section on Instagram, when a follower asked her to get married that she is aging already.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> reports that Tonto had shared a photo, narrating how her past mistakes made her a man.</p>
      <p>She wrote “I’M THANKFUL FOR ALL MY MISTAKES/FAILURES. THEY ARE THE EVIDENCE THAT PROVES I TRIED. I’ve learned more from failure than I have success. It’s the training ground that’s preparing me for where I’m going. I no longer fear it. Instead, it gets me closer to the GOAL. Without it, I wouldn’t be the MAN I am today.”</p>
      <p>Reacting, the follower identified as @Mmadubiafra said “the beauty of a woman is her husband. No Woman is complete without her husband go and marry you are getting old”</p>
      <p>In her response, the mother of one said when she finds another man, she will pay groom price.</p>
      <p>Tonto said “When I find another man I am willing to pay his groom price and sponsor his wedding I will.. OLODO NI”</p>
      <p>The actress has for some weeks now been in the news for different reasons ranging from her alleged deportation from Dubai, seizure of her international passport and her <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/25/shocking-revelations-as-tonto-dikeh-blogger-clash-on-instagram/">war of words with popular blogger, Stella Dimokokorkus.</a></p>
