      <h2>Drivers are being warned they could face delays this weekend as carriageway resurfacing improvements get under way on a busy stretch of dual carriageway between Perth and Dundee.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:16:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/jbuchan/" target="_blank">Jamie Buchan</a></address>
      <p>The works will take place on the A90 northbound between Barnhill and Kinfauns.</p>
      <p>Surfacing repairs are being carried out across a number of sections and improvements are being made to road markings.</p>
      <p>Crews will work round the clock to complete the programme.</p>
      <p>A contraflow system will be in place on the M90 and A90 between Perth and Kinfauns to ensure the safety of road workers and users.</p>
      <p>BEAR Scotland’s North East representative Andy Thompson said: “These surfacing improvements will help create a safer and smoother road surface on this section of the A90 and will ensure our network continues to operate at the highest standard.</p>
      <p>“The traffic management is essential to ensure the safety of road workers and motorists during this project.</p>
      <p>“To help minimise delays as much as possible, we have planned the improvements to take place over one weekend using 24-hour working.</p>
      <p>“Our teams will do all that they can to complete this project as quickly and safely as possible.”</p>
      <p>Mr Thompson said the company wanted to thank drivers in advance for their patience while the repairs are carried out.</p>
      <p>The works are scheduled to begin this evening from 7.30pm.</p>
      <p>They are expected to be completed by 6.30am on Monday.</p>
