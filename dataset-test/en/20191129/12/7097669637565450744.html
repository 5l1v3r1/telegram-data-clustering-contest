      <h1>Russia Should Fear What France Will Do to Protect Its Satellites</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T12:30:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Michael Peck</a></address>
      <p><b>Key Point:</b> France's capabilities even verge into the area of offense against other satelittes. </p>
      <p>France is arming its orbital satellites with lasers and machine guns.</p>
      <p>“If our satellites are threatened, we envisage blinding those of our enemies,” said Defense Minister Florence Parly. “We will judge the moment and the means of retaliation, but it could mean the use of powerful lasers deployed from our satellites or from patrolling nano-satellites.”</p>
      <p>“The next generation of Syracuse [military communications] satellites will be equipped with cameras that will allow them to identify possible attackers,” according to the <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lepoint.fr%2Fsociete%2Fespace-la-france-va-armer-ses-prochains-satellites-militaires-25-07-2019-2326872_23.php">French newspaper <i>Le Point</i></a>. “But, in a second time, the satellites of the following generations will be equipped with weapons allowing them to fight back. This can be achieved by machine guns capable of destroying the aggressor's solar panels or by lasers to blind or destroy an enemy satellite.”</p>
      <p>The news follows French president Emmanuel Macron’s announcement last month that the French military would create a space command, similar to U.S. Space Command created by U.S. president Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>While Parly didn’t specifically mention Russia as the impetus for armed satellites, she “has made clear that the threat against Western targets is not theoretical,” noted the <i>Financial Times</i>. “Last year she publicly accused Russia of spying when it maneuvered a satellite to eavesdrop on a Franco-Italian military communications satellite called Athena-Fidus in 2017. ‘We are watching it closely, and we saw that it continued to maneuver actively around other targets in the months that followed,’ she said then. ‘But who can say it won’t come back towards one of our satellites tomorrow?’”</p>
      <p>France is an odd player in the space game. While a middleweight in conventional military power and with a small force of submarine-launched nuclear missiles, France has the biggest space program in Europe. Ariane rockets have proven formidable competitors to U.S. companies in the commercial launch market. Should Europe ever join the United States, Russia and China as a major player in militarizing space, France would play a leading role.</p>
