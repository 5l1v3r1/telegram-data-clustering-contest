      <p>A terminally ill <i>Star Wars</i> fan had one of his dying wishes granted by Disney CEO Bob Iger, who granted him and his son an early screening of <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">The Rise of Skywalker</a></i>.</p>
      <p>The fan, whose name has not been released, is a patient at the U.K.-based Rowans Hospice in Waterlooville, Hampshire, and his situation was brought to Iger's attention by the facility via Twitter on Nov. 26. Iger then responded by requesting "the necessary details" and said, "we will certainly try."</p>

      <p>According to the hospice, "a very nice man named Jonathan from Disney turned up at our Hospice with a laptop that had a very important movie on it. Our amazing patient has now seen #StarWars #RiseofSkywalker with his son."</p>

      <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dcU8E-iIul77x6f989cECH6qMFSmzBw5/view">Rowans</a> later released the following statement on behalf of the patient: "I just want to say the biggest thank you to everyone that has helped to make this happen. During what is just a horrible situation to be in, you have helped to make some wonderful memories and bring some joy to my family. I am a huge Star Wars fan and what I am going through is completely dire. Then to top it all, I thought I wasn’t going to see the film I have been waiting to see since 1977! I still can’t believe it. The only way I can describe this to you is to say that this must be what it feels like to be told you have won a million pounds!"</p>
      <p>"We are truly humbled by everyone’s support," the patient's wife added. "What has happened over the past few days has been truly mind-blowing. From a simple conversation, to witnessing the out pouring of generosity has been amazing. The massive Star Wars community has been incredible. The amazing people who have visited, along with the messages and gifts we have received have provided us with an opportunity to talk to our son more about the reality of his Dad’s condition."</p>
