      <h3>Explore Dublin and Ireland</h3>
      <p>Dublin offers a litany of things to do and see, as well as the perfect place to begin your Irish adventure. While you’re in the city you’ll be privy to a number of fantastic eateries, shopping, and, of course, its famous pubs. If you are looking to venture outside of the city, however, you’ll be able to explore the stunning beauty of the countryside.</p>
      <p>For example, the stunning Cliffs of Moher, Ireland’s most visited tourist attraction, are located three hours from the city. These spectacular cliffs rise an incredible 702 feet at their highest point, just north of O’Brien’s Tower. These majestic rock faces are an awe-inspiring sights to behold, and many people spend half of their day viewing them in all of their rugged glory.</p>
