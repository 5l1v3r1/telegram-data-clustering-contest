      <h1>Fabinho: Liverpool midfielder out injured for up to eight weeks with ankle ligament damage</h1>
      <h2>The Brazilian hobbled off against Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a>’s Premier League and European ambitions have been dealt a considerable blow with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fabinho">Fabinho</a> facing six to eight weeks on the sidelines after sustaining ankle ligament damage. </p>
      <p>The holding midfielder, who has been one of the club’s standout stars in 2019, does not require surgery to rectify the injury picked up during the 1-1 Champions League draw with Napoli on Wednesday night. </p>
      <p>Jürgen Klopp was apprehensive rather than optimistic in his post-match assessment of Fabinho’s situation after the awkward collision with Hirving Lozano on 14 minutes and scans have confirmed his fears. </p>
      <p>The Brazil international had departed Anfield on crutches with his left ankle in a protective boot.</p>
      <p>The setback comes at the worst possible time for Liverpool given their packed December schedule, which includes a Merseyside derby, needing to secure qualification to the knockout stages of the Champions League at Red Bull Salzburg, the Club World Cup in Qatar and a difficult test at Leicester City. </p>
      <p>The mooted rehabilitation period would also make Fabinho doubtful for the away trip to Tottenham on January 11, which is followed by the hosting of Manchester United the following weekend.</p>
