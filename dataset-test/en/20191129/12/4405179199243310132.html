      <h2>Cyber Monday is the time to bag yourself a fantastic VPN deal. A VPN offers additional privacy and security on the web, but also allows you to access content that might be geographically restricted.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-12-02T09:41:00+00:00">02 Dec 2019, 09:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/somrata-sarkar/" target="_blank">Somrata Sarkar</a></address>
      <p>VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, grant stronger online privacy by hiding your real location online. It's especially useful if you want to protect your identity on a shared Wi-Fi network. With your IP address hidden, VPNs also allow you to browse content that might be blocked in your country.</p>
      <p>You may for instance, want to watch the BBC iPlayer outside the UK, or access Netflix UK while on holiday in the US (though this may violate the terms and conditions of the streaming platform, so watch out).</p>
      <p>There are lots of different services competing for your attention and now, on Cyber Monday, the hottest offers are available. Already great discounts are being bolstered by extra offers of free months tagged onto the end of your subscription, so now is an excellent time to try one out.</p>
      <p>For example, <a href="https://billing.purevpn.com/aff.php?aff=25344&amp;data1=41-3776523-11-0000000">PureVPN Cyber Monday deal gets you a massive 88% off</a>.</p>

      <h3>How to find the best VPN deal for Mac</h3>
      <p>VPN subscriptions are usually bundled into two or three-year periods, though you can often choose to pay as you go month-by-month as well. Typically, longer subscription commitments reduce the monthly rate, saving you overall. Prices rarely exceed £6/US$7 per month with multi-year subscriptions.</p>
      <p>Many major VPN providers offer discounts through the year, and sometimes even offer permanent discounts. These discounts can look impressive at first. It's not uncommon to see a blaring "70% off" sign and an ever-receding count down ticking to when the deal ends – but such deals may be regular.</p>
      <p>Of course even with year-round discounts, the percentage off can (and do) fluctuate – in which case it's possible you can pick up a better deal at certain times over others. Yet large discounts aren't too surprising. This makes it all the more important to look into the various providers and what each has to offer, before jumping into a long term commitment.</p>
      <p>As with most tech and software, we'd recommend looking for seasonal discounts. With Halloween due at the end of the month, you might find VPN services offering more money off than usual. Apart from Halloween,<b> <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/black-friday-apple-deals-3664699/">Black Friday</a></b> and – you guessed it – <b><a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/cyber-monday-apple-deals-3679174/">Cyber Monday</a></b> are pivotal sales seasons to look out for.</p>
      <p>Right now <a href="https://billing.purevpn.com/aff.php?aff=25344&amp;data1=41-3776523-11-0000000">PureVPN has a <b>special</b></a> that reduces its price to $1.65 per month for a five-year subscription. Its usual rate is $10.95 per month. PureVPN currently holds the number 3 spot in our round up of the <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/best-mac-vpn-3642209/">best VPNs for Mac</a>.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, not all VPNs are created equal. Some services are better in some respects than others. For instance, PureVPN offers the most countries and NordVPN offers the most servers, while others, like Surfshark and Cyberghost allow <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3776523-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fsecurity%2Fbest-vpn-deals-for-mac-3776523%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Finternet%2Fbest-streaming-vpn-3674177%2F">better streaming</a>.</p>
      <p>Many VPNs like NordVPN offer cross-device coverage too, so you can use it on your Mac, iPhone or iPad. We've separately rounded up the <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iosapps/best-vpn-for-iphone-3651552/">best iPhone VPNs</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/ipad/best-vpn-for-ipad-3676799/">iPad VPNs</a> so be sure to check those out too.</p>
