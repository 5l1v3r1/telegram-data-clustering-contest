      </p>
      <p>Communication issues are plaguing Kelowna General Hospital Friday morning.</p>
      <p>A release from Interior Health indicates "phone lines to Kelowna General Hospital and some other Interior Health sites in the Okanagan are currently down."</p>
      <p>Interior Health say it is working closely with Telus to address the issue as quickly as possible. IH says services at KGH and other sites have not been impacted, but people may not be able to get through on the phone lines until the issue is remedied.</p>
      <p>Anyone with emergency health care needs should call 911 or go to the emergency department.</p>
