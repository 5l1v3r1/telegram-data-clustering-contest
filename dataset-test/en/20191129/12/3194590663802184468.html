        <b>Kate Henshaw, Nollywood actress, has called out women who subject their children to skin lightening procedures with the intention of glowing their skins.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the past few days, clips of female adults undergoing a skin treatment procedure, which see them get submerged in a bathtub full of steaming water with the intent of removing the outer layer of their skin, have been making the rounds on social media.</p>
      <p>But on Thursday, the 48-year-old mother of one took to her social media account to reprimand mothers who administer skin bleaching cosmetics on their babies or make them undergo these treatments and questioned their motive for such actions.</p>
      <p>“You do not bleach babies! There is nothing to glow in their bodies! You can boil any adult who submit themselves to you but, for goodness sake, leave babies out of this madness. This is where I draw the line!” she wrote.</p>
      <p>“Selling all sorts of unverified products to mothers telling them to glow their babies with a flawless shower bath! What is this self-loathing that you want to transfer to children? For 20k or 30k you want to destroy a future for aesthetic value?”</p>

      <p>Henshaw, who recently featured in ‘<b><a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/kate-henshaw-plays-inspector-in-ego-boyos-the-ghost-and-house-of-truth/">Ghost and House of Truth</a></b>‘, had earlier cried out that there’s a form of “sick pleasure derived from seeing people suffer” in Nigeria after her “nerve-racking” airport experience in the country.</p>
