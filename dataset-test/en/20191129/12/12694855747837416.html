        <b>Sky is still tops when it comes to equipping your home with the most complete entertainment</b>
        <b> package – and with Black Friday 2019 now in full swing in the UK, you can save over £500 on its ultimate TV bundle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pay-TV provider is getting busy for Black Friday again this year, dropping prices on a wide range of its TV packages, with offerings that will appeal to sports fans, movie buffs, and families.</p>
      <p>The best of the bunch, to our eye, is its Black Friday Mega Bundle, which includes pretty much everything Sky has to offer for just over £53.50 – a sizeable saving of £31.50 a month that equates to a gigantic £567 over the course of the 18-month contract.</p>
      <p>We continually check thousands of prices to show you the best deals. If you buy a product through our site we will earn a small commission from the retailer – a sort of automated referral fee – but our reviewers are always kept separate from this process. You can read more about how we make money in our <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/info/trusted-reviews-ethics-policy-3521647#how-we-make-money">Ethics Policy.</a></p>
      <p>To get started, you’ll need to sign up for a Sky Entertainment package, which costs £22 a month and bags you over 300 live Sky TV channels and 40 catch-up channels – including Sky Atlantic – as well as its top-of-the-line Sky Q box.</p>
      <p>There’s a one-off setup charge of £20, but with that as your baseline, you can then customise your Sky bundle with one of its amazing value <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/tv-deals-black-friday-3938829">Black Friday TV deals</a> and add the likes of Sky Sports, Sky Cinema, Sky Kids and more.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can build your own packaging by picking and choosing your favourite parts of the Mega Bundle – get everything Sky Sports has to offer for just £15 a month this Black Friday, or the latest films with Sky Cinema for a mere £5.50 extra a month.</p>

      <p>We think Sky Q is pretty the best TV, giving it a nearly perfect 4.5/5 star review score and calling it the “ultimate TV viewing solution…TV the way it should be done.”</p>
      <p>This is one of the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-28-11-3958979">best Black Friday 2019 deals</a> we’ve seen today, but you’ll want to act fast, as Sky hasn’t revealed how long its sale will be lasting this year and the wider shopping event officially ends at midnight tonight.</p>
