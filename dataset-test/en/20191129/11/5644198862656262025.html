      <p>SINGAPORE: Veteran actor Ng Aik Leong, better known as Huang Yiliang, was charged on Friday (Nov 29) over attacking a man with a metal scraper and hitting another man with his phone.</p>

      <p>He is accused of voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon of offence, by hitting a man named Jahidul on his abdomen and head with a metal scraper at the canteen of the Singapore Islamic Hub.</p>
      <p>This allegedly occurred at about 4.30pm on Dec 11, 2018.</p>
      <p>Mr Jahidul was left with a 2cm-long blood clot over his scalp, a 10cm mark over his abdomen and an abrasion, the charge sheets stated.</p>
      <p>Ng is also accused of disturbing the public peace at about 7.50pm on Jun 9 this year at 662 Buffalo Road, by fighting with a Mogana Raj Saravanan.</p>
      <p>He allegedly struck the man on the back of his head with his mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Speaking through a Mandarin interpreter, Ng asked for an adjournment to engage counsel, and the judge granted one to Dec 20.</p>
      <p>If found guilty of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon, Ng could be jailed for up to seven years, fined, or both. He cannot be caned as he is over 50.</p>
      <p>If convicted of affray, he could be jailed for up to a year, fined a maximum S$5,000, or both.</p>
      <p>Ng was an actor with Mediacorp from the 1980s, known for his roles in Channel 8 television serials including Holland V and Double Happiness.</p>
      <p>He has left the local industry for more than a decade, but was credited in shows produced in China as recently as 2014.</p>
      <p>He was previously married to fellow artiste Lin Meijiao, but the pair divorced in the late 1990s.</p>
