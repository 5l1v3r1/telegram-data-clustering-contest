      <p>DAYTON — A local Air Force reservist is facing a fight based on principle here at home.</p>
      <p>She’s working to get paid for vacation time that she earned with the City of Dayton but couldn’ t use because of her service in the armed forces.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Godsey says she’s serving out a dream in the Air Force.</p>
      <p>“I'm with the 445th Airlift Wing out at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,” she said. “It’s just an honor to represent our nation that way.”</p>
      <p>But what she isn’t thrilled with is the dispute she’s in with the City of Dayton.</p>
      <p>Godsey retired in August after serving 24 years as a Dayton police officer.</p>
      <p>But last year, she was with the police department when she was deployed with her reserve unit to Kuwait.</p>
      <p>“I had excess vacation time as a result of my deployment that I was not able to use,” Godsey said. “That excess was 16 days.”</p>
      <p>So she filed a request to have the 16 days paid out.</p>
      <p>Documentation and emails Godsey provided to News Center 7’s I-Team show the police department approved the request, but the city’s human resources department denied it.</p>
      <p>So she filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Right Act (USERRA).</p>
      <p>“They found that there was merit in the complaint that I filed and there was wrongdoing on the city’s part for taking those days as a result of my military service,” Godsey said.</p>
      <p>The feds recommended the city pay Godsey for the full 16 days based on the USERRA complaint, but Dayton only paid her for seven.</p>
      <p>News Center 7 I-Team reporter John Bedell reached out to the City of Dayton and asked the city to explain its decision.</p>
      <p>They responded with the following statement: “The City of Dayton will not comment on this matter due to ongoing litigation.”</p>
      <p>Godsey told the I-Team her next step it to talk with the Department of Justice — which may lead to civil action against the city.</p>
      <p>“If this is not resolved, that is absolutely what I intend to do,” she said.</p>
      <p>This isn’t about the money for Godsey.</p>
      <p>She knows there are plenty of other city employees who are in the military.</p>
      <p>She’s continuing this fight so it doesn’t become someone else’ battle.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a matter of principle,” Godsey said. “And right is right and wrong is wrong. And that was vacation time that I had accrued and earned over the 24 years that I worked for the City of Dayton and it was turned around and taken away while I was serving my country.”</p>
