      <p>A South African court on Friday rejected an appeal by former President Jacob Zuma that sought to prevent his prosecution on corruption charges over a 2 billion dollars arms deal.</p>
      <p>The ruling paves the way for Zuma’s long-awaited trial to start in Feb. 2020.</p>
      <p>Zuma, in office from 2009 to 2018, had previously applied for a permanent stay of prosecution on 18 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to an arms deal with French defense firm Thales in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>In mid-October, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed an application by Zuma and Thales for a permanent stay of prosecution.</p>

      <p>Zuma appealed against it, but on Friday the court struck out his appeal.</p>
      <p>Zuma is accused of accepting 500,000 rand (34,000 dollars) annually from Thales in 1999, in exchange for protecting the company from an investigation into the deal.</p>
      <p>He rejects the allegations as a politically motivated “witch-hunt” against him.</p>
      <p>Thales, known as Thompson-CSF in 1999, has said it had no knowledge of any transgressions by any of its employees in relation to the awarding of the contracts.</p>
      <p>The National Prosecuting Authority initially filed the charges against Zuma a decade ago, but set them aside shortly before Zuma successfully ran for president in 2009.</p>
      <p>Following appeals and lobbying by opposition parties, the NPA reinstated the charges in March 2018.</p>
