      <p>Costco is extending its Thanksgiving Day online promotions to customers in the US after its website crashed for several hours and shoppers were unable to shop the sales.</p>
      <p>Reports of its site issues first surfaced on Twitter on Thursday morning. By midmorning, the retailer, whose stores were closed in the US over Thanksgiving Day, added a banner to its website warning online shoppers that the site was "experiencing slow response times."</p>
      <p>An updated banner now informs shoppers that the sales have been extended throughout Black Friday, "while supplies last."</p>
      <p>It is not clear how much these website interruptions may have cost Costco. A company representative was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.</p>
      <p>But judging by the flurry of complaints that cropped up on Twitter throughout the day, it seems a good chunk of people were affected:</p>
