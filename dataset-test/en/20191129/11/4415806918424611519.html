      <p>Terry Jones is still laughing through his dementia, fellow Monty Python star Sir Michael Palin has said – but at his own jokes.</p>
      <p>Jones, 77, was diagnosed with a form of dementia which has left him unable to communicate.</p>
      <p>Sir Michael, 76, told The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show that he visited Jones recently, taking a book they had written together more than 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>The comedian and Life Of Brian director laughed but only at the parts that he had written.</p>

      <p>“The other day I took a book that we’d written together in the 1980s called Bert Fegg’s Encyclopaedia Of All World Knowledge, which was sort of an anarchist children’s book,” Sir Michael said.</p>
      <p>“I read some of it – the things we’d written together – and amazing because Terry suddenly smiled and began to laugh.</p>
      <p>“But the key thing,” Sir Michael added, “was that he only laughed at the bits that he’d written! I thought, that shows that something is ticking over!”</p>
      <p>Despite the laughter, Sir Michael said his friend is “not terribly well. The kind of dementia he has is not something that can be cured particularly – it’s just a matter of time.</p>
      <p>“I go and see him, but he can’t speak much, which is a terrible thing.</p>
      <p>“For someone who was so witty and verbal and articulate and argued and debated and all that, to be deprived of speech is a hard thing,” the presenter and author told the Radio 2 show.</p>
      <p>Monty Python have been celebrating 50 years of the comedy troupe.</p>
      <p>The six-strong group first appeared on the BBC on October 5 1969 and went on to have global success with their often surreal comedy.</p>
