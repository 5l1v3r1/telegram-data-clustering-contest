      <h3>Barcelona manager brought Ivan Rakitić back into the fold against Dortmund</h3>
      <p>Ivan Rakitić is one of the best midfielders in the world. But unfortunately for him, Barcelona simply had too many good young players more than willing to take his place at the start of the season. But now, his status at the club could be restored.</p>
      <p>In Ernesto Valverde’s debut season as Barça manager, Rakitić quickly became the Basque coach’s favourite. He played almost every game, and had a fantastic season. The Croatia international carried his form into the World Cup, reaching the final.</p>
      <p>But the following season, Rakitić’s fortunes went down along with Barça’s. He had to fight for minutes with Arturo Vidal and Arthur, and his performances did not warrant a guaranteed spot in the starting lineup.</p>
      <p>But the ex-Sevilla captain really hit rock-bottom this season, after the signing of Frenkie de Jong. To allow De Jong to integrate properly, Valverde gave the young Dutchman plenty of playing time, and that meant that Rakitić was left on the bench.</p>
      <p>But against Borussia Dortmund, Rakitić made a comeback to the first-team, making only his second start of the season. But more importantly, Rakitić produced a vintage performance against Lucien Favre’s men, contributing to Barça’s win.</p>
      <p>The experienced campaigner showed that he still had it in him. With some beautiful touches and a 91% pass accuracy, Rakitić proved himself in front of a capacity Camp Nou. He even looked threatening up front.</p>
      <p>Of course, the rustiness led to a few errors here and there. For example, an early giveaway almost led to Dortmund taking the lead in the 2nd minute. He was also dispossessed a few times. But overall, Rakitić was very good.</p>
      <p>Since the Dortmund match was one of great importance, Rakitić’s inclusion in the starting lineup is of significance. The fact that the Croatian playmaker was preferred over the in-form Vidal and the usually reliable Arthur means that Valverde still has faith in him.</p>
      <p>Ivan Rakitić was widely expected to leave Barça in the January transfer window. Many big clubs are willing to go in for him. But now, he could actually stay at Barça beyond January. There is still hope for Ivan Rakitić.</p>
