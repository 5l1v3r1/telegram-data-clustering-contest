      <p>The expansion of the Redmi brand is being as powerful as what Xiaomi once offered. For this reason, it has prepared new products in ranges where to date it did not have a particularly relevant presence in it. And that will allow it to offer a complete ecosystem.</p>
      <h3>Imminent arrival of new Redmi products</h3>
      <p>The vice president of the firm, Lu Weibing has confirmed the arrival of completely new products next month. They will be presented in China with a smartphone that many expect, we are talking about the Redmi K30. <a href="https://www.weibo.com/u/1892653244">Lu Weibing</a> said that the company has also launched Redmi-branded smart TV and laptops in the market and thus, the products next in line includes routers and smart speakers. It has also confirmed that the devices will arrive next month.</p>

      <p>There is not much data regarding the new router and the smart speaker that <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Redmi">Redmi</a> prepares, but what is certain is that both will be used by voice commands and will use Artificial Intelligence -probably with specific processors for it- to optimize its operation.</p>
      <p>In short, Redmi continues to take steps to become increasingly similar to Xiaomi. And, therefore, to be a more global solution in the market. And, this may make users doubt because they may not find many differences between what both brands offer.</p>
