      <p>Skyrim fans, we’ve got some new mods for you today. The following mods aim to overhaul the game’s races, improve the NPC conversations, add a lot of new sound effects, allow players to use guns and improve the distant LOD textures.</p>
      <p>The first mod we have for you is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30657">Skyrace – Realistic Diverse Races</a>. This is a race mod which attempts to make the playable races more realistic. According to the modder, this is ideal for those seeking a better roleplaying, immersion and survival experience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194">Interesting NPCs</a>, on the other hand, introduces NPCs with more extensive dialogue and role play choices. PC gamers can expect over 250+ fully voiced NPCs, 25+ followers, 15+ marriage NPCs, and 50+ quests.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30658">Sounds of Skyrim</a> is an audio project that adds around 460+ sound effects to the game world. This mod affects almost every cell and region in the game. Furthermore, the sounds are affected by the time of day, weather and location.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30663">Skyrim Guns737372</a> adds some guns to the game that you can use, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3333">HD LODs Textures</a> improve the distant LOD textures. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29754">Skyrim Worldspace Fixes</a> is also a work in progression fixing important issues in Skyrim world space, and its latest version is available for download.</p>
      <p>Have fun!</p>
