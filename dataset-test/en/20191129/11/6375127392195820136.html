      <h3>SOME 72 prosecutors and investigators from Angeles City were given training by US experts in practical skills to prosecute online sexual exploitation, the United States Embassy in Manila said yesterday.</h3>

      <p>In partnership  with the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking and the International Justice Mission (IJM), the 72 prosecutors and investigators in Clark, Angeles City underwent a three-day training from Nov. 19 to 21.</p>
      <p>This is the fourth in a series of Prosecuting Online Sexual Exploitation (POSE) trainings which have provided participating prosecutors and investigators practical skills to effectively combat online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC).  </p>
      <p>USDOJ Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) legal and digital forensic experts shared best practices in using digital evidence to effectively investigate and prosecute these crimes.  </p>
      <p>Alongside Philippine forensic examiners, OSEC prosecutors discussed the fundamentals in collection, preservation, and use of digital evidence.  </p>
      <p>Cyber Court Judge Romeo Tagra of Marikina City discussed the legal framework governingcybercrime warrants, including the disposition of collected digital evidence in legal proceedings.</p>
      <p>Other topics discussed included means to obtain digital evidence from other countries, plea bargaining, and thespecial handling of child victims.</p>
      <p>The program culminated with mock trials where prosecutors, alongside investigators, built their casesagainst fictional perpetrators. Actual Metro Manila-based Cyber Court judges, including Judge Tagra, conducted the mock trials for each prosecutor-investigator team.</p>
