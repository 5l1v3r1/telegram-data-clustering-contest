      <p>NEW YORK, Nov. 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Saturn Cloud, a provider of data science tools, today announced it has launched the first-ever commercial offering of Dask, a Python-native parallel computing framework for scalable data science. This comes one month after the startup's first round of funding was announced.</p>

      <p>Dask offers data scientists advanced parallelism for analytics. Using existing Python APIs and data structures, Dask makes it easy to switch between Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to their Dask-powered equivalents. This makes Dask a natural choice for data scientists looking to scale analytics as it does not require knowledge of Java or Scala.</p>
      <p>"We are huge fans of Dask because it enables our team to get answers from big data in minutes instead of weeks," says Director of Data Science at a Fortune 1000 healthcare company. Previously, most data scientists in industry would wait weeks for their code to compile while analyzing large datasets; with Dask's parallelism, the code can execute at a speed that's not possible with standard computing equipment.</p>
      <p>As part of broadly introducing Dask to industry, Saturn is filling enterprise adoption needs around vendored support and service-level agreements, which has previously slowed Dask adoption at the enterprise level. The company is also offering a SQL compiler for businesses to more easily integrate Dask into their existing processes.</p>
      <p>"The massive amounts of data being created is making companies look for new innovative ways to handle their information -- parallel computing offers a low-cost way to solve this problem instead of buying more powerful computers for data scientists," says Demi Ajayi, engineer, employed atÂ Fortune 50 aerospace and technology companies.</p>
      <p>"We invested in Saturn because they saw the converging trends of big data growth, Python takeover in data science, and rise of cloud computing -- creating a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to offer industry an end-to-end data science platform equipped with automation and big data processing tools," recounts Ilya Kirnos, founder of SignalFire.</p>
      <p>The best place to keep up with this quickly growing startup is <u><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2654733-1&amp;h=606574962&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.saturncloud.io%2F&amp;a=www.saturncloud.io">www.saturncloud.io</a></u>, where you can find career openings, the company's blog, learn about new product releases, and more.</p>
