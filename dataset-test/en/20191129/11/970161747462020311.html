      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christmas/">Christmas</a> is less than a month away (26 days, but who’s counting).</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cadbury/">Cadbury</a> is already getting in the festive spirit with the return of its Secret Santa Postal Service, which lets you send chocolate to a friend or family member free of charge.</p>
      <p>From 11am to 7pm today only, swing by Riverside West on the South Bank to choose from several flavours of Cadbury and then pop the treat into the purple postbox, and make a loved one smile.</p>
      <p>It’s also the perfect opportunity to send a gift to someone you’ve had your eye on, or someone you don’t even like but know you need to get a present for (like your archenemy at work).</p>
      <p>Both the service and the chocolate is free, with several flavours to choose from, including original Dairy Milk, Whole Nut, Caramel, Fruit &amp; Nut and Oreo.</p>

      <p>Unlike Father Christmas, however, Cadbury has a limited reserve – it’s first come, first served.</p>
      <p>Get in there fast if you fancy it, as more than 50,000 chocolate bars have already been sent off.</p>
      <p>If you’re feeling Grinch-y, there’s nothing stopping you from sending the treats to yourself, though Santa might put you on his naughty list.</p>
      <p>In other Christmas news, swing by Covent Garden if you’re after a seasonal experience this December.</p>
      <p>Tiffany &amp; Co has just <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/tiffany-co-has-a-pretty-bougie-new-ice-rink-at-covent-garden-for-free-11234609/">opened an ice rink themed after New York City’s Central Park</a>, with huge replicas of the well-known blue boxes, as well as trees, snow and an ice globe scattered around Covent Garden.</p>
      <p>‘Covent Garden is one of the most magical places in London during the Christmas season and we’re delighted to welcome the Tiffany &amp; Co Winter Wonderland to the estate this year,’ said Michelle McGrath, director of Covent Garden.</p>
      <p>The space opened yesterday and will run until 1 December, before reopening again from 12 December until 24 December.</p>
