      <h1>Manuel Pellegrini outlines why he won't change despite West Ham's horrendous form</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers manager hasn't won a game of football since September 22 and is under pressure to right those wrongs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini says he has trust in himself to get West Ham back on the right track and has to remain calm despite the Hammers dire current predicament.</p>
      <p>West Ham are just one place and three points off the relegation zone. If you're a glass half full person, they are also only three points off 11th place Bournemouth in the standings in what is a very congested Premier League table.</p>
      <p>But the Hammers haven't won in more than two months, been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League One Oxford United and have conceded three goals in each of their last four games which, on the face of it, is relegation form.</p>
      <p>That has led to calls for Pellegrini to be sacked though the Hammers are backing him and their considerable investment in him. That said, the next two games against Chelsea and Wolves need to show big improvement with those behind the scenes hugely concerned and alarmed at the recent slide over the past couple of months.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has been successful wherever he has managed over the past 34 years but he is enduring one of his toughrst spells at the moment, even accused of a lack of care at the Hammers plight as it stands.</p>
      <p>He emphatically hit back at those claims on Thursday and also revealed how he believes he can get the Hammers turned back around and shooting up the standings away from the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>"More than ever [trusting himself], more than ever," he said.</p>

      <p>"Trust the way you work. Because you have a career behind you. You're not just starting a career.</p>
      <p>"Continue to believe in what you know or which is the way you must find the solution. For me, it's clear. We need a good performance, not to change it all, and hopefully we can do it as soon as we can."</p>
      <p>The manager showed some signs of becoming somewhat irked at his press conference on Thursday, the first time he has done that since joining the club in the summer of 2018, when he was asked if he didn't care.</p>
      <p>Not one to usually raise his voice in press conferences or on the training pitch, Pellegrini said he won't change his ways as if you react badly, you can make bad decision.</p>
      <p>"You must try to be calm because I don't think you can make good decisions if you are emotional," the Chilean added.</p>
      <p>"But the way you work inside, maybe you have another character. Maybe I have another character - but I don't try to show that by doing stupid things because you are in a bad moment.</p>

      <p>"You have one personality and you must try to keep it in the good moments and the bad moments. I think people are stronger when they need to be very strong, not when things are going well and are very easy. So at this moment I must be calm.</p>
      <p>"But you cannot have doubt of all you are doing. Maybe there are a lot of reasons why we are not getting the results. Before these six games, we worked exactly the same way we have these six games. Exactly the same. The same players, the same way of working, the same technical skills, the same physical work. We changed nothing."</p>
