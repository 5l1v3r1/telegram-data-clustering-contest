      <p>Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino said he had given the Premier League club "the best of me" during a 5-1/2-year tenure which ended with his sacking last week.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino said he had given the Premier League club "the best of me" during a 5-1/2-year tenure which ended with his sacking last week.</p>
      <p>The Argentine, who led Spurs to the Champions League final last season, was dismissed after a poor run of results in all competitions this season and replaced by Jose Mourinho who has since guided the team to two wins in two games.</p>

      <p>Speaking for the first time since losing his job, Pochettino reflected on "tough challenges" and "exciting success."</p>
      <p>"I gave the best of me to accomplish the objectives I was asked for in our first meeting," Pochettino said in a statement released by the League Managers Association. "There were equally tough challenges as exciting success."</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank (owner) Joe Lewis and (chairman) Daniel Levy for giving me the opportunity to be part of Tottenham's history... also everyone I met at Tottenham, club staff and football players during these 5-1/2 years."</p>
      <p>"Finally, I'd like to give a special mention to the fans who make this club so great with their fantastic support... best wishes for the future, I'm sure we'll cross paths again."</p>
