      <h1>‘Kylian will join Real Madrid,’ says Vasilyev</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:29:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Monaco’s vice president Vadim Vasilyev says Kylian Mbappe will eventually become a Real Madrid player.</p>
      <p>The young Frenchman, already one of the best on the planet despite being just 20-years-old, has been spuriously linked to Liverpool [<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/kylian-mbappe-transfer-real-madrid-20983447">Mirror</a>] but the reality is the potential financial demands of the deal make it practically impossible.</p>
      <p>Vasilyev sold Mbappe to PSG for a monumental sum two years ago, but considering he’s won a World Cup since and established himself a jaw-dropping reputation – any fee to buy him will surely have to break the €200m Neymar world-record.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Kylian will join Real Madrid, I do not know when, but it seems inevitable,” Vasilyev has told <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/des-son-enfance-mbappe-a-compris-qu-il-etait-special-confie-vadim-vasilyev-28-11-2019-8203851.php">Le Parisien.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“The club is very important in his life. Madrid had a more interesting offer than PSG in 2017 but he told me he that thought it was too early to leave France, and Paris was his home.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“He wanted to become a great player in France as he would have plenty of time and that showed Kylian’s intelligence – he is now the best player in France and PSG have enough finances to keep him.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Any side on the planet would love Mbappe, but we imagine Liverpool will have to look elsewhere for our marquee summer 2020 signing.</p>
      <p>We do unquestionably need another attacker to bolster the frontline, with the drop-off in quality after Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino considerable.</p>
      <p>Our rivals Manchester City have the likes of Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus on the bench, and while Divock Origi is a club legend and Xherdan Shaqiri well-liked – the issue is obvious.</p>
