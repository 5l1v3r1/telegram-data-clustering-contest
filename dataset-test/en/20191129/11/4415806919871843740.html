      <p>The family of Michaela McAreavey say they feel they will never get justice for her murder.</p>
      <p>The daughter of Tyrone football manager Mickey Harte was on honeymoon in Mauritius in 2011 with her husband when she was strangled in her hotel bedroom.</p>
      <p>In 2012, a jury found the two men accused of her murder not guilty and nobody has ever been convicted.</p>
      <p>Her husband John McAreavey says they co-operated with the investigation over the years, however they are now speaking out, as they feel they will never get justice.</p>
      <p>"Our approach was there is no point shouting and roaring and getting their backs up, we needed these guys on side with us," said Mr McAreavey.</p>
      <p>"We felt we should just support them and give them the opportunity to right the wrongs that happened in 2012.</p>
      <p>"We felt that was our best chance at delivering justice. So that was always the main objective.</p>
      <p>"But as time went on that has just failed and failed away."</p>
      <p>Mr McAreavey has recorded a podcast about Michaela's murder entitled Murder in Mauritius: The Murder of Michaela McAreavey.</p>
      <p>"It's important that the truth is told," he said.</p>
      <p>The podcast will be available from Monday, December 2.</p>
