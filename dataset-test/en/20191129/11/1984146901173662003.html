      <h1>Youth charity hosts huge pamper party to promote self-esteem in teenage girls</h1>
      <h2>The huge pamper party took place at Newcastle College, where teenage girls enjoyed makeovers, hair styling and nail treatments.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:13:27+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Goodwin</a></address>
      <p>Glamourous girls from across the North East enjoyed an evening of beauty treatments to promote wellbeing and self-esteem, courtesy of young people’s charity, NE Youth.</p>
      <p>The free event for girls aged between 13 and 17, offered gel nail treatments, hairstyling and make-up appointments.</p>
      <p>Before complimentary drinks and a two course meal prepared by students at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-college">Newcastle College</a> .</p>
      <p>Grace Mcnulty, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jarrow">Jarrow</a> , received nail and make-up treatments at the event. She said: “Today has helped me feel more confident about myself. I’ve learned how I can improve my eyeshadow, so that will help my self-esteem.”</p>

      <p>NE Youth were able to host the event at Newcastle College using the funds raised from charities during their <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/women-in-business">International Women’s Day</a> celebration.</p>
      <p>Louise Laws, development manager at NE Youth, organised the event to coincide with national <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/mental-health">mental health</a> awareness day.</p>
      <p>Louise said: “We thought this would be the perfect opportunity to host an event for young girls across the region to have a pamper and treat themselves to promote wellbeing.</p>
      <p>“The response to the event has been overwhelming, and within ten minutes of publishing the tickets, the event was booked up.”</p>
      <p>The event concluded with a meal and a motivational speech from BBC Newcastle radio presenter, Anna Foster, and Melody Five band member, Jodie Elliott.</p>
      <p>Anna, who started in radio over 20 years ago, spoke about the struggles she has faced as a woman in the industry.</p>
      <p>In an encoraging speech about female unity and empowerment, she said: “Instead of being bitter and whining about the issues I have faced, I decided to stick together with the other women in the workplace.</p>
      <p>“I’ve learned that you don’t have to look and behave a certain way to fit in. Stand tall and look confident, even if you don’t always feel it.</p>
      <p>“Be kind and compliment yourself, because if you respect and value yourself, other people will do that in return.”</p>
      <p>An emotional Jodie Elliott, who started in Melody Five aged 12, also spoke about how she maintained her self-esteem while being in a girl band.</p>
      <p>The teary 15-year-old said: “You may not be the prettiest girl in the room and you may not feel the most confident, but giving that little bit of extra kindness to someone is going to make their day.</p>
      <p>“Compliment your close friends and make sure they’re doing okay by checking up on them sometimes.</p>
      <p>“Remember, you don’t always have to have the biggest of friendship groups. I have two or three close friends and they’re just perfect for me.”</p>
      <p>Following the success of the evening, Louise is eager to organise future events, as she believes there is a need to bring girls together in a positive, supportive <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/environment">environment</a> .</p>
