      <p>It’s a stellar black hole, which is the kind that forms following the death or explosion of a massive star.</p>
      <p>Before this discovery, researchers thought the size limit for black holes was less than 20 times the mass of the sun, but this black hole, known as LB-1, appears to debunk that theory.</p>
      <p>Its mass is 70 times larger than the sun, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
      <p>No worries, though: This monster is 15,000 light years away from Earth.</p>
      <p>The findings were published in Wednesday’s edition of the journal Nature.</p>
