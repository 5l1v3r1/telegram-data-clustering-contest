      <h1>Governor Ngilu Pays Dearly After Clashing With Senators</h1>

        <b>The Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee has on November 29 imposed a fine of Ksh 500,000 to Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a video by<i> Citizen TV</i>, PAIC Chairperson Senator Moses Kajwang' gave the order after she failed to submit the necessary audit documents, even after having been alerted in two previous summons.</p>
      <p>“Section 19 of the Powers and Privileges Act says that where a witness fails to satisfy a specific house committee, the committee may impose a fine of not more than Ksh 500,000 having regard for the witness condition in life. The committee may also order for the arrest of the witness,” reads a section of the Powers and Privileges Act.</p>

      <p>“Having considered the submissions, circumstances, history of our engagement summons and the opportunity we gave you to meet the auditor general, I rule that the committee applies sanctions in Section 19 of the Powers and Privileges Act and charge you Ksh 500,000 for appearing without relevant documents,” stated Senator Kajwang'.</p>
      <p>The chairperson further directed that the cost should be incurred by the governor and not the County Government of Kitui.</p>
      <p>“The money should be payable to the house clerk after the governor receives a letter from the house indicating these orders,” he continued. </p>
      <p>Governor Ngilu failed to honour the committee summons on March 12 and later on June 11, therefore, according to the chairperson, the committee was justified to invoke the fine.</p>
      <p>“We went to Uasin Gishu County and the governor there agreed to appear for a sitting before us. When we went to Kitui County, the governor gave us a communication that she was busy with other activities,” remarked Senator Kajwang'.</p>

      <p>However, Governor Ngilu was adamant that she didn’t ignore the summons.</p>
      <p>“We came here on Tuesday but you failed to appear. Meru senator had a Njuri Ncheke meeting to attend in Meru but didn’t go. I also come from Homa Bay and that is when we conduct burials at my place, you just decided to fail us,” remarked an angry Kajwang'.</p>
      <p>The governor also got into an argument with Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi, who wanted to know why she failed to meet the auditor general for information about the county’s audit, an accusation that Ngilu aggressively refuted.</p>
