      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennifer-lopez/">Jennifer Lopez</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alex-rodriguez/">Alex Rodriguez</a> put family first this holiday season as they shared snaps from their low key Thanksgiving celebrations.</p>
      <p>The couple, who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/10/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-engaged-two-years-khloe-kardashian-leads-congratulations-8877974/">announced their engagement in March</a> after two years of dating, have both had their fair shares of difficult relationships in the past, but showed that integrated families don’t need to be complicated when it comes to spending time together.</p>
      <p>Jennifer has 11-year-old twins Emme and Max with former husband Marc Anthony, while former baseball player Alex has two kids, Natasha, 15, and Ella, 11, from his previous marriage, but the family seemed determined to enjoy an understated day together.</p>
      <p>Documenting the special day on Instagram, all the kids got stuck into the food preparations, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/17/how-much-is-jennifer-lopez-worth-and-will-she-win-a-2020-oscar-for-hustlers-10758065/">the Hustlers star</a> filming Max as he carefully peeled cooking apples as she captioned the post: ‘Here we go!!’</p>
      <p>Later sharing a series of pictures, including a selfie with the children and an adorable picture with Alex’s daughters as they sipped on some buck’s fizz, J-Lo looked cool and low key in a black polo neck and white apron while wearing her hair in a ponytail.</p>

      <p>‘So grateful today and everyday! Blessings,’ she wrote, including the obligatory autumnal leaf and turkey emojis before adding: ‘HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE!!’</p>

      <p>In a time that’s all about being thankful, Alex and Jennifer have been keen to teach their kids about the importance of giving back, last month <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/jennifer-lopez-and-fiancer-alex-rodriguez-donate-a-years-supply-of-food-to-students-in-need-10985223/">donating a year’s supply of food to students in need</a>.</p>
      <p>It all began after a Tennessee teacher wrote a viral Facebook post about one of her students who couldn’t afford to eat.</p>
      <p>When JLo and her hubby-to-be saw the post, they were ‘brought to tears’ and decided they needed to do something about it.</p>
      <p>As part-owners in a company called Tiller &amp; Hatch, the pair decided to ‘donate a year’s worth of their yummy, healthy meals for the students and their school’s food pantry,’ JLo announced to her 103 million Instagram followers.</p>
      <p>Now that’s what we call using your power for good.</p>
