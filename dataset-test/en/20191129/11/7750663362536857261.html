      <p>Melville, who joined the governing body in July 2016, has opted to pursue new opportunities and will leave the post next month.</p>
      <p>"I am proud of all that the organisation has achieved over the last three years during some challenging times," said Melville in a statement on the England Rugby website.</p>
      <p>"I believe that England Rugby is in a great place and that leaving after the 2019 Rugby World Cup is the right time as the RFU start a new era and prepare for the next Rugby World Cup cycle."</p>

      <p>During Melville's tenure, Eddie Jones' England reached the World Cup final in Japan where they were beaten by South Africa earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old also acted as the RFU's interim chief executive in the first half of 2019, ahead of Bill Sweeney's arrival as CEO in May.</p>
      <p>Sweeney said: "On behalf of everyone at the RFU, I would like to thank Nigel for his valuable contribution to the organisation and to England Rugby.</p>
      <p>"His professionalism and knowledge of rugby and sport is outstanding and he will be missed. In particular, I am grateful for the support that he has given to me since I joined. He leaves with our very best wishes for the future."</p>
