      <h1>Russia Reportedly Considers Ban on Using Crypto as Means of Payment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:54:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/russia">Russia</a> is allegedly preparing a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services.</p>
      <p>A report from Izvestia on Nov. 29 <a href="https://iz.ru/948506/tatiana-bochkareva/iskhod-iz-kripty-v-rossii-zapretiat-rasplachivatsia-bitkoinami">cites</a> several sources allegedly familiar with ongoing discussions at the country’s central bank, financial regulator and Ministry of Finance in support of a ban.</p>
      <h3>Legal measures not yet officially confirmed</h3>
      <p>At present, cryptocurrencies can be used for e-commerce and many Russian freelancers,  including programmers, designers and copywriters, agree to receive their salaries in Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) or Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), Vladislav Antonov told Izvestia. </p>
      <p>Antonov, an analyst at Alpari Information and Analytical Center, noted that while they are not officially permitted, cryptocurrencies are often used to purchase a range of goods and services; including tickets, computers and household appliances, renting an apartment, or booking a hotel.</p>
      <p>If Izvestia’s sources are correct, Russian regulators think a ban is necessary to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used as payment, citing their concerns about crime.</p>
      <p>The report refers to comments from Alexey Yakovlev, deputy head of the banking regulation department of the Ministry of Finance, who reportedly reaffirmed at a recent conference on crypto-economics, “We do not see any basis for cryptocurrencies to be used as a means of payment.”</p>
      <p>The press department of the central bank has not officially confirmed the drafting of a formal bill, but emphasized that private cryptocurrencies cannot be equated with fiat currency and cannot be considered a legitimate way to pay for purchases: </p>
      <blockquote>“If a decision is made to ban cryptocurrencies as a means of payment at the level of legislation, we consider it appropriate to support this position.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Law will foster a “gray market”</h3>
      <p>The report claims that the Russian crypto community is readying itself for a potential tightening of restrictions, with rumors allegedly circulating that criminal penalties could carry terms of 5–8 years. </p>
      <p>Due to the difficulties of enforcement, some industry representatives reportedly believe the ban will be limited to a series of “demonstration cases” intended to dissuade the public from flouting the law.</p>
      <p>Antonina Levashenko, head of the Russia-OECD Center for RANEPA, has warned that the bill could foster the development of a gray market, outside of regulators’ oversight.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-new-law-would-let-police-confiscate-bitcoin-from-2021">reported</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/russia">Russia</a> is also thought to be attempting to establish legal statutes — set to come into law by 2021 — allowing the government to confiscate digital assets.</p>
