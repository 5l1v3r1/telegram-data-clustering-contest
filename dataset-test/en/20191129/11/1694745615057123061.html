      <h1>E.T. Just Entered the Race For Best Commercial of 2019, and We’re Not Crying, You Are</h1>

      <p>The festive advert game may have just been won, with Sky Atlantic (UK) and Xfinity's (US) commercial, released on Thursday. The commercial begins with two children playing outside in the snow while their mom is in the kitchen. The lights begin to flicker and the music turns ominous, and just when you think Sky and Xfinity have made a terrible choice for their 2019 holiday advert storyline, E.T. pops out from behind a snow man to scare the hell out of the two kids, and simultaneously warm our hearts. The kids are terrified, but when E.T. calls out for his childhood friend, Elliott, who turns out to be the kids' dad (played by the same actor from the original film, Henry Thomas), the pair are reunited after 37 years apart.</p>
      <p>It's heartwarming, it's sweet, and if watching E.T. learn about the Internet and snuggle on the couch with Elliott's 2019 family isn't the most wholesome thing you watch today, well, you're wrong. Watch the full advert above, before watching it once more and reliving some of the most iconic lines from the 1982 film.</p>
