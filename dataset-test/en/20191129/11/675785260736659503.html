      <h1>Sir Mo Farah performs retirement U-turn ahead of 2020 Tokyo Olympics</h1>
      <h2>Sir Mo Farah initially had his heart set on winning marathon gold in Asia ext year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:49:47+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Spink, https://www.facebook.com/alexspinkmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Sir Mo Farah has reversed his decision to retire from the track and will defend his 10,000 metres title at next summer’s Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>Britain’s most successful ever athlete had set his heart on winning marathon gold in Japan, having spent the past two years competing on the roads.</p>
      <p>But he could only finish eighth in Chicago last month - and then watched world record holder Eliud Kipchoge become the first man in history to clock a sub-two hour marathon in Vienna.</p>
      <p>That would appear to have convinced Farah that by far his best chance of adding an 11th global title lies back on the track where the 10,000m, in particular, has not moved on since he left it.</p>
      <p>Farah announced: ”Next year, I'm going to be back on the track and I'm going to give it a go in the 10,000m.</p>

      <p>"Hopefully I haven't lost my speed but I will train hard for it and see what I can do. I'm really excited.”</p>
      <p>A source close to the Somali-born Londoner said he would focus on the 10,000m next year then “probably” return to marathon competition.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old has four Olympic gold medals to his name having completed the 5,000m and 10,000m double both in London and Rio.</p>
      <p>"It's been really exciting competing in the marathon over the last couple of years,” he said.</p>
      <p>"To win the Chicago Marathon was nice and to finish third in the London Marathon was OK, and it's been a great learning curve for me.”</p>
