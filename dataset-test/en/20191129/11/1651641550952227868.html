      <p>Microsoft UK is running its own Black Friday sale on Surface Products and accessories.</p>
      <p>Their headline offer is amazing Surface Pro 7 deals starting with a massive £375 discount.  Microsoft Store is now selling Surface Pro 7 with Intel Core i3, 4GB RAM and 128 GB storage bundled with a Type Cover for just £699.</p>
      <p>Surface Pro 7 deals come along regularly, but none as good as this, so early into the life of the device. At this low price, I think this Surface Pro 7 bundle offers a lot more value than competing devices in its class.</p>
      <p>The new <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-officially-unveils-surface-pro-7/">Surface Pro 7</a> was only launched a month and a half ago.  The Surface Pro 7 is powered by the new 10th gen Intel processors which is coupled with 4/8/16 GB of RAM and 128/256/512 GB and 1 TB of Storage. The company will be giving users the option to choose between i3, i5 and i7 variants. The company is finally adding a USB Type-C port to Surface Pro 7. The Surface Pro 7 will feature the same 3:2 aspect ratio on a 12.3-inch Pixelsense display. Microsoft Surface Pro 7 will support fast charging bringing the laptop up to 80% charge in just an hour.</p>
      <p>Find the deal and many more <a href="https://afflnk.microsoft.com/c/321292/433017/7593?u=https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/b/black-friday">here from Microsoft Store.</a></p>
