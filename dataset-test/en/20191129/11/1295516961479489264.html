      <h1>Star Wars: Another Original Trilogy Staple May Return in Rise of Skywalker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:11:38+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bea Caicoya</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> shared a short behind-the-scenes featurette encompassing the entire Skywalker Saga ahead of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>, and one blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot could indicate another original trilogy character (or <i>characters</i>) is making their return.</p>
      <p>At the 2:43 mark, we see Warwick Davis in his Wicket costume reaching for his Ewok mask, with the costume visibly covered in salt-and-pepper fur to signify the in-universe passage of time. This is preceded by a b-roll shot of Carrie Fisher and an 11-year-old Davis on the set of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, making it easy to spot the differences between the two Davis'.</p>

      <p>Ewoks, of course, were a hit with children when they <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-return-jedi-ewoks-not-wookiees-reason/amp/">first appeared in <i>Return of the Jedi</i></a>, spinning off into an animated series and their own live-action movie.<i> The Rise of Skywalker</i>, meanwhile, will presumably tie all the loose ends of the episodic films and offer fans the chance to give a final goodbye to beloved characters. Should <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-final-trailer-familiar-nostalgia/">J.J. Abrams follow in George Lucas' footsteps</a> and make the third episode of the third trilogy "rhyme" with the other movies, including Ewoks certainly makes sense.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca and C-3PO will be traveling to the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-rise-skywalker-death-star-kef-bir/">ruins of the <i>Deathstar II</i></a> on the ocean moon of Kef Bir. That said, the forest moon of Endor, where the Ewoks are from, must have been pretty close by, as that's where the Rebels shot it down in <i>Episode VI</i>.</p>
