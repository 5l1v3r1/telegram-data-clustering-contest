        <b>Following the two <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a>s of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> crashing into one another at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> a couple of weeks ago, the former has admitted both drivers share responsibility for the collision.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leclerc and Vettel were on a straight at Interlagos, fighting over the P4 spot in the final stages of the Brazilian Grand Prix and the two made the slightest of contact and both suffered a puncture as a consequence; leaving Ferrari pointless in South America.</p>
      <p>The Monegasque driver has revealed him and his German team-mate sat down and discussed the incident when back in Maranello.</p>
      <p><i>"We called with Seb and we tried to understand both of our situations," </i>Leclerc said in the FIA press conference prior to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix weekend. <i>"I think probably Seb shouldn't have gone to the left and he knows it and I probably could have done a better job of avoiding him going to the left.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"So yeah, both of us have a bit of responsibility, but the most important thing is that everything is clear with Seb and we move forward."</i>
