      <h1>Feckless UK voters? Johnson rejects criticism over old article</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:20:19+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday dismissed criticism of an old article he wrote condemning single mothers and "feckless" working-class men, saying the quotes were taken out of context.</p>
      <p>In a newly-unearthed article from 1995, when he was a journalist, Johnson described working-class men as "likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless".</p>
      <p>The quotes were splashed across the front page of the left-wing Daily Mirror tabloid, under the tagline "What he really thinks", putting them centre stage of the campaign for the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>The newspaper also noted that in the article for the Spectator magazine, the Conservative leader had described children of single mothers as "ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate".</p>
      <p>"These are 25-year-old quotations culled from articles written I think before I was even in politics," Johnson told LBC radio on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said the "words are lifted out of context" and were an "absolute distortion" of what he believes.</p>
      <p>He accused the opposition Labour party, which said the remarks were "outrageous", of digging up old quotes to shift attention away from its policy on Brexit.</p>
      <p>"They're just trying to distract from the reality that they have no plan to get out us out of the European Union," Johnson said.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls currently show the Conservatives, who have promised to get Britain out of the bloc on January 31, are heading for victory next month.</p>
      <p>A major survey on Wednesday suggested they would take several seats from Labour in traditional working-class areas in northern and central England.</p>
      <p>Labour chairman Ian Lavery said Johnson's remarks about working-class men were "outrageous".</p>
      <p>He accused Johnson of being "a man out of touch with reality and whose ignorance and hatred of working-class communities knows no bounds".</p>
      <p>Johnson has previously come under scrutiny for using offensive language in his articles, mostly written before entering politics -- but some more recently.</p>
      <p>Last year he was criticised for writing that Muslim women in full face veils looked like letter boxes, while defending their right to wear what they want.</p>
      <p>The comments fuelled questions about a wider problem of Islamophobia in the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>"When I write this stuff, I never set out to cause pain or hurt," Johnson said on Friday, repeating a pledge for an independent inquiry into all forms of prejudice within his party.</p>
