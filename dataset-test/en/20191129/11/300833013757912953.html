      <h4>Remove iPhone case</h4>
      <p>There are so many iPhone cases out there, designed mostly for protection purpose. Some of them have a thick design and not fit the iPhone properly. Check if the case you are using for your iPhone doesn’t cover the ring/silent switch. Remove that case completely from your iPhone, and see if that makes any difference.</p>

      <h4>Toggle the ring/silent switch button</h4>
      <p>Maybe you have done this trick before, but do it one more time. If the button is in the ring state, switch it to the silent state. Then, switch it to the ring mode again, and ask your friend to call you. Make sure you switch it properly. You can see the difference between the ring and the silent mode in the picture below.</p>

When you are attending a meeting or want to take a rest for a few hours, you can rely on this handy feature. What happens if you activate the “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321">Do Not Disturb</a>“? Your<a href="https://www.technobezz.com/forum/#apple.77"> iPhone </a>will not ring, but it still allows the phone calls to come in and as you won’t hear the sound, you will see missed calls. In some cases, the user accidentally turns this feature on without even realizing. You can check at a glance to the top-left side of your iPhone screen. If you see the moon icon, it means the Do Not Disturb mode is activated. To disable it, follow the steps below:</p>

      <h3>What else?</h3>
      <h4>Clean speaker holes</h4>
      <p>After you have tried all the troubleshooting steps, and if none of them worked, try to clean speaker holes. If you find dirt covers the speaker holes, you can clean it using a duster or toothpick. Avoid using any liquid because it can enter the iPhone and damage the components.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Check headphone jack hole</h4>
      <p>Take a look at the headphone jack hole. The broken part of headphone that is left inside the hole, can cause iPhone not ringing problem because the iPhone will detect the call that comes in as an earphone mode. If you find nothing there, try to plug the original earphone. Call your number and if you can hear the sound, then the problem is related to your iPhone speaker. Otherwise, there might be a hardware issue.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Charging trick</h4>
      <p>This trick will not resolve the problem, but it can help you find the right solution. The loudspeaker of iPhone connects to the charging port cable. The idea of this trick is to check if the issue is associated with hardware or not.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plug your iPhone in the USB port on your computer or a wall outlet for charging</li>
        <li>Test your iPhone by calling it from the other device. Does it ring?</li>
        <li>Now, unplug the lightning cable from the iPhone. Then call it again using a different device to check if it’s ringing or not.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you hear a ringing sound when the iPhone is charged, but it doesn’t happen when it’s unplugged, likely it’s a hardware issue. The issue may occur on a lightning port that is connected to the speakers.</p>
      <p> </p>
