      <p>Paul Joseph Doyle, 41, Joshua Barrett, 22, Luke Mander, 22 and Keir Carter, 18, were members of an armed masked gang who have been convicted of carrying out nearly 30 violent robberies.</p>
      <p>The men are facing jail sentences after being convicted of stealing cars and motorhomes across the West Midlands, Staffordshire and as far away as Weston Super Mare.</p>
      <p>The gang, based in Chelmsley Wood, Birmingham, always wore masks to avoid identification and attacked and threatened motorists returning to parked cars usually in busy shopping centres and railway stations, Birmingham Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>They often used group violence and imitation firearms on victims which included a pregnant woman.</p>
      <p>On one occasion they briefly kidnapped a recovery driver to re-steal a car that was being taken to safety after being recovered by police.</p>
      <p>The four men were prepared to use or threaten serious violence against vulnerable motorists when they knew that CCTV cameras would be recording them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in a robbery at a hop, they produced a Luger pistol and stole cigarettes, alcohol and cash in the process all when the storekeeper was eight months’ pregnant.</p>
      <p>Some offences were caught on CCTV, others featured recovery of forensic evidence linking one or more defendants through items dropped at the scene or stolen vehicles shown photographed on mobile phones linked to them and the links between the defendants were shown by mobile phone analysis.</p>
      <p>Doyle, of Auckland Drive, Chelmsley Wood, was found guilty of robbery, conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm intending to rob, possession of an imitation firearm intending to cause fear of violence, kidnapping, and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal.</p>
      <p>Barrett, of Greenhill Way, Shirley, Solihull, was found guilty of robbery, conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm intending to rob, possession of an imitation firearm intending to cause fear of violence, conspiracy to steal and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, conspiracy to rob.</p>
      <p>Mander, of Kingsbury Road, Erdington, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm intending to rob, robbery, kidnapping, conspiracy to steal, possession of cannabis with intent to supply. He also pleaded guilty to robbery, possession of cannabis with intent to supply, conspiracy to rob.</p>
      <p>Carter, of Kingsbury Road, Erdington, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, and possession of a Class B drug.</p>
      <p>David Rouse, of the CPS, said: “This was nothing less than an organised crime gang who were brazen, violent and systematic.</p>
      <p>"The CCTV footage which captured their crime was graphic and shocking and no one who saw it will forget it. Many of the victims were badly affected and traumatised by what had happened.</p>
      <p>"The defendants have been brought to justice today following a very large investigation by three police forces and by detailed and painstaking work by the prosecuting team to present the large volume of evidence recovered in the most persuasive way, and they can expect to receive significant sentences for their crimes.</p>
      <p>“I would like to commend the investigating and prosecuting teams for the huge amount of hard work which was needed, and most of all, the many victims and witnesses who came forward despite their fear to report this very serious offending. The message is – report it and we can bring someone to justice for it.”</p>
