      <h1>‘In Contact With Four MLAs’: After Maharashtra, Sanjay Raut Claims Shiv Sena Will Create New Political Front In Goa</h1>

      <p>Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Friday (29 November) predicted that after Maharashtra, there could "be a miracle" and a potential political earthquake in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Goa soon.</p>
      <p>"At least four MLAs, including those with Goa Forward Party President Vijay Sardesai are in contact with Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>"We plan to form a separate front in that state with various parties, including Congress… We are hopeful that there could be a ‘miracle' in Goa also soon," Raut told the media.</p>
      <p>The Sena leader's comments on the political situation in the neigbouring state came a day after the Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress's Maha Vikas Aghadi-led by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray took office.</p>
