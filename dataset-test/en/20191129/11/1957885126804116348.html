      <h1>£520 off an XPS 15 OLED laptop is an insane Black Friday deal</h1>
      <h2>This top-spec model includes a Core i9, GTX 1650, 1TB NVMe SSD and 32GB RAM.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:19:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author">Will Judd</a></address>
      <p>There's an excellent Dell XPS 15 mega deal on right now, <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3kau">discounting the highest-spec model by £520</a>, bringing the total to just under two thousand British pounds. That princely sum gets you a bleeding-edge specification: a 9th-gen Core i9 9980HK octa-core processor and GTX 1650 4GB discrete graphics card, backed with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB NVMe SSD.</p>
      <p>The screen is impressive too. It's a 15-inch 4K OLED model, a rarity on a laptop of any price and something of a wonder to behold. The resolution and colour reproduction of the screen make this XPS 15 laptop perfect for content creation tasks like image or video editing, helped by the powerful processor and heaps of RAM under the hood.</p>
      <p>Several Digital Founder (and indeed, Gamer Network) staffers rely on XPS laptops as their daily drivers. Those we spoke to loved the excellent screens, big touchpads and the large number of ports available. The only weak point of the design is the keyboard, which isn't bad but lacks the tactility of options from the likes of Asus or Lenovo. Still, the laptop is a clever design, especially with the improved placement of the front-facing camera above the screen (rather than below it) in recent models.</p>

      <p>When it comes to gaming, the laptop is surprisingly capable, with the GTX 1650 providing noticeably better performance than the old GTX 1050. Even in new games, the laptop should stick between 40 and 60fps at 1080p with ultra settings, with higher frame-rates possible if you are willing to sacrifice some graphical fidelity. The beefy 9980HK CPU should also be capable of higher frame-rates at 1080p in esports titles like Counter-Strike, if you hook this laptop up to a high refresh rate monitor (psst, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-black-friday-deals-gaming-monitors">Black Friday monitor deals</a> here!) Some older games should even run well at 4K.</p>
      <p>If you're in the market for a premium laptop, the XPS 15 is one of the best available and this price represents a considerable savings. Most importantly, this laptop comes with the Rich Leadbetter seal of approval. You'll have to be fast though, with 62 per cent of stock claimed at the time of writing! <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3kau">Click here to see the deal</a> if you're interested.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> If you're after a more gaming-focused laptop at a much lower price, the G3 15 is also discounted in a Dell Mega Deal today. <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3kas">A £220 saving has been applied</a>, bringing the laptop to £700. The G3 15 has the same GTX 1650 graphics card as the XPS 15 above, paired with a ninth-gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of dual-channel RAM and a capacious 512GB NVMe SSD. Given the 1080p display, you should expect quite good gaming performance at a much lower price than the XPS. However, the 8GB of RAM is a bit limiting, and you may want to upgrade this to 16GB in the future for a nominal cost. Altogether though, it's a good deal that's worth considering.</p>
