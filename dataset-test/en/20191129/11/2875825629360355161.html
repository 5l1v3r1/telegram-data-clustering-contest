      <h2>The I'm A Celebrity star said last night that it had been five or six years since she'd spoken to former stepdaughter Khloe and that she doesn't know why</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:08:11+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> says she hasn't spoken to former stepdaughter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> for five or six years - and that she doesn't know why.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn opened up about the dark feud on last night's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> as she was asked by her campmates how her children had responded to the news of her transition.</p>
      <p>The US reality star spoke warmly about how wonderful her children had been and how they all told her they were proud and would love her and support her no matter what.</p>
      <p>But she made a point of saying that <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> star Khloe had fallen out with her, and that it was a particular shame as they were once so close.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, then known as Bruce, wed Khloe's mum Kris Jenner in 1991, and raised Khloe from the age of five.</p>
      <p>But why did it all go wrong between Khloe and Caitlyn?</p>

      <p>There are two main reasons behind the feud.</p>
      <p>The first is that Khloe was upset that Caitlyn didn't fully explain her plans to transition to her.</p>
      <p>Following her split from Kris in 2013, Caitlyn began growing out her hair and secretly having surgical procedures that are considered to be precursors to transition, such as a tracheal shave.</p>
      <p>After deciding she was finally going to go through with the surgery at the age of 65, after a lifetime of suffering from gender dysphoria, she sat her kids down one by one to tell them what was going on.</p>
      <p>But Khloe claimed that Caitlyn had refused to tell them the truth about her new identity and that she let them find out through the media.</p>

      <p>Khloe once said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show: "We kept asking him, 'Bruce, like what's going on? We're hearing all these rumours?' and he kept telling us one thing but really he knew he was transitioning and wouldn't be honest with us.</p>
      <p>"So really we felt like the last to know so that was hard for us, especially me."</p>
      <p>Khloe also spoke about her issues on The Howard Stern Show, and she was very angry by this point.</p>
      <p>She raged: "I don't give a f**k what you want to do - just stop lying to us about things... Just lay it on the table, what are we doing? What's happening? Even then he didn't tell us... we didn't know when he was going to start fully dressing as Caitlyn."</p>
      <p>Caitlyn is said to have reacted to the outburst with a string of angry messages, but Khloe was unapologetic for the things she said.</p>

      <p>The other reason behind their fallout was the things Caitlyn said about Kris in her cover story interview with Vanity Fair, when she officially unveiled her new name to the world, and in her book The Secrets Of My Life.</p>
      <p>In the Vanity Fair story, published in June 2015, Caitlyn accused Kris of making her feel "weak and inferior" and said she knew all about her desire to be a woman.</p>
      <p>However, Kris has always vehemently denied this and says she had no idea.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn said in her book that she had been taking hormones and thinking about transitioning before she met Kris, but had decided not to not long before she met and fell in love with the Kardashian momager.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says the hormones had given her B-cup breasts, that she later had liposuctioned away, and that she and Kris had an agreement that she'd keep her women's clothing locked away in a trunk where the children couldn't find it.</p>

      <p>Kris denies all of this.</p>
      <p>She was once seen yelling down the phone to Kim on an episode of their show: "He can go f*** himself. I honestly wish I never met this man. I mean, just f*** you, Bruce."</p>
      <p>Talking about the angry text exchange between herself and Caitlyn, Khloe said: "I said, 'You slaughtered my mother and you have the nerve to say, 'What happened to family sticking together?' You jumped that ship as soon as you attacked my mom.'</p>
      <p>"... She can tell me to f**k off all she wants. I don't have a relationship with her. I'm done."</p>
