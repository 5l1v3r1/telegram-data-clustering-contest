      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/5sos/">5 Seconds of Summer</a> are heading off on tour next year and we couldn’t be more excited.</p>
      <p>The Australian pop punk band have <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/09/5-seconds-summer-demand-fresh-puppies-backstage-tour-fair-play-9875543/">headlined their own UK shows</a> five times in the past (as well as opening for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> back in the day), but will be returning to our part of the world with a new album next year.</p>
      <p>Playing eight dates across the UK and Ireland in May, Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood and Ashton Irwin will perform in cities including London, Birmingham and Cardiff and you can bet we will definitely be there.</p>
      <p>Speaking about their return to the UK, the band said: ‘We are so excited to bring the No Shame tour to the UK in 2020.</p>
      <p>‘The new album is almost ready and we cannot wait for people to hear it. We truly believe these new songs capture the DNA of this band but also represent a new era for 5 Seconds of Summer.’</p>

      <p>Recently, lead singer Luke was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/18/5-seconds-summers-luke-hemmings-defends-girlfriend-sierra-deaton-trolls-targeting-looks-10767664/">forced to speak out against cruel trolls</a>, after a fan with ‘5SOS’ in her username posted an unflattering comparison photo of his girlfriend Sierra Deaton to a cartoon duck.</p>

      <p>He wrote: ‘I see stuff like this too often. It makes me sad women make other women feel like they’re not good enough.’</p>
      <p>‘The same people that talk about kindness &amp; being PC say awful things to someone I care about every day. I know this isn’t everyone but I see it a lot &amp; had to say something.’</p>
      <p>Fans soon got #WeLoveYouSierra trending in support of Luke and Sierra, and proving that the nasty trolls are just a very small percentage of their online following.</p>
      <p>Luke’s 5SOS bandmate Calum Hood also showed his support by tweeting ‘Sierra is a BEAUT’ in response to Luke’s post.</p>
      <p>Now that’s what we call friendship.</p>
