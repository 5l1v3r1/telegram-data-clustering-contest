      <p>MAJURO, Marshall Islands: More than 200 people have been forced to flee their homes, after they were inundated by freak waves in the Marshall Islands capital Majuro.</p>
      <p>Swells averaging 5m washed rocks and debris onto roads, temporarily cutting access to the international airport at the peak of the flooding on Wednesday (Nov 27).</p>

      <p>The Red Cross set up evacuation centres at two schools, with local churches and Majuro's mosque also offering help to fleeing residents.</p>
      <p>The Marshall Islands are one of the Pacific nations on the front line of climate change, causing increasingly intense weather phenomena and storm surges linked to rising seas.</p>
      <p>Climate researcher Murray Ford said such factors may have played a role in this week's flooding but were not the main cause.</p>
      <p>"The key driver of this current inundation appears to be a large swell which has arrived from a more northerly direction than the typical trade wind swell," he said.</p>
      <p>"This particular event would be best described as a large swell, meeting a high, but not unusually high tide."</p>
      <p>Disaster response officials were expected to complete a damage assessment on Friday.</p>
