      <p>Australians affected by recent devastating wildfires in the country have joined young environmentalists kicking off a global protest demanding that governments act against climate change.</p>
      <p>The “global day of action” involves rallies in hundreds of cities around the world.</p>
      <p>It comes days before officials gather on Monday in Madrid for talks on tackling climate change.</p>
      <p>Janet Reynolds, who joined a protest in Sydney, said she had lost everything in an “inferno, an absolute firestorm that raced through my property”.</p>

      <p>Speaking outside the local offices of Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s Liberal Party, student Daisy Jeffrey said: “People have lost their homes, people have lost their lives. We have to ask: How far does this have to go before our government finally takes action?”</p>
      <p>Further rallies were taking places in cities worldwide, including Washington, London, Berlin and Madrid.</p>
      <p>Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, who is travelling across the Atlantic by sailboat to attend the climate talks next week, sent a message of support to protesters.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s needed. Everyone’s welcome. Join us,” she said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>About two dozen environmental activists in the German capital symbolically jumped into the chilly waters of the Spree river in front of parliament to protest against a government-backed package of measures they say will not be enough to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>The package was blocked Friday by Germany’s upper house, which represents the country’s 16 states.</p>
