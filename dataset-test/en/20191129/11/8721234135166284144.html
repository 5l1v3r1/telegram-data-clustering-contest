        <b>With the <i>Physics World</i> 2019 Breakthrough of the Year due to be announced on 12 December, <i>Physics World</i> journalists look back at the past decade of winners and explore how research in that field has moved on. Here <i>Michael Banks</i> examines the 2009 breakthrough for the first “quantum computer”</b>
      </p>
      <p>“A <i>tour de force</i>” is how physicist Boris Blinov from the University of Washington <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/tiny-device-is-first-complete-quantum-computer/">described research</a> carried out at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado, in 2009. For decades physicists had dreamt of building a quantum computer that can solve problems faster than a conventional counterpart. Then in August 2009, a NIST team led by Jonathan Home unveiled the first small-scale device that could be described as a quantum computer. The work represented a huge step forward – so much so that we choose this development as the very first <i>Physics World</i> 2009 Breakthrough of the Year 10 years ago in 2009.</p>
      <p>Building up to the breakthrough, Home’s team had used ultracold ions to demonstrate separately all of the steps needed for quantum computation – initializing the qubits; storing them in ions; performing a logic operation on one or two qubits; transferring the information between different locations in the processor; and reading out the qubit results individually. But in 2009, the group made the crucial breakthrough of combining all these stages onto a single device. Home’s set-up had an overall accuracy of 94% – impressive for a quantum device – but not good enough to be used in a large-scale quantum computer.</p>
      <p>At the time, the field of quantum computing was very much in its infancy and more work needed to be done before they could become a commercial reality. Since Home’s work  researchers have made a number of big steps forward in quantum computing including <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/computer-architecture-recreated-on-quantum-device/">the first implementation of a quantum version of the “Von Neumann” architecture found in personal computers</a>, <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/how-to-make-a-tougher-quantum-computer/">making quantum computers more robust</a> as well as <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/ion-trap-quantum-computer-is-programmable-and-reconfigurable/">programmable and reconfigurable</a>.</p>

      <p>Several major technology firms have entered the field or ramped up their efforts too – notably Google, Microsoft and IBM – while the Canadian firm D-Wave Systems has been selling quantum computers with an increasing number of “quantum bits”, or qubits. Its latest model having 2000.</p>
      <p>The most recent and – to date – highest-profile result was the <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/google-reports-quantum-supremacy-in-draft-paper/">announcement</a> in October that Google had used a 53-qubit quantum computer to reach “quantum supremacy” – a term to denote that a quantum computer can solve a problem in a significantly shorter time than a conventional (classical) computer. Although, Google’s machine outperformed a classical computer on a very specific problem, the move marked a major milestone for the field.</p>
      <p>A decade on from the world’s first quantum computer on a chip, we have now entered the era of quantum supremacy or “quantum advantage” as some would rather have it. The coming decade promises to be equally exciting.</p>
