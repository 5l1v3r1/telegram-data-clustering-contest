      <h1>Black Widow: Scarlett Johansson Explains Why She Returned for the Film</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-widow-movie/"><i>Black Widow</i></a> star Scarlett Johansson revealed her personal expectations for her first solo movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She explained that, if the story hadn't impressed her, she would have been content to walk away from Marvel following <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-endgame/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a>.</p>
      <p>"I did not want it to be an origin story," Johansson told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/scarlett-johansson-oscars-issue-cover-story">Vanity Fair</a>. "I did not want it to be an espionage story. I didn't want it to feel superficial at all. I only wanted to do it if it actually fit where I was with that character. I had spent such a long time peeling those layers away -- I felt that unless we got to something deep, then there was no reason to make it. Because I did my job in <i>Endgame,</i> and actually felt satisfied with that. I would have been happy to let that be it. So there had to be a reason to do it other than just to milk something."</p>

      <p>Johansson has played the titular character throughout her tenure in the MCU, with Black Widow making the ultimate sacrifice in <i>Endgame.</i> Her actions not only saved Hawkeye but also assisted the rest of the Avengers in their mission to stop Thanos.</p>
      <p>The upcoming solo movie will be a prequel set before <i>Endgame</i> and is expected to take place after <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, following Natasha "Black Widow" Romanoff in a story that forces her to confront her past.</p>
