      <p>A man has been jailed after stealing alcohol and gift sets worth £15,000 from airlines - and stuffed them into his small home.</p>
      <p>Eduard Caia, 28, was a warehouse cleaner for in-flight catering company Alpha LSG and managed to rack up £10,000 from online sales of stolen items.</p>
      <p>Footage from inside Caia’s home in Hounslow shows boxes, alcohol and gift sets stacked and stashed in every crevice of the house.</p>
      <p>Investigating officer PC Tom Blair described the home as ‘unlivable’ due to the astonishing amount of stolen products.</p>
      <p>Caia was investigated after an employee spotted the branded kits being flogged on eBay.</p>
      <p>Isleworth Crown Court heard how the security team at Alpha LSG emailed the seller pretending to be interested in the goods.</p>

      <p>The team struck up a conversation with the seller and became confident that the thief was Caia.</p>
      <p>Officers from the Metropolitan Police arrested Caia at the warehouse on 18 October 2017.</p>

      <p>1,700 amenity kits worth £8,680 were stolen, along with 700 bottles and cans of alcohol worth more than £4,000.</p>
      <p>Caia also pinched a stack of pyjamas and slippers worth £1,175 from the company.</p>

      <p>A stash of £1,700 cash found in a bedroom drawer was also seized by officers.</p>
      <p>Investigating officer, PC Tom Blair, of the Met’s Aviation Policing Command, said: “Caia was set to make more money selling all that was left in his house, but he didn’t count on the tight-knit relationship of the airlines, his own employers and the police.</p>
      <p>“I really must applaud Alpha LSG who wasted no time in launching an internal investigation once they suspected a staff member of criminality.</p>
      <p>“This case is evidence of how seriously this kind of crime is treated by businesses working at Heathrow Airport and the police.”</p>

      <p>On Friday, 25 October, Caia pleaded guilty to one count of theft and one count of acquiring criminal property over the period 18 October 2016 to 18 October 2017.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced on Thursday, 28 November to a total of 21 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Following the sentencing, officers will instigate proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to the £10,000 he made from selling the stolen goods.</p>
