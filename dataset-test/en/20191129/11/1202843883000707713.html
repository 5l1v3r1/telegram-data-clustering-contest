      <p>Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD) has signed a $4.2m grant agreement with the Government of Jordan to contribute to the financing of Jordan Refugee Health Fund in order to alleviate financial pressures on the Jordanian Ministry of Health budget as a result of the large influx of refugees.</p>
      <p>With this agreement, Qatar Fund for Development joins the Multi Donor Account (MDA), which includes the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of Denmark and the Government of Canada, as well as the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) with the possibility of joining other donors.</p>
      <p>The agreement was signed by Director General of QFFD, Khalifa bin Jassem Al Kuwari, and Minister of Planning and International Cooperation on behalf of the Government of Jordan Dr. Wissam Al Rabadi.</p>
      <p>The meeting was attended by Minister of Health of Jordan Dr. Saad Jaber; Ambassador of the State of Qatar to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Sheikh Saud bin Nasser Al Thani, and QFFD delegation. On this occasion, Director General of QFFD Khalifa bin Jassem Al Kuwari stressed that the State of Qatar is one of the countries that support the Syrian people in this crisis through QFFD, which supports many human development, health, education and economic empowerment projects.</p>
      <p>He expressed his hope that these contributions will reduce the burden on the brotherly Syrian people and pledged to continue this support based on the directives issued for Qatar Fund for Development in this regard from the Government of the State of Qatar.</p>
      <p>For his part, the Jordanian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation appreciated the contribution of QFFD to the Jordanian health fund for refugees. He pointed out that hosting more than one million three hundred thousand Syrian refugees in Jordan has a great impact on all sectors and services provided by the government, where Jordan is a model to be followed in terms of receiving refugees and sharing resources with them.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the signing of this agreement is of great importance as it is the first agreement establishing development cooperation between the Fund and the Ministry. He expressed his hope to develop cooperation and bilateral work to achieve economic and social development.</p>
      <p>He added that the strategy of QFFD is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, noting that the Fund has a wide portfolio of financial instruments to provide external assistance including grants, loans and development investments, in addition to having wide partnerships at the national and international levels.</p>
      <p>The Jordanian minister praised the bilateral relations between the two countries, expressing the Jordanian government’s appreciation to Qatar Fund for Development for this support.</p>
