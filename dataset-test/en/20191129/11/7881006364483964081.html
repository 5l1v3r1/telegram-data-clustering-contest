      <p><b>Bengaluru:</b> Police have booked former chief ministers Siddaramaiah and H D Kumaraswamy along with the then Bengaluru police commissioner T Sunil Kumar, his subordinates and some Congress and JD(S) leaders on sedition charges for protesting the income tax raids during Lok Sabha polls.</p>
      <p>Based on a complaint by activist Mallikarjuna A, a city court recently directed the commercial street police to register a case under various sections of the IPC including criminal conspiracy and attempting or abetting waging war against the Government of India.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The case relates to protests near the I-T office here by the leaders including the then Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy against the Income Tax raids at the residence of Congress and JD(S) leaders.</p>
      <p>The charges are that Kumaraswamy had informed public about the possible raids after getting inputs about the action.</p>
      <p>Kumaraswamy had told the media on March 27 that there was every likelihood of raids as a large number of central security forces had arrived at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).</p>
      <p>His apprehensions came true the next day as the forces fanned out to different parts of the state. Later, a massive demonstration was conducted at the Income Tax office.</p>
      <p>Other prominent people, who have been booked, include then deputy chief minister G Parameshwara, D K Shivakumar, Congress state chief Dinesh Gundu Rao, the then deputy commissioners of police Rahul Kumar, D Devaraju and all election officers.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the sedition charges, D K Shivakumar said all the cases were politically motivated and he will fight it politically.</p>
      <p>"We did not enter the income tax office. We stood 150 metres away and raised slogans," he added.</p>
