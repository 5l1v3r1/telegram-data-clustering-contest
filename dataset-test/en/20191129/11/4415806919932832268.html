      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:24:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A respite centre for people with disabilities will close today with the loss of 48 jobs.</p>
      <p>The Irish Wheelchair Association (IWA) is shutting the Cuisle centre in Donamon in Co Roscommon because of funding issues.</p>
      <p>More than 1,500 people protested against the plans last weekend but the IWA confirmed it will close today.</p>
      <p>Campaigner Martin Finan says the centre has been a huge asset for the past 20 years.</p>
      <p>"We're disappointed that today the centre is closing down, we are very disappointed with the Irish Wheelchair Association," said Mr Finan.</p>
      <p>"We put a lot of pressure on them to change their minds but unfortunately they haven't done that.</p>
      <p>"It is a very sad day for Roscommon and it's a very sad day for Cuisle."</p>
      <p>Mr Finan said that the fight will continue and that campaigners will be meeting next week.</p>
      <p>"We will have to look and see if there are alternatives once the centre closes today.</p>
      <p>"We will have to see what alternatives there might be already in place.</p>
      <p>"We could see if other service users be willing to come in and run the service?"</p>
