      <h1>W Resources begins tungsten and tin production at La Parrilla mine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:35:15+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mining-technology.com/author/ghimaja/" target="_blank">Himaja</a></address>
      <p>W Resources has commenced tungsten and tin concentrate production for sale at its La Parrilla mine in Spain.</p>
      <p>La Parrilla is located approximately 310km southwest of Madrid, and is in close proximity to both Atlantic and Mediterranean ports.</p>
      <p>The commencement of production at the mine is a major milestone in the T2 ramp-up phase of La Parrilla.</p>
      <p>This will enable the company to achieve its targeted 2Mtpa of run-of-mine, with the aim of producing 2,700t of WO<sub>3</sub> concentrate.</p>
      <p>W Resources noted that the tungsten and tin concentrate production aligns with the specifications of La Parrilla standard concentrate.</p>
      <p>Until now, the grade of the tungsten concentrate has met shipment criteria levels, which is likely to improve further as and when the plant achieves steady-state production.</p>
      <p>Customers will receive the first shipment from the new concentrator next month.</p>
      <p>W Resources chairman Michael Masterman said: “We have now reached this significant milestone at La Parrilla as we commence commercial tungsten and tin production and have achieved stable operating plant performance.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased with initial concentrate production grades, which we anticipate will continue to improve as we move up the ramp-up curve and transition to 24-hour plant operations in December.”</p>
      <p>The company added that mining and crushing operations are underway, having completed its recent blast of 90,000t of ore and rock at La Parrilla.</p>
      <p>Recently, W Resources reported <a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/news/w-resources-commissions-concentrator-plant/">concentrator plant commissioning</a> and funding at the mine.</p>
      <p>In June, the company <a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/news/w-resources-contract-la-parrilla-project/">awarded a mining contract to General de Maquinaria y Excavación (GME)</a> for La Parrilla.</p>
