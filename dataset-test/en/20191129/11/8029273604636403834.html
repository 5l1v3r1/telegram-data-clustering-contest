      <p>Vitabon said it has filed the lawsuit with the Seoul Central District Court, demanding 110 million won ($93,000) in compensation and that manufacturing and sales of glo sens be banned in the country.</p>
      <p>"Despite the fact that Vitabon Sense is a product designed to help customers quit smoking and glo sens is an e-cigarette product, the methods of use are very similar and their customer bases very close," a Vitabon official said. "Vitabon Sense was also released prior to glo sens."</p>
      <p>BAT Korea said it plans to file a countersuit against Vitabon, saying that the names of the two products are not confusing to consumers at all. (Yonhap)</p>
