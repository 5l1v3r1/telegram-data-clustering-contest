      <p>Amazon was targeted by a UK-wide protest organised to coincide with Black Friday and Cyber Monday demanding an end to ‘appalling’ working conditions.</p>
      <p>In another blow, hundreds of employees at distribution centres across Germany walked out amid a long-simmering battle for better pay.</p>
      <p>Trade union GMB co-ordinated the British demonstrations to take place across two of the busiest shopping days of the year.</p>
      <p>‘Workers are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,’ GMB national officer Mick Rix said in a statement.</p>
      <p>‘Amazon has spent a fortune on fluffy adverts saying what a great place it is to work. Why not spend the money making their warehouses less dangerous places to work?’</p>

      <p>The union cited figures suggesting there had been more than 600 ambulance call-outs to Amazon warehouses over a three-year period and just as many serious incidents reported to the Health and Safety Executive for various injuries.</p>

      <p>They also claimed workers had to urinate in water bottles and said there had been at least one report of a lost pregnancy, <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/black-friday-amazon-warehouse-strikes-094422377.html?guccounter=1">Yahoo!</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn visited protestors outside Amazon’s Sheffield centre to show his support earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader was joined by the party’s local candidate Jack Dromey, who later criticised the company on Twitter.</p>

      <p>But an Amazon spokesperson blasted ‘self-interested critics’ with ‘a vested interest in spreading misinformation’ in a statement, adding that ‘the facts tell a different story’.</p>
      <p>‘The truth is that Amazon already offers industry-leading pay, comprehensive benefits, as well as a safe, modern work environment,’ the said.</p>
      <p>‘These groups are conjuring misinformation to work in their favour, when in fact we already offer the things they claim to be fighting for.’</p>
      <p>Amazon workers in Germany marked Black Friday by going on strike for better pay.</p>
      <p>Union ver.di announced that the walkouts would affect six distribution centres across the country, with some due to last until Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Representative Orhan Akman said staff want to send a signal that their work can’t be bought with the kind of extreme discounts offered by the online retail giant around this time of the year.</p>

      <p>He also accused the company of putting ‘extreme pressure’ on staff that has caused some to fall ill.</p>
      <p>Amazon responded that ‘packages are arriving punctually, because the bulk of employees is dealing completely normally with customers’ orders today’.</p>
      <p>It added that it offers pay ‘at the upper end of comparable jobs’ and other benefits.</p>
      <p>In Paris, climate activists blocked one of the company’s warehouses in protest at the over-production which they say is killing the planet.</p>
      <p>Some French lawmakers wish to ban the shopping event altogether.</p>
