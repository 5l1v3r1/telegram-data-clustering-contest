      <h1>Amon Amarth review – beserkers, sea serpents and catchy death metal</h1>

        <i><b>Academy, Birmingham</b><br/>Over heavy riffs and double kick drums, the folklore-obsessed Swedish band deliver a thundering theatrical spectacle</i>
      </p>
      <p>Vikings are invading again, although this time they arrive in a tour bus, not in longships. Sweden’s Amon Amarth (an Elvish name for Mount Doom, courtesy of JRR Tolkien) have been crafting Viking-themed metal since 1992, but after 11 albums they can fill good-sized venues such as this one. Their songs deliver tales of Viking folklore, wars, wolves, Norse gods and berserkers (elite Viking warriors who wore animal pelts, not armour) over a soundtrack of brutal but melodic and passionate death metal. Drummer Jocke Wallgren sits atop an enormous horned helmet.</p>
      <p>With their long hair, thick beards, tattoos and leather accessories, the quintet cannot be accused of not looking the part. Vocalist Johan Hegg – a sort of gravel-voiced, metal Grizzly Adams – has a drinking horn attached to his belt and would make a convincing exhibit in Jorvik, York’s Viking museum. “Are you ready to do battle with me?” he roars.</p>

      <p>The band have presumably pillaged Iron Maiden’s suppliers for theatrics. A giant, green-eyed, horned berserker brandishes a ram’s skull on a spear. Swordsmen do battle with huge shields. There are steam cannons and loud bangs. At one point, Hegg even mimics rowing a boat, prompting one lively couple to sit down and do the same. The music – powered along by Wallgren’s double kick-drum thunder – is relentless, but Olavi Mikkonen and Johan Söderberg’s twin guitar attack certainly delivers tunes. They don’t exactly have massive crossover potential, but the riff-heavy Guardians of Asgaard and Shield Wall are certainly catchy. Hegg leads a call and response routine and isn’t beyond sending himself up: “It doesn’t matter if you don’t know the lyrics – it’s death metal!” The band members all raise drinking horns full of beer for, well, Raise Your Horns, then Hegg wields a huge rubber mallet to do battle with a giant sea serpent three times his size. It’s a silly way to make a living, but it looks like it is an enjoyable job.</p>
