      <p>BORIS Johnson has defended disparaging remarks he made about single mothers, telling a voter they were made before he was "even in politics".</p>
      <p>An article written by the Conservative Party leader for the Spectator magazine in 1995 has been unearthed in which he described the children of single mothers as "ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate".</p>
      <p>In the column, the British Prime Minister said it was "outrageous" that married couples "should pay for 'the single mothers' desire to procreate independently of men".</p>
      <p>During a phone-in on LBC radio on Friday, Mr Johnson was put to task over the comments by a single mother named Ruth from Oldham.</p>
      <p>She told the PM she was unhappy about the content of the article and questioned why he was reluctant to talk about his own family.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: "Ruth, I want to say to you, I mean absolutely no disrespect to you or anybody.</p>
      <p>"These are 25-year-old quotations culled from articles written I think before I was even in politics."</p>
      <p>He said the quotes were stripped of context and formed part of a smear campaign by Labour.</p>
      <p>"They're just trying to distract from the reality that they have no plan to get out of the EU."</p>
      <p>During the call-in, Mr Johnson also:</p>
      <p>- Gave a "guarantee" to take Britain out of the European Union by January 31 if he secures a "workable" majority.</p>
      <p>- Said the £58 billion (€68bn) compensation for Waspi women promised by Labour was "a lot of money".</p>
      <p>- Confirmed he would "walk out" of trade talks with the US if President Donald Trump wanted the NHS to be on the table.</p>
      <p>- Told voters he wanted to come back with a "better answer" to the social care funding crisis - but said the politics had to be taken "out of this".</p>
      <p>- Refused to discuss how many children he has, telling LBC: "I love my children very much but they're not standing at this election."</p>
      <p>- Admitted his new nurses pledge amounted to 31,000 extra nurses in the NHS - not 50,000.</p>
