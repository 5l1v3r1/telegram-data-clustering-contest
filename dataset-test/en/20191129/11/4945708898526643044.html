      <p>Singapore authorities Friday ordered Facebook to correct an article on a fringe news site containing "scurrilous accusations" of election rigging, ramping up their use of a controversial law against misinformation.</p>
      <p>The social media giant, which has previously expressed concerns about the legislation, did not respond to requests for comment and the article was still on the site without any changes.</p>
      <p>The order is a test of the new law, which gives ministers powers to tell platforms to put warnings next to posts authorities deem false, but which activists fear could be used to curb <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/free+speech/">free speech</a>.</p>
      <p>On Thursday authorities ordered Alex Tan, who runs anti-government website the States Times Review, to put up a correction next to a November 23 post on elections.</p>
      <p>But Tan—who is based overseas—refused, saying he is an Australian citizen and would not comply with requests from a "foreign government".</p>
      <p>A body overseeing the law then said it had ordered Facebook to put up a "correction notice" by the article, which would link to a statement on the government's own fact-checking site.</p>
      <p>That statement said that Tan's <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/article/">article</a>, which claims elections are rigged in Singapore to ensure the ruling party stays in power, contained "false statements of fact" and "made scurrilous accusations".</p>
      <p>The increased use of the law comes as speculation mounts that elections could be called within months, although a weak opposition is seen as no match for the long-ruling People's Action Party.</p>
      <p>Singapore used the law for the first time Monday, ordering opposition party member Brad Bowyer to correct a Facebook post authorities said could "smear the reputation" of two state investment funds.</p>
      <p>Bowyer—a naturalised Singapore citizen originally from Britain—immediately complied.</p>
      <p>Facebook, a major investor in Singapore, has its Asia headquarters in the city-state and last year announced plans to build a $1 billion data centre there.</p>
      <p>Despite the concerns, Singapore's government, which regularly faces criticism for curbing civil liberties, insists the legislation is necessary to stop the spread of damaging falsehoods online.</p>
