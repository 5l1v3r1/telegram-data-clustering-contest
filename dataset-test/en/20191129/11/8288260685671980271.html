      <h1>Photo showcase of Shirley Park to encourage more families to visit</h1>
      <h2>Local group of volunteers have launched a 2020 calendar as part of their drive to promote the "oasis of wildlife" and tackle negative perceptions about the Green Flag site.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:13:46+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author">David Irwin, https://www.facebook.com/David-Irwin-Local-Democracy-Reporter-792811574238027/?ref=settings</a></address>
      <p>Shirley residents have come up with a novel new way of getting people into their local park.</p>
      <p>A calendar, which showcases the Green Flag site through the seasons, has been produced using a selection of pictures taken over the course of 12 months.</p>
      <p>Friends of Shirley Park hope the photos will challenge negative perceptions and persuade more people to pay a visit.</p>
      <p>Proceeds could also boost funds towards an ambitious plan to create an outdoor classroom within the open space.</p>

      <p>Helena Morrissey, the group's chair, said that the park was an "oasis of wildlife" and members were keen to show it at its best.</p>
      <p>"People probably think of the play area and the sports pitches but they don't necessarily think about the nature or the beauty ... that we have in the heart of the community," she told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).</p>
      <p>"If people go by what they read about kids that are hanging about they are not going to go, but if they see how lovely it actually is they may just go and have a look."</p>
      <p>A misty morning in winter, a pathway brimming with wisteria and an image of the park's war memorial are included in the snapshots.</p>
      <p>Some 150 calendars have been printed with help from local estate agents Martin and Co and it is hoped that a 2021 edition could follow - with even more photos submitted.</p>

      <p>Profits from this first effort could go towards the classroom plan, which Ms Morrissey admits will be "expensive" but is also part of the push to have the park as a community hub and get more young people involved.</p>
      <p>The Friends, who work closely with the council's Love Solihull team, have also received a boost from news they will receive almost £8,000 from the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to install new picnic benches.</p>
      <p>The calendar will be on sale at the Shirley Christmas lights switch-on, which will be taking place on Sunday, December 1. The event will run from 3-4.30pm, with local comedian Malcolm Stent flipping the switch at 4pm.</p>
      <p>Residents can also order a copy (for £6) via the group's Facebook page or by emailing <a href="mailto:friendsofshirleypark@outlook.com">friendsofshirleypark@outlook.com</a></p>
