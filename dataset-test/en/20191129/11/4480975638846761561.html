      <h3>EUR/GBP remains focused on the UK elections</h3>
      <p>The European cross maintains the bearish bias in the area of 6-month lows around the 0.8500 mark, mainly in response to the persistent cautious/selling stance from the euro while the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">sterling</a> found further excuses to keep the positive bias on speculations that the Tory party could win majority at the upcoming general elections.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the cross is about to close its fourth consecutive month with losses, almost fully reversing the May-August impressive rally that started at as low as 0.8488 and met strong hurdle in the area just beyond 0.9300 the figure (August 12<sup>th</sup>).</p>
      <p>In the docket, German Retail Sales contracted nearly 2.0% MoM during October while the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">unemployment rate</a> came in unchanged at 5.0% for the current month. Moving to the euro area, flash inflation figures now see headline consumer prices rising 1.0% YoY and 1.3% YoY when comes to prices excluding food and energy costs.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the Channel, BoE’s Consumer Credit expanded more than expected £1.326 billion during October and Net Lending to Individuals rose to £5.6 billion in the same period. Further UK data saw Mortgage Approvals shrinking a tad to 64.6K units last month.</p>
      <h4>EUR/GBP key levels</h4>
      <p>The cross is advancing 0.01% at 0.8525 and faces the next barrier at 0.8605 (high Nov.22) seconded by 0.8667 (78.6% Fibo of the May-August rally) and then 0.8676 (high Oct.24). On the other hand, a breach of 0.8499 (monthly low Nov.28) would expose 0.8488 (monthly low May 6) and finally 0.8471 (2019 low Mar.13).</p>
