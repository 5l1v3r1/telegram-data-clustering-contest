      <p>Earlier today we released the list of the<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/29/best-camera-phones-of-2019/"> best camera phones</a> of 2019 according to renown camera-focused website <i>DxOMark</i>. Now, we’ll be doing the same but this time it’s all about the front sensors. So, let’s have a look at the best selfie camera phones of the year!</p>

      <p>Just like in the previous list, we start with the device that won the “Best all-rounder” award. In this case it’s the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G which according to <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/the-best-smartphone-front-cameras-of-2019/"><i>DxOMark</i></a> has what it takes in the front camera department. The device achieved a total score of 99 points, which is the best by a mile, exception made for the ASUS ZenFone 6 that sits at 98. The next non-Samsung device is indeed the Huawei Mate 30 Pro at 93, while Google’s Pixel 4 only got 92 points.</p>
      <p>How did the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G achieve the 99 score? Well, the handset showed an excellent performance across most categories, making it the best choice for different type of selfies and under various light conditions. Additionally, Samsung’s phone does particularly well with artificial bokeh mode and in flash mode.</p>
      <p>The next award we find on the website is the “Best for video”. Here the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G dominated the category with the best video footage recorded on the front camera. The smartphone was indeed able to record high quality 4K video with excellent details in bright light and under typical indoor conditions. In low light, while losing some texture, it still fared better than the competition.</p>
      <h3>Best Selfie Camera Phones of 2019 Listed by DxOMark</h3>

      <p>The latest Google Pixel 4 also managed to get some awards, the first being for “Best for Travel”. Albeit this category sounds somewhat subjective, the explanation behind this pick is very logical. Pixel 4’s front camera has a wider depth of field, which means its easier to have the person and the background both on focus. While other smartphones with a shallow depth of field may only focus on one of the two; thus losing details.</p>
      <p>The not-too-popular Asus ZenFone 6 did instead win the “Best for close-up portraits” award. The ZenFone 6 is indeed able to put the subject perfectly on focus no matter the distance due to the presence of a flagship-grade sensor at the front (the rear camera can be tilted). This means the smartphone is ideal to snap close-up selfies.</p>

      <p>Finally, we have the “Best for group portraits” awards which goes to the Pixel 4. The 21mm equivalent front camera does, in fact, allow users to capture a wider field of view. This, along with the wider depth of field, makes the Pixel 4 the best phone to snap selfies with a large number of people as they’ll all fit in the frame and they’ll be on focus as well.</p>
