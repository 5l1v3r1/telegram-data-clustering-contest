      <p>Not everyone is a fan of Thanksgiving Day sales.</p>
      <p>Over the past few days, angry shoppers on Twitter have complained about the retailers that have chosen to open stores early for Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>According to BestBlackFriday.com, at least 19 retailers including Macy’s, JCPenney, and Best Buy are scheduled to be open over the holiday. Most of these stores plan to open in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Thanksgiving is a day of giving thanks, not a day for corporate capitalism,” one person wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/OrlyPhillips">Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>“Opening your stores on Thanksgiving is UNAMERICAN,” another <a href="https://twitter.com/hikerpal">wrote</a>. “It is a truly disgusting practice to make people work on one of the truly American holidays. Shame on your money-grubbing ways.”</p>

      <p>At least 35 retailers won’t be opening for Thanksgiving this year, however, amid evidence this shopping day <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-is-dead-because-of-discounting-2018-10">doesn’t carry the same weight it once did</a>. As consumers are increasingly shopping for deals online, they feel less of a need to line up outside stores for one big day of shopping. Moreover, they’re used to having deals year-round, which takes the pressure off Black Friday.</p>
