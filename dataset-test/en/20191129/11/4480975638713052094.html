      <p>Analysts at TD Securities (TDS) offered a brief preview of Friday's only important release of the Canadian GDP growth figures, scheduled later during the early North-American session.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>"Canadian GDP could spark some real fireworks, as a miss to the downside would pave the way for a large rally in Canada ahead of the BoC <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> meeting next week."</p>
      <p>"We look for Q3 GDP to rise by a muted 0.9%, slightly below the market consensus and Bank of Canada projections for 1.3%. Softer net exports will weigh on growth along with muted non-residential investment growth, while strong residential investment and a rebound in consumption will provide the main drivers to growth. For industry-level GDP, we look for a 0.1% increase in September (market: 0.1%) to provide a soft handoff to the fourth quarter, with manufacturing headwinds weighing on monthly GDP growth."</p>
