      <p>Xiaomi’s next value-flagship and its tantalising 120hz display featuring S10+ reminiscent camera cutout is now mere days away with the official launch set for December 10th.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> and their fellow Chinese technology brands have been chasing up the value game with a new category of ‘value-flagship’ and ‘sub-flagship’ smartphones offering flagship or near-flagship specs and features, respectively, for much more reasonable prices than their <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/apple">Apple</a>, <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a>, and <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/huawei">Huawei</a> contenders.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi launched their own wipeout offensive on both categories with their newly offshot sub-brand <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/redmi-k20">Redmi’s K20</a> and <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/redmi-k20-pro">K20 Pro</a>, known as the <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/mi-9t">Mi 9T</a> and <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/mi-9t-pro">9T Pro</a> globally, earlier this year, offering a full suite of cameras, bezelless display and popup camera, and excellent sub-flagc<i>hip</i> Snapdragon 730 or full-flag<i>chip</i> Snapdragon 855 respectively, at very attractive $300US and $400US base prices.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-9t-redmi-k20/">They are still excellent phones these five months later</a>, however even in only that half-year since the phones debuted great steps forward in mobile technology have continued to develop, namely in the display refresh-rate technologies with Redmi K20 Pro competition like <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/oppo">Oppo‘s</a> <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/realme-x2-pro">Realme X2 Pro</a> sporting a 90hz display (vs the standard 60hz); while the only 120hz AMOLED so far has been found in the <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/rog-phone-2">ASUS ROG Phone II</a>.</p>
      <p>We now know that Xiaomi will be chasing that smoothness trend themselves with their upcoming Redmi K30 (Mi 10T? Mi 10X? Mi 9+?…) and its presumed ‘Pro’ variant, and today Xiaomi has announced that the phone(s) will see their launch in just over a week on December 10th.</p>
      <p>With the announcement teaser image Xiaomi has also reconfirmed that there will be a <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/5g">5G</a> variant of the Redmi K30 launching in January, when the entire K30 series had previously been teased to launch, and Xiaomi claims it to be a ‘5G Pioneer’ at a reasonable price.</p>
      <p>We’ll have to wait a few more days for all the details though so stay tuned to <a href="http://talkandroid.com/">Talk Android</a>!</p>
