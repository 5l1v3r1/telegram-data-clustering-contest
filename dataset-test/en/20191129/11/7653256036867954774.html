      <p>KABUL: The Taliban said Friday it was "way too early" to speak of resuming direct talks with Washington, a day after President <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Donald-Trump">Donald Trump</a> suggested negotiations to end America's longest war were back on track during a surprise visit to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
      <p>The statement from insurgent spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid sounded a note of caution after Trump said during a lightning visit to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bagram-Airfield">Bagram Airfield</a> Thursday that the Taliban "wants to make a deal".</p>
      <p>"We're meeting with them and we're saying it has to be a ceasefire," he told reporters during the visit to mark the Thanksgiving holiday with troops at the base.</p>
      <p>His statement indicated progress, though Mujahid's suggested roadblocks remain.</p>
      <p>"It is way too early to talk about the resumption of talks for now," the insurgent spokesman told AFP in a WhatsApp message, adding that the Islamist group would give an official reaction later.</p>
      <p>In September the US and the Taliban had appeared on the verge of signing a deal that would have seen Washington begin pulling troops out of Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.</p>
      <p>It was also expected to pave the way towards direct talks between the Taliban and the government in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kabul">Kabul</a>.</p>
      <p>But that month Trump abruptly called the year-long effort "dead", and withdrew an invitation to the insurgents to meet in the United States due to the killing of an American soldier.</p>
      <p>"We were getting close and we pulled back. We didn't want to do it because of what they did," Trump said at Bagram during a meeting with Afghan president <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashraf-Ghani">Ashraf Ghani</a>, referring to the death of the soldier.</p>
      <p>"Since then, we've hit them so hard, they've never been hit this hard," he added.</p>
      <p>Most observers agree that a political settlement is the only way towards a lasting peace in Afghanistan, and since September diplomatic efforts to foster dialogue have continued.</p>
      <p>The Taliban last week handed over two hostages -- an American and an Australian -- after three years in captivity in exchange for three high-ranking insurgent prisoners, a move seen as a boost to resuming negotiations.</p>
      <p>About 13,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan, 18 years after the United States invaded following the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>
      <p>Trump said he planned to reduce the number to 8,600, and later added "we can go much further than that," without giving details.</p>
      <p>The president also said Thursday the war in Afghanistan "will not be decided on the battlefield" and that "ultimately there will need to be a political solution" decided by people in the region.</p>
      <p>The insurgents have long refused to talk to Kabul, however, declaring the administration a "puppet" of the US.</p>
      <p>A simmering political crisis over the most recent Afghan presidential election will not help.</p>
      <p>The September 28 poll has already been marred by a record-low turnout and bickering between the incumbent, Ghani, and his chief rival, Abdullah Abdullah.</p>
      <p>Two months later, election officials have not yet released even a preliminary count. Without a result, it is not yet clear whether it will be Ghani or Abdullah who eventually faces the militants across the negotiating table.</p>
      <p>A ceasefire could also be part of the delay. "That would be a major shift in policy. Violence is leverage for the Taliban," tweeted the Wilson Center's <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/South-Asia">South Asia</a> analyst Michael Kugelman.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, ordinary Afghans continue to bear the brunt of the conflict, with more civilians killed in 2018 than during any other year on record, according to the United Nations.</p>
