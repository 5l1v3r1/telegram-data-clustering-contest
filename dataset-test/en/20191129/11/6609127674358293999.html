      <p>The member of staff was left shaken after the incident but had no injuries.</p>
      <p>The first man is described between 5ft 7in and 5ft 10in in height with a medium build.</p>
      <p>He was wearing a navy coloured puffer coat, dark tracksuit trousers and white trainers.</p>
      <p>He spoke with a local accent and was wearing a black face mask in an effort to conceal his identity.</p>
      <p>The second culprit is also between 5ft 7in and 5ft 10in in height.</p>
      <p>He was wearing a grey hooded top with a Celtic scarf covering his face.</p>
      <p>He spoke with a local accent and was carrying a blue Smyths Toys bag.</p>
      <p>Officers are in the process of collecting CCTV footage for review and are carrying out door-to-door enquiries in the area.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Gary McEwan added:  “This store is popular with the local community as well as morning commuters coming into and leaving Paisley.</p>
      <p>"I am asking people who were around at the time of the crime to think back and consider if they noticed anything suspicious or unusual?</p>
      <p>"If you have a dash cam, please check the footage as it may have captured the suspects at the garage before committing the crime.</p>
      <p>"Any small piece of information could be vital as we piece together the circumstances of this crime.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call CID officers at Paisley Police Station via 101, quoting incident number 0585 of Friday, 29 November, 2019.</p>
