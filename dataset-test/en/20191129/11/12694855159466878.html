      <h1>The iPhone X has been price-slashed by £260 − but the offer ends soon</h1>

        <b>Amazon has brought the price of the 64GB iPhone X (SIM-free) down by a whopping £260 for Black Friday, which means you can get your hands on it for just £639 − that’s a 29% discount. This deal only applies to the silver model, and it expires at midnight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I know what you’re thinking − the iPhone X is no longer one of Apple’s very latest mobiles. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t still a very good handset. And at this price it’s a very tempting purchase indeed.</p>
      <p>We continually check thousands of prices to show you the best deals. If you buy a product through our site we will earn a small commission from the retailer – a sort of automated referral fee – but our reviewers are always kept separate from this process.

      <p>The iPhone X came out in November 2017 (back then it would have set you back £999), and it was Apple’s flagship iPhone until the iPhone XS’ release a year ago. Both models have now been superseded by the iPhone 11 range.</p>
      <p>However, despite being two years old the iPhone X is far from outdated. First off, it looks almost identical to Apple’s current flagship. But more importantly, its specs and features are not to be sniffed at either. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5.8-inch OLED HDR display</li>
        <li>A11 Bionic CPU</li>
        <li>Face ID</li>
        <li>Dual 12-megapixel camera with OIS</li>
        <li>IP67</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Crucially, Apple has bumped the iPhone X to iOS 13, a software update that has given it a new lease of life, adding dark mode and a much-improved Apple Maps to the mix. Better still, there’s a good chance it will get iOS 14 next year.</p>

      <p>If you want an iPhone but don’t mind a former flagship rather than the latest and greatest that Apple has to offer, this is a deal that’s well worth your consideration.</p>
