      <p>Former England captain Rooney officially joined the Sky Bet Championship side as player-coach this week and will be in the Pride Park dugout to watch Saturday's clash with QPR.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, who left MLS outfit DC United in October and has agreed an 18-month deal, will be ineligible to represent <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/phillip-cocu/"><b>Phillip Cocu</b></a>'s side until the winter transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>Rams supporters have already chanted Rooney's name at matches and he shares that excitement ahead of a potential first appearance against Barnsley on January 2.</p>
      <p>"(I am) really looking forward to it. I've watched most of the games. It will be nice to get to Pride Park and meet the supporters," Rooney told Rams TV.</p>

      <p>"It's been a long time since it was announced that I'd joined the club, so it will be nice for me but also for the fans.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully I can give the players and the fans a lift. It's always exciting when you join a new club but when you get to meet the fans for the first time, it will be a nice feeling.</p>
      <p>"I've heard them at games singing my name and different things so I think it's great for all of us. Hopefully it can help us push on. It's an exciting time.</p>
      <p>"It's great just to be back around all the lads and the frustrating part of it will be training all week and not playing at the weekend."</p>
      <p>Derby reached the play-off final under Frank Lampard last season but have endured an unconvincing start under his successor Cocu.</p>

      <p>The 14th-placed Rams sit six points off the top six and have not won away in the league since the opening weekend of the season.</p>
      <p>Rooney, record goalscorer for his country and Manchester United, believes greater consistency is required for his new club to push for promotion.</p>
      <p>"The lads seem like a very good dressing room. I've been around the lads for a couple of weeks before I went away," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was important that I came in and got to know the players a bit more as well and over the next month I'll have time to do that on a day-to-day basis.</p>
      <p>"Home form has been really good, away form not so great. I think if we can try and pick up a few more points – pick up any points at the minute away from home – that will be great and will really help us.</p>

      <p>"I feel if we can win two or three games on the bounce, it will put us in a good position and get us closer to the play-off spots."</p>
      <p>Rooney will have gone more than two months without first-team action by the time of the Barnsley match but has little concern about his fitness.</p>
      <p>"I'll keep myself topped up and just make sure I'm ready to come straight in come the Barnsley game," he said.</p>
      <p>"Not so long ago I was playing so it won't be as tough as a full pre-season and I'll do a lot of football training with the team so I don't think it will be so bad."</p>
