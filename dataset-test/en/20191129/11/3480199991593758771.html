      <p>For performance cars, 150mph is a magic speed barrier that carries some real heft. It takes a lot for a car to achieve this, after all, with years of tuning and mechanical advancement behind each vehicle which manages to hit this holy grail of speed.</p>
      <p>But quite often cracking 150mph comes with a premium. That said, you’d be surprised by how many 150mph-capable cars are available on the used market, with several sitting at the £15,000 mark. As a disclaimer, never try and hit 150mph on a public road. If you’re trying to reach high speeds, always do it where it’s safe and, most importantly, legal to do so.</p>
      <h3>Volkswagen Golf R</h3>

      <p>&gt;<br/>Volkswagen’s supercar-beating Golf R delivered a hammer blow to the hot hatch segment when it arrived, delivering four-wheel-drive security backed by a punchy 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine.</p>
      <p>Plus, it’s rated to a top speed of 155mph – so well within our criteria – and there are plenty of models available for under £15,000 too.</p>
      <h3>Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2019/11/29110141/40553060-8396-477f-b804-4261a6639528.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Mercedes)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>&gt;<br/>On the other end of the scale to the Golf R is the CL55 AMG – a big, luxurious and powerful grand tourer from Mercedes-Benz. With a 5.4-litre V8 engine under the bonnet, it had more than enough performance to crack on to a top speed of 155mph.</p>
      <p>Despite being hugely expensive when it first arrived in the early 2000s, the second-generation CL is a luxury bargain at the moment – with loads of examples for well under £15,000. Just budget for premium bills, mind you.</p>
      <h3>BMW 330i (E46)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2019/11/29105934/9d9cd6dd-a14c-4a0f-83a6-bc70504bd706.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(BMW)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>&gt;<br/>The E46-era BMW 3 Series is an iconic generation, having been lapped up by thousands across the globe. The 330i, in particular, was a highlight thanks to its powerful straight-six engine. It meant that the 330i was a genuine 150mph car and one that could do it with little fuss, too.</p>
      <p>Plus, these cars aren’t at wallet-busting prices. In fact, they’re a bit of a bargain, and our £15,000 price limit should be able to net a particularly good example with change left over.</p>
      <h3>Mazda 6 MPS</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2019/11/29105936/cf6ddc70-a043-495e-bbae-6fdfe17c7b35.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Mazda)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>&gt;<br/>Who would’ve thought that the humble Mazda 6 would be appearing on this list? Okay, we’ll admit that it’s not any old 6, but the go-faster MPS version. Don’t let those understated looks fool you, as the MPS is packing a 2.3-litre turbocharged petrol engine with 256bhp.</p>
      <p>That means it’ll achieve 150mph, easily justifying its place on this list. Used examples are hard to find, but look closely and there’s likely to be one for under the £15,000 threshold.</p>
      <h3>Nissan 350Z</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2019/11/29105940/de3538c1-2c86-47b1-ab07-9f894ef0e8a1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Nissan)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>&gt;<br/>Nissan’s 350Z still looks good today, despite being launched back in 2002. That striking design is backed by genuine performance, too, thanks to a naturally-aspirated 3.5-litre V6 engine with 287bhp – though later versions got 306bhp.</p>
      <p>Limited to 155mph it’s a genuine contender on this list, plus used examples offer great value for money considering the grunt that the 350Z has on tap.</p>
      <h3>Vauxhall Monaro</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2019/11/29105939/95c6eac8-9d94-4254-a2dd-39fcb056764a.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Vauxhall)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>&gt;<br/>If you want all-out muscle car performance in the UK, you don’t have too many options. However, the Vauxhall Monaro is one of the few choices out there. Essentially a re-badged Australian-made Holden, this V8 powered bruiser is an excellent choice for those who want a boatload of character for not too much money.</p>
      <p>With a 5.7-litre V8 engine under the bonnet, the Monaro will easily crack 150mph. With a riotous soundtrack accompanying any touch of the throttle, this isn’t a car for shrinking violets.</p>
      <h3>BMW Z4 3.0i</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2019/11/29105844/3a699ca9-6d2c-43f9-9987-62bebca82953.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(BMW)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>&gt;<br/>BMW’s first-generation Z4 made waves when it arrived thanks to its ‘flame surfacing’ design and great handling. The 3.0i was a bit of a peach, too, thanks to the sprightly performance that it offered and the quality straight-six exhaust note it produced.</p>
      <p>Plus, it was limited to 155mph, so it’s more than worthy of a place in this list. A quality product, it’s a used purchase which makes sense and won’t break the bank, either.</p>
