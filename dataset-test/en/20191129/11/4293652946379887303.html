      <h1>Bill Peters out as Flames coach after allegations by Akim Aliu</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:14:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p>Bill Peters is out as head coach of the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/teams/calgary-flames/">Calgary Flames</a> in the wake of allegations made by former player Akim Aliu on social media, Sportsnet has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The Flames have called a press conference for 10:30 a.m. MT / 12:30 p.m. ET, where general manager Brad Treliving is expected to speak. <b><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/watch-live-flames-gm-treliving-addresses-media-bill-peters-firing/">Watch the press conference live on Sportsnet or Sportsnet.ca.</a></b></p>
      <p>On Monday night, Aliu alleged on Twitter that Peters had directed a racial slur toward him “several times” while the two were together in the AHL. Aliu played for Peters when he was head coach of the Rockford IceHogs, Chicago’s AHL affiliate, for five games in the 2008-09 season and 48 games in 2009-10. Aliu also appeared in 13 games for the ECHL’s Toledo Walleye in ’09-10.</p>
      <p>Since the allegation, Peters has not run a practice for the Flames and was not on the bench for their Wednesday night game in Buffalo. He also did not join the team on their charter flight back to Calgary.</p>
      <p>During Calgary’s game against Buffalo, Peters <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/flames-head-coach-bill-peters-apologizes-akim-aliu-incident/">released an apology to the Flames</a> in regards to the incident involving Aliu, though he did not mention him by name.</p>
      <p>On Thursday morning, <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/akim-aliu-releases-statement-response-bill-peters-apology/">Aliu issued a statement</a> responding to Peters’ letter.</p>
      <blockquote>I have read the statement of Bill Peters, which I found to be misleading, insincere and concerning. I have accepted an invitation from the NHL to meet and discuss this situation. Out of respect for that process, I will not respond publicly to the statement or discuss the racism and discrimination that I have endured until after my meeting.</blockquote>
