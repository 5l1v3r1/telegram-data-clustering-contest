      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 29 — An Indonesian female gymnast training for a major sport event has been sent home on grounds she was no longer a virgin, her family said today, a claim rejected by officials who insisted it was over disciplinary issues.</p>
      <p>Shalfa Avrila Sania, 17, had been due to leave for the biennial South-east Asian Games in the Philippines on November 26 until she was dismissed suddenly from the training in mid-November, her lawyer and family said.</p>
      <p>“The coach said my daughter always goes out late with her male friends and their interrogation showed she was no longer a virgin,” her mother Ayu Kurniawati told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Indonesia’s East Java province.</p>
      <p>“I was shocked. I want my daughter’s name cleared,” the mother-of-two added.</p>
      <p>Indonesia’s sports ministry denied the claim today, saying the dismissal was due to performance and disciplinary issues.</p>
      <p>“We will take firm action if the athlete was sent back due to questions over her virginity because this is a matter of privacy, dignity and has nothing to do with performance,” it said in a statement according to Indonesia’s <i>Detik</i> news website.</p>
      <p>Kurniawati said her daughter had won nearly 50 medals since she took up the sport when she was eight, and rejected doubts over her performance.</p>
      <p>The family has sent a letter to the ministry to protest her dismissal alongside a medical report that showed her hymen was intact, their lawyer Imam Muklas said by phone.</p>
      <p>Parts of Indonesia — the world’s most populous Muslim country — remain conservative and some still value female virginity highly, although pre-marital sex is not uncommon among the younger generation.</p>
      <p>Human rights groups have previously opposed “virginity tests” on Indonesian women seeking to join the police or military, saying the practice was unscientific and degrading.</p>
      <p>Other attempts to introduce virginity tests on students in some Indonesian schools faced opposition, including from among Islamic clerics. — Thomson Reuters Foundation</p>
