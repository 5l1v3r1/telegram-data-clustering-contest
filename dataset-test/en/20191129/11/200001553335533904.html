      <h1>From France: Arsenal have ‘already begun’ negotiations with ‘priority’ manager – Compensation payable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:14:41+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>There were countless claims about Unai Emery’s successor even before he left Arsenal, and that’s only going to increase now.</p>
      <p>One of the men thought to be in the picture is Nuno Espirito Santo, who has done such a good job with Wolves. Up until Wednesday evening there was nothing independent in the Portuguese media about a possible move to the Gunners, although that may change going forward.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mohamedbouhafsi/status/1200371017245503488?s=20">Mohamed Bouhafsi</a>, a well known journalist for France’s RMC, reports on Friday that Arsenal have ‘already begun’ talks with the Wolves manager’s entourage. That would presumably be Gestifute, Jorge Mendes’ agency.</p>
      <p>Nuno was Mendes’ first client back when the manager was a goalkeeper, and the pair maintain a close relationship.</p>
      <p>Should the information come from a Mendes source, and it’s not clear if it does, then it would be worrying news for Wolves fans.</p>
      <p>It’s stated, inevitably, that Arsenal would have to pay compensation to Wolves. Nuno is said to be ‘very interested’ and is described as the London club’s ‘priority’ target.</p>
