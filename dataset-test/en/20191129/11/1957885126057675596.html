      <h3>Dell Black Friday laptop deals</h3>
      <p>Let's start in the obvious place: laptops. Basically everything is on the table, from office-friendly models to Dell's assortment of own-brand and Alienware gaming machines. Even the latest models, with Intel 10th-generation processors, are included after being released just a few months earlier. Many laptops have only a nominal discount to get them onto the deal page, but you can get an additional 12 per cent or 15 per cent off with codes <b>BF12</b> and <b>BF15</b> so watch out for that!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-29-11-15/xps15.jpg/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There's an excellent <b>Dell XPS 15</b> mega deal on right now, <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3kau">discounting the highest-spec model by £520</a>, bringing the total to just under two thousand British pounds. That princely sum gets you a bleeding-edge specification: a 9th-gen Core i9 9980HK octa-core processor and GTX 1650 4GB discrete graphics card, backed with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB NVMe SSD.</p>
      <p>The screen is impressive too. It's a 15-inch 4K OLED model, a rarity on a laptop of any price and something of a wonder to behold. The resolution and colour reproduction of the screen make this XPS 15 laptop perfect for content creation tasks like image or video editing, helped by the powerful processor and heaps of RAM under the hood.</p>
      <p>If you're in the market for a premium laptop, the XPS 15 is one of the best available and this price represents a considerable savings. Most importantly, this laptop comes with the Rich Leadbetter seal of approval. You'll have to be fast though, with 62 per cent of stock claimed at the time of writing! <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3kau">Click here to see the deal</a> if you're interested.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-27-18-27/glaptopsusa.jpg/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If you're after a more gaming-focused laptop at a much lower price, a <b>gaming-spec G3 15</b> is also discounted in a Dell Mega Deal today. <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3kas">A £220 saving has been applied</a>, bringing the laptop to £700. The G3 15 has the same GTX 1650 graphics card as the XPS 15 above, paired with a ninth-gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of dual-channel RAM and a capacious 512GB NVMe SSD. Given the 1080p display, you should expect quite good gaming performance at a much lower price than the XPS. However, the 8GB of RAM is a bit limiting, and you may want to upgrade this to 16GB in the future for a nominal cost. Altogether though, it's a good deal that's worth considering.</p>

      <h3>Dell Black Friday monitor deals</h3>
      <p>Let's take a look at monitors now. Dell and its subsidiary, Alienware, make some of the best in the business, whether you're looking for a fast refresh gaming panel or a colour-accurate model ideal for content creation.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-25-14-30/AW2720hf.jpg/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The best deal we've found so far is on the <b>AW2720HF</b>, a 27-inch IPS monitor with a "blazing" 240Hz refresh rate. It's been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3jq2">discounted from £580 to a cool £450</a>, a reduction of about £130. That makes it an excellent choice for fast-paced games, while offering a larger picture and better colour reproduction than Dell's earlier 240Hz monitors, which used 24.5-inch TN panels. Despite being an IPS screen, pixel response times are excellent at 1ms and contrast ratio is decent too, at 1000:1. In terms of variable refresh rate (VRR) tech, the monitor is both FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible so it works great out of the box with Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-25-10-37/monitors.jpg/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Another good deal is on the <b>Dell S2716DG</b>, which has been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ic2">reduced by 51 per cent to £403</a>. This is a great price for a 27-inch monitor that includes all of the must-have gaming specs: a 2560x1440 resolution, a 155Hz refresh rate, 1ms GtG pixel response times and full-fat G-Sync. This is an awesome spec sheet that sits right in the current sweet spot for mid-range gaming, and it's backed up by universally positive user and critic reviews. If I had to go out and buy a monitor today for playing slow and fast-paced games, this is the best-of-both-worlds option I'd go for!</p>
      <p>Another obvious highlight from today's sale is the 240Hz <b>Alienware 25</b>, also known as the AW2518HF, which has been discounted from <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ibs">£430 to £299 - a 30 per cent reduction</a> - although it has occasionally sold for as little as £250 earlier this year. This FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible monitor works well on both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards and has that ridiculously high 240Hz refresh rate, making it easier to excel at fast-paced competitive games like Counter-Strike or Call of Duty. The display's image quality is surprisingly strong for a TN panel, so watching videos or image editing works well too.</p>
      <p>(The G-Sync version of this monitor, the AW2518<b>H</b>, has also been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ibu">reduced from £635 to £550</a>, but we recommend getting this model on Amazon (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alienware-AW2518H-Anti-Glare-LED-backlit-Response/dp/B073RLP9QC?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21">where it's cheaper at £459</a>) - or consider the cheaper FreeSync version as you can manually enable G-Sync in the Nvidia control panel.)</p>
      <p>Another interesting inclusion is the extremely extra <b>AW3418DW</b>, a 34-inch 3440x1440 monitor that overclocks to 120Hz. It's been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ibw">reduced from £1170 to £849</a>. (The same monitor is also <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alienware-AW3418DW-Curved-UltraWide-Monitor/dp/B076PTMVJ8?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21">available on Amazon at the same price if you prefer</a>.) That results in a crisp, fluid picture that completely fills your field of view - quite an experience. As it's an IPS panel, colours are accurate and viewing angles are strong too, so this is a great choice for colour-sensitive work like image or video editing. The monitor includes G-Sync, which removes tearing and judder without hampering input lag on PCs with Nvidia graphics cards. This monitor isn't cheap, but given that this ultra-wide could replace two smaller monitors it's actually quite reasonable! After all, once you try ultra-wide you won't want to go back...</p>

      <p>Here are our picks of the litter when it comes to office-friendly laptops. The New XPS 15 is the obvious star of the show, with its modern design and thin-bezel screen, but there are some great deals on cheaper Chrome OS and Windows laptops suitable for office or school work too.</p>
      <p>

      </figure>
      <p>When it comes to gaming laptops, there's only one obvious pick: the new Dell G3 15, which has a reasonably powerful GTX 1660 Ti backed with a large 512GB SSD, 8GB of RAM and a recent Core i5.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Gaming desktops now, and there are quite a few options on the table. The most interesting is the Dell G5 and monitor bundle, which includes a good 1080p gaming PC with a good entry-level 1080p gaming monitor for less than $900. The GTX 1660 Ti, 8GB of RAM and 9th-gen Core i5 are a potent combo, and should see you gaming without much - if any - need to reduce settings from the 'ultra' ideal. If you don't need a monitor, then you can get a similar system for only $800, while the Alienware Aurora desktop provides a higher spec with more SSD storage.</p>

      <p>Dell make some of the best gaming monitors in the business, and we've highlighted three here. The UltraSharp 27 is a good mid-size monitor for office or gaming use, with a crisp 2560x1440 resolution that gives you more screen real estate for work and a sharper image in games. The UltraSharp 34 is an ultra-wide variant, adding more horizontal resolution and a beautiful (and immersive) curve. Finally, the AW3420DW is the most expensive of the lot even after a $500 discount, but has double the refresh rate, making it ideal for fast-paced competitive games like shooters or battle royales.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/331q">Dell UltraSharp 27 U2717D for $270</a> (was $600)</b>
