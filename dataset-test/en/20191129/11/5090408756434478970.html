      <p>Buckingham Palace is hiring someone to ensure the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/royal-family">royal family</a> takes flights that are both “cost-effective” and environmentally friendly.</p>

      <p>“This role is critical to ensuring that the Royal Household operates and purchases safe, efficient, cost-effective, and appropriate travel services for the official duties of Members of the Royal Family and their Households,” the job advert reads.</p>
      <p>And it comes with a huge responsibility: The successful candidate will be in charge not only of organizing air travel but also “overseeing the operations of The Queen’s Helicopter Flight and usage of scheduled train services and the Royal Train.”</p>
      <p>Of course, traveling when you’re a royal isn’t as simple as it is for the average person, so the Director of Royal Travel will have to consult authorities to ensure all safety and security measure are in place.</p>
      <p>However, the job ad also stresses the importance of taking into account “environmental considerations.”</p>
      <p>“Leading a small team in the Royal Travel office, and The Queen’s Helicopter Flight, based at RAF Odiham, you will provide logistic support to the Royal Household including support of Court moves, State Visits and the provision of the staff travel service in support of all Households and of the Royal Collection,” the ad continues.</p>

      <p>“You will be required to ensure planning and procedures are highly effective, researching and negotiating value for money contracts and options for travel, while understanding and recommending best industry practice in risk and safety management.”</p>
      <p>The Royal Household says it’s looking for someone who’s skilled in planning, leading, managing, communicating, negotiation, conflict-solving, analysis and more.</p>
      <p>The closing date for applications is December 20, 2019, and you can <a href="https://theroyalhousehold.tal.net/vx/mobile-0/appcentre-1/brand-3/candidate/so/pm/1/pl/4/opp/2200-Director-of-Royal-Travel/en-GB">apply online here</a>.</p>
      <p>The job advert comes following the royal family facing repeated scrutiny for their travel choices in recent months.</p>
