      <p>Warren Gatland has revealed Wayne Pivac wasn't initially supposed to be in charge of Wales on Saturday when they face the Barbarians.</p>
      <p>Pivac makes his bow as Wales rugby coach at the Principality Stadium, going up against the man he replaced.</p>
      <p>And Gatland has now revealed the plan had first been for him to coach Wales for one final time.</p>
      <p>Asked about Pivac's new regime, he said: "He needs a little bit of time to put his own personality onto it and his own imprint on the game, working with the other coaches, gelling together, and that takes some time.</p>
      <p>"That was why I felt it was really important to have this game. Initially, when I was told about this game going ahead, the idea was that it was going to be my last game in charge of Wales.</p>
      <p>"I just felt that it was not right for that to happen. I was finished after the Rugby World Cup and it was a great chance for the new coaching team to come in and to get some time with the players.</p>
      <p>"This will give them a good chance to assess those players and help them build for the Six Nations, and I just felt that was really important.</p>
      <p>"Rather than the Barbarians asking me, I had to ask the Barbarians if I could coach them against Wales! It was important for Wales and for the new management team too."</p>
