      <h1>Save Over £170 on Netgear's Whole Home Orbi Mesh Wi-Fi System in Amazon's Black Friday Sale</h1>

      <p>Houses may not be getting bigger, especially if you live in the South East, but our dependence on Wi-Fi certainly is. Almost everything we buy now needs some sort of network connection, and with everything spread out across your place you need a solid Wi-Fi signal.</p>
      <p>Some places may be okay with a standard ISP-provided router, but others might not - and a Mesh network is the way to deal with the problem of signal blackspots. Fortunately Amazon has a big sale on Mesh networks for Black Friday - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B072MY95N7">including 37 per cent off Netgear's whole home Orbi mesh kit.</a></p>
      <p>Normally costing £472.79, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B072MY95N7">today it costs just £300</a> - and that gets you the Orbi router and two satellites to spread throughout your house. That way you can get consistent Wi-Fi on your toilet, in the bedroom, on the sofa, and all with a seamless connection that automatically switches you to the strongest signal.</p>
      <p>Of course if you don't need two satellites, you can get a two-device kit that comes with a router and a single satellite for £210 - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01KVRRSNI">which is £90 less than the £300 RRP.</a> You can also buy a single Orbi satellite to add to an existing mesh connection for £120, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01MZ6MRLD">which is £30 lower than normal.</a></p>
      <p>If Netgear isn't your thing then Amazon has discounts on all sorts of Mesh kits from different companies, including <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/91EF1603-3A97-4777-B514-D8CFE2D9F39C?ingress=2&amp;visitId=dff6bc94-bdcd-436c-a874-1b305977b29f&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_1647945031">TP-Link,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/62F7E544-46A8-4B80-98A6-1470E7AE686B?ingress=2&amp;visitId=c9a709f9-c0cf-487a-bf07-0ad8554f2f8d&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_1658765031">Linksys</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/54CB10BA-5CF9-4F85-B6A2-94372F189BED?ingress=2&amp;visitId=2d19803f-a31e-46e1-8d1a-981ee0fd15ff&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_1745556031">Tenda Nova</a>.</p>
