      <p>DBZ Kakarot will allow players to experience the whole Dragon Ball Z storyline. Additionally, it will be possible to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-new-screens-showcase-dragon-ball-collection-enemies/">collect the seven Dragon Balls</a> and use them to unlock battles that are not normally available.</p>
      <blockquote>In DBZ Kakarot, the seven Dragon Balls are scattered across different areas throughout the game.<br/>By locating and collecting them, players will be able to summon the mighty Shenron to revive previously defeated enemies!<br/>By meeting and fighting those former foes, players may unlock new dialogue options based on the situation.<br/>For example, if players revive Frieza once they have unlocked Goku’s Super Saiyan 3 transformation (a transformation Frieza did not witness in the original anime), the two characters will share a short never-before-seen conversation.<br/>Upon defeating these enemies, players will gain XP and unlock their Soul Emblems to use in the Community Boards to unlock new skills and abilities.</blockquote>
      <p>DBZ Kakarot is not going to reinvent role-playing games in any way, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-hands-on-preview/">it will still be an enjoyable game for all Dragon Ball Z fans.</a></p>
      <blockquote>I wasn't expecting much of Dragon Ball Z Kakarot, but the E3 2019 demo definitely left me impressed. It can get a big mashy in battle, and some exploration mechanics could use a little tweaking, but there's no denying that any Dragon Ball Z fan will enjoy the game, as the presentation is top-notch and the gameplay fun, albeit not particularly original.</blockquote>
      <p>Dragon Ball Z Kakarot releases on January 17th, 2020 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One worldwide.</p>
