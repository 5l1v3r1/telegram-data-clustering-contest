      <p>DC Comics pulled its ad campaign for an upcoming Batman comic book after Chinese fans claimed Batwoman looked like a Hong Kong protester and accused the company of supporting the city’s anti-China demonstrations.</p>
      <p>The deleted images showed Batwoman preparing to throw a Molotov cocktail imposed on a text background that read: “The future is young.”</p>
      <p>They were promotional materials for the upcoming comic book, “Dark Knight Returns: The Golden Child,” due to be released December 11.</p>
      <p>The book is about Carrie Kelley, aka Batwoman, teaming up with Lara Kent – the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman – to fight “a terrifying evil” in Gotham City, <a href="https://www.dccomics.com/comics/dark-knight-returns-the-golden-child-2019/dark-knight-returns-the-golden-child-1">according to DC Comics’ synopsis</a>. It makes no mention of Hong Kong or China.</p>
      <p>The company removed the poster from all its Twitter and Instagram channels on Thursday, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dc-comics-batman-poster-hong-kong-protests-china-1474586">Newsweek reported</a>.</p>

      <p>Hours after the ad campaign was released on Wednesday, Chinese fans claimed the book depicted ongoing anti-China protests in Hong Kong, representing veiled support for the demonstrators. Thousands of people have been protesting the Chinese government’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/hong-kong">increasing encroachment on the semi-autonomous city</a> since June.</p>
      <p>People on Weibo, the popular Chinese social media platform, said Batwoman’s throwing a Molotov cocktail symbolized Hong Kong protesters doing the same, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dc-comics-warner-brothers-batman-1203419190/">Variety reported</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-inside-hong-kong-protests-police-clash-tear-gas-2019-10">Demonstrations have become increasingly violent</a> in recent weeks, with police officers deploying tear gas and live rounds, and activists using Molotov cocktails and acid on numerous occasions.</p>

      <p>Chinese commentators also said Batwoman’s black clothing and masked face referenced the de facto uniform of the Hong Kong protests – a black t-shirt, black trousers, and a gas mask.</p>
      <p>Batman has virtually always dressed in black.</p>
      <p>Chinese fans also claimed that the “golden child” in the book’s title referred to the color yellow, the unofficial color of pro-democracy protests in 2014, Variety said.</p>
      <p>One person wrote on Weibo, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/meigi_elf/status/1199769442390949888">screenshot</a> posted on Twitter: “I don’t even know what the hell DC is trying to hint at. I’ve truly never seen Batman hold a Molotov cocktail before.”</p>
      <p>Another Weibo user wrote: “I don’t know what exactly [DC Comics] is trying to say, but it’s certainly a bit sensitive.”</p>
      <p>Another person wrote, according to Variety: “The black clothes represent Hong Kong, the mask represents Hong Kong, the Molotov cocktail represents Hong Kong, what else here doesn’t represent Hong Kong???”</p>

      <p>China’s state-run Global Times tabloid also joined in the fray, <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1171508.shtml">reporting</a> that the poster “implied its support of Hong Kong’s rioters.”</p>
      <p>Business Insider was unable to find any posts relating to “Dark Knight Returns: The Golden Child” on Weibo on Friday, suggesting that the platform’s censors had blocked all mention of the topic.</p>
      <p>Weibo often removes posts and censors key words to prevent discussion of politically sensitive topics.</p>

      <p>DC Comics has not yet responded to Business Insider’s request for comment.</p>
      <p>It is one of many Western companies to have bowed to pressure from Chinese consumers in recent years – <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-china-so-hard-western-companies-marketing-2019-10">a testament to the China market’s enormous clout</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/western-companies-apologize-china-communist-party-list-2019-10">Dozens of brands, from Dior to Versace to the Houston Rockets</a>, have groveled to Chinese customers after running ad campaigns or products that did not appear to respect China’s perceived borders and internal politics.</p>
      <p>China has proven itself to be an increasingly valuable market to Hollywood production studios, including DC Comics’ parent company Warner Bros.</p>
      <p>US and Canadian box offices earned a total of $11.9 billion on all films last year, while China alone earned $9 billion, according to the <a href="https://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MPAA-THEME-Report-2018.pdf">Motion Picture Association of America</a>.</p>
      <p>Warner Bros’ 2018 movie, “Aquaman,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-hollywood-movies-at-china-box-office-in-2018-venom-aquaman-2018-12">reaped more than $232 million</a> in Chinese box office sales last year, some $44 million more than what it gained in US box offices.</p>
