        <b>Thanksgiving hosts should designate a specific room for all potentially heated political discussions and establish a moderator, according to a Los Angeles-based etiquette coach who <a href="https://apnews.com/deb5250314a44feea5aaa36150b479fe?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=APEastRegion&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">spoke</a> to the Associated Press (AP).</b>

      <p>The AP spoke to etiquette coach Elaine Swann in an article titled “On the Thanksgiving menu: Turkey, with a side of impeachment.”</p>
      <p>Swann does not necessarily recommend quashing the conversation, calling for hosts to “take a route to allow some sort of platform, but with guidelines.”</p>
      <p>“I do think it’s healthy for people to express themselves and to have those conversations,” Swann said.</p>
      <p>The AP offered one “tactic”: Designating a room for impeachment talk and selecting “a calm family member as a combination moderator-peacekeeper.”</p>
      <blockquote>One tactic: sequester the debates. She’ll have a room away from the dining table stocked with snacks for people who want to talk politics. She also suggests designating a calm family member as a combination moderator-peacekeeper. [Alex] Triantafilou, a former judge, said that role often falls to him, although he wouldn’t mind taking a break from politics for the day. “My preference would be to not have the conversations at Thanksgiving,” he said. “I’d rather watch football and leave politics behind.”</blockquote>
