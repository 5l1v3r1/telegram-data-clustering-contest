      <p>Sonic redesign achieved with “no exploitation” or crunch, says animator</p>
      <p>Speaking to an <a href="https://sonicteamargentina.blogspot.com/2019/11/resideno-de-sonic-nota-especial.html">Argentinian Sonic fansite</a> (<a href="https://tailschannel.tumblr.com/post/189341529924/sonic-movie-redesign-interview">translated by Tails Channel</a>) via Nintendo Life, the significant redesign to one of gaming’s most legendary characters was done without crunch and did not come at significant cost to studio Paramount.</p>
      <p>“We were personally told that to change Sonic’s model, nearly 5 months of work were necessary &amp; they started working on the face,” says Max Schneider, animator on the movie.</p>
      <p>“To make the redesign, they had the model from the first trailer and a model of Modern Sonic. With this method, they compared &amp; checked what they could change to reach a balance between both models.”</p>
      <p>It has been reported that the Sonic redesign <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/sonic-redesign-cost-paramount-five-million-1202190493/">cost less than $5 million dollars</a> after an earlier claim speculated it was closer to $35 million. Either way, that’s a hell of a lot of cheddar to change the teeth on a hedgehog.</p>
      <p>The film was also delayed following the first trailer, due to much backlash and mockery online.</p>
      <p>The redesigned Sonic the Hedgehog <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/12/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer-new-design/">was revealed in a new trailer earlier this month</a>, revealing a new character design that’s much closer to the actual Sonic we know from the video games. i.e. he actually looks like a video game character, and not a weird sort of human being.</p>
