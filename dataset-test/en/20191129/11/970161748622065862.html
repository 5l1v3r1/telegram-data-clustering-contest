      <p>Rapper French Montana has confirmed he is ‘finally’ out of intensive care after being rushed to hospital last week.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old star revealed in a post on Instagram that he was out of the ICU, and was gradually recovering after suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, an irregular heart rate and severe stomach pain.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you everyone for all the prayers, love and support,’ French captioned an image of himself standing up in his hospital room. ‘I’m finally out of the ICU and am getting better one day at a time.’</p>

      <p>Fans immediately wished the rapper a speedy recovery and sent him love and support on social media.</p>
      <p>French had posted another brief update on Instagram earlier this week, revealing he was in the intensive care unit, with a board on the wall of his room revealed hospital staff were trying to “manage pain” for him.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/french-montana-911-call-intoxicated-hospital/">TMZ</a> had originally reported that French Montana – real name Karim Kharbouch – was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital after suffering from ‘scary cardiac issues and intense nausea’.</p>
      <p>Police were said to have attended French’s Calabasas home after a neighbour reportedly called 911, believing a robbery was taking place. Officers called him an ambulance after he collapsed following their arrival.</p>
      <p>The suspected cause of his issues is believed to be contaminated food, after sources claimed he was travelling around Europe and the Middle East over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>French, who previously dated Khloe Kardashian in 2013 and 2014, had returned to his native Morocco to visit family.</p>

      <p>A source informed <a href="https://www.eonline.com/uk/news/1096374/khloe-kardashian-is-worried-but-in-touch-with-ex-french-montana-amid-hospitalization">E! News</a> that Khloe immediately got in touch with French after his hospitalisation to express her concern for his well-being.</p>
      <p>‘Khloe has been in touch with French,’ a source told the outlet. ‘She heard the news and was concerned about him. ‘She is still worried about him and hoping he gets some good news and they figure out what’s going on.’</p>
      <p>French is due to release his third studio album Montana, this month, which will feature collaborations with Post Malone and Cardi B.</p>
