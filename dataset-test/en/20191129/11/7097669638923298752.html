      <p>Two K-pop stars have been sentenced to prison for gang raping a drunk, unconscious woman.</p>
      <p>Jung Joon-young, a singer-songwriter who was previously the lead singer of the group Drug Restaurant, was sentenced to six years in prison, while Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of the group FT Island, was sentenced to five years by a South Korean court.</p>
      <p>Jung, 30, was also charged with filming sex videos with women without their knowledge and sharing the footage, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-southkorea-kpop/k-pop-singer-sentenced-to-six-years-in-jail-for-rape-sharing-secret-sex-videos-idUKKBN1Y30ET">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Seoul Central District Court in South Korea said in a statement on Friday that the stars were convicted of committing "special quasi-raping," which occurs when multiple people collaborate to have illicit sexual intercourse with someone who is unconscious or unable to resist, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/k-pop-stars-jung-joon-young-choi-jong-hoon-convicted-rape-sentenced-prison-today-south-korea-2019-11-29/">according to CBS News</a>.</p>
      <p>Both men were also ordered to complete 80 hours of sexual-violence courses and are barred from working with children, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50596943">the BBC reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Judge Kang Seong-soo said Jung raped women who were "drunk and unable to resist, filmed them nude and having sex, then spread it on a group chat."</p>

      <p>"We can't imagine the pain the victims might have felt who found out later," he said, according to the BBC.</p>
      <p>The court also said Choi, 30, "did not feel remorse after mass-raping drunken victims," the BBC reported.</p>
      <p>It said both stars were in online chat groups that joked about drugging and raping women, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Jung <a href="https://www.insider.com/k-pop-star-yong-jun-hyung-quit-spy-cam-porn-scandal-2019-3?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">confessed in March</a> to filming himself having sex with 10 women without their consent, as part of a scandal that has rocked the K-pop world, which <a href="https://www.insider.com/kpop-dark-side-gym-diet-dating-great-guys-crayon-pop-2019-10?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">tries to project a clean image</a>.</p>
      <p>"I admit to all my crimes. I filmed women without their consent and shared it in a social-media chat room, and while I did so I didn't feel a great sense of guilt," <a href="https://www.insider.com/k-pop-superstar-jung-joon-young-admits-secret-sex-video-scandal-2019-3?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">the 30-year-old then said in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>He said then that the sex was consensual.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.insider.com/k-pop-superstar-jung-joon-young-admits-secret-sex-video-scandal-2019-3?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">posted the videos on a chat room on KakaoTalk,</a> an instant-messaging service.</p>

      <p>Yong Jun-hyung, another K-pop star, left his band in March and acknowledged watching the videos. He then said on Instagram: "I received a video from Jung and did have inappropriate conversations."</p>
      <p>Jung and Yong were caught only because the Korean police were already investigating another K-pop megastar over separate report of illegal activity.</p>
      <p>The police began investigating the Big Bang star "Seungri" — real name Lee Seung-hyun — in January, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/culture/music/article/2186260/nightclub-linked-k-pop-star-seungri-investigated-over-alleged-drugging">after a reported sexual assault at a nightclub called Burning Sun</a> in Seoul's Gangnam district. Seungri was the club's public-relations director.</p>
      <p>The police then discovered the sex videos as well as him talking online about securing prostitutes, leading him to be charged by the police.</p>
