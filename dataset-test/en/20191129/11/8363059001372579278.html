      <h1>Amazon's Black Friday Sale Cuts the Price of Beats Solo3 Headphones by Over £100</h1>

      <p>Yes, they launched in 2016, but they're still sporting a £250 price tag which has been almost cut in half for today only.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/11/beats-solo3-wireless-headphones-australian-review/">Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones</a> are currently £139 on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07H3XZMR3?th=1">Amazon</a> just for today, although the 44 per cent discount only applies to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07G2QFS3W?th=1">Indigo</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07GNJ4GJ2?th=1">Magenta</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07H3XZMR3?th=1">Violet</a> colourways which is fine because they're amongst the best colours on offer. I have spoken.</p>
      <p>If you disagree, then you'll have to pony up a bit more cash depending on which variant floats your boat. Satin Gold is 32 per cent off and will set you back £169, Red has been discounted by 36 per cent and is £159 until the sale wraps up at the end of the day, Matte Gold is 30 per cent off bringing the price down to £175, while Gloss White is £179.99 with 28 per cent off.</p>
      <p>Even thought they're three years old, the headphones are decent enough for the cheaper price, but let's be honest - you're mostly paying for the brand. If you're not fussed about noise cancelling, you can't go too wrong with these.</p>
