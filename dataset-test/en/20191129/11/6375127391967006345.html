      <h3>THE Philippine National Police leadership yesterday mourned the death of a brave policeman who was killed while trying to subdue a grenade-wielding man in Initao, Misamis Oriental and at the same time praised another who helped deliver a baby inside a tricycle in Sorsogon City. “The Philippine National Police mourns the death of another hero cop. We give our heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved family of Police Senior Master Sergeant Jason Magno of Initao Police Station in Misamis Oriental. PSMS Magno made a supreme sacrifice by covering the grenade with his own body to save innocent civilian lives. He truly lives up to his sworn duty, to serve and protect even if it costs his life,” said PNP spokesman Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac.</h3>
      <p>According to the official, the PNP headed by Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa has expressed its condolences to the family of Magno and assured them of full financial assistance.</p>
      <p>Banac said  similar financial assistance and other benefits will also be given to Magno’s colleague, Senior Master Sergeant Alice Balido who, though wounded, managed to shoot the suspect dead.</p>
      <p>He said  surviving kin of Magno will receive death benefits which include: P250,000 from the Presidents Social Fund;  P141,000 to P181,000 Special Financial Assistance (SFA) from the PNP; Burial benefits worth P50,000; and P200,000 gratuity from the National Police Commission.</p>
      <p>As a member of the Public Safety Mutual Benefit Fund, his family may also be entitled to death insurance.</p>
      <p>These death benefits are on top of the estimated P15,000  monthly lifetime pension from the PNP and roughly the same amount of pension for five years from the National Police Commission.</p>
      <p>“We urge to the public to include in their prayers the fast recovery of Sergeant Balido and the wounded students,” he added.</p>
      <p>Police Regional Office 10 director Brig. Gen. Rolando B. Anduyan said  Sgt. Magno saved others from instant death or serious injuries when he used his body to shield the others from the impact of the explosion 11:20 a.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Anduyan said  prior to the blast, local policemen rushed to the site to check a report of a man roaming the area while carrying a fragmentation grenade.</p>
      <p>The official said  Sgts. Magno and Balido were the first to confront the suspect who was identified as 65-year old Ibrahim Basher, a resident of Madamba, Lanao del Sur.</p>
      <p>Lt. Gen. Gamboa also commended the good deed of a cop who assisted in the delivery of a baby at Barangay Cabid-an, Sorsogon City.</p>
      <p>Having some knowledge and skills as former medical practitioner, Staff Sergeant Godwhin Lladones assisted  Jocelyn Bandala in giving birth to a baby girl beside the road. Baranda and her baby are now in good condition at the Fernando B. Duran Sr. Memorial Hospital where they were taken for proper medical attention.</p>
