      <h1>Vodacom dismisses CEO departure talk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:38:24+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#mannypham" target="_blank">Manny Pham</a></address>
      <p>Vodacom Group denied reports CEO Shameel Joosub (<i>pictured</i>) was heading for the door, but revealed its CFO Till Streichert had become the second C-level executive to resign from the company in as many days.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Vodacom labelled a report on CEO Joosub’s departure as “spurious, baseless and untrue”. The original report from <i>Tech Financials</i> stated the executive was to take up a newly created role from stakeholder Vodafone, citing an anonymous source.</p>

      <p>Vodacom separately said CFO Streichert (<i>pictured, left</i>) had tendered his resignation and would leave his role in June 2020 to “pursue an external opportunity”.</p>
      <p>Streichert joined Vodadom in early 2014, with the company stating it had already begun seeking a replacement.</p>
      <p>Joosub said Streichert’s departure would be a “significant loss” to the telecoms industry, citing “valuable contributions” made to Vodacom, including leading an IPO in Tanzania, “pivotal roles in the acquisition of a strategic stake in Safaricom and the completion of the largest-ever black economic empowerment transaction in the South African telco industry”.</p>
      <p>Streichert said he would work to ensure a “seamless transition to the next CFO” during his remaining months.</p>
      <p>News of Streichert’s departure came hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/vodacom-cto-quits-to-link-up-with-former-boss/">resignation of CTO Andries Delport</a> following 23 years with the company. Local reports tipped the executive to take up a role with infrastructure company CIVH, a move which would see him reconnect with former Vodacom CEO Pieter Uys.</p>
      <p>Delport will depart in May 2020, Vodacom said.</p>
