      <p>If you’re always forgetting your passwords, or losing the piece of paper you’ve written them on, it may be time to switch to a password manager. A password manager is a great way to keep your accounts secure. It can create strong passwords for you, store them securely, and automatically log you into sites and apps, so you don’t have to go searching for your passwords.</p>
