      <p>White House staffers sent generic Thanksgiving tweets from President Donald Trump’s Twitter account to avoid suspicion had his account been silent as he made <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trump-surprises-us-troops-afghanistan-thanksgiving-2019-11">a secret trip to visit US troops in Afghanistan</a>.</p>
      <p>There was no forward announcement of the trip, which Trump for security reasons made in a blacked-out plane on Thanksgiving eve, with White House staff members going to extraordinary lengths to shroud the trip in secrecy.</p>
      <p>When Trump visited troops in Iraq at Christmas last year, close watchers of the president became suspicious when the usually Twitter-obsessed president fell silent for several hours.</p>

      <p>So to avoid suspicion this time, staffers sent out generic Thanksgiving messages from the president’s account as he made the 13-hour journey to Kabul, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/politics/trump-afghanistan.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">confirmed to The New York Times</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump started Wednesday with a round of golf at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, with the White House announcing that he would be spending the evening there.</p>
      <p>But soon after Trump instead boarded Air Force One for the 7 p.m. flight to Afghanistan, where US troops have been stationed since 2002.</p>
      <p>Even reporters who travelled with the president on the journey were told the destination only two hours before their arrival,<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/28/trump-thanksgiving-visit-afghanistan-074391">Politico reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s a dangerous area and he wants to support the troops,” Grisham told Politico. “He and Mrs. Trump recognise that there’s a lot of people far away from their families during the holidays, and we thought it’d be a nice surprise.”</p>
      <p>During the trip to Bagram Airfield, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trump-surprises-us-troops-afghanistan-thanksgiving-2019-11">Trump served Turkey to US soldiers</a>, met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and posed for pictures with service members.</p>
