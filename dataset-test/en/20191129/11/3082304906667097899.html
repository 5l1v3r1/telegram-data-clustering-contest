        <b>Juventus have secured top spot in Champions League Group D and Leonardo Bonucci is hopeful his side will not draw Tottenham in the last 16.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tottenham are the team to avoid in the knockout stages of the Champions League because of the Jose Mourinho factor, according to Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has won both matches since replacing Mauricio Pochettino as head coach, including a 4-2 victory over Olympiacos on Tuesday that secured a place in the last 16 of UEFA’s flagship club competition.</p>
      <p>Tottenham cannot finish above Bayern Munich in Group B, while Juventus are assured of top spot in Group D with one round of fixtures still to play.</p>
      <p>The two teams could therefore meet in the next round, but Bonucci would prefer not to play the London club.</p>

      <p>“But many things can change between now and February.”</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was back in Juve’s starting line-up for Tuesday’s 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid after missing last weekend’s league victory at Atalanta due to a knee complaint.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international reacted angrily to being substituted two games in a row earlier this month, but Bonucci insisted there are no issues behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>“We talked about it,” Bonucci said. “The important thing is that when somebody isn’t playing at their best, someone else steps up.</p>
      <p>“We have more than one player that is ready to do that.</p>
      <p>“Ronaldo is part of a group that will be competitive until the end. The goal is to remain competitive until March and beyond.”</p>
