        <b>France are in Pot 2 for Saturday’s Euro 2020 draw and Robert Pires would welcome the chance for the world champions to face England.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Pires hopes France are paired with a reinvigorated and “motivated” England in the Euro 2020 group stage.</p>
      <p>Both sides finished top of their qualifying groups to get their name in the hat for Saturday’s draw in Bucharest.</p>
      <p>England will host a total of seven matches in next year’s finals and are in Pot 1, while France – despite being world champions – are in Pot 2.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal winger Pires would like to see his native France face off against Gareth Southgate’s side, who he believes will be a big threat in the tournament.</p>
      <p>“What’s for sure is that we’re going to draw a big team because unfortunately we’re in Pot 2,” he told Omnisport, speaking as part of the UEFA Champions League Trophy Tour driven by Nissan.</p>

      <p>“Which one I would like to play against? France-England would be nice.</p>
      <p>“I think that we’re strong but the English are having a renaissance and Southgate has built a good team, quite young, with a bit of experience and they can be a good surprise during the next Euros.</p>
      <p>“And as you know the final is in London so they will be motivated.”</p>
      <p>One team Pires is eager for France to avoid is Spain, who qualified for the competition with an unbeaten record that sets them out among the favourites.</p>
      <p>“The team to avoid is always Spain,” added Pires, who won the World Cup and European Championship during his playing days.</p>
      <p>“They remain very strong, they’re very skilled and they cause problems to us every time.”</p>
