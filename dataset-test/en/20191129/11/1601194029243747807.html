      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/karnataka">Karnataka</a> player <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/a-mithun">Abhimanyu Mithun</a> created history when he took five wickets in seven balls, including a hat-trick in the last over of the first semi-final of the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/syed-mushtaq-ali-trophy">Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019</a> against Haryana in Surat today.</p>
      <p>W, W, W, W, wd, 1, W were Mithunâ€™s figures to complete a five-for in one over which included a hat-trick. Before this, the former India pacer registered dismal figures of 0 for 37 in his three overs. In an attempt to go past the 200-run mark, Haryana batsmen Himanshu Rana, Rahul Tewatia, Sumit Kumar, Amit Mishra, and Jayant Yadav all fell to Mithun.</p>

      <p>Mithun is enjoying a fantastic end to 2019, having recently become the first-ever Karnataka bowler to take a hat-trick in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, claiming five for 34 in the final against Tamil Nadu. He also has a Ranji Trophy hat-trick to his name, taking the wickets of Piyush Chawla, Amir Khan, and RP Singh in the 2009/10 season for Karnataka. After today's heroics, Abhimanyu Mithun became the first player to bag a hattrick in all the formats in Indian domestic cricket.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Mithun's great efforts, Karnataka were able to restrict a dangerous-looking Haryana side to only 194 for eight in their 20 overs. At the time of writing, Karnataka are cruising along at 144/1 in 11 overs. KL Rahul raced to 66 of just 31 balls. Devdutt Padikkal (59* of 30 balls) and Mayank Agarwal (16* off 5 balls) have brought the run-rate down to less than run-a-ball as Karnataka are on course of sealing a berth in the finals.</p>
