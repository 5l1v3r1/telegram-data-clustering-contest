      <p>EDMONTON -- A woman accused in the death of a toddler found outside an Edmonton church has been found guilty of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Tasha-Lee Doreen Mack and the child's father, Joey Crier, were each charged with second-degree murder in the death of 19-month-old Anthony Joseph Raine.</p>
      <p>The boy's lifeless body was found outside the Good Shepherd Anglican Church in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mack, who had pleaded not guilty, was convicted of the lesser charge.</p>
      <p>She stared straight ahead as she listened to the decision and looked down, wiping away tears as she was told the verdict.</p>
      <p>Queen's Bench Justice Rob Graesser presided over the trial, which started in June and heard that Anthony suffered abuse before the fatal blow to his head.</p>
      <p><a href="https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/trial-begins-for-father-accused-of-murdering-19-month-old-son-1.4627837">Crier's trial</a>, which was held separately, is to hear final arguments next week.</p>
