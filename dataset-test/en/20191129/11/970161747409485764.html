      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aldi/">Aldi</a> was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/aldis-peaky-blinders-inspired-commercial-mariah-carey-walkers-christmas-adverts-2019-ranked-11066975/">one of the first supermarkets</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/time-aldi-christmas-2019-released-tv-kevin-carrot-returns-11050205/"> to release their much-anticipated</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christmas-tv-adverts/">Christmas TV advert</a> for 2019 and the store did not disappoint, with another adventure for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/kevin-the-carrot-aldi-christmas-advert-2019-11046782/">Kevin the Carrot</a> bought to life on our screens.</p>
      <p>The supermarket chain took inspiration from show <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/peaky-blinders/">Peaky Blinders</a> for the ad, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/aldi-channels-peaky-blinders-incredible-2019-christmas-11029034/">Russell Sprout and the Leafy Blinders</a> threatening to take back Christmas.</p>
      <p>Despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/aldis-peaky-blinders-themed-christmas-sees-kevin-carrot-hot-water-11048678/">starting the advert in hot water, Kevin prevailed</a> and closed out the 70 second segment with a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-greatest-showman/">The Greatest Showman</a> inspired, veg-filled routine to the tune of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/aldi-christmas-advert-2019-who-sings-let-me-entertain-you-and-when-was-robbie-williams-original-released-11057586/">Let Me Entertain You by Robbie Williams</a>.</p>
      <h3>What is Aldi’s Kevin the Carrot?</h3>
      <p>Aldi’s Kevin the Carrot is not only the star of their Christmas TV advert this year, but he has been a staple in their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/11/07/aldis-christmas-ad-about-kevin-the-carrot-has-a-distinctly-sausage-party-esque-theme-6240904/">festive ads since 2016</a>.</p>
      <p>In the past he’s featured in an Orient Express themed advert, as well as the supermarket’s fairy-tale inspired offering from last year.</p>

      <p>As they have done in previous years, Aldi released a range of Kevin the Carrot toys this year to celebrate their Christmas ad and celebrate their customers’ love of the cartoon carrot with his very own merchandise.</p>
      <h3>How much is Kevin the Carrott now selling for?</h3>
      <p>Kevin toys were available in Aldi stores, along with his female counterpart (and carrot wife) Katie and their three veg children.</p>
      <p>In honour of the advert this year, there were also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/aldis-limited-edition-kevin-the-carrot-toys-are-now-on-sale-11208769/">limited edition toy versions</a> of other cartoon carrot characters from the story including the sprouts and ‘Tiny Tom’.</p>

      <p>The toys went on sale in Aldi stores from Thursday 28 November at 8am and retailed from just £3.99 for a regular sized toy, with giant, 1 meter tall Kevin the Carrot toys on sale for £19.99.</p>
      <p>As has been the case for the last three years, the Kevin toys sold out almost instantly, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/thousands-adults-shove-aldi-get-kevin-carrot-11234377/">thousands of shoppers queued outside the stores</a> to try and get their hands on the toys before they were gone.</p>
