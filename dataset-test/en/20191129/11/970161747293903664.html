      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has issued an apology to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> after the Spaniard was sacked on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have ended Emery’s reign as manager after the 2-1 defeat at home to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eintracht-frankfurt/">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a> on Thursday evening extended the team’s run to seven matches without a victory.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg, who was already part of Emery’s first-team coaching staff, will manage Arsenal on an interim basis while the club look for a permanent replacement.</p>
      <p>In a statement released by Arsenal on Friday the club said: ‘The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.’</p>
      <p>Arsenal are currently on their worse run of form since February 1992.</p>

      <p>‘Thank you Unai and Javi I’m sorry we let you down,’ Martinez posted on Instagram.</p>
      <p>‘Its our fault for not performing the right way, I’m sure we will meet again.’</p>
      <p>Ljungberg’s first game in charge will be for Arsenal’s trip to Norwich City in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
