      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128027">49ers (10-1) at Ravens (9-2)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</b> | <b>Fox</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 91.2 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128027">Spread</a>:</b> BAL -6 (47)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Two of the NFL's best teams rely on different strengths. The Ravens are the NFL's highest-scoring team at 35.1 points per game, and quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> has led Baltimore to scores on his past 12 drives. The 49ers, meanwhile, are the league's second-stingiest defense at 14.8 points allowed per game, and San Francisco has allowed just one touchdown in its opponents' past 14 drives. Also worth watching: The Niners can clinch a playoff berth with a win and a Rams loss or tie, or a tie and a Rams loss. <i>-- Jamison Hensley</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Jackson will rush for 100-plus yards. He has done it three times this season and now faces a 49ers defense that has few weaknesses -- but one of them is its struggles against mobile quarterbacks. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray">Kyler Murray</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a> averaged 8.1 yards on 19 rushes against the Niners in three games earlier this season. <i>-- Nick Wagoner</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The 49ers' defense is allowing just 136.9 opponent passing yards per game this season, which is 21 yards per game fewer than the next-closest team (Patriots). If the season ended today, that mark would rank as the 16th-lowest since the 1970 merger. And every single one of those 15 teams with a better mark played in the 1970s, when teams were rushing nearly 35 times a game.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> It's been the Lamar Jackson show at home this season, and while that is fun to watch, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13981/mark-ingram-ii">Mark Ingram II</a>'s one touchdown run on 66 home carries has been underwhelming. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 13 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> San Francisco is the first team to enter a game as the underdog despite holding a 10-1 record or better since Seattle (11-1) was a 2.5-point underdog at San Francisco (8-4) in 2013. In the past 30 seasons, underdogs with records of 10-1 or better are 2-11 straight up and 3-10 against the spread (ATS), including 0-9 straight up and 1-8 ATS in non-Week 17 games. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28176142/week-13-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Titans have allowed only one player -- Carolina's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey">Christian McCaffrey</a> -- to rush for 100 yards in a game this season. But the Colts have had a player rush for at least 100 yards in a game five times this season, including back-to-back 100-yard rushing games from <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980077/jonathan-williams">Jonathan Williams</a>, who is starting in place of the injured <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139605/marlon-mack">Marlon Mack</a> (hand). <i>-- Mike Wells</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Tennessee's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043078/derrick-henry">Derrick Henry</a> will gain 100-plus rushing yards against the Colts' ninth-ranked run defense. Henry has 347 yards and four touchdowns in his past two games, but those came against poor run defenses. The last time Henry gained 100-plus yards against Indianapolis was in Week 6 of 2017. <i>-- Turron Davenport</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Titans are first in red-zone touchdown percentage (13-for-14, 92.9%) since Week 7. They were ranked 18th (53.3%) in Weeks 1-6.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Indy's Williams got 29 touches last week (26 carries and three catches), a total Mack has recorded just once in his career. Williams has assumed the Mack role, and he will once again assume starter duties this weekend. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 13 rankings</a>.</i></p>

When <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576980/marcus-mariota">Marcus Mariota</a> started, Tennessee was 2-4 ATS, with five of the six games going under the total. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28176142/week-13-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Jaguars have given up 200-plus yards rushing in three consecutive games, which makes them just the fourth team in the past decade to do so (2010 Bills, 2016 49ers, 2019 Bengals). No team has given up 200-plus yards rushing in four consecutive games since the 1986 Bucs (per ESPN Stats &amp; Information). Tampa Bay's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912550/ronald-jones-ii">Ronald Jones II</a> has never rushed for more than 80 yards in a game in his career, so this could be a big day for him, especially with linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3047566/myles-jack">Myles Jack</a> (knee) missing practice earlier this week. <i>-- Mike DiRocco</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> To that end, Tampa's running backs will top 150 rushing yards for the first time this season. The Jaguars have given up 35 rushing plays of 12 or more yards and 15 rushing touchdowns this year, both the second most in the league. They're also giving up 142.3 rushing yards per game (fourth most in the league.) <i>-- Jenna Laine</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Tampa Bay quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston">Jameis Winston</a> can become the sixth player (seventh instance) in NFL history with seven consecutive games of at least 300 passing yards. And per the Elias Sports Bureau, one more touchdown will tie Winston with Peyton Manning for the second-most passing touchdowns before turning 26 years old (Manning has 111, while Dan Marino leads with 145).</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Jags receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115394/dj-chark-jr">DJ Chark Jr</a>. has as many top-15 PPR finishes at the position as the Bucs' <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116165/chris-godwin">Chris Godwin</a> this season (five). <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 13 rankings</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Everyone will be on high alert for tensions to flare in this rematch, but with all major actors in the infamous fight sidelined, look for a low-drama game -- at least as it relates to extracurriculars. The Steelers' defense was unremarkable in the first matchup with the Browns. Safety <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925345/minkah-fitzpatrick">Minkah Fitzpatrick</a>, though, wants to rectify that this time around. <i>-- Brooke Pryor</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Cleveland's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr">Odell Beckham Jr</a>. catches two touchdowns for the first time all season, in a game otherwise defined by a series of unsportsmanlike conduct and unnecessary roughness penalties between two teams with plenty of bad blood. <i>-- Jake Trotter</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> With <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> under center, the Pittsburgh offense averaged 4.8 yards per play and 6.2 yards per pass attempt, and was 34% on third-down conversions. But with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3127051/devlin-hodges">Devlin Hodges</a>, those numbers jump to 5.3, 7.9 and 46%, respectively.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Browns running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb">Nick Chubb</a> has been among the most efficient runners in the league over his career, but in his past two meetings with the Steelers, he managed just 3.5 yards per carry. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 13 rankings</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Green Bay quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a> is coming off a season-worst 104 yards passing in a loss to the 49ers. But he's not facing the San Francisco defense on Sunday. Rodgers, who is fourth in the league with 10 40-plus-yard passes, gets to face a defense this week that has allowed the most such passes this season. The Giants (and Packers, whom they are tied with in the category) have both allowed 13. That sets the stage for some big plays Sunday. <i>-- Jordan Raanan</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> The Packers' defense -- 29th in yards allowed per game (400.1) since Week 4 and tied for last in yards allowed per play (6.5) -- will hold the Giants' 30th-ranked offense without a touchdown. <i>-- Rob Demovsky</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> How will the Panthers adjust defensively to the loss of nose tackle Dontari Poe, whose inside push has been big for a team that ranks second in the NFL in sacks? <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13608/kyle-love">Kyle Love</a> likely will be first up, but don't be surprised to see <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13240/gerald-mccoy">Gerald McCoy</a> and others rotate into Poe's spot.

      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Panthers running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey">Christian McCaffrey</a> will top 175 total yards and score once vs. the Redskins, who rank 23rd this season with 507 yards receiving allowed to opposing running backs.

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Dolphins (minus-14, ranked 32nd) and Eagles (minus-5, ranked 26th) are among the bottom seven NFL teams in turnover differential. Each team is also in the bottom seven in giveaways. The Eagles have a significant talent edge, but playing sloppy football and losing the turnover battle is the main way they can keep the Dolphins in this game. <i>-- Cameron Wolfe</i></p>

He will be matched against a Bengals secondary that allows the fourth-highest QBR to opposing quarterbacks, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information. <i>-- Ben Baby</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Jets running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15825/le'veon-bell">Le'Veon Bell</a> will crack the 100-yard rushing mark for the first time since Dec. 17, 2017, ending a streak of 12 consecutive games under the century mark. Bell showed signs of his old form last week, and he will be facing the worst run defense in the league. The Bengals are yielding 166 rushing yards per game. <i>-- Rich Cimini</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Cincinnati's Zac Taylor would become just the fifth coach in the Super Bowl era to lose his first 12 games as a head coach, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, should the Bengals drop this one on Sunday.

      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Denver quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574511/brandon-allen">Brandon Allen</a> is completing 42% of his passes over the past two weeks (worst in NFL), and he could join <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen">Josh Rosen</a> as the only quarterbacks this season to complete fewer than 50% of their passes in three straight weeks.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> For his career, Los Angeles receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15818/keenan-allen">Keenan Allen</a> is averaging just 45.3 receiving yards per game against the Broncos, but he has scored four times in four trips to Denver. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 13 rankings</a>.</i></p>

        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401127967">Patriots (10-1) at Texans (7-4)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>8:20 p.m. ET</b> | <b>NBC</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 94.2 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401127967">Spread</a>:</b> NE -3.5 (45)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Can the Texans' run defense get back on track against the Patriots? New England is averaging 3.4 yards per rush, third lowest in the NFL and on pace to be the lowest in the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a>/Bill Belichick era, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information. But the Texans have allowed 505 rushing yards in three games without J.J. Watt. <i>-- Sarah Barshop</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Brady tops his season-high total of 348 yards passing against Washington. This is a result of going against a defensive scheme he is familiar with, an increased comfort level with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128713/isaiah-wynn">Isaiah Wynn</a> back at left tackle for a second consecutive week, the projected return of receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2579604/phillip-dorsett-ii">Phillip Dorsett II</a> and possibly receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14922/mohamed-sanu-sr">Mohamed Sanu Sr</a>., and the Texans struggling to generate consistent pressure. <i>-- Mike Reiss</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Including the playoffs, New England is 10-1 all time against the Texans, the best record by one team against a single opponent from the same conference since the 1970 merger. That includes wins in all five matchups against Houston since Bill O'Brien became the head coach in 2014 after he had previously been a Pats assistant. The Patriots have a chance to clinch a playoff berth this weekend too, through <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL345/status/1199395812545052672?s=20">five different scenarios</a>.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Houston's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16777/carlos-hyde">Carlos Hyde</a> has a run gaining more than 30 yards in three straight games. On his other 41 carries over that stretch, he is averaging just 3.9 yards per carry. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 13 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Texans quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a> is 11-4 ATS in his career as an underdog. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28176142/week-13-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      </h3>
      <p><b>Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET</b> | <b>ESPN/<a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/">ESPN App</a></b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 87.2 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128112">Spread</a>:</b> SEA -3 (49.5)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Seahawks' defensive resurgence over the past two games has come against offenses that were missing some key pieces -- <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3040151/george-kittle">George Kittle</a> for the 49ers, and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14912/alshon-jeffery">Alshon Jeffery</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3060022/jordan-howard">Jordan Howard</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15797/lane-johnson">Lane Johnson</a> for the Eagles. Minnesota's offense is fifth in Football Outsiders' <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/dvoa-ratings">DVOA</a> rankings, and it has a chance to be at full strength with receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16460/adam-thielen">Adam Thielen</a> expected to return off the bye. <i>-- Brady Henderson</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Both <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577327/tyler-lockett">Tyler Lockett</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047650/dk-metcalf">DK Metcalf</a> will each haul in two receiving touchdowns. Quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a> should have his way with the Vikings' pass defense, which will have had 15 days to fix some of the issues that showed up routinely in Minnesota's first 11 games. <i>-- Courtney Cronin</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Vikings have used play-action on an NFL-high 34% of their offensive plays since Week 5, and Minnesota quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins">Kirk Cousins</a> has thrown a league-high 10 touchdowns without an interception on play-action passes over that span.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Wilson has scored more than 24 fantasy points in consecutive Week 13s, and the Vikings are allowing 26% more quarterback fantasy points per game on the road than at home this season. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 13 rankings</a>.</i></p>
