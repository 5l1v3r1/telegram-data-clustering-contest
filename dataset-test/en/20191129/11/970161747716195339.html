      <p>Jenna Dewan spent her Thanksgiving with her daughter Everly, amid claims her custody battle with ex-husband Channing Tatum has turned nasty.</p>
      <p>The exes, who are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/channing-tatum-jenna-dewans-divorce-finalised-almost-two-years-split-11192741/">officially single after filing for divorce in April 2018</a>, share six-year-old daughter Everly, and it has been reported that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/27/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-divorce-turns-nasty-child-support-claims-11227631/">the stars are struggling to come up with a custody agreement.</a></p>
      <p>But Jenna, 38, got custody for Thanksgiving, as the little one celebrated the holiday with the dancer, her family and partner Steve Kazee.</p>
      <p>The Step Up actress shared a number of attempts at group pictures with her father, her brothers and her boyfriend Steve, joking on Instagram: ‘The journey to get a good group picture though 😂 Grateful for so much today❤️ Happy thanksgiving everyone!!!’</p>

      <p>In the snaps, Jenna – who is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/24/jenna-dewan-expecting-first-child-boyfriend-steve-kazee-10800027/">pregnant with her first baby with Steve</a> – wore a paisley dress as she held Everly – wearing a blue dress – on her hip.</p>

      <p>Jenna placed a heart emoji over her daughter’s face in the images, including one where Steve held her up for a group picture.</p>
      <p>Another photo saw Once actor Steve, 44, cradling his girlfriend’s growing baby bump.</p>
      <p>It is unclear where Channing, 39, spent Thanksgiving, although his girlfriend Jessie J, 31, was filmed cooking up a storm on her own Instagram story – so perhaps the couple, who have been dating for a year, enjoyed a turkey together.</p>

      <p>Back in April 2018, Channing and Jenna, who married in 2009, confirmed their split with a statement reading: ‘We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together.</p>
      <p>‘Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now.</p>

      <p>‘There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best friends realising it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly.’</p>
      <p>However, it has been claimed that rows over custody of their daughter has made things frosty between the pair.</p>

      <p>Jenna was reportedly ‘super upset’ after her ex filed legal documents with a judge, asking for help with a holiday custody schedule.</p>
      <p>Insiders close to the pregnant star told TMZ she had already signed off on the entire schedule, something his sources have denied.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed Magic Mike star Channing has refused to let his ex change their schedule over work commitments, and would not let her FaceTime Everly when he was taking care of her.</p>
