      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">…Get Me Out Of Here!</a> contestants <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> have most certainly clashed over the past few days – but the former footballer has actually been defended by Andrew’s own wife.</p>
      <p>Bot Ian and Andrew have continued to lock horns during their stint in the jungle – arguing over both napping and food.</p>
      <p>Fans have even accused the Arsenal and England football star of ‘bullying’ the 44-year-old.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But now Wright has been defended from the most unlikely of quarters, Andrew’s wife Suraya El-Wakil.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/im-celeb-andrew-maxwells-wife-20983064">The Mirror</a>, she said that the Irish funnyman wasn’t ‘the easiest to live with.’</p>
      <p>‘Is it bullying? No, not at all,’ she answered. ‘I will be the first to tell you he is not the easiest to live with.’</p>
      <p>She added that she’s not particularly worried about her husband’s clashes with Ian, adding: ‘He’s a grown-up man. They’re all fine.’</p>

      <p>Suraya also said that she did side with Ian in terms of realising of how some of arguments had occurred with Andrew.</p>
      <p>‘Not doing the dishes after dinner is a daily struggle, so I feel for you, Caitlyn,’ she added.</p>
      <p>Ian has also been defended by his own wife, Nancy, over his actions on the reality programme.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10438074/im-a-celebrity-ian-wright-wife-bully/">She told The Sun</a>: ‘I don’t think it’s anything particular between them. They’re both quite strong characters. He has his moments but he’s doing well.’</p>
      <p>The BBC presenter is not the only one to have gotten hit with complaints from viewers, however. Ex-England rugby player James Haskell <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/29/im-celebritys-james-haskell-accused-legitimising-discrimination-disgusting-disability-comment-11237673/">has received a massive backlash</a> after his ‘disgusting’ disability comments.</p>
