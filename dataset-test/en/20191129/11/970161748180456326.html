      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> has hit back at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s ‘close friend’ Sophia Hutchins, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/sophia-hutchins-slams-piers-morgans-pathetic-probing-sex-life-caitlyn-jenner-sweary-rant-11233893/">after she branded him ‘pathetic’</a>.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was left furious after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/27/im-celebrity-sophia-hutchins-laughs-off-caitlyn-jenner-hanky-panky-rumours-addresses-relationship-claims-11224656/">she was quizzed on her sex life with the Olympian</a> – despite maintaining they are just pals, and ranted about him on her Instagram page.</p>
      <p>But the presenter, 54, wasn’t that fussed about the video, quote-tweeting a story on her comments with ‘Oh get over yourself..’</p>
      <p>It all kicked off between the pair after Sophia appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss her relationship with Kris Jenner’s ex.</p>
      <p>Piers started off their chat by getting right to the point, asking the businesswoman to lift the lid on her bond with the 70-year-old – following romance speculation.</p>
      <p>‘At the end of the day, Caitlyn and I are family,’ she replied, explaining that they have a great ‘partnership’.</p>

      <p>‘I think I’ve described it pretty well. At the end of the day, Caitlyn and I are family,’ she insisted.</p>

      <p>‘We’re great together in business and we have a great partnership, on the personal side as family, and on the business side, me managing her career and us supporting each other in whatever business ventures we’re involved in together.’</p>
      <p>Sliding straight in there, the host queried if they had had sex, asking: ‘No hanky panky then?’</p>
      <p>Unimpressed, she simply replied: ‘Oh, my God,’ before reiterating that they were ‘family’.</p>

      <p>While Sophia kept her cool live on air, she was left livid by the encounter, ranting about Piers on her Instagram page.</p>
      <p>In a clip shared on her Instagram story, she fumed: ‘Good Morning Britain, having Piers Morgan is your biggest mistake.</p>
      <p>‘What a joke of a journalist he is. ‘What a pathetic line of questioning he had for me this morning. Totally not cool.</p>
      <p>‘I went on to support Caitlyn on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!. Not deal with stupid b******t questions from some jack*** Piers Morgan.</p>
      <p>‘Piers, neither of us will ever do your show again.</p>
      <p>‘You have shown your true colours yet again. How disappointing.’</p>
      <p>Over to you, Sophia…</p>
