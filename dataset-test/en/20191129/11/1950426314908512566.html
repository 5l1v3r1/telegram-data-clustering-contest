      <h1>HuffPost: Thanksgiving ‘National Day of Mourning’ for Native Americans</h1>
      <h2>One of the lessons non-Natives need to understand, HuffPost explains, is that Thanksgiving is a “National Day of Mourning” for Native Americans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:38:48+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/28/huffpost-thanksgiving-national-day-of-mourning-for-native-americans/" target="_blank">Breitbart</a></address>

        <b>HuffPost has published a helpful Thanksgiving guide, “6 Things Every Non-Native Should Do On Thanksgiving,” after asking “Indigenous educators and activists to share what non-Natives need to know to be a good ally.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the lessons non-Natives need to understand, HuffPost <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ally-to-native-americans-on-thanksgiving_l_5ddc4237e4b00149f7223b30?ncid=APPLENEWS00001">explains</a>, is that Thanksgiving is a “National Day of Mourning” for Native Americans because of “the subsequent, nation-wide racial genocide that occurred between the settlers and the tribes whose territories they encroached on, and ongoing assaults on Native culture and religion.”</p>
      <p>Other things to know, or do, include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“The pilgrims could only settle at Plymouth because thousands of Native Americans, including Wampanoags, had been killed by disease brought by earlier European ships settlers.” (The Boston metropolitan area is <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US14460-boston-cambridge-newton-ma-nh-metro-area/">home</a> to nearly 5 million people today.)</li>
        <li>HuffPost advises parents to challenge the “Eurocentric” curriculum at their children’s schools, in favor of a “more inclusive, truthful curriculum.” One could, for example, object to “stereotypical costume activities in the classroom” such as children playing the roles of Pilgrims and Indians in Thanksgiving plays.</li>
        <li>HuffPost suggests donating to a Native American charity, because it’s “not entirely true” that federal funding and successful casino enterprises provide enough resources for Native communities’ basic needs.</li>
        <li>HuffPost urges readers to take action on climate change and environmental protection, because “when the environment is encroached on, it hurts them [Native Americans] the most.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>HuffPost cautions, however, that non-Natives should not abuse their new knowledge or involvement to speak or act on behalf Native communities: “[T]he goal is to amplify the voices of the community you support, not shout over them and drown them out.”</p>
