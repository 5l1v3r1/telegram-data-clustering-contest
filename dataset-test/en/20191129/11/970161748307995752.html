      <p>Lord Varys had a relative easy ride in Game of Thrones until he was confronted with one of Daenerys Targaryen’s dragons and incinerated in front her small council. As one of the master manipulator’s of the series, his moral compass was a blurry one for fans.</p>
      <p>Bursting with a wealth of secrets, the right hand man to King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) later pledged his allegiance to the Mother of Dragons (Emilia Clarke), despite initially throwing all his support behind her assassination.</p>
      <p>But George RR Martin had Varys’ path laid out from the beginning and knew exactly which way that compass was pointing, letting actor Conleth Hill – who recently cleared up <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/game-thrones-coffee-cup-chaos-rages-lord-varys-star-conleth-hill-denies-emilia-clarke-accusations-11077195/">he was not behind the coffee cup calamity</a>, despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/game-of-thrones-star-emilia-clarke-reveals-true-identity-of-the-infamous-coffee-cup-cuplrit-11016008/">Emilia Clarke’s assurance that he was</a> – on a little secret the 55-year-old was summoned to keep until the Game of Thrones finale.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, it’s been almost six months since Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) became ruler of the Six Kingdoms, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) went off on her cruise and Jon Snow (Kit Harington) plunged a dagger into the heart of Daenerys, so Conleth is ready to spill.</p>
      <p>The entire Game of Thrones cast came together for a reunion special hosted by Conan O’Brien, which will only be made available on the complete DVD collection released next week, when the comedian in charge confirmed the letter’s existence to stars Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey.</p>
      <p>‘What the f**k?’ gasped Peter.</p>
      <p>‘Well it was in the form of an email,’ shuffled Conleth. ‘I could only reveal what was said once the show was done.’</p>

      <p>So what was in there?</p>
      <p>‘He said, ultimately, I’m a good person,’ the Northern Irish star spilled.</p>
      <p>The Game of Thrones reunion is full of mind-blowing new anecdotes.
