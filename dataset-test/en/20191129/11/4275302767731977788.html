      <h1>Dundee schools to give pupils who skip classes for climate change protest a black mark</h1>
      <h2>Dundee pupils who skip school to take part in another global day of climate strike action will have their absence treated as unauthorised.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:42:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/scottmilne/" target="_blank">Scott Milne</a></address>
      <p>Youths in Dundee are set to take to City Square again this afternoon to urge world leaders to take immediate action to help curb climate change.</p>
      <p>Hundreds took to the city centre earlier this year for similar reasons and Dundee City Council (DCC) accepted the resultant absences; as long as parents or guardians gave their permission.</p>
      <p>But for today’s action, and any other strikes that occur before the end of the school year, absences will not be authorised — even if parents and guardians say it is okay.</p>
      <p>The local authority declared a climate emergency earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The school climate strike movement gained momentum after Swedish teen Greta Thurnberg began protesting outside the Stockholm parliament last year.</p>
      <p>A DCC spokesman said: “Where young people decided to participate in the day of action in September, parental permission had to be received, as with any other school absence.</p>
      <p>“If this permission was received, absence from school on September 20 was regarded as authorised.</p>
      <p>“Where no parental permission was received, then it was treated as unauthorised.</p>
      <p>“Absence management is dealt with by individual schools in conjunction with parents.</p>
      <p>“Any absence from school for subsequent climate protests during school session 2019/20 will be treated by the school as unauthorised, even where parental permission is given.”</p>
