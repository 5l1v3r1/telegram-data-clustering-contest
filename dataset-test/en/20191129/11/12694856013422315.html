        <b>eBay has discounted the new iteration of Nintendo’s beloved hybrid console to celebrate <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-deals-live-today-3959264">Black Friday</a>, offering consumers a tidy discount on the original price. </b>
      </p>
      <p>At the time of writing, you can pick up the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-lite"/><a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-lite">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> console in either of its three colours for just £179.99, a nice decrease compared to the usual retail price, and exactly £100 less than its older sibling. </p>

      <p>The family of consoles has been around for almost three years now, with the Switch Lite arriving in recent months as a way of offering an experience that is purely handheld, removing the ability of docking to a larger display in exchange for a cheaper price and more attractive form factor.</p>
      <p>Since launching, the Nintendo Switch has compiled an absolutely fantastic library of exclusive games including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and more. This list is only set to expand further in the coming months, with so many surprises on the horizon we’re eager to hear about.</p>
      <p>‘The Nintendo Switch Lite is an excellent portable console that refines the display, buttons and overall form factor of its older sibling. However, the sacrifice of docked play will be a deal-breaker for some,’ reads our 4/5 review by yours truly.</p>

      <p>‘If you’re yet to purchase a Switch, though, and are purely interested in portable play without the need for local multiplayer, the Nintendo Switch Lite is a no-brainer.’ The Switch Lite is such a lovely console, and difficult not to recommend with a small yet meaningful discount like this.</p>
