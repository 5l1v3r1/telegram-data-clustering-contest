        <p>On the Quest front, <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/get-the-complete-vader-immortal-a-vr-star-wars-series-saga-free-with-purchase-of-oculus-quest/">Oculus announced</a> it'll be offering the new <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2223615721048141/">Star Wars: Vader Immortal $10 an episode series</a> for free with purchase of an Oculus Quest starting November 21st at 9 a.m. through January.</p>
        <p>Let's cut the preamble and get straight to the Oculus Black Friday deals you're searching for.</p>
        <h4>Oculus Rift and Rift S Black Friday deals</h4>

        <p>Amazon's Early Black Friday deals have already kicked off in the US and UK. Right now, you can save $50/£50 on the Oculus Rift S, bringing it down to $349/£349. This is the first time the new Oculus Rift S has been discounted by Amazon, bringing it down to its lowest price yet.</p>

        <h4>Oculus Go Black Friday deals</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.wareable.com/media/images/2019/10/33710-original-1571653103-SRkq-column-width-inline.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The cheapest option in the Oculus range, the Go is another wire-free headset but geared more towards media consumption than gaming (pick up a Quest if you really want wire-free games).</p>

          <p>Amazon has just wiped $50 off the price of the Oculus Go 32GB model, bringing it down to a record low price for Black Friday.</p>

          <p>Like the Oculus Rift S, Amazon UK has already discounted the Oculus Go for its Early Black Friday deals. You can pick one up for just £149 for the 32GB model. That's £50 off (-25) and cheaper than the Oculus Go was sold during Prime Day earlier in the year.</p>

          <h4>Oculus Quest Black Friday deals</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://www.wareable.com/media/images/2019/10/oculus-quest-4040-1556640249-tujj-full-width-inline-1571653426-B70H-column-width-inline.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Arguably the most tempting headset from Oculus now – especially as Oculus recently announced <a href="https://www.wareable.com/vr/oculus-connect-6-news-announcements-7645">Oculus Link</a>, which essentially turns the Quest into a PC-connected Rift. This gives you the best of both worlds – a wireless VR experience and a PC-tethered one when you want the extra processing power.</p>
          <p>The Oculus Quest was only released earlier in the year with the same $399 price point as the Rift S, which makes it trickier to make any predictions. The Quest hasn't shifted at all from its full RRP in the few months since its release.</p>
          <p>While no deals have been released just yet, <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/get-the-complete-vader-immortal-a-vr-star-wars-series-saga-free-with-purchase-of-oculus-quest/">Oculus announced</a> it'll be offering the new <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2223615721048141/">Star Wars: Vader Immortal $10 an episode series</a> for free with purchase of an Oculus Quest starting November 21st at 9 a.m. through January. We checked it out and it looks awesome, you can preview the series <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2223615721048141/">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Still, we wouldn't be too surprised to see another deal around the $349 mark. For the money, these could fly off the shelves – digital or otherwise.</p>

          <h4>Oculus games Black Friday deals</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://www.wareable.com/media/images/2019/10/oculus-homescreen-1525199377-e8xc-full-width-inline-1563211551-9k0b-column-width-inline-1571653670-HLIk-column-width-inline.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Last year, there was a sale at the Oculus Store, discounting a whole range of games with daily deals as part of a Fall into Fun promotion. There was also a special <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/193205901596389/">Black Friday Premium Pack</a> that bundled seven games with a special discounted price.</p>
          <p>There's a good chance similar promotions will be put on this year, so keep your eyes peeled if you're looking to pad out your library.</p>
          <h4>When is Oculus Black Friday 2019?</h4>
          <p>The date you need to keep in mind is Friday 29 November for Black Friday itself, but expect the Oculus deals to roll in throughout the month of November in the build up. Discounts should also continue through the weekend after Black Friday into Cyber Monday on 2 December.</p>
          <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
          <p>If you're looking towards Amazon for Black Friday deals on Oculus HMDs, then you'll want to factor in 22 November through to Black Friday on 29 November. That's because the retailer has just announced a whopping eight days worth of deals.</p>
          <h3>Where to find the best Oculus Black Friday deals</h3>
          <p>As mentioned, Amazon will undoubtedly be a good source of Oculus deals. There will also be discounts direct from the Oculus.com store, although these might not be as competitive as from other retailers. Lenovo will be where you will want to go for its $349 discount on the Oculus Rift S, too. It could prove fruitful for other Oculus headsets.</p>
          <p>Now all that's left is to wait for Black Friday to kick off. Be sure to check back here throughout November for all the very best Oculus Black Friday deals.</p>
