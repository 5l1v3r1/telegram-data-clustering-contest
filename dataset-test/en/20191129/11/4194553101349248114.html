      <h1>Sadio Mane set to sign massive deal that proves he’s one of world’s biggest draws</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:41:27+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Sadio Mane could be about to pen one of the biggest boot deals in football history with Puma.</p>
      <p>That’s according to John Cross in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sadio-mane-lined-up-eight-20982263">Mirror</a>, who says the football giant wants to secure Mane’s allegiance and get him to switch from New Balance.</p>
      <p>Mane will be paid a monumental eight-figure fee, likely over a number of years, for his affiliation.</p>
      <p>Cross states Mane’s draw as Africa’s biggest and most marketable player is the reason for Puma’s interest, with the manufacturer recently securing Raheem Sterling as well.</p>
      <p>Mane is indeed a global superstar. He jointly won last season’s Premier League Golden Boot, was instrumental in helping fire Liverpool to Champions League glory and got Senegal to the final of the AFCON…</p>
      <p>We’d argue he should be in contention for the Ballon d’Or, actually, but it’s either going to be Lionel Messi of Barcelona or Mane’s team-mate Virgil van Dijk – which we’d have no problems with of course!</p>
      <p>Mane is our most influential attacker right now, which is some compliment considering he plays alongside Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino.</p>
      <p>Any financial boost he gets, he deserves. He’s one of the nicest, most humble people in football.</p>
