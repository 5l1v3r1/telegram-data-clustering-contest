      <p>The credit union has provided €5.8 million in loans to the local community over the past year. Membership has grown and it now holds total assets of €70 million.  </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tipperarylive.ie/">Carrick-on-Suir</a> Credit Union will continue to be open for lending for 2020. The credit union encourages members to come to it first when they need credit for a car, holiday, home improvements or college fees.</p>
      <p>The credit union is also pleased to announce that it will be proposing a loan interest rebate of 15% this year to its valued members. This is the fifth year in a row that the credit union is offering its members a return on borrowing from them with the loan interest rebate.

      <p>A 15% loan interest rebate and a 0.1% dividend rate will be presented to the credit union AGM for approval on December 9. </p>
