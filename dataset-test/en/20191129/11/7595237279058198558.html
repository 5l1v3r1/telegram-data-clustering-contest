      <p>Scientists have discovered the perfectly preserved body of a puppy believed to be more than 18,000 years old in a remote part of northeast Siberia.</p>
      <p>The discovery was made in the summer of 2018, two hours from Belaya Gora, in the Sakha Republic of Russia, by a team of researchers from Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>The male puppy appears to have been just two months old when it died, and lay undisturbed in permafrost, according to the Siberian Times.</p>

      <p>Genome analysis in recent months uncovered that the pup was a male, according to the CPG, who added that the pup had been named Dogor, the Yakutian word for friend, by colleagues in Russia.</p>
      <p>Even at 18,000 years old, Dogor is a mere pup compared to a previous discovery in Siberia - <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/newslens/2019/0614/1055308-russia-wolf-head/">when a 40,000-year-old wolf's head was found</a>.</p>
