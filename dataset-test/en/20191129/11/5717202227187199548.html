      <h1>Arsenal fans heap praise on Frankfurt star Daichi Kamada despite him scoring twice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:45:14+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Daichi Kamada put Arsenal to the sword as he scored two stunning goals for Eintracht Frankfurt and earn all three points at the Emirates Stadium – and Arsenal fans have thanked the Japanese ace.</p>
      <p>Kamada, 23, joined Frankfurt in the summer of 2017 and struggled in his first season – managing just four appearances. It saw him move on loan to Belgian outlet Sint Truiden throughout 2018-19. He scored 16 goals from attacking midfield.</p>
      <p>That form saw him given a go in Frankfurt’s side this season, and he has certainly repaid Adi Hutter’s men. This season, he has clocked up 24 appearances and had a hand in nine goals – including his brace against Arsenal on Thursday night.</p>

      <p>Arsenal had taken the lead in first-half injury time through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but Frankfurt looked like a completely different team in the second half. They had the Gunners pegged back inside their own half for much of the second 45.</p>
      <p>The Japanese ace picked the ball up on the edge of the area, cutting inside from the right flank. He lashed a shot into the far corner past Emi Martinez with his stronger left foot. His second came from an Arsenal corner.</p>
      <p>Kamada was afforded an enormous amount of time after Arsenal headed a corner to the edge of the box, and using his right foot, the playmaker picked his spot to earn all three points. Arsenal fans have surprisingly thanked him, though.</p>
      <p>That is because Arsenal supporters believe Kamada is the reason for Emery finally being sacked, after coming under pressure throughout the entire campaign. Emery was sacked on Friday morning, following the defeat.</p>
