      <p>"I will be the first to tell you he is not the easiest to live with. Not doing the dishes after dinner is a daily struggle, so I feel for you, Caitlyn," she said.</p>
      <aside>Is it bullying? No, not at all. He’s a grown-up man. They’re all fine.</aside>
      <p>Andrew and Suraya – who married in 2016 – have three children together.</p>
