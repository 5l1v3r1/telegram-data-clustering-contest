      <p>Sia pretended to win the lottery on Thanksgiving so she could treat a number of people to their shopping.</p>
      <p>The Chandelier singer has mostly kept her identity a mystery by wearing an iconic wig that pretty much covers her entire face.</p>
      <p>So when she entered the supermarket on Thursday afternoon, the star pretty much went unnoticed.</p>
      <p>That is until she offered to buy everyone’s food.</p>
      <p>Telling people that her name was Cici, the 43-year-old wafted her card in the air as she went from till to till, tapping in her pin as she celebrated her historic day.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t until after she left the shop that videos of her good deed appeared online, with fans praising the star on her generosity.</p>

      <p>‘So @Sia paid for my groceries today thank you so much!! The heart and beautiful soul you have for paying for everyone,’ one wrote alongside a clip of the Cheap Thrills hitmaker.</p>
      <p>‘I’m sorry for telling everyone once I realised who you were !! But this kindness must be acknowledged!!!’</p>
      <p>Right on cue, followers started to comment where they flocked to champion Sia.</p>

      <p>‘Absolutely an amazing human being,’ one wrote while another added: ‘That’s freaking amazing, you guys were so lucky!!’</p>
      <p>Someone else said: ‘Omg this woman is the kindest person in the world.’</p>
      <p>Sia is yet to comment on her random act of kindness, but it seems the people she helped were more than grateful and even bought the star flowers to say thank you.</p>
      <p>Just recently, the Elastic Heart songstress reached out to her fans as she revealed she is suffering from the condition Ehlers Danlos.</p>
      <p>‘Hey, I’m suffering with chronic pain, a neurological disease, ehlers danlos and I just wanted to say to those of you suffering from pain, whether physical or emotional, I love you, keep going,’ she tweeted.</p>
      <p>‘Life is f**king hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you’re not alone.’</p>
