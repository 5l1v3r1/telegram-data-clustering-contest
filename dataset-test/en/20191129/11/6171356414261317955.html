      <h1>Get the excellent Samsung Galaxy Watch Active for $150 ($50 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:38:24+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/rita/" target="_blank">Rita El Khoury</a></address>
      <p>Android-compatible smartwatches are a dime a dozen, but good ones with a good balance of features, responsive UX, and battery life are hard to come by. Among these rarities are Samsung's Tizen smartwatches, and today you can get the fantastic Galaxy Watch Active for $150, an all-time low price.</p>
      <p>The Watch Active was announced along the Galaxy S10, so it's not even a year old yet. The <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/09/galaxy-watch-active2-review-dancing-on-the-grave-of-wear-os/">Watch Active2</a> was released after it and cost $80 more, which is why the first model remains an appealing choice, especially since most issues we found with it during <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/04/04/samsungs-galaxy-watch-active-is-a-great-smartwatch-especially-for-200/">our initial review</a> have now been ironed: it has received an update that <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/galaxy-watch-watch-active-update/">enables a rotating bezel and adds more watchfaces</a>, and it's also got <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/23/latest-galaxy-watch-active-update-adds-night-mode-and-makes-swim-tracking-a-whole-lot-better/">better swim tracking</a> if you care about that.</p>
      <p>With the $50 discount, the Watch Active becomes an excellent value and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/05/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-drops-to-180-20-off-at-multiple-retailers/">$30 less</a> than the last time weÂ saw a deal for it.</p>
