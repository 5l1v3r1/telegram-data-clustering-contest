      <h1>Mum shares heart-wrenching photos to show the 'reality of childhood cancer'</h1>
      <h2>Sophia Soto was just 14 months old when she was diagnosed with cancer, beginning six months of gruelling treatment during which the little girl endured 60 rounds of chemotherapy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:06:32+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>The family of a little girl who was diagnosed with cancer at just 14 months old have released a photo of her undergoing treatment to show the devastating effects of childhood cancer.</p>
      <p>Sophia Soto was found to have Stage 4 Neuroblastoma shortly after her first birthday when tumours were discovered behind her eyes and on her kidney.</p>
      <p>It began a relentless six month period of treatment, during which brave Sophia endured 60 rounds of chemotherapy, 20 rounds of radiation and a stem cell transplant.</p>
      <p>Sophia battled through and has now been in remission for five years, unrecognisable from the girl who appears in the heartbreaking images from March 2014.</p>
      <p>Her mum, Rosie, says no one could imagine what her six-year-old daughter, and herself as a parent, have been through looking at her now.</p>

      <p>"The picture of Sophia upset really does home in on the reality of childhood cancer," she said.Â </p>
      <p>"She was having a lead put on her chest for her treatment - which she didn't want - hence why Sophia was so upset.</p>
      <p>"I look back at the picture now and wonder how I did it; it was so hard watching my little girl so ill."</p>
      <p>Rosie, from Florida, became concerned about her young daughter after noticing she was developing bruising around her eyes, which she claims doctors dismissed as a result of a bump or fall.</p>
      <p>The mum followed her instincts and continued to search for an answer, taking Sophia to an eye specialist who 'knew straight away' the bruising was being caused by tumours.</p>

      <p>Rosie continued: "Sophia kept getting bruising on her eyes and I didn't recall her falling over or anything, so I didn't understand where they were coming from.</p>
      <p>"I kept taking her to the doctors because the bruising wasn't going away, but they just said it must have been from a bump or something.</p>
      <p>"Sophia wasn't referred for a scan or biopsy until I went to see an eye specialist.</p>
      <p>"She was sent for an MRI where black spots appeared on the scans confirming the tumours behind her eyes.</p>
      <p>"It was then the biopsy which found the tumours on one of her kidneys as well which led to her stage 4 Neuroblastoma diagnosis."</p>

      <p>Following half a year of gruelling treatment, Sophia has been in remission since November 2014 and has now been medication free for two years.</p>
      <p>The youngster, who loves to dance and has dreams of becoming a vet, isn't yet classified as 'cancer free' and still requires check ups every six months.</p>
      <p>The tumours remain behind Sophia's eyes, which cannot be removed due to their placement, but doctors believe they are benign and not causing harm.</p>
      <p>"Doctors are reluctant to remove the tumours Sophia currently has behind her eyes as they've said it would be likely the surgery to disfigure her face," said Rosie.</p>

      <p>"Whilst they are tumours, doctors are reasonably confident that they are not cancerous so we have decided to not have the surgery right now, but it may be something she has when she's older.</p>
      <p>"No one can imagine what she went through looking at her now - she just looks like a normal regular child.</p>
      <p>"Sophia has her moments when she asks about when she was sick and has questions about her treatment scars, but overall she's a pretty happy girl.</p>
      <p>"If I was to say anything to other parents with children battling cancer, I'd say to them to not give up, stay positive and keep your faith.</p>
      <p>"It's really important not to compare your child's process to anyone else as everyone battles illnesses differently as every situation is different.</p>
      <p>"We're over the moon that Sophia is now doing so well - we're really blessed that she's such a fighter."</p>
