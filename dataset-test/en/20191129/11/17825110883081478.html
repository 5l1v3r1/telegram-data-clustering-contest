      <p>Cape Town - As people jostle each other to get their hands on Black Friday specials, customers are warned to keep their valuables safe from pickpockets.</p>
      <p>Willie Peters, general manager: marketing at Shoprite and Checkers said they had done extensive planning ahead of Black Friday to ensure stores operate optimally while prioritising customers’ safety.</p>
      <p>“Although criminal activities are generally no more of an issue on Black Friday than any other trading day in our business, additional security are employed to ensure customers have a safe shopping experience,” he said.</p>
      <p>John Bradshaw, marketing retail executive at Pick n Pay said: “Our advice to shoppers on Black Friday is the same as for any normal shopping day - we encourage customers to take care of their belongings at all times.</p>
      <p>“A good example is not to leave handbags or other bags in unattended trolleys while shopping.”</p>
