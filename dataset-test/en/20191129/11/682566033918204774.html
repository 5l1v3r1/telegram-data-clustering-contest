      <p>Cape Town - <b>Sadio Mane</b> is adamant <b>Liverpool's </b>front three are not feeling any physical fatigue, saying "the tiredness is in the head".</p>
      <p>Mane, <b>Mohamed Salah</b> and <b>Roberto Firmino</b> start virtually every match for <b>Jurgen Klopp's</b> side but that, plus their international commitments, means the numbers they are racking up are significant.</p>
      <p>Senegal international Mane has played 131 matches for club and country since the start of the 2017-18 season, Egypt's Mohamed Salah has 133 while Brazilian Roberto Firmino has a remarkable 149 appearances.</p>
      <p>Mane certainly does not seem to be showing any signs of fatigue affecting his form with the 27-year-old having scored 12 times in 19 games.</p>
      <p>"I think it is here," he said, tapping the side of his head.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, I think it is all in the head. The tiredness is in the head, so as long as the body recovers well, I think it is not difficult for us to play every single game if the team needs us and the coach needs us.</p>
      <p>"I think we will be able to play and help the team. When they need me, I will be ready for the team to give everything.</p>
      <p>"The coach has to decide who will play but I am here to work every single day, and to be every single day to be ready to go again."</p>
      <p>Liverpool are going to need that indefatigably over the next couple of months as they are currently two matches into a 14-game stretch in 43 days up to and including their entry into the FA Cup in the first week of January.</p>
      <p>That also includes two matches in 24 hours on different continents because of their involvement in the Carabao Cup and Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Should they progress through the League Cup quarter-final tie at Aston Villa in December they would then face a two-legged semi-final, meaning potentially a further seven matches in a month.</p>
      <p>Mane will be in the squad which travels to Qatar for the Club World Cup as Liverpool seek to claim a trophy they have never won before.</p>
      <p>"I always say to win games and win trophies, motivates players all the time," added Mane.</p>
      <p>"If we can win the Club World Cup then it will give us more momentum.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully we are going to win it and give us another blast of high energy to go again for the rest of the season."</p>
