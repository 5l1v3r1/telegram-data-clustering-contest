      <p>Brad Gobright, 31, had been abseiling down a cliff face in El Portero Chico alongside fellow climber Aidan Jacobson, 26, when they lost their grip.</p>
      <p>Jacobson fortunately survived after his fall was broken by a bush, escaping with just an ankle injury. However, Gobright tragically lost his life.</p>

      <p>Gobright and Jacobson had been attempting to scale a route called El Sendero Luminoso, a 2,500-foot rock climb known to be among the toughest routes in the region.</p>
      <p>They had been using a technique known as simul-abseiling, where two climbers descend using opposite strands of a rope while acting as each other’s counterweights.</p>
      <p>As reported by <i><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2406215/brad-gobright-climber-dies#close">Outside</a></i> magazine, the two men hadn’t tied ‘stopper knots’ at the ends of their ropes, a measure that may have proven life-saving.</p>
      <p>Nearly all rappelling deaths are due to climbers failing to tie stopper knots, with many reportedly abstaining from tying stopper knots as they can lead to ropes getting stuck.</p>

      <p>Jacobson explained they hadn’t pulled their rope to its midpoint, saying: ‘Since it was such a short rap, we figured we’d be fine with an 80-meter rope.’</p>
      <p>His side had been touching down on the ledge while Gobright’s side became tangled up in a bush towards to the side.</p>

      <blockquote>I asked if we were good, and he said, ‘Yes, we can untangle the rope on the way down.’<br/><br/>We didn’t tie knots in the rope, either. We started rapping. I was a bit above him. I was on the left. He was on the right. Then all of a sudden, I felt a pop, and we started dropping.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>It was basically a blur.<br/><br/>He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge…</blockquote>

      <blockquote>I’m so sorry to hear that @bradgobright just died in a climbing accident. He was such a warm, kind soul – one of a handful of partners that I always loved spending a day with.<br/><br/>I suppose there’s something to be said about being safe out there and the inherent risks in climbing but I don’t really care about that right now.<br/><br/>I’m just sad for Brad and his family. And for all of us who were so positively affected by his life. So crushing. Brad was a real gem of a man. For all his strengths and weaknesses (like his insanely strong fingers, or living out of a Honda Civic…) at the core he was just a good guy.<br/><br/>I guess there’s nothing really to say. I’m sad. The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace…</blockquote>
