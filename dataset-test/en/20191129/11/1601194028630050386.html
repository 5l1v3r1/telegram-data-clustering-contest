      <p>Sri Lanka have named a full-strength squad for the first Tests to be played in Pakistan in a decade.</p>
      <p>Ten high-profile players opted not to tour when Sri Lanka visited Pakistan for three one-day internationals and three T20s in September and October, with limited-overs captains Dimuth Karunaratne and Lasith Malinga among those absent.</p>
      <p>However, Karunaratne will skipper a strong group that also includes Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal for the two Tests in Rawalpindi and Karachi.</p>
      <p>The only change to the Sri Lanka squad that faced New Zealand in August sees Kasun Rajitha replace Akila Dananjaya, who is serving a one-year ban for an illegal action.</p>

      <p>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
      <p>Pakistan have not hosted a five-day game since several Sri Lanka players and members of their coaching staff were injured in an attack on their team bus in March 2009.</p>
      <p>These two Tests were originally scheduled to be hosted at a neutral venue because of security concerns but will now take place in Pakistan following the success of the limited-overs games in the country.</p>
      <p>The first Test begins on December 11 in Rawalpindi.</p>
