      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>’s White House has “engaged in unprecedented obstruction”, former acting solicitor general <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/neal-katyal">Neal Katyal</a> has declared in a damning interview with MSNBC, as the White House admits it has no record of a key call between the president and EU ambassador <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> that Republicans had hoped would exonerate him.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump made a surprise <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> visit to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> on Thursday, serving turkey to American troops at the Bagram Air Field and pledging to resume peace talks with the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Taliban">Taliban</a> just three months after declaring the process “dead”.</p>
      <p>His inner circle had gone to some lengths to conceal the trip from the media, sending out Mr Trump’s motorcade to his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, as a red herring after the president tweeted a picture of his head Photoshopped onto a shot of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> in character as underdog boxer Rocky Balboa to serve as a distraction.</p>
