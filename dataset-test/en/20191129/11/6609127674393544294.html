        <b>LAZIO boss Simone Inzaghi has begged Celtic to do them a favour by beating Cluj in the final game in their Europa League group and he's backed Neil Lennon's men to save their skin.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4940138/celtic-rangers-europa-league-last-32-potential-opponents-draw-date/">Celtic</a> qualified with two games to go and have already topped the group after a stunning campaign, which included a home and away success against Lazio.</p>

      <p>Lazio now must beat Rennes in France and pray the Hoops can go to Romania and win, even though Cluj need just a point to qualify and it's a dead rubber match for Celtic.</p>
      <p>And it's unlikely too many Celtic fans would shed a tear for Lazio if they didn't qualify following two clashes containing plenty of ugly off-field incidents.</p>
      <p>But Inzaghi insists he has every faith in Celtic.</p>
      <p>He said: "First of all, we have to do our duty in France. There's no point worrying about what is happening in the other game if we can't beat Rennes.</p>
      <p>"Celtic have given everything in this group and I believe they will do this also in Romania.</p>
      <p>"I believe it's the mindset of the Scots to try and win every match and we have to hope they will do that and win at Cluj.</p>
      <p>"In football, nothing is impossible. We have to keep believing we will qualify.</p>
      <p>"Celtic won at the Stadio Olimpico so they can certainly also win at Cluj. Like I say, it won't matter if we cannot beat Rennes. Let's do our job there and see what happens."</p>
      <p>The Hoops were fined £13,000 by Uefa over 'illicit banners' and 'illicit chants' from their supporters during their 2-1 win over Lazio at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>The section of the ground which hosts the Green Brigade <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10210270/celtic-lazio-uefa-banners/">displayed a series of controversial banners throughout the match</a>.</p>
      <p>They displayed a "Brigate Verde" tifo which bore a striking resemblance to Italian left-wing organisation Brigate Rosse.</p>
      <p>A flag depicting former dictator Mussolini's hanging was also unveiled with the words "follow your leader" <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10223473/celtic-slam-mussolini-granddaughter-f-off/">which led to the former Italian prime minister's granddaughter hitting out at Celts supporters.</a></p>
      <p>There were also messages which translated to "f*** Lazio" and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4876017/celtic-lazio-europa-league-green-brigade/">"Laziale Parto Anale" which roughly translates to "Lazio fans are birthed anally"</a>.</p>
      <p>Trouble also flared in Rome with<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4930120/celtic-lazio-rome-man-stabbed-third-attack/"> Celtic fans stabbed</a> while <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4925123/lazio-thugs-stab-celtic-supporters-attack-bar-hoops/">armed hooligans attacked a bar full of Bhoys supporters.</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lazio and Italy midfielder Marco Parolo was still complaining about the Hoops' double success against them.</p>
      <p>He said: "We collected zero points against Celtic despite clearly not being inferior to them and that's what has cost us.</p>
      <p>"The first defeat against Cluj was one of these things, but losing home and away to Celtic is something that should never have happened."</p>
