      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: China’s telecommunication giant China Mobile, through its overseas subsidiary China Mobile International (CMI), has officially launched the group’s first ever global shared service senter (SSC) in Cyberjaya marking a new chapter in CMI’s ambitious plan for expansion in to the region.</p>
      <p>Tapping into the large pool of talents available in Malaysia, CMI latest operation here, which will be based at CMI’s existing offices at i-Tech Tower, will handle the group’s finance, legal and human resources with more functions to come.</p>
      <p>"With the presence of CMI in Malaysia providing various shared services, the Government envisages further enhancement to local technological capabilities, especially for Industry 4.0.</p>
      <p>"As you all may be aware, IR 4.0 technology has been supporting the development of Malaysia’s digital and telecommunication industry and has been identified as one of the key enablers for industrial development in Malaysia, for both the manufacturing and services industries,” said International Trade and Industry deputy minister Dr Ong Kian Ming who officiated the the opening ceremony here recently.</p>
      <p>He took the opportunity to thank CMI for their vote of confidence in Malaysia by choosing to locate the company’s first SSC here.</p>
      <p>Also presence at the event include Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) chief operating officer Dato’ Ng Wan Peng, Cyberview Sdn Bhd managing director</p>
      <p>Mohd Najib Ibrahim and director, CMI executive vice president &amp; chief financial officer Lei Liqun.</p>
      <p>Lei said it is timely for CMI to expand with this SSC to leverage on highly sought-after multi-lingual capabilities, well established infrastructures and strong government support for the centralisation of its global legal, HR and finance functions.</p>
      <p>“Going forward, the SSC is expected to play a pivotal role in increasing the efficiencies in the overall operation of CMI’s core businesses.</p>
      <p>"As one of the biggest operators for telecommunication business in the world, we are confident that CMI will be the ideal way for us to increase the value that we provide to our customers and services globally," said Lei.</p>
      <p>Further, the presence of CMI’s SSC, Ng said, is a further testament to Malaysia’s increasing attractiveness as a strategic location for digital services powered by Industry 4.0 technologies such as automation and data analytics.</p>
      <p>"MDEC firmly believes that by investing in Malaysia, CMI will bring in its knowledge and expertise to this country’s tech talent and innovation ecosystem, thereby benefiting Malaysia as we progress towards becoming a high-income nation,” said Ng.</p>
      <p>CMI Malaysia managing director Hew Chee Chung said as a forward-thinking global firm, CMI always takes the opportunity to look not only at how some key tasks can be performed more efficiently.</p>
      <p>CMI first established its operation in Malaysia more than three years ago, offering the company’s cutting-edge technologies, global operating experience and unparalleled information technology (IT) solutions.</p>
