      <h1>OPINION: Blackpool’s squad needs some extra strength for a promotion push</h1>
      <h2>When Simon Grayson added the finishing touches to his squad during the summer the boast was loud and clear: ‘look how impressive Blackpool’s strength in depth is’.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:45:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Scrafton</a></address>
      <p>If the midweek EFL Trophy exit teaches us anything, it might be that Pool’s squad isn’t quite as strong as we previously thought.</p>
      <p>This is not a column that will be all doom and gloom, because the Seasiders’ starting XI is a strong one – as demonstrated by recent results, which saw Pool enjoy a seven-game unbeaten run before coming unstuck against Scunthorpe United.</p>
      <p>I remain of the belief that Pool can launch a genuine tilt at the League One play-offs this season, as I outlined before a ball was even kicked.</p>
      <p>I predicted it would be a case of staying in and around the top 10 until January, when Grayson can make the necessary additions to bolster his options.</p>
      <p>Nothing I’ve witnessed in the opening third of the campaign has altered that view.</p>
      <p>But beyond a core group of 14 or 15 players, is the required quality there to be called upon should it be needed? The jury is out.</p>
      <p>Those players who are outside the reckoning when it comes to the first team probably answered that question for us on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>While the EFL Trophy is largely an irrelevance, it is a competition that presented opportunities to stake a claim for players including Mark Howard, Rocky Bushiri, Curtis Tilt, Ollie Turton, Callum Guy, Sean Scannell, Ryan Hardie and Joe Nuttall.</p>
      <p>Without singling out individuals, put it this way, I’d be surprised if – Nuttall aside – any of those players are to start in Sunday’s FA Cup second round tie against Maidstone United.</p>
      <p>That’s not to say Nuttall was particularly impressive against Scunthorpe, because I thought he struggled.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t the only one, mind; from back to front it was a dire performance.</p>
      <p>Nuttall is still yet to fully settle on the Fylde coast after his big money move from Blackburn Rovers during the summer.</p>
      <p>To his credit, while his all-round displays haven’t been stellar, he has capitalised on Armand Gnanduillet’s thigh injury with two goals in as many games during this past week.</p>
      <p>His midweek strike partner, meanwhile, continues to look bereft of confidence despite his recent hat-trick in the reserves.</p>
      <p>It just hasn’t happened for Hardie in tangerine so far this season.</p>
      <p>Admittedly chances have been hard to come by, but when he has appeared, he’s been well below par on each occasion.</p>
      <p>He’s still young and I do believe there’s a good finisher in him, but currently he’s not getting himself into goalscoring positions and is also being bullied off the ball far too easily.</p>
      <p>I can imagine those at the top of the club’s hierarchy are not exactly impressed with the form of the two strikers – especially given the sizeable outlay that was required to bring them to Bloomfield Road.</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping the duo can put their struggles behind them and go on to play a part in Blackpool’s success in the coming years.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Tilt still isn’t looking like the player that we all know he can be.</p>
      <p>He’s being kept out of the back three by James Husband, a full-back by trade, and can have no complaints given the impressive recent displays from the on-loan Norwich City man.</p>
      <p>Has Tilt’s head been turned? Has he already decided to leave the club, be it in January or at the end of the season? We can only speculate.</p>
      <p>But what we do know is that his displays this season have been nowhere near what we’ve come to expect.</p>
      <p>Tilt, at his best, is among the leading centre-backs in the third tier.</p>
      <p>In other news, it was encouraging and heartening to see the club produce such a swift response to the video footage that emerged online after Wednesday’s game.</p>
      <p>I know they were made aware of it very quickly and it’s since been flagged up to the police, so the appropriate channels have certainly been followed.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately this isn’t an isolated incident as there have already been a few flashpoints this season.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, an undercurrent appears to have developed between a minority of supporters, police and stewards.</p>
      <p>Why this is, I’m not entirely sure. One would hope the ousting of the despised previous owners would have brought unity to the club and the wider community.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, those ill feelings will die down and we can concentrate on what is happening on the pitch, rather than off it, in what promises to be an exciting 2020.</p>
