      <p>The Powerbeats Pro wireless earphones are amongst the more expensive wireless earphones you can find. Well, if you're interested in the Powerbeats Pro, you'll be glad to know that they're not <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounted</a> for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>These earphones are now available over at Amazon for $199.95. That is the lowest price tag that Beats ever put on these earphones. They usually cost $249.95, by the way. This is a $50 discount on these earbuds, or in other words, a 20-percent discount.</p>
