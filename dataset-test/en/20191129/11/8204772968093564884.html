      <h2>John Wilson’s wines for the weekend: A French Pinot Gris, an Australian Pinot Noir</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/john-wilson-7.1837442" target="_blank">John Wilson</a></address>
      <p>This week, two wines from Aldi’s Exquisite Collection range. The Australian Pinot Noir is a new addition; the Pinot Gris is an improved version of the previous Alsace Pinot Gris.</p>
      <p><b>Exquisite Collection Pinot Gris, €9.99</b><br/>Pinot Gris is the same grape as Pinot Grigio. Plump, mouth-watering melon and peach fruits balanced nicely by a lively fresh acidity. At a mere 12.5 per cent alcohol, this would make a great party wine, and would also go nicely with quiches, savoury tarts and lighter salads.</p>
