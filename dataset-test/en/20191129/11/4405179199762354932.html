      <h1>Black Friday deal: Save £80 on iPhone XR with Argos</h1>
      <h2>Argos has knocked a further £80 off the iPhone XR, a great-value handset that already received a price cut this autumn. Grab this excellent deal now!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:16:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/david-price/" target="_blank">David Price</a></address>
      <p>Argos has cut the price of the iPhone XR <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/41-3779073-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8663841">to just £549</a> as part of its Black Friday sale. That's £80 off Apple's current price, which itself saw a cut in September when the iPhone 11 came out. Just a few months ago the XR cost £749, and this is an excellent deal.</p>
      <p>Note that Amazon is currently <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-XR-64GB-White/dp/B07JZVDRKD?ascsubtag=41-3779073-11-0000000">matching the deal</a>, although several of the colour finishes have sold out. At time of writing the site has blue, coral and yellow options (in the £549 64GB option), but not black, red or white.</p>
      <p>This is the lowest price we've seen on the iPhone XR. For comparison, here are the latest prices from a range of retailers, which you'll see rounded up in our guide to the <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/iphone-xr-deals-3685300/">best iPhone XR deals</a>:</p>

      <p>The iPhone XR came out in autumn 2018 so, despite still being sold by Apple, it can no longer be considered cutting-edge. But it's still a powerful device as well as a user-friendly one; indeed, in our current <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/iphone-buying-guide-3448467/">iPhone buying guide</a> this is our second recommendation (after the iPhone 11) and we believe it's the one that's best for buyers on a budget. This new deal reinforces that belief.</p>
