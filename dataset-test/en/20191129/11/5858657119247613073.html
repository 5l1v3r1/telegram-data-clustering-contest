      <p>VANCOUVER — The RCMP in British Columbia say a man is in custody and facing a murder charge in the homicide of a 23-year-old woman in Vancouver in 1993.</p>
      <p>The Mounties announced in a news release Friday that Stephen Laroche has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Vicki Black.</p>
      <p>They say a Vancouver police review led to the file being transferred to the provincial unsolved homicide unit.</p>
      <p>Vancouver police had already identified a suspect and the unsolved homicide unit worked to gather enough evidence to support a charge.</p>
      <p>As a result, the new release says Laroche was arrested in Oakville, Ont., with the help of Hamilton police, and appeared in a Vancouver courtroom on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>His next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 2.</p>
      <p>Black’s family says in a statement that she was a loving daughter, sister, mother and friend.</p>
      <p>“Her family wish to thank the members of the provincial unsolved homicide unit and all those involved in the investigation that has led to this arrest.”</p>
      <p>Chief Supt. Manny Mann, officer in charge of the RCMP’s major crime section, says he’s pleased the Mounties were able to announce charges 26 years after Black’s death.</p>
      <p>“No matter how many years pass by, police are committed to ensuring justice for victims of homicide,” he says.</p>
      <p>It’s important that those accused of serious criminal acts be held accountable, regardless of how long it takes, added Supt. Cita Airth of the Vancouver police.</p>
      <p>“It is our hope that today’s charges will bring some semblance of closure to Vicki’s family and friends.”</p>
