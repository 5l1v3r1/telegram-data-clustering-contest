      <h1>Three men jailed for Australia Christmas terror plot</h1>

      <p>Three men were jailed Friday for an IS-inspired terror plot to cause mass casualties in Australia’s second-largest city Melbourne during the 2016 Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Hamza Abbas, 24, Ahmed Mohamed, 27 and Abdullah Chaarani, 29, were found guilty last year of plotting to use machetes and homemade bombs to target major sites — including a train station and a church — in a December attack.</p>
      <p>In handing down the sentences judge Christopher Beale said the men had been accessing online material “supportive of Islamic State and violent jihad” in the lead-up to their arrest.</p>
      <p>Beale said the men came to believe their planned “mass slaughter of innocent civilians” would be a “glorious act”.</p>
      <p>“The stupidity of that belief was only matched by its malevolence,” Beale said.</p>
      <p>Abbas was sentenced for 22 years, while Mohamed and Chaarani, who were facing their second terror charge, were jailed for 38 years.</p>
      <p>Police uncovered the plot after monitoring the Australian-born men’s phone conversations, text messages and emails, and all four were arrested on December 22, 2016.</p>
      <p>Then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull called their plans “one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years”.</p>
