      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp">Johnny Depp</a> is producing a musical about the life of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson">Michael Jackson</a> that will be told from the perspective of the late singer’s famous sequin glove.</p>
      <p>Playwright Julien Nitzberg wrote For the Love of a Glove: An Unauthorised Musical Fable About the Life of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson">Michael Jackson</a>, As Told By His Glove, which is described as “a fresh, revisionist look at the strange forces that shaped Jackson and the scandals that bedevilled him”.</p>

      <p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/28/johnny-depp-producing-musical-about-michael-jackson/">Nitzberg told Page Six</a> that a major TV network had asked him to write a film about Jackson, but it pulled out after Nitberg and the network couldn’t agree about how to cover <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/09/america-michael-jackson-pop-legacy-leaving-neverland">allegations of child abuse against the singer</a>.</p>
      <p>Nitzberg proposed a solution: “I said, how’s this? Everything MJ has been accused of has actually been caused by his glove, which is actually an alien from outer space [and] feeds on virgin boy blood. They laughed and said, ‘Can you do the normal version?’”</p>
      <p>The playwright turned down the TV network’s offer and decided to write the idea for the stage. Nitzberg began working with Depp’s production company, Infinitum Nihil, on a biopic of 1960s one-hit wonder Tiny Tim.</p>
      <p>It is the latest project about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/01/leaving-neverland-is-it-still-ok-to-listen-to-michael-jackson">the </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/01/leaving-neverland-is-it-still-ok-to-listen-to-michael-jackson">late pop star</a> to enter production. Earlier this week, it was reported that Bohemian Rhapsody producer Graham King had acquired the rights to make a film about Jackson, which is said to span his life from child star to death.</p>
      <p>For the Love of a Glove opens on 25 January at the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan theatre in Los Angeles.</p>
