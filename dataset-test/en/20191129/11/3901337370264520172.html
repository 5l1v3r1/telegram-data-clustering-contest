      <h1>Flashback – Masango's World-Class Panenka Against Pirates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:59:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">SL Social</a></address>
      <p>In his prime, Mandla Masango was considered one of the best players in the PSL while plying his trade with Kaizer Chiefs. His confidence was perhaps best illustrated when he pulled off a Panenka penalty in a Carling Black Label Cup match a few years ago. Check it out!</p>
      <p>Now 30, Masango finds himself clubless after leaving Danish outfit Randers FC in 2018. Before departing for Europe, however, he was a vital cog in Stuart Baxter's Amakhosi outfit in 2015 and came good as a crowd favourite in the process.</p>

      <p>With an endless array of tricks up his sleeve, Masango was as silky as they came on a football pitch and entertained fans alongside the likes of George Lebese and George Maluleka.</p>
      <p>In a Carling Black Label Cup match a few years back, he showed why fans loved him dearly after mustering up the confidence to pull off a cheeky Panenka penalty against Orlando Pirates.</p>
