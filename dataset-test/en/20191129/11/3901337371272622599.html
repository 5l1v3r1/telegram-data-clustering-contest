      <p>Following their respective European and domestic successes, Liverpool manager Klopp and Manchester City boss Guardiola were honoured by the League Managers Association on Thursday, when they were inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>Guardiola, who has led City to back-to-back Premier League titles and boasts three more domestic trophies to his name, revealed his pride at being inducted into the exclusive club, and gave credit to his team for the achievement.</p>
      <p>"What a privilege. When you come down the corridor and see all the big names, big managers, big personalities being here that would've helped to make football better, football that we have right now," Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>"I think all the managers here that have been inducted into the Hall of Fame is because we were in incredible clubs with incredible players.</p>
      <p>"As long as we can help them and try to think on the same side and the same page, that's the only reason we can do what we do as managers.</p>
      <p>"Without the quality of the players we have, the managers cannot have success."</p>

      <p>Klopp, who led Liverpool to a sixth UEFA Champions League crown last season, shared similar sentiments.</p>
      <p>"It's big, it's really big. When I first heard about it (the honour), I couldn't believe it," he said.</p>
      <p>"I've now been in England for a bit longer than four years and I've enjoyed each second, to be honest.</p>
      <p>"I saw all the names with the pictures when I came in, it's really impressive. I don't often feel pride but, in this moment, I'm very proud because this is something really, really special."</p>
