        <b>November’s four bruising defeats pile extra pressure on Preston Grasshoppers’ next two games – against their closest rivals in the battle to claw their way out of the relegation zone.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That is where they now find themselves for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s opponents Luctonians are third from bottom of National League Two North, two points ahead of Hoppers, while next Saturday’s visitors Hull, are a further two points above them.</p>
      <p>Luctonians have, in fact, won one fewer game than Hoppers – two victories, a draw and nine defeats, compared to the visitors’ three wins, a draw and eight defeats.</p>
      <p>But the Herefordshire club have collected an impressive 10 bonus points to Hoppers’ four.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, Luctonians have lost all five home games, but gave high-flying Fylde a shock in the most recent, losing by only 25-27.</p>
      <p>Their successes have come at Tynedale and Scunthorpe.</p>
      <p>Hoppers have lost their last four games and also their last four away fixtures.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, head coach Paul Arnold rings the changes, with Jordan Dorrington switching to full-back and a threequarter line of Scott Jordan, Alex Hurst, Sam Stott and Tyler Spence. Sam Wallbank is at lock with Toby Harrison in the back row.</p>
      <p>Fylde slipped to second place last weekend, following their second defeat to go with nine victories and one draw.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, they travel to Otley, who are 10th and have lost their last two games – both away from home.</p>
      <p>Fylde did the double over them last season, 24-14 at home and 14-3 away.</p>
      <p>In North One West, Vale of Lune travel to Broughton Park for a rearranged fixture following last month’s weather washout.</p>
      <p>Vale will be without Michael Forrest, who has an ankle injury, and the unavailable Henry Higginson.</p>
      <p>Callum Kyle and Andy Powers form a new centre partnership, flanker Blake Snell makes his first start, James Hesketh props and Scott Manning is at full-back after a four-week lay-off.</p>
      <p>Hoppers: J Dorrington; Jordan, Hurst, Stott, Spence; B Dorington, Gough; Miller, Taylor, Blanchard, Murray, Wallbank, Carlson, Harrison, Lamprey. Replacements: Mabaya, Millea, Procter, Squirrell, Gregson.</p>
      <p>Vale: Manning; Fern, Kyle, Powers, Eastwood; Briggs, Swarbrick; Heaketh, Dokter, Pillow, Cvijanovic, Fellows, Snell, Ayrton, Robinson. Replacements: Yates, Tagg, tba.</p>
