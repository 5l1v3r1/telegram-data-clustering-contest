      <p>Police have launched a murder investigation following a postmortem examination of a baby boy who died in Keady earlier ths week.</p>
      <p>A 31-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday November 26 after the death of 11-month-old Hunter McGleenon. Police have twice been granted more time to question him.</p>
      <p>PSNI Detective Chief Inspector Eamonn Corrigan confirmed that the death was being treated as murder.</p>
      <p>He appealed for information on a white BMW car.</p>
      <p>“As part of my investigation, I am interested in the movements of a white BMW 5 Series, registration 11D14035, around the Keady area during the early hours of Tuesday 26 November.</p>
      <p>"Were you in the area and do you believe you saw this vehicle, or did you capture it on your dash cam?"</p>
      <p>DCI Corrigan said his thoughts were with Hunter’s family and loved ones "who are coming to terms with their devastating loss".</p>
      <p>"This is something no parent should ever have to experience. His family should be looking forward to Hunter’s second Christmas.”  </p>
      <p>He added: "I would appeal to anyone who has any information to contact detectives on 101 quoting reference 587 of the 26/11/19. Alternatively information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."</p>
