      <p>On Friday morning, <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> finally put their fans out of their misery and fired head coach <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery">Unai Emery</a>. It is a decision that has been a long time coming, but after a listless 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League in front of an empty Emirates Stadium on Thursday night, there was no more patience left for the seemingly helpless Emery.</p>

      <h3>5. Regression from Arsene Wenger</h3>
      <p>At the end of the 2018 season, Arsenal had confirmed their place in the Europa League for the second successive season, slipped to sixth in the Premier League, and found themselves miles behind the other elite teams in England, especially Manchester City and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Arsene Wenger’s final 50 games were the worst period of his tenure in north London. And yet, in Unai Emery’s first 50 games as Arsenal head coach, the Gunners were worse in almost every category imaginable. Here is just a smattering of the statistics that they regressed in under Emery:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wins (27 vs 25)</li>
        <li>Points (88 vs 87)</li>
        <li>Goals (96 vs 89)</li>
        <li>Goals conceded (64 vs 68)</li>
        <li>Clean sheets (18 vs 10)</li>
        <li>Attempts (764 vs 617)]</li>
        <li>Shots on target (299 vs 223)</li>
        <li>Chances created (582 vs 479)</li>
        <li>Shots faced (576 vs 696)</li>
        <li>Shots on target faced (210 vs 252)</li>
        <li>Possession (61.4% vs 57.6%)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Arsenal were worse under Emery than they were during Wenger’s worst period. That tells you everything you need to know.</p>
