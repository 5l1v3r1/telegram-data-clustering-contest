      <p>Snapping its two-day record-setting streak, market benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled 336 points on Friday as investors turned jittery ahead of GDP data release.</p>
      <p>After plummeting 466 points during the session, the 30-share Sensex pared some losses, ending 336.36 points or 0.82% lower at 40,793.81.</p>
      <p>The broader NSE Nifty also settled 95.10 points or 0.78% down at 12,056.05.</p>
      <p>Yes Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding 2.50%, followed by HUL that fell 2.37%, M&amp;M 2.12%, SBI 2.03%, Tata Motors 2.03% and Vedanta 1.97%.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, HDFC Bank and NTPC ended with gains.</p>
      <p>Investors turned cautious ahead of Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) growth numbers, scheduled to be released later in the day, traders said.</p>
      <p>Experts are of the view that GDP growth for Q2 is expected to be lower than the 5% in Q1.</p>
      <p>Weak cues from global markets also weighed on market mood, they added.</p>
      <p>Bourses in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Kospi and Seoul ended in the red as US law supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong put a dampener on hopes of an early trade truce over tariffs.</p>
      <p>Stocks in Europe were trading on a positive note.</p>
      <p>On the currency front, the rupee depreciated 17 paise (intra-day) against the US dollar to 71.79.</p>
      <p>Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.79% to USD 62.77 per barrel in futures trade.</p>
