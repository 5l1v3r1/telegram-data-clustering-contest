      <h1>Razer's Deathadder Elite gaming mouse is only £35, its lowest price, this Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:47:38+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/author/pc-gamer/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a></address>
      <p>If you're rooting around the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-pc-gaming-deals/">Black Friday PC gaming deals</a> for a great mouse today, you can now put your feet up and relax—the Razer Deathadder Elite will sort you out. It's on sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-Deathadder-Elite-Mechanical-Switches/dp/B01MECR863/?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;ascsubtag=pcg-1051941279300596707-21">£34.99 on Amazon</a>, the lowest price we've seen. You're saving £35 compared to the list price, though it's been hovering around £50 for most of 2019.</p>
      <p>The Deathadder Elite got a spot in our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/the-best-gaming-mouse/">best gaming mouse in 2019</a> list, and while it's a particularly great mouse if you play a lot of shooters, there's no reason not to get it regardless of what games you play. </p>
      <p>The 16,000 CPI optical sensor has 99.4 percent resolution accuracy and a 450 IPS rating, making it one of the best and most precise sensors around, no matter how fast you're sliding the thing across your desk. </p>
      <p>It's comfy and light, too. Razer's kept the design largely the same over the years, so if you're put off by all those Deus Ex-looking things, you don't need to worry about the Deathadder Elite. It's got a simple, understated design that's practical rather than flashy. But it does light up. You've gotta have lights. </p>
