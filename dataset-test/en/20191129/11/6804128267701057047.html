      <h1>'Typical' - Norwich fans react to Unai Emery's Arsenal departure ahead of Premier League clash</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal boss has been shown the door at the Emirates Stadium following the 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T11:35:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Amie Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have sacked Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes less than 12 hours after the Gunners fell to defeat in the Europa League, losing a goal lead against Eintracht Frankfurt, losing the game 2-1.</p>
      <p>That defeat was the last straw for Arsenal, who announced the Spaniard's departure on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>"The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required," the statement on the official website read.</p>
      <p>"We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach. We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward.</p>
      <p>"The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete."</p>
      <p>Arsenal face Norwich City in their next Premier League game, as they travel to Carrow Road on Sunday. The Canaries will be looking to pick up a valuable three points in their fight against relegation this season, and may have targeted an Arsenal side that were winless in seven matches under Emery - a 27-year-old record.</p>
      <p>However, the news of the Spaniard's departure has caused fear among Norwich fans, who are worried about 'new manager bounce' under caretaker boss Freddie Ljungberg.</p>
      <p>Canaries' fans took to social media to give their thoughts once the news broke.</p>
