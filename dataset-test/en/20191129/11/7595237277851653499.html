      <p>Drone technology is increasingly popular, and many people may be looking forward to getting a drone this Christmas. But many are also unaware of the rules governing drones.</p>
      <p>The Irish Aviation Authority says the number of drones registered in Ireland has trebled to almost 14,000 since mandatory drone registration was introduced in December 2015.</p>
      <p>All drones weighing 1kg or more must be registered with the IAA via www.iaa.ie/drones.</p>

      <p>Drones below 1kg can be flown without a permit, provided they remain no more than 15m above ground level and no more than 300m from the operator.</p>
      <p>"Worldwide we've seen an upsurge in the use of drones and this is set to continue," said Peter Kearney, CEO Irish Aviation Authority.</p>
      <p>"But drones are not like any other toy. They can have very serious consequences if they collide with a person, an animal, an aircraft or many other objects.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, if you do get a drone this Christmas, you need to know the rules so that you can fly it safely."</p>
      <p>The IAA has now compiled a list of its top tips for drone operators in advance of the festive season, based on the current drone regulations.</p>
