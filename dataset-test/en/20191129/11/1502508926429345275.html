      <p>The government has initiated dialogue with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/asean">ASEAN </a>members for review of the free-trade agreement (FTA) executed 10 years ago, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal informed the Rajya Sabha on Friday.</p>
      <p>Replying to supplementaries during Question Hour, the minister said the FTA with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/asean">ASEAN </a>was executed around 10 years ago and "our study shows that we have not been able to get as much benefit out of the FTA".</p>
      <p>"We have opened up our market to many other countries to the detriment of India's and Indian coffee growers interests.</p>
      <p>"We have already initiated dialogue with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/asean">ASEAN </a>countries and I am happy to share with the House that ASEAN has agreed for a review of the FTA. We will take up various issues in the review and then we will report to the House," he told the House.</p>
      <p>He also said the Coffee Board is trying to develop an Indian brand of coffee for export and the work in this regard is underway.</p>
      <p>In his written reply, the minister also said the Government of India through the Coffee Board is undertaking various measures to boost the export of coffee across the world.</p>
