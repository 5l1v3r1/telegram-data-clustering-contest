      <p>If you've been shopping around for a decent VPN, you may be in luck.</p>
      <p>Named as one of the <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/06/five-best-vpn-service-providers-for-2019/">top VPNs of 2019</a>, PureVPN is usually quite pricey, but it currently available for only $1.32 a month.</p>
      <p>PureVPN comes with its own desktop client and is supported by both Chrome and Firefox. It also claims to work with American Netflix, which is extremely difficult to find with VPNs these days.</p>
      <p>Considering that <i>Into The Spider-Verse</i> just landed on there, it could be extremely worth it.</p>
      <p>The 5-year plan is usually $10.95 a month, which works out to be $131.40 a year. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=1kLXa2eqFiQ&amp;offerid=724633.340&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0">It's currently 88% off</a> which brings it down to <b>$1.32</b> a month, or $15.84 for a year.</p>
      <p>While you do need to sign up for 5 years there is a 31-day money back guarantee in case you change your mind.</p>
      <p>If you'd rather commit to less time, you can also get <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=1kLXa2eqFiQ&amp;offerid=724633.340&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0">47% off the one year plan</a> right now for $5.81 a month.</p>
      <p>You can find out more and <b><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5iIgM3JW7X0&amp;offerid=684663.5&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0">get the deal right here</a></b>.</p>
