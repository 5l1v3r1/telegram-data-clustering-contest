      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here star Vanessa White reportedly begged TV bosses for food after she lost the feeling in her legs from being so hungry.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Amazon’s Home of Black Friday launch event, the former Saturday’s singer revealed that she mainly struggled with hunger during her time in the jungle.</p>
      <p>‘When I was on the show I lost the feeling in my legs because I was just so hungry,’ she began.</p>
      <p>‘I begged the producers for food so they ended up giving me a Jelly Bean.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/05/vanessa-white-becomes-fourth-campmate-voted-off-im-celebrity-7135642/">Vanessa appeared on the show in 2017</a>, and was the fourth celeb to be evicted from the jungle.</p>
      <p>The former pop star’s most famous moment was during a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/03/watch-im-a-celebs-vanessa-white-painfully-struggle-to-guess-a-spice-girls-tune-in-karaoke-bushtucker-trial-7128194/">Bushtucker trial with Corrie star Jenny McAlpine.</a></p>

      <p>The duo took part in the task titled Car Cruel Karaoke, where they had to hold live critters in their mouths while humming a song that the other camper had to guess.</p>

      <p>Although shockingly, Vanessa wasn’t very good at it as she failed to guess a song by the Spice Girls.</p>
      <p>The show also came under fire from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebrity-use-live-bugs-bushtucker-trial-stars-hold-spiders-mouths-despite-controversial-ban-11206966/">viewers after they branded the trial cruel.</a></p>
      <p>On this year’s I’m A Celeb the topic of conversation among the campmates has been centred around food – or the lack of it.</p>
      <p>To be fair they haven’t faired too badly with the trials and they seem to be keeping their bellies relatively full.</p>
