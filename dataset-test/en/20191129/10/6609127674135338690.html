      <p>An adult version of the new design is Â£75 while a kids top will cost Â£50.</p>
      <p>10 per cent of proceeds will be donated to charity - so that's Â£7.50 per adult shirt and Â£5 per kids.</p>
      <p>This season's home shirt for an adult is Â£60 with a junior jersey available at Â£45.</p>
      <p>Supporters are loving the new design as they rushed to the online store to buy it.</p>
      <p>One fan said: "Got mine a few minutes ago. Love it, absolutely love it."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5009304/rangers-ibrox-closure-fans-sectarian-chants-feyenoord/">Rangers face having Ibrox closed for their Europa League match with Young Boys</a> if Uefa take action following reports of sectarian singing against Feyenoord.</p>
      <p>Gers have already been ordered by Uefa to close sections of the stadium on two occasions this season - for the visits of Legia Warsaw and the Dutch side.</p>
      <p>RangersÂ also declined to take any away tickets for the trip to face Young Boys at the start of October.</p>
      <p>Now, under Uefa's strict Article 14 rules on racism and other discriminatory conduct, they could be ordered to close the entire stadium for the final group game against Young Boys on December 12.</p>

      <p>A win in their last game against Young Boys guarantees they win Group G while a draw will ensure European football beyond Christmas.</p>
