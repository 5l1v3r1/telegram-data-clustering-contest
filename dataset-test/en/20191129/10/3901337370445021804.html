      <h1>Terrible Record Beckons For Pirates?  </h1>

      <p>Orlando Pirates are currently in search of a defender to strenthen their squad, with the technical team aware of the club’s not so impressive defensive abilities this season. </p>
      <p>Having decided against signing former Maritzburg United defender Brian Onyango, who trained with the team earlier in the season, the Buccaneers recently offered Ivorian central defender Kouassi Kouadja a trial with the team.</p>

      <p>Under former coach Milutin Sredojevic and Rulani Mokwena, following their arrival for the start of the 2017/18 season, there has been notable improvement in Pirates’ defence. </p>
      <p>Bucs conceded 26 goals and in 2nd place on the log at the end of the 2017/18 season, while the side further improved on their goals conceded last season with 24 goals and again finishing the league as runners-up. </p>

      <p>Against Polokwane City on Tuesday, the Soweto giants conceded two goals in their 3-2 win to take their goals conceded tally to 18 in 12 matches – six goals to reaching last season’s goal count.</p>
      <p>Pirates have had four clean sheets so far this season. Prior to the arrival of Sredojevic and Mokwena, Pirates had one of their worst defensive records in the league during the 2016/17 season after conceding 40 goals as they finished outside the top eight (11th) for the first time in the PSL era.</p>
      <p>The club’s record for the highest number of goals conceded in a season stands at 60 in 1986.   </p>
