      <p>Back by popular demand, this is the seventh time the Donna Louise Hospice has held the Christmas Fayre, but this is the first time it will be held at Yarnfield Park in Stone.</p>
      <p>Team members from Stafford Rangers have been helping to support the event and the committee's work.</p>
      <p>Chris Belyavin, fundraiser, said: "The friends group of the Hospice and Stafford Rangers have given us lots of support, including giving us access to their club, they have all been working hard to raise money ahead of the Fayre.</p>
      <p>"We will be serving refreshments throughout the day and the bar will be open, as well as the stalls from local businesses and crafters who have paid to have a stall, all of the money raised throughout the day will go to supporting the work of the Hospice.</p>
      <p>"There should be a nice Christmas atmosphere and we're even hoping to have a choir perform throughout the day, we hope that people in Stafford will come out to support us."</p>
      <p>The Fayre will see 31 stalls selling a number of items that will make perfect presents, from hand-made Christmas decorations and crafts, to jewellery, scented candles and bath products.</p>
      <p>There will also be 'Santa's Christmas Bus', courtesy of First Buses for youngsters, as well as tombolas, games, craft activities and face painting.</p>
      <p>Children will also be able to meet Santa and his helpers in the Christmas grotto and even some real life reindeer.</p>
      <p>Zoe Gregory, event organiser, said: "We're really excited to see the return of our much-loved Donna Louise Christmas Fayre. Previous years have seen incredible turn outs, and we hope to welcome many visitors once again.</p>
      <p>"With some fantastic stalls, as well the opportunity for children to meet Santa's reindeer, there really is something for all the family."</p>
      <p>The Donna Louise children and young people's hospice is based in Staffordshire.</p>
      <p>They support a number of children with life-limiting conditions and their families.</p>
      <p>The Christmas Fayre will be open from 11am to 3pm on November 30 in the Jon Downing Suite and Stan Robinson Suite and entry is Â£1 per person.</p>
