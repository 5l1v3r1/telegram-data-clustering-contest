      <p>2018 saw Black Widow actor Scarlett Johansson drop out of a movie following a critical online backlash over her casting in the fact-based drama <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/rub-and-tug/"><i>Rub and Tug</i></a>. The film told the story of <a href="https://screenrant.com/rub-tug-movie-dante-gill-scarlett-johansson/">Dante "Tex" Gill</a>, a transgender man who ran a massage parlor in Pittsburgh during the 1970s and '80s that turned out to be a front for a prostitution ring. Before his death in 2003, Gill lived his life as a man and preferred masculine pronouns, and Johansson was primed to play the transgender character. However, while the actor was initially somewhat defiant over the reception, her opinion has since changed.</p>
      <p>"In hindsight, I mishandled that situation," Johansson told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/scarlett-johansson-oscars-issue-cover-story"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>. "I was not sensitive, my initial reaction to it. I wasn't totally aware of how the trans community felt about those three actors playing—and how they felt in general about cis actors playing—transgender people. I wasn't aware of that conversation—I was uneducated. So I learned a lot through that process. I misjudged that…. It was a hard time. It was like a whirlwind. I felt terribly about it. To feel like you're kind of tone-deaf to something is not a good feeling."</p>

      <p>When originally faced with the backlash, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/scarlett-johansson-transgender-role-controversy/">Johansson issued a statement</a> highlighting what she thought of as hypocritical, selective criticism. She pointed to Amazon Prime's <i>Transparent</i> in relation to her casting, saying, "Tell them that [people with critcicisms] can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman's reps for comment." She would later <a href="https://www.cbr.com/scarlett-johansson-exits-rub-tug-trans-backlash/">pull out of the movie</a>, issuing another statement that acknowledged the insensitivity of her initial comments and support for the trans community.</p>
      <p>Johansson is set to star in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-widow-movie/"><i>Black Widow</i></a>, a prequel movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will take place following the events of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. Directed by Cate Shortland, <i>Black Widow</i> stars Scarlett Johansson, David Harbour, Florence Pugh, O-T Fagbenle and Rachel Weisz. The film arrives in theaters on May 1, 2020.</p>
