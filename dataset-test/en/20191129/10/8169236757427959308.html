        <b>Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard said that scoring his first goal of the season will give him more confidence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The England international led a young Red Devils side in yesterday’s Europa League match against Astana and opened the scoring after just ten minutes. However, the Kazakhstan club came back and won 2-1 thanks to a goal from Dmitri Shomko and an own goal from Di’Shon Bernard.</p>

      <p>Lingard netted his first of the season and said that he was happy to have opened his goal account in 2019/20. Speaking to Manchester United’s <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/lingard-delighted-to-open-his-scoring-account-for-the-season">official website</a>, the 27-year-old said: “It’s always good to get off the mark and it gives you a bit of confidence. We started off quick and we dominated the first half, but it’s that 30-second period in the second half where I thought we could have managed the game a bit better.”</p>
      <p>The defeat won’t make much of a difference for Manchester United as they have qualified for the knockout stages of the Europa League. After scoring yesterday, Lingard will hope to put on a good performance this weekend when the Red Devils take on Aston Villa at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>A win for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s could see them go up in the Premier League table.</p>
