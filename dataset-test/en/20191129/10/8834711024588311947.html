      <h1>Mayor Election Delay Won’t Affect JHB Service Delivery</h1>

      <p>JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) has on Thursday dismissed the African National Congress’ (ANC) accusations that service delivery would collapse in Johannesburg, as the city awaits the election of a new mayor next week.</p>
      <p>Speaker Vasco da Gama postponed the election, saying he would seek legal advice on the actual number of votes that make a majority.</p>
      <p>The ANC has accused the DA of putting services at risk in an attempt to cling to power and Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile said he would close that vacuum.</p>
      <p>Political parties are exchanging accusations as the scramble for the most sought-after municipality in the country ensues.</p>
      <p>Maile said Da Gama had no business postponing the election of the mayor because he had created a vacuum.</p>
      <p>“So, we cannot conveniently argue that position is not important now, because if that’s the argument of the DA, it’s just to suit their political posture.”</p>
      <p>Maile said his legal team was looking at interventions to ensure that service delivery was not interrupted.</p>
      <p>But DA provincial chair Mike Moriarty said there was no such thing, instead, the ANC was afraid.</p>
      <p>“Once it became clear that Makhubo was the candidate, that was a huge problem and not just the problem for the EFF, it was a problem with the ANC.”</p>
      <p>Maile said he won’t keep quiet simply because he would be accused of towing the party line.</p>
      <p>The DA denied it was buying time but admitted it would use this window to woo the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).</p>
      <p>But the EFF said it was still backing its own candidate come Wednesday.</p>
