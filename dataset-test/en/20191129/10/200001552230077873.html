      <p>As the German character assassination of Jadon Sancho continues, it’s not too hard to believe there’s more going on in the background than is known about.</p>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund made it very clear they wouldn’t be selling the England international last summer, with the big insinuation being they wouldn’t mind cashing in during the 2020 summer market.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have been the club most linked with Sancho, with the claims going back around a year. Friday’s edition of <a href="http://bild.de/">Bild</a> reports they’re the ‘hottest candidates’ along with Liverpool and Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>It’s fair to say there’s been no huge reporting in Spain of Madrid interest.</p>
      <p>Bild go over Sancho being late for a team meeting, and say it isn’t the only time he’s been unprofessional recently. Despite the 19 year old having five goals and eight assists so far this season, he’s been receiving a lot of criticism, which could all be part of the BVB process of getting ready for a transfer.</p>

      <p>The German newspaper states that if Sancho continues to show bad behaviour then a winter transfer is increasingly possible.</p>
      <p>There’s no talk of contact from Manchester United at this stage, but if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side are as keen as had been insisted, they’ll be watching this situation very carefully.</p>
