      <p>BRUSSELS — Official figures show that inflation across the 19-country eurozone rose in November but remains way below the level that the European Central Bank and its new president, Christine Lagarde, would like it to be.</p>
      <p>Statistics agency Eurostat said Friday that consumer prices were up 1% in the year to November. That’s up from the previous month’s rate of 0.7% and ahead of market expectations for a more modest increase to 0.9%.</p>
      <p>Eurostat said that was due to higher food, alcohol and tobacco costs.</p>
      <p>Stripping out those items, as well as energy costs, the so-called core inflation rate also increased, to 1.3% from 1.1%. That suggests underlying inflation partly related to wage increases may be firming.</p>
      <p>Still, inflation, by whatever measure, is below the ECB’s aim of near 2%.</p>
