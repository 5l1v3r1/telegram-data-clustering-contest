      <h1>Report: Arsenal considering Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti after Unai Emery sacked</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:45:23+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/29/carlo-ancelotti-among-arsenal-candidates-replace-unai-emery/">The Telegraph have claimed</a> that Arsenal are considering a move for Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti after the Gunners confirmed they had sacked Unai Emery, following Thursday night’s 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have now gone seven league and cup outings without a win, piling the pressure on Emery. Gunners fans wanted the Spaniard gone a lot sooner, and it now appears that the board have agreed the ex-PSG boss needed to go.</p>
      <p>Emery cut an angry figure on the sidelines as Arsenal’s 1-0 lead was turned on its head by Frankfurt. However, the Spaniard was running out of ideas – bringing Lucas Torreira on as a sub with Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe on the bench.</p>
      <p>Now, the Gunners are said to be after former Chelsea boss Ancelotti. It is believed Ancelotti could want anywhere between £230,000 a week and £290,000 a week, while Freddie Ljungberg will take charge of this weekend’s game against Norwich.</p>
      <p>The report also claims that other alternatives to replace Emery include Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo and Manchester City assistant Mikel Arteta. Ancelotti has a contract at Napoli until the summer of 2021.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Could Ancelotti turn things around?</h3>
      <p>The Napoli manager showed this week that he is more than capable of getting the best out of a side that might not have the quality. Napoli produced a stunning display at Anfield, and arguably should have beaten Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Things have become toxic at Arsenal. A lack of morale, understanding or identity has left the players befuddled when they walk out onto the pitch – though they certainly have the quality. Ancelotti is experienced enough to get them going.</p>
