      <p><b>Share Market News Today | Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices LIVE: </b>The headline indices Sensex and Nifty receded from record high levels on Friday, tracking weak GDP data outlook. The Sensex ended 336 points down at 40,793, while the Nifty closed near the 12,050-mark. <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/yes-bank-ltd-stock-price/">Yes Bank</a>, <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/hindustan-unilever-ltd-stock-price/">HUL</a>, M&amp;M were among the biggest losers, shedding up to 3%. India’s economy probably expanded at its weakest pace in more than six years in the quarter to September, a Reuters poll showed, as consumer demand and private investment weakened further and a global slowdown hit exports. The median of a poll of economists showed annual growth in gross domestic product of 4.7% in the quarter, down from 5.0% in the previous three months and 7% for the corresponding period of 2018, Reuters reported. India’s largest bank <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/state-bank-of-india-stock-price/">SBI</a> has revised down the second-quarter growth to a mere 4.2 per cent on account of low automobile sales, deceleration in air traffic movement, slow core sector growth and declining investment in construction and infrastructure. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/tag/mukesh-ambani/">Mukesh Ambani</a>’s <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/reliance-industries-ltd-stock-price/">Reliance Industries</a> finally crossed the m-cap of Rs 10 lakh crore and has become the first company to pull off this feat. In just five years, the company has added Rs 7 lakh crore to its market cap. The company is now the most valued firm in terms of m-cap. <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/reliance-industries-ltd-stock-price/">RIL</a>’s stock was trading at Rs 1,578 on Friday morning.
