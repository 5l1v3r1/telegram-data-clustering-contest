      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - Workers at Amazon distribution centers in Germany have gone on strike for better pay on Black Friday, one of the busiest days of the year for the online retailer.</p>
      <p>Union ver.di said Friday that the walkouts began overnight at six distribution centers across the country, with some due to last until Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Union representative Orhan Akman said Amazon staff want to send a signal that their work can't be bought with the kind of extreme discounts Amazon offers around this time of the year.</p>
      <p>Akman also accused the company of putting "extreme pressure" on staff that's causing some to fall ill.</p>
      <p>Amazon said in an emailed statement that "packages are arriving punctually, because the bulk of employees is dealing completely normally with customers' orders today."</p>
      <p>It said that it offers pay "at the upper end of comparable jobs" and other benefits.</p>
