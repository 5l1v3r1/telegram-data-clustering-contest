        <b>Warner Bros. might finally be ready to reveal their next Batman Arkham game next month, according to the latest rumours.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s been nearly five years since the last major Batman game came out and ever since we have been drowning in rumours regarding Warner’s next entry in the Arkham franchise.</p>
      <p>But it looks like those rumours and leaks are about to come to an end, as the latest one is claiming that a new game, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/22/batman-arkham-legacy-name-new-batman-game-claim-sources-10961317/">apparently called Arkham Legacy</a>, will be officially revealed next month.</p>
      <p>This report comes from YouTube channel Sclmof, which claims to have heard from a source that the game will be announced at this year’s Game Awards, which is scheduled for 13 December.</p>
      <p>Apparently, this information comes from the same source that leaked the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/12/19/suicide-squad-game-cancelled-new-batman-game-underway-claims-insiders-6333369/">cancelled Damian Wayne game</a>, so there’s a good chance it’s reliable.</p>

      <p>Previous rumours have been somewhat consistent, claiming that this new game will be inspired by the Court of Owls storyline from the comics, which saw Batman face a shadowy organisation that had been secretly controlling Gotham City for centuries.</p>
      <p>That also matches up with a mysterious series of tweets from Warner Bros. Games Montreal, which had a very short video that just showed off various symbols, one of which at least seemed to be connected to the Court of Owls.</p>
      <p>It’s also been suggested that players will be able to take control of the ‘Bat family,’ implying multiple playable characters, which would make sense given the title and how Arkham Knight ended. Although there’s never been any evidence for that.</p>
      <p>The only bit of concrete info we do have is that Kevin Conroy, who has voiced Batman in multiple media, including the Arkham games, won’t be reprising the role.</p>
      <p>What has also been clear is that Rocksteady, who created the series, are not the main developer, but instead Arkham Origins developer Warner Bros. Games Montreal are making the game.</p>
      <p>What Rocksteady has been doing all generation remains a mystery and, unlike Arkham Legacy, there’s no hint of an imminent reveal. Although most rumours point towards them working on some kind of online title, perhaps the DC universe – or at least Batman universe – equivalent of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/marvels-avengers-hands-preview-assembling-ultimate-superhero-game-10604541/">Square Enix’s Avengers game</a>.</p>
