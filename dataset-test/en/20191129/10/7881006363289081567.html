      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: BJP MP Pragya Thakur Singh in Lok Sabha on Friday apologised for second time for her comment calling Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse a patriot.</p>
      <p>Tendering an unconditional apology for the second time, Pragya said: “On November 27, during discussion on Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill, 2019, I did not call Nathuram Godse a 'deshbhakt'. I did not even mention his name. I apologise again if I have hurt any sentiments.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Earlier, Pragya apologised and said: “If anyone was hurt due to any of my statements, I apologise. But my point was misrepresented and misquoted." She also said that she respects Mahatma Gandhi's contribution to the nation.</p>
      <p>Referring to Rahul Gandhi’s remark, she said a member of the House referred to her as 'terrorist' and called it as an attack on her dignity. “No charges against me have been proven in court,” she added.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Thakur created a controversy with her remark in the Lower House of Parliament during DMK member A Raja's narration of a statement by Nathuram Godse before a court on why he killed Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
      <p>However, after the opposition members' protest, the Lok Sabha speaker said only the DMK leader's speech during the discussion on the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill would go on record.</p>
      <p>"We are very clear about it that we condemn her statement and we do not support this ideology," BJP working president J P Nadda said.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that Thakur has courted controversy because of her comments on Godse. During the Lok Sabha election campaign, Thakur had described Godse as a patriot, triggering a huge political storm. Later, she had apologised for her statement.</p>
