      <h1>Next Arsenal manager: Nuno Espirito Santo and the other contenders to replace Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery has been shown the door at the Emirates Stadium after a 2-1 defeat at home against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:27:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow, Lee Wilmot</a></address>
      <p>It is official, Unai Emery is no longer in charge of Arsenal.</p>
      <p>A 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League proved to be the last straw for Arsenal chiefs, with the club announcing the departure of Emery and his coaching staff on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>"We announce today that the decision has been taken to part company with our head coach Unai Emery and his coaching team," read a statement on the official website.</p>
      <p>"The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.</p>
      <p>"We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach. We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward.</p>
      <p>"The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete."</p>
      <p>A number of names have already been linked to the role, so who could be the next person in the hot seat at the Emirates Stadium?</p>
      <p>We take a look at the candidates to replace Emery here.</p>
      <h3>Nuno Espirito Santo</h3>
      <p>The Wolves manager has done an excellent job since arriving in England in 2017.</p>
      <p>He guided Wolves to the Premier League, winning the Championship and not only kept them in the top flight last season, but qualified for the Europa League courtesy of a fine seventh-placed finish.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Showing no signs of easing up, with Wolves fifth in the table this season.</p>
      <p>He is the current favourite to replace Emery.</p>
      <h3>Mikel Arteta</h3>
      <p>A former Arsenal favourite and would be a popular choice to take over.</p>
      <p>Was touted for the job last season, when Emery was eventually appointed but remained in place as Pep Guardiola's number two at Manchester City.</p>

      <p>Arteta is tipped to make the step up into management at some point and many fans would be pleased to see him given a chance in the Emirates hotseat having come so close last season.</p>
      <p>Second favourite for the job.</p>
      <h3>Massimiliano Allegri</h3>
      <p>Former Juventus boss has the pedigree and would seem to be a solid appointment.</p>
      <p>Has a wealth of experience and a winning mentality too.</p>

      <p>Lacks Premier League experience, of course, but has won Serie A six times and the Coppa Italia on four occasions. He also led Juventus to the Champions League final twice.</p>
      <p>Third favourite for the job currently.</p>
      <h3>Mauricio Pochettino</h3>
      <p>The controversial appointment.</p>
      <p>Pochettino spent five-and-a-half years at Tottenham, helping them finish above Arsenal for three consecutive seasons.</p>

      <p>He was sacked by Spurs last week following a poor start to the season though and has been tipped for bigger and better jobs.</p>
      <p>Has always stated he would not manage Arsenal, given his Tottenham ties, but that has not stopped plenty of speculation around him arriving at the Emirates.</p>

      <h3>Freddie Ljungberg</h3>
      <p>Another former Arsenal favourite who would be a popular choice among the supporters.</p>
      <p>He has taken over as caretaker manager at the club, having been promoted to first team duties this season.</p>

      <p>He has no experience as a manager though and would need time and patience as he learnt on the job.</p>
      <p>Has overseen the development of the young players at the Emirates and could do what Frank Lampard has done at Chelsea.</p>
