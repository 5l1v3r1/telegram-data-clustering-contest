      <p>An ambush by Islamic State jihadists did not cause a collision between two French army helicopters which left 13 soldiers dead in Mali, France’s military chief of staff said Friday.</p>
      <p>The Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) claimed responsibility for Monday’s accident, the heaviest single loss for the French army in nearly four decades.</p>
      <p>“It’s totally false,” General Francois Lecointre told Radio France International.</p>
      <p>“The truth is that there was a collision during a very complex combat operation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The French army is telling the truth: we owe it to our soldiers and to the families of our dead colleagues.”</p>
      <p>ISWAP said its fighters ambushed a French convoy near Indelimane village, in the Menaka area, and opened fire on one of the helicopters that arrived in support.</p>
      <p>“After staggering in flight, it then collided with another helicopter, killing 13 Crusaders,” said an ISWAP statement carried on the SITE intelligence group website.</p>
      <p>The general said there was no attack by the jihadists that the army was pursuing near the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>
      <p>“There was no withdrawal of an aircraft in the face of fire from the jihadists,” he added.</p>
      <p>The general said the helicopter black boxes were being analysed for details of exactly what happened.</p>
      <p>The accident brought to 41 the number of French troops killed in the Sahel region since Paris intervened against jihadists in northern Mali in 2013.</p>
      <p>Since then, armed groups affiliated with IS, Al-Qaeda and others have advanced into southern Mali as well as neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>
