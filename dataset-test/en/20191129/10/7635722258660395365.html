        <b>Carlo Ancelotti is believed to be one of the names Arsenal are considering as their new head coach after Unai Emery was fired.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/29/carlo-ancelotti-among-arsenal-candidates-replace-unai-emery/">The Telegraph</a> are reporting that the Italian is one of the contenders to replace the Spaniard, who was shown the door after a run of poor results, culminating in Arsenal's worst run of form since 1992.</p>
      <p>Swede Freddie Ljungberg, a popular member of the 'Invincibles' team back in the noughties, is to take charge of team affairs as interim head coach until further notice.</p>
      <p>The decision as to who will replace Emery permanently will be made by head of football Raul Sanllehi and technical director Edu, who will make a recommendation to the owners, the Kroenke family.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti won the European Cup as a player with AC Milan before managing the Rossoneri to Champions League titles in 2003 and 2007.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti has tasted success in London before, when he guided Chelsea to the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010.</p>
      <p>He then brought Real Madrid to the European summit in 2014.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti is currently in charge of Serie A side Napoli, who have struggled of late. His contract runs out at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Other names being linked with the position at the Emirates Stadium are ex-Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, Leicester's Brendan Rodgers, Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo and Bournemouth's Eddie Howe.</p>
