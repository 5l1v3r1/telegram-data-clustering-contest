      <h1>'Finally, thank you Arsenal!' - What Gunners fans are saying about Unai Emery exit</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal have sacked Unai Emery after a run of seven games without a win, bringing an end to his 18 months in charge of the Gunners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:37:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:37</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>It is the news many Arsenal fans have been waiting for, and Unai Emery has finally been sacked by the Gunners.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has been relieved of his duties this morning (Friday) after a poor run of form in recent weeks, with Arsenal seven games without a win in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The final straw proved to be the 2-1 defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League last night (Thursday), with Arsenal fans booing at the final whistle after another poor display.</p>
      <p>After the game, Emery said he was only focused on that game, and not thinking about his future amid increasing pressure and scrutiny over his position.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, Arsenal fans have been calling for a management change, and now they <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/breaking-unai-emery-sacked-arsenal-17334955">have got their wish</a> .</p>
