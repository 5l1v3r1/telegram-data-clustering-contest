      <p>An Alpine Village has arrived at the Trafford Centre with a huge teepee, festive huts and more.</p>
      <p>The village first appeared <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alpine-village-trafford-centre-open-15417372">last year</a> and was a big hit with families wanting to get in the Christmas spirit.</p>
      <p>This time organisers say it's even better as there's the addition of the Big Wheel, which arrived for Halloween but is staying until next year.</p>
