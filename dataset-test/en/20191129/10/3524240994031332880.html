      <p>A South African court on Friday dismissed former president Jacob Zuma’s attempts to appeal against his corruption trial related to a 1990s arms deal.</p>
      <p>The High Court in the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg ruled that “Mr Zuma’s leave to appeal is dismissed with costs”.</p>
      <p>He is alleged to have taken bribes worth four million rand ($270,000, 240,000 euros) related to a $3.4 billion arms deal in 1999 when he was deputy president.</p>
