      <p>FRANKFURT AM MAIN, Nov 29 — Hundreds of Amazon workers in Germany walked off the job as the US online retailer kicked off its “Black Friday” sales bonanza, escalating a long-simmering battle for better pay and working conditions.</p>
      <p>The strike called by the powerful Verdi union is set to last until Tuesday morning and will also cover “Cyber Monday”, another extravaganza of online discounts in what is a crucial sales period for Amazon.</p>
      <p>Verdi spokeswoman Eva Voelpel told AFP “several hundred” employees had started the stoppage at Amazon distribution centres in Leipzig, Bad Hersfeld, Koblenz, Rheinberg, Werne and Graben.</p>
      <p>“Their work cannot be had at rock-bottom prices,” Verdi said in a statement, demanding a collective labour agreement to ensure “a living wage and good, healthy jobs”.</p>
      <p>The union accused Amazon of “withholding basic rights” from staff and of making them work “under extreme pressure”.</p>
      <p>“As a result, many employees become ill,” Verdi said.</p>
      <p>Amazon played down the strike’s impact, saying “packages will arrive on time”.</p>
      <p>The company has long resisted the union’s call for labour negotiations, defending its work environment and insisting that is “one of the best employers in the logistics industry”.</p>
      <p>“We pay at the upper end of what is usual for comparable work, we offer additional benefits and review wages annually,” the company said.</p>
      <p>The majority of its 13,000 employees in 13 logistics centres across Germany will be working “as normal”, it added.</p>
      <p>Amazon has been hit by repeated strikes in Germany and other countries in recent years.</p>
      <p>Last year’s “Black Friday” event saw stoppages by workers in Spain, Germany and Britain. — AFP</p>
