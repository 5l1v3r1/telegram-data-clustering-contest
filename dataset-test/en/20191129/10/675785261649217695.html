      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:21:40+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have decided to sack Unai Emery as manager after just 18 months in charge.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Emery has led the Gunners through an awful run of form which culminated in Thursday night's 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are seven matches without a win - with their last victory in the Premier League coming on October 6 against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> .</p>
      <p>Emery was appointed in May 2018 after Arsene Wenger's reign ended after 22 years - with the Frenchman picking up the Premier League titles and seven FA Cups.</p>
      <p>Former Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla manager Emery guided the Gunners in fifth in the Premier League in his debut season and took his side to the Europa League final - where they were thrashed by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>

      <p>Arsenal have slumped to eighth in the league, Emery has been let go - with a record of 78 matches, 43 wins, 16 draws and 19 defeats.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg has been placed in interim charge as the club put the feelers out for a new boss.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal statement in full</h3>
      <p>We announce today that the decision has been taken to part company with our head coach Unai Emery and his coaching team.</p>

      <p>Speaking on behalf of the Arsenal board and our owners Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Josh Kroenke said: “Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand. We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success.” <br/><br/>The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.</p>
      <p>We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach. We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward. <br/><br/>The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete.</p>
