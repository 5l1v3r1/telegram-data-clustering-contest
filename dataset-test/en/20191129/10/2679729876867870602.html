      <h1>Green Climate Fund to channel over $1.87bn in tackling emissions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:02:58+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.esi-africa.com/author/babalwa-c/" target="_blank">Babalwa Bungane</a></address>

        <b>The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is now financing climate action initiatives in over 100 developing countries after the final Board meeting of 2019 approved 13 new projects.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Board has allocated $407.8 million, raising GCF’s total portfolio to $5.6 billion. This includes new transformative initiatives in China, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mozambique, Nepal, the Philippines and the State of Palestine.</p>
      <p>Combining co-financing by GCF’s funding partners, the newly approved projects will channel over $1.87 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance <a href="https://www.esi-africa.com/tag/climate-change/">climate resilience</a>.</p>
      <p>The Board also approved seven new Accredited Entities, which propose and implement climate projects funded by GCF, bringing the total to 95.</p>
      <p>Among these are five direct access entities, adding to the 51 that provide national and regional channels to access GCF funds.</p>
      <p>The Board adopted an updated gender policy and gender action plan and a policy on co-financing. It also reviewed GCF’s updated Strategic Plan for the 2020-2023 programming period, which aims to deliver more ambitious impact for developing countries.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The allocation of new funding during the Board meeting follows GCF’s first replenishment pledging conference in October.</p>
      <p>To date, 28 countries have pledged $9.78 billion equivalent to fund climate action over the next four years.</p>
      <p>Co-chair Nagmeldin Goutbi Elhassan Mahmoud said: “The influx of replenishment funds will help GCF to meet the growing demand for both adaptation and mitigation initiatives aimed at countering the climate challenge. By approving a range of new projects, this successful Board meeting – our last as co-chairs – helps to meet this need. Developing countries’ rising ambitions, however, shows that much more can be done.”</p>
      <h3>Green Climate Fund drives global climate action</h3>
      <p>Also commenting on the development, Co-chair Josceline Wheatley said: “The expansion of GCF’s portfolio to include more than 100 countries is a milestone, wrapping up the Fund’s first four years of operations. As I prepare to step down as Co-chair and reflect on GCF’s achievements in 2019, I am confident the Green Climate Fund will further consolidate its role as a central player driving global climate action.”</p>
      <p>GCF Executive Director Yannick Glemarec said: “This Board meeting has reinforced GCF’s momentum in progressing support for climate action. We have now allocated the bulk of the funds we received during our initial resource mobilisation.</p>
      <p>“With a strong replenishment, we are well equipped to enhance developing countries’ ability to meet their Paris Agreement goals.”</p>
      <p>During the GCF Board Meeting, the Republic of Indonesia pledged $500,000 to the Fund’s first replenishment – a doubling of its contribution from GCF’s initial resource mobilisation. Indonesia is both a contributor to, and a recipient of GCF funding.</p>
