      <p>As it turns out, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-widow/">Black Widow</a> actor Scarlett Johansson knew about her character's ultimate sacrifice before she was given the script for <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-infinity-war/">Avengers: Infinity War</a></i>, thanks to a phone call from Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige.</p>
      <p>"Kevin Feige called me, as was kind of normal, just to discuss whatever the script was and what was going on. But I think he called me to tell me that," Johansson told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/scarlett-johansson-oscars-issue-cover-story">Vanity Fair</a>. "I was surprised, but I also kind of wasn't surprised at the same time. I think we all knew there were going to be some big losses."</p>

      <p>Black Widow was one of the only Avengers who didn't survive the team's desperate mission to stop Thanos. She died during the events of <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame</a></i>, saving Hawkeye in the process.</p>
      <p>As a result,<i> Black Widow</i> will be a prequel set before <i>Endgame</i>. It will reportedly take place after <i>Captain America: Civil War</i> and will follow Natasha "Black Widow" Romanoff as she confronts her mysterious past.</p>
