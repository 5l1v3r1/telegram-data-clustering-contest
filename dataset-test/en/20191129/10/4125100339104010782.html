      <p>The NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said the feats were achieved when NAF jets and a helicopter gunship were scrambled to provide close air support to ground troops as they repelled the terrorists’ attack on the location.</p>

      <p>The statement read: “The aircraft, upon arrival overhead the target area, tracked and engaged three of the BHT gun trucks that were involved in the attack.</p>
      <p>“The BHTs moved the vehicles under some trees, while some of the fighters alighted the vehicles and attempted to escape into the surrounding bushes.</p>
      <p>“The attack aircraft engaged them, scoring accurate hits on two vehicles, which were seen engulfed in flames, and neutralising some of the fleeing terrorists.” (NAN)</p>
