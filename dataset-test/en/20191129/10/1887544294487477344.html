      <p>MONTREAL -- Ontario Premier Doug Ford will be meeting with his Quebec counterpart tonight, days before all provincial leaders get together in Toronto.</p>
      <p>Ford says he will discuss areas of agreement with Francois Legault when the two meet for dinner in Montreal.</p>
      <p>That means they won't discuss Bill 21 -- Quebec's secularism law that bans public employees from wearing religious symbols on the job.</p>
      <p>Ford's Progressive Conservative government supported an NDP motion in the legislature this week condemning the controversial law.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Ford says the premier plans to raise issues of national unity, health care, infrastructure and economic development.</p>
      <p>Ford joked that energy will likely come up as well, since Legault is always trying to sell some to Ontario.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 29, 2019.</p>
