      <p>French FTTP networks covered another 1.2 million homes and businesses in the three months to September, a new high after the record 1.1 million premises passed in the previous quarter. Overall, 16.7 million premises had access to FTTP services, up 34 percent year-on-year, said regulator Arcep in its latest <a href="https://www.arcep.fr/fileadmin/cru-1574699937/reprise/observatoire/HD-THD-2017/2019-t3/Observatoire_HD_THD_T3_2019.pdf">fixed broadband report</a>.  </p>
      <p>The quarterly growth included nearly 340,000 additional premises passed on public initiative fibre networks in less densely populated areas. Including cable and VDSL, 22.4 million French premises could receive high-speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps at end-September, up 14 percent year-on-year.</p>
      <p>Arcep noted that Orange and SFR need to accelerate their FTTP roll-out further if they are to meet the coverage commitments undertaken in the <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/french-regulator-welcomes-binding-commitments-from-orange-sfr-on-ftth-rollout--1250304">AMII agreement</a>, which mainly concerns mid-size towns where the two operators are investing without the help of public subsidies.</p>
      <p>FTTP subscriptions rose 47 percent year-on-year to 6.4 million, or 21.5 percent of the overall fixed broadband market. Quarterly net additions improved to 540,000, from 495,000 in the three months to June.</p>
      <p>Overall, fixed broadband connections increased by nearly 170,000 since June to reach 29.5 million at end-September. Out of this total, 10.6 million subscribers received speeds over 30 Mbps, across FTTP, cable, VDSL and LTE-based fixed offers. </p>
