      <h1>Pati Patni Aur Woh: Director Mudassar Aziz Takes A Dig At Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots; Cited Double Standards</h1>

        <b>Makers of Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Pandey starrer Pati Patni Aur Woh had to mute the word 'Balatkar' post the outrage a dialogue received on social media. Now, director Mudassar Aziz shared his thoughts on it</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the trailer of Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Pandey starrer Pati Patni Aur Woh hit the internet, netizens criticised the makers for talking about marital rape to create comedy. A lot of people bashed Kartik and makers for a monologue in the film that talks about sex and marital rape. Following this, the makers had to mute the word 'balatkar'. Now, director Mudassar Aziz shared his thoughts on the controversy and even took a dig at Aamir Khan's film 3 Idiots.</p>
      <p>In his interview with PTI, Aziz spoke about the double standards of people who had a problem with the word balatkar in his film while they were completely fine with the same term being used in Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots 36 times. He started off by saying, "It was very unfortunate that the word 'balatkar' has had to be replaced. It is unfortunate because I maintain my stand that a 12-year-old needs to know what rape is. The act is wrong, but if you are not going to talk about it and if they aren't going to know what the term stands for, you're going to be a generation that's unaware. Don't stop the word, stop the act".

      <p>Further adding, "By muting that word, you're not getting anything. What sort of double standard is it that in one film (3 Idiots) a person reads 'balatkar' 36 times from a letter and everyone was laughing."</p>

      <p>The dialogue in question from Pati Patni Aur Woh has Kartik Aaryan talking about sex to his friend played by Aparshakti Khurana. He goes on to say that if a husband somehow manages to get sex from his wife than it is termed as rape. Even Kartik shared his thoughts on the controversy and quoted to the news agency, "We took responsibility because it might have come across as something that wasn't our intention. We realised we shouldn't use that word (rape) at all so we have rectified it and made changes because we don't want to hurt people's sentiments."</p>
