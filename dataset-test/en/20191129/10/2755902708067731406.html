        <b>Mzansi Magosha’s offer Black Friday discounts, Business Booming</b>
      </p>
      <p>Basically the whole of Mzansi is on Black Friday mood today with crazy specials on various goods across the nation. A lot of people woke up at 4 am to try and grab great deals from shops. The shopping frenzy happens once every year and is usually done on the last Friday of November.</p>
      <p>This year’s <a href="https://iharare.com/black-friday-settings-in-zim/">Black Friday</a> has, however, come with a new special which has proved popular among other specials currently running. Ladies of the night {Magosha’s) have decided to join in and offer clients black Friday specials and theirs is running throughout the entire weekend. The Magosha’s said they had a meeting and decided to offer a black Friday special discount of only R20 per session. Meaning instead of the usual R70, clients will be paying R50. “Competition is tough, and we understand that R70 can be a lot of money, so for this weekend only we’re selling for R50,” said one of the ladies. We know everything is on special,” magoshas from Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal, not too far from Joburg, said.</p>
      <aside>“We had a meeting and agreed to do our own Black Friday so we could get more clients.”</aside>
      <p>The magoshas said they were hoping to attract more customers to cash in on the Black Friday craze and take home more money to their kids and families.</p>
      <p>The news seems to have spread like wildfire as the magosha’s reported that business was “Booming” on Friday. One lady said she sent messages to some of her regular clients who received the news with open arms and zippers.</p>
      <p>A 33-year-old man who, for obvious reasons, didn’t want to give his name, said he’d be taking his place in the Black Friday queue.</p>
      <p>“Imagine if you’re very happy when you pay full price. Definitely you’ll have to come back if the price is so much cheaper.”</p>
      <p>He said he’d be back today.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to get more bang for my buck,” he said.</p>
