      <p>Amazon UK currently has a few good deals on cheap external hard drives. Obviously you're going to want an SSD to keep your games installed on so you don't have to spend all day staring at the loading screens in Total War: Three Kingdoms, but if you need some extra space for backing up photos, videos, important documents, and whatnot then these external hard drives could be what you're looking for.</p>
      <p>The first is a 10TB WD My Book that's down to £142, which is 45% off its RRP. If that's not enough space for you, the 24TB My Book Duo is £398, and that's 34% off RRP. According to the super useful <a href="https://keepa.com/">Amazon price tracker Keepa app</a>, these are the cheapest prices either of them has ever been. You can view the rest of the current Black Friday deals below.</p>
