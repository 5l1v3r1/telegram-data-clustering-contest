      <h1>EVE MUIRHEAD: Plenty of scope to improve after Euro silver</h1>
      <h2>We were obviously gutted to lose out on gold at the European Championships on the last stone in the final.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Eve Muirhead</a></address>
      <p>But all in all I have to look back on the week as a successful one.</p>
      <p>Getting back on a podium at a major championships after returning from surgery and putting in all the hard hours of rehab was always the goal.</p>
      <p>Silver at the Euros is a reward for that and this feels like a big step forward for the team.</p>
      <p>We did what we needed to do in the round-robin but we really raised our game in the semi-final and the final was another high quality game of curling.</p>
      <p>It would have been a great advert for the sport because it was two teams with attacking tactics and there were so many switches of momentum.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, though, when you don’t have last stone advantage in the last end against a player of the quality of Anna Hasselborg you fear the worst.</p>
      <p>I certainly expected her to make the shot.</p>
      <p>They’re the Olympic champions for a reason and to see the way they celebrated at the end showed how hard we had pushed them.</p>
      <p>You have to remember that even though it was my 12th Euros, Vicky Wright in our team was competing in her first.</p>
      <p>And compared to the other top teams, who have been together for years, we’re in the early stages of our development.</p>
      <p>You would think they are probably at their peak but we’re nowhere near ours.</p>
      <p>For me personally it’s great to get confirmation that I can still compete and beat the best and to get confirmation that we can be strong enough as a rink to do the same.</p>
      <p>There’s a long time left until the Olympics and a lot of room left for us to reach our full potential.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>* <b>Talking of the Olympics, while I was in Sweden there was a headline that said the next one might be my last.</b></p>
      <p>I don’t know any athlete who looks two Games into the future and I’m certainly not.</p>
      <p>People always tell you that you compete for as long as you’re enjoying it and as long as you think you are capable of getting on to the podium.</p>
      <p>That is definitely my mindset.</p>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong, the injury and the surgery has made things harder but, don’t worry, I won’t be retiring anytime soon!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>*<b> I also heard while we were in Sweden that the curling rink at Braehead is going to close in March.</b></p>
      <p>It was really disappointing news.</p>
      <p>I have been an ambassador for the rink in the past and I’ve helped out at open sessions there.</p>
      <p>The Glynnhill Women’s International which was held there for six years was a prestigious competition and we competed at a Euros there a couple of years ago.</p>
      <p>It will come down to pounds and pence. I get that.</p>
      <p>But it’s also a real blow for the sport in this country.</p>
      <p>Glasgow is the biggest city in Scotland and apparently there will now be 40 clubs without a base.</p>
      <p>There is no other rink in the area so it seems inevitable that people will be lost to the game.</p>
