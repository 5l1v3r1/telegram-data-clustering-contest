      <h1>Jennifer Aniston, Jimmy Kimmel and the Friendsgiving enchiladas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:58:57+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:58</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – Jennifer Aniston posted a photo with her homemade enchiladas on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5aLMtwB0am/"><b>Instagram</b></a> on Thursday, along with a video of a rather amused Jimmy Kimmel.</p>
      <p>"Ok, @jimmykimmel... here are your f*%king Friendsgiving enchiladas," the star of <i>The Morning Show</i> wrote.</p>
      <p>Users in the comments section were in stitches when they saw the post, and you'd probably be too if you knew the back story.</p>
      <p>Exactly a year ago the <i>Friends</i> actress appeared on <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7ncj4rF-A"><b>Jimmy Kimmel Live</b></a></i> where she spoke about 'Friendsgiving' – Jennifer's annual party the day before Thanksgiving that Jimmy and his family attends. The late-night host had an apple to pick with the star though.</p>
      <p>"On Thanksgiving, I cook a lot of stuff. Turkey, yams, sweet potatoes. At your event, we have all of those things. So, then I'm making the same thing everyone had the night before, again. So, in essence, you turned my meal into leftovers."</p>
      <p>Jimmy suggested the 50-year-old embrace her love for Mexican food instead. "I know you love Mexican food. Graciasgiving would be a nice thing. Or Amigosgiving," Jimmy said.</p>
      <p>"If you start doing it, everyone will follow suit... Just like with your haircuts, everyone gets the same thing!"</p>
      <p>So she did.</p>
