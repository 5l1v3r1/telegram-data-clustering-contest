      <h1>Wolves to rival Liverpool, Manchester United for Leeds United loanee Ben White?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/brighton-and-hove-albion/"><b>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ben-white/"><b>Ben White</b></a> has reportedly emerged as a potential transfer target for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/wolves/"><b>Wolverhampton Wanderers</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>White has been a huge success on loan at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leeds-united/"><b>Leeds United</b></a> this season, contributing to a backline which has conceded just 10 goals from 18 matches in the Championship.</p>
      <p>As it stands, the 22-year-old is expected to return to Brighton at the end of the campaign to compete for a first-team spot at the Amex Stadium.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Athletic</i>, there are an increasing amount of clubs who are interested in signing the centre-back.</p>
      <p>As well as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a>, Wolves are also said to be ready to make an approach for White, who may cost in the region of Â£20m.</p>
      <p>White still has over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, leaving Brighton in a relatively strong position regarding the player's future.</p>
