      <p>Triumphant Tap O The Brae staff toasted being named Ayrshire Post’s Pub of the Year 2019.</p>
      <p>They raised a glass to all their customers who voted for them in their numbers to be crowned this year’s proud winner of the King of the pubs in Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>The popular Annbank boozer is family-run and owned by Danny and Marion Sloan. Danny’s brother is Auchinleck Talbot manager Tommy Sloan and their mum, Nessie, who is in her 80s, and the couple’s daughter Alex Fisher, work behind the bar.</p>
      <p>The Tap O The Brae beat off some strong competition to lift the title after almost 200 pubs and bars across the county entered this year’s competition.</p>
      <p>The owners were on a visit to York last week when Ayrshire Post visited their premises to award them their coveted prize.</p>
      <p>Danny’s sister, Karen Hamilton, who also works behind the bar, was delighted to pick up their prize on the couple’s behalf.</p>
      <p>After receiving the glass trophy from Ayrshire Post editor Gary Fanning, Karen beamed: “It feels great to be named Ayrshire Post Pub of the Year. I still can’t believe we won.</p>
      <p>“I am very happy. I must admit I was surprised.”</p>
      <p>Tap O The Brae was described as a popular spot for aficionados of the Ayrshire pub scene.</p>
