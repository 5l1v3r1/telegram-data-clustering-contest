      <p>Irishman O'Shea resigned as Italy head coach this month and was previously director of rugby at Harlequins.</p>
      <p>"I am privileged and honoured and it is an incredible opportunity to join at a really exciting time for English rugby," said the 49-year-old, who will become the RFU's director of performance rugby.</p>
      <p>"There is an exciting vision at the RFU. It is not just about winning tomorrow, but also about sustaining success and winning long into the future.</p>

      <p>"We can really look forward to rejuvenating and re-energising the performance pathway to help, support and push England rugby on."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nigel-melville/"><b>Nigel Melville</b></a> earlier announced he will step down as the RFU's director of professional rugby in December.</p>
      <p>Melville, who joined the governing body in July 2016, has opted to pursue new opportunities.</p>
      <p>"I am proud of all that the organisation has achieved over the last three years during some challenging times," said Melville.</p>
      <p>"I believe that England Rugby is in a great place and that leaving after the 2019 Rugby World Cup is the right time as the RFU start a new era and prepare for the next Rugby World Cup cycle."</p>

      <p>During Melville's tenure, Eddie Jones' England reached the World Cup final in Japan where they were beaten by South Africa earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old also acted as the RFU's interim chief executive in the first half of 2019, ahead of Bill Sweeney's arrival as CEO in May.</p>
      <p>Sweeney said: "On behalf of everyone at the RFU, I would like to thank Nigel for his valuable contribution to the organisation and to England Rugby.</p>
      <p>"His professionalism and knowledge of rugby and sport is outstanding and he will be missed. In particular, I am grateful for the support that he has given to me since I joined. He leaves with our very best wishes for the future."</p>
