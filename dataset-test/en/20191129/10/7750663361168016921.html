      <h1>Lewis Morgan delighted to take his chance with Celtic</h1>
      <h2>Stand-in centre forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-morgan/"><b>Lewis Morgan</b></a> was delighted to help <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/celtic/"><b>Celtic</b></a> achieve some club history in the Europa League with the opening goal in the 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/rennes/"><b>Rennes</b></a> at Parkhead on Thursday night.</h2>

      <p>The Hoops had already qualified for the last-32 but boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neil-lennon/"><b>Neil Lennon</b></a> was desperate to win in order for the club to top a group in the league for the first time, to ensure the possibility of a more favourable draw.</p>
      <p>Morgan, usually a winger, replaced injured French striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/odsonne-edouard/"><b>Odsonne Edouard</b></a> and opened the scoring with a confident finish in the 22nd minute for his second goal in green and white.</p>
      <p>Attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-christie/"><b>Ryan Christie</b></a> doubled that lead just before the interval.</p>

      <p>Second-half substitute <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikey-johnston/"><b>Mikey Johnston</b></a> added a third before Rennes substitute <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adrien-hunou/"><b>Adrien Hunou</b></a> headed in a late consolation for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Lennon's side moved on to 13 points – the first time they have broken the 10-point barrier – and with Cluj losing 1-0 to Lazio in Rome, the Hoops' pole position is guaranteed before they travel to Romania next month for the final Group E fixture.</p>
      <p>"It's a new position I have been working on in training for a month or so," Morgan told Celtic TV.</p>
      <p>"Obviously my chance came about through Odsonne getting injured and I just about took that chance.</p>

      <p>"I was delighted to get the goal and more importantly, delighted to get the three points and have a record points total for a group stage for Celtic.</p>
      <p>"We still have a game left and hopefully we can add more to that."</p>
      <p>Johnston was delighted to be back for the first time since September following injury and glad to be on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>"It has been a long, hard time off," he said.</p>
      <p>"To come back and get the goal will give me that confidence and belief again as it is very hard being injured.</p>
      <p>"I am just delighted.</p>
      <p>"I think this squad is special as the manager said.</p>
      <p>"We have been getting unbelievable results. Lazio are third in Serie A and we beat them home and away so we have a lot of quality in the group and a lot to give."</p>
