      <p>Terry Jones is ‘not doing terribly well’ in his fight against dementia, claims his Monty Python co-star Michael Palin.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Terry, 77, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia – an uncommon form of dementia which starts at a younger age, affects the front and sides of the brain and causes issues with behaviour and language.</p>
      <p>And his close friend Michael, 76, has admitted ‘it’s just a matter of time’ as he shared how the comedian’s condition has deteriorated.</p>
      <p>Palin was on the Zoe Ball Breakfast Show on Radio 2 this morning, when Zoe asked how Terry was doing.</p>

      <p>The comedy legend replied: ‘Well, not terribly well – the kind of dementia he has is not something that can be cured particularly. It’s just a matter of time. I go and see him, but he can’t speak much, which is a terrible thing.</p>

      <p>‘I mean, for someone who was so witty and verbal and articulate and argued and debated and all that to be deprived of speech is a hard thing.</p>
      <p>‘I still go and see him – actually the other day I did take a book that we’d written together in the 1980s called Bert Fegg’s Encyclopaedia Of All World Knowledge which was sort of an anarchist children’s book and I read some of it – the things we’d written together – and amazing, because Terry suddenly smiled and began to laugh. But the key thing was that he only laughed at the bits that he’d written!’</p>

      <p>As the studio burst into laughter, Michael added: ‘I thought – that shows that something is ticking over!’, with Zoe calling the moment ‘beautiful’ and thanking Palin for sharing it.</p>
      <p>A Fish Called Wanda star Michael had previously said that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/17/terry-jones-can-no-longer-recognise-monty-python-co-stars-due-dementia-10759248/">Terry no longer recognised him</a>, telling the Daily Star: ‘The last time I saw him I don’t think he recognised me. We knew each other well. It feels like a part of yourself isn’t there anymore.’</p>
      <p>Jones was responsible for writing much of Monty Python’s material, and directed Monty Python and The Holy Grail, Life of Brian and The Meaning Of Life.</p>
      <p>He is also a prolific children’s author and well-respected medieval historian.</p>
      <p>The comedy legend has been married to Anna Söderström since 2012, and they share 10-year-old daughter Siri; Jones is also father to Sally, 45, and Bill, 43, from his marriage to Alison Telfer.</p>
