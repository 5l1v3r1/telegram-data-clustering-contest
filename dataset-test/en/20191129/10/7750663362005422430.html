      <p>While Arsenal's form in the Premier League has come under intense scrutiny, their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/europa-league/result/result-pressure-grows-on-unai-emery-as-arsenal-slump-to-home-frankfurt-defeat_380964.html">2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the Europa League has heaped further pressure on the Gunners boss.</p>
      <p>With the north Londoners having failed to win any of their last seven matches in all competitions, <i>Sky Sports News</i> suggests that the 48-year-old is on the brink of an exit from the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>The report claims that a meeting will be held on Friday morning to discuss whether Emery should be removed from his position with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>As the final whistle went on Thursday evening, the club's home ground are almost empty, while banners calling for the departure of Emery had been displayed throughout the match.</p>
      <p>Arsenal must now decide whether to part company with Emery or allow him one final chance to get his team back on track at Norwich City on Sunday afternoon.</p>
