      <p><b>Bashir and his Islamist National Congress Party (NCP) had ruled the northeast African country since 1989 before a nationwide protest movement resulted in him being deposed earlier this year.<br/></b><b>Sudan's new authorities on Thursday ordered that the party of ousted autocrat Omar al-Bashir be dissolved and his regime "dismantled", heeding the call of protesters whose campaign led to the leader's overthrow.<br/></b> <br/>Bashir and his Islamist National Congress Party (NCP) had ruled the northeast African country since 1989 before a nationwide protest movement resulted in him being deposed earlier this year.<br/> <br/>The country's new ruling sovereign council and the cabinet led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok made the decision to dissolve the party, approving a law titled "Dismantling of the regime of 30th June 1989".<br/> <br/>"The National Congress Party is dissolved and its registration is cancelled from the list of political parties in Sudan," the decree said, adding that a committee would be formed to confiscate all its properties and assets.<br/> <br/>"None of the symbols of the regime or party would be allowed to engage in any political activity for 10 years".<br/> <br/>The dissolution of the party was "not a revenge" against the country's former rulers, Hamdok wrote on Twitter.<br/> <br/>"But it aims to preserve the dignity of Sudanese people which was crushed by dishonest people.<br/> <br/>"This law aims to recover the plundered wealth of the people."<br/> <br/>Wajdi Salah, a spokesman of the umbrella protest movement Forces of Freedom and Change, said on his Facebook page that the old regime party would be dismantled completely.<br/> <br/>The Sudanese Professionals Association, the protest group that had initially led the demonstrations against Bashir, praised the decision to dismantle the former regime.<br/> <br/>- Controversial law scrapped -<br/>"It is a major step towards achieving the goal of the revolution and on the path of building a democratic civilian state," the SPA said in a statement.<br/> <br/>Thousands of Sudanese rallied late last month in several cities, urging the new authorities to dissolve the former ruling party.<br/> <br/>Bashir and the NCP had ruled Sudan with an iron fist since he seized power in 1989 by overthrowing the elected government of prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi.<br/> <br/>On Thursday, the sovereign council and the cabinet also formally scrapped the controversial public-order law that had severely curtailed women's rights in the country during Bashir's rule.<br/> <br/>Thousands of women were flogged, fined and even jailed under the archaic law that activists said primarily targeted women through harsh interpretations of Islamic sharia law.<br/> <br/>Under the law those who consumed or brewed alcohol -- banned in the country -- were punished, while activists said security forces used the law to arrest women for attending private parties or wearing trousers.<br/> <br/>The controversial law had led to simmering anger among women for decades.<br/> <br/>Women were at the forefront of the demonstrations that erupted in December 2018 against Bashir.<br/> <br/>The protests quickly turned into a nationwide anti-regime movement that finally led to his ouster.<br/> <br/>The army deposed him on April 11 in a palace coup, and in August a joint civilian and military sovereign council was formed to oversee the country's transition to civilian rule as demanded by protesters.<br/> <br/>A civilian-led cabinet headed by Hamdok is charged with the day-to-day running of the country.<br/> <br/>Bashir is being held in a prison in Khartoum facing trial on charges of corruption. Several other officials of his government and senior party members are also in jail.  </p>
