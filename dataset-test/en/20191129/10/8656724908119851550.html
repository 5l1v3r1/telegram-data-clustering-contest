      <p>There has always been a debate when it comes to smartphone camera picture quality versus the number of megapixels it packs. The trend has been advanced further by companies like Xiaomi and Samsung who collaborated to come up with a 108 megapixel sensor.</p>
      <p>We have seen megapixel (mp) push in smartphone cameras before. It all started with 4 mp then 8 to 12 until we got the <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/tech-stripped-lumia-1020-camera-disected-we-drool/">41 megapixel Nokia Lumia 1020</a>, which for a while was a king of smartphone photography. But, it seemed like every time we got a higher mp number, then that became the the smartphone camera king– even though megapixels didn’t mean everything.</p>
      <p>Just because something has a 16 megapixel camera, doesn’t mean its necessarily better than a 12 mp camera. In fact, a lot of times its the other way around. Now am sure you have noticed that we’ve sort of settled around everyone having 12 mp cameras, but 108 megapixels– that has to mean something.</p>
      <h3>So what does 108 megapixels actually mean?</h3>

      <p>The resolution of one photo from a typical 12 megapixel camera like the iPhone is around 4032 x 3024 pixels which totals around 12,192,768 pixels — 12 megapixels. The same scene from 108 megapixel camera comes in at 12,032 x 9024 pixels which is multiplied to get you 108,576,768 pixels –108 megapixels.</p>
      <p>So you are getting about 3 times the vertical and horizontal resolution to make these numbers and this means bigger files sizes per images around 20- 30 MBs compared to 3- 10 MBs on a 12 mp phone. At the end of the day before you buy such hyped camera phones you have to ask yourself how good the photos will look.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of things that contribute to the quality of a photo apart from megapixels; color accuracy, exposure, dynamic range, contrast, etc. But the main thing you are going to notice with such a high resolution is sharpness and detail. So, expect photos taken in the 108 megapixel mode to be significantly sharper and more detailed than any other smartphone especially when you have enough light source.</p>
      <p>Here are the current 108 megapixel phones you can buy or to soon be launched</p>
      <h3>Xiaomi Mi Note 10</h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/so-whats-special-about-a-108-megapixel-cameraphone/">Mi Note 10</a> packs five rear cameras: the aforementioned flagship 108-megapixel wide angle lens, a 5-megapixel telephoto with 5x optical zoom (and 10x hybrid zoom), a 12-megapixel telephoto camera designed for portrait mode shots, a 20-megapixel ultra-wide with a 117-degree field of view, and a 2-megapixel macro lens for close-up shots. There’s also a sixth 32-megapixel camera on the front of the phone, which is housed in a teardrop-style notch.</p>

      <h3>Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha</h3>
      <p>This a <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/the-xiaomis-mi-mix-alpha-is-a-taste-of-the-future-of-smartphones/">futuristic phone from Xiaomi</a> which has a “surround screen” that wraps entirely around the device to the point where it meets the camera module on the other side.</p>
      <p>The Mi Mix Alpha uses Samsung’s new 108MP Ultra High-resolution Camera called the Samsung HMX, with 12032 x 9024 ultra-high resolution, 0.8μm, 1/1.33″ image sensor size, laser focus. A 20MP ultra wide-angle camera this is the SONY IMX350, 20MP, 1.0μm 1/2.8″ image sensor size, laser focus 1.5cm macro photography. And, finally a 12MP Samsung telephoto camera called the S5K2L7, 12MP, 1.4μm, 1/2.55″ image sensor size, supports Dual PD Phase detection focus, laser focus.</p>
      <p>The phone will go into small-scale production this year and go on sale in December for 19,999 yuan, or about UGX 10.5 m ($2,800).</p>
      <h3>Samsung Galaxy S11 (2020)</h3>

      <p>If recent rumors and leaks are to be believed, Samsung’s next flagship will tout a 108 megapixel camera. Its only logical since they own the sensor technology the<a href="http://xiaomi.com/"> Xiaomi</a> is currently using. The OnLeaks renders show a device that looks fairly similar to the Note 10 from the front, with a bezel-less display and a center-located cutout for a single front-facing camera.</p>
      <p>The back is where things look to be a little more interesting, with five camera sensors one of then should be Samsung’s own 108MP Ultra High-resolution Camera called the Samsung HMX, with 12032 x 9024 ultra-high resolution, 0.8μm, 1/1.33″ image sensor size, laser focus. Given that Samsung tends to announce its S-model phones in February, and the flood of leaks that tend to accompany new hardware, expect to see plenty more on the S11 in the near future</p>
