      <p>Jeremy McConnell and his girlfriend Katie McCreath have welcomed a baby daughter - the second child for CBB star Jez.</p>
      <p>It came after he said his newborn girl would be his "main focus" having not seen toddler son Caben-Albi since he was a baby.</p>
      <p>The pair announced the happy news this morning, with a pal telling the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10447799/jeremy-mcconnell-become-dad-baby-girl-girlfriend-katie-gives-birth/">Sun</a> : "He says she is so beautiful, she is unreal and he finally has the family he’s always wanted."</p>
      <p>"Katie was so amazing and is doing really well," they added.</p>
      <p>Jeremy already has son Caben with his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Davis, who he was convicted of assaulting.</p>

      <p>Jeremy recently hit back at claims he was "neglecting" their youngster.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/">MailOnline</a> : "Anyone that has half a brain cell needs to understand the reason I am not part of Caben's life is because not every situation can be fixed."</p>
      <p>He added: "I protect my son as much as I can. It's not neglecting, it's protecting. I'm a very loving father. This is better for Caben.</p>
      <p>"My priority is my baby girl because it's in my control – I have rights over that. My main focus is my girl."</p>

      <p>He's been praised by other half Katie, who says he's more organised than she is when it comes to preparing for the arrival of their baby.</p>
      <p>She took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> in October to share a snap of the drawers in her nursery packed to the brim with baby clothes and towels.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Time to pack the hospital bag Mr Organised @jeremymcconnellcooke is on it tonight with the list .... I’m Mrs Last minute so it will be strange been so on schedule.</p>

      <p>"I’ve got big pants and some comfy slippers for me spritz for bitz on order ... and all the basics for her ! Less than 7 weeks to go."</p>
      <p>When Jeremy announced his baby news, he said he'd always wanted to be a dad - despite already fathering one child.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Alot of things out there are not always how they are portrayed. I have wanted nothing more than to be a dad in life and I thank the people who have used their initiative to understand that. All I want is a happy family life away from any negativity."</p>

      <p>The former model, who spent time in jail for jetting out to Turkey for a hair transplant rather than doing the community service for his assault, recently admitted to years of cocaine abuse.</p>
      <p>Jeremy said he'd been clean of the drug for 18 months after turning over a new leaf in prison, and confessed coke had been "rotting his brain".</p>
      <p>"Everything was a blur - cocaine takes anything that's important to you away. It's not cool, it leads you down a slippery path - it's the devil," he told the Sun.</p>
      <p>"The thing is, I never even had a good night out on cocaine.</p>
      <p>"But it was easy to fall into as socially it's everywhere and curiosity and peer pressure really drives the problem."</p>
