      <p>Earlier this month it was announced that bassist <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/black-veil-brides-part-ways-with-bassist-ashley-purdy/">Ashley Purdy had “mutually agreed to part ways” with Black Veil Brides</a>, and now the band have revealed their new four-stringer to be Lonny Eagleton.</p>
      <p>“Thrilled to announce that I am joining <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/black-veil-brides/">Black Veil Brides</a> as their new bassist,” <a href="https://twitter.com/LonnyEagleton/status/1200281001919827968/photo/1">posted Lonny on Twitter</a>. “Having been a longtime dedicated fan of this band, I could not be more grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this new era. Before I had any affiliation with the members, I used to fantasize about playing in this band, playing the music, wearing the makeup and stage outfits, so for that to now become my reality is completely surreal.</p>
      <p>“It was only a couple years ago that I was standing in the audience at their concerts, singing along, trying to catch guitar picks. To now see myself in the videos, and hear myself on the recordings is a feeling I can’t even begin to explain. I look forward to this new beginning as the newest member of Black Veil Brides.”</p>

      <p>Black Veil Brides have also announced they will be releasing a string of two-track EPs, known as duologies. The first EP – The Night, out now via Sumerian – features the tracks Saints Of Blood and The Vengeance, which you can listen to below.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.altpress.com/features/black-veil-brides-interview-the-night-ep/">Speaking to Alt Press</a>, frontman Andy Biersack said: “With the feeling of nostalgia on this one, going back into the time when we were doing the re-record [of We Stitch These Wounds], the idea was to add two songs that felt very much like the band that we were in the past and maybe strayed away from [and] return to that form.</p>
      <p>“Quite honestly, when you’ve been a band as long as we have and put out five full-length records, EPs and everything else, you want to do new stuff,” he continued. “I think this is a model that we’re really excited about, and moving forward, it’s a sustainable model that we can do, something that allows us to write songs together and release music, do music videos and artwork, bring it to people and say, ‘This is the new thing.’ And then half a year later, there’s another new thing.”</p>
