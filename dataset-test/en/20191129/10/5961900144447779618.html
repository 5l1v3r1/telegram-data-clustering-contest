      <h1>Ciarran Stott Is Officially Moving To Syd &amp; If He’s Not The Next Bachie Then We Fkn Riot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:45:52+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">By Steffanie Tan</a></address>
      <p>Without a doubt, <b>Ciarran Stott</b>‘s exit from <i>The Bachelorette </i>earlier this year was easily one of the most heart-wrenching of the franchise yet. And it’s because Ciarran is a) a genuinely fabulous man who won over the hearts and minds of viewers and b) he and bachelorette <b>Angie Kent </b>– who ended up picking <b>Carlin Sterritt </b>– had such a genuine connection. C’est la vie, as they say. But it appears Ciarran is making da moves, because he’s leaving Darwin for Sydney – otherwise known as bachelor land.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, after Ciarran made his decision to leave <i>The Bachelor</i>, he told PEDESTRIAN.TV that he was absolutely keen to be the next bachie.</p>
      <p>“Yeah definitely, I would take that opportunity,” he said. “That’s been the question of the day, really.”</p>
      <p>At the time, Ciarran said he hadn’t been approached by <i>Bachie </i>producers yet, but he’d “definitely go for it”. And why wouldn’t he? He’s a great, charming, sensitive bloke and we (I) need more of him on TV.</p>
      <p>“Looks like a fresh new chapter is starting very soon for myself and I can’t wait,” he captioned a beach pic of himself on Instagram. “Sydney you are on my horizon. New chapter means new beginnings and I’m so excited!”</p>
      <p>UM, HELLO: “New chapter means new beginnings” is 10/10 something The Bachelor would say.</p>

      <p>That eye emoji, though.</p>
      <p>Okay, a list of possibilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>The Bachelor </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>The Bachelor</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>The Bachelor</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Did I miss anything? I don’t think so. At the least, surely he’s on <i>The Bachelor in Paradise. </i>SURELY.</p>
      <p>My dramatic self aside, best of luck to the legend and whatever he decides to do in Sydney.</p>
