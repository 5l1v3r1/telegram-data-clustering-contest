      <p>Mr. Blay in his quest for the chairmanship position of the NPP promised to deliver 275 buses to each constituency office of the NPP to aid party officials in the discharge of their duties.</p>
      <p>The promise, which was attributed to his victory, generated a lot of controversies with many questioning his source of income.</p>
      <p>The NPP chairman has been dragged to court over the issue.</p>
      <p>Reacting on the charges on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a>, an emotional Mr. Blay said he had not been given a fair hearing.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pity this country we don’t investigate to get the facts. We condemn people before getting the facts. They accuse me of corruption without knowing the facts,” he said.</p>
      <p>The NPP Chairman, peeved over the issue, also accused CHRAJ of being “mischievous” for asking him to produce the custom declaration forms and other documents covering duties paid for the vehicle.</p>
      <p>“People try to make it look like I have stolen money but it’s not my money, it’s a loan facility,” he stressed.</p>
