      <p>It can be a daunting process bringing a beloved comic book character to life, let alone one as popular as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/harley-quinn-tv/">Harley Quinn</a>, who has a new <a href="https://screenrant.com/harley-quinn-show-spoilers-dc-email/amp/">adult animated series</a> on <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/dc-universe/">DC Universe</a>.</p>

And also, my voice is very recognizable, so I didn't want to force an accent or try to be someone I'm not.
