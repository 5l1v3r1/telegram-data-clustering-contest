      <p>A PE teacher from Irvine has been crowned a bodybuilding world champion.</p>
      <p>Ross Taylor, 30, won the World Natural Bodybuilding Bantamweight title at a glamorous finals event in New York last week.</p>
      <p>Now he’s able to compete for money alongside the biggest names in the sport after earning a pro-card.</p>
      <p>Ross, who won the British lightweight title in October, admits he put his life on hold for six months to prepare for the event.</p>
      <p>He juggled married life and an intense fitness and diet programme with his job at St Matthew’s Academy in Saltcoats.</p>
      <p>“It was tough but definitely worth it, he said.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s been great especially my wife Stacey. The kids at school have given me a bit of a rinsing about my fake tan though!”</p>
      <p>Ross insists he’ll bide his time before muscling in on the professional circuit and money-spinning events.</p>
      <p>He’ll worry about that in a years’ time as he puts family and work life first again after a crazy 2019.</p>
      <p>“The way the pro-card works you have to compete within the next two years if you don’t want to lose it,” said Ross who teaches PE at St Matthew’s Academy in Saltcoats.</p>

      <p>“I’ll be taking 2020 off and then going again in 2021.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a really tough six months, not just for me but my wife Stacey.</p>
      <p>“It’s been six days a week in the gym, and 28 weeks of dieting with no cheat meals to get ready.</p>
      <p>“There were moments I wanted to jack it all in but Stacey kept me going.</p>
      <p>“She’s been really understanding about everything I’ve had to do to prepare myself.</p>
      <p>“We actually met at the gym so she knows the mentality you need to adopt .</p>
      <p>“She couldn’t be with me in New York but there were tears shed from both us when I won.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t think it’s actually sunk in yet but I’m over the moon.”</p>
      <p>Ross also admits he owes a massive deal of gratitude to the coaches at Irvine’s Fitness Factory – where he trains – who helped get him in tip-top condition.</p>
      <p>“David Jackson and John Montgomery have been coaching me since I was a teenager and the time and effort they’ve put into me has been unbelievable, he added. “Without their help and dedication I wouldn’t have been able to come this far."</p>

      <p>Ross’ fascination with fitness began when he was 15 but he really started taking it seriously when he turned 21.</p>
      <p>Four years later he was crowned Scottish champion but he then took the decision to take some time away from the sport.</p>
      <p>Last year, he decided to pour his heart and soul back into it, juggling his preparations with married life and his teaching job.</p>
      <p>Ross went on: “Everyone at the school was brilliant and very supportive of me.</p>
      <p>“I basically have to eat constantly when I’m training and the school staff always made sure I had first dibs at the microwave at break and lunchtimes.</p>
      <p>“When I got back from New York the headteacher made a wee announcement over the tannoy which was really nice.</p>
      <p>“The pupils have been great with me too.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been getting the Shannon Briggs chant ‘Let’s go Champ’ quite a bit which has been funny."</p>
