        <b>The child character affectionately referred to as ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/totally-fine-call-mandalorians-baby-yoda-baby-yoda-11193998/">Baby Yoda</a>’ in The Mandalorian has taken the internet by storm.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This cutie first appeared at the end of the first episode and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/mandalorian-introduces-baby-yoda-star-wars-fans-obviously-internet-cannot-handle-11089019/">promptly broke the internet</a> because, well, look at that little face!</p>
      <p>Even though we can’t watch <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/the-mandalorian-explained-who-is-the-asset-and-what-does-it-mean-for-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-11182734/">The Mandalorian</a> in the UK just yet, we’ve already <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/26/giphy-apologises-removing-gifs-adorable-mandalorian-character-baby-yoda-11219710/">gone wild over Baby Yoda</a>, and speculation as to who and what they really are is rife…</p>
      <h3>What species is Baby Yoda in The Mandalorian?</h3>
      <p>Very little is known about Yoda’s species, which makes Baby Yoda’s reveal all the more exciting.</p>
      <p>What we do know is that their species ages at a vastly different rate than humans, as the infant is actually 50 years old, and Yoda was 900 years old when he died of old age in Return of the Jedi.</p>

      <p>Other than in The Mandalorian, we’ve only ever seen one other creature like Yoda, who appeared in the prequel trilogy in the form of a female Jedi Council member called Yaddle.</p>

      <p>Since we know the Force works in mysterious ways in the Star Wars universe, one theory is that Baby Yoda could actually be Yoda reincarnated.</p>
      <p>Another possibility could be that the only thing tying Baby Yoda to actual Yoda is their species, which would be interesting enough on its own given how little we know about them.</p>
      <p>While there’s been some debate online as to whether or not it’s ok to refer to the little green infant as ‘Baby Yoda’ since they are not the actual Jedi master, who died before the events in the show, The Mandalorian director Dave Filoni spoke on the matter and settled it, giving us the ok to use the nickname.</p>
      <p>‘That’s fine, all part of the mystery,’ Filoni said. He then added to ET reporter Ash Crossan: ‘But it’s very clear, it’s very clear.’</p>

      <p>The fourth episode of The Mandalorian was released on Disney Plus today at 3:24am EST, which is 8:24am UK time.</p>
      <p>However the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/can-watch-mandalorian-star-wars-spin-off-dont-disney-11006742/">UK does not currently have access to Disney Plus</a> – for that, we’ll have to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/watch-mandalorian-uk-11085161/">wait until March 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s not all doom and gloom however, as Jon Favreau has already confirmed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/mandalorian-season-2-already-filming-excited-11125255/">season two of The Mandalorian has already started filming</a>.</p>
