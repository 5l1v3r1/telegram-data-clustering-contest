      <p>Hon Grant Robertson</p>
      <p>Minister of Finance</p>

      <p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
      <p>Govt accounts show strong debt position, impact of tax timing changes</p>
      <p>The Government’s books are in good shape, with low debt and expenses close to forecast, Finance Minister Grant Robertson says.</p>
      <p>“A strong position, with expenses under control, is important for the Government. There are continued warnings about the state of the global economy, with issues like the US-China trade war and Brexit throwing up increased uncertainty.</p>
      <p>“Our strong debt position gives us the space for further opportunities to invest to strengthen the economy, particularly in infrastructure,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
      <p>The Treasury today released the Crown accounts for the four months to October. Net debt at 20.2% of GDP was below the 20.8% forecast, while expenses were within 0.6% of forecast.</p>
      <p>The accounts continued to show the temporary impact on the OBEGAL position from Inland Revenue’s new system for recognising revenue.</p>
      <p>This has affected when revenue is recognised in the accounts during the year, mainly for corporate tax. The corporate tax measure which feeds into the OBEGAL was 28% below forecast over the four months – but Treasury says this is temporary and set to reverse out over the year as the timing issue evens out.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the actual cash amount of corporate tax collected in the four months, it’s 10% ahead of forecasts,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
      <p>The impact of the timing issues on the monthly OBEGAL position was clearly signalled when the Government released the Financial Statements in October.</p>
      <p>The Treasury and Inland Revenue are working closely to fully understand how the new system impacts the timing for recognising revenue.</p>
      <p>They’re also discussing why and how their respective forecasts have been different – corporate tax in the four months was much closer to Inland Revenue’s forecast. The Treasury includes its own tax estimates in the Budget forecasts, not Inland Revenue’s.</p>
      <p>This is the last set of monthly accounts before new forecasts are released at the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update on 11 December.</p>
