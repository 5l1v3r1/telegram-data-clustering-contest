      <p>Yesterday marked Thanksgiving 2019 across and all our stars celebrated it with utmost enthusiasm. One such feast took place at Rachel AKA Jennifer Aniston’s residence and it was all about reunions for the actress! The celebrations weren’t only attended by FRIENDS co-star and her good friend Courtney Cox, but her ex-husband Justin Theroux, too, was a part of the memorable night. It was in the year 2017 that Jen and Justin announced their split after two years of marriage: however, the bond they share today remains the same and, of course, special. (ALSO READ -<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/hollywood/hollywood_news/jennifer-aniston-makes-f-king-friendsgiving-enchiladas-for-jimmy-kimmel-after-his-complaint-last-year-video/5ddfd1a302fcc96b801da9d0">Jennifer Aniston Makes ‘F**king FRIENDSgiving Enchiladas’ For Jimmy Kimmel After His Complaint Last Year-VIDEO</a>)</p>

      <p>As soon as Jennifer Aniston had made her rocking Instagram debut, she had crashed the photo-sharing site, quite literally. The actress had crossed a whopping 1 million followers in some hours, resulting in certain glitches for others; the list also included her ex-hubby Justin Theroux. And, as a result of the same, he couldn’t follow the actress. Jen, in no time, messaged Justin and complained about the same. LOL!</p>
