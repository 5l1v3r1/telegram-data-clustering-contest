      <p>Apple launched its Black Friday deals just after midnight on Friday, with gift cards back on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Those gift cards range from $25 to $200, as detailed below. For each of the products listed, you’ll pay full price for the product and then get the gift card back for a future purchase.</p>
      <p>Mathematically, the best deals are on the entry level models, as the discounts are the same no matter the specs. I’ll also add that the Mac discounts are solid, as is the discount on both iPad Pro models. A 21.5-inch iMac starting at $899 is great, while the much-better 27-inch model effectively starts at $1,599. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro effectively starts at $1,099, also a good deal.</p>
      <p>All gift card offers are good Friday through Monday. We have all the details below, and you can find all of these products on the <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/1321975/435031/7613">Apple Store</a>.</p>
