      <h1>Samsung Note 10 sales surpass predecessor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:10:08+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author">Simnikiwe Mzekandaba</a></address>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is already out-performing its predecessor, the Note 9, in the South African market.</p>
      <p>This is according to Sung Yoon, Samsung Africa president and CEO, speaking at the company’s ‘Empowering Tomorrow’ event this week.</p>
      <p>“The Note 10 is actually the best performer sales-wise, selling 50% more than the Note 9 for the same period.”</p>
      <p>This year, Samsung <a href="https://www.itweb.co.za/content/JN1gPvO1DYWMjL6m">unveiled</a> a range of new premium devices, including the Galaxy S10e, S10, Note 10 and the <a href="https://www.itweb.co.za/content/j5alr7QlDgKvpYQk">highly-anticipated</a>Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>In October, the company celebrated the 10th year of Galaxy smartphones in SA through the ‘Power of 10’ celebration, which coincided with the brand’s 50 global anniversary and 25th anniversary in the country.</p>
      <p>As part of the celebration, Yoon said the company decided to empower South African youth through its Empowering Tomorrow initiative.</p>

      <p>The initiative is part of wide-ranging efforts to uplift learners and students in the country, according to the company. Samsung awards bursaries to students currently pursuing studies in business, law, marketing and IT, among other fields.</p>
      <p>The students are from the universities of Pretoria, North-West, Witwatersrand and Johannesburg, as well as Gauteng City Region Academy (GCRA), an entity of the Gauteng Department of Education.</p>
      <p>This week, Samsung hosted bursary recipients and officials from the GCRA. The GCRA is responsible for promoting skills development in the Gauteng city region.</p>
      <p>At the event, the South Korean-based electronics giant announced that following an initial R7 million bursary investment this year, it will award another R7 million for 2020.</p>
      <p>The company said the best-performing students would get the opportunity to work at Samsung as part of a leadership programme.</p>
      <p>“We are continuously working to build on and expand the programmes we offer to young people across South Africa. Samsung is committed to improving the use of IT in education, providing access to smarter learning environments to support students’ creativity and reduce the digital divide,” says Hlubi Shivanda, director for business innovation group and corporate affairs at Samsung SA.</p>
      <p>“We strive to reduce local education gaps and turn potential into power.”</p>
