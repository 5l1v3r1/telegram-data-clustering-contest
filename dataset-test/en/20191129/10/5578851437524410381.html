        <b>Thousands of supporters of Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah’s election campaign team marched from different parts of Kabul and converged near the Presidential on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A statement read at the gathering called for the “people’s voice to be heard” and for “fraud” to be prevented in the election.</p>
      <p>Two months after the September election, preliminary results have still not been announced by the Independent Election Commission.</p>
      <p>An ongoing vote recount has been delayed by members of Abdullah’s campaign team who have shut down local election centers in the provinces.</p>
      <p>Abdullah’s team, along with other election teams, contend that several hundred thousand votes currently in the IEC tally are fraudulent and should be removed.</p>
      <p>The routes to downtown Kabul were closed to traffic early on Friday morning by security forces who instructed protestors to choose Chaman-e-Hozoori area as their final destination instead of Pashtunistan Square, which is in front of the Presidential Palace. But the protestors made attempts to reach their pre-planned destination.</p>
      <p>Senior members of the Stability and Convergence campaign team -- politicians and former politicians -- were among the protestors.</p>
      <p>Abdullah’s Stability and Convergence Team has stated the following:</p>
      <p>“The ‘fraud’ team, the international community, and the election commission should hear the people’s voice. We will defend their rights.”</p>
      <p>The IEC should “immediately” remove the 300,000 fraudulent votes and it should prove its impartially.</p>
      <p>The international community should act responsibly to guide the electoral process back towards a legal path. The international partners should not allow Afghanistan to return to a dark past. The 2019 presidential election is a line separating dictatorship and democracy.</p>
      <p>The security forces should ensure the safety of the protestors and should stay impartial in the process.</p>
      <p>“If the IEC and other stakeholders do not respond to the legitimate demands of the Stability and Convergence campaign team, we will use all legitimate, peaceful and people-oriented options to uproot fraud and take power through the legitimate votes of the people.”</p>
      <p>“We still support the people’s movement to prevent the vote recount process.”</p>
      <p>This comes as the IEC chief Hawa Alam Nuristani on Thursday reiterated that the vote recount process will continue, and she assured the public that only biometric-based votes will be counted.</p>
      <p>She called on the candidates to cooperate with the vote recount process, which she claimed has been completed in 26 provinces.</p>
      <p>The Stability and Convergence campaign team has specified four categories of fraudulent votes:</p>
      <p>• 137,630 votes that were originally flagged for irregularities but are now counted in the total tally.</p>
      <p>• 102,012 votes which were cast before or after election day, based on the timestamp of the biometric devices.</p>
      <p>• Votes validated by duplicate photos or photos of photos.</p>
      <p>• Votes from 700 devices and memory cards that were lost.</p>
