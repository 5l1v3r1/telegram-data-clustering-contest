      <h1>Mariz on having a baby: In God's own time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:36:11+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/mario-bautista" target="_blank">Mario Bautista</a></address>
      <h3>MARIZ Umali is the newest member of “Unang Hirit” as she just replaced Rhea Santos who migrated to Canada. “Bale I joined them last July lang,” she says. “I want to thank Igan Arnold Clavio and everyone kasi they’re all very warm. Tinanggap nila ako agad. Talagang na-feel ko agad na mga kaibigan silang walang iwanan at masaya silang kasama.”</h3>
      <p>Because “Unang Hirit” is a morning show, she has to wake up at 4 AM. “I’m very thankful to my husband (broadcaster Raffy Tima) as he’s very supportive at hinahatid niya talaga ako sa studio every morning then he just goes back to sleep,” she says.</p>
      <p>They’ll soon celebrate their 7th wedding anniversary and, as usual, they’re being pressured about having a baby. “Siguro I have to take a long break from work to achieve that,” says Mariz. “Kasi, right now, after ‘Unang Hirit’, I go to work right away as a field reporter and I have to go where the action is. So tungkol sa pagbe-baby, we lift it up to the Lord. In God’s own time, siguro, bibigyan Niya rin kami ng baby namin.”</p>
      <p>Right now, she’s enjoying her job as a news person very much. “17 years na ko sa GMA since I started here as researcher right after I graduated from masscomm in UP. I’m very happy with my work kasi kunsaan-saan na ako nakarating dahil dito. My most memorable is covering the canonization of Pope John Paul II kasi I saw him in person during World Youth Day. Now, my newest assignment is to go to South Korea from November 29 to December 4 upon the invitation of Korean Tourism to feature their culture, their food, their scenic spots. Excited ako kasi fan talaga ako ng Koreanovela at sana maka-meet ako roon ng Korean actors.”</p>
