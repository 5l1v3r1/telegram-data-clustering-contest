      <p>In a recent development, the Plantashun Boyz members, 2Face Idibia also known as 2Baba and Blackface have opted for an out-of-court settlement for their ongoing feud.</p>
      <p>Both artistes agreed to sheath their respective swords after they signed an undisclosed settlement agreement at the Ikeja High Court, Lagos on Wednesday, November 27.</p>
      <p>According to reports. the gentleman agreement also saw the African Queen crooner dropped the N50m defamation suit filed against Blackface.</p>
      <p>A source close to both singers stated that Blackface agreed not to publicly call out 2Face while the latter agreed to work out an agreement that will enable the former to earn royalties.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“After the successful mediation, Blackface promised not to publicly accuse 2baba again while 2baba agreed to make all the necessary corrections and amendments that had prevented Black Face from receiving royalties.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The latest development came after 2Baba dared Blackface to sue him if he has concrete evidence against him instead of engaging in a smear campaign.</p>
      <p>Blackface further confirmed they were indeed in court on Instagram where he shared a photo with his lawyers. “Earlier today @ the Ikeja high court with my #legalteam Thanks for una support and services, Details coming soon.”</p>
      <p>Recall that Blackface earlier in the year declared total war on his former music groupmate, 2Face Idibia.</p>
      <p>The singer warned that 2Face’s career is going to end once the war is over.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Can the #WAR officially begin @official2baba? I say it has now #officially… even though you had been taking secret shots but you can come out in the open now. You know your career is going to end when this is finally over #youareoverwith2019.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Their feud has been a longstanding one with threats of taking legal action from both parties. Investigation revealed that their altercation started following the break-up of their former group, Plantashun Boyz in 2004, and Blackface claiming he wrote the classic song, <i>African Queen,</i> which has remained one of 2Face’s all-time biggest hit. The song was part of the Implication crooner’s debut solo album, Face2Face.</p>
      <p>Just when we thought the feud was over, their enmity continued in 2014, when <i>Let Somebody Love You</i>, another single off 2Face’s Ascension album was alleged to have contained lyrics written by Blackface, which prompted him to raise a fuss on various media platforms alleging that 2Face stole the song from him.</p>
      <p>Things took a turn for the worse in 2018 when 2Face dragged Blackface Naija to court in a N50 million lawsuit, and 2Face’s manager, Efe Omoroge saying it is for defamation of character.</p>
      <p>The second verse was entirely 2Baba. Bridget Kelly wrote her verse and Efe Omorogbe wrote the outro verse,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the lawsuit at the time, Blackface revealed that his legal team was taking care of the matter, adding that he was prepared to meet 2face in court.</p>
      <p>The out of court settlement will reduce the feud between the two and will reduce further social media outbursts.</p>
