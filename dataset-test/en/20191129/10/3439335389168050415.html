      <p>A large fight in Hilo on Monday led to four arrests, two injured police officers and a slew of charges made.</p>
      <p>At about 10:45 p.m. Monday, Hawaii island police officers responded to a large and loud gathering, estimated to have 40 people, at Kinoole Street and made multiple attempts to disperse individuals.</p>
      <p>A police media release then said that officers were aggressively approached by intoxicated individuals, who assaulted the officers to interfere with the arrest.</p>
      <p>One of the two officers was transported via ambulance to the Hilo Medical Center Emergency Room, while the other was treated at the scene.</p>
      <p>The four adults, one woman and three men between the ages 18 and 39, arrested were charged with a variety of offenses, including assault against a law enforcement officer in the first-degree, resisting arrest, failure to disperse and obstructing government operations. Their bails ranged from $750 to $23,000.</p>
      <p>A juvenile male was also charged with similar offenses, including assault against a law enforcement officer.</p>
      <p>The adults are in police custody and the East Hawaii Detention Center until their court appearance. The juvenile was released into state custody.</p>
