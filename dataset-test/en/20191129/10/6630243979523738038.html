      <p>Sudan’s transitional government has abolished a law criminalizing immoral conduct and indecent clothing that rights groups criticize as targeting women and say is a holdover from the three-decade rule of toppled autocrat Omar al-Bashir.</p>
      <p>Sudan’s sovereign council and cabinet announced early Friday that they would overturn the notorious Public Order Act, and also order the dissolving of al-Bashir’s National Congress Party.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy groups in the country have held fresh protests demanding the former ruling party’s disbandment.</p>
      <p>The sovereign council grew out of a power-sharing agreement between the country’s ruling generals and protesters demanding sweeping political change. It includes both military and civilian members.</p>
      <p>Women played an important role in the mass protests that led to al-Bashir’s overthrow in April. The transitional government includes Sudan’s first female foreign minister, Asmaa Abdallah.</p>
