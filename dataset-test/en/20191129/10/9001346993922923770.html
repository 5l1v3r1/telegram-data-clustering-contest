      <p>Four banks teamed up with the Dutch government and authorities to fight against financial service providers who launder money for criminals, Financieele Dagblad reported on Friday based on information from an anonymous source.</p>
      <p>According to FD, ABN Amro, ING, Rabobank and Volksbank signed a covenant with the National Police, the FIOD, the Public Prosecution Service, and financial intelligence unit FIU. This "serious crime task force" will focus on upper world lackeys who facilitate undermining crime. </p>
      <p>The authorities believe that financial advisers like tax advisers, notaries, accountants and lawyers play a key role in laundering drug money in the Netherlands. </p>
      <p>An anonymous source told the newspaper that the first investigation is already underway.</p>
      <p>An estimated<a href="https://nltimes.nl/2019/11/13/money-launderers-annually-wash-eu13-billion-netherlands"> 13 billion euros in criminal money is laundered in the Netherlands every year</a>. </p>
