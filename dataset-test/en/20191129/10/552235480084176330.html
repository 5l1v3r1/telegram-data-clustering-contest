      <p>A pervert who sexually assaulted a woman has been spared further jail time- despite a background report warning that there’s a “high risk” his criminal behaviour will continue.</p>
      <p>Ross Pettigrew appeared from custody at Ayr Sheriff Court on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old admitted three charges on the indictment which included sexually assaulting a women at a property in Dalmellington on June 23 by touching her leg and breast through her clothing.</p>
      <p>Pettigrew, a prisoner of HM Kilmarnock, further admitting seizing hold of a dog and attempting to steal it on the same date and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, entering a property uninvited, kicking bins and a door, struggling violently with a person and butting them on the head.</p>
      <p>Sentence was deferred from a previous hearing in order to obtain a criminal justice social work report.</p>
      <p>But when the case returned to court last week Pettigrew’s defence solicitor, John Gallagher, was critical of the report.</p>
      <p>He told the court: “In relation to the report I am surprised by the conclusion. There is no focus for a community-based disposal.</p>
      <p>“I do not concur with that.</p>
      <p>“The issue here is the abuse of alcohol, particularly in times of crisis.</p>
      <p>“A risk assessment has been carried out and on page five, third paragraph from the bottom of the report, it says there is a high risk of re-offending.</p>
      <p>“He does have a record that does him no credit but I can’t understand why he is being catapulted into the high risk category. He’s been in custody since June 24.</p>
      <p>“My submission is that he can be made subject to the highest tariff of a community-based disposal, given the time he’s spent in custody.</p>
      <p>“He acts impulsively while under the influence of alcohol.</p>
      <p>“He’s been working with all the resources available to him (in custody) to help address his difficulties and he’s now at a stage where he’s had time to reflect on these matters. He’s spent around five months in custody.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Desmond Leslie told Pettigrew: “I am prepared to deal with this with a non custodial sentence.”</p>
      <p>Pettigrew was sentenced to a 24-month community payback order, which involves supervision and he must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work in the community, to be completed within the next six months.</p>
      <p>Pettigrew was also made subject to a restriction of liberty order, which requires him to be within his home address between the hours of 7pm and 7am for the next four months.</p>
      <p>He was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for the next five years. A review of Pettigrew’s order will occur on February 27.</p>
