      <h3>The TrueAchievements Twelve Days of Christmas Challenge Returns for 2019</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sam+Quirke">Sam Quirke</a>, 29 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>If you've been jonesing for a new Community Challenge and another profile badge to go along with it, we've got good news – the TrueAchievements <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/event/Twelve-Days-Of-Christmas-2019">Twelve Days of Christmas Challenge</a> is returning for 2019 – and it's starting this Monday, December 2nd.</p>

      <h4>What is The Twelve Days of Christmas 2019 Community Challenge?</h4>
      <p>Each day starting from Monday, December 2nd through to Friday, December 13th, the TA Community and Events team are going to reveal a new challenge at 10:00am UTC. The mini challenges will involve unlocking certain types of achievements – for example unlocks from a certain genre, or achievements that have a certain flag or gamerscore value. Each consecutive challenge will require one more achievement to be unlocked than the last, just like the Christmas carol. You can keep track of each new daily challenge by checking the news story on the TA homepage, or by checking the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/event/Twelve-Days-Of-Christmas-2019">event hub</a> once the challenge is live.</p>
      <p>To make things a little easier, you have until the end of December to complete the full set of 12 challenges – you don't have to complete them on the day they come out. You also don't need to worry about other unrelated achievements you unlock on the way to completing a certain challenge – you won't break your challenge streak by unlocking something that doesn't meet the requirements. However, you do have to complete each challenge in order to unlock the next one – achievements won't count towards the challenge for Day 8, for example, if you have only completed up to Day 4.</p>
      <p>Once you've registered for the event you will find a panel on your homepage that will always display the current challenge you are working on. Underneath will be a link to all of the locked achievements in your Game Collection that could satisfy the current requirement.</p>
