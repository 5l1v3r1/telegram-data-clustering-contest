      <p>This year's production of Aladdin is the third production by the Mary Stevens Hospice Pantomime Company after sell-out shows of the Wizard of Oz and Cinderella in previous years.</p>
      <p>The cast includes British TV personality and actress White Dee, as the Empress of Brum.</p>
      <p>Alongside Alf Rai, who plays Genie of the Lamp in his third pantomime for the hospice.</p>
      <p>After months of hard work and hours of rehearsals, the curtain rose for the first time on Wednesday, November 27 at Stourbridge Town Hall.</p>
      <p>Cast and crew members have given up their spare time for the last six months, working tirelessly to put on a show full of laughter, song and classic pantomime humour.</p>
      <p>Amanda Bowen, deputy head of fundraising at Mary Stevens Hospice, said: "Aladdin is our third annual pantomime and we are extremely proud of it!</p>
      <p>"Our cast and crew members have all volunteered their time and services to bring this magical fairy tale to the stage in order to support patient care at Mary Stevens Hospice and we can't thank them enough.</p>
      <p>"Our community have come out in force to buy tickets to the show and if they like magic carpets, Chinese dragons, fun and laughter, they will not be disappointed, oh no they wont!"</p>
      <p>The Hospice, which is based in Stourbridge, offers specialist care for adults living with life-shortening illnesses and dedicated support for their families and carers.</p>
      <p>The pantomime is on until Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>Tickets can be purchased online at <a href="http://boroughhalls.co.uk/msh-aladdin.html">http://boroughhalls.co.uk/msh-aladdin.html</a> and a limited number of tickets will be available at the town hall box office before each show.</p>
      <p>All of the profits raised are donated towards patient care at Mary Stevens Hospice.</p>
