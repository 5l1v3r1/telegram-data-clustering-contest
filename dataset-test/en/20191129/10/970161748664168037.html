      <p>It’s not even December yet, but Gemma Collins won’t let that stop her from getting into the Christmas spirit.</p>
      <p>Celebrating the opening of a new ice rink at Eastwell Manor Champneys Health and Spa, on Thursday night, the Towie star rocked on up to the venue in a bright red Santa hat covered in sequins.</p>
      <p>And while getting everyone into the festive mood, the 38-year-old threw on her skates before braving the ice rink once again.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the TV personality appeared on ITV’s hit show Dancing On Ice where she attempted to show off her moves with her partner Matt Evers.</p>
      <p>However, despite giving it her best shot, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/27/gemma-collins-dramatic-fall-dancing-ice-branded-fake-viewers-8400481/">the GC ended up falling flat on her face not once but twice when entertaining the audience during the live shows.</a></p>

      <p>This hasn’t put her off the ice though, as she glided around the rink and was even pictured stopping for selfies with fans at last night’s event.</p>

      <p>The star is pretty much the skating pro and will be returning to the much-loved competition for their annual Christmas special.</p>
      <p>A source told The Sun Online: ‘[Gemma] wants to be the showstopper for the Christmas special, and is proving to producers she is ready for it.</p>
      <p>‘She’ll be giving a jaw-dropping performance when she returns to the rink alongside [former Dancing on Ice winners] Ray Quinn and Jake Quickenden.’</p>

      <p>She also confirmed the news, as she filmed herself skating for the first time in almost nine months.</p>
      <p>‘This the moment you’ve all been waiting for,’ she told fans on her Instagram story: ‘I’m getting this recorded because I haven’t stepped on the ice since I think March, whenever the last Dancing On Ice was, so let’s just see if my legs, which they say keeps muscle memory, works.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not nervous, I’m really excited to get on the ice.  My guards are off because I used to step on here with my guards on and nearly break my neck, so let’s just see…’</p>
      <p>However, it seems she had a blast as she confessed getting back on the ice was ‘actually really nice.’</p>

      <p>‘Oh my god I’m just warming up my legs guys wow! So this is what we always do for a warm up when we first step onto the ice,’ she expressed.</p>
      <p>‘The ice is happy I’m back! I can feel it yeah baby Dancing on Ice is coming, Christmas special, make sure you tune in to see the GC!’</p>
