      <p>If long, thin phones are your bag, you're going to love this Vodafone deal that gets you a 500GB PlayStation 4 for free.</p>
      <p>Just sign up for a <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/mobile/phones/pay-monthly-contracts/sony/xperia-5">24-month Unlimited contract for Xperia 5</a> to get the FIFA 20 500GB PS4 bundle worth £249.

      <p>The deal goes live today and is only available up until Monday, December 2, so you'll have to decide on whether you want to commit pretty sharpish.</p>
      <p>The Xperia 5 was <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/ifa-2019-sonys-xperia-5-is-here-and-it-seems-long-thin-phones-are-here-to-stay/">unveiled at IFA 2019</a> and features the 21:9 CinemaWide Display which offers more screen space.
