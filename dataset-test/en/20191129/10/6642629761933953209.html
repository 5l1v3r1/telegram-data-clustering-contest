      <p>Zuma, who was forced to resign last year over a separate corruption scandal, filed an appeal last month ahead of the initial October 15 trial date, dragging on a case that has seen numerous legal turns over a decade and a half.</p>
      <p>He is alleged to have taken bribes from French arms manufacturer Thales through his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik worth four million rand ($270,000).</p>
      <p>Zuma, 77, denies charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering related to a $3.4bn arms deal in 1999 when he was deputy president.</p>
      <p>Thales also denies the charges. ItsÂ application for permission to appeal against the trial was also thrown out at the same time as Zuma's.</p>
      <p>Both Zuma and Thales, have the option to approach the Supreme Court in their push to dodge trial, legal analyst Mphulelelo Zikalala, suggested that "the prospects of success are slim".</p>
      <h3>Lengthy delays</h3>
      <p>The former president has alleged his case was prejudiced by lengthy delays in bringing the matter to trial.</p>
      <p>Zuma said earlier this year that he had been "vilified" and subjected to "character assassination" as part of a conspiracy by opponents seeking his downfall.</p>
      <p>His lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane has denounced "political interference" in the case.</p>
      <p>The charges were first brought in 2005 but they were dropped by prosecutors in 2009, shortly before Zuma became president, and reinstated in 2016.</p>
      <p>Zuma was forced to step down last year by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party after a nine-year reign marked by corruption allegations and dwindling popularity.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/south-africa-relief-president-ramaphosa-corruption-case-190812102536996.html">Cyril Ramaphosa</a>, who took over from Zuma, has promised to tackle deep-seated corruption but faces opposition from senior powerful <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/anc.html">ANC</a> members, many of whom remain Zuma allies.</p>
