      <p>The tournament, like Euro 2016, will feature 24 teams. Twenty have already secured their places, the final four will be determined by play-off matches in March next year. There will be six groups, each containing four teams.</p>
      <p>The top two teams from each group qualify for the round of 16, with the four best third-placed teams joining them.</p>
      <h3>Who can England get?</h3>

      <p>England might quite like Poland from pot two and the Czech Republic from pot three – although the Czechs beat them in qualification. Israel are the lowest-ranked of the sides in play-off Path C.</p>
      <h3>And for Wales?</h3>
      <p>Probably to face Italy, Poland and the Czechs in Group A.</p>
      <h3>What does the path to the knockouts look like for England?</h3>
