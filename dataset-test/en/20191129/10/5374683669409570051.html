      <h2>Defense Minister says Israel has unique opportunity to force Iran out of Syria while Tehran is under pressure at home with economic woes.</h2>

      <p>Israel has the opportunity to push Iranian forces out of Syria and force Tehran to abandon its efforts to turn the war-torn country into a springboard for attacks on Israel, Defense Minister Naftali Bennett told top security officials.</p>
      <p>According to a report by <i>Israel Hayom</i> Friday morning, during a series of recent meetings with senior security officials, Defense Ministry Bennett said Israel had a “window of opportunity” to take advantage of Iran’s ongoing internal problems – notably Tehran’s economic woes and ongoing protests inside the Islamic republic – to push Iran’s Quds Force out of Syria.</p>
      <p>Bennett has, according to the report, argued that Israel must apply increased pressure on Iran militarily in Syria, but also economically and politically. He argued that Israel made a mistake in scaling back its activities against Iran in recent months.</p>
      <p>The Defense Minister said Israel must ramp up its operations against Iran significantly, and take action against any Iranian military presence in Syria and other nations in the region.</p>
      <p>Israel should increase its attacks on Iranian targets in Syria even at the risk of prompting an Iranian response, argued Bennett, adding that a sustained campaign against Iran would convince Tehran that the continued presence of its forces in Syria will not be beneficial to the regime.</p>
      <p>Over the past two weeks, hundreds of Iranian protesters have been killed by regime forces as demonstrators have taken to the streets to denounce rising fuel prices.</p>
      <p>As the death toll has risen, the protests have become increasingly political, with calls for top Iranian officials to resign.</p>
