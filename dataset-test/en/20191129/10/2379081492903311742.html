      <h1>Euro-Area Inflation Quickens, But Remains Far Below ECB's Goal</h1>

      <p>Euro-area inflation accelerated in November, offering some comfort for the European Central Bank whose monetary stimulus has attracted increased scrutiny over potentially detrimental side effects.</p>
      <p>The rate picked up to 1% from a three-year low of 0.7% in October, beating expectations for a 0.9% reading. More importantly, a measure stripping out volatile components quickened to 1.3%, the highest in seven months.</p>
      <p>The headline rate is still well below the ECB’s goal of just under 2%. Recent shifts in inflation have been driven by energy, and the central bank has warned that underlying price pressures are “muted.”</p>
      <p>The ECB has been struggling to lift inflation despite years of ultra-loose policy. The latest stimulus salvo included cutting interest rates further below zero and a fresh round of quantitative easing that’s set to continue until inflation is firmly tethered to its goal.</p>
      <p>But the high degree of monetary support is attracting increasingly intense criticism. Sub-zero rates have riled German savers and raised the specter of pension cuts in the Netherlands. Banks across the euro area are also blaming the policy for their poor profitability.</p>
      <p>In its latest Financial Stability Review, even the ECB warned of potential side effects, including threats to investment funds, insurers and in some real estate markets.</p>
      <p>The ECB is likely to take stock of its experience when it starts a strategy review early next year under new president Christine Lagarde. Policy makers expect to tweak their inflation target — fixing it at 2%, but will struggle to go much further than that, according to officials with knowledge of the matter.</p>
      <p>Separately, the Eurostat said on Friday that euro-area unemployment dropped to 7.5% in October, the lowest since July 2008. Yet regional differences remain significant. While in Germany, only 3.1% of the working population remained without a job, the figure stood at 16.7% in Greece and 14.2% in Spain.</p>
