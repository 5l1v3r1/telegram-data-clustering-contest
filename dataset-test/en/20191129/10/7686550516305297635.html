      <p>Neil Harris believes he has 'too big of a squad' at Cardiff City and will be forced into wielding the axe if he is to sign any new players in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The new Bluebirds boss was cautious when discussing any plans to recruit in January, given he has been in the job less than two weeks, but has taken note of the bloated squad at his disposal in the Welsh capital.</p>
      <p>He highlighted the fact that this weekend he could potentially have four strikers at his disposal. Contrast that with how thin the Bluebirds look in the wing-back positions at present, for example, and there is a definite imbalance.</p>
      <p>So if he is to strengthen in key areas in the New Year, Harris has said that some players will have to leave the club.</p>
      <p>“As a football fan myself following various teams I know how fans think, you start piecing plans together ‘well he’s not played, he has played, is he going to go, is he going to stay’ it is far too early for all of that," Harris said.</p>
      <p>“But it’s what I am doing, I am sitting there thinking ‘well I’ve not used him.’ But it is nothing like that at the moment, everyone is getting an opportunity, because until you get everybody on the pitch, you just don’t know about them.</p>
      <p>“It is too early to make judgements about January but what I do know is it is a big squad and before we bring anyone in, players will have to leave.</p>
      <p>“We are getting better all the time, the players out are getting closer, it is getting to the stage where it is tough to put on XI v XI because of the amount of bodies we’ve got, in some ways it is too many, it is too big a squad.</p>
      <p>“We work with it until January and then we start it there."</p>
      <p>Harris has spoken well about his plans for the academy since his arrival in South Wales and Friday morning was no different.</p>
      <p>Following the departure of Andy Legg last week, the City boss said he wants to have an input in who succeeds him as under-23s manager.</p>
      <p>He believes this is a vital area of the club and is hellbent on nurturing a closer connection between the senior team and the youth system.</p>
      <p>He highlighted again, however, that the squad size at present might represent a hindrance to the emerging talent at the club.</p>
      <p>“I want to work with the next under-23s manager very, very closely.</p>
      <p>“We want a free-flowing relationship between the academy and the first team.</p>
      <p>“The club is crying out for opportunities for the youngsters to come through. It’s not going to be overnight because of the size of the first-team squad.</p>
      <p>“But over the course of the next six to 12 months I want to see that pathway develop… the club and the fans want to see that as well. If they are good enough they will get the chance to play.”</p>
