      <p>The internet is BOOMING with students carrying out their ‚Äòend of SPM celebrations‚Äô. Students screamed, drew on each other‚Äôs uniforms, caused traffic jams, and although some of them were a little cringy, we can‚Äôt overlook the more touching celebrations that came out of this year‚Äôs examinations.</p>
      <p>Like this picture of SPM students in jail who prostrated themselves after the exam shared by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/harianmetro/photos/pb.211591442051.-2207520000.0./10157982522522052/?type=3&amp;theater">Harian Metro</a> that melted the hearts of those who saw it.</p>

      <p>With such a powerful picture, a very simple but highly important question sparked in our minds; how do people in jail take their SPM exams?</p>
      <p>This Twitter user, <a href="https://twitter.com/qyscha_/status/1199705330772406273">@qyscha_</a>, thought the same too and decided to ask wise and knowledgeable netizens to quench our thirst for information.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúCan someone do a thread on how people in jail take SPM?</p>
      <p>When would they study and how they were taught, what are the qualifications to take SPM.‚Äù</p>

      <p>According to one of the post commenters, <a href="https://twitter.com/qyscha_/status/1199705330772406273">@AHrzth</a>, this is how they are educated;</p>
      <p>First of all, there are differences between inmates that take SPM in jail and Henry Gurney Schools (SHG).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Inmates in Prison:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Managed according to the Jail Act 1995.</li>
        <li>Those that are around the age of 18-21 will be considered as a ‚Äòyoung prisoner‚Äô.</li>
        <li>Will still be allowed to take SPM as long as they are older than 17-years-old.</li>
        <li>Required to follow the Academic Education Module in Self Development Program (PPi)</li>
        <li>
          <p>Placed in an Integrity School (SI).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SI Puncak Alam</li>
            <li>SI Kluang</li>
            <li>SI Marang</li>
            <li>SI Muar</li>
            <li>SI Sg.Petani</li>
            <li>SI Kota Kinabalu</li>
            <li>SI Puncak Borneo</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Inmates in SHG:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Managed according to the Child Act 2001 and the Henry Gurney School Module 1949</li>
        <li>Consist of those with the range age of 14 ‚Äì 18 years old</li>
        <li>
          <p>Currently, there are 5 Henry Gurney schools in Malaysia;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SHG Telok Mas, Melaka</li>
            <li>SHG Kota Kinabalu, Sabah</li>
            <li>SHG Keningau, Sabah</li>
            <li>SHG Puncak Borneo, Sarawak</li>
            <li>SHG Wanita, Batu Gajah, Perak</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are 3 core classes that exist in these schools; 3M class (reading, counting, writing), Pre-SPM class and SPM. To make things fair, the syllabus used will be exactly the same as the one we use in national schools.</p>
      <p>The schools will also operate at the same time as daily schools accept that they only have a morning session. The classes start as early as 7am, after the Prison Manager does the muster body count.</p>
      <p>As admitted by one of the ex-inmates from the Henry Gurney School, learning there is actually enjoyable.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúLearning there was nice but because it‚Äôs ‚Äòthere‚Äô makes it less nice. If you are wondering why they don‚Äôt include the school‚Äôs name in the certificate, it is because the students are registered as private candidates, and they don‚Äôt want companies to be scared when they see our school‚Äôs name.‚Äù</p>

      <p>As explained in the thread, education for inmates doesn‚Äôt only stop at SPM. For those who are eligible and interested to continue their studies, they can learn up to the PhD level in the Higher Education Module at either Kajang Prison or Bentong Prison only, according to an agreement together with the Open University of Malaysia.</p>
      <p>However, all of the fees will be covered by their families, as the prison will only provide them with the proper facilities.</p>
