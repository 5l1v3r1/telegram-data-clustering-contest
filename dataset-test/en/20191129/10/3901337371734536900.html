      <p>Ernst Middendorp thinks that to really appreciate Kaizer Chiefs’ form this season, you have to look back at where they were at the end of last season…</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys are flying high in the Absa Premiership at present, and with 12 games played are 10 points clear at the top of the league table, and already just eight points away from equalling their points tally from their 2018/19 campaign.</p>
      <p>Middendorp, who has been largely credited with their turnaround, says that it is completely a team effort that has led to their success, and therefore refused to take full credit as he was given the Coach of the Month award for September and October by the Premier Soccer League.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his award this week, as quoted by the club’s official website, the German said, “Everybody working with the team is a recipient of this award. My technical and coaching staff, all the other support staff and the players, everybody has had a role to play in our success and this is recognition to all of them and the club as a whole.</p>
      <p>“I think we have to look back and see where we were a few months ago. We ended last season in ninth place and what we have achieved since then is phenomenal. We brought in new players, had players return from injury and everyone has done very well. That is why we as a team are receiving this recognition.”</p>

      <p>Middendorp now has a bit of time to work with his players as they look to make it eight games in a row against Bloemfontein Celtic, with that game only being played on December 7.  </p>
