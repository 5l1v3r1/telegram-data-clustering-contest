      <h1>Hours at Arsenal before Emery was sacked</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:40:10+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author">Bowale Odutola</a></address>
      <p>A number of senior figures behind the scenes at Arsenal are reportedly due to hold a “crisis meeting” over the future of Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>While Arsenal’s form in the Premier League has come under intense scrutiny, their 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League has heaped further pressure on the Gunners boss.</p>
      <p>With the north Londoners having failed to win any of their last seven matches in all competitions, Sky Sports News suggests that the 48-year-old is on the brink of an exit from the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>The report claimed that a meeting will be held on Friday morning to discuss whether Emery should be removed from his position with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>As the final whistle went on Thursday evening, the club’s home ground are almost empty, while banners calling for the departure of Emery had been displayed throughout the match.</p>
      <p>Arsenal must now decide whether to part company with Emery or allow him one final chance to get his team back on track at Norwich City on Sunday afternoon.</p>
