      <h1>Sudan repeals Omar al-Bashir-era law regulating women's behaviour and dissolves former ruling party</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:03:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/agence-france-presse/" target="_blank">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>Sudan's new authorities on Thursday ordered that the party of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/19/ousted-sudan-dictator-omar-al-bashir-got-90-million-saudi-royals/">ousted autocrat Omar al-Bashir</a> be dissolved and his regime "dismantled", heeding the call of protesters whose campaign led to the leader's overthrow.</p>
      <p>Bashir and his Islamist National Congress Party (NCP) had ruled the northeast African country since 1989 before a nationwide protest movement resulted in him being deposed earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The country's <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/06/china-launches-sudans-first-satellite-highlighting-strong-links/">new ruling sovereign council</a> and the cabinet led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok made the decision to dissolve the party, approving a law titled "Dismantling of the regime of 30th June 1989".</p>
      <p>"The National Congress Party is dissolved and its registration is cancelled from the list of political parties in Sudan," the decree said, adding that a committee would be formed to confiscate all its properties and assets.</p>
      <p>"None of the symbols of the regime or party would be allowed to engage in any political activity for 10 years".</p>
      <p>The dissolution of the party was "not a revenge" against the country's former rulers, Hamdok wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"But it aims to preserve the dignity of Sudanese people which was crushed by dishonest people.</p>
      <p>"This law aims to recover the plundered wealth of the people."</p>

      <p>Wajdi Salah, a spokesman of the umbrella protest movement Forces of Freedom and Change, said on his Facebook page that the old regime party would be dismantled completely.</p>
      <p>The Sudanese Professionals Association, the protest group that had initially led the demonstrations against Bashir, praised the decision to dismantle the former regime.</p>
      <p>"It is a major step towards achieving the goal of the revolution and on the path of building a democratic civilian state," the SPA said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Thousands of Sudanese rallied late last month in several cities, urging the new authorities to dissolve the former ruling party.</p>
      <p>Bashir and the NCP had ruled Sudan with an iron fist since he seized power in 1989 by overthrowing the elected government of prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the sovereign council and the cabinet also formally scrapped the controversial public-order law that had severely curtailed women's rights in the country during Bashir's rule.</p>
      <p>Thousands of women were flogged, fined and even jailed under the archaic law that activists said primarily targeted women through harsh interpretations of Islamic sharia law.</p>
      <p>Under the law those who consumed or brewed alcohol - banned in the country - were punished, while activists said security forces used the law to arrest women for attending private parties or wearing trousers.</p>
      <p>The controversial law had led to simmering anger among women for decades.</p>
      <p>Women were at the forefront of the demonstrations that erupted in December 2018 against Bashir.</p>
      <p>The protests quickly turned into a nationwide anti-regime movement that finally led to his ouster.</p>
      <p>The army deposed him on April 11 in a palace coup, and in August a joint civilian and military sovereign council was formed to oversee the country's transition to civilian rule as demanded by protesters.</p>
      <p>A civilian-led cabinet headed by Hamdok is charged with the day-to-day running of the country.</p>
      <p>Bashir is being held in a prison in Khartoum facing trial on charges of corruption. Several other officials of his government and senior party members are also in jail.</p>
