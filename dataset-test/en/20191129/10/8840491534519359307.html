      <p>MINISTER Michael Ring has approved €100,000 to be invested in the enhancement of five walking trails in Mayo under his department’s Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.</p>
      <p>The scheme provides funding for the development and maintenance of outdoor amenities such as trails, walkways, cycleways and blueways.</p>
      <p>The Mayo trails receiving funding are:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Táin Bó Fliodhaise - Cattle Raid of Mayo Trail (€20,000): To carry out improvements to the existing Turas na Gaeltachta - Táin Bó Fliodhaise sites at Munhin, Glencastle and Ceathrú Thaidhg. Also to develop specific branding and studies for developments on the wider Táin Bó Fliodhaise project.</p>
      <p>Killeen walks (€20,000): The Killeen walks offers two looped walking trails ranging in distance of 6.5 km and 7.2 km, with a mix of terrain to include country lanes and tracks. The trails are strategically located along the Wild Atlantic Way. The funding is for the design of a pedestrian footbridge along the route. The work will involve site investigations and to engage with structural engineers for a specialised design for a new footbridge.</p>
      <p>Pullathomas Loop Walk (€20,000): This 7 km walking trail extends around the village of Pullathomas. It is strategically located along the Wild Atlantic Way and offers spectacular views of north Mayo in this Gaeltacht area. The plan is to carry out improvements and much needed upgrade work to a section of the track and to the trailhead, and to install directional signage.</p>
      <p>Brackloon Woods - new access (€20,000): Brackloon Woods is located 6 km from Westport, just off the Leenane Road. The funding will support the development of a new access/entry point into the woods. This will also act as an access point to both the Western Way and the Croagh Patrick Heritage Trail, both of which traverse through the grounds of Brackloon Woods. New directional signage will also be installed.</p>
      <p>Nephin Trailhead, Lahardane (€20,000): To develop a carpark and information area at the start of the new low level walk which has recently been developed at the foothills of Nephin forest ground. The plans are to surface dress the existing carpark area along with the provision of fencing, seating and an information area. This was a collaboration project between the local community group, Coillte and Mayo County Council. The walk has become hugely popular with locals and with other users/hikers looking to hike to the summit of Nephin.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Prior to today’s allocation, Minister Ring has allocated more than €2.6 million in the last two years to walking and cycling trails in Mayo through the scheme.</p>
      <p>Making the announcement today, Minister Ring said: “I am delighted to announce funding today of €100,000 for five trails in our county. This funding will make a huge difference to the ongoing maintenance and development of the outdoor recreation facilities that are being supported.”</p>
