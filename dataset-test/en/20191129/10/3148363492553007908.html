      <h2>Four men appeared in a UK court this week, charged for their alleged roles in a series of gun and machete attacks in Manchester.</h2>

      <p>Four men Mark Fellows, Aaron Parkin​​, Liam Gee, and Warren Barnes, have been charged in connection with attacks in February and March 2015 in Greater Manchester.</p>
      <p>The first attack is said to have taken place on February 18, 2015, when gunshots were fired at a car with three people inside of it. One man, Abdul Rahman Khan, was injured during the shooting, before fleeing the scene, later being hospitalised, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/four-men-appear-court-over-17322686">according</a> to the <i>Manchester Evening News.</i></p>
      <p>The second incident reportedly happened on March 21, 2015, when Aaron Williams was brutally attacked with a machete, leaving him critically injured.</p>
      <p>All four defendants have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder, arrested after a “long-running investigation” looking into violence in Greater Manchester, police <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-50563144">told</a> the <i>BBC</i>.</p>
      <p>The alleged attacks come as part of a developing trend of violent crime in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Last year Breitbart News reported that machete attacks had increased by nearly <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/04/15/machete-attack-every-90-minutes-gun-free-britain/">500 per cent</a> over the prior three years, with most attacks occurring in the capital city of London, where fatal teen stabbings have reached a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/25/khans-london-teen-stabbings-reach-decade-high/">decade high</a>.</p>
      <p>The United Kingdom, which has strict gun-control laws has seen a surge of knife crime, particularly in London. Machetes, designed for cutting through the undergrowth in rainforests, has increasingly become a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tag/machete-attack/">weapon of choice</a> for violent criminals across the country.</p>
