      <h1>Manchester United send Tahith Chong a message over contract offer</h1>
      <h2>Tahith Chong made his first appearance for Man United in nearly two months at Astana and has just seven months left on his contract.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Luckhurst, http://www.facebook.com/samuelluckhurstjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Tahith Chong must decide if he wants to re-sign for <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> after the club submitted their contract offer.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer revealed earlier this month United are in discussions with <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tahith-chong">Chong</a> and Angel Gomes, both 19, as they approach the final seven months on their existing deals.</p>
      <p>Both returned to the starting XI in the Europa League defeat to Astana, where Chong wasted an easy chance with United 1-0 up on the hour mark before Astana scored twice in quick succession.</p>
      <p>Chong was the first player to be substituted but accepted responsibility for his mistake in the dressing room afterwards and Solskjaer was asked about the Dutchman's contract situation.</p>
      <p>"There are players we wanna get signed, of course," Solskjaer said. "And Tahith is a player we think is gonna develop, we've offered him a very good contract and the ball is in his court."</p>
      <p>Chong joined United from Feyenoord in 2016 and made his debut off the bench against Reading in the FA Cup third round in January. The Netherlands Under-21 international has already featured on the last two pre-season tours but recently claimed he was in no rush to commit to United.</p>
      <p>"It's early right now," Chong said. "I'm still a player of Manchester United and the season is in full swing. My focus is on that.Â The contract will come naturally. I am now focusing on this season."</p>
      <p>Solskjaer explained four weeks ago: "We've had lots of conversations with the boys. Obviously their contracts run out in the summer but we want them to stay.</p>
      <p>"I can't see a better place for a young lad that's come through the ranks in the academy to play first team football. Both Angel and Chongy have been here for many, many years.</p>
      <p>"We just want them to continue their development and hopefully they can see that when young lads take their chance, they'll get more opportunities."</p>
