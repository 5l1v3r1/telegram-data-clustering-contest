      <p>Mr Geater was a founder member of the council in 1973, representing his home town Leiston as a Conservative councillor. He chaired the council in 1985/6. He remained on the authority until 2011 apart from the four-year period from 1995-99 when the Tories lost power.</p>
      <p>He was born in Leiston and the town was his home for most of his life.</p>
      <p>He and his family ran a smallholding for many years producing fruit and he had a major egg production plant.</p>
      <p>Mr Geater was also a teacher at Kesgrave before moving to Leiston Grammar School, and then Leiston High School.</p>
      <p>He and his wife June were about to celebrate their 67th wedding anniversary when he died.</p>
      <p>His daughter Susan, who followed him on to the council for its last years, said: "He had a good, long, happy life. Looking back we had a very happy family life as we grew up."</p>
      <p>After retiring from teaching Mr and Mrs Geater loved travelling - especially on cruises - and they continued to visit all parts of the world until recently.</p>
      <p>He went into hospital in early November for treatment but suffered a stroke and died last week.</p>
      <p>Susan Geater said: "The staff at the hospital were wonderful. They could not have done any more to make him comfortable."</p>
      <p>Mr Geater leaves his widow, two daughters, and a son. His elder son, David, died last year. He also leaves six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Former Suffolk Coastal council leader Ray Herring said: "John Geater was one of the original Suffolk Coastal District councillors first elected following the 1974 local government reorganisation.</p>
      <p>"As an experienced and respected Councillor over 33 years and a past Chairman, John was instrumental in guiding the early development of Felixstowe Port and the port health service.</p>
      <p>"He was always an enthusiastic supporter of Nuclear power and could see the benefits of Sizewell B to the Leiston area economy and employment particularly following the demise of the Garrett Works. John's zeal and compassion for everything Leiston will be greatly missed by the local community."</p>
