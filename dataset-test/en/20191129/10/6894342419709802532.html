      <h1>The Tesla Cybertruck Is Right At Home In GoldenEye 007 On The Nintendo 64</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:15:35+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>Elon Musk’s Tesla Cybertruck is clearly inspired by sci-fi retro-futuresque designs usually featured in 80s pop culture – but to gamers, it nostalgically reminded them of low polygonal vehicle models found in video games from the PlayStation 1 and Nintendo 64 era. In regards to the latter, someone actually made an effort to mod the Cybertruck into the 1997 Nintendo 64 classic, GoldenEye 007.</p>
      <p>The mod and its in-game representation of the Cybertruck was created by Youtuber Graslu00, and was placed in the game’s “Streets” level where the player is required to commandeer a tank. Yes, Graslu00 replaced the tank with the Tesla Cybertruck and even added an in-game Elon Musk who’ll present the vehicle to you.</p>

      <p>While the low-poly version of Elon Musk looks remotely close to his real-life counterpart, not the same can be said for the GoldenEye version of his electric truck. The Cybertruck’s unspectacular boxy, trapezium-shaped body looked like it belonged in the game’s world. It clearly shows that you don’t necessarily need high-end graphics to cross the uncanny valley. Well, for the Cybertruck at least.</p>
      <p>After a brief chat with Musk, the player is then allowed to take the truck out for an in-game “test drive”, and even try out its Bond-exclusive feature: a built-in tank cannon. Sure, we won’t be seeing such a thing in the real Cybertruck, but hey… at least its <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/200188/tesla-cybertruck-orders-reaches-200000/">bullet-proof glass</a> worked perfectly fine in the game.</p>

      <p>Jokes aside, the Tesla Cybertruck has managed to rake in pre-orders of over 250,000 units since its reveal, and is expected to ship in 2021 onwards. On the other hand, the GoldenEye 007 Cybertruck mod was made by the author to be featured on his Youtube channel, and is not planned for an actual release.</p>
