      <p>ARSENAL HAVE OFFICIALLY parted company with manager Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The decision comes on the back of last night’s Europa League game at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, which saw the Gunners relinquish a first-half lead en route to a 2-1 defeat.</p>
      <p>The North London club, who currently sit in eighth place in the Premier League table, are without a win in their last seven games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>“The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required,” reads a statement released this morning by Arsenal.</p>
      <p>While the search for a successor to Emery proceeds, former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg — who had already been a member of the first-team coaching ticket — will take interim charge of the side ahead of Sunday’s game against Norwich City.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the Arsenal board and owners, Josh Kroenke said: “Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand. We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success.”</p>
      <p>Emery was appointed Arsenal manager in the summer of 2018. The 48-year-old Spaniard replaced Arsene Wenger, who departed after a 22-year tenure.</p>
