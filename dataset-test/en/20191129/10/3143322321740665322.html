      <h1>Blue Moon rises to rock the Lowveld</h1>
      <h2>Neither rain, nor a fallen tree, could deter diehard rock fans from WoodCrock at Blue Moon last Saturday evening.</h2>

      <p>MBOMBELA – The line-up started with an early show by the White River Swamp Rats in the afternoon, and once the storm had settled down and the power had regained stability, the evening line-up resumed.</p>
      <p>I Believe in Giants and The Color Blew played some of their original songs and did great rock renditions of popular songs: “Little Lion Man” by Mumford and Sons and “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen.</p>

      <p>The main event for the evening was The Narrow, which had everyone jumping and moshing on the dance floor. The international alternative rock band is best known for its song “Lonely Lonely”.</p>

      <p>The Narrow was followed by Son of Hawk, Backstage and DJ Dirtroad.</p>
      <p>The event was a nostalgic success. Anyone who has been to Blue Moon can attest to the good times and rock ‘n’ roll that live within the boundaries of the venue.</p>
      <blockquote>“The rain was a welcome surprise, but did not stop us,” Margaret Adams, WoodCrock organiser, said. “Our goal is to get Blue Moon to rise again, and everyone who was there, did that. Blue Moon is rising!”</blockquote>
