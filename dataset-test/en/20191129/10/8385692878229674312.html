      <p>Another pair of <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/sony">Sony</a> wireless earphones are now on sale for Black Friday. The Sony WF-SP700N wireless earphones are <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounted</a> to $148 as we speak.</p>
      <p>These earphones usually cost $179.99, which means you can save $31.99 if you take advantage of this deal. In other words, you'll be saving 18-percent.</p>
      <p>This deal is available via Amazon, in case you were wondering. These earphones are available in five color variants on Amazon, and four of them are discounted. The Sony WF-SP700N earphones are discounted in Black, Blue, White, and White iterations. The 'Royal' aka yellow color option costs $199.75.</p>

      <p>These are not the smallest wireless earphones out there, not at all. These are actually mean to be used for workout sessions, and are sweatproof. Sony actually markets these as sports earphones.</p>
      <p>These earphones deliver extra bass, and are compatible with both iOS and Android. You can sync using your Bluetooth connection and NFC.</p>
      <p>These earphones offer digital noise-canceling, and are IPX4 rated. That means that they're not only sweatproof, but also splashproof. They can handle some rain without a problem, so they're ideal for outdoor running sessions.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The company claims that these earphones can deliver up to 9 hours of audio playback before you'll need to charge them. No matter how much you like exercising, you probably won't be doing it for 9 hours straight.</p>
      <p>You can make calls using these earphones, as they do come with a microphone. That is more or less it.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in getting these earphones, you may want to hurry, as the deal won't be available for long. You can purchase them from Amazon by hitting <a href="https://geni.us/MkgHjX">this link</a>, or tapping the purchase button down below. When you get to their listing on Amazon, make sure to select what color you'd like to purchase, as the black ones are selected by default.</p>
