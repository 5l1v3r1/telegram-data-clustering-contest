      <h1>'Lot of domestic coaching talent': Dravid</h1>
      <h2>Rahul Dravid said that he feels IPL teams 'miss a trick' by not using Indian coaches in the league and that they know and understand the Indian players better</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:06:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Batting great Rahul Dravid is disappointed at the lack of opportunities for Indian coaches in the IPL and feels the franchises are "missing a trick" by not involving them in their support staff.</p>
      <p>According to the former captain and the current National Cricket Academy (NCA) director, most of the Indian coaches were as good as any in the world.</p>
      <p>"I believe we've got some very good coaches, a lot of good people. I'm fully confident (in their ability). Just as we have a lot of talent in the cricket department, we have a lot of talent in the coaching department," Dravid was quoted as saying by 'ESPNcricinfo'.</p>
      <p>"We need to give them confidence and time to flourish. I'm sure they will do it. It does sometimes disappoint me when a lot of our boys don't get opportunities as assistant coaches in IPL.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, there are so many Indian players in the IPL, there's so much of local knowledge (among our coaches). I feel a lot of teams could actually benefit from using a lot of our Indian coaches in the IPL. They know the Indian players better, they understand them better."</p>
      <p>"I think a lot of IPL teams miss a trick by not using more domestic talent in the coaching area and the talent identification area, even if it is as assistants. That's my personal opinion.</p>
      <p>"It's not for me to decide for franchises and head coaches what they do, but I think they miss a trick by not involving more Indian coaches.</p>
      <p>"Indian coaches understand and know the system, and they know a lot of Indian players. Every IPL team has at least 17-18 Indian players. It's my personal view, but I would love to see a lot of our boys get the opportunity to be in and around that environment. Hopefully we can work with some teams to try and ensure that."</p>
