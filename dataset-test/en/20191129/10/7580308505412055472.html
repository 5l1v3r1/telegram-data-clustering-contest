      <p>Former chairman, Senate committee on local and foreign debt in the senate, Senator Shehu Sani has explained why the request by Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari to borrow $30 billion was turned down by the 8th Senate.</p>
      <p>“We turned down the FG loan request for 30 Billion to save Nigeria from sinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap. We don’t want our country to be recolonized by creditor banks,” Sani said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Our external debt in 2015 was $10.32 Billion and it escalated to $22.08 in the second quarter this year, which is 114 per cent, if we had approved that loan request, our external debt could have catapulted to over $52 Billion and that is not sustainable.”</p>
      <p>He cautioned that With the current escalation of borrowing, “Nigeria will walking into debt Slavery and move from landlords to tenants in our country.</p>
      <p>“They will always tell you that even America is borrowing and I don’t know how rational is it to keep on borrowing because Another country is borrowing.</p>
      <p>“If we keep listening to Bankers and contractors we will keep borrowing and burying ourselves and leave behind for our children a legacy of debt burden.</p>
      <p>“Loans are not charities. Most of those encouraging more borrowing are parasitic consultants, Commission agents, rent-seeking fronts and contractors.”</p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday requested the Senate to reconsider approving the federal government’s 2016 to 2018 external <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-seeks-fresh-senate-approval-for-external-borrowing-plan-rejected-by-8th-nass/">borrowing plan rejected by the 8th Senate under Bukola Saraki</a>‘s leadership.</p>
