          <b>Eurozone Prelim CPI rises to 1.0% in Nov vs. +0.7% last.</b>

          <b>EUR/USD stays unfazed above 1.1000</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to Eurostat’s flash reading of <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Eurozone CPI report</a>, the annual reading came in at +1.0% in November, beating expectations of +0.9% and up from +0.7% previous.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the core figure arrived at +1.3% in the reported month when compared to +1.2% expectations and +1.1% previous.</p>
      <p>Separately, the Eurozone Unemployment Rate for October stood at 7.5% vs. 7.5% expected and 7.5% last.</p>
      <h3>Key Details (via Eurostat):</h3>
      <p>“Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in November (2.0%, compared with 1.5% in October), followed by services (1.9%, compared with 1.5% in October), non-energy industrial goods (0.4%, compared with 0.3% in October) and energy (-3.2%, compared with -3.1% in October).”</p>
      <p>The Eurozone inflation report comes a day after the German Prelim CPI data was released, which showed that the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/germany-annual-cpi-drops-to-13-in-march-vs-16-expected-201903281304"><b>German consumer price inflation</b></a> accelerated by 1.2% YoY but remained well below the European Central Bank’s (ECB) rate target of just under 2 percent for the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/country/c9822cb1-6cee-45f4-a9a2-89d136990308">Eurozone</a> as a whole.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the common currency ignored the better-than-expected Eurozone CPI report for November, with EUR/USD keeping its range play intact just ahead of the 1.10 handle, as the bears await fresh catalysts for a fresh leg towards 1.0950/30 levels.</p>
