        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 29 – Four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah will defend his 10,000m title at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Great Britain’s Farah, 36, quit track events in 2017 to concentrate on the marathon.</p>
      <p>But having won gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, he has decided to return to where he has been most successful.</p>
      <p>“Next year, I’m going to be back on the track and I’m going to give it a go in the 10,000m,” he said on social media.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I haven’t lost my speed but I will train hard for it and see what I can do. I’m really excited.”</p>
      <p>Farah, who is also a six-time world champion and has yet to run the marathon at a major championship, hinted earlier in the year that he could make the switch because he “missed” the frequency that track racing provided.</p>
      <p>He finished eighth in the Chicago Marathon in October, having won it in 2018 in only his third race.</p>
      <p>Farah, who will still need to qualify for the Tokyo Games, added: “It’s been really exciting competing in the marathon over the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>“To win the Chicago Marathon was nice and to finish third in the London Marathon was OK, and it’s been a great learning curve for me.”</p>
      <p>Farah’s track return also comes at a time when he has faced questions about his association with former coach Alberto Salazar, who has been banned for four years for doping violations.</p>
      <p>Speaking before the Chicago Marathon, Farah said he had “not done anything wrong” and said there was an “agenda” against him.</p>
