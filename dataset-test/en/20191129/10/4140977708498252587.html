            </p>
            <p>When these two sides had last squared off against each other a week back, the discourse which was documented was one which heavily touted Melborune Renegades to not only win the match but ease their way to a win comprehensively. Such is the form the two sides find themselves in, in the ongoing edition of the Women’s Big Bash League, one where Melbourne Stars find themselves slumped in the bottom of the league standings.<anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137"/></p>
            <p>However, if that match taught us anything, it was the fact that matches between fierce competitors can never be undermined. Melbourne Stars paid testament to that narrative with a sunning win over Melbourne Renegades, one which was only their second win in the league, a result which did massive damage to Melbourne Renegades’ chances of making it into the ensuing round.</p>

                  <p>Normal service did resume for both the sides proceeding that contest with Melbourne Stars falling to their 10th defeat in 12 encounters as they were defeated by 18 runs by Sydney Thunder in a match where they faltered in their pursuit of 162. Elsewhere, Melbourne Renegades managed to infuse fresh life into their aspirations of making it into the next stage with a profound win over Brisbane Heat.</p>
                  <p>Needing to navigate their way past an extremely dicey target of 184, the side imbedded in place the pinch perfect run chase to cruise their way to a 6 wicket win with an over to spare. With the league stage encounters coming to a culmination, the side will be looking to not only resonate that performance but also avenge their last defeat at the hands of Melbourne Stars, a rhetoric which will add the extra bit of impetuous to the side today.</p>

                        <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                        <p>This has conventionally being a safe wicket for the bats and today is set to be no different as well with the ball coming onto the bat nicely to allow the batters to cream it to the fence with ease. The team winning the toss is set to come out and opt to set a target over here with the wicket tending to act sluggish as the encounter runs down its course.</p>

                              <h3>MRW Vs MSW Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                              <p>With all the available bats over here coming way too down in the batting order for their sides, Melbourne Stars’ Josie Dooley holds the best value for us. With her side always vulnerable to collapsing and losing its way out in the middle, she’s someone who is bound to get atleast some overs in the middle to see us go in for her for this contest.</p>
                              <h3>MRW Vs MSW Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                              <p>The 55 runs Mignon du Preez scored the last time around was once again the only beacon of light shone on an otherwise horrendous batting effort for the side. It’s not the first time the South African has waged a lone battle for her side though with the player showing her acumen all across the course of the series to keep thwarting oppositions and trying her best to rescue her side from their horrendous showings.</p>
                              <p>Lizelle Lee has partnered her perfectly till now to see her come in as well for this contest alongside Elyse Villani who scored 43 runs in the opening slot for the side in the previous contest. From Melbourne Renegades meanwhile we are opting for a duo, one which comprises of Jess Duffin who smashed an unbeaten 50 runs in the previous encounter, a knock which turned out to be a match winning effort as she took her side past the finishing line.</p>
                              <p>Tammy Beaumont came up with 23 runs in the same match to see her complete the partnership from the unit for this one.</p>
                              <h3>MRW Vs MSW Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                              <p>If it wasn’t for her 87 runs in a mere 55 balls in the forgone contest, Melbourne Reneges would have found it improbable to ease their way to a win, a knock which exulted the fight and character prevelant in Danielle Wyatt to make her an instant selection for the clash. From the other side of the slot meanwhile we have picked out Erin Osborne after her unbeaten knock of 27 was accompanied by the one wicket with the ball as well.</p>
                              <h3>MRW Vs MSW Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                              <p>Although only Maitlan Brown got a wicket for her side apart from Wyatt, we have still reposed faith in ter bowlers for this one. It’s majorly down due to the identity of their opponent, a side which is composed of a paper thin batting unit, one which can be easily perturbed by peppering it with wicket to wicket line and length. </p>
                              <p>It sees u get in a barrage of players from Melbourne Renegades for this encounter with us moving in for Maitlan Brown, Georgia Wareham and Lea Tahuhu for this match.</p>
                              <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                              <p>Wyatt continues to retain her place as our unit’s captain while Erin is our vice-captain.</p>
