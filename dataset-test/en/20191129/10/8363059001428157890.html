      <h1>You Can Buy a Lifetime Membership to Pornhub Premium Today Thanks To Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:10:08+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Pornhub is great for porn, because you can access a huge database of porn without having to sign up or pay for access, but that doesn't mean everything is so freely accessible. Some people may have noticed that there are videos and features locked away behind a subscription, which costs between £8 and £10 a month. But what if you could pay a bunch of money in one go and access Pornhub Premium for the rest of your life?</p>
      <p>From today, porn-lovers will be able to do just that, with something <a href="http://www.pornhub.com/lifeplan">called 'LifePlan'.</a> It's available to purchase between 29th November and 2nd December, and anyone can pay a one-time fee of £299 (the equivalent of 37 months' worth) and purchase themselves lifetime access to Pornhub Premium. That'll be the lifetime of Pornhub Premium, mind, not necessarily your lifetime.</p>

      <p>The perks of Pornhub Premium include not having to see any ads, access to 125,000 premium videos, faster streaming, and access to full videos in VR, 1080p, and 4K.</p>
      <p>Corey price, VP of Pornhub, said:</p>
      <blockquote> “Every year for Black Friday – which is typically the busiest shopping day of the year – we’re inundated with doorbuster deals for electronics, clothes and more. While you’re stocking up on traditional gifts, make sure you treat those you love most with the gift they really want and need.<br/><br/>What’s hotter than a freshly fried latke and better than cuddling up to your yuletide cutie by the fire? A lifetime membership to Pornhub Premium. Bring some cheer this holiday season and give the gift that keeps on giving.”</blockquote>
      <p>If a lifetime supply of Pornhub is too much for you to handle, you can also take advantage of<a href="http://www.pornhub.com/lifeplan"> other offers</a> like getting 16 months of Premium for the price of 12, as well as a 15% discount on all videos purchased through Modelhub - Pornhub's marketplace for adult stars to sell directly to customers. The company will be making up the difference as well, so the models themselves don't lose out.</p>
