      <p>YSR Congress MP Vanga Geetha, the other day, in the Lok Sabha questioned Lok Sabha Secretariat about the Special Status to Andhra Pradesh. The Answer came as a huge embarrassment for the Ruling Party in Andhra Pradesh. It has also become a weapon in the hand of Opposition now.</p>
      <p>The Reply said there is no request or query from Andhra Pradesh Government regarding the Special Status after May 2019. YS Jagan Mohan Reddy took oath on May 30th and this means Jaganâ€™s Government did not put forth a Single Request for the Special Status after coming to Power.</p>
      <p>We all know how <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/despite-criticism-andhra-pradesh-govt-continues-to-fund-jagans-personal-properties/">Jagan Mohan Redd</a>y used to criticize Chandrababu Naidu for not bringing the Special Status. He was given 22 MPs to ensure that it happens but he successfully pushed the issue into Cold Storage. In fact, Jagan immediately coming to Power, categorically stated that he can only request the Central Government for the Special Status.</p>
      <p>Jagan Mohan Reddy may be fearing Chandrababu Naidu like repercussions if he dared to defy Modi and Shah by raising the issue. Jagan is trying to erase the issue from the memory of the people with Freebies. With the Ruling Party becoming totally silent, we can safely assume that the Special Status is buried forever.</p>
