      <h1>Audited Reports: CBN, FIRS, others flout Senate’s 7-day ultimatum  </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:48:35+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/titobioluwa-okunade/" target="_blank">Titobioluwa Okunade</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Central Bank of Nigeria</b> (CBN), Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and other government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) have flouted the 7-day ultimatum for the submission of audited reports issued by the Nigerian Senate.</p>
      <p><b>According to <a href="https://thenationonlineng.net/senate-reads-riot-act-to-cbn-firs-nddc-others-over-failure-to-submit-audit-reports/">The Nation</a></b>, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Public Accounts, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, reportedly disclosed yesterday that only 7 out of 25 MDAs had submitted their reports or written to explain why they had not submitted their reports.</p>
      <p>“<i>Recall that on 20th November 2019, the Senate Public Accounts Committee called a press conference to draw the attention of some agencies of government numbering 25 about their failure to submit relevant documents on their income and expenditure for its oversight functions. The agencies were given 7 days to send their responses to the Committee,</i>” Urhoghide said.</p>

      <p><b>The chairman, lamenting the refusal</b> of the MDAs to respond to the Committee, urged that it would be best for Nigeria if the MDAs comply and submit their audited reports, stating that failure to do so would result in sanctions as stipulated by the Nigerian constitution.</p>
      <p>“<i>Despite the lapse of time, some agencies have refused to respond to the Committee. The Committee in carrying out its oversight functions will not relent in ensuring that the agencies are called to account for their stewardship in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, Senate Standing Orders and extant Acts.</i></p>
      <p>“<i>It is necessary for these agencies to note that they must comply with the directive of the Committee in the overall public interest,” </i>said Urhoghide.</p>
