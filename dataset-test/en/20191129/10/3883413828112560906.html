      <p>North Korea says it has successfully tested what it describes as a "super-large" multiple-launch rocket system.</p>
      <p>The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KNCA) has released images of leader Kim Jong Un smiling alongside troops as a projectile was fired from a truck-mounted launching system.</p>

      <p>Pyongyang said the launch was the fourth and final test of the system.</p>
      <p>Japan has accused North Korea of serious defiance of the international community - North Korea recently rejecting comments from US President Trump, hinting at a possible <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/donald-trump-takes-first-steps-north-korea-during-meeting-kim-jong-un">resumption of talks on Pyongyang's nuclear and missile test programmes</a>.</p>
      <p>It comes three days after the North announced its troops carried out artillery drills near the disputed sea boundary with its southern neighbour.</p>
      <p>The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KNCA) said leader Kim Jong Un expressed "great satisfaction" over the results of the test-firing.</p>
      <p>"The volley test-fire aimed to finally examine the combat application of the super-large multiple launch rocket system proved the military and technical superiority of the weapon system and its firm reliability," KCNA said.</p>

      <p>South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said the projectiles were aimed at the North's eastern waters, from South Hamgyong province in its north-east.</p>
      <p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said: "The UK is concerned about the latest North Korea missile launches. These launches undermine efforts to secure a peaceful future for the Korean Peninsula.</p>
      <blockquote>"To change the course of its future for the better, North Korea must engage meaningfully with the US in negotiations towards denuclearisation."</blockquote>

      <p>It is believed the launches are an attempt by Pyongyang to pressure the United States to make concessions in the stalled nuclear talks between the nations.</p>
      <p>The negotiations <a href="https://www.forces.net/world/sometimes-you-have-walk-trump-kim-summit-ends-without-nuclear-deal">collapsed in February</a> when North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un's demands for major sanctions relief in return for partial disarmament were rejected by US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, North Korea announced it carried out <a href="https://www.forces.net/north-korea/north-korea-confirms-super-large-rocket-launcher-tests">its third test of a new 'super-large' multiple rocket launcher</a>, with reports now suggesting the system could be mass-produced and rolled out for deployment.</p>
