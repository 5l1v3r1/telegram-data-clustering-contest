      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Police Department says it’s keeping a sharp eye on the still-developing information about a stabbing of multiple people in London.</p>
      <p>The NYPD tweeted Friday that its Counterterrorism Bureau is “closely monitoring” the situation near London Bridge, but there are no specific or credible threats to the city at the moment.</p>
      <p>London’s Metropolitan Police say that while the circumstances remain unclear, authorities are treating the incident as if it is terror-related.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police say officers were called to a stabbing near the famed bridge, and they shot a man.</p>
      <p>Police believe a number of people have been injured.</p>
      <p>In June 2017, attackers inspired by the Islamic State extremist group ran down people on London Bridge, killing two, before stabbing several people to death in nearby Borough Market.</p>
