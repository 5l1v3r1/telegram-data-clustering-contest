      <p>Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah is one of the most-watched television shows currently and has very loyal fans, who have been following the show for years now. However, the show has not been the same with Disha Vakani aka Dayaben’s absence and her comeback on the show has been the talk of the town for a long time now. Last month, a video of Dayaben played on the show and raised people’s curiosity and now, a tailor-made situation has been reportedly created for her comeback.</p>
      <p>According to a report in Jansatta, a tailor-made situation has specially been created for Disha Vakani’s comeback. The upcoming episode will see Bagha explain his dream to Jethalal and mentions that Jethalal’s dad Champak Lal has got bedridden after a sickness. Bagha also says that his dreams mostly come true and this leaves Jethalal awfully scared and helpless. As per the report, it is in this situation of Jethala’s helplessness that Dayaben will be back on Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Shashmah. If these reports are really true, it’s going to make fans really excited!<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/taarak-mehta-ka-ooltah-chashmah-s-rita-reporter-aka-priya-ahuja-blessed-with-a-baby-boy/5ddf9f2102fcc96b801da967"> ALSO READ: Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Rita Reporter Aka Priya Ahuja Blessed With A Baby Boy</a></p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Disha Vakani aka Dayaben had earlier shot for a special scene where she was seen having a one-sided conversation with her on-screen husband Jethalal, which is played by Dilip Kumar, during Navratri. In one scene, we could see Jethalal imagining Dayaben as he read out a letter by her and while he did so, a video of Dayaben is played where she says that she really misses everyone in Gokuldham society and that she cannot wait to come back.</p>
