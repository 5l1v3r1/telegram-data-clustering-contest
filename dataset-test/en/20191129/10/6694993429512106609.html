      <h1>Manchester United hint at Paul Pogba return date from injury</h1>
      <h2>Paul Pogba has not played for Man United since September 30 but is nearing a return from an ankle injury with fixtures against Tottenham and Man City coming up.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Luckhurst, http://www.facebook.com/samuelluckhurstjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Paul Pogba has an outside chance of returning for <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in their Premier League fixture with Jose Mourinho's Tottenham on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/paul-pogba">Pogba</a> has not played since September 30 due to a troublesome ankle injury he originally sustained in the league draw with Southampton on August 31.</p>
      <p>United granted Pogba permission to travel to Dubai last month and he spent time in Miami earlier this month with his wife Zulay and son. Pogba has been posting fitness videos on his Instagram page and Solskjaer said in late October he expected the midfielder to return in December.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay and Fred have played in the majority of league matches without Pogba in a depleted midfield and Solskjaer insists the Frenchman will be 'like a new signing'.</p>
      <p>"So he's stepping up his recovery and let's see how soon he'll be match-fit and available," Solskjaer said. "Of course that's gonna be a new signing for us, he's not really been able to play for us so when we get him back it'll be like a new world-class signing, a new world-class midfielder.</p>
      <p>"Sunday, no. Tottenham? I can't say now, because I've not been home and seen him, let's see where he's at when he comes back and starts training with us.</p>
      <p>"So of course we want him back as soon as possible. Every player is allowed to be injured and when he's injured Paul is working hard to be back, no one can doubt his professionalism, his willingness or his desire to play football, he's a footballer and he's one of the best midfielders in the world.</p>
      <p>"And, as I said before, it'll be like signing a new player before the transfer window opens. Of course we've missed him when he's been away, some of the players - Scotty and Fred - have taken up that challenge and have done well but, of course it's a boost for us when he comes back."</p>
      <p>McTominay has missed the last two matches against Sheffield United and Astana with an ankle injury but Solskjaer suggested he could return against Aston Villa on Sunday. "We hope Scotty will be back as soon as possible and he's been back home so I've not seen him.</p>
      <p>"Maybe Villa, maybe Spurs, hopefully for Sunday."</p>
