      <p>Having lost their first match of the 24th Arabian Gulf Cup, Qatar aim to collect full points against Yemen in today’s Group A match at the Khalifa International Stadium.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Asian champions lost 2-1 to Iraq and now need full points in the next two matches to keep their chances of qualifying for the semi-final stage of the tournament alive.</p>
      <p>Coach Felix Sanchez said his players are ‘fully committed’ and ‘focused’ on the task which lies ahead for them.</p>
      <p>“We are prepared for the Yemen’s game. Everyone knows and understands the importance of the game,” the Spaniard said while speaking to journalists on the eve of the match.</p>
      <p>“I have full confidence in the players and they are fully committed, and they are thirsty to achieve positive results. We will give 100% to achieve (positive) results and provide the best performance, and most importantly to be fully committed and focused,” Sanchez added.</p>
      <p>The Qatar tactician said the hosts created a lot of openings but could not translate them into goals. He was confident his players will be successful on the goal front against Yemen.</p>
      <p>“We were disappointed after the Iraq game despite the opportunities we had we could not score goals. We hope this will change against the Yemen’s game, and we hope to win and score goals,” Sanchez said.</p>
      <p>“We expect a highly competitive game tomorrow and we will go for a win, and the players have all the enthusiasm and motivation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sanchez said Qatar will give fans a lot to cheer in the tournament.</p>
      <p>“We played tough games in Asia, Copa America and, step by step, we will be on the right track to deliver the best possible results,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Yemen coach Sami Al Hadi his players will be on guard against committing any defensive errors against the hosts.</p>
      <p>“A very difficult game awaits us because both the two teams lost their opening game. We hope to provide a good level against Qatar,” Al Hadi said.</p>
      <p>“I hope the team will be in the best shape and the defenders will be more focused, and we expect the hosts to attack so I hope we do not make any defensive mistakes,” he added.</p>
