      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> viewers were heartbroken <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/eastenders-spoilers-jean-slater-receives-tragic-death-news-tonight-10894395/">when Daniel Cook (Adrian Edmondson) faked his own death</a>, leaving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jean-slater/">Jean Slater</a> (Gillian Wright) devastated.</p>
      <p>However the actor teased that we may be seeing more of Daniel in Walford very soon.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on Good Morning Britain, he told Ranvir Singh and Ben Shephard: ‘Because he’s actually technically alive. Who knows whether he will come back or not?’</p>
      <p>The comedian then took a second to wink at the camera – which basically says it all, doesn’t it…</p>
      <p>‘He’s definitely not dead, that’s all I’m allowed to say,’ Ade continued.</p>

      <p>‘It was offered as a story, this is the story of this is bloke. If you cut my bits together, it makes a rather nice story of its own.’</p>

      <p>Petition for a Jean and Daniel spin-off, anyone?</p>
      <p>The pair didn’t have the easiest relationship, with Jean unimpressed by Daniel’s disruptive antics during her chemotherapy sessions, amid her ongoing cancer battle.</p>
      <p>However, they quickly overcame their differences to become close friends, and even shared a kiss at one point.</p>
      <p>Their blossoming relationship was sadly cut short just days later, when the Slater matriarch was told that her new friend had died.</p>
      <p>But this is Albert Square so there was a twist in store for viewers, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/eastenders-spoilers-shock-twist-as-daniel-cook-revealed-to-be-alive-as-jean-slater-attends-his-memorial-service-10900844/">as it emerged that Daniel was well and truly alive</a>, and lied so that Jean didn’t fall in love with him, and wouldn’t be forced to see him through the final stages of his illness.</p>
      <p>Instead, he settled for watching her mourn at his memorial service, before disappearing from Walford.</p>
      <p>For now…</p>
