      <h2>Arsenal sacked Unai Emery on Friday morning following a run of seven matches without a win after immense pressure from Gunners fans to get rid of the failing manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:53:22+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>The Arsenal Supporters' Trust have urged there to be changes in the Gunners' boardroom after Unai Emery was sacked as manager.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Emery was ditched as Gunners boss on Friday morning - just over 12 hours after he had seen his side lose to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>The defeat extended Arsenal's run without a win to seven games, with their last victory in the Premier League coming on October 6.</p>
      <p>The Supporters' Trust admitted that Emery's dismissal was the right decision but questioned the leadership team who made the decision.</p>
      <p>The fans body have been highly critical of technical director Edu, head of football Raul Sanllehi, managing director Vinai Venkatesham, chief negotiator Huss Fahmy and Josh Kroenke - the group who make football decisions at the Emirates.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> Supporters' Trust <a href="https://www.arsenaltrust.org/feed/news/2019/AST_Emerystatement">wrote:</a> “The dismissal of Unai Emery was unfortunate but inevitable. Performances and results have been far below what is expected at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>"But Emery’s departure is the easy part. The more difficult challenge is to recruit a suitable successor. We are far from certain that Arsenal has the right personnel to lead this process.</p>
      <p>"The AST has long been advocating that the most important changes needed at Arsenal are in the Boardroom where Arsenal need better governance.</p>

      <p>"It is a sad fact that the club is now wholly owned by an overseas investment vehicle, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, who are largely absent from London.</p>
      <p>"This means that the club needs to be governed by a strong Board in London, one that is truly independent and has the expertise and dynamism to drive a football club forward.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal’s Board currently has no one with football expertise. Its three 'independent' members are 85, 79 and 77 years old. None of them have football experience nor reflect the diversity of Arsenal’s playing squads nor supporter base.</p>
      <p>"A strong Board would be able to hold the club’s executive to account and to provide them with counsel.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal also need to build better relationships with their supporters especially at the ownership/boardroom level. New appointments to the Board should include looking for people with the skillset to ensure better dialogue with supporters and provide a sense of purpose and direction.</p>
      <p>"So if Arsenal are to genuinely move forward from today it requires not only a new head coach appointment but also a rejuvenation of the boardroom”</p>
