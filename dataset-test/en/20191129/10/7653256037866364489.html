      <p>New Delhi: The entire rail network will be electrified in India which is the only country in the globe that is experimenting to convert diesel engines into electric, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Railways">Railways</a> Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Piyush-Goyal">Piyush Goyal</a> said in Rajya Sabha on Friday.</p>
      <p>This is being done in line with Prime Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi">Narendra Modi</a>'s commitment towards environment protection, Goyal said during Question Hour.</p>
      <p>"Till now six old diesel locomotives have been converted into three twin electric locomotives at Diesel Locomotive Works, Varanasi which is a production unit of Indian Railways," Goyal said.</p>
      <p>These conversions being prototype and since a lot of existing material from discarded locomotives were reused, it is not possible to ascertain the exact cost at this stage, he said.</p>
      <p>The Minister said: "These converted prototype locomotives are under extensive field tests and trials. The number of diesel locomotives is to be decided based upon the performance of the converted prototype locomotives."</p>
      <p>In reply to a supplementary, the minister also said that there is no requirement for conversion of metre gauge and narrow gauge into electric as the government is closing these barring a few places in view of environment or scenic beauty.</p>
