      <p>TRIPOLI: Libya’s National Oil Company said Thursday production had resumed at a key field in the southwest a day after it was interrupted by fighting there.<br/>“Following the cessation of military activity at the (Al-Feel) oilfield, production has resumed,” the NOC said in a statement on its website.<br/>Forces backing eastern-based strongman Khalifa Haftar, who seized Al-Feel earlier this year, on Wednesday accused “militias” who back the Tripoli-based unity government of attacking the site.<br/>Haftar’s forces said they had carried out air raids in response.<br/>No side has yet claimed the original attack.<br/>On Wednesday evening, Haftar’s forces said there had been a “withdrawal of armed groups” after the air raids, without elaborating.<br/>Haftar’s spokesman Ahmad Al-Mesmari confirmed on Facebook that his forces were in control of the site.<br/>Announcing the resumption of output Thursday, the NOC reported “some minor damage” but said no employees had been harmed.<br/>NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla condemned the fighting.<br/>“I remind all parties that Libya’s oil and gas fields are vital sources of revenues for the benefit of all Libyans,” he said.<br/>“When production ceases, all Libyans lose out.”<br/>Al-Feel produces some 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) in a joint venture between the NOC and Italian energy giant ENI.<br/>Forces backing Libya’s unity government have been locked in a months-long struggle with Haftar’s forces, which control much of eastern and southern Libya and in April launched an assault to seize the capital from what they call “terrorist groups.”<br/>Haftar’s rapid advance stalled on the outskirts of Tripoli and the fighting has so far killed more than 1,000 people, according to the United Nations.<br/>Libya has been engulfed in a multi-sided conflict since long-time dictator Muammar Qaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011, with attacks often affecting its vital oil sector.</p>
