        <i>The happy divorcee</i>
      </p>
      <p>I was a reasonably happy wife for almost seven years, and an unhappy one for the following 10. After having children, my husband and I never seemed to get “it” back. I will always remember the night I walked down the stairs, dressed in lingerie. He took one look at me and said, “Don’t even think about it.”</p>
      <p>That marked the death of our sex life. Six years later, his infidelities marked the end of our marriage.</p>
      <p>After an initial period of mourning, I hit the dating sites. One good, if volatile, rebound relationship later, I began to go on dates three or four nights a week. These experiences usually ended in sex, which was a lot of fun. I went to a sex club with one date, hooked up with a few others in parking lots and have been seeing a married man sporadically for more than a year.</p>
      <p>Then, six months ago, I met someone of a similar mind and in a similar emotional space, and we decided that we should be a part of each other’s futures.</p>
      <p>The catch – or blessing, depending on how you look at it – is that he travels for work constantly. As such, he has encouraged me to continue my experiences with others, as it is a huge turn on for him to hear about, and witness, them.</p>
      <p>After being ignored and neglected for years, I have met someone who embraces and encourages my sexuality, and feeds my emotional needs. Someone who isn’t threatened by other partners in my life. Someone who sees a grand future for us.</p>
      <p>I think I’m finally having my cake – and this time I can eat it, too.</p>
