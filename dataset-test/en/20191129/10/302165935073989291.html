      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 29 — The ringgit ended slightly lower against the US dollar today in line the decline in global crude oil prices which affected the local note’s valuation, said a dealer.</p>
      <p>At 6pm, the ringgit settled at 4.1750/1780 against the greenback compared with yesterday’s close of 4.1720/1750.</p>
      <p>A dealer said the benchmark Brent crude trimmed 0.76 per cent to US$62.79 per barrel at the time of writing</p>
      <p>FXTM market analyst Han Tan said in a week when Asian currencies endured mixed fortunes against the US dollar, the ringgit threatened to make a run for the 4.19 mark after breaching above its 50-day moving average, before moderating in the second half of the week.</p>
      <p>“The ringgit has now marked three consecutive months of gains against the US dollar.</p>
      <p>“This week’s market action once again underscores the influence that the ongoing US-China trade negotiations have over global risk appetite, as investors continue pinning their hopes on a limited trade deal between the world’s two largest economies,” he told Bernama.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the ringgit was traded mostly higher against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The local currency was lower against the Singapore dollar at 3.0550/0579 from 3.0537/0579 on Thursday but increased versus the British pound to 5.3807/3859 from 5.3965/4020 yesterday.</p>
      <p>It improved against the yen to 3.8100/8138 from 3.8125/8156 and appreciated against the euro to 4.5938/5987 from 4.5942/5992 previously. — Bernama</p>
