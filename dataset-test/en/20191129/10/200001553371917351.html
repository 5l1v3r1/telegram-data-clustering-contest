      <h1>Club ready to hold talks over Southampton player – Want to agree reduced fee</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.sporx.com/galatasaray-leminanin-tapusunu-almak-istiyor-SXHBQ815379SXQ">Turkish website Sporx</a> claims Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim wants Southampton loanee Mario Lemina to remain at the club beyond this season.</p>
      <p>Gala loaned Lemina from the Premier League side in August, and after a poor start the Gabonese international has found some form in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The 26 year old is now one of the most important members of Terim’s struggling Galatasaray side and Sporx report there’s a genuine desire to get a deal done.</p>
      <p>Lemina’s redemption clause is said to be €16m and it’s claimed Galatasaray officials will negotiate with Southampton in order to get them to reduce this amount.</p>
      <p>Given the finances of the Turkish champions it’s likely they will struggle to pay the €16m, so another season-long loan deal could be a possibility if they can’t get the Saints to go lower.</p>
      <p>The former Juventus midfielder has made 10 appearances for the Super Lig side in all competitions this season. His contract with Southampton will expire at the end of June 2022.</p>
