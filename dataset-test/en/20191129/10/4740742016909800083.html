      <h1>West Country legends The Wurzels are playing a massive gig near Bristol next year</h1>
      <h2>The event includes a hog roast and specialist guest ciders, of course</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:53:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>A legendary West Country band have announced a major gig near Bristol next year.</p>
      <p>Local heroes The Wurzels will be making a return to Cadbury House in Congresbury, a 30-minute drive from the city, in February 2020.</p>
      <p>Performing their all-time classics including I am a Cider Drinker, Blackbird, I’ve Got a Brand New Combine Harvester and Drink Up Thy Zider, the event takes place on Saturday, February 29 in the stunning setting of the four-star hotel.</p>
      <p>Inkeeping with the West Country theme, the night will also include a delicious hog roast served with crackling and apple sauce, plus specialist guest ciders from all over the region for visitors to enjoy.</p>
      <p>The bar will open at 6.30pm and will be accompanied by the sound of Weston College student Chantelle Canniford.</p>
      <p>Support on the night will come from local band snakeSNAKEsnake, a hill-billy five-piece from Somerset who play a mix of "scrumpy &amp; western" inspired originals with a few "loose interpretations" of more familiar songs.</p>
      <p>Then, following a barnstorming set from the main attraction, the entertainment will continue with a disco until 1am.</p>
      <p>Mehment Kandimer, general manager at Cadbury House, said: "The Wurzels are legends around the West Country and to have them perform again here at Cadbury House is fantastic news.</p>

      <p>"The last three performances have completely sold out so we’re advising people get their tickets now.</p>
      <p>"Their unique entertainment style is always a winner and we’ve no doubt that this night will be as good if not better than the last.</p>
      <p>"It’s also great that we’re able to host and support other local bands and musicians on the evening’s bill and both Chantelle and snakeSnakesnake will be the perfect accompaniment to our West Country favourites."</p>
      <p>Tickets for the night cost £29.50 and includes hog roast. Vegetarian and gluten-free options are available on request.</p>
