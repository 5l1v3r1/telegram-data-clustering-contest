      <h1>‘You Meant What You Said’: The Los Angeles Clippers’ Patrick Patterson Apologizes After Being Accused of Calling All Black Women ‘Bulldogs’</h1>

      <p>The Los Angeles Clippers’ <b>Patrick Patterson</b> issued an apology after many said he referred to all Black women as “bulldogs.”</p>
      <p>The controversy started on Oct. 26 when Patterson, who also played for the Toronto Raptors, posted a wedding photo of his wife Sarah Nasser for their anniversary. Afterward, one person said that Patterson wouldn’t have met Nasser, who’s white, if he didn’t play for the NBA.</p>
      <p>“You grew up loving our women,” wrote the follower. “Why wait till you get some real money for your perspective and even if you wasn’t in the NBA worked at a Walmart in Toronto, you wouldn’t stand a chance … You just became another statistic. I bet she’s the only one in her family history to date a black. Stay woke my guy.”</p>

      <p>“So I should settle for a bulldog and act like I’m happy with my life and preach ‘keep it in your race’ to the world as if Dr. King didn’t fight/die for equality, acceptance, all cultures loving one another, and no hate?” Patterson responded. “No thanks. That maybe your life but I don’t want that for mine or for my family. Color doesn’t matter. Wake up.”</p>
      <p>From there, the social media beatdown ensued, and many accused the NBA player of hating his own race, as well as Black women.</p>
      <p>The exchange between Patterson and the Instagram user occurred weeks ago but it picked up steam in recent days.</p>
      <p>And in his apology, the 30-year-old said his “bulldog” comment had to do with trying to insult the wife of the person who criticized him, not all Black women. But there were a lot of people who didn’t accept his explanation at all.</p>
      <p>“My sincere apology to the individual and his family for the cruel comments we exchanged on that day long ago,” wrote Patterson in the caption of his Instagram post.</p>
      <p>And in the actual message he wrote: “I want to address my use of the word “bulldog” during a conversation with someone who I felt was making a disrespectful remark about my wife and our relationship,” he stated. “I responded with the same, making a cruel comment on his wife’s physical stature.”</p>
      <p>“I know that two wrongs don’t make a right, but I let my emotions get the better of me in the heat of the moment,” Patterson went on. “For that, I apologize to him, his wife, and the rest of his family for the hurtful and crude comments made on that day.”</p>

      <p>Patterson then denied hating his own race.</p>
      <p>“As I did in the rest of the conversation thread multiple times, I will clarify again that I was not using the term as a reference to black women. That is not at all how I feel, but I do not need to justify to the world that I love my black people. I have no animosity or bitterness towards any race. I believe in love and equality.”</p>
      <p>“Naw you meant what you said BLACK MAN. Stand by your words,” someone responded in the comments.</p>
      <p>“I’m not accepting this statement sir,” someone else wrote. “You called that man’s WIFE a ‘Bulldog’ because she was BLACK. Period … You got triggered because you couldn’t tell him an answer that would actually make sense . 🙄”  </p>
      <p>“You said, ‘So I should settle for a bulldog…?’ a third person commented. “You didn’t say ‘Your (referring to the person you’re arguing with) wife is a bulldog.’ It’s not the same thing.”</p>
      <p>“Try again with that apology,” that person added. “But this time address it to your mother, her mother and the generations of black women who came before them.”</p>
