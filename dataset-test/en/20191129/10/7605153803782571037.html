      <h1>Arsenal fire Emery after worst run in decades</h1>

        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 29 – Unai Emery was sacked as Arsenal manager on Friday after less than two years in charge and with the club without a win in seven games, their worst run since 1992.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 48-year-old Spaniard was fired following the 2-1 home defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in Thursday’s Europa League match.</p>
      <p>His assistant Freddie Ljungberg takes over as interim manager during the search for a permanent replacement.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans had demanded “decisive action” from directors with the club’s run of five draws and two defeats just one match off equalling George Graham’s run of eight without a win in 1992.</p>
      <p>Club directors responded by axing the man appointed in May 2018 to revive a club stagnating after two decades under Frenchman Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>“We announce today that the decision has been taken to part company with our head coach Unai Emery and his coaching team,” read the statement.</p>
      <p>“We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach.</p>
      <p>“The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete.”</p>
      <p>Ljungberg will be the first Swedish manager to take charge of a Premier League game since Sven-Goran Eriksson, whose last game in the competition came in May 2008 in charge of Manchester City.</p>

      <p>Among those in the mix for the permanent job include former Gunners star Mikel Arteta, Pep Guardiola’s assistant at champions Manchester City, ex-Juventus handler Massimiliano Allegri — Sky Sports reported there had been contact between the two parties — and Portuguese manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who is at Wolves.</p>
      <p>Napoli’s coach Carlo Ancelotti is another name that has entered the reckoning — he won the domestic double in the 2009/10 campaign when in charge of Chelsea — but Nuno is the early bookies favourite at 11/10.</p>
      <p>However, Nuno, 45, has had two spells in charge of relatively high profile clubs at Valencia and Porto and did not enjoy success.</p>
      <p>
        <b> – ‘Rejuvenation’ –</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emery’s cause has not been helped by the controversy over Granit Xhaka. The Swiss international swore at Gunners fans when Emery took him off against Crystal Palace last month. Emery responded by stripping Xhaka of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Pepe, Arsenal’s record signing, has been a huge disappointment since his £72 million ($93 million) move from French Ligue 1 outfit Lille in the close season. Under Emery the club has spent at least £200 million.</p>

      <p>Emery’s position had looked shaky enough when north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur sacked Mauricio Pochettino last week only months after he took Spurs to the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Emery’s first season ended in disappointment. Arsenal blew two chances for a return to the Champions League, winning just one of their last five games to finish fifth in the Premier League and then losing the Europa League final 4-1 to Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“Our most sincere thanks go to Unai and his colleagues who were unrelenting in their efforts to get the club back to competing at the level we all expect and demand,” read the club statement.</p>
      <p>“We wish Unai and his team nothing but future success.</p>
      <p>“The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.”</p>
      <p>Supporters see the board, and especially unpopular American owner Stan Kroenke as part of the problem.</p>
      <p>The influential Arsenal Supporters’ Trust, the official supporters’ club, issued a statement welcoming the departure of Emery but calling for further radical changes.</p>
      <p>“Emery’s departure is the easy part,” read their statement.</p>
      <p>“The more difficult challenge is to recruit a suitable successor.</p>
      <p>“We are far from certain that Arsenal has the right personnel to lead this process.</p>
      <p>“If Arsenal are to genuinely move forward from today it requires not only a new head coach appointment but also a rejuvenation of the boardroom.”</p>
