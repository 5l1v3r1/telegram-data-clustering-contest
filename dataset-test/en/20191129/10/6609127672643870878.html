      <p>The offences include setting off fireworks, rowdy behaviour, insulting police officers and “selling things illegally”.</p>
      <p>The nationality of those detained is largely unknown but it has been reported that one Scottish fan was arrested for public intoxication.</p>
      <p>Police said that before, during and immediately after the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5007741/feyenoord-2-rangers-2-europa-league/">2-2 Europa League draw</a> that it was a "manageable evening".</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: "I can confirm a total of 42 arrests. Overall at was a manageable evening."</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard's side earned a point thanks to a stunning double from Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p>But his side will have to wait another two weeks to seal their place in the knockout stages after Porto's late win over Young Boys.</p>
      <p>The Light Blues need just a point from their final game to secure European football after Christmas.</p>
      <p>Boss Gerrard hailed deadly Morelos after the match and defended <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5008063/rangers-fc-news-gerrard-morelos-50m/">his £50million valuation</a> of the Colombian striker.</p>
      <p>We told how around <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4999096/rangers-feyenoord-amsterdam-dam-square/">10,000 Gers fans</a> were set to make the trip over to Holland despite only 3,000 having match tickets.</p>
      <p>Travelling supporters gathered in Dam Square, Amsterdam, before making the trip to the stadium – around an hour away.</p>
      <p>One video emerged last night <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/5004270/rangers-amsterdam-dam-square-feyenoord/">of a violent clash</a> which spilled onto the street from a bar in the area.</p>
