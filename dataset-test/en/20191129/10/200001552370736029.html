      <h1>Club chief contacts Stoke City forward’s agent over possible transfer, offer being lined up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T10:45:06+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.yeniasir.com.tr/spor/2019/11/28/goztepeden-bomba">Izmir-based regional newspaper Yeni Asir,</a> Goztepe are interested in signing Stoke City forward Mame Biram Diouf.</p>
      <p>The Aegean side currently have Cameron Jerome on their books, but are looking to sign one more attacker in the new year to take some of the burden from the 33 year old.</p>
      <p>Yeni Asir report Diouf is on their shortlist and the Turkish club will make an offer to sign the player when the transfer window opens in January. It’s claimed the former Manchester United player is considering leaving Stoke City and Goztepe could be an option for him.</p>
      <p>Goztepe president Mehmet Sepil has also contacted Diouf’s agent, and Yeni Asir say the Super Lig side ‘will push hard’ to land the 31 year old.</p>
      <p>Diouf has made just two appearances for Stoke City this season and scored one goal. His contract with the Potters will expire at the end of the season and it seems at this stage the Championship side will not be extending his stay.</p>
