      <p>Even when they don't mean to, JB still finds a way to be savage to <i>Anthem</i>.</p>
      <p>As part of their Black Friday deals, JB are flogging all versions of <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/?q=anthem&amp;hPP=36&amp;idx=shopify_products&amp;p=0"><i>Anthem</i> for $4.</a> That's staggering for a) a BioWare game which b) launched in February and, remarkably c) it's still not worth it, because a month of EA Access on PS4 or Xbox One costs you $5 a month, and the extra buck means you can play literally any other EA game for the same price. (Origin Access, the PC version of <a href="https://www.origin.com/aus/en-us/store/origin-access">EA's subscription service</a>, is a little pricer, but you can also pay $20 for a month and grab <i>Jedi Fallen Order</i>, so that's not a bad alternative.)</p>

      <p>Poor <i>Anthem</i> has been brutalised over the last year. The game was so rushed that its own developers didn't know what the game was meant to be when it had that first <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/04/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong/">major showing at E3.</a> Weeks before the game's launch, EA redirect millions in marketing and appearance fees from <i>Anthem</i> into <i>Apex Legends</i> instead, which ended up being one of the smash hits of the year. As for Bioware's action adventure, major updates were then halted and <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem/">cancelled entirely</a>, with the studio reportedly looking at overhauling all of the game's systems completely.</p>

      <p>Like <i>Andromeda</i>, the cost of grabbing <i>Anthem</i> now is so low that it would be hard not to get some enjoyment out of the game. But you could also get a lot more for your $4. Hell, three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0/000F">is cheaper than that</a>. Would you really rather play <i>Anthem</i> over <i>The Outer Worlds</i>, <i>Afterparty</i> or <i>Dishonored 2</i>? Or hundreds of other games? Probably not.</p>
      <p>Poor <i>Anthem</i>.</p>
