      </p>
      <p>Brad Gobright, 31, fell to his death while he was abseiling down a cliff in El Potrero Chico.</p>
      <p>Aidan Jacobson, 26, was with him and also fell, but he escaped with an ankle injury.</p>

      <p>The US State Department said: "We are closely monitoring local authorities' investigation and are providing all appropriate consular assistance. Out of respect to the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment."</p>
      <p>They were simul-rappelling, where two climbers descend from opposite strands of an anchored rope using themselves to counterweight each other, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Mr Jaconson said: "I asked if we were good, and he said, ‘Yes, we can untangle the rope on the way down.</p>
      <p>"We didn’t tie knots in the rope, either. We started rapping. I was a bit above him. I was on the left.</p>
      <p>"He was on the right. Then all of a sudden, I felt a pop, and we started dropping."</p>
      <p>Climber Alex Honnold led tributes to the athlete.</p>

      <p>He wrote on Instagram: "I’m so sorry to hear that Brad Gobright just died in a climbing accident.</p>
      <p>"He was such a warm, kind soul – one of a handful of partners that I always loved spending a day with. I suppose there’s something to be said about being safe out there and the inherent risks in climbing but I don’t really care about that right now.</p>
      <p>"I’m just sad for Brad and his family. And for all of us who were so positively affected by his life. So crushing.</p>
      <p>"Brad was a real gem of a man. For all his strengths and weaknesses (like his insanely strong fingers, or living out of a Honda Civic...) at the core he was just a good guy.</p>
      <p>"I guess there’s nothing really to say. I’m sad. The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace.</p>
