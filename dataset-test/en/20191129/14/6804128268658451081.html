      <h1>Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers comments on replacing Unai Emery at "fantastic" Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>The Foxes boss has seen his name thrown into the ring to replace Emery, who was sacked on Friday morning</h2>

      <p>Brendan Rodgers is just one of the names that has been linked with the role of Arsenal manager since the Gunners ditched Unai Emery as head coach on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Emery's stay in north London lasted a little under 18 months but he was given the boot following Arsenal's 2-1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday and with Arsenal in the midst of their worst run of form since 1992.</p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg has been placed in temporary charge and took training at London Colney on Friday morning. Emery had arrived at the training ground as usual ready to take the session but as swiftly pulled aside into a meeting where he was given his marching orders.</p>
      <p>Rodgers, who is enjoying a superb campaign with Leicester City as they sit second in the Premier League standings, is one of a number of names rumoured to be of interest to Arsenal as a replacement for Emery alongside Italian's Max Allegri and Carlo Ancelotti, as well as former midfielder Mikel Arteta who came close to getting the job before Emery.</p>
      <p>Rodgers, speaking at a pre-match press conference ahead of the Foxes game against Everton this weekend, was asked about Emery's sacking and his thoughts on replacing the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>He said: "There's disappointment whenever a coach loses his job. Unai has proved himself over a number of years. I have sympathy for him.</p>

      <p>"It’s natural that there are links. If you are doing okay people want to take you away from something you enjoy. If you’re not it doesn't matter</p>
      <p>"There's always a number of names. We're at the beginning of something here.</p>
      <p>"My relationship with the people here and the players is very strong.</p>
      <p>"We think we are starting something exciting. Arsenal is a fantastic club. One of the greats in this country. If the people at Arsenal have moved Unai on, I’m sure they have an idea of who they want to bring in."</p>
