      <h1>Dying 'Star Wars' fan to get 'The Rise of Skywalker' preview</h1>
      <h2>Young fan is under hospice care</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/12/perspectives/disney-streaming-service/index.html">Disney</a> has granted a dying<a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/27/us/star-wars-instant-pot-trnd/index.html"> "Stars Wars</a>" fan's wish to watch the new movie in the franchise, "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," with his young son ahead of its release date, after responding to an appeal from the hospice where he is being treated.</p>
      <p>Rowans Hospice in Hampshire, England, took to Twitter on Tuesday to make the plea on behalf of one of its patients, saying "time is not on his side" for mid-December, when the movie is scheduled to be released in the UK.</p>
      <p>The appeal met with strong support on social media, with the likes of Mark Hamill -- Luke Skywalker himself -- wishing the hospice "<a href="https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/1199417826169122817">good luck</a>" with its request.</p>
      <p>Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and CEO, tweeted on Thursday that the company would allow the patient a preview: "On this Thanksgiving, we at @Disney are grateful to be able to share #TheRiseOfSkywalker with a patient and his family @RowansHospice. May the force be with you and with us all!"</p>
      <p>In a statement from Rowans Hospice, Lisa Davies, the health care support worker who passed the patient's wish on to other staff members, said she was "<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/117Ut4tm18w3DA0wZJzlo4DDx0dc7zzJi/view">utterly speechless</a>."</p>
      <p>Thanking Disney for its help, she said: "We totally appreciate that they have had to move mountains to make this happen!"</p>
      <p>"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," which is due to be released on December 19 in the UK and December 20 in the US, will be the final installment of the nine-part saga.</p>
