      <h1>Arsenal Fan TV hit back at Ray Parlour after Gunners legend's criticism</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery was sacked on Friday morning after Arsenal had struggled to seven matches without a win. Subsequently Ray Parlour and AFTV are locked in a war of words</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:13:22+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Ray Parlour has criticised Arsenal Fan TV and rebranded them as ' <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> Fail TV' in the wake of Unai Emery's departure from north London.</p>
      <p>But the channel has fired back at the Gunners legend and turned his condemnation back at him.</p>
      <p>AFTV, as they are now officially known, meet after every Arsenal match to discuss what they have just seen and the latest goings-on at the club - with it popping into the public consciousness whenever they are doing badly.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have been in poor form recently - having failed to win any of their last seven matches in all competitions - with Emery sacked as manager on Friday morning following the previous evening's defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League.</p>

      <p>And Parlour slammed AFTV for their negative manner in the recent history.</p>
      <p>"Was that Arsenal Fan TV? They want them to fail," Parlour said on talkSPORT after being shown a clip of the YouTube stars.</p>
      <p>“How can they call it Arsenal Fan TV? “Arsenal Fan TV want Arsenal to lose as it is better for them.”</p>
      <p>“They should call it Arsenal Fail TV if I'm being honest.”</p>

      <p>Regular contributor DT was not impressed when he heard Parlour's quotes and took to social media to called the ex-midfielder a hypocrite.</p>
      <p>DT wrote on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "You were not calling it that when you were on there, Ray.</p>
      <p>"You might be a legend of the club but it does not mean you can go around talking rubbish about fans who go to every single game and saying they enjoy losing, it’s the radio show YOU work for that enjoy seeing Arsenal lose!"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Parlour has identified what interim manager Freddie Ljungberg's priorities should be.</p>
      <p>“Defensively, you have to be much better. How many times have Arsenal been in front and suddenly, they’ll always give the other team a chance to get back into the game. Sometimes you have to see a game out," he told talkSPORT.</p>
      <p>“Get a unit set and I think Freddie would do that because he played in sides that did that.</p>
      <p>"When we played against sides and we were in front but right up against it, he knows how to organise that midfield area because it’s not all about the defence, it’s about the shield in front of them.</p>
      <p>“They come from all angles in midfield, there’s no structure. You might well put four or five bodies forward but when it breaks down, suddenly the opposition are at the back four.”</p>
