      <p>VALLETTA, Nov 29 — Malta’s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has told associates he plans to resign imminently, the <i>Times of Malta</i> reported today.</p>
      <p>His decision was brought on by the political and legal crisis brought about by the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Authorities have questioned Muscat’s right-hand man Keith Schembri this week in their investigation into the murder of Caruana Galizia, who was blown up by a car bomb in 2017.</p>
      <p>Her family demanded today that Muscat resign, after Schembri was set free overnight. Schembri, who resigned this week as Muscat’s chief of staff, denies wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, Muscat’s cabinet turned down a request to pardon a businessman, Yorgen Fenech, over the murder in return for testimony that Fenech’s lawyers said would implicate senior government figures including Schembri.</p>
      <p>After two years of stalled investigations, the authorities have moved rapidly in recent days in the murder case. — Reuters</p>
