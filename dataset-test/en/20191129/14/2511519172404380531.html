      <h1>Next Arsenal manager: Pep Guardiola reacts to Mikel Arteta speculation following Unai Emery dismissal</h1>
      <h2>Emery sacked as Arsenal manager on Friday morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:14:04+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Critchley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> remained coy when asked about the future of his assistant <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MikelArteta">Mikel Arteta</a>, who has been linked with the vacancy at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a>.</p>
      <p>Arsenal sacked manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> on Friday morning following a string of poor results and underwhelming performances, culminating in Thursday’s Europa League defeat to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Arteta was approached by Arsenal following Arsene Wenger’s departure from the Emirates 18 months ago, though then-chief executive Ivan Gazidis ultimately appointed Emery.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard is now a leading candidate to replace Emery but Guardiola gave little away when asked about interest in Arteta on Friday.</p>
      <p>“He’s in the squad,” he said. “He travels to Newcastle [for City’s lunchtime Premier League kick-off on Saturday]. It’s not a question for me.” </p>
      <p>Arteta is a former Arsenal player, making 110 appearances after joining from Everton and serving as club captain before his retirement in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old subsequently joined Guardiola’s staff at City and has enhanced his reputation in coaching circles while at the club.</p>
      <p>Guardiola allowed Arteta to take responsibility of City’s set-up for a game against Arsenal during the 2016-17 season and has always said that his assistant will become a manager one day.</p>
