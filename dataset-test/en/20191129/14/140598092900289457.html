      <h1>Euro 2020 finals draw: what date is it, which teams have qualified and how to watch live</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:15:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/angus-williams/" target="_blank">Angus Williams</a></address>
      <h3>What is happening?</h3>
      <p>The draw for the group stage of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/euro-2020/">Euro 2020 tournament. </a></p>
      <h3>When and where is it?</h3>
      <p>Saturday 30 November in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
      <h3>What time does it start?</h3>
      <p>The draw kicks off at 18:00 CET. That’s 5pm GMT.</p>
      <h3>How can I watch it?</h3>
      <p>This is as of yet unconfirmed, but you will be able to follow live with <i>Telegraph Sport.</i></p>
      <h3>Who has qualified?</h3>
      <p>The main section of Euro 2020 qualifying has finished already, with 20 teams having booked their spot at next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>So far England, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Portugal, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Denmark, Croatia, Spain, Sweden, Poland, Austria, France, Turkey, Belgium, Russia, Italy, Finland and Wales have already confirmed their places. </p>
      <p>There are still four places up for grabs through the play-offs, which will be contested by the following 16 teams: Iceland, Bosnia, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary, Romania, Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Belarus. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/euro-2020-play-offs-explained-nations-league-route-qualification/">How these 16 teams will be whittled down to four is explained in full here</a>.  </p>
      <p>Unusually for a major tournament, the host nations do not qualify automatically. That’s because the tournament is spread across 12 different European cities with Wembley set to host the semi-finals and final as well as England's three group stage games.</p>

      <h3>How does the draw work?</h3>
      <p>The 12 host cities are split evenly across the six groups: two host cities in each. Any host nation that qualifies will automatically go into the group which will seen games in that country. England, for example, will be in Group D - which will see three Wembley matches - and they will be joined by Scotland if they win their play-off, with three more Group D matches to be played in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The following host nations have already qualified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Group A</b> - Italy</li>
        <li><b>Group B</b> - Russia and Denmark</li>
        <li><b>Group C </b>- Holland</li>
        <li><b>Group D</b> - England</li>
        <li><b>Group E</b> - Spain</li>
        <li><b>Group F</b> - Germany</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As one of the top seeds (more details below), Belgium have to go into Group B. Russia's position means Ukraine cannot also be in Group B, so as the only other top seed, Ukraine must go into Group C, where they join Holland.</p>
      <p>The remaining spots in each group will be allocated by drawing the teams out of four pots which have been seeded depending on where the teams finish in their qualifying groups. </p>
      <p>However, there are certain teams that Uefa will not let be drawn in the same group as each other if they qualify, for instance, Ukraine and Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, or Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.  </p>
      <h3>The pots</h3>
      <p>One team from each of the following pots will go into each of the six Euro 2020 groups.</p>
      <p><b>Pot 1</b> Belgium, Italy (hosts), England (hosts), Germany (hosts), Spain (hosts), Ukraine.</p>
      <p><b>Pot 2</b> France, Poland, Switzerland, Croatia, Netherlands (hosts), Russia (hosts).</p>
      <p><b>Pot 3</b> Portugal, Turkey, Denmark (hosts), Austria, Sweden, Czech Republic.</p>
      <p><b>Pot 4</b> Wales, Finland, Winner play-off Path A, Winner play-off Path B, Winner play-off Path C, Winner play-off Path D.</p>
      <p>Play-offs will be played in late March 2020.</p>
      <h3>Who could England get?</h3>
      <p>England will be in Group D. Scotland will join them if they win their play-off in March.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, as a Pot 1 team England can be drawn against any non-host nation team from Pots 2, 3 and 4.</p>
      <p>So, England will be drawn against one of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>France, Poland, Switzerland or Croatia</li>
        <li>Portugal, Turkey, Austria, Sweden or Czech Republic; and</li>
        <li>Wales, Finland or one of the play-off winners</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The worst possible draw England could face is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>England, France, Portugal, Iceland</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The best possible draw England could face is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>England, Switzerland, Czech Republic, North Macedonia</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who is likely to win Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>France are favourites with the bookies. England are the second favourites, with Belgium, Germany and Spain in the chasing pack.  </p>
