        <b>James Abraham, Jos</b>
      </p>
      <p>Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has urged his main challenger during the 2019 governorship election, Senator Jeremiah Useni of the Peoples Democratic Party to concede defeat and join hands with his administration to move the state forward.</p>
      <p>Lalong said this on Friday while reacting to the Court of Appeal judgement which affirmed his victory at the poll.</p>
      <p>Useni, through his counsel, Mr Edward Pwajok, SAN, had faulted the Appeal Court judgment which dismissed his petition against Lalong and said he would “press further” to reclaim his mandate.</p>
      <p>But Lalong in a statement on Friday advised the PDP candidate to abandon the course of action and team up with his government for the good of the people.</p>
      <p>According to the statement signed by the governor’s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Makut Simon Macham, Lalong said, “This is not a victory for me but for the entire people of Plateau State, who have demonstrated faith in our Rescue Mission. Like I have repeatedly said, I’m governor for everyone irrespective of party, tribe, religious or any other affiliation. I’m ready to carry everyone along.”</p>
      <p>The governor, who described his victory at the Appeal Court as yet another collective victory for the entire people of Plateau State added that the verdict of the court didn’t surprise him as he has never doubted the validity of the mandate reposed in him and the APC.</p>
      <p>He called on Plateau citizens to continue supporting his administration.</p>
