      <p>Nadine Coyle has lifted the lid on her “passionate” romance with Jesse Metcalfe.</p>
      <p>The former Girls Aloud star dated the hunky Desperate Housewives actor for two and a half years, after meeting in 2006.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Jacqueline Jossa and Adele Roberts on I’m A Celeb last night, Nadine said: “My second boyfriend was an actor and I’d fancied him from TV.”</p>
      <p>“I used to think he is so gorgeous and I was doing an interview and it was one of those ‘who do you fancy’ things and I said the gardener from Desperate Housewives.”</p>

      <p>The songstress then revealed: “I met him out we had a great night, it was just like everything was right.”</p>
      <p>“He came over to me and I thought, woo you smell amazing. I went out to the bathroom and he came behind me and pulled me back and said, ‘You are going into the men’s.’ It wasn’t, it was the ladies, but he said he just wanted to say something to me.”</p>
      <p>After hitting it off, Jesse ended up leaving the party with her, and the rest was history.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We had a great time,” she recalled. “He was really passionate, super passionate and fun. Physically he was my ideal man.”</p>
