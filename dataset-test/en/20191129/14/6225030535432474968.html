      <p>As thoroughly dominating as <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Complexifier">Complexifier</a></b>’s two most recent starts may have been, trainer Brian Lynch hasn’t let himself catch Kentucky Derby Fever.<br/>Fort Springs Racing’s Complexifier will conclude his 2-year-old season in the $75,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Buffalo_Man_Stakes">Buffalo Man</a></b>, a six-furlong sprint on Saturday’s Juvenile Showcase program at Gulfstream Park, without any expectations that he will be a player on the 2020 Triple Crown trail.<br/>“I think he’s primarily a six- to seven-furlong horse. I don’t have any ambitions to stretch him out too far,” Lynch said. “In a perfect world, he could be a [H. Allen Jerkens], Woody Stephens-type horse for next year.”<br/>Complexifier has won his last two starts going away, breaking his maiden at Churchill Downs in his third career race Sept. 20 by 2 ½ lengths before winning an entry-level optional claiming allowance at Keeneland Oct. 17, also by 2 ½ lengths. Both scores were at six furlongs.<br/>“He knocked at the door his first couple starts at Saratoga and we got lucky enough to break his maiden at Churchill. He came back and won a nice a-other-than at Keeneland,” Lynch said. “He seems like he’s trying to go in the right direction.”<br/>The Kentucky-bred son of Overanalyze debuted July 27 at Saratoga, where he close with a wide run to finish third at 5 ½ furlongs. He bobbled at the start in his next start at Saratoga before recovering to finish second.<br/>“He’s always been a hiccup-free little horse. He always worked good. His first couple races, he just needed to work it out. It seems like he’s got it now,” Lynch said.<br/>Nik Juarez has been named to ride Complexifier for the first time.<br/>Daniel Damen’s Ricki Ticki Taffi earned a shot to run in the Buffalo Man with a gutsy maiden-breaking performance at Gulfstream Park Aug. 25. The son of Field Commander, who finished fourth in his debut after a less-than-ideal trip, set a pressured pace while scoring by a nose.<br/>“In his maiden, he was game. A horse passed him and he battled back and beat him,” trainer Saffie Joseph Jr. said. “He’s trained forwardly from the gate. He’s going to need to improve again, but one thing about him is that he is a hard-trying horse. He’s very gutsy.”<br/>Samy Camacho has the mount.<br/>Gary and Mary West’s Went West will enter the Buffalo Man off a debut score. The son of Union Rags rallied from far back to score by three lengths at Parx Oct. 25.<br/>Trainer Jason Servis awarded the mount aboard the Kentucky-bred colt to Luis Saez.<br/>Magic Stables LLC’s and Top Racing LLC’s Iberico, who rebounded from an off-the-board finish in the Saratoga Special (G2) to win an entry-level optional claiming allowance at Gulfstream Park Sept. 21, will seek his third victory in his last four starts Saturday.<br/>Santiago Gonzalez has the mount aboard the Antonio Sano-trained son of Dialed In.<br/>Jacks or Better Farm’s Shivaree is scheduled to run in the Buffalo Man just seven days after winning a seven-furlong maiden special weight race by 9 ½ lengths.<br/>Emisael Jaramillo has the mount aboard the Ralph Nick’s trained half-brother to multiple stakes-winning Garter and Tie, who captured the Smooth Air last season.<br/>Sun Squall, Aycapote and Dialed In Gold round out the field.</p>
