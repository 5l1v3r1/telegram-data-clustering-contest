      <p>A petty trader, Mrs Molade Owolabi, on Thursday lost her 11-year-old marriage to alleged adultery, as an Igando Customary Court in Lagos granted her estranged husband’s request to dissolve the union.</p>
      <p>The Court President, Mr Koledoye Adeniyi, held that it appeared that the couple was tired of the marriage as efforts to reconcile them failed.</p>
      <p>“Since both parties consented to the dissolution of their marriage, this court has no choice than to dissolve the marriage.</p>
      <p>“The court hereby pronounces the marriage between Mr Tayo Owolabi and Mrs Molade Owolabi dissolved today; both of you henceforth cease to be husband and wife.</p>

      <p>“Each of you should go his or her separate way unmolested; the court wishes both of you well in your future endeavours,” he said.</p>
      <p>Koledoye said that the petitioner must be responsible for their children’s feeding, education and general welfare.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN ) reports that Tayo had sought an end to the marriage, claiming that Molade brought her lover into their bedroom for sex.</p>
      <p>“Our 11-year-old daughter used to tell me that her mother brings a man home and that she used to see them making love.</p>
      <p>“I once saw her love chat on WhatsApp with a man called Timothy; when I asked her, she quickly deleted those messages. I reported her to her two eldest sisters,” he submitted.</p>
      <p>Tayo also told the court that Molade was having an extra-marital affair with another man identified as Stanley.</p>
      <p>“Molade came to my mother’s burial in Ondo State and left that same day; I later discovered that she came with Stanley and both of them lodged in a hotel.</p>
      <p>“I was still in my village when Molade called that she was sick and admitted. I rushed to Lagos the following day and I was told by the nurses that a man came to pass the night with her; I later discovered him to be Stanley.</p>
      <p>“When I confronted Stanley, he confessed that he was in a relationship with my wife but begged for forgiveness.</p>
      <p>“I decided to know more about Stanley; so, I searched for him on Facebook and saw pictures of him and my wife which were taken inside our bedroom and on our bed,” he added.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old unemployed presented to the court the pictures printed from Stanley’s Facebook page as evidence.</p>
      <p>The petitioner said that he moved out of their matrimonial home when his wife said she needed space.</p>
      <p>“There was a day we had a misunderstanding and she got me arrested.</p>
      <p>“At the police station, I was asked to make an undertaking that I would not return to my house, a promise I have kept.</p>
      <p>“Two weeks after I left the house, my wife changed her marital status on Facebook from married to divorce and also changed her surname to her maiden name.</p>
      <p>“Our neighbours called to tell me that Stanley always came to pass the night at our house.”</p>
      <p>According to him, Molade has been denying him sex since December 2018, and always threatened his life with a knife.</p>
      <p>In her response, Molade consented to the divorce and accused her husband of infidelity.</p>
      <p>“My husband has been cheating on me without my knowledge. I got to know last week when I went to his family house, where I met his new wife and a baby of about six months.”</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old trader denied having affairs with Timothy and Stanley.</p>
      <p>“I sell watermelon; Timothy is my customer while Stanley comes to assist me in my shop.</p>
      <p>“The picture of Stanley and I that my husband saw on social media were taken in the sitting room not in our bedroom as he claimed.</p>
      <p>“Stanley came to stay with me when I was admitted at a hospital because my husband travelled for his mother’s burial and there was nobody to stay with me,’’ she said.</p>
      <p>The mother of three said that Tayo turned her into a punching bag.</p>
      <p>“My husband is a wife-beater; he once beat me to the extent that I lost a pregnancy. I have scars on my body due to his frequent physical assaults on me.</p>
      <p>“One day, he beat me, tore my clothes and pushed me out of the house naked. Our neighbours clothed me; I went to the police station to report the matter, and he was invited.</p>
      <p>“When the police asked me what I wanted, I said I needed space – that he should leave the house for me for some time.</p>
      <p>He was then asked to make an undertaking that he would give me space as I requested,’’ Molade told the court.</p>
      <p>Molade also said she denied her husband sex because she no longer had any sexual feeling toward him. (NAN)</p>
