      <p>Struggling with growing scepticism of vaccinations, health authorities in Moscow have turned to a surprising ally for help: blood-thirsty vampires.</p>
      <p>A video posted by the Moscow health department this week features a black-clad, long-haired vampire and his fang-baring young daughter.</p>
      <p>During a visit to the doctor, they ask if it is safe for the girl to drink blood from the unvaccinated.</p>
      <p>After suggesting that it would be better not to drink blood at all, the doctor warns unvaccinated blood could be "very dangerous", then lays out the benefits of vaccinations.</p>
      <p>"So is this why some parents are rejecting vaccinations?" the vampire father asks. "To stop us from biting their children?"</p>
      <p>The video ends with a message urging parents to have their children vaccinated.</p>
      <p>It was released as city authorities look for ways to boost vaccination rates. On Thursday local deputies including the head of the city's public health committee recommended making vaccinations mandatory.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF warned in July that vaccination rates around the world have "dangerously" stalled -- in many cases due to increasing suspicion of vaccines.</p>
      <p>The WHO also said in August that measles cases were skyrocketing in Europe and sounded the alarm over vaccination rates.</p>
      <p>Russia was among four countries -- along with Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Georgia -- that were home to 78 percent of measles cases in the first six months of 2019.</p>
      <p>The "anti-vax" movement has been fuelled by false claims that vaccinations cause disease or conditions such as autism.</p>
      <p>A study out of George Washington University last year found that social media bots and Russian trolls "spread false information about vaccines" online in a bid to sow discord in the United States.</p>
