      <p>After being a fan favourite for years on end - it appears <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here</a>'s! popularity may be dwindling.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> reality show first hit our screens in 2002, but this year is not quite hitting the mark for some viewers, who are claiming the 19th series is 'boring'.</p>
      <p>Some are now even threatening to switch off after 'quick' trials and 'nicey nicey' camp mates frustrate fans who are hungry for some more action, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-fans-threaten-switch-17335289">Manchester Evening News</a>.</p>
      <p>Viewing figures are down from last year - the 2019 launch episode averaged 10 million with a peak of 10.9 million while 2018 peaked at 11.6 million viewers.</p>
      <p>Viewers are above all not impressed with the celebrities and the bushtucker trials themselves.</p>
      <p>The show has come with some controversy after the first live trial, which featured all 12 celebrities, was <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/im-celeb-fans-demand-justice-3574242">branded a 'fix' by viewers</a> at home who said James Haskell and Roman Kemp's challenge was impossible.</p>
      <p>ITV was hit by 48 complaints from fans who insisted that they had no chance to win the task due to the short period of time they had to complete it.</p>

        <figcaption>Fans have said the trials are too 'quick' and say the show is 'more a chore than enjoyment'</figcaption>

      <p>One viewer raged on Twitter: “Bland bland bland bland, paint dry, bland bland bland, too safe, bland bland blah blah boring sh**e! First year ever I have given up on it!</p>
      <p>“Ant n Dec still good but by Christ everybody else!?”</p>
      <p>A second posted: “Stop being so nicey nicey is getting boring, spice it up and also make that challenges more challenging.”</p>

      <p>A third said: “#ImACeleb is actually painfully boring this year. It’s a bit like #TheWalkingDead watching it feels more of a chore than an enjoyment.”</p>
      <p>Another added: “Why is 2019 so boring.  Trials are so quick, no real feel for anything #bored, plus who cares about blinking Kard family all the time #desperate.”</p>
      <p>Others have criticised the fact that so much has been crammed into the first week.</p>

      <p>“Why has it taken a week for the first single person trial? What is going on this year?? Care packages 1 week in, new campmates 3 days in, eating challenge also within the first week,” said another.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere fans are frustrated with the length of episodes - many of which are over the usual 60 minutes, including Thursday’s which was one and a half hours.</p>
      <p>One viewer complained: “Is it just me or is I'm a celebrity boring this year? It really doesn't need to be on until 10:30 every night either.. Such a drag.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “Completely given up on watching #ImACeleb this year, boring as f***.”</p>
