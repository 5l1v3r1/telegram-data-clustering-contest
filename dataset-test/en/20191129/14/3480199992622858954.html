      <p>Boris Johnson has warned Donald Trump not to get involved in the election campaign ahead of the US president’s trip to the UK.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives will be wary of any endorsements or comments on Brexit from Mr Trump during the visit, starting nine days before the public goes to the polls on December 12.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was asked on Friday about the president’s unprecedented intervention when he gave his backing to the Prime Minister and urged him to form a pact with Nigel Farage.</p>

      <p>“When you have close friends and allies like the US and the UK, the best thing is for neither side to get involved in each other’s election campaign,” Mr Johnson told LBC radio.</p>
      <p>The president is set to visit Buckingham Palace for a reception on Tuesday, before he joins world leaders during a Nato summit in Watford the following day.</p>
      <p>Asked during a press conference if he would meet specifically with Mr Trump, the PM replied: “I’m obviously going to be hosting the Nato leaders’ meeting and look forward to meeting all the Nato heads of government coming to that meeting.”</p>
      <p>The president last month hailed Mr Johnson as “the exact right guy for the times” and warned that Jeremy Corbyn would take the UK to “bad places”.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump did have some criticism for Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal, claiming it hinders trade with the US.</p>
      <p>In a proposal rejected by the Tories, the president also urged the PM to form an “unstoppable force” with the Brexit Party leader Mr Farage.</p>

      <p>Mr Trump’s visit will come as Labour warns that the NHS will be “up for sale” to US corporations in a post-Brexit trade deal under the Tories.</p>
      <p>Party leader Mr Corbyn has revealed a 451-page dossier he claims is “proof” the health service is on the table, but Mr Johnson has rejected this as “nonsense”.</p>
