      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson's</a> father believes that you are illiterate.</p>
      <p>In an interview today he responded to criticism of his son by questioning the public's literacy skills.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show, Stanley Johnson was quizzed about his eldest son's integrity.</p>

      <p>Derbyshire said: "Another point made in the comments from viewers was somebody calling your son Pinocchio."</p>
      <p>The former MEP replied: "That requires a degree of literacy which I think the Great British public doesn't necessarily have."</p>
      <p>Seeming surprised the host responded: "What do you mean by that?"</p>
      <p>"I am not going to get into that," he replied seemingly trying to row back from his comments.</p>
      <p>He was pushed further with Victoria Derbyshire asking: "Well that is quite a pejorative thing to say about the Great British public."</p>
      <p>All pretense at diplomacy abandoned, he said: "They couldn't spell Pinocchio if they tried I should have thought."</p>
      <p>Derbyshire responded: "Why would you say that?" with Johnson replying: "Well can you spell Pinocchio?"</p>
      <p>Victoria Derbyshire added: "Whether I can or not I don't think it is something to be critical of."</p>

      <p>Stanley Johnson, who had previously voted remain, said: "I go back to what I was said before and I was trying to say it in a humorous way.</p>
      <p>"I think that it is utterly absurd and wrong that you can read out on air a tweet which calls the Prime Minister a liar, I think it is amazing you can do that."</p>
      <p>People have reacted angrily to the comments:</p>
