      <p>The Zimbabwe Republic Police have blocked protesting lawyers from entering the police headquarters where they wanted to submit a petition in protest to police brutality against civilians.</p>
      <p>The protest comes after police, fearing anarchy, unleashed violence on MDC supporters who were gathered at Morgan Tsvangirai House last week in Harare where MDC leader, Nelson Chamisa was delivering his Hope of the Nation Address.</p>
