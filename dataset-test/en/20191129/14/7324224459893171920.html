      <h1>Wolves comment: No need for Arsenal-linked Nuno to go</h1>
      <h2>There is no reason for Nuno Espirito Santo to leave Wolves – a club he has made such an indelible mark on.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:03:18+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>After all, the project is far from finished. It is only just getting started. There are no limits as to what Wolves can achieve, as Nuno said earlier this week.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, his side are fifth in the Premier League table. Quite a few people thought the rigours of the Europa League would come at a cost and impact the league form.</p>
      <p>Instead, Wolves have thrived, in both, with passage to the Europa last 32 sealed with a game to spare in Group K.</p>
      <p>Last season, of course, was ever-so impressive. Finishing seventh in the Premier and making it to the FA Cup semi-finals on the back of promotion from the Championship as title-winners was remarkable.</p>
      <p>But, really, the second season is where it counts – to fully prove the first was no fluke – and Wolves have passed the test with top grades so far. It does not seem like they are going to veer off the exciting path they are on anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Nuno is the man at the forefront of it all.</p>
      <p>It is not only down to him – the players, owners, recruitment staff, medical team and fans have all been playing a big part in proceedings too.</p>
      <p>But the Portuguese is the one who has united the club.</p>
      <p>It is his footballing philosophy which has been brought into from top to bottom – from the first team, through all academy age groups.</p>
      <p>His idea of operating with a small squad, a risky tactic, has paid dividends.</p>
      <p>He is the one building genuine stars – Raul Jimenez, Ruben Neves and Adama Traore to name a few. So, why give that all up?</p>
      <p>If all that can be achieved in two and a half years in charge, think what could be done another three or four down the line.</p>
      <p>Grabbing some silverware in that time – an FA Cup or the Europa crown – is not an unrealistic target either.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, no doubt, are a massive club with outstanding global appeal. It is an attractive job, despite the troubles they have had at boardroom level and largely-average squad they now have.</p>
      <p>But Nuno is adored at Wolves, and he genuinely admires the supporters.</p>
      <p>He is at the forefront of everything the club does too. You have to think it would not be the same with the Gunners.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Braga before Wolves' draw there on Thursday, Nuno did not completely quash the speculation.</p>
      <p>But his tone and body language came across as him being committed to the gold and black cause, keen to build on the immense success he has already overseen.</p>
      <p>Nuno had a dream, and it has become a reality. Surely, it has to continue as he and Wolves are a match made in heaven.</p>
