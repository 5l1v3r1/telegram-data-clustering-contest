      <p>The 19-year-old winger was named on the bench for Dortmund's away loss to FC Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday, after he reportedly arrived late for a team briefing and training session in the build-up to the game.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time Sancho has been reprimanded for an indiscretion, which has reportedly led to a massive breakdown in the relationship between the player and the club's management.</p>
      <p>In October, the Manchester City academy product was handed a suspension by the club for returning late from international duty.</p>

      <p>According to <i>The Independent</i>, Dortmund's board promised the player and his agent they would give him his wish by selling him at the end of the season, and are now reportedly furious with the way he has acted.</p>
      <p>Due to his disciplinary issues, the club's board are now said to be prepared to cash in on the star in the January transfer window, with United and Liverpool interested. Previous reports have suggested that BVB value Sancho at about £100 million (R1.8 billion).</p>
