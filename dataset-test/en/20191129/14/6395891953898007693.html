      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - An influential group representing the German auto industry has chosen Hildegard Mueller, who was once a senior aide to Chancellor Angela Merkel, as its new leader.</p>
      <p>The German Association of the Automotive Industry, or VDA, announced the appointment on Friday. Mueller said in a statement that "the auto industry is the backbone of the German economy."</p>
      <p>Mueller will replace Bernhard Mattes, who is stepping down at the end of the year.</p>
