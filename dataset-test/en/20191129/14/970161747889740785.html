      <p>Remember being a kid and creating a fort with bed sheets and a lamp? It was the most magical thing ever.</p>
      <p>And one mum has taken the humble fort to the next level by creating an incredible hideaway for her little girl in the dead space under the eaves in her loft.</p>
      <p>Sara Tasker set about creating a magical, private space for her daughter, Orla, to snuggle up, watch her favourite shows or read her books.</p>

      <p>The social media expert was having building work done to create an extra bedroom on the top floor of her home, when she realised that there was some dead space underneath the eaves.</p>

      <p>‘It was going to be a cupboard and I thought, what if we made it something magical instead?’ Sara tells Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>‘When I was little, a friend’s dad had built her a mini hideout in her bedroom and I always dreamed of having something similar.’</p>

      <p>We don’t blame her. The hideaway is wood-panelled all the way around, it has soft fairy lights embedded in the ceiling and the floor is heaped with piles of fluffy cushions and throws. There’s even a little shelf for Orla to prop up a screen to watch TV. It even has a little door with a stylish rope handle.</p>
      <p>‘Our joiner thought I was joking,’ says Sara. ‘Even after I’d explained it all, he didn’t believe we actually wanted it including.</p>
      <p>‘But then he got really into it and made a perfect little door to go with it. It’s not cost us any extra, just a few pounds for more wood.’</p>

      <p>Orla was, understandably, delighted.</p>
      <p>‘We didn’t tell Orla until it was basically done,’ Sara adds. ‘We filled it with fairy lights and blankets and let her open the door herself. She couldn’t speak for the first few minutes, she was so excited!’</p>

      <p>Now, how do we get one of these for under our desks at work?</p>
