      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> got a shock this morning (29.11.19) when host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/ben-shephard/?page=3">Ben Shephard</a> wore a kilt.</p>
      <p>Ben, 44, was wearing a kilt in honour of Lorraine Kelly's 60th birthday.</p>
      <p>But guest Adrian Edmondson got the biggest shock of all when Ben flashed him during their interview.</p>

      <p>The larks started when attention turned to Lorraine's birthday celebrations.</p>
      <p>"I'm always keen to celebrate anyone's birthday," Ben said.</p>
      <aside>I do have a little outfit for her. I don't want to ruin the surprise.</aside>
      <p>"I have a hand in it. I do have a little outfit for her. I don't want to ruin the surprise."</p>
      <p>With Lorraine waiting in the wings not knowing what was going to happen, and Ben managing to squeeze in an outfit change during an ad break, he began to interview ex-EastEnders and The Young Ones legend Ade.</p>
      <p>That's when he got an eyeful he wasn't bargaining on.</p>

      <p>"It's rising up quite shockingly," Ade chuckled, referencing Ben's kilt.</p>

      <p>"Rise and shine they say," Ben replied, laughing.</p>
      <p>"This is the outfit. The birthday suit. I would only ever wear it in an authentic way."</p>
