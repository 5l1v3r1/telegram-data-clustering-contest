      <h1>Arsenal sack Emery: Five things next Gunners boss must address</h1>

        <b>The next Arsenal boss has a host of pressing issues to address when he steps into the role vacated by Unai Emery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unai Emery paid the price for Arsenal’s stuttering form on Friday but his dismissal alone will not fix the club’s problems.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are in danger of finishing outside the top four for a fourth consecutive season, with the gap already eight points.</p>
      <p>Emery himself had matters to address when he succeeded Arsene Wenger in May 2018, though it appears he made little headway on that front.</p>
      <p>Whoever follows in the Spaniard’s footsteps must act with more haste to deal with a growing list of concerns that are holding back a club once seen as perennial Premier League title challengers.</p>
      <p>Here we take a look at the most pressing areas to focus on for whoever takes the helm at the Emirates Stadium.</p>

        <b>DEFENSIVE WOES HAVE GOT TO GO</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gunners once boasted perhaps the most well-drilled back-line in English football, but the same cannot be said of the current crop.</p>
      <p>What is clear, however, is that Arsenal’s defensive issues – a phrase that somewhat undersells the extent of their troubles – extend beyond the defence itself.</p>
      <p>Emery’s Arsenal lacked shape, discipline, awareness and, it must be said, desire. Players often seemed lost, while opponents found and exploited space with ease.</p>
      <p>And it was not just without the ball that Arsenal’s defensive frailties were exposed, as on numerous occasions their attempts to play out from the back were thwarted by a loose touch or stray pass.</p>
      <p>With just 10 clean sheets in 51 top-flight matches under Emery, the next incumbent must devise a system to reverse that alarming trend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PUT A CAP ON CAPTAINS TALLY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emery had nine different captains. Nine. By any reckoning that is too many and it speaks to the general lack of cohesion under his reign.</p>
      <p>It developed into such a farce that in what proved to be Emery’s final game in charge at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang appeared to forget he was captain and did not present himself for the pre-match coin toss until prompted by officials.</p>
      <p>The new guy has to show his decisiveness by picking a captain and sticking with him.</p>
      <p>It may be the perfect time to wipe the slate clean with Granit Xhaka and give him the armband, or maybe the apparently forgetful Aubameyang would prove a more popular choice.</p>
      <p>Either way, make a choice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KEEP AUBAMEYANG AND OTHER TOP TALENT HAPPY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite their struggles, Arsenal boast players who many of their Premier League rivals would dearly love to have on their books.</p>
      <p>Chief among them is Aubameyang, who has proven a reliable source of goals since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in January last year.</p>
      <p>Such exploits, allied with Arsenal’s relative under-performance, have put him firmly on the radar of potential suitors.</p>
      <p>With reports circulating that Aubameyang is stalling on contract talks in London, assuaging his concerns must sit high on the to-do list of Arsenal’s next manager.</p>
      <p>Keeping the Gabon international on board might also provide a boost for other flagging stars, like Alexandre Lacazette and Mesut Ozil.</p>

        <b>PEPE PEP TALK</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking of top talent, the case of Nicolas Pepe is a curious one that needs solving fast.</p>
      <p>He surpassed Aubameyang as Arsenal’s most expensive signing when he joined from Lille in August, but has failed to fire so far.</p>
      <p>With one league goal to his name, the full value of what Pepe has to offer has not come close to being realised.</p>
      <p>But if that potential can be unlocked, Arsenal will have another tremendous goalscoring threat at their disposal.</p>
      <p>A Pepe pep talk should be among the first duties of the Gunners’ incoming boss.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CONNECT WITH THE FANS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The frustration among Arsenal’s fan base has long been felt, preceding even the arrival of Emery.</p>
      <p>For a while under Wenger there was a widespread perception the club lacked ambition and direction, with few signs of positive change to cling to.</p>
      <p>The incident with Xhaka – reacting with disgust to jeers from the stands and consequently being frozen out until Thursday’s Europa League loss – marked a low point in the relationship between the fans and their team.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, results will be speak loudest in making a connection with the faithful, but a manager who can take on the burden of their anger and work towards appeasing it will be well received in the north of the capital.</p>
      <p>He must also be able to manage upwards, knowing much of the unrest among supporters relates to the way the club is run at boardroom level.</p>
