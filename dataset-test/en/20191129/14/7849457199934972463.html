      <p>The crew members and the distressed vessel have been drifting off Siaton Point waters in Negros Oriental when they were found by rescuers at about 7 a.m. on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Investigation showed that the barge, MB Tamban, was anchored off Sibulan when it was dragged due to strong currents in the area at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. It was only after almost two days that the crew was able to seek the help of the PCG.</p>
      <p>According to the Coast Guard, the report came in at 2 a.m. of Thursday, prompting them to deploy the BRP Suluan, a multi-Rrle response vessel (MRRV) 4406, which was docked at Cagayan de Oro for a regular maritime patrol, to rescue the men, who have been drifting off Siaton.</p>
      <p>“BRP Suluan was conducting its regular maritime patrol when it was alerted about the drifting of said barge since night of November 26,” the Coast Guard said in a report Friday.</p>
      <p>The crew members were all rescued around 6:30 a.m. Thursday while MB Tamban was towed and safely anchored at Dapitan Bay at around 7 p.m. of the same day.</p>
      <p>No one was reported hurt during the incident, the Coast Guard said.</p>
