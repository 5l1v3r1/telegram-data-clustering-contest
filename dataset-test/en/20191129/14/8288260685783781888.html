      <p>A man has been detained by police and number of people have been injured following a stabbing near London Bridge, the Metropolitan Police said.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police said: "Police were called at 1.58pm to a stabbing at premises near to London Bridge. Emergency services attended, including officers from the Met and @colp A man has been detained by police. We believe a number of people have been injured. Further info to follow.</p>
      <p>"We are aware of reports circulating on social media. We will release facts when we can - our info must be accurate."</p>
      <p>British Transport Police said London Bridge station has been closed.</p>
      <p>The force tweeted: "We are aware of an incident at #LondonBridge and are assisting our colleagues at @metpoliceuk. London Bridge station is currently closed and trains are none stopping. Please check with @metpoliceuk for further updates."</p>
      <p>Police have evacuated London Bridge station and the surrounding area amid reports of shots being fired.</p>
      <p>A cordon has been set up at Borough Market while evacuation continues from nearby shops and businesses.</p>
      <p>Response from officers led scores of people to run down St Thomas' street, though the exact cause of the incident is still unknown.</p>
      <p>Kelby McNally, OK! Online's editor, works in the Northern and Shell Building on Lower Thames Street near to London Bridge.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was coming out of Pret on Eastcheap and there were loads of people just running, I thought it was a fire alarm or something, and then I saw two girls from my office who told me not to go back there. I asked what had happened, and they said they had heard gunshots and now everyone is running.</p>
      <p>"City of London police officers and paramedics told us, 'You need to go that way, do not go near London Bridge, run that way'.</p>
      <p>"Everyone was running, so then we came to where the Sky Garden building is and the security guards let everyone in. We're sat in the foyer of this building, and everyone is running outside. Now everyone is being let out of this building but they're saying you cannot walk back towards London Bridge, go towards Liverpool Street."</p>
      <p>Another video posted to social media showed a man, apparently the suspect, grappling with some other men.</p>
      <p>As he tried to get up from the floor, he then collapsed to the ground after being hit by what appeared to be gunfire.</p>
