      <p>WORKING in partnership with Mayo County Council, Irish Water has completed a detailed assessment of the water treatment plants in Mayo as part of the National Disinfection Programme.</p>
      <p>This programme has resulted in upgrades and standardisation of disinfection systems at 22 plants to ensure continued delivery of safe drinking water to customers in Mayo, while also maintaining security of supply and sustained compliance with the drinking water regulations.</p>
      <p>As part of the project, operational upgrades have been completed at 22 water treatment plants and reservoirs throughout the county, including Westport (Knappagh), Ballinrobe, Inishturk, Clare Island, Achill, Kiltimagh, Ballina Wherrew, Foxford, Kilkelly, Louisburgh, Boniconlon, Ceide Fields, Charlestown, Crossmolina, Swinford, Erris, Mulranny, Knock Airport, Newport, Ballina Lisglennon, Tallagh Towers and Attavally (Bangor) Reservoir.</p>
      <p>Glan Agua Limited carried out the work on behalf of Irish Water.</p>
      <p>Martin Temple, Irish Water, stated: “The protection of public health and continued delivery of safe, clean drinking water is the top priority for Irish Water. Water comes from a variety of sources, including underground aquifers, rivers and streams. However, this raw water must undergo a thorough and complex treatment process before it is safe to drink. This includes disinfection to remove potentially harmful bacteria from the raw water which could cause illness if consumed.</p>
      <p>“Having appropriate treatment in place is essential to provide the public with good quality, safe and secure supply of drinking water. This project will ensure we continue to comply with the drinking water regulations and provide residents and businesses with the peace of mind that comes from knowing the water that comes from their taps has been treated to a very high standard.”</p>
      <p>Irish Water is investing over €65 million as part of the National Disinfection Programme across the country. This programme involves assessing 864 public drinking water treatment plants, pumping stations and reservoirs, and carrying out upgrades and standardising the disinfection systems.</p>
      <p>To date, Irish Water have assessed 805 sites and completed upgrade works to over 211 sites nationwide.</p>
