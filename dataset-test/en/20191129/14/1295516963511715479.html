      <p>Less than a month ahead of the film's release, IMAX shared exclusive artwork for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>Star Wars:</i> <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>.</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/IMAX/status/1200444306298945536?s=20">Twitter</a>, the artwork's release was accompanied by an announcement, which read, "Check out the IMAX exclusive artwork for <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>! Don’t wait to get your IMAX tickets, experience the epic conclusion to the Skywalker saga that’s over 40 years in the making. See it in IMAX theatres Dec 20."</p>

      <p>Shaded in blues and reds, the artwork centers around Rey, who stands on a rock ledge against a starry sky. Two major figures loom behind her: General Leia Organa and her son Kylo Ren, the Supreme Leader of the First Order. Leia and Rey look out in opposite directions, while Kylo Ren's helmet faces forward. His mask -- repaired through a style comparable to the Japanese art of Kintsugi -- is veined with a red light. His long, black hair escapes on one side. The mask blends into the nose and chin of Luke Skywalker.</p>

      <p>Some fans believe a subtle image of Darth Vader lurks in the background, formed by the swirling stars just below Kylo Ren on the right side of the artwork. At the time of writing, it is unclear if this is true and it has not been confirmed by Lucasfilm, but it would certainly make sense. After all, <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> is purported to be the end of the Skywalker Saga, which began with Anakin Skywalker, continued through his children Luke and Leia and will conclude with his grandson Kylo Ren.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives on Dec. 20.</p>
