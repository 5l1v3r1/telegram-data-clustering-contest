      <p>It was announced on Friday morning that the club are planning to add a further 7,000 seats to Anfield with a £60 million redevelopment of the Anfield Road end to bring the capacity up to 61,000.</p>
      <p>This is an ambitious and very welcome outlook, which along with the new training ground in Kirkby and a high-profile kit deal with Nike will reflect the Reds’ success on the pitch.</p>
      <p>While it remains a long time until work could get underway at Anfield—with a new planning application expected in spring next year—Klopp spoke of his excitement at the news.</p>
      <p>“It’s really early stages, so I don’t even know exactly what I’m allowed to say, or what I can say,” he told reporters at Melwood on Friday.</p>
      <p>“I saw pictures of it, obviously, it looks really good, to be honest, that’s nice. But very early, very early stages.</p>
      <p>“The best news is—nobody knows if it will happen, when it will happen exactly—but the news is this club is constantly trying to develop and make the next steps.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I like about the news, really. Making this iconic place available for more people is a very good idea.</p>
      <p>“It could have been mine—it’s not mine but it could have been!</p>

      <p>“So it’s really exciting, but nobody knows exactly how long it will take or whatever.</p>
      <p>“But the plans are in our mind and that’s a good start.”</p>
      <p>Klopp is right to point towards the club as upwardly mobile, with the £114 million expansion of the Main Stand one of the first steps before Kirkby, Nike and the Anfield Road end.</p>
      <p>It is a credit to Fenway Sports Group that this has been possible approaching what will be a decade since they took over Liverpool next October.</p>
