      <p>LONDON — British police said Friday they were dealing with an incident on London Bridge, and witnesses have reported hearing gunshots.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police force tweeted that officers were “in the early stages of dealing with an incident at London Bridge.”</p>
      <p>BBC reporter John McManus was in the area and said he saw figures grappling on the bridge. He said: “I thought it was initially a fight,” but then shots rang out.</p>
      <p>London Ambulance Service said it had crews on the scene.</p>
      <p>Police could be seen ushering people away from the northern end of the bridge, which links the city’s business district with the south bank of the River Thames.</p>
      <p>City of London Police, the force responsible for the business district, urged people to stay away from the area.</p>
      <p>London Bridge was the scene of a 2017 attack when Islamic State-inspired attackers ran down people on the bridge, killing two, before stabbing several people to death in nearby Borough Market.</p>
