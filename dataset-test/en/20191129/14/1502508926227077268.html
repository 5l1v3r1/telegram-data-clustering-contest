      <p>India’s annual growth in gross domestic product in the July-September quarter of FY20 declined to 4.5%, compared with 7.1 per cent in the same quarter last year, government data showed on Friday. This was the lowest level for GDP growth since of January-March quarter of FY13.</p>
      <p>The low rate of expansion was mainly on account of a weak manufacturing, subdued farm sector activity, and a drop in exports due to a global slowdown.</p>
      <p>According to the data released by the National Statistics Office, growth in gross value added, or GVA, in the manufacturing sector contracted by 1 per cent in the September quarter, compared with an expansion of 6.9 per cent last year.</p>
