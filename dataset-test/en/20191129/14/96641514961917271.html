      <h1>Garmin's Forerunner 645 (a staff favorite) is 50 percent off at Amazon</h1>

      <p>As you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/22/engadget-deals-hub-black-friday-2019/">may have heard</a>, Team Engadget is spending some time this week perusing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/blackfriday2019/">Black Friday deals</a>. I was sifting through some sales today, and it turns out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/16/the-best-gps-running-watches-for-2019/">my favorite running watch</a> received a temporary price cut. In fact, I'm wearing it on my wrist as I type this. At full price ($400) I might not have recommended the Garmin Forerunner 645/645 Music to everyone; I probably would have suggested most people step down to the mid-range <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Advanced-Dynamics/dp/B07QG3Z9N2/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=83e6043bccea33758e91ec3ad9d03d0d&amp;creativeASIN=B07QG3Z9N2">245</a>. But with a price drop today <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Contactless-Payments-Wrist-Based/dp/B078J6795M/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=c9ada93cf26904e9d93b82b49e1a15e7&amp;creativeASIN=B078J6795M">to $200</a>, the higher-end model suddenly becomes much easier to recommend than it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/11/garmin-forerunner-645-music-review/">when we first reviewed it</a>.</p>
      <p>Like any Garmin (or GPS watch from any brand, for that matter), it'll track your distance, pace and elapsed time. Here, you also get built-in music storage allowing you to stream through wireless headphones, without the need to bring a phone. (Or, in my case, clip on an iPod shuffle that's on its last legs.) There's also a heart rate sensor built in (no need for one of those uncomfortable chest straps) and features that monitor your training in a more long-term sort of way, including V02 Max ratings, workout loads and a so-called performance status. This is a good way to confirm what I often already know: that I'm over- or under-training.</p>
      <p>As for battery life, I've completed five-hour-plus marathons with plenty of juice to spare. The design has been durable enough for many a run in the rain. The distance tracking is also more accurate than the last several generations of Apple Watches. (Apple Watches tend to say I ran longer than I did, which means my calculated pace is also faster than what I probably achieved.) The Forerunner has admittedly been slow at times to find a GPS signal before I start my run, though a recent firmware update seems to have improved things.</p>
      <p>There are some more smartwatch-like features on board, but that's not why I recommend this. I never use Garmin Pay, the contactless payment system. And the smartphone notifications are crude and unhelpful. If you want a smartwatch experience (not to mention, something that looks a little more stylish that Garmin's rubbery watches), get an Apple Watch Series 5. (Yes, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XR5TRSZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07XR5TRSZ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=cc5087911dd04b329854ee97a531e723">that's on sale today too</a>.)</p>
