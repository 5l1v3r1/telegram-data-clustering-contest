      <p>The BSE on Friday said state-owned <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ntpc">NTPC </a>has made an application to list commercial papers on the stock exchange for an issue size of Rs 1,500 crore.</p>
      <p>After the process, the effective date of listing of such papers at the exchange will be December 2, the BSE said in a statement.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, non-banking financial company Aditya Birla Finance Ltd (ABFL) became the first company to list CP on the two exchanges BSE and NSE.</p>
      <p>The move came after the exchanges came out with a framework for listing of CPs in a bid to broaden investors' participation in such securities.</p>
      <p>CP is an unsecured money market instrument issued in the form of promissory notes that enable highly rated corporate borrowers to diversify their sources of short-term borrowings and provides an additional instrument to investors.</p>
      <p>Commercial papers can be issued for maturities between a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of up to one year from the date of issue. CP are usually issued at a discount from face value and reflects prevailing market interest rates.</p>
