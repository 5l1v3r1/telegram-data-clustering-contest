      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/noel-fielding/">Noel Fielding</a> has slammed both Labour and the Tories just weeks before the General Election.</p>
      <p>The star has recently been stressing the importance of saving the NHS after sharing a video of Rob Delaney talking about its benefits – not that we needed reminding, right?</p>
      <p>But it seems the 46-year-old is still struggling to pick who to place his all-important tick next to on 12 December.</p>
      <p>Don’t worry Noel, you still have 13 days left to decide.</p>
      <p>In a now-deleted tweet, the father-of-one wrote this his followers: ‘I mean I would love to vote but who the f**k for? It’s like choosing between a cup of warm urine and a s*** sandwich.’</p>

      <p>Shortly after he got rid of his post, the comedian then shared another featuring a South Park gif of the characters voting in the ‘Offical Mascot Ballot 2004.’</p>

      <p>The options were a ‘Giant Douche’, or a ‘Turd Sandwich.’</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to comment and told the star how they were not sad, just ‘disappointed’ in his tweet.</p>
      <p>‘Noel, stop it. One wants to end poverty in society, the other wants to continue with the norm. Stop it,’ one wrote while another said: ‘You shared @robdelaney ’s video. Watch it again until you realise how daft this tweet was.’</p>

      <p>Someone else shared a sad face emoji, as they added: ‘Disappointed in a tweet like this coming from u (sic).’</p>
      <p>And it seems Noel isn’t the only A-lister pondering over what to do with their ballot paper, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/liam-payne-doesnt-sound-certain-hell-vote-election-thinks-will-11234353/">as Liam Payne has recently revealed his uncertainty.</a></p>
      <p>When asked for his thoughts on choosing between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn next month, the 26-year-old said: ‘I think I will vote but I am always out of the country.</p>
      <p>‘We need a mobile app where we can vote with our thumbprint or something. I mean, in regards to Boris or Jeremy, I don’t think we give people enough time.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gq-hype/article/liam-payne-interview-2019">He told GQ Magazine</a>: ‘Same with West Brom football club. They always change their manager every week it seems and we never get time to gel with anybody.</p>

      <p>‘So it’s like, if I was changing my manager every week, I’d probably be really s**t too. We need to give someone a chance to at least have a proper go of it or it will never be fixed.’</p>
