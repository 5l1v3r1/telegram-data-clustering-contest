      <p>CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia said the commission has honored Magno’s courage and bravery for selflessly responding to the call of duty even in the face of certain death.</p>
      <p>“It is truly heartbreaking that we lost another dedicated police officer and a hero who stayed faithful to his mandate of serving and protecting the people,’’ de Guia said.</p>
      <p>With another senseless death, de Guia called on warring groups to put down their arms and spare the innocent from their violent acts stressing lives should not be wasted in any form of unnecessary brutality.</p>
      <p>The CHR said that Magno’s actions were worth emulating citing this would restore the public’s faith in the police forces given the recent unsavory controversies and alleged corrupt acts involving cops.</p>
      <p>“We express our deepest condolences to the family, colleagues, and friends of Police Master Sergeant Magno and hopes for the speedy recovery of the policewoman and students who were hurt in the grenade blast,’’ the CHR said.</p>
      <p>Although local authorities have identified the suspect, the CHR has called a more intense probe on the incident to identify the mastermind and determine the motive behind the brutal attack. (Chito A. Chavez)</p>
