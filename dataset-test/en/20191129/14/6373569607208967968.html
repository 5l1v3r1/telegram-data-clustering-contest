      <p>Four Royal Navy sailors have got a date at Buckingham Palace with Her Majesty the Queen, after being recognised for their heroic deeds on the front line.</p>
      <p>Personnel from all three Services have been singled out for bravery, dedication and effort above and beyond what would normally be expected of them, in the second Operational Honours list of the year.</p>
      <p>The bravery of two former crew mates from Plymouth based Type 23 frigate HMS Argll – sea boat coxswain Leading Seaman David Groves and his bowman Able Seaman Alex Harvey – is acknowledged with the award of the Queen’s Gallantry Medal and Queen’s Commendation for Bravery respectively.</p>
      <p>Commander Mike Carter-Quinn, now at FOST in Plymouth, receives an OBE for his time in charge of destroyer HMS Dragon. <br/><br/>And Leading Medical Assistant Gemma Brown gets the Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service for delivering trauma and first-aid instruction in Iraq.</p>
