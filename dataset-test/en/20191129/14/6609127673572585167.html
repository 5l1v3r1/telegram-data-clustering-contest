        <b>SCOTLAND are in a very good position to finish inside UEFA top 15, according to stats guru Dale Johnson.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ESPN FC editor, who <a href="https://twitter.com/DaleJohnsonESPN">specialises in permutations and coefficients</a>, claims Celtic and Rangers just need <b>TWO</b> wins between them to be 'almost certain' of staying in the top 15.</p>

      <p>Another solid night in Europe for the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5009304/rangers-ibrox-closure-fans-sectarian-chants-feyenoord/">Light Blues</a> has moved Scotland up the rankings into the coveted 15th position.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon's men recorded a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5008167/celtic-3-rennes-0-hoops-top-europa-league-group/">3-1 win over Rennes</a> while Steven Gerrard and Co picked up a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5007741/feyenoord-2-rangers-2-europa-league/">2-2 draw with Feyenoord in Rotterdam</a>.</p>
      <p>Finishing in our current ranking spot or above at the end of the season would guarantee <b>TWO</b> Champions League places and keep any Europa League places for the 2021-22 season.</p>
      <p>But how do we go around achieving this? Johnson explained the possible scenarios outlined below.</p>

      <p>Scotland are now within just two wins of Czech Republic, which will have no teams left in Europe after the group stages end.</p>
      <p>Slavia Prague have one more game to play in the Champions League away to Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Denmark - who sit 13th - still have Copenhagen competing in European competition and they are on course to reach the knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Johnson claims two wins and a draw between the Old Firm could see Scotland leapfrog Denmark in the rankings too.</p>

      <p>Celtic have at least <b>THREE</b> more games in European competition after securing their last 32 spot while Rangers have it all in their own hands heading into the final round of group games.</p>
      <p>But can Scotland be knocked out of 15th spot before the end of the season?</p>
      <p>Well, Cyprus currently sit just one draw behind Scotland - APOEL have reached the knockout stages of the UEL and remain a danger.</p>
      <p>Greece rank 17th but are three wins behind Scotland with Olympiakos requiring a win at home to Red Star to remain in Europe beyond Christmas.</p>
      <p>Serbia are also still a threat. Partizan have been eliminated from the Europa League but have one final fixture against Astana.</p>
      <p>Crvena zvezda (Red Star) may be knock out of Europe all together - but they could still end up in the Europa League last 32 if they defeat Olympiakos in Greece.</p>
      <p>Scotland's coefficent would be further boosted by victories in the last round of Europa League fixtures.</p>
      <p>Rangers need a result against Young Boys to qualify for the next stage - and victory would ensure a top place finish in Group G.</p>
      <p>Celtic are already through as group winners but a win over Cluj in Romania would go a long way towards securing the coveted 15th position.</p>
