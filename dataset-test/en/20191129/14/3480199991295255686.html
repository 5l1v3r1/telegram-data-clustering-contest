      <p>Boris Johnson’s father has accused the British public of being unable to spell “Pinocchio” after his son was accused of being like the famed puppet.</p>
      <p>In the story, the wooden puppet Pinocchio’s nose grows longer whenever he tells a lie.</p>
      <p>Standing in on the Victoria Derbyshire Show, host Joanna Gosling read out a message to Stanley Johnson which referred to his son as being like “Pinocchio”.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, a former Conservative MEP, retorted: “Pinocchio, that requires a degree of literacy which I think the Great British public doesn’t necessarily have.”</p>
      <p>Asked what he meant by that, he said: “I’m not going to get into that,” adding: “They couldn’t spell Pinocchio if they tried, I would have thought.”</p>
      <p>Ms Gosling then asked: “Why would you say that?” and Mr Johnson replied: “Well can you spell Pinocchio?”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, who appeared on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here in 2017, added: “I’ll go back to what I said before, I think it is utterly absurd and wrong that you can read out on air a tweet, from one of your readers, on air, which calls the Prime Minister a liar.</p>
      <p>“I think it is amazing you can do that. Amazing.”</p>

      <p>He was later asked about an article in the Spectator from 1995 where the Prime Minister wrote the words “ill-raised, ignorant and aggressive” about single mothers.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: “Hang on, whose record are we talking about … we’re talking about a column in the Spectator written, according to you, in 1995.</p>
      <p>“I have a great collection of books written by Boris. I have a collection of books which I have written, 25 altogether.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure there’s some things in those books – for example, I once wrote a book about birth control where I attacked the Pope and I called him ‘the greatest hazard to humanity’ because of the line he has taken on birth control.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure in a political campaign that would be brought up against me. This is all nonsense.”</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister’s father accompanied Tory senior frontbencher Michael Gove to the Channel 4 climate change debate on Thursday evening and was filmed trying to persuade the production team to allow Mr Gove to take his son’s place.</p>
