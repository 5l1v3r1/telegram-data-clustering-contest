        <b>"The Taliban wants to make a deal and we're meeting with them and we're saying it has to be a ceasefire," Trump said during his recent visit to Afghanistan.</b>

      <p>The Taliban said Friday it was "way too early" to speak of resuming direct talks with Washington, a day after <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/taliban-wants-to-make-a-deal-trump-in-afghanistan-265151">President Donald Trump </a>suggested negotiations to end America's longest war were back on track during a surprise visit to Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>"It is way too early to talk about the resumption of talks for now. We will give our official reaction later," the Islamist group's official spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, told AFP in a WhatsApp message.</p>
      <p>Trump on Thursday had said the Taliban "wants to make a deal".</p>

      <p>"We're meeting with them and we're saying it has to be a ceasefire," he told reporters during his unannounced trip to Bagram Airfield, outside the capital Kabul, to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with the troops.</p>
      <p>His statement suggested progress after his shock decision in September to end negotiations with the insurgents just as Washington appeared on the verge of signing a deal with the Taliban that would have seen the US begin pulling troops out of Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.</p>
      <p>The deal was expected to pave a way towards direct talks between the Taliban and the government in Kabul.</p>
      <p>But Trump described the year-long effort as "dead" and withdrew an invitation to the insurgents to meet in the United States due to the killing of an American soldier.</p>
      <p>Both Washington and the Taliban had left the door open for talks to resume, however, with most observers agreeing that a political settlement is the only way to reach a lasting peace in Afghanistan after 18 years of war.</p>
