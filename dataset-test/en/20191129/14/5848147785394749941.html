      <h4>Thousands saving up to $430 on energy costs – compare today!</h4>
      <p>Affordable energy continues to be a top concern for many seniors and cost-wary Aussie battlers, with most households feeling the pressure of rising energy costs for several years.</p>
      <p>Recent changes to retailer pricing and advertising came into effect on July 1, 2019. These reforms had two main objectives:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reduce the rising costs for standing offers – the default electricity plans for consumers who don’t compare and save with market offers.</li>
        <li>Improve consumers’ ability to compare prices and identify the best deals across all market offers, which are contracts that can include discounts, sign-up incentives, and more competitive rates.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For consumers, this means shopping around can bring significant savings, especially with smaller energy companies. That’s why last month alone over 40,000 Aussies have used <a href="https://electricityandgas.com.au/form/stepn-tw-ab/?utm_source=thenewdaily&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredarticle&amp;utm_campaign=eng-december&amp;utm_content=ditching-big-companies-for-cheaper-local">ElectricityandGas.com.au</a> to compare and save on their energy costs. With these changes, some Aussies are finding that their costs have fallen by as much as $430.</p>

      <p>Customers who do <a href="https://electricityandgas.com.au/form/stepn-tw-ab/?utm_source=thenewdaily&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredarticle&amp;utm_campaign=eng-december&amp;utm_content=ditching-big-companies-for-cheaper-local">shop around and compare</a> should consider looking at smaller energy companies. A recent report by the ACCC found that smaller companies offer some of the best deals available.</p>
      <p>Almost a million Aussies have already saved on their electricity bills. The ACCC suggests most people can get additional savings by shopping around and comparing market offers with smaller retailers.</p>
      <p><b>If you’re not on a market offer energy plan, it’s likely that you might be paying the maximum a retailer can charge you for electricity.</b> With these changes, there’s no reason to keep overpaying on your energy bill due to the “loyalty tax” a lot of Aussies face by not comparing services.</p>
