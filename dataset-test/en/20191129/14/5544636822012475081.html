      <p>The co-founder and CEO of microblogging platform, Twitter, Jack Dorsey, says he would be relocating to Africa for a momentary stay in 2020.</p>
      <p>The American business mogul confirmed his plans of moving to the continent on Thursday through his handle in a farewell after having completed his planned trip to Africa.</p>
      <p>Dorsey, who recently left Nigeria, had visited four nations in the continent — including Ethiopia, Ghana, and South Africa — in November to “spend time with entrepreneurs.”</p>
      <p>During his visit to Nigeria, Dorsey met with entrepreneurs and young artists, as well as Twitter board member Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, an economist and former managing director of the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Dorsey didn’t precisely disclose what country he would choose to stay in but he confirmed that he would be living in “Africa for about 3 to 6 months in mid 2020”.</p>
      <p>“Sad to be leaving the continent for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid-2020. Grateful I was able to experience a small part.,” he wrote in a tweet.</p>
