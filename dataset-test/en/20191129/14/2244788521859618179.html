        <b>THE management of the Federal University of Lafia, Nasarawa has denied the expulsion of a male student for impregnating his lecturer, claiming there was no student that impregnated a lecturer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was <b><a href="https://www.nairaland.com/5551557/federal-university-lafia-expels-student">reported</a></b> that one Kelvin from the department of Computer Science of the University was expelled by the institution earlier this week for putting a female lecturer in the family way.</p>
      <p> Following the uproar that greeted the supposed expulsion of the student, Abubakar Ibrahim, the University’s Public Relations Officer,  said it was a rumour.</p>

      <p>Ibrahim said the news flying around was from the imagination of its writer which is tailored towards destroying the image of the school.</p>
      <p>“The attention of the Management of Federal University of Lafia (FULafia) has been drawn to a story which has gone viral on the social media to the effect that one “Kelvin,” said to be a student of Computer Science Department of FULafia, has impregnated a lecturer of the department.</p>
      <p> “This story cannot be further away from falsehood. Therefore, the management wishes to state categorically that the story is nothing but a fabrication by the writer, mischievous and aimed at destroying the good image and reputation of the Federal University of Lafia because no such incident has happened in the university,” he said.</p>
      <p>The institution called on the general public to “disregard the purported story” as it would continue to maintain a high moral standard in the university.</p>
