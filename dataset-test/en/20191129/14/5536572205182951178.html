      <h1>Michael Bennett Delivered Fiery Message To Teammates After Loss: ‘Only Champions Get Remembered’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:29:27+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Michael Bennett has been with the Cowboys organization for a total of 33 days, but he is one of few on the team who has the jewelry on his finger to do what he did after the game on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Following the blowout loss to the Buffalo Bills — Bennett was said to have been yelling at the top of his lungs well before all the players had made it back.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old was delivering a fiery speech that everybody on the team needed to hear.</p>
      <p>“The champions are the people that get remembered,” Bennett said when asked about his message, via <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/cowboys/2019/11/29/a-fiery-michael-bennett-had-this-message-for-his-cowboys-teammates-following-loss-to-the-bills/">Michael Gehlken of the Dallas Morning News.</a> “They don’t remember who got the biggest contract. A whole bunch of great players got great contracts, but they don’t get remembered as champions. Champions are the ones who get the gold plates and the jackets and they understand what it takes to win. That’s just a certain mindset. That’s just a certain ability to play tough in adverse moments.”</p>
      <p>An emotional Jerry Jones also spoke after the game.</p>
      <p>“Everybody in there that had anything to say have earned the right to say it,” Jones said. “You didn’t have anybody period that didn’t have the right to express themselves.”</p>
      <p>The Cowboys remain in first place in the NFC East despite a 6-6 record, and they have the Bears, Rams, Eagles and Washington remaining.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Dak Prescott stated Bennett’s message was well received.</p>
      <p>“It’s important that we understand that it’s a small window that we have,” Bennett said, via Gehlken. “We’ve got all the great players. The only thing we’ve got to do is execute in adversity. The enemy against greatness is the unwillingness to change. We’ve got to be able to change some of the things that we’ve been doing to demand more from ourselves and become the people we want to be.</p>
      <p>“Every opportunity is in front of us, but it’s just on us to capitalize. To win, you’ve got to sacrifice a lot. It’s going to hurt. It’s painful. You play through injury, but you do it because you have to. To win that championship, to win that Lombardi, there’s no feeling like that. And that takes a lot.”</p>
