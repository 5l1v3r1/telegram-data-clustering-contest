        <b>Arsenal interim head coach Freddie Ljungberg has pledged to give everything to the club he starred for as a player.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Freddie Ljungberg is keen to get Arsenal fans back on side as he begins his tenure as interim head coach.</p>
      <p>Club great Ljungberg was placed in temporary charge after Unai Emery was sacked on Friday, the former Sevilla and Paris Saint-Germain boss paying the price for a winless run of seven matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s 2-1 Europa League defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt saw a sparse Emirates Stadium crowd boo their team once more and Ljungberg knows a key part of his role is to bring back a semblance of a feelgood factor – starting with Sunday’s trip to Norwich City.</p>
      <p>“However long I oversee Arsenal for I will give everything I have to put smiles on faces again,” the former Sweden midfielder tweeted.</p>
      <p>“We have a busy few weeks ahead and the team needs your support. Let’s get to work!”</p>

      <p>Ljungberg was a star performer for Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal, representing the club between 1998 and 2007.</p>
      <p>He won two Premier League titles, scoring 12 times in 25 appearances as the Gunners tasted glory in 2001-02 before netting in a 2-0 FA Cup final triumph against Chelsea that season to complete the double.</p>
      <p>It was the first of three winners’ medals in the competition for Ljungberg, who also starred in Wenger’s celebrated “Invincibles” side, who marched to the 2003-04 Premier League crown without losing a single top-flight match.</p>
