      <h1>Las Vegas shoppers hitting stores early on Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/subrina-hudson/" target="_blank">Subrina Hudson</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday was less busy than usual at Fashion Show mall in the early hours.</p>
      <p>Lines formed for specialty stores such as Lululemon Athletica and Apple, but it wasn’t the rowdy scene that could have been expected a few years ago.</p>
      <p>Shoppers said the internet was largely to blame—or thank—for the relative calm. Many had already did the time-consuming portions of shopping online, price comparisons and browsing for deals.</p>
      <p>Best Buy’s North Decatur Boulevard store had long lines, but store workers say Thanksgiving Day was the real mad rush.</p>
      <p>The Retail Association of Nevada estimates roughly 1.65 million adults in the state will be shopping over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>The trade organization projects total spending to reach $593 million over the holiday weekend, a nearly 6 percent increase from a year earlier. The average Nevadan is predicted to spend $360, compared with last year’s average of $350.</p>
