      <p>Unai Emery's final weeks as Arsenal manager featured him being ruthlessly mocked by Gunners players, according to a report.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-players-unai-emery-sacked-a4300281.html?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1575029208">Evening Standard</a> claim that jokes about Emery's accent and broken English were commonplace at the club's London Colney base, with players also ridiculing his decision to name a captaincy group.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that a player said "how many captains to we have?" within earshot of Emery shortly after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had been appointed as the new Gunners skipper in place of Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>The decision to sack Emery was made earlier this week at a meeting of the Gunners' directors in US, although the Spaniard remained in charge for Thursday's Europa League group stage game with Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>

      <p>After <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> lost that match 2-1 at a hostile Emirates Stadium, the axe finally fell on Emery on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>"We announce today that the decision has been taken to part company with our head coach Unai Emery and his coaching team," read an Arsenal statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>"The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.</p>

      <p>"We have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach. We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward. <br/><br/>"The search for a new head coach is underway and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete."</p>

      <p>Emery wasn't a popular figure with many of his players by the end of his tenure, with his communication skills often cited as one of the key reasons behind his struggles.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg is seen as a steady hand to come in and take charge on an interim basis, and knows that he could be in like for the job permanently if he impresses.</p>
