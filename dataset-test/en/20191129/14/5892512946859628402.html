      <p>Aniah Blanchard, stepdaughter of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) heavyweight contender Walt Harris, was <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/27/20986205/aniah-blanchard-confirmed-dead-following-autopsy-report">kidnapped and murdered</a> last month, only to have her body dumped in the woods in rural Alabama.</p>
      <p>Three men have been arrested in connection with her disappearance, a family has been torn apart, and a community has been rocked. So many lives affected and for what? For absolutely nothing. Just another senseless killing.</p>
      <p>Harris penned an emotional reaction on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5aXd65pjA_/">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>“This pain is unbearable… I know you want me to be strong but it’s so hard baby, it’s so hard. I’m gonna find a way, I promise you, I will. Right now nothing makes sense and I’m so lost. I just want you back. I hope I made you proud… I’m gonna keep going, daddy just needs time. I love you so much. Look after us like you always did. We need you now more than ever. My lil mighty mighty tiger is a angel now. I love you baby girl forever and ever!”</p>
      <p>Read his full statement <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5aXd65pjA_/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The cause of death has not been released and the court has issued a media gag order until the preliminary hearing on Dec. 18. Ibraheem Yazeed, 30, is charged with kidnapping, while Antwon Fisher, 35, was arrested for providing transportation and disposing of evidence.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, David Johnson Jr. was charged with hindering prosecution and was released on bond; however, Yazeed and Fisher remain in custody based on their extensive criminal histories dating back several years.</p>
