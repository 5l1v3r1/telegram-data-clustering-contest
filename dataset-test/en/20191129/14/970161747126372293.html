      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chrissy-teigen/">Chrissy Teigen</a> proved herself as the world’s best wife (again) by surprising <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/john-legend/">John Legend</a> with some incredible pyjamas covered in his People Sexiest Man Alive cover.</p>
      <p>After being declared the sexiest man on the planet in the US magazine’s annual competition, Chrissy has endlessly joked with her husband of six years about his new title, even baiting last year’s winner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/idris-elba/">Idris Elba</a> on Twitter.</p>
      <p>But while spending Thanksgiving with their family and friends, the former Sports Illustrated covergirl decided to treat John to a hilarious surprise, as two of her friends dressed up in pyjamas covered in his People magazine cover.</p>

      <p>Seriously, we all need to get ourselves us a SO who stans us this hard.</p>
      <p>‘Uhh, yes, killing it,’ Chrissy told her friends as she prepared the surprise behind the scenes, adding: ‘Let’s do this’ before sneaking through to the dining room.</p>
      <p>Managing to catch John totally unawares, the All of Me singer found the whole thing hilarious, loudly laughing and clapping along with all their other guests, while Chrissy hollered: ‘Sexiest man, baby’.</p>

      <p>Despite having <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/10/john-legend-become-first-black-man-and-youngest-person-to-achieve-egot-status-after-winning-emmy-7929429/">already won plenty of awards in his time</a>, it’s fair to say that both John and Chrissy were a little surprised to see John receive the accolade, which has previously gone to Channing Tatum, Dwayne Johnson and David Beckham.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone’s going to be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/chrissy-teigen-comes-john-legend-hater-doesnt-approve-new-sexiest-man-alive-status-11123470/">picking me apart</a> to see if I’m sexy enough to hold this title,’ the 40-year-old dad of two told the title.</p>
      <p>‘I’m [also] following Idris Elba, which is not fair and is not nice to me!’</p>
      <p>However, Chrissy definitely saw the funny side, tweeting: ‘my secret is out. I have fulfilled my dream of having boned @people’s sexiest man alive!! an honor!!!!!’ and ‘the sexiest man alive just made me a ham sandwich.’</p>
