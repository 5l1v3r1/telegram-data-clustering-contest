      <h4>Microsoft Black Friday FAQs</h4>
      <h3>Does Microsoft have Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>Thankfully, yes. Microsoft will be having a range of Black Friday deals on all kinds of Microsoft hardware, and we’ve listed the best ones here.</p>
      <h3>Does the Microsoft Store have Black Friday sales?</h3>
      <p>While third-party stores might have their own deals on Microsoft devices, the Microsoft Store also has deals – and, they’re largely excellent and will be tough to match by third-party retailers.</p>
      <h3>How do I get the Microsoft student discount?</h3>
      <p>To get the Microsoft student discount, you’ll need to access the Microsoft Store straight through the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/r/student-discounts?wa=wsignin1.0">Microsoft Student and Military Discounts website</a>, log in, then hit the <i>Shop Now</i> button.</p>
      <h3>Will there be a Surface Book 3?</h3>
      <p>At this point, it’s unknown as to whether or not there will be a Microsoft Surface Book 3. The device has not been officially announced, though some rumors suggest that a Surface Book 3 will be released – likely sometime in 2020.</p>
