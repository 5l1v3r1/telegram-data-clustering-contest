      <h1>New Zealand Crusaders to keep name, change logo after Christchurch massacre</h1>

      <p>New Zealand's Canterbury Crusaders announced Friday that the team will retain its name but change its logo after a review sparked by the deadly mosque shootings in its home city of Christchurch in March.<br/><br/>Critics said the name and branding referencing medieval wars between Christians and Muslims were inappropriate after the attacks, in which 51 Muslims died in attacks allegedly carried out by a self-declared white supremacist.<br/><br/>Immediately after the killings, the Super Rugby giants stopped parading chain-mailed knights on horseback as prematch entertainment at home games, and indicated the team logo of a sword-wielding crusader would be phased out.<br/><br/>But there was resistance among fans to changing the name of arguably the world's most successful club rugby side, with a record tally of 10 Super Rugby titles, three of them won in the past three years.<br/><br/>The club said the review released Friday concluded that the name would stay, but that it would adopt the meaning of crusading for good, rather than the war-like meaning of the term.<br/><br/>The new logo is a Maori tohu, or symbol, resembling a stylized letter 'C' in the club colors of red and black.<br/><br/>"Ultimately, it was decided that no name better represented the club's commitment to living its values – crusading for social improvement and inclusiveness, and crusading with heart for our community and for each other – than Crusaders," chief executive Colin Mansbridge said.<br/><br/>The club will begin using the new logo immediately but it will not make an on-field debut until 2021, with next year's kits simply carrying the Crusaders' name.<br/><br/>Similar debates have raged in the United States over the names of sports teams with Native American associations, such as the Washington Redskins, Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians.<br/><br/>In 1997, the Washington Bullets basketball team became the Washington Wizards because then owner Abe Pollin did not want the side to have a name linked to violence.</p>
