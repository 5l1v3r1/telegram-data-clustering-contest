      <p>Gunshots have been fired on the London Bridge while London’s Metropolitan Police Service announced that officers were “in the early stages of dealing with an incident at London Bridge.”</p>
      <p>Five people were injured by a man wielding a knife who was later shot and killed by armed police officers on the bridge, which had been <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7739057/Gun-shots-heard-London-Bridge-police-confirm-incident-area.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailUK">evacuated</a>. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said, "Police were called at 1.58pm to a stabbing at premises near to London Bridge. Emergency services attended, including officers from the Met and City of London Police. A man has been detained by police. We believe a number of people have been injured. Further info to follow."</p>
      <p>Police are categorizing the attack as a terror-related incident, which left two civilians dead according to the BBC, however they are unclear about the attacker's motivation. The attacker also wore a hoax explosive vest.</p>

      <p>BBC correspondent John McManus said that he heard several shots fired on the bridge. "Just a few minutes ago I was walking across London Bridge on the south bank to the north bank of the bridge," he said. "There appeared to be a fight going on the other side of the bridge, with several men attacking one man. Police then quickly arrived, including armed police, and then a number of shots were fired at this man."</p>
      <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan released a statement saying in part, “The Metropolitan Police have confirmed that as a precaution the horrendous incident at London Bridge is being treated as though its s terrorism-related.”</p>
