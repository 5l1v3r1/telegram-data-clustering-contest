      <h3>The funniest standup I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p>The first time I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZZBidu5UU">Andrew Maxwell</a> down at the London Comedy Store. He completely destroyed.</p>
      <h3>The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3fTRk2yEgU">Tim Robinson’s “The bones are their money, so are the worms”</a> from I Think You Should Leave. It’s parodying Johnny Cash making up a song, and then the guy on bass pipes in about skeletons. It’s too hard to explain. Go watch it.</p>
      <h3>The funniest heckle I’ve ever had …</h3>
      <p>I don’t know about funniest, but getting punched in the head at the Manchester <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/comedy">Comedy</a> Store was the most memorable. He may have said something funny before he hit me, but I was too concussed to remember.</p>
      <h3>The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p>When I moved to Britain in 2000, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XRDmVSGx6o">Da Ali G Show</a>. I found it groundbreaking at the time and I still do.</p>
      <h3>The funniest film I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p>[Monty Python’s] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBbuUWw30N8">Life of Brian</a> is the funniest movie ever. I learned more about religion in Life of Brian than I did in Sunday school.</p>
      <h3>The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten …</h3>
      <p>I once had a beef wellington where they served spinach on the side. Hilarious. Who would put that together?<b> </b>It’s still a great story at parties.</p>
      <h3>The funniest joke I’ve ever heard …</h3>
      <p>“I don’t have a girlfriend, but I do know a woman who’d be mad at me for saying that” – Mitch Hedberg.</p>
