      <p>Today, for Black Friday you can get your hands on an unlocked Moto G6 for just $119. You're saving more than 50-percent on the Moto G6 today, thanks to this sale, making this a really great time to pick one up.</p>
      <p>The Moto G6 is part of Motorola's best-selling smartphone line ever. And it's also a really good device. We're looking at a 5.7-inch Full HD+ display, a Snapdragon 450 chipset, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is a micro SD card slot available for expanding storage, and it also supports Adoptable Storage. Allowing you to format that storage as internal storage for apps and games.</p>
      <p>There's a dual-camera setup around the back, with a 12-megapixel main sensor and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor. This secondary sensor is actually just a depth sensor. So don't expect to be able to switch between the two.</p>

      <p>The Moto G6 is also one of the few smartphones around now that has a capacitive fingerprint sensor, located below the screen. While most smartphones are putting them underneath the screen – and they really don't work that well – Motorola has stuck with what works. So if that is something that you need, then the Moto G6 is a good option.</p>
      <p>There is also Alexa included here. It's nothing super special. Basically you're getting the Alexa app pre-installed here. You can uninstall it if you wish, though. With Alexa on-board you'll be able to ask her questions without even opening your phone. That means that the Moto G6 has both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant included. So no matter which assistant you prefer, you'll be covered.</p>
      <p>The Moto G6 is unlocked and will work on all four US carriers. That includes AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-mobile and Verizon in the US.</p>
