      <h1>Bills Cole Beasley Takes Shot At Cowboys After Revenge Game Win (VIDEO + TWEET)</h1>

      <p>Cole Beasley spent all offseason throwing shots at his former team after they elected to let him walk in free agency after seven years.</p>
      <p>He got some much needed revenge on Thursday when the Buffalo Bills won on the road against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>The Buffalo Bills wide receiver hauled in six catches for 110 yards and a touchdown in a 26-15 statement win. After the victory, Beasley had some interesting remarks that definitely took aim at his former team.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m just glad I’m in a place where coaches believe in me, teammates believe in me, and they give me opportunities to do what I do,” said Beasley, per Bills reporter Sal Capaccio. “I was telling everybody before the game, ‘I’m glad I’m on this side while we’re here.’”</blockquote>

      <p>The 30-year-old was signed by the Cowboys in 2012 as an undrafted free agent, but left this past offseason to sign a four-year deal with the Bills.</p>
