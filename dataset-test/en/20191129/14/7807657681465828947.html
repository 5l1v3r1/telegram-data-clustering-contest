      <p>Fortnite, the worldwide battle royale sensation, doesn't take a powerhouse desktop rig to run at a high framerate, but pre-built desktop PCs usually come at a premium price due to the convenience. Thanks to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, though, this HP Pavilion gaming desktop is seriously discounted, and it has the guts to deliver a solid 1080p gaming experience. If you're looking to slay in Fortnite or other popular games, this is a great PC pick.</p>

      <p>Recommended system specs for Fortnite include a Core i5 2.8GHz CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a GPU with at least 2GB of VRAM, and anything better is going to allow you to crank up the game settings for a better experience. The Pavilion's AMD Ryzen 5 2400G CPU hits 3.60GHz and has four cores for excellent performance, it hits the 8GB of RAM recommendation (you can upgrade up to 32GB in the future), and the AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU with 4GB of VRAM is more than enough.</p>
