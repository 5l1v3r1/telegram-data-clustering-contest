      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:49:16+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coleen-rooney">Coleen Rooney</a> put her Wagatha Christie drama firmly behind her as she got all dolled up for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Wayne Rooney's wife looked gorgeous as she headed to the Julie Perry Events Christmas bash in Manchester with her mum Colette.</p>
      <p>Posing up outside Rosso Restaurant, the mum-of-four was radiant as she braved the cold by getting her legs out.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old opted for a beautiful black velvet dress with long sleeves that were embellished with tiny pearls and a matching belt with a pearl buckle.</p>
      <p>She held onto a clutch bag and finished her look off with black strappy heels, dangling earrings and flawless make up.</p>

      <p>Coleen pulled her hair back into a glam style.</p>
      <p>She also risked being seen as disloyal to Wayne's new team, Derby County, as she posed up with a Black Cat, which is seemingly the mascot for both Sunderland's football team and Julie Perry Events.</p>
      <p>Coleen happily posed up for photographers following the public spat she became embroiled in with fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy.</p>
      <p>Coleen was nicknamed Wagatha Christie in the wake of the scandal after unveiling her detective work.</p>

      <p>She said she had planted false stories on her private <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account and revealed in an epic statement that she'd blocked every account but Rebekah's from viewing her Stories to test whether or not the information would leak.</p>
      <p>And when they did, she told the world what had happened in a bombshell statement that went viral.</p>
      <p>Rebekah, who is married to footballer Jamie Vardy, has vehemently denied leaking stories about Coleen and said in her own statement that she was "disgusted" that she even had to deny it, especially when she's heavily pregnant.</p>
      <p>She was so upset that she cut her Dubai holiday short and flew back home.</p>

      <p>Becky claimed she has hired a forensic IT expert to prove her innocence and is considering legal action.</p>
      <p>But representatives for Coleen say she has irrefutable evidence that the leaks came from Rebekah's account.</p>
