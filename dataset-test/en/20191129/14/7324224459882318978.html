      <h1>Wolves Fans' Verdict v Braga: Shocking stewarding but satisfying result</h1>
      <h2>Our Wolves supporters share their thoughts on the 3-3 draw at Braga – and the problems getting into the ground.</h2>

      </p>
      <p>Off the field it was like a trip back into the 1970s with the heavy-handed security procedures and the facilities inside the ground. Fixed inflexible seats and a fine mesh netting to look through is not what we have come to expect from our matchday experience. On the field however our play belongs firmly in this era, with football at times like nothing we have witnessed before. Circumstances and the result could have been better, but the blistering thirty minute spell of play, and the atmosphere in that period, is something that feels quite emotional thinking back, and that memory will stay with me till I die. Hopefully, many of you who were fortunate enough to be there, will feel the same way.</p>

        <b>Man of the Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>Coady and Dendoncker were solid at the back, Neves and Moutinho did well while Jimenez had a good game too. MOTM goes to Traore however.</p>
      <p>

      <p>We had some weary legs during the second half. December is a busy month, we need to stay fresh and full of energy.</p>

      <p>Tale of two halves in the end. First half was absolutely brilliant, we were such good value for our lead and we had complete control of the game, however we got complacent and conceded two sloppy goals which is frustrating in itself because we should have won and it was a great chance to go top of the group. We have qualified for the knockout stages though which is amazing and we can afford to rest some key players in the Besiktas game. I know we can still win the group but we have to win and then rely on Bratislava at least getting a point against Braga.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Man of the Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>Traore, Jonny and Jimenez were our three standout players by far I thought. Traore was unplayable at times, the way he was beating players with his speed and close control dribbling was insane, took his goal really well too. Jonny offered a real threat down the left in the first half and his cross for Jimenez’s goal was on point. Raul with another goal to his tally and two assists also, the pick of them being the pass for Doherty’s goal which Messi or De Bruyne would have been very proud of.</p>

      <p>Just like the Bournemouth game we had a brilliant first half and then just played completely different in the second. We seem to play really well in one of the halves and then play absolutely terrible in the other. There were some issues defensively and we’ll definitely have to iron out those for Sheffield United who will be a tough test for us on Sunday.</p>

        <b>Reaction to the Result</b>
      </p>
      <p>With over 6,000 fans here to witness Wolves qualify for the knockout stages of a European competition, for first time in 47 years, of course, we are delighted to have got the draw that was required. It seemed as though everything was against us getting to the game. In scenes reminiscent of the classic film Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles we had to try every which way to get to the game, with the now torrential rain merely adding to the occasion. Surprised but pleased we made it to the stadium in time for kick off, we were then kept outside for over 90 minutes while over jealous police and stewards stripped us of our belongings. We could “hear” the goals go in and celebrated just the same. It will be good to think “we were there” in years to come!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Man of the Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t feel able to give a Man of the Match. Wolves were 3-1 up when we made it into the stadium, so all we got to see was a 2-0 defeat! The first half must have been awesome; as the second half was poor. Three players made a good impression – Neves, Saiss and Jonny – but we defended badly to let Braga get back into the game. The first half did look fabulous after a “catch up” at the hotel.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Something to Improve</b>
      </p>
      <p>The team deserve all the plaudits for qualifying with a game to spare. Fingers can be pointed to our club for the lack of due diligence before fans travelled. There was inadequate travel set up from the Braga square to the stadium (unlike Turin). The welcome we received at the stadium was barbaric and disorganised. It was complete and utter chaos out there. There is no excuse. Braga were happy to sell tickets direct to UK citizens, at double the price of those sold by Wolves. They knew how many fans were travelling, but appeared to be completely overwhelmed. It was a shambles. Braga, you have a beautiful picturesque stadium, spoiled somewhat by having to watch through netting. Your officials, stewards and local police are an utter disgrace.</p>
