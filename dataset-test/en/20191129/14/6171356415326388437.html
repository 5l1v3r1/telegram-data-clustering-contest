      <h1>Grab a Nokia 4.2 for $159 from Amazon and B&amp;H ($30 off)</h1>

      <p>Deals abound this holiday season, so here's another one for the pile. Nokia's budget 4.2 smartphone has dropped to $159 on both Amazon and B&amp;H, a nice savings of $30 off the MSRP.</p>
      <p>For starters, if you're looking for more info on the 4.2, then be sure to check out Scott's review <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/25/nokia-4-2-review-performance-issues-spoil-another-budget-nokia-phone/">right here</a>. Unfortunately for this little phone, it suffers from performance problems, a poor-quality display, a laggy camera, and sub-par battery life.</p>

      <p>For perspective, however, it packs a 5.71" 720x1520 TFT LCD display, a Snapdragon 439 SoC, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a 13MP+2MP rear camera setup, and a 3,000mAh battery. As you can see from the screenshot above, it only works on the GSM carriers like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p>
      <p>While it may not be the best phone around, for $159, it'd make for a decent backup device or a starter smartphone. If you're interested, then choose from the buy links below.</p>
