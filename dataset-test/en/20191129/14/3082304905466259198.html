        <b>There appears little chance of Mikel Arteta moving to Arsenal imminently as the oft-linked coach continues Manchester City preparations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola confirmed Mikel Arteta will travel with Manchester City to Newcastle United but would not discuss whether his assistant might be a target for Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Arteta was linked with former club Arsenal when Arsene Wenger departed in 2018, before Unai Emery was appointed head coach.</p>
      <p>But Emery was sacked on Friday following a run of seven matches without a win in all competitions, again prompting talk of Arteta returning to London.</p>
      <p>Guardiola would only affirm the Spaniard remains a member of his staff for the trip to Tyneside when he faced the media on Friday.</p>
      <p>“He is in the squad, he travels to Newcastle.” Guardiola said of his fellow Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Asked about the possibility of Arsenal making an approach for the 37-year-old, the City boss said: “It’s not a question for me.”</p>

      <p>Guardiola expressed sympathy for Emery and said his opinion of the former Sevilla and Paris Saint-Germain coach had not been altered by a poor run.</p>
      <p>“I’m so sorry for him,” the City boss said. “Every time a manager is sacked, it’s not good news.</p>
      <p>“It changes nothing about my opinion on his capacity. He is an incredible professional, who did incredibly well in Spain and in France.</p>
      <p>“He made an incredible achievement. I don’t think anybody – okay, Zinedine Zidane with Real Madrid [in the Champions League] – could win three Europa Leagues in a row with Sevilla.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the most incredible achievements. But that’s football. He knows, I know it depends on the results. It’s simple. But I’m sure he will find a new job soon.”</p>
