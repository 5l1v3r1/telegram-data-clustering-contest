        <b>Liverpool have announced proposals for extending the capacity of Anfield to over 61,000, while the club is also aiming to host GAA and NFL matches at the stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool want to add around 7,000 sears to the Anfield Road Stand, the majority of which will be general admission tickets.</p>
      <p>The proposal is still in the draft stage and does not include any fixed dates for construction or completion.</p>
      <p>Liverpool will hold a public consultation first with a number of drop-in events to take place over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Liverpool's chief operating officers, Andy Hughes, told the club website: "For any expansion to the Anfield Road Stand to go ahead we need certainty on three key areas.</p>
      <p>“Firstly, that we are able to reach agreement with local residents, businesses and community groups that they will allow the expansion plan to take place, which will mean closing a short section of Anfield Road between 96 Avenue and Skerries Road.</p>
      <p>“Secondly, that we have the right sustainable financial and economic model in place to deliver a long-term sustainable Anfield. And lastly, that we are able to successfully navigate the complex planning landscape. We need to be satisfied on all three points for work to proceed.</p>
      <p>“We are working towards creating an expanded Anfield Road Stand which will see around 7,000 additional seats. The majority of these seats will be for general admission use and we expect some seats will be allocated for a sports bar/lounge-type hospitality in order to ensure the economic viability of the expansion.</p>
      <p>“Further profiling is needed and we expect to provide more detail at the second-stage consultation early next year. These first-stage consultation sessions we are holding are crucial as they will be used to inform the design proposals we are developing, which in turn will help us to make a decision on whether to proceed with the expansion as a whole.”</p>

      <p>The statement adds: "The plans for the proposed Anfield Road Stand expansion include exploring the opportunity for permanent permission to hold concerts and other major events at Anfield, including other sporting events such as Gaelic games and American football outside of the matchday calendar."</p>
      <p>The proposed redevelopment would cost somewhere in the region of £60 million and it would make the fabled Kop stand the smallest in Anfield.</p>
