        <b>For John Wilson and Sue Lloyd, it was a mutual love of dancing that brought them together.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The couple, of Lostock Hall, had both lost their spouses six years ago and, individually, decided to take dance lessons at Greens Dance Centre in Lostock Hall.<br/>They met and became good friends, sharing evenings and holidays, and over the years their relationship blossomed until one New Year’s Eve, John, who is originally from Arnside, proposed.<br/>Their love of dancing has continued and have spent many happy hours dancing both at Greens and at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool.<br/>They tied the knot at St James Church before heading off to Farington Lodge for afternoon tea and an evening buffet.<br/>Sue, who is a commissioning support officer for the NHS and hails from the Wirral, said: “Fortunately we had one of the driest, sunniest days in October. <br/>“The day itself was magical! Especially as so many of our family and good friends could share it with us. I was led down the aisle by my brother, Ronnie Lloyd and the service in church was wonderful, conducted by Father Matthew McMurray.<br/>“The reception and evening buffet at Farington Lodge was above expectations and they couldn’t do enough for us.”<br/>And of course their first dance had to be special. It was choreographed by Denise Green and based on a waltz, a special moment as it was the first dance they had learned together.<br/>John, 73, a retired building surveyor, said: “It was a truly special day, the memory of which will last forever.<br/>Ann, who is 62, added: “It was a truly special day and if I could I would wind it back and replay it I would.”<br/>They enjoyed a small honeymoon in Cornwall and plan a cruise next year.
