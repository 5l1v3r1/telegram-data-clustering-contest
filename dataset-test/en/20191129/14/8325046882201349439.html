      <p>Conception doesn’t always lead to a baby. Sometimes pregnancy ends quickly on its own.</p>
      <p>A very early type of <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/miscarriage">miscarriage</a> known as a chemical pregnancy takes place shortly after conception, and you may not even notice it unless you take a <a href="https://www.insider.com/when-to-take-a-pregnancy-test">sensitive pregnancy test</a>.</p>
      <h4>A chemical pregnancy does not produce an embryo</h4>
      <p>“What happens is a woman comes in and she has a positive pregnancy test, and you look on an ultrasound and you don’t see an embryo,” says <a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/michael-cackovic">Michael Cackovic</a>, MD, who practices maternal-fetal medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.</p>
      <p>A chemical pregnancy happens when one of your eggs and a sperm combine, but the combination doesn’t develop into an embryo. Technically, you’ve conceived, which is why a <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-accurate-are-home-pregnancy-tests">pregnancy test</a> might give you a positive result.</p>
      <p>But if no sign of an embryo appears on a second ultrasound at a later date, then you probably experienced a chemical pregnancy, Cackovic tells Insider.</p>
      <h4>Symptoms of a chemical pregnancy</h4>
      <p>It’s a condition that can easily go unnoticed.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes women don’t even know they are pregnant,” Cackovic says, and their period is “just late.”</p>
      <p>Since a chemical pregnancy happens early on, chances are you may have experienced some of the <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-are-the-symptoms-of-pregnancy">typical symptoms</a> of early pregnancy, including morning sickness, breast tenderness, and fatigue.</p>
      <p>Yet if you’ve had a chemical pregnancy you’ll probably see those symptoms disappear and you might experience bleeding as well, says <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid%253D33838%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1574909902168000&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1574909902179000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHJtYqdxD0zbabELXSRdv2DZdO2BA">Maura Quinlan</a>, MD, an associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.</p>
      <h4>Chemical pregnancies are probably common</h4>
      <p>It’s unclear how frequently chemical pregnancies occur, but doctors say they’re common.</p>
      <p>“Back in the day, pregnancy tests were only done when someone missed two periods,” Quinlan says. “No one knew they were having miscarriages.”</p>
      <p>But because of the highly sensitive tests in use today, people are now more aware of early miscarriages, she adds.</p>
      <h4>Causes of a chemical pregnancy</h4>
      <p>Chemical pregnancies can occur for a number of reasons. The most common has to do with problems with the chromosomes in your egg or your partner’s sperm.</p>
      <p>Normally during conception, you pass on 23 chromosomes and your partner contributes 23 for a total of 46 chromosomes. But sometimes that number is too high or too low, which can lead to a chemical pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Half of all miscarriages that occur within the first trimester – or 13 weeks of pregnancy – happen because an egg or sperm carries an <a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/For-Patients/faq090.pdf">abnormal number</a> of chromosomes, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>
      <p>Yet you have no control over this abnormality. There’s no activity – exercise, sex, fasting – that can cause a chemical pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Cackovic says that he tells his patients, “That glass of wine you had before you knew you were pregnant did not do this. It was a predetermined situation.”</p>
      <p>And you shouldn’t get too discouraged because “it is a good sign that a pregnancy started,” Quinlan says. If you’re having trouble getting pregnant in the first place – say, if the man has a low sperm count – then you’re unlikely to have a chemical pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a chemical pregnancy is a sign that you can get pregnant and should <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-soon-after-a-miscarriage-can-you-get-pregnant">try again</a> if you so choose.</p>
