      <p>Amazon is shaving $50 off of the regular price of the Oculus Rift S, allowing you to pick it up fro just $349 this Black Friday. That's a pretty good price for the Oculus Rift S, which is still a really good virtual reality headset.</p>
      <p>The Oculus Rift S is one of those cheap but very well built products. So even at under $400, this is the virtual reality headset to get. You'll be able to play hundreds of games on the Rift S.</p>
      <p>Amazon is including the controllers with the Rift S as well, which makes the experience of playing a game in VR all that much better.</p>

      <p>Oculus improved the optics on the Rift S, so you are able to stare down the competition with new lenses and a sharper display. This is important when talking about VR, since that display is much closer to your eyes. So a full HD display won't look great, and even a 4K display may not look super good either.</p>
      <p>It now has an ergonomic design, so you can keep your head in the game. This is thanks to the halo headband that was redesigned with speed in mind. The Rift S is going to stay securely on your head, so you won't need to worry about it flying off of your head when you're playing different games.</p>
      <p>For any gamer that's on your shopping list this year, the Oculus Rift S is going to be a really great gift to pick up. And now that it is just $349, it's even more affordable than ever. Of course, cheaper VR headsets are out there, but they don't offer the same experience as the Rift S.</p>
