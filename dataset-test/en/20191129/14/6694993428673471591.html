      <h1>What TV channel is Manchester United vs Aston Villa on? Kick-off time and early team news</h1>
      <h2>Man United are hoping to return to winning ways in the Premier League against Aston Villa on Sunday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Bray, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/joe-bray/</a></address>
      <p>After a promising run of one defeat in eight games, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are now winless in their last two outings.</p>
      <p>A 3-3 draw at Sheffield United last weekend was a set-back in the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League,</a> before a young side were beaten 2-1 in Astana on Thursday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> used almost completely different squads for both those games, allowing the more senior players who fought back from 2-0 down at Sheffield United to have a week's worth of rest.</p>
      <p>Attention now turns to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa,</a> who are improving as the season progresses following promotion last term. United should have no issues of match fitness having left plenty of first teamers at home this week, and will be looking to build some momentum ahead of tricky fixtures against Tottenham and Manchester City in the coming week.</p>
      <h3>What channel is Manchester United vs Aston Villa on?</h3>
      <p>Manchester United vs Aston Villa will not be broadcast live on UK television.</p>
      <p>The match, which kicks off at 4.30pm at Old Trafford, is being played on Sunday due to United's Europa League commitments this week.</p>
      <p>There will be highlights of the game on Match of the Day 2 (BBC 1, 10.30pm) and we will bring you live match updates as always on our match blog here on <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">MEN Sport.</a></p>
      <h3>Team news for Manchester United vs Aston Villa</h3>
      <p>United could welcome back Scott McTominay from injury, but Paul Pogba will once again miss out as he continues to recover from injury.</p>
      <p>None of the starting XI that faced Sheffield United travelled to Kazakhstan this week, although Jesse Lingard, Mason Greenwood, Axel Tuanzebe and James Garner all played among the players on the bench at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>Luke Shaw returned from injury in Astana, but he is unlikely to be risked with Brandon Williams and Ashley Young both rested this week.</p>
