      <p>Recently, she took to Twitter and criticised a man for making fun of a woman who was accused of indecency and asked to wear a shawl by a Swiggy delivery boy.</p>
      <p>The woman from Tamil Nadu experienced a social backlash on social media after delivery boy tweeted about her appearing before him in an unpresentable manner.</p>
      <p>Narrating the incident on social media, the woman said the delivery boy turned up at the door with food and told her to wear a shawl in her own house.</p>
      <p>The woman tagged Swiggy and wrote: “@swiggy_in can your employees mind their own business? One of your delivery persons asked me to put on a shawl coming to my own house. Why does it matter? Do we have to teach manners to them?”</p>
      <p>Sripaada came out in support and wrote from her Instagram handle: “Men who need to stare at women’s breasts…Doesn’t look like they got weaned from breastfeeding properly.”</p>
