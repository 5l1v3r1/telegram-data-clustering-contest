      <h1>Of course the Cybertruck's been modded into GTA 5</h1>
      <h2>And Minecraft. And Rocket League. And GoldenEye 007.</h2>

      <p>I suppose it's only a few polygons, but still, modders have acted with remarkable speed to put Elon Musk's latest <s>meme</s> vehicle in almost every conceivable game. While many of these Cybertruck mods are not yet publicly downloadable, several YouTube videos have appeared displaying demo models and early attempts - some of which, er, look better than others.</p>
      <p>One of the more basic models for GTA 5 has been demoed by YouTube channel Elite Rejects, with neither of the video's hosts feeling particularly impressed by the truck. It really does look like a texture pop-in problem - but then, so does the real life Cybertruck.</p>

      <p>The best one I've seen for GTA so far is by YouTube channel Fred Walkthrough, which already has working lights and genuinely looks like something straight out of Cyberpunk 2077. It's still a work in progress, and the creator says they're not yet ready to publicly release the build, but it's already looking nearly complete - it even has a cupholder with coffee.</p>

      <p>I think you could take a fair chunk out of any unfortunate pedestrians by using the Cybertruck in GTA, but it could probably also wreck rival players if used in Rocket League - which is something modder Platypun has managed to achieve in this ridiculous Rocket League mod. I wonder if the windows smash when the ball hits them.</p>
      <p>Some Rocket League fans are so eager for the truck to be added, in fact, they've <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tesla-put-the-tesla-cybertruck-in-rocket-league">started a petition to get it officially added to the game</a> - although it's not just the devs they're petitioning. "Please sign this petition and fight to put it in the hands of the man with the plan himself. He will do it for us. He will do it for the memes. He will do it because he is the one and only: Elon Musk."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, in the world of Minecraft, the game famous for its cubes has been given something rather more angular this week. Created by VelVoxel Raptor, once you've downloaded the Cybertruck datapack and correctly installed the model, you can summon it with a block of iron and a lever, like some arcane ritual to Elon Musk. Once it's there, it's both drivable and indestructible. Not very realistic, then.</p>
      <p>The demo video contains dangerous levels of dubstep - you have been warned.</p>

      <p>And, finally, the Cybertruck has found its low-poly home: a little 90s game called GoldenEye 007. It's certainly a step up from the photoshopped images doing the rounds a few days ago, and you really have to credit YouTuber Graslu00 for their dedication to the memes.</p>
      <p>There's also a model of Elon Musk, complete with custom dialogue, that will forever haunt my dreams.</p>

      <p>It's early days, but I'm sure it won't b'elon before the GTA mods are made available for public use - and you can always get started on Minecraft.</p>
