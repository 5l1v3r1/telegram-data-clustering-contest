      <p>Internal storage in a personal computer is critical for storing your work onboard the machine, though you have the option to store in external storage disks as well. If your computer came with limited internal storage, you can enhance the storage by adding the SSD cards of 500 GB, 1 TB or 2 TB depending on how much storage you need and how much your PC can accommodate.</p>
