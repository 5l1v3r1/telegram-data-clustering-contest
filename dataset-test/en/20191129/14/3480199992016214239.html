      <p>Police have declared a knife rampage in central London as a terror incident and confirmed that the suspect was shot dead by armed officers on London Bridge.</p>
      <p>Several people were stabbed by the knifeman before he was grappled to the ground and disarmed by members of the public.</p>
      <p>Footage on social media appeared to show one man being pulled away by armed officers before the suspect is shot at point-blank range.</p>
      <p>Another bystander could be seen carrying a large knife from the scene.</p>
      <p>Eye-witnesses said the suspect appeared to be wearing a suicide vest but Neil Basu, the head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said the vest was a fake.</p>
      <p>He said police were called at around 2pm on Friday to a stabbing “at a premises near London Bridge”.</p>
      <p>Borough Market, at the opposite end of the bridge to where the suspect was shot, was cordoned off in the wake of the incident.</p>
      <p>The bridge and the market were the scene of a terror attack  in 2017 in which eight victims were killed along with the three terrorists.</p>
      <p>After being shot, the suspect in Friday’s attack raised his arms towards his head before lying still.</p>
      <p>Mr Basu told reporters:  “A male suspect was shot by specialist armed officers from City of London police and I can confirm that this suspect died at the scene.”</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard said a number of people were stabbed but did not give any details.</p>
      <p>The London Ambulance Service declared it a major incident and one picture  on social media appeared to show a body covered with a blanket.</p>

      <p>After speaking to reporters, Mr Basu said he was going to Downing St to brief the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Witnesses described a scene of panic around London Bridge, moments after the incident.</p>
      <p>Witness Kelby McNally, OK! Online’s editor, works in the Northern and Shell Building on Lower Thames Street near to London Bridge, said she initially thought a fire alarm had gone when she saw “loads of people just running”.</p>
      <p>She told the PA news agency. “There were loads of people just running, I thought it was a fire alarm or something, and then I saw two girls from my office who told me not to go back there.</p>
      <p>“I asked what had happened, and they said they had heard gunshots and now everyone is running.”</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “I’m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response.”</p>
      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel wrote on Twitter: “Very concerned by ongoing incident at London Bridge. My thoughts are with all affected. I am grateful for the rapid response of our police and I urge everyone to follow their advice.”</p>
      <p>Footage from the scene appeared to show a white lorry straddling the northbound and southbound carriageways.</p>

      <p>London buses can be seen either side of the lorry while three police cars are parked next to it on the bridge.</p>
      <p>Nurse Jackie Bensfield, 32, described how she asked to be let off a bus on London Bridge after she heard “five or six” gunshots.</p>

      <p>Ms Bensfield, who was on her way home from work, said she exited the bus and “ran like hell” to escape the shots.</p>
      <p>Connor Allen, who was in his van on the bridge when it was evacuated said: “Everyone just started running, you heard these pops and that was it. We just got out the van and started running.”</p>
      <p>One business owner told the PA news agency she had been crossing London Bridge to get to her shop on the north side when police officers stopped her.</p>

      <p>She said that was when she heard at least five or six gunshots and said that her store has been evacuated.</p>
      <p>The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “We heard shooting, it was about five or six shots, I heard five or six quite clearly.</p>
      <p>“All my staff have been evacuated.”</p>
