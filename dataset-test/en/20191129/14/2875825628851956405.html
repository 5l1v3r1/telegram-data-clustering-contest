      <h1>Tammy Abraham injury update provided by Chelsea boss Frank Lampard</h1>
      <h2>Striker Abraham suffered a hip injury during the Chelsea's Champions League draw with Valencia - and is now set to miss out vs West Ham on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:58:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Tammy Abraham will miss Chelsea's Premier League clash with West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Striker Abraham suffered a hip injury during the Blues' Champions League draw with Valencia - and was forced off at half time as he struggled in pain.</p>
      <p>But the Blues are still unsure how long the England front man will be sidelined for with hip trouble.</p>
      <p>Abraham sat out training at Cobham on Friday and will definitely sit out the meeting with the Hammers at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Manager Frank Lampard expects <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> to know by Monday the extent of Abraham's hip issue, a problem he suffered in the Blues' 2-2 Champions League draw at Valencia on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>"We'll know by the end of the weekend, he's got some pain and won't be involved tomorrow," said Lampard. "But then we'll know by Monday."</p>
      <p>Abraham landed awkwardly on his hip in Chelsea's Champions League clash at the Mestalla and was carried off on a stretcher at half-time.</p>

      <p>The 22-year-old insisted straight after the match that his injury was not as bad as he had first feared, but the Blues are still assessing their star striker.</p>
      <p>Michy Batshuayi replaced Abraham off the bench in Valencia and will battle it out with Olivier Giroud to lead Chelsea's line against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>Abraham has fired 10 goals and laid on two assists in a blistering Premier League start this term, but Lampard insisted he is confident the Blues boast the firepower to cope in his absence.</p>
      <p>"The other lads have been training well, every day is a work day so whenever chances come they are ready and I have every confidence in them," said Lampard.</p>
      <p>"Michy has shown work ethic and quality, which I knew anyway. It's not easy when you're not playing as many minutes as you'd want."</p>
