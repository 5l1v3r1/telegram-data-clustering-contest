      <h1>Pamela Anderson linked with late appearance on I'm A Celebrity after being seen in Australia</h1>
      <h2>She arrived on the Gold Coast in Oz this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:26:48+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Ex Baywatch star Pamela Anderson has been tipped to join <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> as a late entrant.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old actress is said to have been spotted at the Palazzo Versace Hotel - where campmates stay before and after their time in the jungle - by Adele Roberts’ partner Kate Holderness.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pamela-anderson-swimsuit-low-cut">US media reports</a> reckon animal rights activist Pam is down under to film a commercial, rather than chew on a vegan substitute for kangaroo anus - but did not specify for what brand or product the ad might be for.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1">BBC Radio 1</a>, Kate told presenter Greg James: "Pamela Anderson has been randomly spotted. She's staying at the hotel."</p>

      <p>An excited Greg replied: "That might be related, that they might be putting Pamela Anderson into the jungle."</p>
      <p>But Kate was not so convinced - although she didn’t dismiss the possibility Pamela could be joining the likes of Ian Wright, Caitlyn Jenner, Jacqueline Jossa and Kate Garraway in the Aussie rainforest camp.</p>

      <p>"I don't think they are," Kate responded.</p>
      <p>"I think she's just chilling. But you never know, you never know."</p>

      <p>Pamela - whose reality TV experience includes a brief, flop run on Dancing On Ice - reportedly spent yesterday on a yacht, thought to be the location for the possible commercial and photoshoot.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the environmental issues close to her heart, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pamela-anderson-swimsuit-low-cut">she recently wrote in an open letter to PETA</a>: "I arrived on the Gold Coast this week after spending almost a month following news about the devastating fires in Australia.</p>
      <p>"I realise that, for some, now is a sensitive time to broach the subject of climate change, but I trust you will agree that having these difficult yet important conversations now might save lives in the future.</p>
      <p>"As you've already noted, the science is clear: climate change has played a key role in the severity of this year's bushfires. But acknowledging this is only half the battle. Australia has one of the highest greenhouse-gas emissions per capita of any nation, largely driven by one sector: animal agriculture."</p>
      <p>A representative for I'm A Celebrity told ED: "If you google Pamela Anderson and Gold Coast it'll tell you why she's here in Australia."</p>
