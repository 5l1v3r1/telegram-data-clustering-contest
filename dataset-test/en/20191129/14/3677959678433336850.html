      <p>When it first came out, Google’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/pixel-4-xl-announces-specs-features-pricing-availability-details/">Pixel 4 lineup</a> had a base price of $799 and for a lot of customers, that’s a lot of money to be shelling on a flagship device. Thankfully, for the latest Black Friday 2019 deal, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL feature a starting price of $599. If you’re dead set on an Android flagship that offers the cleanest user interface coupled with one of the best cameras on the market, you’ll absolutely love this deal.</p>
      <p>Just to remind you, the Pixel 4 64GB starts from $599, while the Pixel 4 XL 64GB is being offered at $699 on Amazon. Both are unlocked versions and in case you wanted higher storage variants, even the 128GB versions are being sold at discounted prices. While a lot of customers may be able to make use of 64GB of the base internal memory, some may not, and because the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL don’t ship with a microSD card slot, it would be wise to pick up the higher capacity variant if you’re a user that likes to carry around a variety of media in their mobile phones.</p>
      <p>As for why you should purchase the Pixel 4 or the Pixel 4 XL, one of them is obviously, the camera. For this year, Google has introduced a dual-rear-camera for both the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. One is a primary 12MP sensor, while the second one is a 12MP telephoto unit that takes advantage of Google’s Super Res Zoom, and gives you features like Portrait imaging through a dedicated secondary lens as well as Night Sight. Both Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL also come running the latest version of Google Assistant, which only means that the newest updates will be rolled out for these models too.</p>
      <p>Coming to the hardware specifications, both smartphones feature OLED screens with a fluid 90Hz refresh rate, underpinned by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-855-vs-snapdragon-855-plus-specifications-comparison/">Snapdragon 855</a>, along with 6GB of RAM. If you were complaining before as to why Google stamped a $799 starting price on Pixel 4, this discount may make you change your purchasing decision almost immediately.</p>
