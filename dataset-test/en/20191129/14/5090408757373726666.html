      <h3>The springs’ crystal clear water makes for ideal diving, kayaking, paddleboarding, and tubing — but it’s also becoming a big destination for RV tourists, according to Jon Gray, CEO of RVshare.</h3>

      <h3>Gray told Business Insider that today’s travelers “want something that’s off the beaten track.” He attributes that to the desire to stand out on social media.</h3>

      <p>Gray thinks people are specifically picking travel destinations based on photo opportunities but doesn’t see that as a negative: “One of the upsides of the Instagramming of travel is that people try new things – they don’t want to do things that are seen as touristy.”</p>

      <h3>Ginnie Springs does seem to be attracting quite a bit of attention on social media; unsurprisingly, most of the most-liked shots with the #ginniesprings hashtag capitalize on the area’s gorgeous colors.</h3>

      <h3>Gray said Ginnie Springs is such a popular destination for his clients because, beyond its Instagrammable blues, it taps into a desire to reconnect with nature.</h3>

      <p>“The US has become more urban,” Gray told Business Insider. “People are working in an office all day long and wanting to do something different. The desire to get into nature is there – this idea of disconnecting to reconnect.”</p>
      <p>As an added plus, it’s also an accessible destination regardless of the <a href="https://ginniespringsoutdoors.com/">season</a>: the springs stay at 72 degrees year-round.</p>
