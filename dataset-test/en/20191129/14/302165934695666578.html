      <p>LONDON, Nov 29 — British police shot a man today after a stabbing in the London Bridge area in the centre of the city.</p>
      <p>A 14-second video clip on Twitter filmed from a high vantage point showed what appeared to be three police officers backing away from a man lying on the pavement.</p>
      <p>Two officers are pointing rifles at the man, who can be seen moving slightly. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.</p>
      <p>“One man has been shot by police,” police said. “As a precaution, we are currently responding to this incident as though it is terror-related,” they added.</p>
      <p>Police were called at 1.58pm to a stabbing at a premises near London Bridge. Reuters earlier quoted a security source saying that a man had been shot after a stabbing.</p>
      <p>A number of people have been injured.</p>
      <p>Sky News said there was at least one fatality and that the person killed was not a suspect. Reuters was unable to confirm that report.</p>
      <p>Reuters pictures showed several police cars and buses on the bridge. Armed police, some with dogs, patrolled the surrounding streets.</p>
      <p>The ambulance service declared what it called a “major incident” in the area and London Bridge, a major commuter hub, station was closed.</p>
      <p>People in buildings around the scene were evacuated to the north side of the River Thames by security services.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on his way back to Downing Street to receive updates.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement: “I’m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response.”</p>
      <p>London Bridge was the scene of an attack in June 2017 when three militants drove a van into pedestrians and then attacked people in the surrounding area, killing eight people.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Britain lowered its national terrorism threat level to “substantial” from “severe”, its lowest level since 2014. — Reuters</p>
