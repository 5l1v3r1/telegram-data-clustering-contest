      <p>If you're a dog owner, you're going to love this product. As you can keep an eye on your dog, and make sure they aren't getting into trouble when you're not home, but you can also give them treats when you're not home. And what dog doesn't love getting treats?</p>
      <p>The camera records in 1080p, so you're going to get a pretty good picture out of this one, though it would be nicer if it was in 4K.</p>

      <p>It can also alert you when your dog starts barking. There's two-way audio and it can sense when your dog is barking. This is definitely a good thing if you live in an apartment, as you won't want your dog to be annoying your neighbors when you aren't home.</p>
      <p>Using the Furbo app – available on iOS and Android – you can toss a treat to your dog when you're not there. You can fill it with your dogs favorite treats and also play catch with the dog when you're not home. Which is really cool, and should help with their anxiety when you've left.</p>
      <p>Furbo is also compatible with Amazon Alexa, so you can ask Alexa to check in on your dog, or to throw a treat to them.</p>
