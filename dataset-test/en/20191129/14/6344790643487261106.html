      <h1>Luke Skywalker Returns to Cloud City to Look for His Lost Lightsaber in New STAR WARS Comic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:00:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joey Paur</a></address>
      <p>There’s a new <i>Star Wars </i>comic coming out that’s set shortly after the events of<b><i> The Empire Strikes Back</i></b> that will explore what happened to Luke Skywalker’s Lightsaber after Darth Vader cut off his right hand that was holding it.</p>
      <p>The hand and the Lightsaber fell into Cloud City. The next time we see Anakin Skywalker’s Lightsaber that was handed down to Luke by Obi-Wan Kenobi is in<i> The Force Awakens</i> in the basement of Maz Kanata’s castle. Han Solo asks where she got the Lightsaber, and she said that it’s a good question “for another time.” I guess the time has come.</p>
      <p>The new story sees Luke Skywalker returning to Cloud City with Princess Leia and Lando Calrissian in order to find the Lightsaber. Here’s the official synopsis and cover art for<i> Star Wars #3</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>The end of the war and the final defeat of the Rebel Alliance are inevitable as the cunning Imperial Commander Zahra unleashes her fury against the splintered and scattered survivors. But where have the Rebellion’s greatest heroes gone when their cause needs them the most? Luke Skywalker’s only hope at becoming a Jedi Knight was lost during his battle with Darth Vader …and so he, Princess Leia and Lando Calrissian must return to Cloud City to find it! But Leia has her own covert mission to accomplish there…and Lando’s mysterious reason for returning could very well ruin their only chance at success!</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I’m curious to see how this story plays out and learn what happened to Luke’s Lightsaber after he lost it. Hopefully, it provides some real insight.</p>
      <p>Star Wars #3 arrives on shelves in February 2020.</p>
