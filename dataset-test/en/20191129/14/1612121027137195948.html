      <p>We <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/phone/oppo-reno-10x-review/">reviewed</a> the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/339052-oppos-reno-10x-zoom-edition-ditches-the-notch-in-favor-of-a-wedge/">Reno 10x Zoom Edition</a> from OPPO earlier this which impressed us in almost every aspect apart from the ColorOS software experience that felt a little clunky at times with missing features such as dark mode and full icon customization. OPPO would appear to have taken the complaints on board because it recently announced ColorOS 7 that is based on <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343746-android-10-official/">Android 10</a> with the promise of a lightweight visual approach as well as the inclusion of the all-important dark mode. If you have a Reno or <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/reno-10x-zoom-edition/">Reno 10x Zoom</a> you can get in on the ColorOS 7 action because OPPO has announced that beta programs for the two phones have gone live. Join us after the break for more details.</p>

      <p>The ColorOS 7 beta trials for the Reno and Reno 10x Zoom will each accept a first batch of 5,000 participants. Both trials are already underway, so there is no time to lose if you want to experience Android 10 on your eligible handset sooner than everyone else.</p>
      <p>To get the ColorOS 7 beta OTA, you’ll need to ensure that your handset is updated to the latest official software builds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reno:</b> CPH1917EX_11.A.12_0121_201909252249 or CPH1917EX_11.A.13_0130_201910282307</li>
        <li><b>Reno 10x Zoom:</b> CPH1919EX_11.A.14_0140_201910221746 or CPH1919EX_11.A.13_0130_201909211214</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next, go to “Settings” and then “Software Updates” before tapping the settings icon in the upper right corner. Select “Trial Version” and fill in the required information, read and then click the “Must-know” checkbox, and select “Apply Now”. Now go back to “Settings – Software Update” and check to see if the beta firmware is available to download.</p>
