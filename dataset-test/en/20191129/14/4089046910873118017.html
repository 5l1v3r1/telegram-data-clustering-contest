      <p>GLENPOOL, Okla. (AP) -- An Oklahoma police chief says an officer bought Starbucks for 911 dispatchers working on Thanksgiving only to find that the word "PIG" was printed on the cups' labels.</p>
      <p>The officer notified Kiefer Police Chief Johnny O'Mara, who called the store and spoke to a manager. O'Mara says they offered to reprint the computer-generated labels, but he took to social media and posted the photo. It has since gone viral.</p>
      <p>The officer told KTUL-TV that the employee reached out to him personally and apologized, saying it was a joke.</p>
      <p>Starbucks spokesperson Jory Mendes says the company is deeply sorry and has apologized to the officer who received the five cups.</p>
      <p>Mory says the barista has been suspended pending the outcome of the internal investigation.</p>
      <p>Last year, Starbucks closed stores and had employees undergo a anti-bias training after the arrest of two black men in a Philadelphia location. The coffee chain's executives met with Arizona officers earlier this year after six officers were asked to leave a store because a customer felt unsafe.</p>
