      <p>They say behind every successful man is a strong woman and behind every skilful midfielder is an even stronger one. Nobody embodies this more than Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka and his wife Larelle.</p>
      <p>Check out their glamorous life.</p>
      <p>Maluleka recently gave fans an idea of how the lovely couple met when they were just 13 years old.</p>
      <p>“At age 13 I saw her, approached her, said hello and she said hi back. The rest is history as you can see. The Malulekas,” the midfielder wrote on Instagram, along with an image of his wife.</p>
