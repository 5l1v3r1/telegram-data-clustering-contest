      <p>We're positively swimming in new Nintendo Switch releases every week at this point - our constantly overflowing inbox serves as a regular, major indicator of this (send help) - but we don't expect to see new games arrive for the nearly-30-years-old SNES.</p>
      <p>That's exactly what we've been treated to today, however, with the launch of <b>Yo-Yo Shuriken</b>. The game comes from the same developer who recently brought us a new Game Boy title, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/dmg_deals_damage_is_a_game_boy_game_where_you_smash_up_old_tech_as_a_game_boy">DMG Deals Damage</a></b>, and is an action game designed for one to two players. An action game with ninjas and robots, no less.</p>

      <p>Its core gameplay revolves around shooting a single shuriken that you can magically recall at any time, which incidentally allows you to hit enemies both from the front or from behind. It's available on an <a href="https://catskullgames.com/yo-yo-shuriken">actual, working SNES cartridge</a> with a cardboard box and manual, or you can buy a copy for emulation <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/yo-yo-shuriken">online</a>.</p>
