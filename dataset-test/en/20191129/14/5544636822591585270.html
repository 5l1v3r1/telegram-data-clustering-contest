      <p>Liverpool have revealed that Fabinho suffered ankle ligament damage against Napoli, which will rule the Brazil international out of action until 2020.</p>
      <p>The news comes as a huge blow to Jurgen Klopp’s plans, with the South American having become a key component in the Reds’ Premier League title-chasing side.</p>
      <p>With a packed schedule ahead of them, Liverpool would have been hoping to avoid any untimely setbacks, however, Fabinho will not be seen again for the remainder of the calendar year.</p>
      <p>That means that the 26-year-old will sit out important domestic fixtures in an ongoing bid for English top-flight glory, while also missing the Reds’ quest to claim the FIFA Club World Cup crown.</p>
      <p>No timescale has been put on his recovery, but those at Anfield are preparing themselves to be without one of the finest holding midfielders in the business for a prolonged period of time.</p>
      <p>A statement released on the club’s official website read: “Liverpool can confirm Fabinho suffered ankle ligament damage during the Champions League encounter with Napoli in midweek.</p>
      <p>“The midfielder needed to be substituted after 18 minutes of the 1-1 draw at Anfield on Wednesday night after falling awkwardly during a challenge.</p>
      <p>“Further assessment on the injury has discovered Fabinho will be out of action until the New Year.</p>
      <p>“The Brazilian will begin a rehabilitation programme with the Reds’ medical team at Melwood as he works his way back to full fitness.”</p>
      <p>Klopp admitted after witnessing Fabinho being forced from the field against Napoli that losing the Brazilian would be “massive” for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Former Reds star Harry Kewell has also been left cursing the club’s luck after seeing a man who has made rapid progress over recent months ruled out for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>He told Sky Sports: “It is a huge loss, he’s been the sponge.</p>
      <p>“He’s soaking everything up. When he receives the ball, he passes it forward – which many holding midfielders don’t do, that first pass forward to put your team on the attack.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big loss, but I’m confident in the squad that there are plenty to fill in.”</p>
      <p>The first game in which Liverpool will need to find cover for Fabinho is set to see them play host to Brighton on Saturday.</p>
