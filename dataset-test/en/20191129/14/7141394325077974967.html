      <h1>$20 Billion in Assets on the Move to New Blockchain in 2020 by British Powerhouse HSBC: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T14:45:19+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Blockchain technology will power a new platform launched by HSBC.</p>
      <p>Reuters reports that the British banking giant is releasing Digital Vault in 2020. The blockchain-based custody solution will grant investors real-time data for securities that are bought on private markets.</p>
      <p>Paper records primarily comprising private placement transactions will be swapped for blockchain records, making HSBC’s service one of the biggest deployments of the emerging technology, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-hldg-blockchain/hsbc-swaps-paper-records-for-blockchain-to-track-20-billion-worth-of-assets-idUSKBN1Y11X2">Reuters</a>.</p>
      <p>While HSBC is not revealing cost-benefit analysis figures to justify the move to a blockchain platform, the bank is anticipating a dramatic rise in the global value of private placements, which is expected to reach $7.7 trillion by 2022, up 60% from 2017.</p>
      <p>HSBC has been exploring blockchain technology as a means to streamline paper intensive procedures that involve redundancies and several intermediaries. In 2018, the British banking giant used blockchain technology to <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/01/15/hsbc-uses-blockchain-technology-to-complete-fx-transactions-worth-250-billion/">settle $250 billion</a> worth of foreign exchange trades.</p>
      <p>In September it also processed the first yuan-denominated blockchain-based letter of credit transaction. Commenting on the industry milestone at that time, Ajay Sharma, HSBC’s regional head of global trade and receivables finance for Asia-Pacific, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-hldg-blockchain/hsbc-processes-first-blockchain-letter-of-credit-using-chinese-yuan-idUSKCN1VN1QL">remarked</a>,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Clearly we are hoping that through this technology, the unit cost of doing a transaction comes down, along with other benefits, such as speed.”</i>
