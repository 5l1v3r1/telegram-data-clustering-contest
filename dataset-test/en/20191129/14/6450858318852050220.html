      <h1>Get 75% off lifetime cloud storage with pCloud’s Cyber Monday deal</h1>
      <h2>No subscription: just one up-front payment, then you have permanent cloud storage with this amazing deal from pCloud this Cyber Monday.</h2>

      <p>Cloud storage subscription prices are relatively cheap, but if you want a decent amount of storage the prices go up fast. And when you calculate the cost over a number of years, you’ll realise it isn’t particularly cheap at all.</p>
      <p>That’s why lifetime deals are tempting: you pay once, then the storage is yours to use indefinitely with no further charges.</p>
      <p>For Cyber Monday, pCloud has knocked a huge 75% off its two lifetime packages, which is a remarkable saving.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3779211-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fstorage%2Fpcloud-black-friday-deal-3779211%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpartner.pcloud.com%2Fr%2F18231">Get 75% off pCloud Lifetime here</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If 500GB will cover your needs, then that’s the cheapest option. It costs $122.50 (around £95) instead of $480 (£373).</p>
      <p>But for those needing more, there’s also a 2TB deal, which is usually $980. Take 75% off and it goes down to $245, which is a fantastic price for guaranteed safe storage. That’s about the price of 2TB SSD, and although you won’t get the super-fast transfer speeds because your broadband connection is a lot slower, the peace of mind you’ll have knowing that your data is safe is a worthwhile trade-off for many.</p>
      <p>Of course, cloud storage means you can access the stuff you store from any internet-connected device, and you can also automatically back up photos and videos you take on your phone straight to your pCloud account.</p>
      <p>Better still, these packages include 30 days’ file recovery, so you have a safety net if you accidentally delete something and then realise you need it.</p>
      <p>We’ve used pCloud for several years at Tech Advisor and have found it great to use and utterly reliable. And at these prices, it’s easy to recommend.</p>
