      <p>The men who raped and killed the 26-year-old Telangana doctor Wednesday night hatched the plan over drinks. They saw the woman parking her scooter near a toll plaza, one of them then punctured her scooter's tire when she was not around while another offered to help her fix it when she came back, telling her all repair shops were closed. They then raped her, killed her and set her on fire.</p>
      <p>The details of the gory crime that has made headlines across the country were revealed by the Cyberabad Police on Friday night. The police have arrested four accused in connection with the case. The accused have been identified as Mohammad Areef, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen, and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu.</p>
      <p>While 25-year-old Arif, the main accused in the Telangana rape and murder case, works as a driver, the other three accused - Jollu Shiva (20), Jollu Naveen (20) and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu -- work as lorry cleaners.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference a day after the charred body of the veterinary surgeon was found, Cyberabad Police Commissioner VC Sajjanar said they have taken four people into custody under Sections 376, 302 and other relevant sections of the IPC. The accused in the Telangana rape and murder case have also been booked under Nirbhaya Act.</p>
      <p>"After investigation four people were taken into custody at Shadnagar police station, their names are Mohammad Areef, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen, and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu," Cyberabad police commissioner said.</p>
      <p>The police said, on Thursday night, the accused were drinking close to the Shamshabad toll plaza when they saw the woman parking her scooter. The men hatched the plan to rape the woman over drinks. One of the accused, Naveen, punctured the rear wheel of her scooter when she was not around.</p>
      <p>When the Telangana doctor returned to take back her vehicle at 9:18 pm, she realised one of the tyres had a puncture. It was then Arif, the prime accused in the case, approached to help the doctor. She continued to refuse help.</p>
      <p>One of the accused, Jollu Shiva, took her scooter on the pretext of getting it repaired. He then came back after some time and told the woman that all the repair shops were closed.</p>
      <p>"They [the accused] raped the girl. She died because of accused had covered her mouth and nose during the crime," the Cyberabad police commissioner said. The accused then purchased petrol and burnt the victim's body.</p>
