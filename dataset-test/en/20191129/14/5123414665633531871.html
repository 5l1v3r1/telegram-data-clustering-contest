      <p>Ever wondered how the sounds for <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/video-games/">video games</a> are created and implemented? Well, if so, you’re in luck. <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/point-blank/">Point Blank</a>’s latest online tutorial taster demonstrates just this focusing on how to create footsteps for your video game. This video was narrated by Rory Walker, a Point Blank lecturer and freelance sound designer in the gaming industry</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in learning more about creating audio for games their online courses can help. In fact, this video was taken directly from their audio for games module which features in their online <a href="https://www.pointblankmusicschool.com/courses/online/">Diploma courses</a>.</p>
      <p>During the video, Rory uses Unity, a game design engine, and FMOD, an integrated game engine DAW, to demonstrate exactly how adding sound to games works. He sets a number of different parameters for the footprints including gravel, sand, stone and water to add variation to the character’s movement. </p>
