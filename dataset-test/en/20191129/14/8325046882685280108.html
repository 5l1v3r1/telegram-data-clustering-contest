        <li>Mississippi State won the Egg Bowl on Thursday against its archrival Ole Miss after the Rebels earned a late unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty for a celebration in which receiver Elijah Moore pretended to pee like a dog.</li>
        <li>The celebration pushed the tying extra-point attempt back 15 yards, and kicker Luke Logan pushed it wide, giving the Mississippi State Bulldogs the win.</li>
        <li>Oddly enough, it wasn’t the first time a peeing-dog celebration had been employed in the rivalry between the two teams.</li>

      <p>The Egg Bowl ended in dramatic, highly unusual fashion Thursday with Ole Miss missing a tying extra-point attempt against Mississippi State.</p>
      <p>The chaos started when Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral connected with wide receiver Elijah Moore, who found the end zone and brought the Rebels within a point of the Bulldogs, at 21-20, with just four seconds left on the clock.</p>
      <p>While celebrating his monumental score, Moore dropped to all fours and pretended to pee like a dog, earning himself an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty for excessive celebration.</p>

      <p>The penalty pushed the Rebels back 15 yards, effectively preventing them from attempting a two-point conversion to win the game and turning the chip-shot extra point into a far more harrowing kick.</p>
      <p>With the game hanging in the balance, kicker Luke Logan lined up the attempt but pushed it wide.</p>

      <p>After the game, Ole Miss was clearly disappointed with the outcome of the final sequence.</p>
      <p>“That’s not who we are. We’ve been a disciplined team all year, and so just disappointed that happened,” Rebels coach Matt Luke <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401110863">said</a>. “That’s not who he is. Elijah is a good kid, and he just got caught up in the moment.”</p>
      <p>On Twitter, fans reveled in the chaotic ending to the Thanksgiving rivalry game.</p>

      <p>Oddly enough, it was not the first time these teams had traded this specific celebration. In 2017, just two months after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/odell-beckham-jr-celebration-dog-peeing-giants-2017-9">Odell Beckham Jr. introduced the world to the post-touchdown dog pee</a>, then-Ole Miss receiver and current Seattle Seahawk <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/11/23/16695588/ole-miss-mississippi-state-dk-metcalf-peeing-dog">DK Metcalf re-created the celebration in the Egg Bowl</a>.</p>
      <p>Moore’s celebration was most likely intended as an homage to those who came before him but instead helped his team lose its biggest game of the year.</p>
