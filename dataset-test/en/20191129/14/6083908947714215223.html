      <h1>Throwback: That Time Obama's Press Secretary Was Asked About Hunter Biden and Burisma</h1>

      <p>For weeks, Democrats and their friends in the media have done everything possible to cover for former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's work with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Despite multiple government officials who served under President Obama and Trump citing Burisma as a concern and notoriously corrupt, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff refused to allow Republicans to call Hunter Biden as a witness during impeachment inquiry hearings last week. Questions about Hunter Biden's dealings, which included an $83,000 per month paycheck, have been brushed aside by the media as a political attack on Joe Biden, who is running for the White House.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't that long ago when questions about Hunter Biden's dealings, right under the nose of Vice President Biden who oversaw the Ukraine portfolio for the Obama administration, came under questioning during a White House Press briefing.</p>
      <p>"Hunter Biden has now taken a position with the largest oil and gas company holding company in Ukraine. Is there any concern about at least the appearance of, of a conflict there, to see the Vice President's son...," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked in 2014.</p>
      <p>"I would refer you to the vice presidentâ€™s office, I saw those reports. Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens and uh, where they work is not, does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the vice president or president. But I would refer you to the vice president's office," Carney said, deflecting the question.</p>

      <p>Last week Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2019/11/21/senator-graham-asks-the-state-department-of-documents-on-hunter-biden-burisma-n2556890">launched an investigation</a> into the Bidens and Burisma.
