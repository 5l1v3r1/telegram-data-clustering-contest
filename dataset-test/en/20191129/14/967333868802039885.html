      <p>Diver and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4BWGOxA5mH/">professional scuba instructor</a> Ocean Ramsey has been captured on video while swimming fearlessly near a 20-foot (6-metre) white shark. The video has gone viral and garnered more than nine million views.</p>
      <p>The girl, wearing a mask and flippers, is seen swimming near the large predator and films it with her a GoPro camera. She then touches the shark's pectoral fin with her left hand and follows it for several seconds. Judging by the video, the shark was left unfazed by its unexpected contact with a human.</p>
