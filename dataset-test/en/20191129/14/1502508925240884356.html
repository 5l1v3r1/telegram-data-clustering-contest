      <p>Former prime minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/manmohan-singh">Manmohan Singh </a>said on Friday the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gdp">GDP </a>growth rate of 4.5 per cent was unacceptable and worrisome, and urged his successor <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi </a>to set aside "deep-rooted suspicion" of society and nurse India back to harmonious, mutually trustworthy society that can help the economy soar.</p>
      <p>Delivering his valedictory address at a national conclave on economy, Singh said mutual trust is the bedrock of societal transactions fostering economic growth, but "our social fabric of trust, confidence is now torn and ruptured".</p>
      <p>He said the "toxic combination of deep distrust, pervasive fear and a sense of hopelessness in our society" is stifling economic activity and growth.</p>
