      <p>Amanda Hunter, who witnessed the shooting from a bus, told BBC News: "I was coming home on the 21 bus and all of all a sudden it stopped. There was some commotion and I looked out the window and I just saw these three police officers going over to a man. It seemed like there was something in his hand. I’m not 100% sure, but then one of the police officer shot him.</p>
      <p>"From there, I was able to take a video of the scene. We were stopped on the bus maybe for me a minute and a half and then we’re able to safely get off the bridge.</p>
      <p>"There was only three police officers at the time. But by the time I got off the bridge, that’s when I started to hearing the sirens.</p>
      <p>"I heard about three shots to get the man. Everyone was just kind of into shock."</p>
      <p>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "I’m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response."</p>
