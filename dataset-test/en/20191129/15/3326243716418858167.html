      <p>In this hands-on video walkthrough, we review Keychron’s excellent K2 mechanical keyboard specifically designed to be used with a Mac. <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/07/keychron-k2-overview/">As previously highlighted</a>, the keyboard includes such features as backlight, USB-C charging, wired or wireless operation, easy switching between Apple, Windows or Android layout when moving between devices, plus other perks.</p>
      <p>Could this be the perfect mechanical keyboard for your Mac? To find out the answer to that all-important question, be sure to watch the hands-on video walkthrough by our own Harris Craycraft that I’ve embedded right ahead, it only runs eight minutes long.</p>

      <p>I can attest to most, if not all of the pros and cons from Harris’s video review because Keychron kindly sent me a review sample so I’ve had some time to play with it, too.</p>
      <p>Below are a few other observations and important points that stood out for me.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With 94 keys and is a foot in length, it’s about two keys wider than Apple’s keyboard</li>
        <li>You can use it with an iPad, but it feels a bit out of place due to its thickness</li>
        <li>It comes with the included L-shaped USB-C cable for charging</li>
        <li>You can have up to three Bluetooth connections and quickly switch between them</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, some iPad keyboard shortcuts don’t work on this keyboard</li>
        <li>Each of the three switches has a 4mm key travel</li>
        <li>The blue switch is the clickiest option you can get</li>
        <li>It has a bit rounded rather than flat keys found on Keychron’s previous keyboards</li>
        <li>It’s got a bigger battery but lasts less than Apple’s aluminum keyboard</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Apple’s aluminum wireless keyboard is a bit more compact.</p>
