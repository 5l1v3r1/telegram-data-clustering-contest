      <h3>iPad</h3>
      <p>We’re seeing the biggest deals so far on the seventh-generation iPad, which is great because it recently released. As for why you should pick the new iPad over the sixth-generation model, it comes down to a little extra RAM, a bigger screen (10.2 inches versus 9.7 inches), and a Smart Connector port. Otherwise, you’ll find the same processor inside.</p>
      <p>The seventh-gen iPad with 32GB of storage costs $249.99 right now at <a href="https://amzn.to/2KMSaIg">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-32gb-space-gray%2F5985609.p%3FskuId%3D5985609">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-10-2-inch-wi-fi-only-7th-generation%2F-%2FA-78305935%3Flnk%3DiPadnew&amp;referrer=theverge.com">Target</a>. If you want more storage, the 128GB model is $329.99 (usually $429.99) at <a href="https://amzn.to/35xoMgW">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-128gb-gold%2F5985616.p%3FskuId%3D5985616">Best Buy</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>iPad Air, iPad mini, and other models that you won’t see big discounts on for Black Friday <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event&amp;referrer=theverge.com">come with a $50 gift card</a> at Apple</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>iPhone</h3>
      <p>We aren’t seeing deals on the unlocked iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max. However, several retailers will be discounting them via activation with carriers.</p>
      <p>Starting on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, if you’re looking for a discount on an iPhone 11 Pro, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fiphone%2Fshop-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-iphone-11-pro-max%2Fpcmcat1568147641595.c&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574607249343fha">you may be able to buy one for as little as $499 (roughly half off)</a>, but only if you activate a new line with an installment plan on Verizon, AT&amp;T, or Sprint and also trade in your old phone. How much you pay overall will depend on how much trade-in value your phone has. After activating it and trading in your old phone, the final cost for the iPhone 11 after your installment plan is paid off <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fiphone-11%3Firclickid%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26acampID%3D614286&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574607249343hfj">will be $199</a>.</p>
      <p>Over at Target, the iPhone deals kick off on Black Friday and last through Sunday. You can get a $200 gift card when you activate either the <a href="https://fave.co/2Qn7m2e">iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max</a> with Verizon or AT&amp;T. Target will also offer a $200 gift card for the <a href="https://fave.co/2O8o2YF">iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max</a>, which cost less per month than the iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max.</p>
