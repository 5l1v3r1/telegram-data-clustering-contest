      <p>Music Producer, Quophi Okyeame, has rooted for Kofi Kinaata to be nominated in the Gospel Song of the Year category in next year’s VGMA’s.</p>
      <p>Okyeame Quophi in a phone-in interview with Andy Dosty on Hitz FM’s Daybreak Hitz urged that award schemes should consider nominating rapper Kofi Kinaata’ ‘Things Fall Apart’ in one of the Gospel categories in 2020.</p>
      <p>In his assertion, the song is a “marvellous” song that deserves to be put in Gospel Song of the Year category.</p>
      <p><i><b>“The words that proceed out of his mouth and the effect they have on society are in rhythmic rhyme with the book of life,”</b></i> he added.</p>
      <p>His comments come after Although Creative Arts Council President, Mark Okraku Mantey and Rev Abraham Lamptey began a debate on who a Gospel singer is and what a Gospel song is.</p>
      <p>According to Mark Okraku, choosing songs for nominations is purely technical and has nothing to do with the message, whiles Rev Abraham was of the view that the message in a song is critical in determining what a Gospel song is.</p>
      <p>Quophi Okyeame was quick to add that the message in ‘Things Fall Apart’ is no different from <i><b>“when Reverend met a woman who was trying to cross the road, he got down and helped.</b></i> adding that Kofi Kinaata’s Things Fall Apart deserves to be considered for a Gospel Song regardless of the technicalities.</p>
      <p><i><b>“if we are talking about awards schemes and categorisation and trying to find the perfect definition of what gospel is then Kofi Kinaata qualifies for that particular song to be nominated as a gospel song,”</b></i> he said.</p>
