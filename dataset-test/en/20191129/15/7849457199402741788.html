      <p>Police Brigadier General Bernard Banac, PNP spokesperson, said the statement of the President only emphasized how serious the national government was in its campaign against illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>“Huwag pong mabahala ang publiko. Ang ganitong pahayag ng Pangulo ay pagbibigay lamang ng diin, pagiging seryoso sa kampanya kontra droga (The public should not be worried. The statement of the President is just an emphasis on how serious [the government is] in the campaign against illegal drugs),” Banac said.</p>
      <p>Banac added that the President is known to issue controversial remarks about the drug war which he said could be interpreted in a number of ways.</p>
      <p>“Sa PNP, ang ating pagtanaw ay pagbibigay ng emphasis sa pagtugis ng high value targets (In the PNP, we look at [teh recent statements] as emphasis that we should run after high value targets),” Banac said.</p>
      <p>The police official said that he had no knowledge if what the President said was indeed true.</p>
      <p>“Wala naman tayong ulat na may ganoong pangyayari na pinatungkulan ang Pangulo) We have not received a report about that incident involving the President),” Banac said.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Duterte unapologetically said that he threw corpses of drug lords into the Manila Bay, and Laguna de Bay, and into a deep ravine in Mountain Province.</p>
      <p>He made the remarks to reject criticisms that no big fish were caught in his drug war.</p>
      <p>“Do I have to advertise that?” Duterte was quoted as saying.</p>
