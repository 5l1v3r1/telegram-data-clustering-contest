      <h1>Black Friday 'ruined' by NatWest banking outage, customers complain, after it leaves them unable to access accounts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:20:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/helena-horton/" target="_blank">Helena Horton</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday was "ruined" by a Natwest banking outage, customers have complained after being unable to access their bank accounts.</p>
      <p>On what was also payday for some people being the last Friday of the month, some also said that money they had transferred between accounts appeared to have vanished.</p>
      <p>Online banking and mobile banking was down all day, with people unable to make large purchases and businesses affected.</p>
      <p>Philippa Smith wrote on Twitter: "Supposed to sell our flat and buy a house today, our solicitor banks with NatWest.</p>
      <p>"When will this be sorted? Packed up and nowhere to go."</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user, Janine Daniels, wrote: "Money missing from my savings now after a failed transfer sitting in the hairdressers can’t pay for my hair absolutely appalling. Had many Black Friday deals I had planned to buy my children now out of stock absolutely disgusting".</p>
      <p>Another, Helen, wrote: "Well that's one way of making sure I don't spend to much on Black Friday, stop me being able to access my money. Thanks Nat West"</p>
      <p>Brandon Leigh, from south Manchester, told Sky News the NatWest failure has impacted his business.</p>
      <p>He runs a first-aid training business and planned to buy 36 mannequins and equipment at a 20 per cent Black Friday discount.</p>
      <p>He told Sky News: "For me, it's a big saving. We went to the supplier but I can't pay them. It's terrible, I need them.</p>
      <p>"I rang NatWest and was held in a queue for ages. They said they are working on the problems and it would be sorted, but not in the next hour or two. I can't get in the mobile app, or internet banking."</p>
      <p>The RBS Group said in a statement: "We are aware that some customers are experiencing intermittent issues accessing our mobile and online banking.</p>
      <p>"We apologise to customers for the inconvenience and are working hard to fix the problem. There is no impact on debit cards, credit cards, ATMs, telephone and branch banking services - customers can continue to access these as normal."</p>
      <p>Research from Which? released earlier this week found the banking industry suffers around five IT failures each week typically, shutting millions of customers out of accounts and making payments.</p>
      <p>Which? found that over the past year, major UK banks suffered 265 IT shutdowns between them that prevented customers from making payments.</p>
      <p>TSB recently apologised to its customers after some account holders were left without their salaries as the bank failed to process overnight payments.</p>
      <p>Last year, a major IT meltdown left TSB customers without access to services and dragged on for months.</p>
