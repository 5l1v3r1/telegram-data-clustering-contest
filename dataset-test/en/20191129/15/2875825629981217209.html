      <h1>Jacqueline Jossa's mum and Dan Osborne ignore each other despite sharing hotel</h1>
      <h2>Dan Osborne and his daughters are staying in Australia with Jacqueline Jossa's family as they support her I'm A Celebrity stint</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:25:20+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Dan Osborne has been accused of ignoring his mother-in-law despite sharing hotel with her and the rest of Jacqueline Jossa's family as they wait for her to finish her I'm A Celebrity stint.</p>
      <p>Even though Dan and Selina Jossa have been sharing childcare of Dan and Jac's two daughters, Mia and Ella, they've each kept their social media feeds free of each other.</p>
      <p>Selina and her husband John Jossa have been sharing snaps of themselves hanging out at the plush five-star Palazzo Versace, where Dan is also staying.</p>
      <p>But even though they all arrived on the same flight to Brisbane airport, Selina and Dan have pointedly not included each other in their <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> updates.</p>

      <p>Both, however, have been sharing plenty of snaps of the girls.</p>
      <p>After Wednesday night's episode, Jacqueline's parents posed outside the Palazzo's sunny courtyard and wrote: "We're here for #junglejac come on our girl your doing great."</p>
      <p>The family also posed for a snap on the plane from Heathrow Airport with their granddaughters, but Dan was missing from the social media snap.</p>
      <p>He has been busy updating his own followers with posts of him supporting Jacqueline through her various ordeals in camp.</p>
      <p>During the nightly episodes, Dan has taken to his Instagram to share his live reactions with fans and keep them updated on how he's coping without his wife-of-two years.</p>

      <p>The EastEnders actress suffered major heartbreak during her time on the show after campmate Myles Stephenson, 28, told her Dan, 28, had a fling with Love Island star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> last year, something both deny.</p>
      <p>But as he arrived at Brisbane aiport this week, Dan insisted Jacqueline had "nothing to worry about".</p>
      <p>"Listen, she is my wife, I have got nothing to worry about, nothing to think about. I am just coming out to support her and that is the only reason I am here," he told the Mirror.</p>
      <p>"I am just excited to see her and the last person on my mind is Myles or anyone else."</p>
      <p>Asked if he had anything to say to Myles, who dated Gabby, 27, Dan said: "Nah. I have got nothing to say to him or anything else, only my wife."</p>

      <p>After Myles had dripped poison in her ear, Jacqueline insisted on contacting Dan from the Iâ€™m A Celebrity camp to clear the air.</p>
      <p>Dan, who also has a five-year-old son, Teddy, said: "She is a great mum and she does loads. It is a lot tougher without her but we have done all right, it has been good, it will just be nice to have their mum back.</p>
      <p>"What would I like to say to her? That life is a lot harder without you. That I miss you and you have done amazing and I will see you when you get out of there.</p>
      <p>"I can't wait to see her," he added.</p>
