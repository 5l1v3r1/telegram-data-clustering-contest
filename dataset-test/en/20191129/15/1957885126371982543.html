      <h2>Update: Others top offers for the Xbox One S All-Digital.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:14:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Wen</a></address>
      <p>We were all very excited to discover in the run-up to Black Friday that it would be possible to get an Xbox One S All-Digital Edition for £129 this year. Many retailers were stocking it, but then a stockist swooped in an put the console up for £99. Understandably, it sold out within minutes - and anyone who missed out is left with a sad look upon their face.</p>
      <p>The All-Digital Edition includes the 1TB console and controller, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-18-minecraft-review">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-27-sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a> and a Fortnite bundle featuring 2000 V-Bucks and a legendary Rogue Spider Knight outfit.</p>
      <p>Never fear if you missed out, though, as we're on hand to find you the next best price on the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition. Sadly, I can't promise that there will be another £99 mega-deal but I will try my best. Here's what I've seen so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/en/1tb-xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition-and-now-tv-2691337">1TB Xbox One S All-Digital Edition for £129 from Game</a>

      <p>Even at £129, which is about £100 off what many retailers were charging for the bundle previously. This is easily one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-12-02-xbox-cyber-monday-black-friday-2019-the-best-xbox-one-consoles">best Xbox Black Friday deals</a> out there.</p>
      <p>We should also emphasise that this is the All-Digital version of the console so you won't be able to play any game discs. But with Xbox Game Pass, you'll instantly expand your access to over 100 games that you can download straight to your 1TB hard drive. With the latest first-party titles included at launch, such as Gears 5 and The Outer Worlds, the Xbox Game Pass really is one of the best value gaming subscription services going.</p>
      <p>Microsoft already offers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0/000F">3 months Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for just £1</a> if you're a new member.
