        <i>Following the trend of raunchy direct-to-video sex comedies popularized in the early to mid 80s, director Rick Sloane (Hobgoblins) decided to take his own stab at the sub-genre, creating the surprise hit franchise VICE ACADEMY in 1989. Featuring the comedic exploits of undercover female vice cops who go head-to-head with everything from smut film producers to arch villainesses with plans for sexual world domination, each film mixes T&amp;A with broad slapstick humor and hijinks.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Starring iconic scream queen Linnea Quigley (Night of the Demons) and erotic film legend Ginger Lynn Allen (Trashy Lady), the VICE ACADEMY series was a staple of late-night TV throughout the early to mid 90s. Known for their absurd plot lines and surprisingly robust and colorful visuals, Vinegar Syndrome Archive presents VICE ACADEMY 1-3 all newly restored in 2K from their original 35mm camera negatives and together in one handy collection.</i>

      </p>
      <p>
        <i>A rough n’ tumble biker themed action film which evokes the feeling of AIP’s 60s classics, though filtered through a nudity, violence, and crazy stunt fueled Cannon-era sensibility, Simon Nuchtern’s SAVAGE DAWN stars Lance Henriksen (The Terminator, Aliens), George Kennedy (Death Ship), Karen Black (Easy Rider), and Richard Lynch (Invasion USA). Featuring heavily gelled cinematography by Gerald Fiel and a score by Pino Donaggio (Dressed to Kill), Vinegar Syndrome Archive is proud to present the world Blu-ray debut of SAVAGE DAWN, newly restored from its original 35mm camera negative.</i>

But Tammy’s jealous ex, Billy, won’t stand for anyone coming between him and ‘his’ girl, so he and his friends kidnap Michael, leaving him to be mauled by a lion in a local wildlife reserve. Comatose and at death’s door, Michael’s body is stolen from the hospital by mad scientist Dr. Wachenstein, who extracts his brain and implants it into a giant robotic T-Rex. Horrified by his predicament and new dinosaur body, he escapes from the doctor’s lab and begins brutally killing his former bullies. Meanwhile Tammy and her best friend Byron start searching for a suitable human corpse in which to re-transplant Michael’s brain…</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <i>After their car breaks down, a group of travelers find themselves stranded in a remote part of New England.  After taking shelter in a spooky old mansion, complete with a graveyard, they discover a ouija board and decide to spend the night attempting to summon some spirits. But the group soon learns that playing with the forces of black magic isn’t fun and games, and it’s not long before they’re head-to-head with all sorts of demonic creatures, shape shifters, and other forms of evil, all of whom are more than happy to pick them off in the most gruesome of ways.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Of all of the bizarre horror films made in the 1980s, SPOOKIES easily ranks among the weirdest. Produced by Michael Lee, founder of the adored UK home video distributor VIPCO, the film became a fan favorite thanks to its expertly rendered creature effects and notorious for its bizarre production history in which its original creators, co-writers/directors Brendan Faulkner &amp; Thomas Doran and co-writer/producer Frank M. Farel, were fired and replaced by Eugenie Joseph, who added new scenes and re-edited the previously shot footage, resulting in the legendary oddity SPOOKIES has become. Vinegar Syndrome proudly brings SPOOKIES to Blu-ray for the first time, newly restored in 4K from its long lost original negative and including a brand new, feature-length ‘making of’ documentary, charting its incredible and often unbelievable production history.</i>
