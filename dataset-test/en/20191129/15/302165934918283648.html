      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 29 — Shoppers headed out to stores across the United States in a quest to score the best Black Friday discounts, with early promotions marking the start of a condensed holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>The following are quotes from shoppers and store managers in the midst of America’s biggest shopping day.</p>
      <p>JAY SMITH, 28, SHOPPING AT A MACY’S IN PENTAGON CITY:</p>
      <p>“I think there were some good deals but overall the discounts are similar to what we have seen in the past.”</p>
      <p>Evan Houser, 22, ELECTRONICS SALESMAN AT TARGET IN DOWNTOWN CHICAGO:</p>
      <p>“It’s slow now because we had a big, big rush last night – we had a line around the block from like 4:30.”</p>
      <p>RACHEL BOOKMAN, 33, SHOPPING AT A BANANA REPUBLIC:</p>
      <p>“The deals are the same online and frankly there are more of them online, so the question increasingly is why come to the mall at all?”</p>
      <p>DICK DOYLE, 76, SHOPPING AT MODELLS SPORTING GOODS:</p>
      <p>“I will come to the mall, look at prices and o back and check them online. Prices and discounts online are competitive to what’s available in stores.”</p>
      <p>SHARIDA GALLOWAY, 48, SHOPPING AT A WALMART IN CHICAGO ON THANKSGIVING:</p>
      <p>“There were people here since 4 o’clock ... I had to wait in line to get in ... I feel bad. They should limit what people can get. People got six TVs in their car ... they should have set a limit, like two per family – give everyone a chance to get things.”</p>
      <p>ANTHONY WRIGHT JR, 26, SHOPPING AT BEST BUY:</p>
      <p>“We literally drove by at 2 o’clock after looking at YouTube videos of people sleeping outside. There weren’t really a lot of people so we went back home and came back around six.”</p>
      <p>JAVIER ANAYA, 20, SHOPPING AT A TARGET IN CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA:</p>
      <p>“I just got my paycheck and came here. For three years now I’ve bought a new TV on Black Friday. I was looking for one to replace the one I had. I dropped it during a move.”</p>
      <p>NANCY ESTRADA, 21, SHOPPING FOR PLAYSTATION 4 WIRELESS HEADPHONES AND A CONTROLLER FOR AT A BEST BUY IN CULVER CITY:</p>
      <p>“I’m comparing this with Amazon prices on Cyber Monday,” flashing her mobile phone.</p>
      <p>BRYON TOLENTINO, 33, HEAD OF THE STATIONERY DEPARTMENT AT A WALMART IN CHICAGO ON THANKSGIVING:</p>
      <p>“I don’t expect that many people tomorrow ... they’ll know we’ve run out of the main products with the deals like the TVs ... I thought it’d be so crowded you couldn’t even walk. I haven’t heard of any fighting, any arguments.”</p>
