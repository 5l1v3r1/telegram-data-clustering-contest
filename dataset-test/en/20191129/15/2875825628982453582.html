      <p>The beauty recently revealed she is not ready to date yet after Tristan was caught cheating on her with her sister Kylie's best friend Jordyn Woods.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Jay Shetty's On Purpose podcast, Khloe addressed the speculation of the cheating scandal, saying: "About eight months ago, I had a breakup and so figuring out, I think people are so good at distracting and I've really chosen to not distract myself or try to not distract myself.</p>
      <p>"Maybe people would say True would be a distraction, but if anything, she's a healthy distraction."</p>

      <p>Khloe is now blossoming in single life and recently admitted that she is "so in love" with her daughter True, that she doesn't need another man to muscle in on her affections.</p>
      <p>She said while she has forgiven him for being unfaithful and that she puts her daughter, True, first when it comes to co parenting, she isn't jumping back into the dating scene.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one explained: "I haven't jumped into dating. I don't care to date right now. I'm not in a rush for it,.</p>
      <p>"I feel so good in my life and I don't really need much else."</p>
