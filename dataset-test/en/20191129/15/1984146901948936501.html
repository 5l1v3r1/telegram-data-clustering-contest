      <p>The Premier League have this afternoon confirmed that David Pemsel has resigned from his role as chief executive.</p>
      <p>Pemsel wasn’t due to start until February, but has now taken the decision to step down following reports in the media about his private life.</p>
      <p>Appointed in October as Richard Scudamore’s successor, Pemsel was the third person to be offered the role, but as a result of his resignation, the Premier League are now having to reopen their search for Scudamore’s successor, 540 days after he announced he was quitting.</p>
      <p>A statement from the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> on Friday afternoon read: “Following media disclosures earlier this week and discussions with David Pemsel, the Premier League has today accepted David’s resignation and he will no longer be joining as Chief Executive.</p>
      <p>“Richard Masters will continue as Interim Chief Executive.No further comment will be made at this stage.”</p>
