      <p>Police Senior Master Sergeant Jason Magno, of Initao Police Station, perished on Thursday when he jumped on a grenade to shield students and onlookers from being hit by shrapnels.</p>
      <p>The grenade was detonated by the 65-year-old suspect, Ebrahim Ampaso Basher, who was eventually shot dead by Magno’s wounded buddy, PSMS Alice Balido.</p>
      <p>“PSMS Magno made a supreme sacrifice by covering the grenade with his own body to save innocent civilian lives. He truly lives up to his sworn duty, to serve and protect even if it costs his life,” said Police Brigadier General Bernard Banac, PNP spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Banac said that Basher initially had a heated argument with a local employee of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) due to “personal problem”.</p>
      <p>“May dala itong patalim at hinahabol ang [DENR employee]. Hindi niya matagpuan ang hinahanap kaya pilit niyang binuksan ang opisina ng DENR, pinagsasaksak ang pintuan (The suspect had a knife while running after the DENR employee. However, he could not find the employee so he went to the DENR office and stabbed the door repeatedly),” Banac said.</p>
      <p>Concerned students and individuals tried to pacify the suspect but he pulled out a grenade and threatened to detonate it if the employee won’t see him.</p>
      <p>This prompted the students to call the police.</p>
      <p>Magno and Balido then responded to the scene which led to the former wrestling with Basher for possession of the grenade.</p>
      <p>Unknown to Magno, Basher had already pulled the safety pin of the grenade as he lobbed the grenade to the ground.</p>
      <p>It must have been due to Magno’s instincts that he covered the grenade with his body to prevent it from harming other students as it exploded, Banac said.</p>
      <p>Wounded by shrapnel after the grenade blast, Balido then single-handedly confronted Basher and shot him dead. At least 15 others, mostly students, got wounded in the blast, police said.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant General Archie Gamboa, PNP officer in charge, expressed condolences to the bereaved family of Magno.</p>
      <p>Banac said Magno’s family was assured of financial support since he was killed while in the line of duty.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, the LGU Initao said it was mourning the loss of Magno who they described as a “great individual.”</p>
      <p>“We mourn for the loss of a great individual in the person of PSMS Jason Janog Magno Rest assured, PSMS Magno will be honored and remembered as a hero for his unselfish act,” LGU Initao said.</p>
      <p>LGU Initao assured the public that the grenade blast in Initao College was an “isolated case.”</p>
      <p>“We have personnel from the PNP, Military and other members from the Peace and Order Council to assist in securing the vicinity of INCHS to ensure safety of the general public,” they added.</p>
      <p>The surviving kin of Magno will receive death benefits such as P250,000 from the Presidential Social Fund; P141,000 to P181,000 from the PNP Special Financial Assistance; P50,000 as burial benefits; and P200,000 gratuity from the National Police Commission.</p>
      <p>As a member of the Public Safety Mutual Benefit Fund, Magno’s family may also be entitled to death insurance, Banac said.</p>
      <p>He stated that the benefits are on top of the estimated P15,000 monthly lifetime pension from the PNP and roughly the same amount of pension for five years from the Napolcom.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Balido will also get financial assistance as she was wounded while in the line of duty.</p>
