      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - High pressure will build north of the state during the next couple days, increasing the trade winds to breezy and locally windy levels over the weekend.</p>
      <p>A fairly dry trade wind pattern will prevail through Saturday, with showers favoring windward and mauka areas and the stray leeward spillover.</p>
      <p>A notable increase in shower coverage is expected late Saturday night through Sunday, with rather wet conditions in windward areas and passing showers in leeward locales.</p>
      <p>The trades will ease slightly but remain moderate to locally breezy next week, with a more typical trade wind shower pattern featuring windward showers and the occasional shower reaching leeward areas.</p>
      <p>A storm passing far north near the Gulf of Alaska will be sending out an elevated north swell towards the islands.</p>
      <p>Mixed in with the north, is an elevated shorter period northeast swell.</p>
      <p>The north swell will be spreading down the islands between Saturday and Sunday, peak late Sunday into early Monday, then lower late Monday through Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The shorter period northeast pulse peaks earlier, on Sunday morning. Then, between Monday and Tuesday, there will be a series of smaller northeast pulses but with longer period.</p>
      <p>Surf will exceed advisory levels and could approach low end warning levels during the peak of these swells along north and east facing shores.</p>
