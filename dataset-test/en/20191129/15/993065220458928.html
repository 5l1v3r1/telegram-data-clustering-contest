      <p>A WEST Belfast man with almost 100 convictions has been handed a five-year sentence for having a gun and cocaine.</p>
      <p>John Neale (52), of Clonfaddan Street, will serve half his sentence in jail and the remaining 30 months on supervised licence after his release.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty at Belfast Crown Court to possessing a firearm in suspicious circumstances, buying the weapon and having it without a certificate.</p>
      <p>Neale also admitted possessing a quantity of cocaine with intent to supply.</p>
      <p>Prosecution barrister David Russell said that after he was arrested in Belfast city centre on another matter in September 2018, police carried out a search of his home.</p>
      <p>Under a mattress in a bedroom, officers found a Browning 9mm self-loading handgun inside a plastic bag.</p>
      <p>They also recovered three bags of cocaine in a coat weighing 744 grammes which had a purity level of up to six per cent and a street value of between Â£35-40,000.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the bag containing the firearm was examined and found to contain Neale's DNA.</p>
      <p>Mr Russell told Judge Kevin Finnegan that he had a total of 99 previous convictions for a "range of offences'' including hijacking and robbery.</p>
      <p>Defence QC Eilis McDermott said the only forensic evidence linking Neale to the firearm was his DNA on the outside of the bag.</p>
      <p>"There is no evidence he handled the firearm. Swab tests and fingerprint examination showed no forensic link between him and the weapon. No ammunition was found for the firearm.''</p>
      <p>Handing down a five-year sentence for the firearm offences, Judge Finnegan imposed a concurrent sentence of three years for possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply.</p>
      <p>The judge granted a prosecution application for a destruction order on the firearm and drugs.</p>
