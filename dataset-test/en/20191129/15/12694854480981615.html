      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S10 Black Friday: Exclusive code gets you a free phone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:55:03+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Max Parker</a></address>

        <b>Black Friday is here and we’ve got a very special deal for the excellent Samsung Galaxy S10 here and when you use our exclusive code you get the usual £19.99 upfront fee chopped off. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Our EXCLUSIVE code ‘<b>TRUSTEDBF2′ </b>will get a Samsung Galaxy S10 for free (saving just under £20), and then £34 per month from Fonehouse. Impressive stuff for an Android phone we called ‘the perfect mixture of size and feature-set’ in our review.</p>
      <p>For that £34 you’re getting 100GB data per month along with unlimited texts and minutes.  To add the code just click the link below and then click ‘Have a voucher code?’. Easy.</p>
      <p>We continually check thousands of prices to show you the best deals. If you buy a product through our site we will earn a small commission from the retailer – a sort of automated referral fee – but our reviewers are always kept separate from this process.

      <p>For a quick spec overview, the S10 includes a curved OLED 5.8-inch display and a high-end Exynos chipset. There’s also a trio of cameras on the back and an update incoming for <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-q-features-2-3674497">Android 10</a> coming soon after the current beta phase.</p>
      <p>We raved about the Samsung Galaxy S10 in our review from earlier in the year, giving the phone 4.5/5 in our review. We noted how the smaller size was nice when compared to some other flagships and how the camera offered plenty of versatility. We also praised the lovely OLED screen, which is one of the best around.</p>
      <p>Our verdict read: “While the Samsung Galaxy S10 doesn’t excel in any one specific area, the collective package makes for an incredibly capable offering – which I’m sure was Samsung’s aim in the first place. It sports a stunning OLED screen, versatile camera and a number of enticing new features.”</p>
      <p>You’ll also get all the usual benefits of a Three contract like Go Binge and the use of your data abroad. You could say this is one of the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-28-11-3958979">best Black Friday deals</a>.</p>
