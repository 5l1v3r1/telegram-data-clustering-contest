      <p>President Donald Trump declared on Thanksgiving Day that U.S. peace negotiations with the Taliban have resumed after the talks <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-cancel-meeting-taliban">collapsed</a> in September.</p>
      <p>Trump made the sudden announcement during a secret trip to Afghanistan, his first visit to the war-torn country, to meet with American troops and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.</p>
      <p>“The Taliban wants to make a deal, and we’re meeting with them,” Trump said, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/politics/trump-afghanistan.html?searchResultPosition=2">New York Times</a>. “We’re going to stay until such time as we have a deal, or we have total victory, and they want to make a deal very badly.”</p>
      <p>The President gave few other details of the negotiations apparently underway.</p>
      <p>White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham had told the Times Trump’s unannounced trip was “nothing about the peace process,” merely “Thanksgiving and supporting the troops.”</p>
      <p>Several months ago, Trump shocked lawmakers on both sides of the aisle when he <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-cancel-meeting-taliban">announced</a> that he had secretly extended, then cancelled, an invitation to Taliban leaders to hammer out peace negotiations at Camp David.</p>
      <p>Republicans, including House Republican leader Liz Cheney (R-WY), <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/republicans-criticize-trump-meeting-taliban-camp-david-911">slammed</a> Trump’s planned meeting.</p>
      <p>“Camp David is where America’s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,” Cheney tweeted. “No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.”</p>
