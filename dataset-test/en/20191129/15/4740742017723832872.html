      <h1>Hundreds of buildings may be without water 'because too many people boiled kettles'</h1>
      <h2>Businesses on Quay Street were among the buildings which lost water</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:15:08+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Conor Gogarty</a></address>
      <p>Around 200 buildings in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-centre">Bristol city centre</a> may have been left without water because of too many people boiling kettles at the same times, a Bristol Water spokeswoman says.</p>
      <p>Quay Street Diner tweeted this morning (November 29) to announce it is closed due to losing water supply <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/burst-water-main-live-restaurant-3592024">after a main burst</a>.</p>
      <p>Bristol Water confirmed businesses in Quay Street were affected, as well as the bottom of the road on College Green and a large section of the A38 near Baldwin Street.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the company estimated 200 properties have been affected by the burst.</p>
      <p>She added: “The cause is not known as such, but it is quite common with the colder weather.</p>
      <p>“We can get ground movements. It can even be little things like when everyone boils their kettle at the same time.”</p>
      <p>Ben Newby, chief customer officer at Bristol Water, said at 2.45pm: “The water supply has now been restored to Quay Street.</p>
      <p>“We’re on track to have Colston Avenue and Rupert Street back in supply within the next two hours. We can only apologise for this disruption and thank the public for their ongoing patience.</p>
      <p>“If you have a medical condition or disability, sign up for our Priority Services Register and we can deliver water directly to you during a supply interruption.”</p>
