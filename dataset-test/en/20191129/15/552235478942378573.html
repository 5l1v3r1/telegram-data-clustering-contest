      <h2>Several players have voluntarily played through the pain barrier in recent weeks to help maintain the Buffs' strong start to the season.</h2>

      <p>Kilwinning Rangers are poised to bolster an injury-hit squad by dipping back into the transfer market.</p>
      <p>Buffs boss Chris Strain was hoping to bring in at least one new face before tomorrow's league trip to Largs.</p>
      <p>Several players have voluntarily played through the pain barrier in recent weeks to help maintain Kilwinning’s strong start to the season.</p>
      <p>A patched-up side beat Kilbirnie Ladeside 2-1 on Saturday to go eight points clear at the top but Strain admits it’s a risky game for his league leaders to play.</p>
      <p>He said: “We don’t have the biggest of squads and since the Pollok game we’ve had boys play through wee niggles and injuries.</p>
      <p>“The chairman has said if we find the right fit at the right price then bringing someone in is a possibility.</p>
      <p>“We’re in discussions with one or two so hopefully something can happen this week.”</p>
      <p>Buffs head to Barrfields Park in a hastily arranged West Premiership fixture.</p>

      <p>They were due to play Irvine Meadow who are now on Scottish Junior Cup replay duty after a 0-0 draw with Glenafton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We were expecting a free week, said Strain, “It seems a bit of a rushed fixture.</p>
      <p>“Both ourselves and Largs have played half our games and we only played a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit of a strange one but we’ll just get the head down and adopt a siege mentality.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we will have a few boys back. I’ll leave it up to the players to tell me if they’re fit enough to play.”</p>
      <p>“We had five or six players out (against Kilbirnie) who were all doubts ahead of kick-off.</p>
      <p>“I had boys coming to me in midweek saying they didn’t think they’d be able to play but they put their shoulder to the wheel and got on with it.</p>
      <p>“It was a really brave performance full of guts and determination."</p>
