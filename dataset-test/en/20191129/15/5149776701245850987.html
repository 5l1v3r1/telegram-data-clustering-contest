      <h1>Home of Nottingham Forest star Matty Cash burgled while he was away with the Reds</h1>
      <h2>'The criminals knew I was away with Forest which is very concerning and they took the opportunity to invade my privacy'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:58:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest ace Matty Cash says thieves stole personal possessions from his home while he was away helping the Reds to an emphatic 4-0 win away at QPR.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old said the items meant a great deal to him and he felt targeted.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I’m very disappointed and shocked by the whole situation," he said.</p>
      <p>"I live in an area which has a great community spirit and there are lots of Forest fans who I regularly see and always have time for.</p>
      <p>"The criminals knew I was away with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> which is very concerning and they took the opportunity to invade my privacy.</p>
      <p>"I urge whoever was responsible to return my personal possessions that were taken as they mean so much to me and my family."</p>
      <p>Police say they're investigating a report of a burglary which happened between 5pm on Wednesday, November 27, and 2am on Thursday, November 28, when the incident was reported.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Steve Wragg, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a>, said: "The residents of the property were not at the address at the time of the incident, during which a number of personal items were stolen.</p>
      <p>"Our enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who has any information about the burglary to contact Nottinghamshire Police as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>The incident is being investigated by one of the force's burglary teams, set up in April last year.</p>

      <p>Insp Wragg added: "We know that burglaries are an unacceptable invasion of people's homes, which is a place that we believe our communities should be able to feel safest.</p>
      <p>“That is why it is absolutely crucial that, where incidents are reported to us, the public can have faith that their reports will be taken seriously, that they will be thoroughly investigated and that we will pursue those responsible."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information which may help the investigation is asked to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident 39 of November 28.</p>
      <p>Cash, who lives locally, has flourished this season at right-back and pledged his long-term future to the club, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-matty-cash-contract-3589842">signing a new three-and-a-half-deal</a> on Thursday (November 28).</p>
      <p>He has been one of the most consistent performers during the Reds' impressive Championship campaign and featured in the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/qpr-nottingham-forest-live-score-3581314">confident win against QPR on Wednesday</a> as Forest went fourth in the table, with a game in hand.</p>
