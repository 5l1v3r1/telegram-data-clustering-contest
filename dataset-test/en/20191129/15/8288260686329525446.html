      <h1>Eagle-eyed Aldi shoppers spot 'worst deal of Black Friday' - and it's laughable</h1>
      <h2>The deal, courtesy of Aldi, has sparked plenty of raised eyebrows from shoppers</h2>

      <p>Ever since opening its first store in the UK right here in Birmingham, Aldi has gone from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>The budget supermarket boasts a staggering number of stores across the country - including plenty here in Brum.</p>
      <p>It opened its first branch in the Second City back in the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>And ever since, it has gone on to garner a legion of fans, all of whom love the chain's easy to navigate store layout, cheap items and wallet-friendly prices.</p>
      <p>But as Black Friday is celebrated across the country, one shopper may have spotted the worst deal so far.</p>
      <p>The deal, courtesy of Aldi, has sparked plenty of raised eyebrows from shoppers, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/aldi-black-friday-blunder-funny-17337745">Manchester Evening News.</a></p>
      <p>Twitter user @Spod1000 posted the photos of a stack of McVitie’s biscuits, calling it the “bargain of the day”.</p>
      <p>The box of biscuits are marked down from £4 in the sale - to £3.99.</p>
      <p>While this deal may be a little disappointing, Aldi’s other Black Friday deals include a Balco 3D Printer for £149.99, an Adventuridge 4 man Air Tent for £59.99 and a Cannon All in One Printer for £19.99.</p>
      <p>Aldi operates stores across Birmingham and throughout the Midlands - with plenty more still to be built, the supermarket giant adds.</p>
