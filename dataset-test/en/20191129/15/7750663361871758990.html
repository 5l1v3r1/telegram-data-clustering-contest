      <p>The 22-year-old joined the Toffees from Watford during July 2018 in a deal understood to be worth around £40million.</p>
      <p>Richarlison has scored five goals for Everton this season, as the Goodison Park club fight to climb the Premier League table, with the position of manager Marco Silva under scrutiny.</p>

      <p>Brands said on Everton TV: "We have to look positive ahead, and I try to do that always.</p>
      <p>"One of the positive things during a week like this which happened is we are now busy with the last details of extending the contract with one of our key players Richarlison until 2024.</p>
      <p>"That is something positive, especially for the long-term of course."</p>
      <p>A 2-0 home defeat by struggling Norwich put further pressure on Silva, with some fans calling for him to be dismissed.</p>

      <p>Brands, though, maintains everyone at the club must put on a united front.</p>
      <p>"As a board, we have got to support that. Of course, we know in sport, as always, you have to perform – that's me, the manager, the players, for everyone," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's also important, especially in this club, after a couple of years of instability, to stick together in this situation.</p>
      <p>"I think it is important that everyone has the feeling that we can turn this around to better results.</p>

      <p>"Most people know that I always go to the dressing room after the game, to see how the atmosphere is.</p>
      <p>"Of course, everyone was disappointed last Saturday, but you saw also really in the eyes of the players the fire that they want to resolve this, to turn this around – together with the whole staff.</p>
      <p>"That's important coming up towards the next couple of games. They will be tough games, but games where we can improve."</p>
