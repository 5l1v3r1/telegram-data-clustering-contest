      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:13:42+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/sponsored/" target="_blank">Sponsored</a></address>
      <p>Whether you’re new to laptop gaming or a life-long veteran, you can save up to £270 this Black Friday with the best laptop deal of the year. The brand’s broad range offer the perfect device to kick-start your gaming journey, whether you’re looking for your first device or your latest upgrade. </p>
      <p>MSI’s broad lineup of gaming laptops is perhaps best summarised by the GF, GL and GP series, all of which are discounted this Black Friday. Each encapsulates MSI’s approach to great design and power, all at three different price points for every type of player. </p>
      <p>With the latest Nvidia graphics capabilities, sleek design, efficient battery life and ergonomic aesthetics, these laptops offer unforgettable on-the-go gaming experiences from starter-friendly prices.</p>
      <h3>GF63 – £799 </h3>

      <p>With MSI’s GF series, players no longer have to make an unnecessary compromise between value and looks. The GF63 has both – so much so that it was the winner of an IF award – featuring a sleek black body design and an Intel 9 gen processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 MaxQ under the hood.  This is more than enough power for smooth gaming on the go, whether you’re playing the latest blockbusters or your favourite indie games. Add in a battery life of 7+ hours and more efficient design, and the GF63 is fine-tuned to be quieter and cooler under intense load – up to 10% over the latest competitors.

      <p>The GL65 is newly launched mid-range gaming laptop in MSI’s lineup. With NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1660Ti graphics and Intel core i7-9750H processor, this beautifully designed laptop is fully capable of top-tier gaming. It features a 15.6 inch full HD display with thin bezels, meaning you get a much larger screen while still being packaged in a more portable small case. Then consider the included Giant Speakers, which offer higher clarity sound and 30% enhanced audio detail, and there’s no question that you’ll be fully immersed in the game. </p>

      <p>For one of the best portable gaming experiences available, MSI’s GP65 is the ideal choice. Featuring Nvidia’s cutting edge new GeForce RTX 2060 and a 9th Gen Intel Core i7 processor with six cores, this laptop is capable of video editing, multitasking, and playing any game without any hassle. The full HD IPS display has a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz, resulting in incredibly smooth and responsive gaming, without any lag, making it suitable for both casual and professional play. Gaming is also made far more responsive thanks to an internal 256GB SSD – load times are therefore drastically reduced. Of course, RGB lighting on the laptop’s keyboard also comes as part of the package for full flashy flair.</p>
