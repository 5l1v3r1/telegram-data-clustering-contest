      <p>A single dad adopted an adorable <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">baby</a> with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/downs-syndrome">Down's Syndrome</a> after she was rejected by over 20 families.</p>
      <p>Doting father Luca Trapanese said he felt little Alba was his daughter 'straight away' when he first held her when she was only 13 days old.</p>
      <p>But Alba didn't have the easiest start to life, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/single-dad-adopts-baby-down-20985737">according to The Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>Her own mother abandoned her because she was diagnosed with the condition before facing a cycle of rejection.</p>
      <p>It all changed in July 2017 when Luca was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/adoption">granted custody</a> and the pair embarked on their life together as father and daughter.</p>
      <p>Luca, from Naples in Italy, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC</a>  :“Since I was 14 years old, I have volunteered and worked with the disabled so I felt I had the right knowledge and experience to do it.”</p>

      <p>“When I first held her in my arms, I was overcome with joy. I felt she was my daughter straight away.</p>
      <p>"It was the first time I held a newborn baby. Before that moment, I have always been scared. But, when I first held Alba, I knew I was ready to be her dad.”</p>
      <p>Luca recently started documenting his journey raising his daughter and has already amassed more than 130,000 followers on Instagram .</p>
      <p>He says the child has "revolutionised his life and everything revolves around her" and added: "She brought me happiness and a sense of fulfilment. I am proud to be her dad."</p>
      <p>During the radio interview he also explained that his case is special because it “destroys stereotypes about fatherhood, religion and family.”</p>
