      <p>Defendant Ian Lee Pryor (51) stared at his family and supporters in the public gallery, some of whom broke down in tears, and mouthed the word 'how' multiple times as the foreman of the jury of six men and five women delivered their majority verdict after more than eight hours of deliberations spanning two days.</p>
      <p>One member of the public ran to hug Pryor as he was led away before shouting obscenities at his co-defendant Anthony John Quant (51), who is already serving a 12-year jail term for multiple counts of rape, indecent assault and sodomy.</p>
