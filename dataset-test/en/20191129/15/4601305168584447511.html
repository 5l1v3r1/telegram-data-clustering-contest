      <p>Universal's attempts to make their shared Dark Universe full of updated iterations of classic movie monsters, has so far, been kind of a failure. Sure The Mummy was flashy and filled with big names. but its script was lacking in the substance that made the original film so great. And while it wasn't a Dark Universe film, Universal's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolfman_(2010_film)">The Wolfman</a> suffered from the same problem.  From the looks of things, Universal's intellectual property losing streak may well change with The Invisible Man.</p>
      <p>If the trailer is anything to go by,iIt looks to be full of suspense and possesses a plot that might put bums in seats once the reviews come in. That Elisabeth Moss, versatile actor that she is, has been cast as the lead gives me hope that maybe this will be a Universal monster movie worth the price of admission.</p>
