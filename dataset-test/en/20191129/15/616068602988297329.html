      <p>Donations may be down at the Upper Room Mission, but people are still getting the help they need.</p>
      <p>Naomi Rouck, mission general manager, said donations are down in general, including the annual Blessing in a Backpack program.</p>
      <p>“They are coming in slowly,” she said. “Our goal is to have 280. There are a lot of other places that are looking for things but we are reaching out far and wide to get the backpacks in.”</p>
      <p>The backpack program encourages people to fill a backpack with basic items like socks, small notepads, pens, gloves, toques or other small items.</p>
      <p>They will then be handed out at the mission's Christmas party Dec. 23.</p>
      <p>“I have faith our goals will be met and we will be able to hand them out to those who need them,” said Rouck.</p>
      <p>For many of the recipients, it could be the only gift they get all year.</p>
      <p>But the backpack program is not the only area where donations are lagging.</p>
      <p>Rouck said the mission has a regular group of donors, but overall things are slower.</p>
      <p>“I have actually found donations are really down this year. I know everybody is struggling this time of year to look after their own needs and that is totally understandable,” she said. “But I know there are single families out there and seniors and people on the street who could use that little bit of extra help, it kind of breaks my heart.”</p>
      <p>But that does not mean people are going without.</p>
      <p>“I try to figure out ways to make things a little easier for everybody,” she said, adding it can be a challenge at times.</p>
      <p>“We basically rely on cash donations to make the mission run and they are way, way down this year so it has been quite the struggle for us.”</p>
      <p>But Rouck has faith that things will get better.</p>
      <p>“I really know things will turn around for the mission and we will be in a better situation,” she said. “People always come by with what we need. I have a lot of faith in that.”</p>
      <p>Backpacks and other donations can be dropped off at the mission, 3403 27 Ave., during regular business hours.</p>
