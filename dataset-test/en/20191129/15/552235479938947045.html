      <p>Here come Irvine's Min-isters in Black - planet earth defenders.</p>
      <p>Reverend Neil Urquhart and Father Wullie Boyd - aka the Shoes Brothers - are back with yet another festive video and song, this time with a Green theme.</p>
      <p>The Ecumenical Eco Warriors have 'Come to Save Our Planet' - the title of their latest film-making mission from God.</p>
      <p>And they've plenty of back-up in the shape of  Irvine Clean-up Crew, Coastwatch, Irvine Beat and pupils from Loudoun Montgomery, St Mark’s, and Castlepark primary schools who all play a part in the video.</p>
      <p>The accompanying song of the same name - a fusion of hip-hop and house music - sees the MIB duo passionately rap and sing about the importance of looking after our natural world.</p>
      <p>Rev Urquhart said: "Rising tides, floods, programmes like Blue Planet, and the protestations of our young people heighten awareness of the need to better care for Mother Earth.</p>
      <p>"We want to remind folk that Jesus is passionate about Green issues, come to save our planet as well as us humans, indeed his first bed was a recycled animal feeder!</p>
      <p>Fr Boyd added: “We love getting into the neighbourhood to celebrate community and catch people doing good.  Once again people were so supportive and game for a laugh.</p>
      <p>"Filming involved a few firsts, like singing in a wind turbine, dancing in a car knackers’ yard and break-dancing, though I almost needed a ‘hip-hoperation’ after it!”</p>
      <p>The song was premiered earlier today on Irvine Beat FM's lunchtime show during an interview with the Shoes Brothers. It is now available for free download on Spotify, Apple Music &amp; Google Play, under ‘The Shoes Brothers’.</p>
      <p>The radio station plans to play the catchy number four times a day.</p>
      <p>The film will be launched online on Wednesday, December 5 on the Fullonart YouTube Channel and 'The Shoes Brothers Dance’ Facebook page.</p>
