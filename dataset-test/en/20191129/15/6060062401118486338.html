          <b>Hiring a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-choose-the-right-financial-planner-for-you">financial adviser</a> can seem intimidating, but going without one comes with plenty of risk as well. If you don't have someone managing your money and you don't know how to manage it yourself, it's unlikely you'll reach long-term financial goals like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-retire-early-steps-for-early-retirement">retirement</a>.</b>

          <b>If you have no idea if you're on track for retirement and don't know how to find out, a financial adviser could help gauge your progress and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-financial-plan-roadmap-to-your-financial-goals">craft a plan</a> that will help you stay on track.</b>

          <b>Financial advisers can also help you figure out the most tax-efficient strategies to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-in-a-401k-for-retirement">invest for retirement</a>. This is especially true if you're a high-earner who is in one of the top tax brackets.</b>

      <p>Financial advisers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-hire-fee-only-financial-advisor-2019-6">may have gotten a bad rap</a> over the years, but there are plenty of ways paying for professional help can pay off. Not only can having an adviser help you figure out your goals and how to reach them, but they can help <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-planner-advice-investors-do-less-with-money-2019-6">talk you off the ledge</a> when you're on the verge of making a poor financial decision.</p>
      <p>Don't have a financial adviser yet? You may not really need one, but <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/people-who-definitely-need-to-see-a-financial-planner-2019-8">you might also be someone who desperately does</a> — even if you don't know it yet. If you can't decide whether to hire a financial adviser but keep thinking you might need to, here are some signs you should:</p>
      <h3>1. You're a high earner in a top tax bracket</h3>
      <p>Financial adviser Henry Hoang of <a href="https://brightwealthadvisors.com/">Bright Wealth advisers</a> says that, if you are consistently maxing out your retirement savings but still finding yourself in a top tax bracket, a financial adviser could be worth their weight in gold.</p>
      <p>"This is a sign that it will be worthwhile to explore strategies such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/backdoor-roth-ira-income-limits-high-earners-2017-8">backdoor Roth</a> or Mega backdoor Roth strategies," he says.</p>
      <p>High earners are clients who typically have the capacity to take advantage of savings strategies that result in lower taxes paid before or during retirement. But when high earners don't have a financial adviser in their corner, there's a good chance they'll keep paying more in taxes than they should.</p>
      <h3>2. You know you need to take action but keep putting it off</h3>
      <p>Financial adviser Daniel Kopp of <a href="https://wisestewardshipfp.com/">Wise Stewardship Financial Planning</a> says that analysis paralysis is a real problem in most people's finances. This problem takes shape any time you're unable to move forward with decisions like investing, analyzing your student loans, or determining whether you have the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-should-have-disability-insurance-earning-income">right insurance coverage</a>.</p>
      <p>"Analysis paralysis can occur with too many investment decisions, such as making investment decisions or rebalancing portfolios after market corrections or long runs," he says. "This inaction can easily lead to losses in a portfolio or missed chances at larger profits."</p>
      <p>A financial adviser can provide "a rational, yet human perspective" to help you get out of your own way and the behavioral biases we all have. Without one, however, you may be stuck mulling over your next steps for so long that you fail to take action at all.</p>

      <h3>3. You're not on the same page with your spouse when it comes to your finances</h3>
      <p>Hoang says that you may also need a financial adviser if your finances are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-youre-on-the-same-page-as-partner-about-money-2019-8">creating constant tension</a> in your household, and especially if you and your spouse have drastically different ideas about money.</p>
      <p>"Working with a financial planner who can help you two speak openly in a productive manner can help you gain clarity on each of your top values and shared values," he says. "This can help couples work better as a team."</p>
      <p>Without an unbiased third party to help couples work their money issues out, on the other hand, they're often stuck arguing over the same issues for their entire lives.</p>
      <h3>4. You owe back taxes and can't figure out why</h3>
      <p>Financial adviser Sean Mullaney of <a href="https://www.mullaneyfinancial.com/">Mullaney Financial</a> says that hiring a tax-focused financial planner is crucial if you receive a notice from the IRS or a state agency that you owe back taxes.</p>
      <p>In addition to helping you create a long-term financial plan, a good financial planner can help you figure out the underlying issue and meet the deadline for responding to the notice.</p>
      <p>"If the IRS is correct and something went wrong in your tax planning and tax return filing, a good financial planner can get you back on track so that you avoid repeating the mistake in the future," says Mullaney. "If the IRS is wrong, a good financial planner can help you file an appropriate response to obtain a favorable resolution with the IRS."</p>
      <h3>5. You don't know if you're on track for retirement</h3>
      <p>Financial adviser <a href="https://www.brandonrenfro.com/virtual-financial-advisor/">Brandon Renfro</a> says that, if you don't know if you're on track for retirement, you definitely need to have a general idea. And if you can't figure out where to start your journey, hiring a financial planner can help.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/first-step-early-retirement-planning-take-inventory">Retirement is a long-term goal</a> that requires long-term planning, and you won't generally reach your retirement number by accident unless you're investing regularly already and really, really lucky.</p>
      <p>"There are a lot of inherent uncertainties in that, but you still need a well-constructed plan to aim for," says Renfro. "A financial planner can help you define your target and get you in the best path to achieving it."</p>
      <h3>6. You don't have the time (or the desire) to learn about personal finance</h3>
      <p>If your eyes gloss over every time you read about personal finance, you probably need a financial adviser, adds Renfro. The same is true if you're so busy in your personal or professional life that you just can't dedicate the time required to manage your finances and build toward long-term financial goals without outside help.</p>
      <p>"A lot of personal finance isn't terribly difficult, but you still need to read to learn it," says Renfro.</p>
      <p>If you don't have the will or the time, a financial adviser can provide a useful service you desperately need.</p>
