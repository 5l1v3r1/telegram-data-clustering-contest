      <p>A statement issued in Abuja by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said President Buhari disclosed this while addressing the 5th Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) Summit at the Sipopo International Conference Hall, Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said the viability of extending the gas pipeline to North Africa was also under consideration.</p>
      <p>While describing the theme of the Summit, Natural Gas – Energy for Sustainable Development as most appropriate, President Buhari noted that the one-day meeting was “taking place at a critical juncture as global energy supply is transitioning from hydrocarbons to renewables.”</p>
      <p>According to him, the Paris Accord of 2015 signalled the first major global commitment to a deliberate effort on this inevitable transition.</p>

      <p>He said: “Nigeria is proud to be one of the first signatories to the historic Agreement.”</p>
      <p>While explaining why Nigeria and GECF members are focusing on gas development, the Nigerian leader said:</p>
      <p>“We are mindful of the energy deficit in the developing world, especially here in Africa where we have nearly 600 million people without access to modern energy. As responsible leaders, it is our duty to preserve the environment not only for the present but for future generations.</p>
      <p>“We can achieve this balance between our energy deficit and environmental preservation needs by developing and deploying new technologies. Although classified as fossil fuel, natural gas is a viable solution to both our energy and environmental challenges. (NAN)</p>
