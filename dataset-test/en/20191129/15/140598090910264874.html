      <p>You don’t have to splash the cash to stay in a hotel in Seville – you’ll find plenty of friendly, stylish options for under £50 a night. These are usually small, family-owned establishments, with original décor showing taste and charm, run with great care and attention by family members who offer excellent, helpful service. All are centrally located in historic buildings with lots of period detail, and their economic price tag doesn’t mean that the breakfast is scarce either. Here's our pick of the best budget hotels in Seville.</p>

      <p>8 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>This is one of Seville’s smaller and more compact hotels, with only 11 rooms in a 19th-century house. From the elegant pot plants and red carpet outside to welcome guests, it is stylish throughout: the main patio nails the contemporary Andalucian look by matching colourful Triana wall tiles with sleek blue and white cubist furniture; a world map marking Seville reminds weary travellers where they are. It sits on the corner of two narrow streets just north of the cathedral, close to the magnificent Arabic door, the Puerta del Perdon, which dates from the basilica’s time as a mosque (alminar means minaret). <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/hotel-alminar/">Read expert review</a> From £ 73 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/alminar.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Hotel2Alminar">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This charming boutique hotel pays homage to Seville’s Moorish heritage – carved white stucco arches and painted Moroccan furniture create a romantic oasis in an off-the-beaten-track spot in the authentic Sevillano barrio of Macarena, next door to an important church, La Basilica de la Macarena, with its revered jewel-encrusted virgin statue, as well as the original Arabic fortified city walls. Each room is named after a personality from Moorish-era Seville, from princesses to philosophers and poets; all 15 are decorated in individual colour schemes, but with common elements of carved cedar wood furniture, beautiful mirrors, and colourful ceramic tiles. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/alcoba-del-rey-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 79 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/centuriaalcobarey.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Hotel2Alcoba2del2Rey">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>A simple but excellent-value, family-run budget choice in the heart of Seville’s Old Town, just moments away from La Giralda and the main sights. This makes a great, central base with some of the city’s best tapas bars and restaurants on the doorstep. The rooms are all light with white walls and simple, yellow, grey and white décor, looking out to an internal modern courtyard. There’s no pool, but the owners also run La Casa del Flamenco next door which has nightly flamenco displays in a traditional, Moorish-tiled patio Andaluz and tickets are discounted for guests. There’s also a small but pretty, tiled function room and staff can arrange bike hire and help organise tickets, tours, etc. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/hotel-alcantara/">Read expert review</a> From £ 31 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/alcantara.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Hotel2Alc%C3%A1ntara">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>A small, stylish townhouse hotel with fun, quirky décor mixing exposed brick walls, original tiles and upcycled wooden doors with contemporary furniture and impressive eco-credentials. The feel is boutique-on-a-budget – with panelled doors repurposed as groovy headboards, tables and mirrors, and colourful Ikea floor rugs on the roof terrace. Simple rooms are given a chic touch thanks to pretty print wallpaper, and the breakfast room has a quirky, eclectic sitting area with blue velvet Chesterfield sofa, leather armchairs and a coffee table made of a wooden railway wagon. Most of the 20 rooms feel pleasantly light, thanks to large windows, high ceilings and white walls. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/la-parada-del-marques-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 58 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/la-parada-del-marques.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-La2Parada2del2Marqu%C3%A9s">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>A cleverly balanced blend of exposed brick walls with zingy colours, ethnic prints and repurposed furniture make this family-owned 18th-century conversion, halfway between the cathedral and Plaza San Francisco, a stylish city-centre steal. Unusual period features – striking cobalt-blue glass, neo-mudejar scalloped windows, and cast-iron pillars in the patio, with the maker’s name stamped on them – lend it plenty of character. The interiors are nicely complemented by contemporary touches, such as brightly-coloured woven Indian stools and batik cushions; the overall feel is historic but with a modern vibe. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/casa-de-colon-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 51 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/casa-de-cola3n.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Casa2de2Col%C3%B3n">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This converted palace with a magnificent, soaring patio is tucked away between the cathedral and Santa Cruz. The full-sized outdoor swimming pool, a rarity in Seville, is a life-saver for families on boiling-hot summer afternoons. In the basement hammam you can indulge in massages, reflexology and other relaxing treatments as well as the steam room. But the crowning glory is the massive multi-level roof terrace, a popular hang-out for chic Sevillanos, with lots of hidden corners to sip a glass of sherry or cava, overlooking picturesque tiled roofs and wild abandoned gardens. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/eurostars-sevilla-boutique-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 63 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/eurostars-sevilla-boutique.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Eurostars2Sevilla2Boutique2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>A boutique hotel in a converted 18th-century mansion, delightfully relaxed considering Seville's hottest restaurant and bar scene is on its doorstep. Quirky furniture, period details and great value make this family-owned spot the top choice in the Alameda district. The central Andalusian patio sets the mood – hand-laid oxblood ceramic floor with bijou Arabic-style marble fountain in the centre, and replica Roman amphorae on the wall, as well as original columns found in the basement. In keeping with the classical statues nearby, each room is named after a mythological figure. The décor is traditional yet stylish – rooms have soft pink, olive or grey walls with mostly refurbished antique furniture. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/hotel-sacristia-de-santa-ana/">Read expert review</a> From £ 59 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/sacristia-de-santa-ana.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Hotel2Sacrist%C3%ADa2de2Santa2Ana">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This traditional hotel, owned by a Marquess, is bang opposite the Giralda, boasting the best sunset-watching, cocktail-sipping spot at its lively roof terrace bar. This is also a place for art-lovers – the lobby is like a gallery, with family-owned sculptures, paintings and antiques dating back centuries, from a papal portrait and wooden relief of San Isidoro to a small, exquisitely coloured 16h-century painting of Seville, and an 18th-century silk and mother-of-pearl fan. Divided between four floors, rooms are adorned with period furniture and pictures from the family estates: some are decorated in contemporary style, with bold graphic print fabrics, while others are adorned in stripes, toile de jouy and chintz. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/dona-maria-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 86 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/donamariasevilla.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Do%C3%B1a2Mar%C3%ADa2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This classically elegant hotel dotted with clever repro Roman sculptures is a real find. It's located in a handy position between the hip Alameda district with its boho bar-gallery-shops, and the main Zara-tastic central shopping area. The buzzing rooftop bar and restaurant has fabulous city views. Twenty-six rooms are arranged around two patios – the hotel is made up of adjoining 18th-century casa-palacios (mansions). The smaller, rear patio is open-air and plant-filled, with antique tiles and a fountain, while the larger main one is covered but still feels light, thanks to the grand dimensions of the front three-storey mansion with its marble floors. There's also a decent-sized unheated rectangular hot tub. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/casa-romana-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 69 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/casaromanahotelboutique.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Casa2Romana">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

A roof terrace looks out over the square’s verdant trees to the walls and towers of the Alcazar, a red loggia, ancient tiled rooves, and the cathedral and Giralda. Vinela bar to the left of the hotel has old marble pillars, jazzy floor tiles and colourful furniture, a good setting for decent cocktails and tapas. More formal Restaurant Doña Elvira serves traditional dishes in a pretty, cosy dining room, or outside under the trees. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/seville/hotels/hotel-boutique-elvira-plaza//">Read expert review</a> From £ 60 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/elvira-plaza.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1seville1articles1best0cheap0hotels0seville-Hotel2Boutique2Elvira2Plaza">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
