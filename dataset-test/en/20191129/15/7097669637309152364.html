      <h1>Berlin airport to open in 2020 after nine-year delay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:15:31+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP Relax News</a></address>
      <p>Berlin's new international airport is set to open on October 31, 2020, its operating company said Friday, after an embarrassing nine-year delay owing to structural problems and corruption.</p>
      <p>"The BER will open on 31.10.2020," Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg (FBB) said on Twitter, using the international code for the airport.</p>
      <p>FBB said chief executive Engelbert Luetke Daldrup had informed the airport operator's board of the new date.</p>
      <p>Mismanagement of the project in the Brandenburg region that surrounds Berlin has dented Germany's pride in its engineering prowess and reputation for honesty in business.</p>
      <p>The airport was planned in the 1990s and construction began in 2006.</p>
      <p>It was originally to open in 2011 but the date has been repeatedly pushed back over a series of issues, including fire safety.</p>
      <p>In 2016, a former manager was jailed for accepting a bribe.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the airport's initial budget of 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion) has more than tripled as the delay dragged on.</p>
      <p>Brandenburg regional chief Dietmar Woidke hailed Friday's announcement, saying "this time it's going to work."</p>
      <p>The airport is intended to eventually replace Berlin's two existing airports -- Schoenefeld and Tegel.</p>
      <p>But, in a referendum in 2017, Berliners voted to keep Tegel, arguing that with the growing number of arrivals the new airport may already be too small when it opens.</p>
