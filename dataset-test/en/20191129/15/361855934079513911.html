      <h4>Aries</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by holding the door open and giving them small compliments, they’re not going to pick up on your signals. They’re simply going to think you’re a nice, generous person who treats everyone that way.</p>
      <h4>Taurus</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by making sarcastic comments and teasing them about every little thing, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you hate them.</p>
      <h4>Gemini</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by purposely giving other people more attention and trying to make them jealous, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you’re interested in someone else and they don’t stand a chance.</p>
      <h4>Cancer</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by staring at them from across the room and hoping they’ll make the first move, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to get self-conscious and assume there’s something stuck in their teeth or there’s something wrong with their outfit.</p>
      <h4>Leo</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by touching them and making sexual comments, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you’re a player who speaks to everyone like that.</p>
      <h4>Virgo</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by texting them innocent things, like how they’ve been doing and how work has been, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you only value them as a friend.</p>
      <h4>Libra</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by playing with your hair and laughing at everything they say, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you’re nervous around everyone.</p>
      <h4>Scorpio</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by negging them and making them feel inferior, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you’re a bully who can’t be trusted.</p>
      <h4>Sagittarius</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by whining about how you’re single and how badly you want a relationship, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you simply need someone to vent to.</p>
      <h4>Capricorn</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by playing hard to get and waiting hours to respond to their texts, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you’re trying to blow them off and hint you’re not interested.</p>
      <h4>Aquarius</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by flashing around your money in order to impress them, they’re not going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you’re a snob.</p>
      <h4>Pisces</h4>
      <p>If you’re flirting by liking all of their Instagram posts and watching all their stories, they aren’t going to pick up on your signals. They’re going to assume you’re casually tapping the heart button so they’ll do the same for you.</p>
