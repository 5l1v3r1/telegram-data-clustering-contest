      <h1>First Red Dead Redemption 2 mods add a gravity gun, zombies, free roam, disarm NPCs &amp; more</h1>

      <p>The first mods for Red Dead Redemption 2 are finally appearing online. Most of them are in an experimental stage, however, we believe that some of you may be interested in them. Therefore, today we are presenting you the best mods you can currently find for Rockstar’s latest open-world title.</p>
      <p>The first one we have for you is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/64">gopro_2027’s Playground mod</a>. This is a simplistic and messy mod menu that brings a predator missile, zombies and a gravity gun. Do note, though, that this gravity gun is in a WIP. In order to use it, you’ll have to pick up an object by simply aiming at it. You can then deselect object by shooting a bullet. If you have gravity gun enabled and do this while aiming, it will shoot the object.</p>
      <p>The second mod we’re presenting is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/90">Disarm Any Ped mod</a>. As its title suggests, you can disarm any pedestrian you encounter by simply aiming at them. Thus, you can remove all weapons from a pedestrian (something that will be useful in close combat). Furthermore, there is another mod that allows <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/99">Arthur to use handcuffs</a>.</p>
      <p>Another cool but simple mod is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/79">Simple Fight Club mod</a>. This mod creates a Simple trainer to let you create your own fight club, This trainer will have a few options to help you along, but the main functionality of this mod is to allow you to fight against any human AI in Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
      <p>Lastly, you can also download the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/41">Longer Days mod</a> and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/92">1 shot 1 kill mod</a>. Longer Days allows you to modify how long an in-game day lasts for, whereas 1 shot 1 kill allows players to kill everything with 1 shot. There is also a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/74">Riot mod</a> that activates a Riot Mode for the NPCs, as well as a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/60">free roaming mod</a> that enables you to freely move the camera.</p>
      <p>Have fun!</p>
