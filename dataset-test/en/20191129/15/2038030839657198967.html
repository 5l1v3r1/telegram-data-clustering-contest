      <p>Cape Town - Scarlett Johansson has spoken candidly about her marriage to Ryan Reynolds.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/scarlett-johansson-oscars-issue-cover-story"><b>Vanity Fair</b></a>, the <i>Avengers</i> actress opened up about her first marriage to Ryan and the lessons she learnt from the experience.</p>
      <p>"The first time I got married I was 23 years old," she said.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticised it, I think, in a way."</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old was married to the Canadian actor from 2008 to 2011, after they began dating in 2007, <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a30013558/scarlett-johansson-ryan-reynolds-marriage/"><b>ELLE</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"It’s a different part of my life now," she said of that time period.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I’m in a place in my life . . .  I’m able to make more active choices. I’m more present, I think, than I’ve been before."</p>
      <p>In 2014 Scarlett found love again with French journalist Romain Dauriac but the pair divorced in 2017 and share a five-year-old daughter named Rose Dorothy, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a30032278/scarlett-johansson-romanticised-marriage-ryan-reynolds/"><b>Cosmopolitan</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/scarlett-johansson-engaged-to-snl-screenwriter-colin-jost-20190520"><b>The actress recently announced her engagement</b></a> to <i>Saturday Night Live</i> actor Colin Jost – even flaunting her new engagement ring on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her thoughts on marriage now, she said: "The idea of building a family, making a family, and having that work, I like that idea."</p>
      <p>"I think that would be wonderful. I’ve always wanted that. I wanted that also in my marriage to my daughter’s father as well. It just wasn’t the right person. But I like that idea."</p>
