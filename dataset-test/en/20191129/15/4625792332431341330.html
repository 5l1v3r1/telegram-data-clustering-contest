      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:16:46+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ellie Bufkin</a></address>
      <p>President Trump responded to a <i>Newsweek</i> article prediction that he would spend Thanksgiving tweeting by responding to them on Twitter.</p>
      <p>While the president spent the holiday feeding U.S. troops in on a secret trip to Afghanistan, <i>Newsweek</i> shared a prediction that Trump would be "tweeting, golfing, and more." Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., responded to the <i>Newsweek</i> slam with several images of his father with troops in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>"Fake news gonna fake!" Don Jr. said in a tweet with a screen capture of <i>Newsweek'</i>s critical headline. The president further responded to the declaration by <i>Newswee</i>k with his own criticism of the magazine. "I thought Newsweek was out of business?" he queried.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-thanksgiving-plans-maralago-1474518">article</a> shared by <i>Newsweek</i> issued a correction on Thursday evening to acknowledge they had been wrong about their prediction of Trump's activities on Thanksgiving. "This story has been substantially updated and edited at 6:17 pm EST to reflect the president's surprise trip to Afghanistan," the website claimed. The headline was also adjusted to include the update to the presidential schedule but did include that he played golf at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida before departing for Afghanistan with first lady Melania Trump.</p>
      <p>The president also shared several Thanksgiving wishes on Twitter, including a tribute to U.S. military service members before revealing that he had traveled to Afghanistan to meet the active troops in person. "This Thanksgiving, we are thankful to all who wear our Nation's uniform, allowing us to celebrate in safety and peace," he said on Thursday morning.</p>
