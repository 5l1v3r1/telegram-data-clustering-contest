      <h2>WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Footage appears to show the moment armed police fired shots at the suspect after hero members of the public seemed to disarm him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:31:23+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/john-patrick-kierans/" target="_blank">John Patrick Kierans</a></address>
      <p>Terrifying footage appeared to capture the moment members of the public held down a suspected knifeman on London Bridge before he was shot by police.</p>
      <p>A series of videos recorded at the scene in central London seem to detail the minutes leading up to the moment the man was fired upon. </p>
      <p>Astonishingly, in one video, it appears as if a number of members of public were holding down the man.</p>
      <p>In the 45-second recording a member of the public even seems to be retreating from the scene with the suspect's knife after he has been disarmed.</p>
      <p>In a second video, police can be seen pulling a man in civilian clothes off the suspect just seconds before shots are heard. </p>
