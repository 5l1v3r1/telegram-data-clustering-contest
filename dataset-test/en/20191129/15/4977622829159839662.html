      <h1>After Being Slammed For Anti-Semitism Under Corbyn’s Leadership, Labour Now Denounced For Anti-Hindu Prejudice </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:24:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>After being slammed by UK’s top Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, for allowing anti-semitism to grow in his party, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has now been condemned by British Hindu leaders for being anti- Hindu, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7728487/British-Hindu-leaders-join-Archbishop-Canterbury-backing-Chief-Rabbi.html">reports</a> <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Rabbi Mirvis had accused Corbyn for allowing a “poison sanctioned from the top” to take root in the Labour party</p>
      <p>Now, the Hindu Council in UK has come out with a statement saying, “Anti-Hindu prejudice had festered under Labour.”</p>
      <p>Muslim Council of Britain had previously also gave its support to the view espoused by Rabbi Mirvis.</p>
      <p>Anil Bhanot, the Hindu Council's director for interfaith relations, said: 'It is a sad state of affairs that a major political party in our country which used to be a progressive socialist voice has veered towards what is almost a fascist ideology.'</p>
      <p>Anil Bhanot wrote a letter to the Chief Rabbi supporting his intervention, saying “that Labour has increasingly become anti-Semitic and anti-Hindu.”</p>
      <p>Labour Party under the leadership of Jermy Corbyn had unanimously passed the Kashmir Resolution in the wake of the abrogation of <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/insta/its-ill-conceived-partisan-british-indian-orgs-criticise-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-for-kashmir-resolution">Article 370 in J&amp;K</a>. The 25 September motion on Kashmir seeks international observers to "enter" the region and demand the right of self-determination for its people, drawing criticism from the Indian diaspora.</p>
      <p>Immediately 100 British Indian organisations had taken affront to the Labour Party’s 25 September emergency motion on Kashmir, writing to its leader Jeremy Corbyn and calling it "ill-conceived and partisan."</p>
