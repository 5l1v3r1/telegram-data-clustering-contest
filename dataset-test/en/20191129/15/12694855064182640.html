        <b>If you’ve been eyeing up the Huawei P30 Lite, stop what you’re doing because Fonehouse is giving you a 30GB EE contract that bags you not only the Huawei P30 Lite for £31 a month, but also a PlayStation 4 Fifa 20 bundle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Already excellent value for money with no upfront costs, you can enjoy getting your hands on the fantastic Huawei P30 Lite for just £31 a month, including 30GB of data, as well as unlimited minutes and texts. As is the case with all EE tariffs out there, you’ll also get plenty of extra perks bundled in.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, though, they can’t overshadow the massive freebie you’ll get when taking up this contract with Fonehouse. This Black Friday they’re giving customers a PS4 free, which includes your very own copy of the latest Fifa 20 game. All for £31 a month, you’re scoring big this Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Achieving an 8 out of 10 rating from Trusted Reviews, the Huawei P30 Lite is one of the best in its mid-range category, looking as luxurious as some of the more premium priced handsets but at a fraction of the price.</p>
      <p>Offering a sleek glass and metal design, the curved back makes this a very interesting smartphone to look at, available in Peacock Blue and Pearl White, though it’s difficult to nail down just one hue for these inky, almost iridescent designs. With a 6.1-inch infinity display to boot, the subtle notch housing the Huawei P30 Lite’s 32MP selfie camera may make it a winner on some individual’s eyes who were critics of the much larger notch making home on iPhone’s recent entourage of smartphones.</p>
      <p>The Huawei P30 Lite’s rear-camera package does take a hit against the fully-fledged P30 variant, the noticeable differences are only there in low lighting. With a triple threat of sensors, the rear includes a 48MP main sensor, 13MP ultra wide and 2MP depth camera.</p>
      <p>We also felt the Huawei P30 Lite’s performance was worthy of note, as well as its 128GB of storage, concluding in our verdict: “If you want class and some high-end surface thrills at a sensible price, the Huawei P30 Lite is one of the best phones you can buy.”</p>
      <p>Throw into the mix the PS4 Fifa 20 bundle, the game of which our reviewer, Max Parker, deemed “a gorgeous and fun-to-play football game that’s as addictive as ever,” this is a great value contract deal that isn’t worth missing out on if you’re in the market for a great mid-range smartphone that won’t break the bank.</p>
      <p>Coming to just £31 a month with 30GB of data and all EE’s usual fantastic streaming perks, be quick to snap up this bundle deal before this deal sells out.</p>
