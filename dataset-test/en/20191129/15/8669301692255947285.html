      <p>If everything works out, East Bengal in its centenary year celebrations will play an exhibition match with Premier League giants Manchester United at the Salt Lake Stadium next year.</p>
      <p>A four-member delegation from Manchester United, led by Director of Football Allan Dawson, met the red-and-gold club officials and West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas on Friday.</p>
      <p>They also visited the Salt Lake Stadium and expressed satisfaction at the facilities, East Bengal executive committee member Debabrata Sarkar said.</p>
      <p>“This was a preliminary inspection and they will submit a report within 10 days based on which we will go forward. Then we will work out the financial logistics,” Sarkar said.</p>
      <p>It is learnt that the appearance fee for the Red Devils is a whopping Rs 24 crore, plus other extra expenses which will make it a Rs 30-crore affair.</p>
      <p>If it works out, this match will be a part of the centenary celebrations of East Bengal and United’s pre-season Asia tour in July 2020.</p>
      <p>East Bengal began their centenary celebrations with aplomb on July 31 with a march from Kolkata’s Kumartuli area to the club ground at Maidan. A galaxy of stars, including World Cup-winning cricket captain Kapil Dev, were felicitated.</p>
