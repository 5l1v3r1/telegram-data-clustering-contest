      </p>
      <p>Founder of Maximum Media, Niall McGarry has stepped down from his executive role within the Irish branch of the company.</p>
      <p>The decision is due to a controversy surrounding the alleged inflating of false listenership figures related to sponsored content some two years ago.</p>

      <p>In a statement, Maximum Media said:</p>
      <p>"Effective immediately, Justin Cullen will take up the newly created role of Executive Chairman, taking greater oversight of business strategy, structure and operations.</p>
      <p>"As part of this management change Niall McGarry will be stepping down from all executive responsibilities in the Irish business.</p>
      <p>"Niall remains a shareholder and will be heavily involved our UK operation.</p>
      <p>"Day-to-day executive management of Maximum Media will be the responsibility of Chief Commercial Officer, Gillian Fitzpatrick, Chief Marketing Officer, Paul Dunkin, and Chief Financial Officer, Ronan Doolin.</p>
      <p>"These three executives will report directly into the Executive Chairman.</p>
      <p>"We are confident that with this new leadership structure will deliver the solidity and market confidence required to ensure the business can operate effectively and continue to innovate and grow.</p>
