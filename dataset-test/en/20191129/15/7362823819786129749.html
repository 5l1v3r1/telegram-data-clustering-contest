      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ricky-gervais-says-golden-globes-jokes-will-have-to-be-run-by-a-lawyer-before-air-report">Ricky Gervais</a> is set to host the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/golden-globes">Golden Globes</a> for the fifth time in January and the first promotional videos have just been released.</p>
      <p>Airing during <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">NBC</a>’s coverage of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nutcracker-balloon-pummels-marcher-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-marcher">Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> on Thursday, the two short promotional videos show off Gervais in a black tuxedo as he speaks to the camera about hosting the show once again.</p>

      <p>Looking dapper in one video, an off-screen voice tells Gervais to “Just say the lines and pour yourself a drink.”</p>
      <p>Just as Gervais was about to pour himself a little bit of the bubbly, the comedian looked to the camera and stoically stated, “Hi, I’m Ricky Gervais and I’m hosting the Golden Globes" — before popping the cork and letting the drink spray all over the set.</p>
      <p>“Watch out for the camera!” the off-screen voice lamented.</p>

      <p>In the other video, Gervais takes a more laid-back stance, but still takes the time to poke fun at hosting the awards show.</p>
      <p>“Happy holidays, America. I’m Ricky Gervais and I’m hosting the Golden Globe awards, so there’s your early gift,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Is it just what you wanted?” Gervais asked with a sly chuckle.</p>
      <p>“No, it’s not, is it?” Gervais asked again as he burst into laughter.</p>
