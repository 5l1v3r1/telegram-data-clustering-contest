      <p>Just in time for the holidays, Jeffree Star Cosmetics is having two of its biggest sales of the year.</p>
      <p>Between <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cyber-monday-deals">Cyber Monday</a>, the makeup brand will be discounting nearly every product on its website. Its beloved Velour Liquid Lipsticks will retail for less than $11, while its favored eye-shadow palettes will be discounted between 25% and 30% off.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at what to expect from the brand’s sales this weekend.</p>
      <h3>The Black Friday sale from Jeffree Star Cosmetics includes discounts up to 40% off</h3>

      <p>In honor of Black Friday, the brand is pricing most of them at 40% off, with each lipstick costing $10.50 (originally $18).</p>
