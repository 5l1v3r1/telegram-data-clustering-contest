      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - Tourism officials say Hawaii is on track to have more than 10 million visitors in one year for the first time in the state’s history.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/">The Honolulu Star-Advertiser</a> reported Thursday that Hawaii Tourism Authority data shows there have been nearly 8.7 million visitors through October.</p>
      <p>The figure is a 5.5% increase over the 8.2 million arrivals through the same period last year, when the state’s annual count was 9.9 million visitors.</p>
      <p>The authority says the 800,448 tourists who visited Hawaii in October was an increase of nearly 37,000 during the same month last year.</p>
      <p>Officials say the 4.8% increase is part of a decade-long growth pattern.</p>
      <p>Officials say the growth reflects more tourists traveling to the state from the U.S. mainland and countries including Japan and Canada.</p>
