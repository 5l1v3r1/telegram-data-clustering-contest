      <p>Officers received reports of an accident involving multiple vehicles on Lochee Road shortly before 3pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>It is understood the incident, which is reported to have taken place near the junction at Cleghorn Street, evoked a significant police response.</p>
      <p>The road was cleared by 5pm and no one was seriously injured.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness said: “I was driving and I got a notification to say there had been an accident on Lochee Road. It looks like it’s been at the Cleghorn Street junction.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of police officers there at the moment so it looks like maybe it’s quite a bad one. There are about 12 officers on foot and a police van blocking the route.”</p>
