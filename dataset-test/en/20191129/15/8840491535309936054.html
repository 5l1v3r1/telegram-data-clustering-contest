      <p>TG4 are planning a series on Irish hotels and are looking to include the Mulranny Park Hotel as part of the series, writes Tom Gillespie.</p>
      <p>They are looking for people who have a story to tell about the hotel in the past - pre the recent renovations - honeymooning, meeting John Lennon and Yoko Ono, ex-employees, etcetera.</p>
      <p>As it is TG4, they would like to interview people in Irish so anyone who would be able to tell their story in Irish should contact <a href="mailto:sales@mulrannyparkhotel.ie">sales@mulrannyparkhotel.ie</a>.</p>
      <p>Former Beatle John Lennon purchased the 19-acre Dornish Island in Clew Bay in 1967 for £1,700, where he had planned to create a hideaway retreat.</p>
      <p>Shortly before he was shot dead in December 1980 outside his apartment in New York he was seeking to renew planning permission to build a house on Dornish for himself and Yoko Ono.</p>
      <p>After purchasing the island he was granted planning permission by Mayo County Council.</p>
      <p>But after the collapse of his first marriage to Cynthia, he postponed the plans and permission lapsed in 1972.</p>
      <p>John and Yoko visited the island by helicopter and they stayed in the Great Southern Hotel - now the Mulranny Park Hotel.</p>
