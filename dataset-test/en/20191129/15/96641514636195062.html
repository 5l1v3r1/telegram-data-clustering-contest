      <h1>Elektron's Model:Samples groovebox is $100 off for the holidays</h1>
      <h2>The most affordable way to get Elektron's advanced music-making tools just got cheaper.</h2>

      <p>Elektron's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/08/elektron-digitone-keys-groove-box-groovebox-fm-synth/">synths</a>, samplers, drum machines and grooveboxes are known for their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/16/elektron-analog-heat/">top-notch sound</a> and unique sequencing features. Once thing they're not known for, though, is being affordable. The Model:Samples is the big exception to that rule. And it's getting even cheaper for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Most retailers have knocked $100 of the price, bringing the Model:Samples price to just <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ModelSample--elektron-modelsamples-6-track-sample-based-groovebox">$299</a> -- making it perhaps the best bargain in grooveboxes right now.</p>

      <p>The Model:Sample has six monophonic tracks for playing back samples of drums, synths, or anything your heart desires. While its limited on-board sample editing features are a bit of a bummer, its rich and complex sequencer makes sure that things never get boring or robotic. Plus, since it's largely one-knob per function, its actually quite useable for live performances. We really liked the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/05/elektron-model-samples-review-groovebox/">Model:Samples</a> when we reviewed it back in March. We made it clear that there were tradeoffs compared to other Elektron gear. But it kept the most important feature -- the sequencer -- and brought the price within reach of more casual hobbyists.</p>
