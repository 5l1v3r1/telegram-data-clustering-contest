      <p>Melo Mania has hit Portland.</p>
      <p>About 45 minutes before Anthony even played his first home game with the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night, his jersey was already sold out in the team store, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/carmelo-anthony-jerseys-have-already-sold-out-at-the-trail-blazers-team-store-025100656.html">according to reports</a>, and the former Knick later <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/28/carmelo-anthony-comes-up-big-for-trail-blazers-in-home-debut/">received a standing ovation</a> with chants of “Melo” at Moda Center in a 136-119 win over the Thunder.</p>
      <p>Anthony shot 9 of 11 for 19 points in the win and continued to play well after knocking off the rust with his new team.</p>
      <p>“I think people see how genuine this is for me,” Anthony told reporters. “It’s nothing fake. This is real love. I think people can sense when it’s not.”</p>
      <p>Anthony had to wait a while for a team to finally sign him this season, but it appears to be a good fit early on. Through five games, the 35-year-old is averaging 16.6 points and five rebounds. The hurting Trail Blazers have now won back-to-back games.</p>
      <p>“I’ve found that happiness, that joy,” Anthony said. “Guys have welcomed me here with open arms. That makes the process that much easier.”</p>
