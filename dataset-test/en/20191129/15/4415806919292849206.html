      <p>Hungarian police said they have discovered two tunnels used by migrants to enter the country from Serbia.</p>
      <p>The Hungarian National Police Headquarters said that one tunnel was discovered in the southern village of Asotthalom, where they also detained 44 migrants caught using the precarious passageway.</p>
      <p>The other tunnel, in the village of Csikeria, was 71 feet long, but police said no successful migrant crossings took place at the site.</p>

      <p>Police said they discovered both tunnels not long after their construction was completed and filled both of them up again.</p>
      <p>In 2015, at the height of the migration crisis, Hungary built razor-wire fences on its southern borders to stem or divert the flow of people, many from the Middle East and Asia, making their way to Western Europe.</p>
