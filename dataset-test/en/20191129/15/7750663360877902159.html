      <p>The 19-year-old has made a staggering start to the 2019-20 campaign, finding the back of the net on 27 occasions in 19 appearances for his Austrian club in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Haaland has managed 15 goals in 12 league outings, while he has struck eight times in five Champions League appearances this season.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid, Juventus, RB Leipzig and Barcelona are all thought to be considering moves for the Norway international ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>United are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/solskjaer-determined-to-sign-haaland_380082.html">also believed</a> to be firmly in the hunt, though, and according to <i>AS</i>, the presence of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a> as head coach means that the English club are the favourites.</p>
      <p>Haaland played under Solskjaer at Molde, and the teenager is thought to favour a move to the Premier League, where his father <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alf-inge-haaland/"><b>Alf-Inge Haaland</b></a> turned out for Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Manchester City.</p>
      <p>United staff are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-utd-staff-convinced-haaland-will-join-in-january_380680.html">allegedly convinced</a> that the centre-forward will arrive at Carrington at some point during the January transfer window.</p>
