      <p>“(I am) really pleased. Obviously it’s a club that I’ve got a strong affection for,” he told Villa’s website.</p>
      <p>“I joined last year with a remit to try and get us promoted to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“We managed to do it last season and obviously that remit changes now to more of the longer term and making sure that we try and get Aston Villa back to where it’s been in previous years.”</p>

      <p>Villa chief executive Christian Purslow said: “The board is delighted that Dean has signed a new four-year contract which puts him at the heart of the club’s long term rebuilding plans.”</p>
