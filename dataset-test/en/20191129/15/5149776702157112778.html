      <p>Police are continuing to search for missing 27-year-old Newark man Michal Krysztofcyzk.</p>
      <p>It's now more than three weeks since the last confirmed sighting and officers have said they are growing "increasingly concerned" for his welfare.</p>
      <p>He was reported missing from Cross Street, Newark, on November 18.</p>
      <p>The last confirmed sighting of Michal was on November 7 in the Sleaford Road area of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/newark">Newark</a>.</p>
      <p>Specialist <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-police">police</a> underwater search and rescue teams are continuing to search parts of the River Trent on Friday, November 29.</p>
      <p>Searches are also being carried out by police and specialist volunteer teams in woodland areas and officers are continuing to speak to witnesses.</p>
      <p>Michal, who is a Polish national, is white, of slim build and has a bald head.</p>

      <p>He has previously suffered burns which has left him with distinctive scarring to his face, ears, and hands.</p>
      <p>He was last seen wearing the clothing as pictured in the CCTV image.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Ricky Ellis, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-police">Nottinghamshire Police</a>, said: "We have had a number of reported sightings which we have thoroughly looked into but they have not been confirmed sightings.</p>
      <p>"We're continuing our searches for Michal and we're re-appealing to anyone who has seen him or who has any information about his whereabouts - no matter how small - to get in touch with us.</p>
      <p>"We're growing increasingly concerned for Michal's welfare as we know he hasn’t got his mobile phone with him and there hasn't been any activity on his bank account.</p>
      <p>"Michal's family is distraught and really worried about him, as we all are. One can only imagine how difficult it would be to not have any contact with a loved one for this long.</p>
      <p>"We have been in close contact with Michal’s family to support them and ensure they are aware of our activity during what must be a heart-breaking time for them.</p>
      <p>"We'd particularly like to hear from members of the local Polish community in Newark who may have information as Michal was well known."</p>
      <p>Anyone who has seen Michal since November 7 is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police as soon as possible on 101, quoting incident number 350 of 18 November 2019.</p>
