      <h1>Baby Yoda is trending higher than most 2020 Democratic hopefuls</h1>

      <p>Baby Yoda for president?</p>
      <p>The breakout star of “The Mandalorian” is driving nearly twice as many average social media interactions in news stories about it as any 2020 Democratic hopeful, <a href="https://www.axios.com/baby-yoda-2020-democrats-michael-bloomberg-deval-patrick-b3bf5f78-436a-42a5-8904-7c33ac15b85c.html">according to Axios</a>.</p>
      <p>The diminutive, doe-eyed, big-eared creature with an uncanny resemblance to the Jedi Master has taken the internet by storm since being introduced Nov. 12 in the Star Wars spin-off series on Disney+.</p>
      <p>The adorable character’s debut coincided with the entry of two latecomers into the Democratic field, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.</p>
      <p>Both candidates have had a significant number of articles written about them since Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg ranks second among the Democratic pack with 7,650, while Patrick is in fourth with 4,044, according to data from NewsWhip provided to Axios.</p>
      <p>But with Baby Yoda in the mix with the Democrats, Bloomberg ranks 14th and Patrick 16th in terms of average interactions, including likes, comments and shares, per story about them, according to Axios.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the diminutive creature has notched an average interaction rate 10 times higher than theirs, the news outlet said.</p>
      <p>In terms of raw interactions since Nov. 12, Baby Yoda’s 2.28 million trail only the Democratic frontrunners — Joe Biden (8 million), Bernie Sanders (2.9 million) and Elizabeth Warren (2.53 million).</p>
      <p>The rate of interactions is massive, though, considering that Baby Yoda would only rank 10th in terms of the number of articles (1,368) written about it.</p>
      <p>Because the data only captures interactions with news stories, it doesn’t take in the myriad Baby Yoda memes and content native to social media — meaning that its reach is likely far wider.</p>
