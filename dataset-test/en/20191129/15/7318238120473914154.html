      <p>Sunbathers soaking up the rays in the Canary Islands joined forces with emergency workers on November 29 after a rickety boat carrying two dozen migrants landed unexpectedly on a beach in the Spanish archipelago.</p>
      <p>The migrants, among them three children and one pregnant woman, arrived midday on the rocky shores of the Aguila beach in Gran Canaria.</p>
      <p>Seemingly exhausted, cold and some still in a state of shock after weathering the Atlantic, rescue services handed out thermal blankets, food and water. Red Cross officials said the migrants were from northern and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p>Sunseekers also sought to help out, with one cradling a weary woman in her lap as another swimsuit-clad woman fed her water.</p>
      <p>Some 27,594 migrants have arrived in Spain so far this year by mid-November, according to data from the Interior Ministry, a decrease of more than 50% from the same period last year.</p>
      <p>The popular tourist destination of Canary Islands, however, has seen an increase of 22% in arrival this year, with 1,493 migrant arrivals so far registered by mid-November.</p>
