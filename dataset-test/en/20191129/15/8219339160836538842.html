      <p>Microsoft Remote Desktop is a service that allows users to access and use their computer through another device, such as an iPhone or iPad. The iOS app, which had been abandoned for over a year, was updated this week with several new features, including support for recently released Apple devices and also Dark Mode compatibility on iOS 13.</p>
      <p>After pairing the computer with another device using the IP address, users can access the Windows Desktop and the entire file system with support for multi-touch controls and gestures, audio, microphone, and even cameras. It is compatible with any PC running Windows Professional, Enterprise or Server.</p>
      <p>For those who had doubts about the app remaining available, Microsoft has assured users that it will maintain support for Remote Desktop Client on iOS. The 10.0.0 version of the app brings more than ten new features and changes.</p>
