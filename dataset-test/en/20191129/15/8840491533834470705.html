      <p>A MAYO firm was one of the main winners at the prestigious InterTradeIreland Seedcorn Investor Readiness Competition final, held at the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Limerick company Tracworx was named the overall winner of the competition. The company has developed a patient tracking system that uses only the existing Wi-Fi networks in a hospital, allowing them to automate their data collection and to generate reports using real-time data.</p>
      <p>Mayo company Atlantic Photonic Solutions was the other main winner on the night, winning the Best New Start Category award and a cash prize of €50,000.</p>
      <p>APS have developed a harmless fish-friendly light that aims to remove sea lice from farmed salmon.</p>
      <p>Rory Casey, managing director at Atlantic Photonic Solutions, commented: “The Seedcorn process has allowed us to not only become investor ready but hone our presentation skills and condense and refine business opportunities.</p>
      <p>“We’d like to thank the team at InterTradeIreland, the judges and all those that helped with our pitch – it has been a wonderful journey. Seedcorn has already opened so many doors for us, and we look forward to an exciting 12 months ahead.”</p>
      <p>Congratulating the winners, Ken Nelson, MBE, InterTradeIreland chairman, said: “Seedcorn replicates the real-life investment process, providing companies with the opportunity to put their business idea to the test and ensure it is investor-ready. These early stage businesses are vital to the economy, both north and south, and it is important we ensure these high potential start-ups are provided with the support and guidance needed to grow and develop their business propositions.</p>
      <p>“I congratulate Tracworx and Atlantic Photonic Solutions Ltd. on their success, and on behalf of everyone at InterTradeIreland we wish them the very best for the next stage in their journey. I have no doubt both companies will go on to achieve great success.”</p>
