      <h3>Best iPad deals that are live right now</h3>
      <p>Nearly every major Black Friday iPad deal is now live across a number of retailers. Most notably, <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/12/02/apple-10-ipad-deals/">Apple’s 10.2-inch iPad is marked down to as low as <b>$218.50</b></a>. This is easily the best price we’ve tracked all-time as Apple’s latest tablet becomes more affordable than ever before.<a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/12/02/apple-10-ipad-deals/"> 10.2-inch iPad is also <b>$100</b> if you buy a new iPhone</a> at Verizon.</p>

      <p>Other notable deals include <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/12/02/apple-10-ipad-deals/">Apple’s latest iPad Air for <b>$99 off</b></a> at Amazon. This is yet another all-time low price, making an additional $50 drop from some of this year’s deals.</p>
      <p>iPad mini 5 has largely been absent from this year’s deals, <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/12/02/apple-10-ipad-deals/">but you can currently save </a><b><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/12/02/apple-10-ipad-deals/">$40 off</a> </b>at Amazon.</p>
      <p>There are a number of early Black Friday deals currently available, including the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/12/02/apple-10-ipad-deals/">previous-generation 9.7-inch iPad Wi-Fi + Cellular for <b>$429</b></a>. We’re also seeing other previous generation models on sale too, like the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/12/02/apple-10-ipad-deals/">10.5-inch iPad Pro with 512GB of storage for <b>$699</b></a> and more.</p>

      <h3>Best iPad Black Friday deals to come</h3>
      <p>iPad Pro is expected to be discounted by as much as <b>$400 off</b> at <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/07/best-buy-black-friday-ad-preview/">Best Buy</a> with <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/18/best-black-friday-deals-amazon/">Amazon</a> bringing similar pricing when all is said and done. We also know that previous generation 10.5-inch models will be on sale too, with the 512GB version <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/walmart-black-friday-ad-2019/">listed at <b>$599</b> via Walmart</a>.</p>
      <p>iPad mini 5 has mostly been left out of early Black Friday leaks and has mostly gone without a discounted in 2019 from authorized retailers. Rakuten is likely to fill the void when it rolls out a <b>15% off</b> sitewide discount next week. Otherwise, you’re not expected to see a straight cash price drop on Apple’s smallest iPad throughout Black Friday.</p>
