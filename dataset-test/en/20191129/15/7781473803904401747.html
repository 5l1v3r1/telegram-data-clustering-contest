      <h1>MV Agusta Dragster 800 series sold out in India</h1>

      <p>In less than two months since its launch, Motoroyale has sold all units of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/mv-agusta/dragster/800-v1525/">MV Agusta Dragster 800</a> imported into India. Pune-based Motoroyale launched the Dragster series in India in October via the CBU route, bringing in a total of six units. These include two units each of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/mv-agusta/dragster/800-rr-v1526/">MV Agusta Dragster 800 RR</a>, Dragster 800 RR America and Dragster 800 RR Pirelli. On the face of it, six units of a motorcycle getting sold in a span of less than two months might not sound like a significant achievement, but it is, when you consider the specifics. To begin with, the Dragster is the highest selling model for MV Agusta globally and enjoys immense popularity and aspirational value for its design and performance both, so its instant success in India should not come as a surprise.</p>

      <p>The Dragster series is easily among MV Agusta's most exotic and stunning looking model line-up and is regarded as one of the best-looking motorcycles on the planet. The Dragster 800 RR and Dragster 800 RR America both have been priced at Rs 18.73 lakh ex-showroom in India while the more exotic Dragster 800 RR Pirelli retails at Rs 21.50 lakh ex-showroom. Needless to mention, the Pirelli is a special edition co-developed with the famous Italian tyre manufacturer and most of the motorcycle is coated with a special rubber compound that makes it resistant to scratches, ensuring the surface finishes stay pristine. All three versions are powered by the same engine as the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/mv-agusta/brutale-m539/">MV Agusta Brutale</a> 800 RR, which is a 798cc, inline three-cylinder engine putting out 140PS and 87Nm - these are the kind of outputs associated with bigger, litre-class sport nakeds!</p>

      <p>The high performance engine aside, the Dragsters boast a very gorgeous design, making them some of the most gorgeous-looking motorcycles on the planet. And the fact that Motoroyale has sold all six units of a model that commands a very high premium (relatively) and is a niche product, at a time when the sales numbers for most premium motorcycle brands in the country are witnessing a downward trend, is certainly commendable. This goes to show that demand for exotic, high-performance motorcycles certainly exists in the country, irrespective of market trends and should also act as a catalyst for Motoroyale.</p>
