      <p>The incoming chief executive of the Premier League David Pemsel has withdrawn from the role following tabloid reports about his private life.</p>
      <p>Former Guardian chief executive Pemsel was due to take up the position in February, succeeding Richard Scudamore.</p>

      <p>The Premier League said in a statement on Friday: “Following media disclosures earlier this week and discussions with David Pemsel, the Premier League has today accepted David’s resignation and he will no longer be joining as chief executive.</p>
      <p>“Richard Masters will continue as interim chief executive. No further comment will be made at this stage.”</p>
      <p>The Premier League announced last month that Pemsel would be joining from the Guardian.</p>

      <p>Former executive chairman Scudamore was awarded a £5m payout by the league on his exit last year.</p>
      <p>His role was split between an executive and chair positions.</p>
