      <p>He’s back! Vancouver chef Nitzan Cohen is reviving his popular <a href="https://www.facebook.com/menschdelicatessen/">Mensch. Jewish Delicatessen</a> after a long hiatus, with two nights of his signature hot pastrami and more before the year is out.</p>
      <p>Cohen introduced Vancouver to his hand-crafted and hand-sliced hot pastrami piled high on fresh rye bread a few years ago, holding one-off pop-ups and even an extended run a couple of years back. But we haven’t had an official Mensch pop-up <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2018/11/14/mensch-jewish-delicatessen-pop-up-december-2018/">in about a year</a>, so mark your calendars.</p>
      <p>Mensch will return on Saturday, November 30 and Saturday, December 14. This time it will take place where Cohen is currently hanging his chef’s hat: Kafka’s Coffee at the Emily Carr University of Art + Design campus on Great Northern Way.</p>
      <p>In addition to the hot pastrami – which is made as a labour of love with 10 days of brining, eights hours of smoking and four hours of steaming – Mensch will have beet-cured lox with house-made Labneh on a poppy seed bagel. To drink, beer from Brassneck Brewery and pop will be available.</p>
      <p>Cohen adds that there will be more Mensch pop-ups in the new year.</p>
      <h3>Mensch. Jewish Delicatessen Pop up Series</h3>
      <p><b>When</b>: Sat. Nov. 30 and Sat. Dec. 14 from 6 p.m. until they run out<br/><b>Where</b>: Kafka’s Coffee – 577 Great Northern Way, Vancouver</p>
