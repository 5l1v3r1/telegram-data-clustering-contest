      <p>North-east England used to be a loyal Labour heartland but at this election the party is on the defensive, with the Conservatives eyeing up to half a dozen gains.</p>
      <p>This is an area of the country where Brexit could be about to overturn decades of tradition at the ballot box.</p>
      <p>Labour has held Bishop Auckland continuously since 1935.</p>
      <p>Just four MPs have represented the seat during those 84 years: Hugh Dalton, James Boyden, Derek Foster and Helen Goodman.</p>

      <p>But this long period of uninterrupted one-party representation might come to an abrupt end on December 12.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives need a swing of just 0.6% to take the seat – and recent polls suggest they could be on course to win comfortably.</p>
      <p>Other Labour seats at risk in the region include Stockton South, which would change hands on a 0.9% swing, Darlington (3.7%) and Sedgefield, former seat of Tony Blair (7.3%).</p>
      <p>Sedgefield is another constituency that has been Labour since 1935, save for an interlude when the seat was abolished between 1974 and 1983.</p>
      <p>If the Tories do exceptionally well in north-east England, Hartlepool (on a 9.2% swing), Durham North West (9.2%) and Blyth Valley (9.4%) could even turn blue.</p>
      <p>By contrast, there is only one seat in the region that Labour could take from the Conservatives at this election.</p>
      <p>This is Middlesbrough South &amp; Cleveland East, which Labour held from the seat’s creation in 1997 through to 2017, before losing it to the Tories.</p>
      <p>They would win it back on a swing of 1.1%.</p>
      <p>A batch of safe Labour seats in this region will be among the first to declare on election night: Houghton &amp; Sunderland South, Sunderland Central and the three constituencies in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Labour should hold all of them – but it will be worth keeping an eye on the results for evidence of a swing to the Conservatives, and to see how much the Labour majorities may have changed, either up or down.</p>
