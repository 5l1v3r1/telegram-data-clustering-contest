        <b>Manchester City have work to do in the Premier League title race, but Pep Guardiola is not looking too far ahead.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola will not allow his focus to drift towards the bigger picture of the Premier League title race as Manchester City chase victory at Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>The defending champions but find themselves third after 13 matches, already nine points behind leaders Liverpool, who defeated Guardiola’s men at Anfield this month.</p>
      <p>City kick off the latest weekend of Premier League action against Newcastle on Saturday, giving them a chance to leapfrog second-placed Leicester City – albeit possibly only temporarily.</p>
      <p>That will be Guardiola’s aim at St James’ Park, with the former Spaniard insisting he does not like to think about the season as a whole.</p>
      <p>“I’m not thinking about how many games we have to win – I know we cannot lose games,” he told a news conference.</p>
      <p>“I’m not thinking honestly about winning the Premier League right now. I never thought about it, even in the years we won.</p>

      <p>“To win the Premier League, we have to be close to Leicester, first of all, and then to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“The target, when you play games in different competitions every three days, is the next one. You choose the best players possible for this specific game and try to win.”</p>
      <p>City came unstuck at Newcastle last season, having had to settle for a slightly nervy win during the previous campaign.</p>
      <p>Guardiola added: “The last two seasons, we won 1-0 and, last season, we lost 2-1. Newcastle away is always one of the nicest environments and stadiums in England.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, it’s a tough test, but next Tuesday we have Burnley and then the derby against [Manchester] United, so we know the situation we are in.</p>
      <p>“We trained really good today [Friday]. I saw the team were ready. We fly this afternoon and then tomorrow, 12.30, we try to do a good game.”</p>
