      <h2>Taking a morning break from their specialist training seven of the group of nine pups enjoyed a birthday cake made specially for dogs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:20:35+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>A group of guide dog <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dogs">puppies</a> came together to celebrate their first birthday at a special event in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> .</p>
      <p>The puppies are part of the first ever fully- <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charity">funded</a>  guide dog group, thanks to support from players of People's Postcode Lottery.</p>
      <p>Over the last 12 months lottery players have raised £2,209,506 towards the training and care of these life-changing pups, as well as for other key projects at the charity.</p>

      <p>Taking a morning break from their specialist training, seven of the group of nine pups attended the party, where they enjoyed a birthday cake made specially for dogs.</p>
      <p>They also met People's Postcode Lottery staff for some well- deserved cuddles.</p>
      <p>Turning one means the pups will soon enroll at their Guide Dogs training school, where they will receive their formal training before graduating as fully qualified guide dogs.</p>
