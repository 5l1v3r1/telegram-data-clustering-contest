      <p>MOSCOW, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Russia's agriculture safety watchdog said on Friday it removed temporary restrictions on beef supplies to Russia from two plants in Brazil starting from Nov. 29.</p>
      <p>One of the plants authorized to resume sales to Russia is operated by Minerva SA and the other one by JBS , the Russian regulator, Rosselkhoznadzor said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Rosselkhoznadzor had placed temporary restrictions on imports of pork and beef products from Brazil in December 2017 after it said it found ractopamine in some shipments, a feed additive that is permitted in Brazil but banned in Russia.</p>
      <p>Since then, the Russian government has allowed some suppliers to resume sales out of Brazil, though some plants, including a few run by Minerva and JBS, remain restricted.</p>
      <p>Ractopamine allows livestock to grow at a faster rate while consuming less feed. It is banned in countries including Russia and the European Union. (Reporting by Polina Devitt; editing by Ana Mano and Marguerita Choy)</p>
