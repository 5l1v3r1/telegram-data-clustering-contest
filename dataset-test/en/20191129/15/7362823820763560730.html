      <p>Reunited and it feels so good.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlin-fuller-house-final-season-trailer-college-admissions-scandal">“Fuller House”</a> star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/8-things-you-didnt-know-about-candace-cameron-bure">Candace Cameron Bure</a> revealed that she reunited with brother Kirk Cameron in an episode for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/netflix">Netflix</a> series’ fifth and final season.</p>
      <p>“My brother Kirk is in an episode this season, so that was a really fun surprise,” the 43-year-old told <a href="https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/candace-cameron-bure-brother-kirk-reuniting-on-fuller-house/">Closer Weekly</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“It’s a little bit of, like, a ‘90s episode, so <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lisa-loeb-reflects-on-90s-success-with-stay-recording-music-for-children">Lisa Loeb</a> is in it as well as my brother Kirk,” the actress continued. “And that week I was directing as well… it was a dream come true to direct my brother.”</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time the siblings have shared the screen. According to Closer Weekly, Cameron Bure previously appeared on Kirk’s sitcom <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/growing-pains-friendship-prayer">“Growing Pains”</a> for two episodes. The 49-year-old also appeared in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/john-stamos-lori-loughlin-photos-end-fuller-house">“Full House”</a> for one episode. The magazine shared the appearances occurred in the late ‘80s.</p>
      <p>“My brother and I have acted – before when we were younger – together,” said Cameron Bure. “And since then we haven’t done anything, any kind of movie or television show together, until Season 5 of ‘Fuller House.’”</p>
      <p>Cameron Bure also revealed Kirk was eager to work alongside her.</p>
      <p>“He was so game,” she said. “He just walked onto the set as he’d been… like he never stopped doing a sitcom. He was really funny, but he was so supportive and proud of me directing. So he was like, ‘Can, just tell me whatever you want me to do.’ And I’d come in and tell him what I wanted to see and he would just give me everything and was very receptive to whatever direction I had for him… It was fun.”</p>

      <p>“I wanted to give him a hard time,” Cameron Bure joked. “I wanted to somehow fire him on the set and cause drama, but I couldn’t 'cause he was awesome.”</p>
      <p>In November of this year, Bure posted <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/candace-cameron-bure-posts-emotional-instagram-story-about-end-of-fuller-house-in-tears-all-morning">an emotional Instagram post</a> telling her followers she was “in tears all morning” as the cast and crew filmed the finale.</p>
      <p>"This is it,” she said. “We just have a week left with each other. It’s really hard. It’s really, really hard.”</p>
      <p>"There's no worry on our part about the future, and so I just thank you and reassure you to just have tears with us and hug along with us, 'cause that's what we need, more the comfort and the love," she added.</p>
