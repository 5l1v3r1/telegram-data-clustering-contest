      <p>SCOTLAND’S weather and landscape is perfect for cattle and sheep production.</p>
      <p>It’s just one reason Scotch Beef PGI and Scotch Lamb PGI have a reputation as the best in the world.</p>
      <p>Our farmers have an understanding and awareness of the environment and the elements – their livelihoods depend upon careful management of fragile ecosystems that help support their animals.</p>
      <p>Livestock raised in Scotland boasts social and environmental credentials as well as strict animal welfare and quality assurance guarantees.</p>
      <p>Happily, Scotland is one of the most sustainable places in the world to produce red meat.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, we have an abundant, natural fresh water supply here in Scotland to produce top quality beef and lamb while three-quarters of farmland is grassland or rough grazing which is not suitable for growing cereals and vegetables but perfect for livestock grazing.</p>
      <p>In addition, as part of a natural cycle, grass grazed by livestock absorbs carbon from the atmosphere and captures it in the soil, helping to reduce the greenhouse effect.</p>
      <p>Livestock farmers work in harmony with nature. Bruce McConachie, a fourth-generation beef farmer from Grantonon-Spey, says Scottish farming in particular is sustainable and environmentally positive, with animal welfare standards that are second to none.</p>
      <p>“I create habitat corridors by planting hedges and trees on farmland and implement different grassland sowing and cutting regimes, which helps promote and protect natural habitats for wildlife such as curlew, snipe and lapwings.</p>
      <p>"It’s our responsibility to leave this ground in a better condition than we found it and to be constantly trying to improve the habitats, the environment and the soil on the farm.</p>
      <p>"It’s a point of pride knowing that we’re producing a great product and adding to the natural environment.”</p>
      <p>Farming also boosts the livelihoods and future of local communities.</p>
      <p>About 50,000 jobs are supported by the Scottish red meat industry – often in areas with few other work opportunities.</p>

      <h3>Key facts about our cattle</h3>
      <p>• CATTLE GRAZING on rain-fed Scottish pastures help the landscape absorb carbon from the atmosphere, combating global warming.</p>
      <p>• OVER 80% of Scottish farmland is grassland or rough grazing not suitable for growing cereals and vegetables but ideal for beef and lamb production.</p>
      <p>• ABOUT 50,000 jobs are supported by the Scottish red meat industry.</p>
      <p>• THE SCOTCH BEEF PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI or Specially Selected Pork logo, indicates farms that uphold stringent animal welfare standards.</p>
      <p>Scottish consumers understand provenance and embrace the concept of buying locally, for quality as much as reducing food miles.</p>
      <p>When you see the Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI or Specially Selected Pork logo, you’re supporting farms that uphold stringent animal welfare standards.</p>
      <p>Quality assured farms are independently audited and inspected to ensure the very highest welfare standards are met.</p>
      <p>Our farmers wouldn’t have it any other way</p>
