      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:05:12+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Ten exotic <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/animals">animals</a> were killed as a blaze tore apart a popular Safari park with wildlife running free to try and escape the flames.</p>
      <p>Antelope, three giraffes, red river hogs and a springbok all died following the fire which started in a barn overnight.</p>
      <p>It devastated <a href="https://www.sababu-safaris.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzujIzMeP5gIVQrTtCh2mpwV9EAAYASAAEgKy_vD_BwE">African Safari Wildlife Park</a> in Port Clinton, Ohio - but 300 other animals are all accounted for.</p>
      <p>The State Fire Marshall is to visit the park to investigate why fire ripped through the area over the coming days.</p>
      <p>The park opened in 1969 and has been visited by thousands of people every week for 50 years.</p>

      <p>"We are grateful that our staff is safe and no one was injured.</p>
      <p>"But the loss of the wildlife that we care for every day is tragic for our team members who love these animals.Â </p>
      <p>The park is set to remain closed this weekend as staff come to terms with the fire.</p>
