      <h1>Save up to 50% on Bose headphones, speakers, and home audio</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:02:41+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>Even if audiophiles would probably disagree, I'd say you can't go wrong with Bose if you're a regular consumer in need of good sound quality. Amazon must've thought as much when it decided to reduce prices of more than a dozen Bose products such as headphones, soundbars, and smart home speakers. Some of the devices are discounted by more than 50%.</p>
      <p>You can save the most money on the Bose SoundTouch series. It consists of wireless speakers that work with Alexa and connect to your phone via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. If you're looking for an upgrade to your Amazon Echo devices or haven't invested into Google/Nest Home speakers yet, they might be worth a look (or listen). The SoundTouch 300 soundbar is also interesting at $400, which is $300 off the MSRP. If you're looking for personal audio devices, the SoundSport Free Truly Wireless Headphones (<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/12/20/bose-soundsport-free-review-beats-competition-youll-pay/">our review</a>) could be a great-sounding option for the gym – just be aware of its odd design and its relatively short battery life.</p>
