      <h1>Star Wars: Boyega Confesses Affection for Isaac in Hilarious New Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:11:01+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Duane Richards</a></address>
      <p>For Finn and Poe shippers, the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>Rise of Skywalker</i></a> promotional tour has been nothing short of a gift.</p>
      <p>While both actors John Boyega and Oscar Isaac have been incredibly cheeky about the supposed <i>Star Wars</i> romance between their two characters, Boyega has taken it to the next level with a new Instagram post. In the video, captioned in part with "I need to stop watching <i>The Crown</i>," Boyega laments that he and Isaac are not as close as Finn and Poe seem to be. He also hilariously points out (with video evidence) moments in past press tours where he has shown his costar unrequited public affection. He does all of this, by the way, with a quill-penned letter and posh-accented narration.</p>

      <p>This video is just another in the long-storied bromance of Boyega and Isaac, which punctuates the fan-speculated romance of Finn and Poe. Since their debut in 2015's <i>The Force Awakens</i>, fans have theorized the two may harbor feelings for each other. This was potentially derailed in <i>The Last Jedi</i>, when it appeared that Finn and Rose Tico were being set up as an item, but a recent excerpt from the <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> prequel novel <i><a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-finn-rose-rey-romance/amp/">Resistance Reborn</a></i> confirms that Finn and Rose are "just friends."</p>
      <p>While it's unlikely that <i>The </i><i>Rise of Skywalker</i> will make it official (Keri Russell's new character Zorii Bliss is said to be an "old friend" of Poe's), a gay couple would be an unprecedented move for the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. Either way, the actors are clearly having fun with the idea.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives on Dec. 20.</p>
