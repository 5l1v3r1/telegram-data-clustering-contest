      <h1>Cats: Backlash From First Trailer Led to Character Redesigns</h1>

      <p>When <a href="https://www.cbr.com/cat-official-trailer/">the first trailer</a> for the upcoming<i> <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/cats/">Cats</a></i> film adaptation was released in July, many viewers were <a href="https://www.cbr.com/cats-trailer-motion-capture-uncanny-valley/">unnerved by the character designs</a>, which were accomplished via the mixing of humans and cats with CGI. However, according to director Tom Hooper, the response from the trailer is what helped with making adjustments to the looks.</p>
      <p>"We’d only finished shooting in March, so all the visual effects [in the trailer] were at quite an early stage," Hooper told <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/cats-director-tom-hooper-responds-trailer-backlash-exclusive/"><i>Empire</i></a>. "Possibly there were, in the <i>extremity</i> in some of the responses, some clues in how to keep evolving [the production]. When you watch the finished film, you’ll see that some of the designs of the cats have moved on since then, and certainly our understanding of how to use the technology to make them work has gone up, too."</p>
