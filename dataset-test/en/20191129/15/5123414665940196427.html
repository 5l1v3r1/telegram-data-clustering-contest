      <p>The world became reacquainted with <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/bag-raiders/">Bag Raiders</a> in 2017 when their 2010 hit “Shooting Stars” became one of the most prominent memes of the decade. It was random and strange, but that is how memes work. It also provided the perfect springboard for the band to complete a long-awaited sophomore album <i><a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/2019/09/review-bag-raiders-new-album-horizons/">Horizons</a></i>, which was released in September. The breezy album felt like a warm gust of clean air off of the South Australian coast. With the album still ringing true, we asked the <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/sydney/">Sydney</a> group to welcome us into their city for a <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/city-guide/">City Guide</a>.</p>
      <p>They take us around the city for the best places to drink, get some late night food and which clubs are still going strong despite the lock out laws. </p>
      <p>Catch bag Raiders at <a href="https://www.yourparadise.com/">Your Paradise Fiji</a> from December 6-12. </p>
      <p>
        <b>We all like a good drink, so where are the top spots to head to before a night out?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Love Tilly Devine, it’s a small wine bar that also serves up some great small plates so it’s ideal for that post work reset… It’s hidden away in crown lane down the bottom of Darlinghurst near William Street, which is also right around the corner from where we had our first studio! It’s sort of a hole in the wall spot, no fancy rooftop view or anything, so you can just enjoy the drinks/food and company. It’s ace. </p>

        <b>Where can you find the best clubs / late night venues in town?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sydney’s a bit hard at the moment, we’re all waiting to see what the repealing of the lot-out laws means for clubs and live venues. One spot that’s been going strong the whole time and continues to get better is Fredas. Always interesting music and a good crowd. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Brunches are a weekend staple, which spots stand out to you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lox Stock and Barrel in Bondi is the one! Brunch or lunch, it’s the best cafe around! </p>

        <b>Best dirty late-night street food option?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aside from the numerous kebab joints, (late night kebab is a must, they are good at that time especially after a few drinks) it can be pretty fun getting a slice of pizza at Frankie's, because you always have the option to not end the night right away hehe.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Your Sunday escape plan when you need to get away from it all?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Definitely by the water. Probably to Nielsen Park in Vaucluse, there’s a good cafe, and a great beach, and you can also do some nature walking with great views of the harbor around there, great place to spend the day. </p>

        <b>What is a track that reminds you of your childhood in the city?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gerling's “Enter Space Capsule.” It’s an absolute classic of a tune, I remember seeing this band at a festival when I was about 15 and they blew me away. It was one of the first shows that piqued a desire to make music with electronic elements that still burns strongly to this day! </p>

        <b>What are other great exports that come from Sydney?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A delicious beer brewed by a company that goes by the name of Young Henry’s. </p>

        <b>A gift you can’t leave Sydney without taking home for friends?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A big tin of milo. It is the greatest thing that ever happened to milk. </p>
