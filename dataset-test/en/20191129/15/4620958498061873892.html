      <p>The Surrey RCMP gang enforcement team reports that it has had three significant seizures of suspected cocaine and cash since Nov. 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>According to a release, the SGET’s continued strategic targeted enforcement in Surrey has successfully interdicted more than 30 kilograms of cocaine, $125,000 in cash, and have arrested six men in connection with drug trafficking.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 8, SGET officers conducted a traffic stop with a vehicle in the area of 152 Street and 81 Avenue where officers seized 392 grams, just under a pound, of suspected cocaine. Officers found hidden compartments in the vehicle, as well as a large large paint tray of suspected bulk, powdered cocaine.</p>
      <p>The driver and passenger were subsequently arrested for possession of a substance for the purpose of trafficking; they have been released from custody while the investigation is on-going.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 9, 2019 at 6:30 pm, SGET officers pulled over a vehicle that was swerving over the solid line in the area of 140 Street and 108 Avenue in Surrey, to check the driver’s sobriety. The driver had an expired BC Driver’s Licence, and, upon further investigation of both the vehicle and its occupants, officers found items consistent with drug trafficking, including multiple cellphones, a quantity of MDMA and currency. A further search of the vehicle, “revealed a cardboard box containing multiple bundles of cash wrapped in elastic bands, later counted to be in excess of $125,000 CAD.</p>
      <p>The driver and passenger were arrested for possession of property obtained by crime over $5000. The passenger was also arrested for drug possession. Both men have been released from custody while the investigation is on-going.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 22, a seizure of approximately 30 kilograms of suspected cocaine were seized from a vehicle when SGET Officers conducted a traffic stop in the 11900-block of 80 Avenue. During the traffic stop, officers observed a suspicious bag in the vehicle. After investigating the bag, officers found 30 individually wrapped packages of suspected cocaine. In addition, they located and seized $5000 in cash and a $25,000 money order.</p>
      <p>The driver and passenger were both arrested for possession of a substance for the purpose of trafficking and were released pending further investigation.</p>
      <p>The cocaine seized in relation to these investigations is in excess of 120,000 doses. All three of these investigations are on-going with the assistance of the Surrey RCMP Drug Unit.</p>
      <p>Drug trafficking is a significant driver of violent criminal activity, not only in Surrey, but across the Lower Mainland, said Inspector Mike Hall, Surrey RCMP Pro-active Enforcement Officer.</p>
      <p>“These three interdictions will have a significant impact on the flow of cocaine at the street level, and represent a significant financial hit to the network of drug traffickers these seizures are associated to.”</p>
      <p>Surrey RCMCP encourage anyone with information regarding drug trafficking or other criminal activity in Surrey, to call the Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502 or, if you wish to make an anonymous report, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS or <a href="http://www.solvecrime.ca/">www.solvecrime.ca</a>.</p>
