      <p><b>JUNEAU, AlaskaÂ (AP)</b> - Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy says he hopes to move past the rancor of his first year in office, amid an unsettled dispute with lawmakers over state spending and threat of a recall effort.</p>
      <p>Whether he can repair strained relationships with legislators and calm the public anger over cuts that fueled the recall push will be telling. Courts will decide whether the recall advances.</p>
      <p>Legislative leaders have called interactions with Dunleavy's new chief of staff productive and saw a recent meeting with Dunleavy as a good start.</p>
      <p>Dunleavy says the question is what Alaskans are willing to accept to resolve the deficit, such as further cuts, changes to the annual check they get from the state's oil-wealth fund or other revenue measures. His budget proposal is due by mid-December.</p>
