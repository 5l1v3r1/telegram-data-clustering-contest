      <h1>Chelsea 'plan fresh contract talks with Willian'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> are reportedly planning to hold fresh contract talks with Brazilian attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/willian/"><b>Willian</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 31-year-old, who has scored three times and contributed three assists in 17 appearances for the Blues this season, will see his current deal at Stamford Bridge expire in June.</p>
      <p>Barcelona <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/transfer-talk/news/barcelona-to-open-willian-talks-in-january_378827.html">are thought</a> to be lining up a move for the South American as he would, as it stands, be free to sign a pre-contract with a foreign club at the start of 2020.</p>
      <p>Willian <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/transfer-talk/news/willian-reiterates-desire-to-sign-new-chelsea-contract_380967.html">recently claimed</a> that he is yet to be offered a fresh deal by the club, but according to <i>The Telegraph</i>, an offer has been made to the attacker's representatives.</p>
      <p>The report, though, claims that the 'bizarre stand-off' will lead to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>'s side holding more talks with the Brazil international in the hope of agreeing an extension.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid were also said to be monitoring developments, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>'s side are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/transfer-talk/news/real-madrid-turn-down-willian-move_380226.html">allegedly now not interested</a> in bringing the attacker to the Bernabeu.</p>
