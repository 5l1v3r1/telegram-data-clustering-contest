      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:15:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1708" target="_blank">Haydn Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Football Manager 2020 is enjoying a strong launch week in the charts, beating out all the latest big releases to arrive in the top spot.</p>
      <p>It has not been a week of surprises in the EMEAA combined digital and retail charts, with all the Q4 2019 big-hitters making an appearance as we enter the holiday season.</p>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order holds fast at No. 2 in its second week, while Call of Duty hops a spot into No. 3.</p>
      <p>FIFA continues its reign as an ever present force in the charts at No. 5, nearly two months after release.</p>
      <p>Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield still hold a firm grasp despite Nintendo's refusal to publish digital sales figures, placing at No. 5 and No. 6 respectively,</p>
      <p>Grand Theft Auto V, having taken up permanent residence in the top ten, is up three spots to No. 7.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Luigi's Mansion 3 and Need for Speed: Heat continue to enjoy solid success, placing at No. 8 and No. 9.</p>
      <p>While not a permanent fixture of the top ten, Rainbow Six Siege does return with remarkable frequency, and this week finds itself at No. 10, having climbed from No. 26.</p>
      <p>Here are the Top 10 best-selling games by units (combined digital and physical) in EMEAA for the week ending November 24, 2019:</p>
