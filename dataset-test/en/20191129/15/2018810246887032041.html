      <p>Anyone who’s a serious fan of Sonic, or of Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, is probably aware of the 1993 event, <a href="https://macysthanksgiving.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog">in which a <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> float became caught in high winds</a>, struck a lamppost and injured two people. The thing is, despite knowing this happened, we didn’t have any surviving video of the incident.</p>
      <p>For over two decades, any report of the crash <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_S5P-Zr4Qw">would show either photographs of the deflated Sonic float lying on the ground, or file footage of it during testing</a>. If you actually wanted to see Sonic hit a snag and come down, <a href="https://gawker.com/i-cant-stop-watching-these-parade-balloon-accident-vide-1664120541">the footage was mysteriously missing from the internet</a>.</p>
      <p>No longer! Earlier this week, ABC7NY shared some archive footage of the 1997 Macy’s Parade, in which a Cat in the Hat float injured four onlookers. And as part of <i>that</i> segment (spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/RenandStimpySon/status/1200121171418767360?s=09">@RenandStimpySon</a>), there was file footage of the 1993 parade, clearly showing Sonic hitting a lamppost, splitting his face open then coming down on top of the crowd.</p>

      <p>While nobody was <i>seriously</i> hurt, both a child and an off-duty police officer were “slightly injured”. Sonic, meanwhile, was patched up and returned in 1994 to be the lead float.</p>
