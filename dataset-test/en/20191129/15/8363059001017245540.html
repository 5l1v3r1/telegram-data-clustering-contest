      <h1>This Fancypants Sonic Toothbrush is 70% Off for Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:00:02+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Holly Brockwell</a></address>
      <p>You'll be eating a tonne of sugary, chocolatey, unhealthy crap this Christmas (don't kid yourself, you will) – so you'll be needing a really good toothbrush to make sure you've still got any chompers left in January.</p>
      <p>Amazon's got a pretty great deal on the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean brush for Black Friday, which brings it down by 70%: from the RRP of £299 (although Amazon never sells anything for RRP, let's be honest) to £89.99.</p>
      <p>Considering it's one of the best-reviewed sonic toothbrushes, lasts two weeks on a charge and includes a fancy charging travel case and charging stand plus a two-year warranty, that's a good price.</p>

        <figcaption>Officially the happiest anyone's ever looked while brushing their teeth. This could be you!</figcaption>

      <p>The offer includes four colourways, so you don't have to have the sickly pink one just to save money: there's also black, white and rose gold, although the toothbrush itself is mostly still white on that one.</p>
      <p>The deal ends at midnight tonight (the 29th). <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01M1OJNUU?th=1">Grab it here</a>.</p>
