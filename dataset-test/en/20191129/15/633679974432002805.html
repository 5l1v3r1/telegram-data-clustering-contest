      <p>A Foundation was launched in Makhanda on Friday in the name of slain 19-year-old University of Cape Town student, Uyinene Mrwetyana.</p>
      <p>The launch at the Kingswood College High-Performance Centre was preceded by a two-kilometre march, under the banner "Together Restoring Humanity".</p>
      <p>The march was led by Rhodes University Vice-Chancellor, Dr Sizwe Mabizela, who reportedly committed R40 000 towards a scholarship for any Masters student pursuing studies in gender-based violence.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the launch Uyinene's mother, Nomangwane, spoke about how their lives were changed three months ago when the student from the Eastern Cape was raped and murdered in a Post Office in Claremont in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>"I stand here as a mother with mixed feelings, dressed in emotions of many colours. In the midst of these colours I choose the bright, glowing hues that represent Uyinene's personality ..", she said.</p>
      <p>Dr Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka delivered the keynote speech via a pre-recorded message at the event where the slain student's friends also paid tribute to her.</p>
      <p>Uyinene's killer, Luyanda Botha, was handed three life sentences early in November for her rape and murder inside a post office in Claremont, Cape Town in August.</p>
