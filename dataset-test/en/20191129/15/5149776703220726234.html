      <p>A Nottinghamshire carpenter is making unique <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> decorations from old wooden pallets which will be sold to raise money for toys for sick children.</p>
      <p>Simon Day, from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield</a>, has created a range of handmade decorations that will be sold to help the King’s Mill Hospital toy appeal deliver gifts to the children who are there this winter.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old believes the project is a “win-win” situation because of how it helps both the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/environment">environment</a>, and children in hospital during what is “a difficult time of year to be in hospital.”</p>
      <p>The sustainable festive range includes wooden Christmas trees for the garden, smaller ornamental trees and a set of decorations that can be hung. All are made from timber reclaimed from Linney’s, a marketing agency in Mansfield.</p>

      <p>Simon, who works part-time as a woodwork technician at The Ashfield School, said: “I’ve tried to work with pallet wood in the past and found it hard because it’s damaged, full of knots and it’s not meant to be good wood.</p>
      <p>“I like the idea of making something out of materials that are meant to be rubbish. I’ve been making them in batches and made a few hundred so far.</p>
      <p>“I really love woodwork and being able to do it for something so good is heartwarming.”</p>
      <p>The decorations are being sold on the Linney’s Regenerate eBay page and in the reception of their building in Adamsway, Mansfield. Some decorations will be taken to Mansfield Community Hospital too and sold there.</p>
      <p>Linney’s Regenerate team repurposes old machinery, redundant equipment and waste materials to create unique products with revenue donated to local community projects.</p>
      <p>Simon added: “I was quite pleased with how they turned out and they were straightforward to make. They’re not super modern and not too simplistic either, so I think they can work with all other decorations.”</p>

      <p>The carpenter has been working in the industry for around nine years since he studied furniture making at Lincoln College’s Newark campus, and regularly makes tables and small cabinets.</p>
      <p>Head of Linney Regenerate, Scott Tunnicliffe, said: “We encourage a culture of sustainability across our business through recycling and re-purposing projects that have a positive impact on the environment and our community.</p>
      <p>“We’re always exploring new ways to re-purpose our materials across the company – from paper and plastic, to hardware and machinery.</p>

      <p>“For this project, we’re bringing together Linney’s surplus stock and Simon’s craftsmanship to create attractive, affordable and sustainable decorations that appeal to those dreaming of a green Christmas.</p>
      <p>“We’re having a positive impact on our community, as well as the environment, by donating the proceeds of our fundraising to great local causes – such as the King’s Mill Toy Appeal.”</p>
      <p>The three different products are priced at £14 for the large garden Christmas tree, £10 for a pair of smaller trees ornaments, and £4 for a set of three hanging decorations.</p>
