        <b>It’s been a challenging week for Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool, but no one ever said sitting at the top of the tree was a holiday camp.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/history-on-liverpools-side-despite-napoli-finding-the-formula-to-stop-klopps-men"><b>A frustrating home draw against Napoli midweek has pushed qualification for the Champions League knockouts stages into the last week of the group stages</b></a>.</p>
      <p>But worse news followed with confirmation that midfield lynchpin Fabinho suffered ankle ligament damage against the Italians <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/huge-blow-for-liverpool-as-fabinho-ruled-out-until-2020-with-ligament-damage"><b>and is now almost certainly ruled out of all of the Reds’ bumper December fixtures schedule</b></a>.</p>
      <p>But despite the setbacks, Klopp continues to convey the aura of man in control of his own destiny, no matter how challenging it may seem.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/klopp-reveals-where-brighton-surpass-liverpool-tips-trio-to-replace-fabinho"><b>Despite accepting that the Brazilian’s absence was ‘absolutely bad news’</b></a> he quickly shifted the agenda to who will fill the enforcer’s shoes.</p>
      <p>He said: “We will find solutions. We are not the only team with injury problems.</p>
      <p>“We will replace him. It won’t be just like Fabinho but it will be a good one. We just have to make it work.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool entertain Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday at Anfield, where they will be fully expected to extend their unbeaten start to a season, in which they have only dropped two points and none at home.</p>
      <p>But when asked how much longer his side could maintain this remarkably high level of performance Klopp was well prepared to respond.</p>
      <p>“We don’t feel the 12 games we’ve won or the 2 ½ years without home defeat. We are not the most intense working team in the league. Brighton run more,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think about intensity. When you get up in the morning you do your best, if you wake up and don’t feel so good then you have to give your second best,” he added.</p>

      <p>Klopp’s stresses may seem relatively insignificant compared to the families of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster, who this week were left stunned by the ruling that former match commander David Duckenfield was found Not Guilty of the unlawful killing of 96 Liverpool supporters on 15<sup>th</sup> April 1989.</p>
      <p>The German had words of support, saying: “Our thoughts are with the families. We are there for them. I can imagine it is a big disappointment, frustration, sadness. We are there for them.”</p>
      <p>In light of the press conference’s running theme of challenges and adversity, which also touched on <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/unai-emery-openly-mocked-by-players-as-language-barrier-proved-catalyst-in-arsenal-demise"><b>the news that Arsenal boss Unai Emery had been given the sack on Friday morning</b></a>, Klopp was asked how football managers cope with mental health issues.</p>
      <p>After a ‘wow’ and a long pause, he gave some insight into his town mental toughness and measured approach.</p>
      <p>“It’s an intense job. I don’t think I ever read about a manager who struggled in a physical sense. You have to ignore a lot of things around you. I’m pretty good at that. Knowing about pressure doesn’t mean that you have to feel it.</p>
      <p>“Main problem is being in the public constantly. I decided a long time ago to ignore that too. If results are bad I feel bad but if they are good I feel good.”</p>
      <p>If Klopp’s wellbeing is based on Liverpool’s results then arguably he has probably never felt better but that doesn’t mean that he didn’t appreciate the question, simply signing off by saying: “On behalf of all the other managers, thank you for caring.”</p>
