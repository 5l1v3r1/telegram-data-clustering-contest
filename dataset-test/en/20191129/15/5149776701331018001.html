      <p>Mouthwatering cakes and cups of tea in vintage china cups with teapot shaped shortbread biscuits will be served at a new cafe.</p>
      <p>A sneak peak inside the Wonky Teapot ahead of tomorrow's grand opening (Saturday November 30) reveals how 19-year-old proprietor Ellie Spurr has made the former 1940s-style cafe her own.</p>
      <p>The old-fashioned decor and nostalgic knick knacks have been replaced by cute pastel pink shades, a flower wall and fluffy heart-shaped cushions at the property next to the railway line in Station Street, Long Eaton.</p>
      <p>The menu covers breakfast, lunch and tea.</p>
      <p>Croissants, toast, granola, pancakes and waffles will be served at the start of the day, with sandwiches, toasted sandwiches and soup for lunch.</p>

      <p>Sweet treats include cupcakes in different flavours such as caramel, Oreo and chocolate orange, sweet and cheese scones, and a dessert of the week - kicking off with apple pie.</p>
      <p>There will always be <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/brussels-sprout-ketchup-launched-nottingham-3574779">vegan</a> and gluten-free cakes too, starting with blueberry muffins and triple chocolate brownies on opening day.</p>
      <p>Cream teas and cupcake teas come with a choice of hot or soft drinks, while a pre-bookable <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/best-afternoon-tea-nottingham-nottinghamshire-323879">afternoon tea</a> offers the works, with tiers of sandwiches, crisps, salad, scones and cake.</p>
      <p>A hot version with toasted sandwiches, soup, cheese scones and cake is a good alternative on a chilly day.</p>

      <p>Who says it has to be 'afternoon' tea? Ellie will be offering a breakfast tea with pastries, American pancakes, warm waffles, fruit and yoghurt.</p>
      <p>The 18-seater cafe is more spacious than it was as Carriages Tea Room by moving the counter into the back room - and it's here Ellie will be busy baking.</p>
      <p>So far it's a proper family affair. Her younger sister Milly, 16, will be working there as a Saturday girl. Her mum Joanne and dad Barry, family and friends have helped with decorating since Ellie was given the opportunity to take over the cafe by her bosses at Pelgrave's restaurant next door, who also own the tearoom.</p>
      <p>Ellie, of Sawley, said: "I'm excited but a bit nervous. I've got a lot of baking to do. Everything is going to be made in-house.</p>

      <p>"I like going the extra mile and seeing people smile. I want them to come in and feel really special. I'd like to get to know people on a personal level."</p>
      <p>She said it was always a dream to have her own cafe but never expected it to happen so soon. "I definitely wanted it but I never thought it would happen, not in the next five years at least, it's crazy!"</p>
      <p>Ellie has worked as a waitress from the age of 15 for restaurant owners Jennifer and Chris Pelgrave.</p>
      <p>She has also fitted in jobs at the family-friendly Hungry Caterpillar and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/how-eat-drink-your-way-3378919">Two Guys Deli </a>in the town - some days working at all three.</p>
      <p>Former railway worker Barry said: "It's a fantastic opportunity and she was very excited. Slowly the responsibility has dawned on her.</p>

      <p>"She's got a fantastic work ethic. I think she's got all the energy and vim to go foward. It's a big learning curve because I haven't got a clue. It's a bit out of my comfort zone."</p>
      <p>While Ellie is a skillful baker, the business side is something she is having to learn. Jennifer and Chris Pelgrave have been advising her on the menu, which brands to use and costings.</p>
      <p>Between now and Christmas the Wonky Teapot will be open seven days a week and in the new year will close on Sundays, although it will be available for private hire.</p>
      <p>
        <i>The Wonky Teapot will be open 10am to 4pm Monday to Saturday and Sundays noon till 4pm.</i>
