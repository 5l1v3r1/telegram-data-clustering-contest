      <h1>Consumer Commission Fines Ford R35 Million For Kuga Fires</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:34:06+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>The National Consumer Commission has fined the Ford Motor Company R35 million for the Kuga SUV fires, which have seen a number of vehicles bursting into flames.</p>
      <p>The company has also agreed to compensate consumers affected by the fires. Compensation will amount to R50,000 each.</p>
      <p>The commission made the announcement at a briefing in Pretoria following negotiations which started earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The defective cars – which would catch alight without notice – started making headlines when Reshall Jimmy was found burnt to death in his Kuga in the Western Cape in 2015.</p>
      <p>Ford has denied being responsible for that fire, but there have been many incidents since.</p>
      <p>For a number of years now, social media would occasionally feature videos of Ford Kugas stopped on busy roads with flames and smoke billowing from their bonnets – as their helpless owners looked on.</p>
      <p>The company issued a recall in 2017, which affected about 7,000 vehicles.</p>
      <p>National Consumer Commission acting commissioner Thezi Mbuza says their investigation established that 46 Ford Kugas caught alight.</p>
      <p>She said Ford engaged in prohibited conduct by distributing a product that failed due to a cooling system issue.</p>
      <p>“Ford Motor Company of South Africa acknowledges that it is liable for the harm. It has offered to pay a sum of R50,000 to the each of those consumers who are owners of the vehicles which combusted.”</p>
      <p>Affected consumers have three choices – either accept Ford’s offer, enter a mediation process or pursue civil action of their own against the company.</p>
