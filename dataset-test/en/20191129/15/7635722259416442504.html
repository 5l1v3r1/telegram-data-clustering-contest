        <b>The Taoiseach says he is satisfied with plans put in place to care for Lisa Smith's child when the pair return to Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 38-year-old Dundalk woman travelled to Syria in 2016 to join the so-called Islamic State group.</p>
      <p>She's currently in Turkey, but is expected home within the next week.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith and her daughter <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/lisa-smith-baby-custody-turkish-officials-928300">were transferred</a></b> to Turkish custody following the bombing of the Ain Issa displacement camp in north-east Syria in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Leo Varadkar says her two-year-old daughter is an Irish citizen who should be looked after.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Templemore today, the Taoiseach said: "It is a tricky situation, and ultimately the child is an Irish citizen - and deserves to be protected in my view.</p>
      <blockquote>"Obviously as regards Lisa Smith, that's a slightly different situation - but she is our citizen, and it wouldn't be fair to expect the Turkish authorities to hold her indefinitely."</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Varadkar added: "As an Irish citizen, [Lisa Smith] is free to return home to Ireland - but if she does return home the garda√≠ are going to want to talk to her.</p>
      <p>"We need to ensure that the child's welfare is protected. Of course there are relatives who are in contact, but also Tusla are aware that that situation may arise."</p>
