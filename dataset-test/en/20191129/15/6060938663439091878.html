      <h1>Ranu Mondal's daughter gives a befitting response to trolls; says 'She is a singer, not a model'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-29T15:36:00+00:00">29 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">TNN &amp; Agencies</a></address>
      <p>A few days ago internet sensation <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranu-Mondal">Ranu Mondal</a> had grabbed everyone's attention when she attended an event and chose to give herself a makeover by leaving her usual down to earth look and opting for a beautiful outfit with the make-up look.</p>
      <p>But her overdone make-up started a meme-train on social media with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/trolls">trolls</a> poking fun at the singing sensation. While some other fans came to her rescue and questioned if she was to be blamed or the person who has done this make-up, her make-up artist too came out in open and revealed the original make-up and termed the viral picture as fake.</p>

      <p>Now Ranu Mondal's daughter Elizabeth Sathi Roy has come out in open and slammed the trolls for taking a dig at her mother. "I feel sad that she is being trolled this way. It is true that maa has always had an attitude problem, which is why she sometimes invites trouble. But it is very sad that a person who has struggled so much in her life and has finally started getting a taste of success, is being trolled so much," Sathi told IANS.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she added, "Was it necessary to make her walk the ramp? Why are they doing this? She is a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/singer">singer</a>, not a model. People are mimicking her, it's so cheap. I don't think they should be doing this to her. She does not belong to a hi-fi family. She comes from a financially backward family and she never got a chance to groom herself for the glamorous world of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a>. She used to sing on the streets and has suddenly shot to fame. She never got a chance to do a makeover of her looks or even brush up her talent."</p>
      <p>That was not it as Ranu Mondal's daughter tried to figure out the reason behind the trolling. Talking about it she added, "I feel there is a reason behind all the trolling. Ma recently told someone who asked for a selfie not to touch her. I think people are offended with her for behaving that way, because it is the common people who contributed in making her famous, by making her video go viral on social media. Maybe they are venting that anger by trolling her and creating memes."</p>
      <p>While Ranu joining the bandwagon of celebs being trolled on the internet, Elizabeth's statements have come as a befitting response to all the people behind this incident.</p>
