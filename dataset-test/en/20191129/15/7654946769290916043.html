      <h1>LeBron James helped Anthony Davis handle New Orleans boos</h1>

      <p>LeBron James has become a standard setter in the NBA  — for boos and harsh receptions, too.</p>
      <p>So nine years after James made his hostile first return to Cleveland as the city’s most hated man, he knew well enough to prepare Anthony Davis for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28180267/lakers-anthony-davis-scores-game-high-41-points-pelicans-fans-pepper-boos">what was coming Wednesday night</a> in New Orleans.</p>
      <p>It helped Davis think the welcome back wasn’t all that bad.</p>
      <p>“He went through a lot worse from what he told me. I just got boos,” Anthony <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28180267/lakers-anthony-davis-scores-game-high-41-points-pelicans-fans-pepper-boos">said after he dropped 41 points</a> to help the Lakers beat the Pelicans 114-110 in his first trip back to New Orleans since forcing a trade out of there. “I think coming in and just worrying about what was on the floor and not what the crowd was saying or whatever. I did hear something during the national anthem. That was the only time; it was super quiet. Other than that, I didn’t really hear much. I actually got some love when I was sitting on the bench from some Pelican fans.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t necessarily anything new for Davis. He had been booed on his own home court last season once <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/15/pelicans-trade-anthony-davis-to-lakers-for-monster-haul/">his request for a trade became public</a>. The Pelicans had declined to move him, making his presence there awkward, until finally sending him to the Lakers in the offseason.</p>
      <p>James got some boos from the New Orleans crowd Wednesday too, but they were mainly reserved for Davis. As someone who had been through it before — albeit in a much different situation, leaving his hometown city without a championship to go form a super team in Miami through free agency — James knew what the game meant to Davis.</p>
      <p>“We understood. I mean, any time you go back to a place you’ve made a mark, you started your career … you wanna come back and play well,” James said. “We knew that as his brothers … that goal that he had set.”</p>
