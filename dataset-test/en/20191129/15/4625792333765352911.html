      <h1>Ex-GOP lawmaker: Republicans 'wrestling' with whether to turn on Trump</h1>

      <p>A former Republican lawmaker said his former colleagues are publicly standing with President Trump as he faces impeachment, but in private they are dismayed by his conduct.</p>
      <p>Republican lawmakers aren’t yet feeling pressure to turn against Trump because “the base has not yet bolted from the president,” former Rep. Charlie Dent told CNN.</p>
      <p>“But there’s no question, having spoken to many of them privately, they’re absolutely disgusted and exhausted by the president’s behavior,” said Dent, who resigned from Congress in 2018. “They resent being put in this position all the time.”</p>
      <p>“I think they’d like to step out, but they just can’t because of their base at the moment,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dent said many of his former colleagues are “wrestling” with whether it’s more important to stand up the president or win their next election.</p>
      <p>“There’s still time. Give them a little time,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also said if he were still in Congress he would have supported the impeachment investigation, but cautioned Democrats against impeaching Trump until they hear from primary witnesses about the president’s conduct toward Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think they should force this or rush this,” Dent said, urging Democrats to wait for potential testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>
