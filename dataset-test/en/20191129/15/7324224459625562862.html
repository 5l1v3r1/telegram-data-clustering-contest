      <h2>Work to build more than 70 new canal-side apartments on derelict Walsall land could start as soon as January after plans were given the green light.</h2>

      <p>Walsall Council’s planning committee backed the proposal to redevelop the former Metafin site in Green Lane into two blocks of flats at their meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In their proposal, applicants Square Space Ventures Ltd said the scheme would help redevelop the empty site and also provide ‘surveillance’ in an area that has suffered from anti-social behaviour in the past.</p>
      <p>The land is still currently owned by powder coating firm Metafin – which has relocated to a new base in Northcote Street – and Tony Corbett, from Square Space, said it intends to reinvest proceeds from the sale of the Green Lane site into expanding their operation.</p>
      <p>A total of 72 one and two bedroom flats will be constructed within the two blocks while 72 parking spaces will also be created.</p>
      <p>Some concerns were raised by committee members about the level of parking being proposed but highways said they believed it was acceptable and, along with planning officers, backed the proposal.</p>
      <p>Members granted delegated powers to planning officers to secure a section 106 agreement for almost £17,000 to be contributed towards the provision of affordable housing and open space.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbett said: “We’ve been working for 12 months with planners to bring forward this derelict site.</p>
      <p>“It is currently owned by Metafin who relocated to Northcote Street and if this can be brought forward, it will enable them to invest in their new site.</p>
      <p>“I gather they have a planning application ready which, although nothing to do with us, is nevertheless evidence of the intention to bring new jobs and employment on their current site.</p>
      <p>“This site has no statutory objections and is supported by planning officers and this demonstrates that it can be delivered and our intention would be to commence construction in January, if we get the appropriate agreement signed off.”</p>
