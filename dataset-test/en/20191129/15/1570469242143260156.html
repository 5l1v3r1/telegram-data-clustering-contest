      <p>The Russian military is on a mission to upgrade its nuclear arsenal.They have now tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile called the RS-12M Topol.</p>
      <p>True to its nature, the Kremlin has revealed very little details about the missile's potential.</p>
      <p>The test was conducted at the Kapustin Yar military range in southern Russia and that the missile hit the designated target about 2,100 kilometres away in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>The visuals of the launch offer an exciting view of the launch which took place at night.</p>
      <p>The Topols have been a loyal servant of the Russian military and was inherited from the soviet union. The NATO calls it the SS-25 sickle.</p>
      <p>The Kremlin is planning to commission modern and more mobile versions of the missile called the 'Topol-M' in the early 2020s, thereby replacing the older ones.</p>
