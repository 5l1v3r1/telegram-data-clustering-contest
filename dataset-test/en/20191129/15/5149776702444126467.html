      <p>Notts County defender Christian Oxlade-Chamberlain has sealed a loan move to Ilkeston Town.</p>
      <p>The former Portsmouth player has struggled to break into the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies'</a> side this season.</p>
      <p>And it has led to Ilkeston swooping for the right-back who can also play in the centre of defence.</p>
      <p>The deal will on run until January 1 when the transfer window reopens for Football League clubs.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain, brother of Liverpool star Alex, has made just one appearance this season which came on the opening day of the season in the 1-0 defeat at Eastleigh.</p>

      <p>Last year he made just three appearances after arriving on a permanent deal from Oxford City with one of those games coming at Oldham where he was sent off.</p>
      <p>His departure follows that of another defender Pierce Bird who last week joined Boston United in Conference North.</p>
      <p>It leaves right-back Matt Tootle and midfielder Tom Crawford as the only two players left on the books that are struggling to break into <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Neal Ardley's</a> first-team.</p>
