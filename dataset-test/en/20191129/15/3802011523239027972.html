      <p>The Spaniard, who previously led Paris St-Germain to the French league title and won three Europa Leagues with Sevilla, was appointed Gunners boss in May 2018, succeeding Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>He has been replaced on a temporary basis by assistant and former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg.</p>
      <p>Arsenal said the decision had been “taken due to results and performances not being at the level required”.</p>

      <p>The Gunners have not won in seven games and lost 2-1 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It is their worst run without a victory since February 1992, which was eight games under George Graham.</p>
      <p>They are without a Premier League victory since 6 October and eight points off the top four.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg took training on Friday and the Arsenal statement added: “We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward.</p>
      <p>“The search for a new head coach is under way and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete.”</p>
      <p>Ljungberg posted on social media: “However long I oversee Arsenal for I will give everything I have to put smiles on faces again. We have a busy few weeks ahead and the team needs your support. Let’s get to work.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s head of football Raul Sanllehi and technical director Edu informed Emery at about 09:00 on Friday and the players were told at 10:00 as they arrived for a recovery session.</p>
      <p>Ljungberg addressed the players and Emery also had the chance to say goodbye.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, BBC Sport reported Arsenal had identified Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo as a potential replacement for Emery.</p>
      <p>Other names linked with the post include former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, Manchester City assistant coach Mikel Arteta, ex-Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri and Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal Supporters’ Trust (AST) said Emery’s dismissal was “unfortunate but inevitable” and the “more difficult challenge is to recruit a suitable successor”.</p>
      <p>It added: “We are far from certain that Arsenal has the right personnel to lead this process.</p>
      <p>“The AST has long been advocating that the most important changes needed at Arsenal are in the boardroom where Arsenal need better governance.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal finished fifth in 48-year-old Emery’s first season in charge at Emirates Stadium after he replaced Wenger.</p>
      <p>They went into this season having spent more than £130m in the summer after signing winger Nicolas Pepe, centre-back David Luiz, left-back Kieran Tierney, striker Gabriel Martinelli and defender William Saliba, who will join next summer.</p>
      <p>The club also brought in midfielder Dani Ceballos on loan from Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>They started this season with back-to-back victories against Newcastle and Burnley, but that run ended with defeat by Liverpool, before draws with north London rivals Tottenham and Watford followed.</p>
      <p>Their last Premier League victory was a 1-0 win over Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, they battled to a 2-2 draw – their sixth of the season – at home to Southampton, with Alexandre Lacazette scoring an injury-time equaliser.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have conceded 19 goals in 13 top-flight games this season and former Gunners keeper Bob Wilson said the team’s defensive statistics were “frightening”.</p>
      <p>“The interesting thing is every successful side starts with the defence,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p>
      <p>“Look at Liverpool and them spending millions [£75m] on Virgil van Dijk, who has made their defence solid.</p>
      <p>“They [Arsenal] are shipping goals and don’t seem to have any idea of the defensive structure.”</p>
      <p>Emery is the third managerial dismissal in the English top flight this season, after Javi Gracia and Pochettino departed Watford and Tottenham respectively.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s last victory came against Vitoria Guimaraes in the Europa League on 24 October, in which they needed two late Pepe free-kicks to secure a 3-2 win. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/amp/football/50532493"><b>BBC Sport</b></a></p>
