        <i>The announcement by Bond University and RMIT follows the royal’s interview about his links to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</i>
      </p>
      <p>Two Australian universities have severed ties with a business mentoring charity founded by Prince Andrew after the royal’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/prince-andrew-denies-sex-with-teenager-as-at-home-after-pizza-party">train-wreck interview about his links to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>The Pitch@Palace program – founded by the prince in 2014 – supports entrepreneurs and start-up companies and gives them the opportunity to pitch their idea to business leaders at places including Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>The Australian branch, Pitch@Palace Australia, held its annual pitching contest on 4 October, at Government House in Perth, hosted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-andrew">Prince Andrew</a> himself.</p>
      <p>Pitch@Palace Australia lists four universities as “host partners”, but Melbourne’s RMIT University and Bond University in Queensland have now formally ended their association.</p>
      <p>Another, the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, said it would be reviewing their relationship. The fourth “host partner”, Murdoch University in Western Australia, has been contacted for comment.</p>
      <p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/19/prince-andrew-student-body-calls-for-royal-to-step-down-huddersfield-university-as-chancellor">multiple corporate partners have also deserted</a> the charity – including Standard Chartered, Aon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/18/kpmg-ends-its-backing-for-prince-andrews-mentorship-scheme">and KPMG</a>.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night, the Duke of York <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/top-lawyer-calls-prince-andrew-bbc-interview-catastrophic-error">gave a much-derided interview</a> to the BBC where he denied accusations of sexual assault and defended his links to the financier and convicted child sex offender Epstein.</p>
      <p>In response to allegations from Virginia Giuffre (formerly Roberts) that she was trafficked to the duke and had sex with him when she was 17, Prince Andrew claimed he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/prince-andrew-denies-sex-with-teenager-as-at-home-after-pizza-party">at home after a pizza party</a>.</p>
      <p>The duke also said he regretted staying at Epstein’s house, but thought it was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/prince-andrew-believed-staying-with-jeffrey-epstein-right-thing-to-do">“honourable and right” thing to do</a>, and a “convenient place to stay” at the time.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Bond University confirmed that its involvement with the charity would end “in light of recent events”.</p>
      <p>“Our current agreement with Pitch@Palace Australia finished this year,” she said. “We have previously said any new agreement would be considered in 2020.</p>
      <p>“However, in light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for RMIT said its involvement in Pitch@Palace “concluded in October 2019”.</p>
      <p>“We remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring RMIT is a safe and inclusive place to work and study.”</p>
      <p>The University of Wollongong said it was “currently undertaking an annual review of its future involvement in Pitch@Palace”.</p>
      <p>“The university remains committed to supporting entrepreneurship and small business in Australia, and its assessment will include consideration of whether Pitch@Palace remains an effective avenue to deliver that support.</p>
      <p>“The university will reach a considered decision about its future involvement with Pitch@Palace based on the university’s strategic objectives, institutional values and the program’s potential for success.”</p>
      <p>Pitch@Palace was founded in 2014 to “provide a platform to amplify and accelerate the work of entrepreneurs”, according to its website.</p>
      <p>An Australian version began in 2017, and the third instalment (Pitch@Palace Australia 3.0) took place in October.</p>
      <p>According to the website, 42 entrepreneurs took part this year, pitching to “an influential audience of potential supporters, including CEOs, influencers, mentors and business partners”.</p>
      <p>Three winners were invited to the global event, held in St James’s Palace in London.</p>
      <p>The global program claims to have generated more than £1.3bn ($2.46bn) in global economic activity across 64 countries.</p>
