      <h1>From ‘Rocket’ rockets to a draft bolter — and a desire to prove Giants wrong</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:49:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:49</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Balmer</a></address>
      <h3>Eight months ago, the last thing on Cooper Sharman’s mind was getting drafted.</h3>
      <p>In fact, the teenager had just moved from his home town of Leeton in country New South Wales to live on campus at Deakin University in Victoria, where he would study a Business/Commerce degree.</p>
      <p>The one-time GWS Academy member tried his luck at Balwyn Football Club, in the local Eastern Football League, under the guidance of former AFL coach Rodney ‘Rocket’ Eade.</p>

      <p>But it all soon changed, after recruiters became aware of a lanky forward who could leap high and hit the scoreboard at local level.</p>
      <p>“(I) played majority of first grade, I got dropped a couple of times into the seconds, (but) I enjoyed my time in the Eastern Football League, it was pretty tough,” Sharman explained to <i>foxfooty.com.au</i>.</p>
      <p>“The boys at Balwyn got around me, bit of youth in the team as it was an older team. I was playing good footy at Balwyn then got called up to Oakleigh and was straight in the side there. I played seven or eight games and played in a premiership – it was the last thing I expected. It has been a whirlwind.</p>
      <p>“There was a couple of games where there were recruiters there. There was a bit of talk about it. I was going out to warm up against Blackburn and a couple of boys said they saw recruiters. The nerves go up a bit when clubs come out to watch local footy. It didn’t faze me too much when I got out there.</p>

      <p>“I think I went alright, kicked three goals and took a couple of marks in the wet.”</p>
      <p>Sharman’s influence on the recruiters was clear, as the 192cm forward earned an invite to the national combine held in October.</p>
      <p>As for the guidance from ‘Rocket’, Sharman declared he was “really approachable” and was “awesome” for his development.</p>
      <p>“I was a bit nervous coming down when he was going to be coach but he’s been awesome,” he said.</p>
      <p>“No individual (sprays), but a couple of good team sprays.”</p>
      <p>Sharman could’ve been a Giant if not for a differing of opinion, with the club dumping him after pre-season contests.</p>
      <p>“I did a full pre-season heading into a top-age year, so last year and I probably didn’t play well enough in the trial games to get selected,” he said.</p>

      <p>“I definitely thought I was good enough to make the side and it still burns my belly and I want to prove them wrong that I was good enough to be there.”</p>
      <p>Bouncing back with 13 senior goals for Balwyn and 14 goals in eight appearances for the Chargers, Sharman looms as a prospect likely to find a home on night two of the draft.</p>
      <p>As for what has changed since missing out on the academy squad, Sharman believes he was now a more trusted prospect in terms of what recruiters were looking for.</p>
      <p>“Probably just the consistency in my footy (has improved),” he said.</p>

      <p>“Last couple of years as a 17 or 18-year-old, I was good in patches but couldn’t string two or three games together in a row. But this year I’ve been able to do that and been able to perform for a whole game.</p>
      <p>“Not coming into the year with any expectations makes it easier. If it doesn’t happen well then that wasn’t my goal at the start of the year.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got something to fall back on, I’d have a crack at VFL footy and continue my studies.”</p>
