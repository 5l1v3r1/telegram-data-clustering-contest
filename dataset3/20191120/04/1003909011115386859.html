      <p>Calgary and surrounding areas are under a <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?ab12#2056157581334238639201911180501ww1575cwwg">snowfall warning</a> which could last until Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>A low-pressure system that moved into Calgary early Tuesday morning is expected to bring 10 to 15 centimetres of snow.</p>
      <p>Calgary road crews are currently focused on high-volume priority one roads (Crowchild, Memorial Drive, Glenmore) and these roads will continue to be plowed until the snow stops, which will then activate the city’s seven-day snow plan. The city is also using salt on the roads to help accelerate melting.</p>
      <p>The city added that they do not anticipate needing to call for a parking ban on designated snow routes.</p>
      <p>The snow is expected to taper off by Wednesday morning as the system moves into Saskatchewan. </p>
      <p>Drivers in Calgary will have to deal with slippery streets and low visibility.</p>
      <p><a href="https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/ab-52_metric_e.html">Weather agency Environment Canada</a> is also reminding drivers to prepare for quickly changing conditions as highways and roads may be difficult to drive on as the snow accumulates. The agency is also reminding people to turn on their headlights if visibility is reduced and follow at a safe distance. </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://511.alberta.ca/#:Alerts">511 Alberta</a>, all the Highways around Calgary are currently covered in snow and ice.</p>
      <p>The wintery weather is not expected to last that long. By Thursday, Environment Canada is predicting sunny skies for Calgary with a high of 7 C. </p>
      <p>The bad news? <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/weather-network-predicts-frigid-temperatures-more-snow-in-alberta-this-winter">The Weather Network </a>is predicting a winter for Calgary that’s slightly colder and snowier than average.</p>
