      <p>The opening stanza of the Mike Anderson era had provided little but thrills.</p>
      <p>Three low-major opponents came to Queens and left with double-digit losses, unable to match the talent or effort of a new-look St. John’s squad, insistent on outperforming its low projections. Then came Vermont — the reigning America East champion, expected to return to the NCAA Tournament — which escaped the borough with a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/furious-st-johns-rally-falls-just-short-in-loss-to-vermont/">70-68 win on Saturday</a>.</p>
      <p>The season’s first true test ended with shock, with the Red Storm’s late double-digit comeback only increasing the pain inflicted via Anthony Lamb’s game-winning jumper with two seconds remaining. The next challenge comes in the response, entering Wednesday’s game against Columbia at Carnesecca Arena (7 p.m., FS1).</p>
      <p>“Take the loss, look at it and move on. You learn from it and move on,” senior Mustapha Heron said. “You can’t dwell on anything. A win or a loss. Another day’s coming. We’re past that. … How open are you to learning from your mistakes and just getting better?”</p>
      <p>In opening the season with back-to-back 30-point wins, Heron scored 55 points — the most by a St. John’s player in the team’s first two games in 29 years — while shooting 17 of 28 from the field, including 10 of 13 on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>Since then, St. John’s most explosive scorer has struggled to find his shot.</p>
      <p>In the Red Storm’s up-and-down performance against New Hampshire, Heron hit 2 of 12 from the field and tied a career-low with five points. In the loss to Vermont, the preseason All-Big East Second Team selection made just 3 of 11 shots.</p>
      <p>“I was getting the same shots I was getting before,” Heron said. “I just gotta knock them down.”</p>
      <p>This weekend, St. John’s (3-1) hits the road for the first time in the Basketball Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament, where the Red Storm will play Arizona State, and either No. 7 Virginia/UMass.</p>
      <p>First come the Lions (1-3), who nearly won at Wake Forest last week.</p>
      <p>“I always say, each game is going to be a test for this basketball team,” Anderson said.</p>
