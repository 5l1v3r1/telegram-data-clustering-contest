      <p>OPELIKA, Ala. (AP) — A preliminary hearing is scheduled for a man charged in the kidnapping of a missing college student who’s the stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight Walt Harris.</p>
      <p>Ibraheem Yazeed is scheduled to appear before a judge Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Yazeed is charged in the disappearance of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard. She was last seen Oct. 23 in Auburn, Alabama. She hasn’t been found.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a motion seeking permission to take a DNA sample from Yazeed. A judge said he will hear arguments on the request Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Blanchard’s car was found abandoned more than 50 miles (90 kilometers) away. Police said the car contained evidence that Blanchard had suffered a life-threatening injury.</p>
      <p>The charging document says a witness identified 29-year-old Yazeed as the man he saw force Blanchard into a car.</p>
