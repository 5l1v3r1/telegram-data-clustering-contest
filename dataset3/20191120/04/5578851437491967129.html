        <b>The Independent Election Commission, or IEC, has started the transfer of recounted votes from the provinces to the data center in Kabul, despite opposition by some election campaign teams who demand a halt to the process.</b>
      </p>
      <p>One member of the commission, Awrangzeb, said that so far the data of six provinces, including Bamiyan, Logar, Maidan Wardak, Laghman and Balkh, have been sent to Kabul, and votes from 15 provinces have been recounted.</p>
      <p>According to Awrangzeb, the vote recount has not started in Takhar, Badakhshan, Jawzjan, Panjshir, Faryab and Sar-e-Pul provinces due to opposition by some election campaign teams.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a letter from Dermalog, the biometric company, sent to the IEC on Nov. 12, shows that 102,012 votes have been cast outside of the hours of polling day – Sept. 28 – and some election campaign teams are asking for invalidation of these votes.</p>
      <p>“We have sent in a vote list that should be considered and investigated more,” Awrangzeb said.</p>
      <p>From the 102,000 votes, 86,851 votes have been used on the election day but outside the scheduled time for polling which was from 7am to 5pm. Moreover, 23,197 votes were used one day ahead of the polling day and 8,762 votes were used one day after the election day.</p>
      <p>Also, 203 votes were used two days ahead of the election day and 297 votes were used two days after the election day.</p>
      <p>But the Stability and Convergence election campaign team, led by Abdullah Abdullah, said the IEC should not validate votes that have been cast out of the polling time.</p>
      <p>“If they (IEC) make a mistake, it cannot be corrected for in a national and decisive manner, and if it is intended then it is betrayal,” said Fazl Ahmad Manawi, a member of Abdullah’s team.</p>
      <p>“The Commission is not independent in its decisions and cannot give a clear and satisfactory answer,” said Nasir Nasiri, a member of the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan.</p>
