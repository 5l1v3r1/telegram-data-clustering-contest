      <h1>Sources: China tariff demands may expand 'phase one' trade deal significantly - Reuters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:35:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Reuters quotes people familiar with the US-China talks, as saying that a “phase one” trade deal between the US and China could expand if US President Trump yields into Beijing’s demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>
      <p>The sources said: “Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to canceling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Trump said on Tuesday that he will "just raise tariffs" if the US doesn't make a deal with China.</p>
      <p>As for Wednesday’s trading so far, the risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> remains sour amid fresh concerns over the US and China on the Hong Kong human rights bill approved by the US Senate. This may spillover to the impending US-China trade talks and render negative for the much-awaited trade deal.</p>
