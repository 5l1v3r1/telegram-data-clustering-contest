      <h2>Eden Hazard says Chelsea FC have what it takes to beat Man City in the Premier League on Saturday night</h2>

      <h3>Eden Hazard says that Chelsea FC have what it takes to go to Manchester City and win in Saturday’s Premier League showdown at The Etihad.</h3>
      <p>The Blues head into the game in fine form, having won their last six Premier League games under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC were 2-0 winners over Crystal Palace in their most recent top-flight outing, a result which left them third in the table and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Manchester City, meanwhile, suffered a disappointing 3-1 defeat by Liverpool FC last time out to leave them down in fourth place in the table and behind Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>Hazard was part of the Chelsea FC team who lost 6-0 to the Citizens at The Etihad back in February when Maurizio Sarri was still in charge.</p>
      <p>However, Hazard – who has since signed for Real Madrid – feels that Lampard’s young team have what it takes to claim all three points given their impressive recent form under their new manager.</p>
      <p>Asked to give his prediction for the game, Hazard is quoted as saying by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/eden-hazard-chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-11179118/">Metro</a>: “It’s not going to be easy. It’s hard to play there.</p>
      <p>“Last time we played them we lost 6-0, so bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well.</p>
      <p>“But I think this season they are really good. They are really young, but they are really good, so why not go there and win the game?”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC have won eight of their opening 12 games, drawing two and losing two, following Lampard’s appointment as Sarri’s successor back in July.</p>
