      <h3>Geelong forward Gary Rohan has extended his contract at Kardinia Park until the end of 2021 after an eye-catching start to his time at the Cats.</h3>
      <p>The 28-year-old emerged as one of the best recruits of the year in the first half of the season, kicking 20 goals from the first nine rounds before slowing down after the mid-season bye.</p>
      <p>Rohan, who was traded to the Cats for Pick 61 last October after nine years at Sydney, finished with 25 goals – an equal career-high – from 19 games – the most he has played in one season.</p>

      <p>The Geelong Falcons product still had a year to run on the deal he signed when he departed the Swans, but the Cats have rewarded him early for his output.</p>
      <p>“Gary was able to enjoy a strong start to his career in Geelong colours at the beginning of the season,” Geelong’s head of football Simon Lloyd said.</p>
      <p>“He made a smooth transition into our team and was an energetic addition to the group both on and off the field.</p>
      <p>“Since arriving 12 months ago, Gary, his wife Amie and daughter Bella have been a welcome addition to the club, as a family they have embraced everything about the community of Geelong.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to have secured Gary’s services for a further two years and look forward to what he can bring to the team.”</p>

      <p>AFL.com.au has also reported that Cats have tabled a three-year contract extension to star midfielder Mitch Duncan, which would lock him in until the end of 2023.</p>
      <p>Geelong’s first to fourth-year players reported back for pre-season training at Deakin University on Monday.</p>
      <p>Brownlow medallist Patrick Dangerfield and new recruits Josh Jenkins and Jack Steven were on the track, along with Duncan, two weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
