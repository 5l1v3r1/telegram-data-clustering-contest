      <h1>UK election debate: Common ground that UK austerity is over – Rabobank</h1>

      <p>The Rabobank research team is out with its take on the UK PM Johnson and Labour Party leader Corbyn debate that ended on a sour note.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Finally, the first televised UK election head-to-head debate between BoJo and Corbyn produced an outcome that saw one viewer respond sadly, “I wouldn’t buy a used car from either of them”. Indeed, the extremely rowdy TV audience, by UK standards, left the distinct impression the public see <i>both</i> men as being rear parts of a horse’s anatomy.</p>
      <p>The two disagreed on almost everything, including how to pronounce Epstein--Corbyn managing to sound either very ‘rootsy’, or uncomfortably anti-Semitic, given his unorthodox “EpSHtein” over the more usual confusion on whether it is “Epsteen”; even the royal family were in the firing line. However, there was common ground that UK austerity is over.</p>
      <p>In terms of changing voters’ minds, Corbyn had an exceptionally easy ride considering how radical some of Labour’s manifesto policies are, being free to focus on BoJo’s untrustworthiness and the NHS.</p>
      <p>Corbyn’s only major weakness, besides being accused of anti-Semitism, was <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a>, where there was still no commitment as to which way he would campaign in his proposed second referendum: BoJo pointed out the EU would hardly agree to a new deal with Labour if they don’t know if the government would back it in a subsequent plebiscite.</p>
