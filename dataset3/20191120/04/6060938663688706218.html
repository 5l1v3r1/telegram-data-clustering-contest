      <h1>Viswanathan Anand is still a force to reckon with: Magnus Carlsen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:47:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Prasad-RS-479236858.cms" target="_blank">Prasad RS</a></address>
      <p>CHENNAI: The last time world No. 1 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/magnus-carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> set foot on India was in 2013 - when he was a challenger to the then world champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/viswanathan-anand">Viswanathan Anand</a>. Exactly six years later, the 28-year-old arrives for the penultimate round of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Grand-Chess-tour">Grand Chess tour</a> as the indomitable force in world chess.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian is understandably excited at the prospect meeting his fans in the country. "I have not returned to India since winning the world title and it will be great to be back in the country. India is very special place for me since I have always admired watching (Viswanathan) Anand for so many years and the way he has carried himself. Playing him against will be great," Carlsen told TOI on Monday.</p>
      <p>Anand - who will turn 50 next month - may be competing with the best in the business even today, but Carlsen doesn't see the five-time former world champion adding another world title to his kitty. "To be honest, Anand competing for the world title again looks unlikely. I feel Anand has so much class that he will be a force to reckon with in top tournaments. But, in terms of fighting for the world title - it's is highly unlikely at this point," he said.</p>
      <p>He may be playing in the strongest of tournaments across the globe but Carlsen always has an eye on the Indian talent. Carlsen is impressed by the form shown by Indian Grandmasters - R Praggnanandhaa and Nihal Sarin. "I have been very impressed by Praggu and Nihal. They seem to be very strong in playing against top players and have the potential to be world-beaters," Carlsen said.</p>
      <p>Carlsen - who has been in great form this year winning an astonishing seven titles - conceded that he hasn't been at the peak of his powers in recent times. The Fischer Random World title loss to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Wesley-So">Wesley So</a> in Norway earlier this month only added to the agony. "I have not played so well in rapid and blitz (events) recently and want to show who is the boss at the Grand <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chess">Chess</a> tour in Kolkata. It is going to be a very tough field but I am geared up to do well," he said.</p>
      <p>Carlsen was in the news for having moved out of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Norway-Chess">Norway Chess</a> Federation, but he made it clear that he will continue supporting the country in whichever way possible. "I think I am still on good terms with the leadership in the federation. (The move of going out) was more of a symbolic gesture of protest but I will still want to continue promoting chess in Norway," said Carlsen.</p>
