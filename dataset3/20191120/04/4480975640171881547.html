      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“We expect the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> minutes from the October meeting to elaborate on the Committee's decision to ease rates while also sending a firm signal to set the bar high for additional accommodation.</p>
      <p>We anticipate discussions to touch upon what "material reassessment" of the outlook would lead the FOMC to shift its policy stance. The minutes may also provide further insights into the Framework Review debate.”</p>
