      <p>Two families were left homeless and property worth thousands of dollars was burnt beyond recognition when lighting struck a Chikanga house in Manicaland.</p>
      <p>Fortunately all the occupants of the house escaped without a scratch as they managed to evacuate the house before the fire spread to their rooms.</p>
      <p>A tenant at the house, Lanet Duduzile Mushongani who also lost property told <a href="https://www.manicapost.co.zw/lightning-bolt-torches-chikanga-house/">The Manica Post</a> that she and her two-year-old baby were lucky to be alive as they were deep in the throes of sleep when the lightning bolt struck.</p>
      <p>She said the lightning bolt struck the house twice before it started a fire on the curtains.</p>
      <aside>“It was around 6pm when the first lightning bolt hit our lounge window and broke it. We just thought it was a passing thing and went to sleep after cleaning up the mess.<br/>“An hour later, the lightning bolt struck again, resulting in a fire in the same room. We were all asleep by then and did not know what was happening,” said Mushongani.</aside>
      <p>They had to be woken up by neighbors who saw the fire.</p>
      <p>According to neighbors, the fire brigade took 40 minutes to arrive and they only managed to contain the fire in two of the three rooms, because they had little water.</p>
      <aside>“They had to go back to get more water and that is when the fire spread into the third room and destroyed everything,” said a neighbour who only identified himself as Mr Makarimai.</aside>
