      <p>The event is <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/great-american-smokeout-set-for-thursday/4KyJORQ2qu1AwIeTj2UhzI/">sponsored</a> by the American Cancer Society. The organization said smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death and illness in the world, causing an estimated 480,000 deaths every year. </p>
      <p>More than 16 million Americans live with a smoking-related disease, even though cigarette smoking rates have dropped from 42% in 1965 to 14% in 2017.</p>
      <p>For more than 40 years, the American Cancer Society has hosted the Great American Smokeout on the third Thursday of November.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/great-american-smokeout-set-for-thursday/4KyJORQ2qu1AwIeTj2UhzI/">According to the organization</a>, the idea grew from a 1970 event in Randolph, Massachusetts where Arthur P. Mullaney asked people to give up cigarettes for a day and donate the money they would have spent on cigarettes to a high school scholarship fund. </p>
      <p>In 1974, Lynn R. Smith, editor of the Monticello Times in Minnesota, spearheaded the state’s first D-Day, or Don’t Smoke Day. </p>
      <p>The idea caught on, and Nov. 18, 1976, the California Division of the American Cancer Society got nearly 1 million people who smoke to quit for the day. </p>
      <p>That California event was the first official <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/great-american-smokeout-set-for-thursday/4KyJORQ2qu1AwIeTj2UhzI/">Smokeout</a>, and the American Cancer Society took it nationwide in 1977. </p>
      <p>Many public places and work areas are now smoke-free – protecting nonsmokers and supporting people who smoke but want to quit. </p>
