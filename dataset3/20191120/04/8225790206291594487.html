      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) -A royal celebration to honor one of Hawaii’s monarchs is being planned by the Friends of Iolani Palace.</p>
      <p>Guests will be taken back in time with nighttime tours of the palace. It’s all in honor of Queen Kapiolani’s 185th birthday.</p>
      <p>The nighttime tours — which are only being offered on three nights — will take place from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. They’ll take place from Dec. 28 through Dec. 30.</p>
      <p>Guests will have the chance to walk the halls of the palace after hours in the rare tours. Earlier this year, the palace grounds were placed off-limits overnight to curb vandalism and loitering.</p>
