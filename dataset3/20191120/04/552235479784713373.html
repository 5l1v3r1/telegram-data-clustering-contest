      <p>Dreich has beaten braw, glaikit and scunnered to be named as the "most iconic Scots word" by the Scottish Book Trust.</p>
      <p>It received 259 of the 1,895 votes cast in a poll as part of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/books-and-literature">Book</a> Week Scotland which was run with the hope of prompting discussion around well-loved and well-used words.</p>
      <p>Originally meaning "enduring" or "slow, tedious", over time dreich has come to be defined as "dreary, hard to bear" and "dull, gloomy".</p>
      <p>Braw, which is defined as "fine, good, or pleasing", came eighth in the poll with just 77 votes, while glaikit - translated as "stupid, foolish; thoughtless, irresponsible" - received 225 votes for second place.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Scottish Book Trust chief executive Marc Lambert said: "We were overwhelmed by the many submissions for our iconic Scots words vote - it's certainly a subject close to people's hearts.</p>
      <p>"Dreich is such an evocative word with the ability to sum up the Scottish weather - or mood - perfectly. It's also a word that is very well used here in Scotland and beyond.</p>
      <p>"It's fantastic to see the vibrant conversation around Scots language as we celebrate Book Week Scotland."</p>
