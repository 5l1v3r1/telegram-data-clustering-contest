        <b>As one of the greatest French Enlightenment writers, François-Marie d'Arouet (1694–1778), who was better known by his pen name “Voltaire,” was a prolific writer and witty philosopher. He dedicated his life to advocating for social concerns on critical issues in the society, such as religious dogma, French government establishments of the time, and the intolerance in the community. Many years after his death, Voltaire quotes seem to reflect on what is happening in society.</b>

      <ul>
        <li>A lady of honor may be raped once, but it strengthens her virtue.</li>
        <li>Dogs, monkeys, and parrots are a thousand times less miserable than we are.</li>
        <li>Men...must have corrupted nature a little, for they were not born wolves, and they have become wolves. God did not give them twenty-four-pounder cannons or bayonets, and they have made bayonets and cannons to destroy each other.</li>
        <li>What is optimism?', said Cacambo. 'Alas!' said Candide, 'it is the mania of maintaining that everything is well when we are wretched.</li>
        <li>The malevolence of men revealed itself to his mind in all of its ugliness.</li>
        <li>I confess that when I consider this globe, or rather this globule, I think that God has abandoned it to some evil creature.</li>
        <li>Observe that noses were made to wear spectacles, and so we have spectacles. Legs were visibly instituted to be breeched, and we have breeches. Stones were formed to be quarried and to build castles; and My Lord has a very noble castle; the greatest Baron in the province should have the best house; and as pigs were made to be eaten, we eat pork all year round; consequently, those who have asserted all is well talk nonsense; they ought to have said that all is for the best."</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Christianity is the most ridiculous, the most absurd, and bloody religion that has ever infected the world.</li>
        <li>The Bible. That is What fools have written, what imbeciles commend, what rogues teach, and young children are made to learn by heart.</li>
        <li>Of all religions, the Christian should, of course, inspire the most tolerance, but until now, Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.</li>
        <li>Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense.</li>
        <li>Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool.</li>
        <li>“God is a comedian playing to an audience that is too afraid to laugh.</li>
        <li>Voltaire religion quotes about Christianity</li>
        <li>Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.</li>
        <li>Needless to say since Christ’s expiation not one single Christian has been known to sin, or die.</li>
        <li>The Jews have always been waiting for a Messiah, but their Messiah is for them only, not for us, a Messiah who will give them mastery over the Christians.</li>
        <li>If we would destroy the Christian religion, we must first of all destroy man’s belief in the Bible.</li>
        <li>The son of God is the same as the son of man; the son of man is the same as the son of God. God, the Father, is the same as Christ, the son; Christ, the son, is the same as God, the father. This language may appear confused to unbelievers, but Christians will readily understand it.</li>
        <li>We are all full of weakness and errors; let us mutually pardon each other our follies.</li>
