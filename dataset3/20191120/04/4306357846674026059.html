      <h3>Joe Cole says that Chelsea FC are “quietly chipping away” at Liverpool FC as they bid to haul themselves into the Premier League title race.</h3>
      <p>The Blues have been in fantastic form in recent weeks and they have won their last six games in a row in the top flight to leave them third in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are currently level on points with Leicester City in second and both clubs are eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>The west London side have recovered well from a 4-0 thrashing by Manchester United on the opening weekend of the season and they have been earning lots of praise for their recent displays under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea FC midfielder Cole feels that the Blues can continue to slowly climb the table and says that they should not be ruled out of the Premier League title race.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <i>BT Sport</i> after Chelsea FC’s 2-0 win over Crystal Palace, Cole said when asked if the Blues are in the title race: “They’re quietly chipping away it it.</p>
      <p>“Frank won’t thanks us because he’d like to be even more quiet.</p>
      <p>“Going into this two-week break, you can really take stock and see how well Chelsea have done. They’re in there amongst it now.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action on Saturday night with a crunch clash against Manchester City at The Etihad.</p>
      <p>The Blues are aiming to try and finish in the top four once again this season after having ended up third last term.</p>
