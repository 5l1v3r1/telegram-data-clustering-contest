      <p>The Chairman of the Oyo State Internal Revenue Service (OYIRS), Aremo John Adeleke who spoke during a visit from a group of individuals under the aegis of “Friends of Seyi Makinde” in Oyo state said that the Oyo State Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) for October rose to about N2.7billion as he added that it was a clear departure from between N1.2 to N1.3 billion monthly IGR inherited from the previous administration.</p>
      <p>“…We are bringing about a revolution in revenue generation activities of Oyo State. Oyo today has moved beyond the miasma of revenue of between N1.2billion and N1.3billion per month in IGR.</p>
      <p>“I am happy to inform you that last month, our IGR was N2.7billion and we intend to keep on in this trajectory…”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is Internally Generated Revenue (IGR)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) is the revenue that state governments generate within their states. It involves taxes and levies collected from all sectors. The IGR is usually the calculation of PAYE, road taxes, revenue from Ministries, Departments and Agencies and other taxes collected from businesses, markets, companies and organizations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verification</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Oyo state gotten from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed that the average IGR generated in Oyo state from 2017 to the first quarter of 2019 showed that Oyo state was N1.3 billion.</p>
      <p>Although the National Bureau of Statistics did not provide monthly IGR information, the average of the quarterly IGR showed that the least average generated by Oyo state from 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 is N1.3 billion.</p>
      <p>The IGR for 2017 was N18,879,084,134  which places the average IGR made monthly at N1.5 billion. In the first quarter of 2018, N5,405,584,026 was generated putting the average monthly at N1.3 billion.</p>
      <p>The IGR generated in the second quarter of 2018 was N6,974,296,229 placing the average IGR monthly at N1.7 billion while the IGR generated in the third quarter was N5,882,490,179 placing the monthly average IGR at N1.4 billion monthly.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Governor Seyi Makinde took over the government of Oyo state on May 29, 2019, which is after the first quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>Data on the IGR generated in Oyo state from the first and second quarters of 2019 showed N14,060,685,978 of which an average monthly showed that N1.7 billion was generated.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before May 29,2019, which was the day the new administration of Oyo state Governor, Seyi Makinde, data received from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the least average of Oyo state Internally Generated Revenue before Governor Seyi Makinde’s administration was N1.3 billion.</p>
