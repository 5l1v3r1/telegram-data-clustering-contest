      <p>But, before we share you the method to Login to Snapchat account on PC, please keep in mind that there’s no official way to use Snapchat on PC. So, we eventually need to rely upon Android or iOS emulators to emulate the Snapchat app on a computer. This thing can lead to an account ban. So, make sure to use these methods at your own risk.</p>
      <p>If you have been using an Android or iOS device for a while, then you might know about the Snapchat application. Snapchat is widely popular amongst smartphone users, and its a platform used to share photos, videos, text, and drawings.</p>
      <p>When it was launched, it has created quite a stir among youths from all across the world. Within a short period, the app got viral due to its unique concept. Apart from being a media sharing platform, Snapchat is also known for its concept of volatile or self-vanishing messages and fun photo filters.</p>
      <p>However, the most popular messaging app, of course, Snapchat, is limited to only mobile devices. The company doesn’t provide an option to run Snapchat on the computer, neither it had a web client. So, if you are just like me, who spends most of the time on the laptop, then you might feel the pain of manually checking the smartphone again and again.</p>
