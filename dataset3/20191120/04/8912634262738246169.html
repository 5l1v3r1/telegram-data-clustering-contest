      <p>BANGKOK: The billionaire frontman of Thailand’s anti-military parliamentary bloc is set to hear a controversial ruling Wednesday that could see him banned from politics and jailed for up to 10 years.<br/>The leader of the upstart Future Forward party, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 40, has been a fierce critic of the army’s role in Thailand’s turbulent politics, which has seen at least 12 coups since 1932.<br/>His success at the ballot box has shaken up the arch-royalist power structure after millions of youthful supporters helped Future Forward become the third-largest party in March elections ending five years of outright junta rule.<br/>The party’s popularity also earned the charismatic leader a spot in Time’s 100 Next list released earlier this month.<br/>But he has been suspended from attending parliament since the Election Commission accused him of breaking polling laws by holding media shares.<br/>Thailand’s Constitutional Court is set to rule on the case at 0700 GMT.<br/>Thanathorn says the legal challenge is intended to hobble the party, which has called for an end to military conscription and a slash in defense spending.<br/>The court disbanded a different anti-military opposition party linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra right before the March vote.<br/>Thanathorn has repeatedly insisted the 675,000 shares he held in V-Luck Media were sold to his mother on January 8 — weeks before he registered to run as a candidate.<br/>But he said last week that regardless of the decision the reformist Future Forward is much stronger than it was a year ago.<br/>“It is not about me; it is about other dreams,” he said, adding that whatever ruling is handed down he will not step away from politics.<br/>His rival is Thai premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha, a general who led the coup in 2014 and was voted in as civilian premier with the help of junta-appointed senators.<br/>Future Forward has also come under fire for being a rare voice of criticism against Thailand’s royalist establishment.<br/>The monarchy, one of the world’s richest and headed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, is at the apex of Thai power.<br/>Last month, 70 Future Forward MPs voted against a royal decree transferring two key army units to the direct control of the king — an unprecedented political objection to a royal command.<br/>The decree still passed parliament with an overwhelming majority.</p>
