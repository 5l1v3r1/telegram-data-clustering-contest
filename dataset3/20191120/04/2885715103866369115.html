      <p>Martin Scorsese directorial The Irishman, which is already playing in select US theaters, will get a wider release on Netflix on November 27. The streaming giant recently released a final trailer for the movie which is being touted as the ultimate Scorsese epic.</p>
      <p>The almost three-minute-long video gives us a glimpse of what happens when the tricky worlds of the mafia and politics collide. People are campaigning for <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/john-f-kennedy">John F Kennedy</a> as the US President, while slowly, within the closed doors of the American-Irish underworld, Robert De Niro has entered in the form of a ‘carpenter’ who also happens to ‘take out people’ when needed.</p>
      <p>Unlike the previous trailers, the final clip from the movie shows us the multiple timelines within which The Irishman operates. We get to see a relatively younger De Niro with his little daughter and an older De Niro asking for forgiveness from his grown-up child.</p>

      <p>The video also gives us a taste of the chemistry and friendship Robert De Niro shares with co-star Joe Pesci (the duo had famously collaborated on movies such as Goodfellas and Casino, also helmed by Scorsese).</p>
      <p>The Irishman is the longest Martin Scorsese feature yet, running at 3.5 hours. Also, starring Al Pacino and Ray Romano, the film has been penned by Steven Zaillian.</p>
