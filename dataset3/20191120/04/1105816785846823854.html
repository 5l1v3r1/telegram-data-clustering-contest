      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>To foster closer cultural ties, a month-long Japanese Festival commenced in the federal capital on Tuesday with a special martial arts demonstration and other contests portraying the Japanese culture.</p>
      <p>Japanese Ambassador Kuninori Matsuda, who inaugurated Japan Festival 2019 at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) on Tuesday along with the varsity’s Rector Major General (retired) Muhammad Jaffar, said that since Japan and Pakistan share many cultural similarities, the festival will definitely provide a window of opportunity for locals to discover many facets of Japanese culture and its age-old traditions.</p>
      <p>The ambassador reiterated that 2022, when Pakistan and Japan celebrate the 70th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, will be fully celebrated through a variety of events.</p>
      <p>Matsuda stressed upon the need to make continued efforts to further strengthen the bonds of friendship between Japan and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>The festival began with a Japanese Speech Contest amongst students of NUML’s Japanese language department.</p>
      <p>It was followed by traditional Japanese cultural performances such as kendo — a traditional Japanese martial arts form to demonstrate Japanese sword fighting, taiko — traditional Japanese drum-beating — performance, karate and judo demonstration, a ninjutsu performance, an origami workshop, bonsai and ikebana demonstrations.</p>
      <p>The robotics department of the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) presented a robotic performance which greatly entertained students. The festival also offered scrumptious Japanese cuisines such as Tempura and Sushi.</p>
