      <h1>2021 Aston Martin DBX Breaks Cover</h1>
      <h2>Aston Martinâ€™s first SUV has finally arrived.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:00:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>A new era for Aston Martin has begun. While the British automaker is renowned for making luxury grand-tourers and stylish sports cars, today marks the introduction of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/dbx">Aston Martin DBX</a>, the first-ever SUV and the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/heres-why-the-dbx-is-a-big-deal-for-aston-martin">most important model in the company's 106-year history</a>. Think of it as Aston Martin's answer to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bentley/bentayga">Bentley Bentayga</a>, Lamborghini Urus, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/cayenne">Porsche Cayenne</a>.</p>
      <p>Combining the versatility and comfort of a luxury SUV with the performance of a sports car, the DBX rides on a new lightweight dedicated SUV platform that utilizes bonded aluminum, resulting in a curb weight of under 5,000 pounds and a cabin with "class-leading spaciousness" for front and rear occupants. The platform's stiffness also gives the DBX exceptional driving dynamics both off- and on-road.</p>

      <p>Adaptive triple volume air suspension, a 48V electric anti-roll control system, and electronic adaptive dampers enhance the DBX's ability. Using the air suspension, the ride height can be raised by 1.77 inches or lowered by 1.97 inches, allowing the DBX to tackle a variety of terrains. In maximum ride height, the DBX has a ground clearance of 9.25 inches. The adaptive triple chamber air springs also enable variable spring stiffness and are capable of 1,033 ft-lb of anti-roll force per axle. This can limit the DBX's body roll to improve its agility and make it handle more like a sports car than an SUV.</p>
      <p>Powering the DBX is the same 4.0-liter, twin-turbo V8 found in the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/db11">DB11 </a>and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/vantage">Vantage</a>, tuned to deliver 542 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. While it retains the characteristic sound of an Aston Martin, the active exhaust system can make the luxury SUV sound refined or exhilarating when required.</p>

      <p>The turbocharged V8 also features cylinder deactivation technology to enhance fuel economy. Despite this, the DBX will sprint from 0-62 mph in 4.3 seconds and on to a top speed of 181 mph. Power and torque are sent to the tarmac via a nine-speed automatic gearbox and an all-wheel-drive system with an active central differential and an electronic rear limited-slip differential, while the steering has been tuned to feel and respond like a sports car.</p>
      <p>It's practical, too. Inside the spacious cabin, the DBX has room for five occupants. Behind the second row, the DBX has 22.3 cu. ft. of trunk space, which increases to 54.0 cu. ft. with the 40:20:40 split rear seats folded down to store a variety of luggage such as suitcases, golf bags, and ski equipment. Featuring extensive use of high-quality materials such as metal, glass, and wood, the luxurious handcrafted cabin offers class-leading headroom and legroom, while a glass panoramic roof and frameless doors provide a light and spacious environment.</p>

      <p>The bridged center console includes a 10.25-inch screen, while a large 12.3-inch infotainment screen displays a wealth of information to the driver. Apple CarPlay comes as standard, along with a 360-degree camera and ambient lighting that offers 64 different colors in two zones.</p>
      <p>An assortment of <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-dbx-will-satisfy-all-your-luxury-needs">available accessory packages</a> can also adapt the DBX to suit different lifestyles. A Pet Package, for example, will include a portable washer to prevent muddy paws ruining the upholstery, while the Snow Package includes boot warmers to make ski trips more comfortable. Despite being the automaker's first SUV, the DBX is still instantly recognizable as an Aston Martin thanks to signature design elements such as the iconic 'DB' grille at the front, sculptured sides, and a design feature line, while the rear lights and tailgate flip are clearly inspired by the Vantage.</p>

      <p>Hidden side glass seals, frameless doors, and glass B-pillar finishers give the DBX a sleek and sophisticated appearance. To optimize the aerodynamics, the daytime running lights have an integrated aerodynamic duct channelling air through the front wheel arches and along the side, helping to reduce both drag and lift while also cooling the brakes.</p>
      <p>The first 500 owners will receive a '1913 Package' that includes a unique fender badge, sill plaques and a plaque detailing its limited build-run. Each customer will also receive a unique build-book signed by Aston Martin's CEO and Chief Creative Officer Marek Reichman.</p>

      <p>"DBX is a car that will give many people their first experience of Aston Martin ownership," said Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer. "As such it needed to be true to the core values established in our sports cars, while also providing the lifestyle versatility expected of a luxury SUV. To have produced such a beautiful, hand-built, yet technologically advanced car is a proud moment for Aston Martin."</p>
      <p>Pricing for the Aston Martin DBX starts at $189,900 plus a $3,086 destination and handling charge, with North American customer deliveries starting in the second half of 2020.</p>
