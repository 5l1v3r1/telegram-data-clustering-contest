      <p>Southeast Asian stock markets fell on Wednesday amid fears that trade talks between Beijing and Washington could be derailed after US President Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs and the US Senate passed a bill aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>Trump said on Tuesday he had a good relationship with China, noting that Beijing was "moving along", it said.</p>
      <p>Kenanga IB Research said Asian markets closed mixed yesterday as investors remain cautious on trade uncertainty.</p>

      <p>"Chart-wise, the index has managed to climb back to its 1,600-point level amid improved market sentiment.</p>
      <p>"The index remains above the 20- and 50 day-SMAs (simple moving averages) while other momentum indicators appear rangebound, suggesting a possible consolidation near current levels.</p>
      <p>"From here on, overhead resistance can be seen at 1,630 (R1) and 1,650 (R2). Conversely, key support levels can be found at 1,570 (S1) and 1,550 (S2)," it said.</p>
