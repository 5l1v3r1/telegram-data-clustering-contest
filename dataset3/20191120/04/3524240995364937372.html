      <p>The French Embassy in Nigeria has appointed its first female Consul General, Laurence Monmayrant.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a press briefing commemorating her first visit to Nigeria, the newly appointed Consul General commended the efforts of the Federal Government in making the country a safer place for businesses to thrive and attracting foreign investment.</p>
      <p>Monmayrant said the French government was looking forward to increased growth in the Nigeria-France business relationship.</p>
      <p>She said, “About 10 years ago, Nigeria had over six different French companies, but today, there are over 130 French companies in Nigeria. The relationship is worth celebrating because it has continued to grow, as well as the French interest in Nigeria.”</p>
      <p>Monmayrant stated that the Nigerian government, through the presidential enabling business council, had implemented 140 reforms in three years, since its set-up.</p>
      <p>This, she said, was clearly shown in the latest ease of doing business rankings, where Nigeria moved 15 more places up, after having moved 24 places just a year ago and ranked as the top 10 most improved economies in the world for the second time in three years.</p>
