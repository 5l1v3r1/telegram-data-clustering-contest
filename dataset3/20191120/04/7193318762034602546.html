      <p>A 15-time Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and global superstar, Keys will return as host of the Grammy Awards, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>Last year’s ceremony marked Keys’ first time hosting an awards program and was met with praise from fans and critics alike. Her opening monologue featured special guest appearances from former first lady Michelle Obama, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Jada Pinkett Smith. A standout moment when Keys played two pianos simultaneously in tribute to black pianist Hazel Scott became a top social moment according to Facebook.</p>
      <p>“At first, I did think last year was a one-time thing, but when the opportunity came back around, there was no question about returning as host of the Grammy Awards,” said Keys in a statement. “Last year was such a powerful experience for me. Not only did I feel the love in the room, but I felt it from around the world, and it confirmed the healing and unifying power of music.”</p>
      <p>I'll be scouring the Grammy Award nominations list Wednesday morning for contenders with Oklahoma ties. Look for updates on my BAM's Blog Wednesday.</p>
