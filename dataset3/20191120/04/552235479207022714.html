      <h1>Brexit Party candidate in Nazi-era German helmet row not using real name in election</h1>
      <h2>Colin Mitchelson's nickname and middle name are listed on official papers for the General Election.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>A Brexit Party candidate who was criticised for posing in a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/aberdeen-north-tory-candidate-ryan-20911180">Nazi-era</a> <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/aberdeen-north-tory-candidate-ryan-20911180">German</a> helmet is not using his real name in the election.</p>
      <p>Ex-soldier Colin Mitchelson, who is contesting Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, is listed as “Mitch William”, which includes his nickname.</p>
      <p>Scottish Green candidate Scott Rutherford said: “People are telling me this election is important because it is electing an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/aberdeen-north-tory-candidate-ryan-20911180">MP</a> that could sit for five years.</p>
      <p>“They want someone who will take issues seriously like the climate emergency and the future of Mossmorran. It’s not a fancy dress competition.”</p>

      <p>Mitchelson, who used to be an aide for eccentric former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/aberdeen-north-tory-candidate-ryan-20911180">UKIP</a> MEP David Coburn, hit the headlines in 2017 over photographs of himself next to his then boss’s home in France.</p>
      <p>The selfie showed him wearing headgear that was similar to the helmets worn by SS troops.</p>
      <p>At the time, a UKIP spokesman it would be an “outrageous slur” to suggest any Nazi link, adding that Mitchelson had worn several pieces of military headgear from Coburn’s large collection.</p>
      <p>He added: “This is someone who has served the country in uniform in Bosnia and Afghanistan.”</p>
      <p>It has now emerged Mitchelson is contesting the Fife marginal won by Scottish Labour deputy leader Lesley Laird in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mitchelson is listed as the election agent for Mitch William, but both men are the same person. Candidates are allowed to use commonly known forenames and surnames on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/aberdeen-north-tory-candidate-ryan-20911180">ballot</a> paper.</p>
      <p>Mitchelson has used his real name in previous elections.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Fife Council said: “Mr Mitchelson is standing under his commonly used name of “Mitch Williams”</p>
      <p>“However, there’s no such provision for agents in relation to commonly used names - they must give their full names, which he has done.</p>
      <p>“As a result he will appear on the ballot paper with one name but is on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/aberdeen-north-tory-candidate-ryan-20911180">list of agents</a> under a different name.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Brexit Party said: “‘Mitch’ is what the candidate is known as. William is a middle name. Our lawyers tell us it is not uncommon to use a name other than that on one’s birth certificate.”</p>
      <p>The spokesman denied Mitchelson is using "Mitch William" because he was embarrassed by the 2017 story.</p>
