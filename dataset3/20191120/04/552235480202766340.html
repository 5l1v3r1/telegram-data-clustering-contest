      <h1>Scots conman who fleeced victims out £840K is ordered to pay back just £25,000</h1>
      <h2>Swindler Stewart Kennedy fleeced his victims and battered one with a baseball bat.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rory Cassidy</a></address>
      <p>A callous conman who raked in £840,000 through <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/financial-crime">crime</a> was ordered to hand over just £25,000 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Swindler Stewart Kennedy fleeced his victims and battered one with a baseball bat.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old told investors that a franchise in his business, was “the financial opportunity of a lifetime” for them.</p>
      <p>But he used their money to go on two trips to the US, costing nearly £30,000, and paid for his son’s £1400-a-month flat in London.</p>
      <p>He took £144,267 in cash and spent the money in clothes shops, outlets in London’s Camden area, supermarkets, jewellers and the upmarket Corinthian Club in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He went on a Disney Cruise, visited New York, Florida and Greece, and bought tickets to Rangers games, jewellery for his wife and meals in restaurants.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors had been seeking to recover £151,452 from Kennedy, claiming he made £661,350 from his crimes.</p>
      <p>Kennedy had previously submitted a letter denying he lived “a criminal lifestyle”.</p>
      <p>But at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paisley">Paisley Sheriff Court</a> yesterday, it emerged he had agreed to pay back £25,000 after prosecutors discovered he had made £840,000 through crime.</p>
      <p>That figure was revealed through Proceeds of Crime laws, which allow the authorities to examine a criminal’s finances in the years before they committed their offence.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>At the hearing yesterday, Sheriff David Pender gave Kennedy six months to hand over the cash.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, who was caged for four years in January last year, has already been released from jail.</p>
      <p>Among those duped was plumber Stuart Caldwell, who was battered with a baseball bat by Kennedy when he went to his home in Quarrier’s Village, Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire, to find out what had happened to his £33,000 investment.</p>
      <p>Crook Kennedy told investors they would receive a minimum of £4600 per month for 10 months as a return on each £15,000 sum they invested.</p>
