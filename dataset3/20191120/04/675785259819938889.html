      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:19:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:19</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A 'cowardly' thug beat an 84-year-old grandmother in a nursing home bedroom, leaving her with horrific injuries.</p>
      <p>The attacker broke in through the Patricia's window and proceeded to bash her face, chest and arm.</p>
      <p>The woman was left bloodied and bruised after the ordeal at Huon Park retirement complex, in Sydney, Australia, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Neighbours in the picturesque village were flabbergasted by the brutal assault, which left the victim and her family in a state of shock.</p>
      <p>Local resident Chris Griffith reportedly said: "This is a very quiet village, one of the benefits of the place is that it's very secure, it is a concern for everyone."</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7703553/Grandmother-discovered-horrific-facial-injuries-nursing-home-room.html">Mail Online</a>, Detective Chief Inspector Luke Spurr added: "'This is an absolutely appalling and cowardly act and let me reassure you these type of offences are uncommon and that police are doing everything in their power to fully investigate this matter and to locate the offender."</p>
      <p>The suspect was apparently wearing a tie, shirt, trousers and a jacket when he set upon the pensioner.</p>
      <p>Police described him as having a medium build, brown eyes, dark hair, aged between 30 and 50, around 180cm tall and of Asian or Indian appearance.</p>

      <p>The beating comes two months after 77-year-old Patrick Murphy was battered by a vicious gang of thugs who stole his shopping as he walked home from a supermarket.</p>
      <p>The grandfather-of-four, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, has been left with a badly bruised face and says he is now too afraid to venture out of his house at night, reports <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/royal-navy-veteran-77-battered-20140383">the Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>And he said he would love to ask his attackers: "Are you proud of yourselves, for attacking a pensioner?"</p>
