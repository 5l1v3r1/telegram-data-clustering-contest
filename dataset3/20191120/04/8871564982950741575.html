      <h1>Chinese man sentenced to 8 months for entering Indonesia without a passport</h1>

      <p>The Denpasar District Court has sentenced a 45-year-old Chinese man identified as Dacheng Yan to eight months in jail for entering Indonesia without a valid travel document or visa. </p>
      <p>“The defendant Dacheng Yan is proven guilty of entering or being in Indonesia without valid travel document and visa. [He violated] Article 119 of the 2011 Law on Immigration,” <a href="https://kumparan.com/kanalbali/masuk-bali-tanpa-paspor-warga-china-dibui-8-bulan-1sHeLzt0m92">presiding judge Soebandi told the court yesterday, as quoted by <i>Kumparan.</i></a><i> </i></p>
      <p>Under the 2011 Immigration law, entering Indonesia without valid travel document or visa is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of IDR500 million (US$35,484).</p>
      <p>The court also ordered Yan to pay a fine of IDR50 million (US$3,548). His final sentence is lighter than what prosecutors had previously demanded, which was one year in prison.</p>
      <p><a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/nekat-traveler-chinese-man-faces-trial-in-bali-after-entering-indonesia-without-a-passport/">As previously reported</a>, Yan managed to enter Indonesia by riding a motorcycle to Pontianak, West Kalimantan, from Sabah, Malaysia.</p>
      <p>He was able to elude immigration officers, presumably because of his choice of land transportation, and he reportedly continued his journey in the archipelago by hopping on a ship headed for Surabaya, East Java, before moving on to visit Denpasar.</p>
      <p>Yan has reportedly spent a few days on the island when he decided to scale the wall of the Chinese Consulate-General in Denpasar on Sept. 14, for which he was detained and later handed over to the Immigration Office in Denpasar.</p>
