      <p>The RFS Mid North Coast Team will be holding bushfire update meetings at Kalang and Thora this week.</p>
      <p>The meetings are intended to inform Kalang/Brierfield and Darkwood/Thora residents about the current status of the Kian Road, Carrai East and Guyra Road fires and to reinforce the message of being prepared and having your Bush Fire Survival Plan in place.</p>
      <p>NSW RFS has said the <a href="https://www.bellingencourier.com.au/story/6501038/fears-massive-fires-could-join/?cs=483">Carrai East fire is likely to merge with the Guyra Road Ebor</a> fire soon.</p>
      <p>The update will provide the most current information from the Incident Management Team about the status of the fires and potential risks, including fire weather predictions for coming week.</p>
      <p>There will also be a question and answer session.</p>
      <p>Other meetings will be held around the Bellingen Shire as required.</p>
      <p>The first meeting will be held at Kalang Community Hall at 6pm on Thursday November 21.</p>
      <p>In attendance will be Kalang RFS Brigade, Brierfield RFS Brigade, Scotchman RFS Brigade, Superintendent Sean McArdle - Manager Mid North Coast and John Allen - Community Liaison Officer.</p>
      <p>The second meeting will be held at Thora Community Hall at 6pm on Friday November 22.</p>
      <p>Attending the event will be Darkwood RFS Brigade, Thora RFS Brigade, Jason Booth - District Officer, Mid North Coast and John Allen - Community Liaison Officer.</p>
      <p>Tea and coffee will be provided at both meetings.</p>
      <p>Residents of these specific areas are encouraged to attend. The RFS prefers that residents from other areas do not attend as their concerns can sidetrack the discussion.</p>
      <p>Other meetings will be held around the Bellingen Shire as required.</p>
