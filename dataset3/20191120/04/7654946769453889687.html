      <h1>Kyrie Irving’s injury status looking a bit more bleak for Nets</h1>

      <p>The Nets will be without Kyrie Irving for a third straight game as a lingering shoulder injury continues to sideline the point guard longer than expected.</p>
      <p>Ahead of their matchup with the Hornets at Barclays Center on Wednesday, coach Kenny Atkinson said Irving didn’t participate in practice in any capacity Tuesday. And Atkinson’s optimism regarding Irving’s status has begun to fade as the team prepares for another game without him.</p>
      <p>On Monday when the Nets faced the Pacers, Atkinson said he was hopeful Irving’s injury wouldn’t be a long-term issue. But a day later, the coach was much more careful with his words.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to comment on that,” Atkinson said. “I think it’s way too early. I think it’s day-to-day right now. I think he’s working his tail off to get back. So, I definitely don’t want to speculate on the time frame.”</p>
      <p>There is still no definitive timetable for Irving’s return. A specialist who spoke with The Post during the Nets’ road trip suggested Irving would be well advised to rest for several days, or even a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>“I said it before the game, I do know shoulders, that’s not fun,” Atkinson said. “I think we’ve probably all had something there. That’s just having full range of motion and being able to move that is so big, so obviously, he’s not feeling right. He will be out again [Wednesday]. I know he’s getting a ton of treatment. He’s living in the training room. Just got to get through it.”</p>

      <p>Caris LeVert had his cast removed Tuesday after having surgery to repair ligaments in his right thumb.</p>
      <p>There is no updated timeline on his return, but LeVert said he will begin his rehab now that he has the cast off. The injury, which he said first happened at the beginning of last year and was aggravated this month in Phoenix — forces LeVert to do other forms of rehab that don’t include using his right hand.</p>
      <p>“I can still do lower-body lifts, some running, biking as well,” LeVert said. “Trying to just stay in shape as much as I can until I’m cleared to start dribbling and shooting.”</p>
      <p>LeVert missed three months with a dislocated foot last season and had foot surgery before the start of his rookie season in 2016. He said he feels extremely familiar with the rehab process, but because it’s a new injury, it will be a different challenge to tackle.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t say frustration, it happens,” LeVert said of dealing with another injury. “Honestly, I’m glad it’s only a short amount of time, it’s not a long injury like last year. It’s not something I’ll be sidelined for a long stretch of time. I’m doing things to keep my mind focused on the game, I’m watching a lot of film and things like that. Just another road bump.”</p>
