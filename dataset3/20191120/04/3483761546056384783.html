      <p>The fires that have razed much of NSW ever recent weeks, destroying homes and killing four people, have left many Hunter residents wondering what they can do to help those in need.</p>
      <p>Here is a list of practical things residents can do that will make a difference to those who are displaced, injured or who lose their homes and belongings.</p>
      <p><b>Recycle your old bottles and cans</b>: Instead of putting your cans and plastic bottles in regular your recycling bin, separate them and place in a TOMRA reverse vending machine. TOMRA and Rural Aid have teamed up to create a new initiative <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.bottlesforthebush.org.au_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&amp;r=aY9hBqbp9XDoykpagqqfe7l1fELLkj9EuZfwq6Ghyu8&amp;m=5BmRuWWdTTbmhB9l9TSPmQsSphsidnXczAPg3WVlVeI&amp;s=vFHoh6V1TqKTu5XjCm4jwIqfD4u1KWcBzpcMKparQe0&amp;e=">Bottles for the Bush</a> to assist in raising $250,000 for bushfire and drought relief. Every eligible drink or can donated through these machines will go towards the delivery of hay, water, live stock feed and food supplies. Every 10 cents donated helps, providing relief to Australian families that are doing it tough over the Christmas and New Year period.</p>
      <p><b>Donate blankets and clothing: </b>With many families fleeing their homes at short notice, there are people in evacuation centres who only have the shirts on their backs. If you have any unused blankets and clothing lying around the home, you can donate it to evacuation centres through charities like <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__donate.vinnies.org.au_appeals-2Dnsw_vinnies-2Dnsw-2Dbushfire-2Dappeal-2Dnsw&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&amp;r=aY9hBqbp9XDoykpagqqfe7l1fELLkj9EuZfwq6Ghyu8&amp;m=5BmRuWWdTTbmhB9l9TSPmQsSphsidnXczAPg3WVlVeI&amp;s=CFQaQnJISo0O9tDYIO40DLgqBmRQiX76j9n9goNyKF8&amp;e=">Vinnies</a> and <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.salvationarmy.org.au_donate_make-2Da-2Ddonation_donate-2Donline_-3Fappeal-3Ddisasterappeal&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&amp;r=aY9hBqbp9XDoykpagqqfe7l1fELLkj9EuZfwq6Ghyu8&amp;m=5BmRuWWdTTbmhB9l9TSPmQsSphsidnXczAPg3WVlVeI&amp;s=LDbheezmqr-Is1qnc4QQK92t9Ayc7E9lTCHa7MKGPMg&amp;e=">Salvos</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Open your home to pets: </b>All creatures big and small need somewhere to stay during bushfires and droughts. Across social media you can register your interest to give a range of animals places to stay during bushfires. Pets can stay overnight or even just for a couple hours. You can also register to help evacuate and transport cattle and horses.
