      <p>PITTSBORO, N.C. (AP) — A Confederate statue has been removed overnight from a historic North Carolina courthouse.</p>
      <p>Chatham County officials issued a news release late Tuesday night saying work had begun to take down the soldier that stood in front of the courthouse in Pittsboro since 1907.</p>
      <p>News outlets report that a subdued crowd of several dozen watched the work. Even the base of the statue was gone before dawn.</p>
      <p>It has been rare for public officials to take down Confederate statues in North Carolina since the enactment of a 2015 state historic monuments law restricting the removal of public monuments.</p>
      <p>But county officials argued in court that the monument was private property, owned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and a judge hearing the group’s challenge declined to block the removal.</p>
