      <blockquote>About Game:<br/>This game contains two game modes basic and expert and each mode contains three puzzle boards (4x4 to 6x6) with hundreds of puzzles. The basic mode contains single colored emojis (up to 3 emojis) and the expert mode contains multi colored emojis (upto 3 emojis).<br/>Main Goal:<br/>The main goal is to put all the emojis to their homes within given number of moves. Swipe (left, right, up, down) on the screen to move the emojis. The blocks or hurdles on the board will prevent emojis to move further in the swiped direction. Every emoji move is synchronized e.g if you swipe left and there are three emojis on the board every emoji will move left to the last movable cell. In expert mode you must put every emoji to its matching color home.</blockquote>
