        <li>Do not let them drag you down by rumors just go with what you believe in.</li>
        <li>Look me in the eye. It’s okay if you are scared. So am I. But we are scared for different reasons. I am scared of what I could become. Look at me. I won’t let myself end where I started. I won’t let myself finish where I began. I know what is within me, even if you can’t see it yet. Look me in the eye. I have something more important than courage. I have patience. I will become what I know I am.</li>
