      <h1>CBE will cut 300 temporary teaching jobs to cover 'gap' left by provincial budget</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:30:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">Yolande Cole</a></address>
      <p>About 300 teachers on temporary contracts have received notice that their contracts will end as of Jan. 2, 2020, Calgary Board of Education Supt. Christopher Usih said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Usih said in a statement that the teachers received verbal notice Tuesday and will receive official notice Wednesday. The teachers will be placed on the substitute teacher roster on Jan. 3 and a number of them “may be considered for future temporary contracts.”</p>
      <p>At a board of trustees meeting last week, staff presented a budget assumptions report, which included strategies to balance the budget.</p>
      <p>“The Oct. 24 provincial budget left the CBE with a $32-million shortfall,” Usih said. “As this is a mid-year cut, the CBE must act quickly to present a balanced budget to the board of trustees before January 2020.”</p>
      <p>He added the CBE is in the process of making “several other decisions to cover our budget gap,” which will be communicated to staff and parents as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“This budget decision impacts many of our schools, classrooms, and students,” Usih said. “We will continue to support positive transitions and effective teaching and learning. Continuity of learning is important, and we are working to minimize disruption to the greatest extent possible.”</p>
      <p>Budget reductions discussed at the board meeting last week included <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/cbe-announces-where-32-million-in-provincial-cuts-are-coming-from">cutting the overall funding</a> allocated to 246 schools by $22 million, or 2.5 per cent. Officials said that will mean some temporary employee contracts will be eliminated and some central and area-based staff will be redeployed to schools.</p>

      <p>Bob Cocking, president of the Alberta Teachers’ Association Local 38, said the cuts will have a ripple effect.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just the lives of these teachers that are being affected,” he said. “We already saw class sizes go up a little bit this year anyway, because the board cut $22 million in the spring . . . Now, by removing these teachers, class sizes for sure are going to go up.”</p>
      <p>Cocking said the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/cuts-to-education-mean-students-will-lose-teachers-get-shuffled-into-other-classes-midway-through-school-year">timing of the cuts</a> will be especially challenging for schools, noting these kinds of layoffs have never happened mid-year.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be quite an upset in each school,” he said. “And the teachers who just found out today are just devastated.”</p>
      <p>He said many of those affected are likely new teachers.</p>
      <p>“You’re upsetting the lives, at the beginning of a career of somebody,” Cocking said. “So devastating for them.”</p>
      <p>One teacher who was told Tuesday that his contract will end Jan. 2 said his biggest worry is for his students.</p>
      <p>The teacher, who asked not to be identified, said he might need to look at moving to B.C. for work.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if there’s many choices for me in Alberta,” said the teacher, who is in his third year of teaching.</p>
      <p>He added he doesn’t blame the CBE or his school for the cuts.</p>
      <p>“My board was told that they’d maintain funding, and then (Oct. 24) comes around and they’re told that this school board alone is losing $32 million,” he said. “They already planned on just a freeze, so it’s mid-year and they have to make all these cuts. I think it’s going to be even worse next year.”</p>
      <p>The CBE cuts come as the University of Calgary is also facing budget challenges following the provincial budget. Officials said Monday the university will be <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/u-of-c-to-cut-250-positions-following-provincial-budget">eliminating 250 positions</a>, including 100 through retirements, vacancies and resignations. The other 150 jobs will be cut in two phases, with the first expected this month.</p>
