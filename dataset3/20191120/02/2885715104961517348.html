      <p>The internal policy of the Committee Against Sexual Harassment (CASH) of Panjab University is yet to be made public and disseminated amongst its students and staff members.</p>
      <p>The policy, which was allegedly formulated in 2016 under Professor Nishtha Jaiswal before the current Panjab University CASH committee was constituted, has not been published for PU students and employees to read.</p>
      <p>On November 3, PU CASH Convener Professor Ameer Sultana had told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Newsline that the policy had been sent to the registrar’s office when it was formulated, and it was the duty of the office to publish and disseminate the internal policy amongst Panjab University students and staff.</p>
      <p>Panjab University Registrar Karamjeet Singh said he was unaware of the existence of such a policy, but will check with his office to confirm its status. Two weeks since, Singh still does not know whether such a policy exists or not.</p>
      <p>After inquiring with clerks in his office who claimed there was no such document in their archive, Singh said, “There is some confusion in my office regarding the policy. I will get back to you with details.”</p>
      <p>“I am not sure that the UGC mandates that we have an internal policy,” said Professor Manvinder Kaur, chairman of Panjab University CASH. According to the UGC guidelines on Internal Complaints Committee for sexual harassment, employers need to “create and communicate a detailed policy” to everyone in the institution.</p>
      <p>“Even without the internal policy, we have tried to do sensitisation workshops. We just haven’t done one this year because the committee was supposed to be dismantled by October 30.</p>
      <p>But now we will plan some workshops maybe next semester,” said Kaur.</p>
