      <h1>Official Monero website is hacked to deliver currency-stealing malware</h1>
      <h2>GetMonero.org delivers Linux and Windows binaries that steal users' funds.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:19:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:19</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Goodin</a></address>
      <p>The official site for the Monero digital coin was hacked to deliver currency-stealing malware to users who were downloading wallet software, officials with GetMonero.org said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The supply-chain attack came to light on Monday when a site user reported that the <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/6151">cryptographic hash for a command-line interface wallet downloaded from the site didn't match the hash listed on the page</a>. Over the next several hours, users discovered that the miss-matching hash wasn't the result of an error. Instead, it was an attack designed to infect GetMonero users with malware. Site officials later confirmed that finding.</p>
      <p>"It's strongly recommended to anyone who downloaded the CLI wallet from this website between Monday 18th 2:30 AM UTC and 4:30 PM UTC, to check the hashes of their binaries," GetMonero officials <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/2019/11/19/warning-compromised-binaries.html">wrote</a>. "If they don't match the official ones, delete the files and download them again. <b>Do not run the compromised binaries for any reason.</b>"</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2019/11/monero-project-compromised.html">analysis of the malicious Linux binary</a> found that it added a few new functions to the legitimate one. One of the functions was called after a user opened or created a new wallet. It sent the wallet seed—which is the cryptographic secret used to access wallet funds—to a server located at node.hashmonero[.]com. The malware then sent wallet funds to the servers located at node.xmrsupport[.]co and 45.9.148[.]65.</p>
      <p>A malicious Windows version of the CLI wallet carried out an almost identical attack sequence.</p>
      <p>At least one person participating in a Reddit forum claimed to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/moneromanz/">lost digital coins after installing the malicious Linux binary</a>.</p>
      <p>"Roughly 9 hours after I ran the binary a single transaction drained my wallet of all $7000," the person wrote. "I downloaded the build yesterday around 6pm Pacific time."</p>
      <p>The user said at the time that it wasn't clear if the malware carried out other nefarious actions on the computer itself. The person made a copy of the malware <a href="https://anonfile.com/bbq8h9Bdn7/monero-wallet-cli">available for download</a> so that researchers can analyze the code. Under no circumstances should people run this binary on anything other than a test machine that has no access to cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
      <p>GetMonero's advisory didn't say the site was compromised or if the vulnerabilities that led to the hack had been fixed. Users should stay apprised of this breach in the coming days.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, people who want to verify the authenticity of their Monero CLI software can <a href="https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.html">check here for Windows</a> or <a href="https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-allos-advanced.html">here</a> for more advanced users of Windows, Linux, or macOS.</p>
      <p>The incident is a graphic reminder of why it's crucial to check summaries before installing software. The links in the paragraph above this one explain how to do that.</p>
