      <p>Demanding revision of salary and allowances besides better doctor-patient ratio, the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA) will go on a token strike on Wednesday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Emergency services will not be affected by the strike.</p>
      <p>A press release issued by the association stated that a revised package that had been submitted to the government by the Directorate of Medical Education should be implemented from January 1, 2016.</p>
      <p>The KGMCTA has demanded that the government should stop illegal postings and transfer of people in the name of new medical colleges. New medical colleges should be made functioning only after the infrastructure was put in place, the release said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Vidhu Kumar, the unit president at Government Medical College, Ernakulam, told <i>The Hindu</i> that medical colleges were woefully equipped to treat the patient burden because of lack of number of doctors as well as other facilities.</p>
      <p>Usually, posts were created only on the basis of the undergraduate requirement. The patient load was not taken into account, he said.</p>
