      <p>CAIRO, Nov 20 — Israel attacked Iranian and Syrian military targets in Syria today in what it said was retaliation for rockets fired toward Israel the day before, military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Avichay Adraee said.</p>
      <p>Syria's air defences were able to destroy most of the missiles fired by Israeli jets over the capital Damascus before they reached their targets, Syria's state news agency Sana said, quoting a military source.</p>
      <p>Israel's military said its missile defense system shot down four rockets fired from Syria toward Israel yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Warplanes raided dozens of military targets belonging to the Iranian Quds Force and the Syrian Army inside Syrian territory, including surface-to-air missiles, headquarters, weapons depots and military bases, in response to yesterday's rocket fire from Syria towards Israel,” Adraee said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The elite Quds Force is the overseas arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC).</p>
      <p>Sana said three were injured as a result of the Israeli counter-attack.</p>
      <p>Israel says it has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria against Iranian targets trying to establish a permanent military presence there and against advanced weapon shipments to Tehran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday's Iranian attack on Israeli territory by firing missiles.. is the best proof of Iran's real cause in Syria. The Iranian position poses a threat to Israel's security, stability in the region, and the Syrian regime,” Adraee said. — Reuters</p>
