      <h1>NZD bullish: BNZ ups Fonterra’s milk payment forecast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:21:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>The Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), in its latest report, raised the milk payment forecast for Fonterra to NZD 7.50 / kgms, in the wake of improving prices at the fortnight dairy auctions conducted by Fonterra.</p>
      <h3>Further Details:</h3>
      <p>“The NZ milk price outlook continues to improve. </p>
      <p>Dairy prices have been firm in 2019 and have pushed higher over recent auctions. </p>
      <p>GDT prices are heading toward the top of a trading range that has held them since 2014 and are now a chunky 26.4% higher than a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Overall, dairy market fundamentals continue to look healthy. Indeed, we would be forecasting a higher milk price if it were not for still elevated - if down from its peak - global economic uncertainty.”</p>
      <p>Despite the NZD-positive headline, the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/nzdusd">Kiwi</a> fails to benefit and trade in the red around 0.6420 amid US-China trade and political tensions.</p>
