      <p>West Seneca Town Board members made no changes to the tentative 2020 budget, before adopting it without comment Monday.</p>
      <p>The budget includes the reduction in salaries for supervisor, town clerk, highway superintendent – who will have new officeholders next year.</p>
      <p>Councilman Gene Hart, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for supervisor, said he agreed with Supervisor Sheila Meegan's proposal to reduce the salaries because "new employees shouldn't start at the top" of the salary scale.</p>
      <p>The supervisor’s pay will go from $72,500 to $65,000.</p>
      <p>The town clerk’s salary will decrease from $61,305 to $58,000 and the highway superintendent's salary will go from $93,196 to $80,000.</p>
      <p>The town's total assessment went down $1.8 million from the total included in the tentative budget proposed in September, according to Finance Director Megan Wnek.</p>
      <p>Spending in the general and highway fund is up 1.26%, while the tax levy is up 3.27%. The tax rate for the two funds will be $21.88 per $1,000 of assessed value, up 2.96%.</p>
      <p>The owner of a home assessed at $60,000 would pay less than $42 more a year.</p>
