      <h3>Attacks on sex workers</h3>
      <p>Four men have been arrested as part of investigations into attacks on sex workers.</p>
      <p>Seven assaults have taken place nationwide on sex workers since the middle of October.</p>
      <p>These arrests took place in West Dublin yesterday after three properties were searched as part of Operation Quest.</p>
      <p>Four men aged between 18 and 37 years of age are currently being held for questioning in relation to robberies and assaults on sex workers.</p>
      <p>A fifth man was arrested on foot of a bench warrant and is appearing before the Distinct Court today.</p>
      <p>The Operation was carried out by officers from the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.</p>
      <p>Along with units from Dublin Metropolitan South Central, Western and Northern Divisions, and Longford/Roscommon Divisions.</p>
      <p>It comes as seven attacks have taken place nationwide on sex workers since the middle of October.</p>
      <p>On each occasion an online appointment is made, but when the 'client' arrives the sex worker is assaulted and robbed by a number of men.</p>
      <p>Gardaí are appealing for people with information on these targeted attacks to contact them.</p>
      <p>In a statement, gardaí said: "An Garda Síochána is continuing to appeal to any sex worker who may have been subject to a similar attack to immediately report the incident. Anyone who comes forward will be treated confidentially with compassion and sensitivity.</p>
