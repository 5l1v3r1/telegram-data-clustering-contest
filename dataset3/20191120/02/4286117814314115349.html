      <p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah is expected to table a report in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday regarding the President's rule in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Amid the ongoing political impasse, Maharashtra was placed under the President's rule on November 12 after Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari recommended the same in a report submitted with the Home Ministry. The governor had said there was no possibility of a stable government in Maharashtra given the current situation between the political parties.</p>
      <p>The Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had then considered the report of the governor to the President that was submitted on November 12.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet recommended that President Ram Nath Kovind issues a proclamation under Article 356(1) of the Constitution imposing President's rule in Maharashtra and keep the state legislative assembly under suspended animation.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the union government will table this report on President's rule in Maharashtra.</p>

        <b>SUSPENSE CONTINUES OVER GOVT FORMATION</b>
      </p>
      <p>Senior leaders of NCP and Congress are expected to hold yet another meeting on Wednesday to discuss a possible tie-up with ideological opponent Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar visited Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi at her residence to discuss the political stalemate in Maharashtra and the conditions on which the two parties can extend support to Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar said that he had only discussed the political situation in Maharashtra with Sonia Gandhi and the two parties will hold further talks with other allies before taking a decision on government formation in the state.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said "it needs 100 births" to understand what Sharad Pawar says.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut also said that a Shiv Sena-led coalition government will be in power in Maharashtra by early-December. "You don't worry about Pawar and our alliance. Very soon, by early-December, a Shiv Sena-led alliance government will be in power in Maharashtra. It will be a stable government," Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PRESIDENT'S RULE IN MAHARASHTRA</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Maharashtra governor, in his report, had said that a situation had arisen in the state "in which it was impossible to form a stable government in the state".</p>
      <p>The governor also noted that he made attempts to explore the possibility of government formation by holding appropriate communications with all political parties that could have formed the government in alliance with other political parties. None of the parties managed to show enough strength to form the government.</p>
      <p>After BJP, the single largest party in Maharashtra assembly, declined to form the government with 105 MLAs and the Shiv Sena failed to get letters of support from the NCP and Congress, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari invited NCP to express " willingness" to stake claim to form government.</p>
      <p>However, the Governor, is his report, noted that NCP on November 12 conveyed to him that the party needs three more days to gather requisite support.</p>
      <p>The governor felt that as 15 days have passed already, he was not in a position to give more time to any party.</p>
      <p>President's rule has been imposed for six months and can be revoked anytime a party stakes claim and a situation emerges.</p>
