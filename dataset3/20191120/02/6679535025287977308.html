      <p>Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) on Tuesday signed an agreement with a joint venture (JV) company formed by Antea Nederland BV (Netherlands) and Unihorn to formulate and supervise the Kochi canal rejuvenation project.</p>
      <p>Alkesh Kumar, managing director of KMRL, asked the consortium to review and revise the existing detailed project report (DPR) before March next and to begin executing the work by September.</p>
      <p>The suggestions were made at the kick-off meeting of the consortium for the Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System Project at the KMRL office. There would now be a weekly review of the project’s progress.</p>
      <p>The consortium said it had set up a full-fledged team for the work. “There will be challenges and obstacles, there will also be a paradigm shift in the mindset of the people. The regeneration of canals is achievable, but for that, the support of all stakeholders is needed,” WH (Wim) Kloezen, project director international of Antea Group was quoted as saying in a release.</p>
      <p>“The agency has already started a preliminary study and will conduct site inspections and meetings with stakeholders in the coming days”, it said.</p>
