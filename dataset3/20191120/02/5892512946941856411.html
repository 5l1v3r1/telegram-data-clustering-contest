      <h1>Chuck Liddell doubles down on Mike Tyson street fight comments - ‘I’d take him down and he’d stay down’</h1>

      <p>A few days ago, Chuck Liddell stated that if he ever found himself in a street fight against Mike Tyson during their heydays, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/13/20963030/ufc-chuck-liddell-would-beat-mike-tyson-street-fight-punchers-chance-mma">it would be a battle he’d win</a>. But after catching some flack for his comments on social media, the former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Light Heavyweight champion took the time to defend his prediction.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://twitter.com/ChuckLiddell/status/1196159696530366464">Twitter</a>, “The Iceman” clarified his comments and doubled down by saying that “Iron Mike” would be unable to stop the takedown, which means he’d be like a fish out of water on the ground.</p>

      <p>“Look 1?I’m talking about when we were fighting 2) I’d take him down so he’d have one shot on my way in 3) I’m a big fan of mike and have no desire to fight him. But hypothetically speaking, when we were fighting, yes I would’ve beat him!”</p>
      <p>James Toney knows all about the effects a <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2010/8/28/1656280/did-james-toney-beat-randy-couture">takedown has on a professional boxer</a>.</p>
      <p>“He won’t get three minutes I’d shoot right away. He had no ground training or takedown defense training at all,” Chuck continued. “So he’d have to catch me on the way in or he’d never get off the ground period!”</p>
      <p>Still, Liddell made it very clear that he has no interest in fighting Tyson, or that he would be able to knock him out.</p>

      <p>“People are so funny. I like Mike and no we’re not getting in a street fight. I’m a huge fan of mike and I never said I’d ko him I said I’d win. I’d take him down it would make no sense to stand with him he’s a beast and yes devastating one punch power with both hands,” he added.</p>
      <p>In the end, Liddell was simply expressing his opinion, while doubters were eager to fire back with their own. Sadly, a fight between the two men never came to be, as Tyson was too busy knocking heads in the boxing world while Liddell was ruling the Octagon.</p>
      <p>And while a street fight is obviously very different from a sanctioned bout, there’s no telling what would’ve happened if these two ever squared up in a dark alley where anything goes.</p>
