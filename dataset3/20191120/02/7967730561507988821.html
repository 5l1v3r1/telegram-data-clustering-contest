      <h1>Lanning wants WBBL technology to improve after no-ball howler</h1>

      <p>Melbourne Stars captain Elyse Villani has called on Cricket Australia to address the use of technology in the Women's Big Bash League after her side was on the end of a howler in their loss to the Perth Scorchers at Junction Oval on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Scorchers completed a nine-wicket win over the bottom-of-the-ladder Stars, in doing so displacing the Melbourne Renegades – who lost earlier in the day to Brisbane Heat – in the WBBL top four.</p>

      <p>The Stars and Renegades meet in Ballarat on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Perth and Australian captain Meg Lanning all but conceded that her side had got the rub of the green when Stars opener Lizelle Lee – who had blasted a match-winning century when the sides met earlier in the season – was sent packing for 24 after being caught in the deep by Heather Graham off a ball from Samantha Betts which arrived at the batter at approximate shoulder height.</p>
      <p>The match was live-streamed on CA's website, but because it wasn't a Channel Seven broadcast match, third umpire technology wasn't available. Under tournament playing conditions, the decision could not be overturned and correctly called a no-ball.</p>

      <p>Villani said it was an issue worth looking at.</p>
      <p>"I think the replay probably says what I think of the decision," she said.</p>
      <p>"I think it's really hard, because in this competition some games are televised.</p>
      <p>"There's definitely room to bring that into the game with more TV cameras around, whether it's live-streamed or not. I think it's something to be looked at at the end of the season. We're always trying to make the competition the best domestic competition going around. I have no doubt they'll look at that at the end of the season."</p>
      <p>Lanning – who combined with fellow Perth opener Amy Jones to put on 147 runs for the first wicket and all but seal the match for their side – agreed that ideally the decision would have been reviewed.</p>
      <p>"I thought it potentially could have been a no-ball. I haven't seen a replay, but initially I thought it might have been over waist [height] but sometimes luck goes your way," Lanning said.</p>
      <p>"There's no doubt that would be ideal, if all games were able to be looked at like that. I think it makes it fairer. We get the right decisions more often than not. Unfortunately we don't have the technology to do that at the moment, but ideally if we could get that down the track I think everybody would be happy with that."</p>
      <p>In the first match of Wednesday's double-header at the Junction, the Heat fell to 5-98 in the 15th over but were catapulted to 5-153 from their 20 overs on the back of an unbeaten 63 from 29 balls from Jess Jonassen, who whacked six fours and three sixes.</p>

      <p>Opener Danni Wyatt blasted 40 from 18 balls, including six fours and a six, to get the Renegades off to a flyer.</p>

      <p>The Renegades were 2-73 after eight overs when Wyatt fell, but then lost regular wickets and were unable to repeat their thrilling win over the Sydney Sixers from Sunday after that match's hero Courtney Webb was run out for a diamond duck.</p>
      <p>The Renegades ultimately fell six runs short at 9-147 from their 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Renegades captain Jess Duffin – who is enjoying a strong season – said she remained open to making an international comeback for Australia. But the cross-code star said she wasn't sure what would happen if she was selected to play in the upcoming Twenty20 World Cup, which clashes with the AFLW season in which she plays for North Melbourne.</p>
      <p>"I don't think you can ever say no to playing for Australia. It's just whether or not it comes at the right time. I haven't really had those conversations," Duffin said.</p>
      <p>"It probably would be an issue for the Kangaroos."</p>
