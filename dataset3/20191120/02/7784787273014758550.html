      <h3>Two young Carlton midfielders are poised for breakout seasons after bursting out of the gates at the start of the pre-season.</h3>
      <p>Zac Fisher and Will Setterfield are two names who emerged on Tuesday, firstly via Blues co-captain Patrick Cripps at a press conference and then from the mouth of assistant coach Dale Amos on SEN.</p>
      <p>Fisher was linked to a few clubs during the trade period, where the Blues failed to land Sydney small forward Tom Papley or Gold Coast Suns midfielder-forward Jack Martin.</p>

      <p>The West Australian played a career-best 21 games in 2019 but could fight for midfield minutes with Martin, who is expected to find his way to Princes Park via the Pre-Season Draft next week.</p>
      <p>Setterfield arrived at Carlton this time last year still recovering from the anterior cruciate ligament tear that ruined his second season at Greater Western Sydney.</p>
      <p>Despite a limited maiden pre-season at Princes Park, the inside midfielder played 18 games, building momentum as the season progressed.</p>

      <p>“There’s probably two that have jumped out. Zac Fisher has come back in really good shape,” Amos told SEN on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“He looks really strong and in really good shape ready to start to elevate himself.</p>
      <p>“Will Setterfield off the back of joining us after having done his ACL looks like a different athlete to what he was 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>“Those guys have done all the work to put themselves in position to have a great pre-season. Typically that transfers into a big season.”</p>
      <p>Carlton unveiled their new Puma guernseys for 2020 in a warehouse in Brunswick East on Tuesday afternoon, after signing a ten-year deal with the German company earlier this year.</p>
