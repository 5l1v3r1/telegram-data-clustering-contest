      <h1>Google stops selling the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, out of stock at Google Store, Fi [Update]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:01:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Nearly a month after the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/21/pixel-4-shipping/">went on sale</a>, last year’s phone is now out of stock at both the Google Store and Fi. The Pixel 3 is no longer available to purchase in the United States, Canada, and other countries.</p>
      <p>In past years, Google would put the previous generation flagship on sale to get rid of excess inventory after the new phone launched. Given that the Pixel 3 was not a retail success, a deep $300 discount was instituted in <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/08/04/google-pixel-3-discount/">early August</a> and was extended in <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/29/300-pixel-3-discount/">late September</a> until November 23rd. Sundar Pichai <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/04/29/google-pixel-sales-drop/">during</a> Q1 2019 earnings this April reported lower year-over-year Pixel sales due to “recent pressures in the premium smartphone market.”</p>
      <p>As of this evening, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are “out of stock” on the <a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_3">Google Store</a>. Interestingly, the last models to sell out were the Not Pink Pixel 3 XL at $599 (64GB) and $699 (128GB). The Pixel 3 was priced at $499 for a pretty significant length of its retail lifespan, and overall a good deal.</p>
      <p><b>Update 11/20</b>: Stock for the 3 XL in Not Pink has oddly been replenished as of Wednesday morning PT.</p>

      <p>Google has yet to remove the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_3">product listing</a>, but that should occur soon. The 2018 flagships were powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 with 4GB of RAM and launched with Android 9 Pie. At the time, the 12.2MP camera was highly competitive against its peers, while there were two lenses up front for normal and wide-angle FoV. The smaller phone’s 5.5-inch display was paired with a 2,915 mAh battery, while the notch-laden 6.3-inch screen had a 3,430 mAh cell.</p>
      <p>The US and Canadian Google Stores have stopped selling the Pixel 3, with Google Fi also out of stock <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#pixel-3">this evening</a>.</p>
