      <p>Gil Hoffman explains why he doesn't believe Israel will be initiating an election for the third time in under a year. He reveals why he still thinks there is a chance for a unity government or a right-wing coalition to be formed by the December 11 deadline or a minority government backed by Arab legislators by Wednesday night's deadline. He goes into the different loopholes that remain that can help prevent another election.</p>
      <p>Looking back on his tour around America and Canada, Gil explains why the people he met gave him hope for the future of the US-Israel relationship.</p>
