      <p>Give the Kitchener Rangers credit.</p>
      <p>Coming in against the hottest team and best defense in the OHL, it was going to be an uphill battle.</p>
      <p>But with the game tied at one, the Guelph Storm scored a backbreaker with a second left in the second period and put up three more in the final frame to take down the Blueshirts 5-1 Tuesday night at The Aud.</p>
      <p>Riley Damiani tallied a power play marker off a beauty of a backhand feed from Jonathan Yantsis in the second, extending Damiani's point streak to six games.</p>
      <p>But that's all they could get by Nico Daws, who made 30 saves to claim the victory.</p>
      <p>Pavel Gogolev had a three-point night, putting him up to 19 points in his last 10 games.</p>
      <p>Cam Hillis had a goal and an assist, while Keegan Stevenson, Josh Wainman and Cedric Ralph scored the others for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Lucas Pfeil stopped 20 shots in the loss.</p>
      <p>Kitchener has now lost eight of their last 10 games, and things don't get any easier with London paying a visit to Kitchener Friday night.</p>
      <p>Pregame on 570 NEWS is 7:00 p.m.</p>
