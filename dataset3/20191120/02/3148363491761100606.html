      <h1>Angel Dad After Son's Murder: Sanctuary Counties 'Need to Change'</h1>
      <h2>An Angel Dad whose son was allegedly murdered by two illegal alien members of the MS-13 gang says sanctuary counties “need to change” their policies to protect residents.</h2>

      <p>As Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/18/sanctuary-county-two-illegal-ms-13-gang-members-accused-of-hacking-to-death-16-year-old-boy/">reported</a> last month, Rudy Osvaldo Garcia-Hernandez, a 28-year-old illegal alien, and Carlos Orlando Iraheta-Vega, a 20-year-old illegal alien, have each been charged with murdering 16-year-old Juan Carlos Con Guzman in King County, Washington.</p>
      <p>King County is one of the most expansive sanctuary counties in the nation. In this case, Garcia-Hernandez and Iraheta-Vega were previously in local custody but were released to the public against the wishes of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.</p>
      <p>Guzman’s immigrant father Juan Carlos Con Chiquin <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/father-of-murdered-teen-speaks-out-on-sanctuary-policies-for-immigrants">told</a> KOMO News that if King County had turned the two illegal aliens over to ICE agents, his son may still be alive.</p>
      <p>“They need to change a little bit … in these circumstances, they [need to] work more hard and together,” Chiquin said of sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

      <p>Today, Chiquin said his son’s memorial sits at the front of his home, something that he described as breaking his heart each time he walks through the front door.</p>
      <p>“They take all my love. They broke my heart. Broke everything,” Chiquin said.</p>
      <p>Garcia-Hernandez and Iraheta-Vega are reported members of the MS-13 gang. The violent street gang, based out of El Salvador, has built a growing army of El Salvadoran illegal and legal immigrants in the U.S.</p>
      <p>According to prosecutors, Guzman was lured by the two illegal aliens into a remote location for a fight. When the victim arrived, prosecutors said Garcia-Hernandez and Iraheta-Vega beat the 16-year-old boy with a baseball bat and then tortured him by hacking off his limbs with a machete and leaving his dead body in a nearby river.</p>
      <p>The illegal aliens are each being held in King County Jail on a $3 million bond.</p>
      <p>As Breitbart News has chronicled, King County has routinely shielded criminal illegal aliens from arrest and deportation. In a recent case, an illegal alien rapist was <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/06/20/sanctuary-city-illegal-alien-wanted-attacking-his-rape-victim-after-being-released/">released</a> from prison and allegedly hunted down his victim — a disabled woman — and attacked her. The illegal alien is now wanted for the attack and is believed to have fled to Mexico.</p>
