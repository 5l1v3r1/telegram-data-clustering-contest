      <h2>All-Ireland electricity demand to hit 44 terawatt hours by 2022, report says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:07:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/barry-o-halloran-7.1010658" target="_blank">Barry O'Halloran</a></address>
      <p>Electricity prices could rise as demand from data centres grows and the Republic shifts from fuels such as coal and peat to renewables, analysts say.</p>
      <p>Wind energy now supplies about a third of the Republic’s electricity needs but generators, including State-owned <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=ESB">ESB</a>, also burn “carbon-intensive” fuels such as coal and peat, alongside natural gas, to provide power.</p>
      <p>Credit ratings agency Moodys says the ongoing reliance on coal and peat, which provided 19 per cent of electricity last year, makes <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> one of Europe’s dirtiest power producers.</p>
      <p>The agency estimates in a report published on Tuesday that wholesale electricity prices could hit €60 a megawatt hour (MWh) by 2022 as the Republic shuts coal and peat plants while energy demand grows.</p>
      <p>Analysts Graham W Taylor, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Matthew+Brown">Matthew Brown</a> and Neil Griffiths-Lambeth say the increasing number of mainly multinational-owned data centres, whose construction the Government encourages, will drive much of the demand.</p>
      <p>They calculate that total all-Ireland electricity demand will hit 44 terawatt hours, enough to power more than 40 million homes, by 2022, a 13 per cent increase from 2018.</p>
      <h3>Data centres</h3>
      <p>“A significant driver of demand growth is from data centres, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” the trio says.</p>
      <p>They note that national electricity grid manager, EirGrid, estimates that demand from data centres will treble over the 10 years to 2028, accounting for 29 percent of total consumption.</p>
      <p>Moody’s has increased its estimate of likely wholesale prices through to 2022 by €5 a MWh to €55-€60 a MWh. Yesterday’s wholesale price was about €57 a MWh, according to EirGrid.</p>
      <p>Wholesale prices determine what electricity suppliers charge homes and businesses for power.</p>
      <p>The ESB-owned Electric Ireland remains the biggest player in the market, with 48 per cent, followed by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Bord+G%C3%A1is">Bord Gáis</a> Energy at 19 per cent, SSE <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Airtricity">Airtricity</a> on 13 per cent and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Energia">Energia</a> on 9 per cent.</p>
      <p>Moody’s, which assesses the ESB’s and Energia’s ability to repay their debts, indicates that increased demand and increased prices will benefit both.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mr+Taylor">Mr Taylor</a> notes that Energia’s plans to invest in its business, flagged this summer, pose some risk to that group.</p>
      <p>The credit ratings agency predicts that older power plants will close as emissions standards tighten.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor, Mr Brown and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mr+Griffiths">Mr Griffiths</a> point out that the ESB has already pledged to close West Offaly and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Lough+Ree">Lough Ree</a> peat-fired plants by the end of 2020.</p>
      <h3>Moneypoint</h3>
      <p>They add that the State company has not formally said that it will close Moneypoint, the 885MW coal-burning electricity plant on the Shannon estuary, which is the Republic’s biggest individual generator.</p>
      <p>However, the analysts note that regulators assume Moneypoint will shut by 2025, following the Government’s commitment to phase out coal-fired electricity generation by that year.</p>
      <p>They believe that electricity from new wind farms and an extra natural gas-powered generator, which should begin operating by 2025, will replace the coal and peat plants.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Moodys says that Ireland has been importing electricity from Britain, via two lines running underneath the Irish Sea, this year.</p>
      <p>However, they expect this to reverse in coming years, as wholesale prices here will be slightly lower than those in Britain.</p>
