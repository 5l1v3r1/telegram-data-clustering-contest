      <p>An autistic teen was found in a pool of blood after he was allegedly beaten and knocked unconscious by several students at a Kentucky high school last Thursday, according to local reports.</p>
      <p>Court records say three students followed the victim into a bathroom at Louisville’s Iroquois High School while one stood watch at the door.</p>
      <p>The court records say the students “beat the victim with their hands and feet until he was knocked unconscious.”</p>
      <p>Another student later found the victim lying on the floor in a pool of blood, <a href="https://www.wave3.com/2019/11/16/iroquois-high-school-student-arrested-alleged-involvement-beating-teen-with-autism/">Louisville’s WAVE 3 reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Emergency responders transferred the victim to an area hospital where he underwent surgery to repair his fractured jaw which had several teeth knocked loose, the sheriff’s deputy said.</p>
      <p>Damon Simmons, 18, has been arrested in connection with the alleged beating, the <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/local/crime/article237441354.html#storylink=mainstage">Lexington Herald-Leader reported</a>. He has been charged with second-degree assault and second-degree criminal mischief. Simmons has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
      <p>Court records indicate he is being held at the Louisville Metro Department of Correction on $25,000 bond.</p>
      <p>The other alleged perpetrators, who are juveniles, are facing first-degree wanton endangerment, first-degree unlawful imprisonment, and second-degree assault – all of which are felonies, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
