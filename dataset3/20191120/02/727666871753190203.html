      <p>The Feds say rapper Dark Lo wrote a threatening letter to a witness testifying against Philly rapper AR-AB, who was just convicted of running a drug empire.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> More details have come forth surrounding the arrest of Philly rapper Dark Lo, who was accused of threatening a federal witness during AR-AB's drug trial.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/rapper-ar-ab-convicted-of-running-a-drug-empire-in-philadelphia-facing-life-pDt9t1padkyYKKjy62iuOA/">Earlier today (November 19th), AR-AB was convicted of using his Original Block Hustlaz imprint to pump lethal quantities of cocaine, crack, meth and heroin throughout Philadelphia.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The rapper and three of his associates are facing life in prison when they are sentenced for conspiracy to distribute drugs.</p>

        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/rapper-dark-lo-charged-with-tampering-with-a-witness-over-ar-ab-drug-trial-fq9XVTiJdEGltWIFuBs2kQ/">O.B.H. rapper Dark Lo unexpectedly became tangled up in the case, after he was busted last week for threatening a witness who testified against AR-AB and his associates.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Reps for Dark Lo said the witness was not comfortable with him in the courtroom, but the Feds say the rapper's threat was much greater than his presence during a portion of the trial.</p>
      <p>The Feds claim Dark Lo, real name Charles Salley, wrote a threatening letter to a witness under one of his rap aliases â€œRon Harvey."</p>
      <p>Dark Lo dropped an entire mixtape titled "Ron Harvey Jr.," which was named after the infamous co-founder of the Philadelphia Black Mafia.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/218311/2003/11/03/book-recalls-how-brutal-black-mafia-terrorized-philly-streets">The real Ron Harvey was sentenced to seven life sentences for his role in the murder of seven people inside of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's townhouse in Washington D.C. in 1973.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The Feds say Dark Lo's letter under the "Ron Harvey" alias threatened to harm the witness for snitching on his O.B.H. associates.</p>
      <p>On November 13, 2019, United States Magistrate Judge Lynne A. Sitarski ordered Dark Lo be held in custody until his trial.</p>
      <p>If Dark Lo is convicted, he is facing up to 20 years in prison for witness tampering.</p>
