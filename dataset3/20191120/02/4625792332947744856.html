      <h1>ICE: Man arrested for manslaughter fled to Mexico after Portland jail did not honor hold request</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:04:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:04</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Giaritelli</a></address>
      <p>A Mexican man who fled south of the United States border to avoid being tried on manslaughter charges was released by police in Portland, Oregon, despite federal immigration officers asking he be held.</p>
      <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a Tuesday statement that the Washington County Sheriff’s Department ignored its August request to hold Alejandro Maldonado-Hernandez until its officers could show up and take him into federal custody, according to the agency. As a result, ICE said the man was released from the local jail and able to flee the country without going on trial for felony and misdemeanor charges in the July traffic-related death of a local woman.</p>

      <p>“The decision to rebuff immigration detainers and not to hold dangerous individuals until ICE arrives to pick them up, is a costly one,” Nathalie Asher, Seattle field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/criminal-alien-wanted-killing-motorist-flees-after-local-law-enforcement-ignores">statement</a> Tuesday. “The decision to continue to site misguided sanctuary laws that allow dangerous criminals back on the streets, and many times the opportunity to flee prosecution, is irresponsible and jeopardizes public safety.”</p>
      <p>On July 12, 20-year-old Maldonado-Hernandez was arrested in the Portland suburb of West Beaverton and booked into jail on charges of felony manslaughter in the second degree, felony assault in the third degree, and misdemeanor reckless driving after crashing his Chrysler 300 into a Ford Fusion, the police news <a href="https://flashalert.net/id/wcso/126060">release</a> states. Police determined Maldonado-Hernandez had been street racing a Subaru when he struck the Ford.</p>
      <p>Janace Ator, one of the passengers in the Subaru, was declared dead at the scene. Her husband, Patrick Ator, was seriously injured. The suspect was taken to the hospital for minor injuries, then was released and arrested.</p>

      <p>ICE issued a detainer, which is a formal request that the local jail notify ICE before a person believed to be illegally present in the U.S. be held in jail 48 hours past the release date so they can be transferred to a federal immigration facility. If he had been transferred to ICE, he would have gone through immigration proceedings where a federal judge would decide whether to deport him to Mexico, and he would be present for the Portland trial. Cities and counties that do not cooperate with ICE are referred to as “sanctuary” places.</p>
      <p>He was released by the Washington County jail on Aug. 8. Asher said the man’s release was a “real slap in the face” to the victims and family members.</p>
      <p>Washington Sheriff’s Office <a href="https://flashalert.net/id/wcso/127428">announced</a> in September it had learned “Maldonado-Hernandez fled to Mexico to avoid prosecution, with the assistance of three people.” The three involved were arrested in August for hindering his prosecution. ICE has since issued a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/most-wanted/maldonado-hernandez-alejandro">wanted flyer</a> for Maldonado-Hernandez and believes he is in Mexico.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Subaru, 20-year-old Bailey Reeves of Beaverton, was arrested on first-degree manslaughter, second-degree assault, two counts of injury hit-and-run, and reckless driving charges, the police said in a <a href="https://flashalert.net/id/wcso/127428">statement</a>. She was indicted by a grand jury on Sept. 6 and is held on $250,000 bail.</p>
