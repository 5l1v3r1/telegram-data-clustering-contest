      <p>A manhunt is underway after a father and son were carjacked at gunpoint in Stapylton in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p>Around 1.30am, the 43-year-old man and his 15-year-old son were sitting in his black VE Holden Commodore Clubsport sedan with no registration plates on Henry Hester Drive.</p>
      <p>Police say a dark blue vehicle then drove towards the pair with no headlights on, before three men exited the car.</p>
      <p>“One of the males lifted his shirt and displayed what appeared to be a firearm tucked into his belt,” police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The armed male has demanded the father and son exit the Commodore, before he got into the driver’s seat and drove away.”</p>
      <p>The other two men returned to the dark-blue vehicle and also sped off.</p>
      <p>Thankfully no one was injured during the robbery.</p>
      <p>Investigations are continuing.</p>
