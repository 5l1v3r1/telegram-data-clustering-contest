      <p>THE Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) Worldwide on Tuesday urged Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson to support the governor-elect, Chief David Lyon.</p>
      <p>It will be in the interest of the Ijaw Nation to rally behind Lyon, the group said.</p>
      <p>IYC, in a statement by its President, Eric Omare, appealed to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Senator Douye Diri, to accept defeat and congratulate the winner.</p>
      <p>The group said: “We congratulate Chief Lyon for coming out victorious in the keenly contested election. Your victory is a manifestation of the wishes of the people of Bayelsa State and by extension, the Ijaw nation.</p>
      <p>“We call on other contestants, who lost out in the contest, to join hands with the governor-elect in the interest of the Ijaw nation.</p>
      <p>“We also call on the outgoing governor, Seriake Dickson, who is a strong advocate of the Ijaw interest, to support the governor-elect in the interest of the Ijaw nation.”</p>
      <p>IYC said Lyon, a son of the Ijaw nation, deserves the people’s support to succeed.</p>
      <p>The group added: “The people of Bayelsa have spoken through their votes and they have spoken loud and clear.</p>
      <p>“Having come out successful in a keenly contested election, the IYC calls on the governor-elect to use his position to unite the Ijaw nation, from Akwa Ibom State to Ondo State, for a common purpose, just as the Late Governor-General of the Ijaw nation Chief D. S. P. Alamieyesiegha, did.</p>
      <p>“The governor-elect must see himself as a leader of all Ijaw people with a pan-Ijaw mandate irrespective of party affiliation.</p>
      <p>“Chief Lyon must learn from the experience of the last years where the Ijaws have been so polarised, including our struggle platforms: the Ijaw National Congress (INC) and the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) worldwide.</p>
      <p>“It is our strong belief that the Ijaw nation can rise again with the incoming governor of Bayelsa State providing the right leadership. Let the Ijaw Nation rise again.”</p>

      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) said Lyon’s victory shows that the Southsouth was gradually accepting the party.</p>
      <p>National Organising Secretary, Emma Ibediro, told The Nation in Abuja added that the re-election of Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello indicated that party had come to stay in the Northcentral.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is not easy to beat an incumbent in a state like Bayelsa that has been under the PDP for the past 20 years.</p>
      <p>“But, when you present a good man as a candidate, a man who is at home with his people, there’s no way people can forsake such a man, especially when they are confronted with a very incompetent government that has been ruling the state for the past eight years.</p>
      <p>“Bayelsa is a small state, one of those with the smallest number of local government areas and one of the states with a huge income from the Federal Government, due to its location.</p>
      <p>“But, upon a visit to Yenagoa, you cannot see the effect of the large resources that go into Bayelsa. The victory, for Bayelsa people, is liberation.</p>
      <p>“In Kogi, I want to thank the people for reconfirming their choice for the APC. A lot of things were said about Bello. But, as we all can see, these were propaganda from outside the state, the actual owners of Kogi have said who they want.</p>
      <p>“It’s also another opportunity for him to correct the wrongs, if any, which people accused him of.</p>
      <p>“I want to congratulate both governors-elect on the very important victories for their states and for our party.</p>
      <p>“I hope that by their actions, they will renew the trust Nigerians are beginning to have in the progressive government of President Muhammadu Buhari.”</p>
