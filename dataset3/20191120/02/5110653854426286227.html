      <p>NHL general managers left recent meetings in Toronto in agreement to <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-offisdei-rule-to-be-discussed-at-gm-meetings-in-march/c-311506416">further discuss the league's current offside rule</a> at their next meetingin March 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-offisdei-rule-to-be-discussed-at-gm-meetings-in-march/c-311506416">According to NHL.com</a>, senior executive vice president of hockey operationsColin Campbellsaid that GMs will discuss possibly modifying the league's definition of offside— which could allow players to be considered onside if their skate even if it is not on the ice and insteadhovers above the blueline.</p>
      <p>Video review on goals scored during offsideplays has frustrated players, teams and fans <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/53xk9z/in-defense-of-the-nhl-using-replay-to-change-offside-calls">since it was first introduced in 2014</a>. This remains the case even after the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/nhl-2019-20-what-rules-have-changed-for-the-upcoming-season/19sbw9crfkgq11gul3269txtg4">rule was changed this year</a> so that teams would incur a minor penalty for a failed coach's challenge for an offsideplay, but teams have still taken issues with some goal reversals.</p>

      <p>The league's GMs reportedly looked at one specific review that took away a goal from the Boston Bruins in their Nov. 5 loss to the Montreal Canadiens.</p>

      <p>Bruins forward Charlie Coyle kicked the puck into the offensive zone as he glided over the blue line and scored what would have been the go-ahead-goal seconds later, but his zone entry was ruled offsideafter video review. The Bruins ultimately lost that game 5-4, in part because Coyle was not considered in possession of the puck in that moment.</p>
      <p>"I think we're always trying to be progressive and reward offense," Campbell told <a href="http://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-offisdei-rule-to-be-discussed-at-gm-meetings-in-march/c-311506416">NHL.com</a>. "I think our players are much more talented than the players of the past. I can say that because I was one. But these players, the talent they have now, I think we have to take that into consideration with what they can do with the puck on those possessions and control plays on the blue line."</p>
      <p>According to the league, adding a minor penalty for all failed coaches'challenges this season has led to a 32 percent decrease in the number of challenges(40 so far in 2019-20) from last season (59). The NHL reports thesuccess rate of those challenges currently sits at 58 percent — a rise from 32 percent last season.</p>
      <p>League officials also addressed the rule dictating whenon-ice officials may stop play if an injured player cannot continue to play while an opposing team has the puck. This rule came under firewhen Colorado Avalanche forward <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/nhl-players-critical-of-avalanche-canucks-officials-for-handling-of-matt-calvert-injury/3m08vj48816o17go7335c5f2b">Matt Calvert was hit in the head</a> with a puck during a Nov. 16 game against the Vancouver Canucks — and the Canucks scored while Calvert laid in distress on the ice.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Director of officiating Stephen Walkom told reporters that the Calvert incident was an "unfortunate situation in that game" and reaffirmed that officials may stop play at any point if it is obvious there is a serious injury.</p>
      <p>"What we direct officials to do is, when there's a serious injury and any of them sees it, we want them to kill the play, especially when it's in the head or the face," Walkom told <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/28116931/nhl-amend-rule-controversy-involving-matt-calvert-injury">ESPN's Greg Wyshynski</a>. "When a player is seriously injured on the ice, we don't want a lot of time going by before we kill the play. It seemed like an eternity in that game, even though it was probably closer to four or five seconds. The puck was moving around. The player attempted to get up. Of course, we would have liked to blow the play down earlier, especially when it resulted in an injury."</p>
      <p>Thirteen seconds passed in between Calvert's initial injury and when play eventually stopped after a Canucks goal, but Walkom told Wyshynski that none of the on-ice officials that night "had a real sightline" on it.</p>
