      <p>A 20-year-old student at SUNY New Paltz slipped off a cliff and plummeted 150 feet to her death while hiking with friends, police and school officials said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Katherine Vollmer and some her classmates at the university in upstate New York went exploring old cement caves and trails in Hasbrouck Park Monday evening — and got lost, eventually finding themselves at the edge of a cliff, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KingstonPD/photos/a.208782982514118/2716391081753283/?type=3&amp;theater">authorities said</a>.</p>
      <p>The “unsanctioned hiking group” began walking along the precipice in the hopes of returning to their vehicles.</p>
      <p>At around 9:50 p.m., the young woman lost her footing and fell, according to the Kingston Police Department.</p>
      <p>The area she dropped down to was “only accessible by an experienced rope team,” police said.</p>
      <p>“Due to the lack of light and poor weather conditions it was decided that the recovery of the student would have to wait until daylight,” cops said.</p>

      <p>When a rescue team found Vollmer Tuesday morning, it was determined she had “suffered severe trauma from the fall” and was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>New Paltz President Donald Christian, who identified the student in a statement Tuesday, said she was a visual arts major who had transferred to the school from Monroe Community College this fall, <a href="https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/police-blotter/suny-new-paltz-student-dies-in--foot-fall-from/article_35eda42c-0aed-11ea-ad3a-bb9756ab5403.html">according to the Daily Freeman</a>.</p>
      <p>“We extend our deepest sympathy to Katherine’s family and friends and to the students, faculty and staff who knew her,” Christian said.</p>
      <p>The Rochester native appeared to be an avid hiker, according to her social media accounts.</p>
      <p>A picture she posted to Facebook in September shows her beaming atop a boulder in the Adirondacks’ Cascade and Porter Mountains.</p>
      <p>In her Twitter profile photo, she leans against a warning sign on a mountain in what appears to be Iceland.</p>
