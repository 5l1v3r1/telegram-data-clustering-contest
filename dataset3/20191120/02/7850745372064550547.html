      <h1>How revolutions continue even after internet, phones are cut off</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:11:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:11</time> by <a rel="author">Yusuf Serunukuma</a></address>
      <p>My friend, theorist Slavoj Žižek once pronounced activists Julian Assange, Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning as ‘our new heroes.’ </p>
      <p>By calling them ‘our new heroes,’ Žižek sought to salute their fearlessness in taking on the challenge to expose the often-hidden crimes of power and capitalists.  Indeed, with their work – especially through the flagship project, WikiLeaks – governments have collapsed.</p>
      <p>Even the very rich have had their deceptive images soiled. Companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and others have had their fake benevolence exposed. Their close love affair with power and American hegemony is out in the open.</p>
      <p>In When Google Met Wikileaks, Juliane Assange reproduces a transcript of a long conversation he had with Google’s Eric Schmidt while under house arrest in Norfolk, England in a 2011 conversation (before moving into the Ecuadorian embassy). </p>
      <p>Somewhere in the conversation, Schmidt asks Assange about “mobile phones being empowered to change society,” what Assange had called “building phone-to-phone encryption” which is, basically, continuing to communicate even after the Internet or mobile phone service is cut off. Assange’s long answer is sweet cuisine for activists (pp 111-113).</p>
      <p>“When we were dealing with Egypt”, he started, “we saw Mubarak government cut off the internet, but there was one ISP [Internet Service Provider] still connected. Quite a few of us were involved in keeping it open. It had maybe six percent of the market. The Mubarak government also cut off the mobile phone system…People with mobile phones have a device that can communicate in a radio spectrum.  In a city there is high density of mobile phones. There is always a path between one person and another person; that is, there is always continuous paths of mobile phones, each one of which can, in theory, hear the radio of the other.”</p>
      <p>Assange continued that, “the way most GSM phones and other phones are being constructed is that they receive on a different frequency to that one on which they transmit, and that means they cannot form peer-to-peer network. They have to go through base stations. But we are seeing now that mobile phones are becoming more flexible in terms of base station programming.</p>
      <p>They need to become more flexible because they are sold in different markets where different frequencies are used and there are different forms of wireless output. Even when mobile phones are not sufficiently flexible, we are seeing that WiMAX might be coming along, which will give them greater radius for two-way communication. But also it is getting very cheap to make your own base station. </p>
      <p>There is a software now that will run a base station for you. So, you can throw these up and pretty quickly make your own networks using conventional mobile phones.  In fact, this is what is done to cheaply spy on mobile phones; you set up fake base stations. There are vans now that you can buy in bulk on the commercial spy market. You set up a van and intercept mobile phone calls.</p>
      <p>“During revolutionary periods, the people involved in the revolution need to be able to communicate in order to plan quickly, and they need to be able to pass around information about what is happening in the environment so that they can dynamically adapt to it and produce the next strategy.</p>
      <p>If only the security services are able to communicate, and the government turns the mobile phone system off, the security services have a tremendous advantage. [But] If you have a system where individuals are able to communicate securely and robustly despite what the security services are doing, then the security services will have to give more ground. It is not that the government is necessarily going to be overthrown but, rather, they have to make more concessions.</p>
      <p>Voice may be harder, Assange continued after Schmidt’s prompting. But data usage is possible. It is a peer-to-peer UDP [User Datagram Protocol] encrypted flood network. The UDP, Assange explained, “permits you to put lots of cover traffic in, because you can send random data to random internet hosts… the random internet host does not have to respond…and you can [then] do hole-punching through firewalls.”</p>
      <p>Although the explanation above comes off as too technical and complex, Assange explained that “normal at-home people can use this, and they do not need a server. It is very light bandwidth and can be put on a mobile phone as well. Concluding this segment, Assange noted that this protocol was not lots of voice, but best for small chat rooms… “of thirty to a hundred people – that is what revolutionary movements need.”</p>
