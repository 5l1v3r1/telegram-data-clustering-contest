      <p>Police have been cleared of using excessive force against a hostage-taker shot dead during a siege in Perth.</p>
      <p>Officers fired 13 shots in nine seconds, with up to 11 bullets hitting 38-year- old meth user Brendan John Lindsay as he held Sheila Tran captive at knifepoint outside a Carlisle deli in November 2014.</p>

      <p>The father-of-one and his partner had been together for about 20 years, planned to have another child and were renovating their home.</p>
      <p>But they had argued about his relapses into drug use, which she did not approve of, and which made him aggressive, erratic and sometimes psychotic.</p>
      <p>Lindsay’s father, John Lindsay, had accompanied his son to drug rehabilitation the day before he died and witnessed the shooting.</p>
      <p>He’d noticed his son was becoming increasingly agitated and took him to the lunch bar in a bid to distract him, but became fearful for his safety on the drive there.</p>

      <p>Police dog handler Tom Gyrta drove past and spotted Mr Lindsay subtly signal for help, so turned back to assist.</p>
      <p>Spotting his father’s gesture and seeing the police car, Lindsay became angered and ran into the lunch bar, where he grabbed a kitchen knife and initially pointed it towards his own throat.</p>
      <p>Constable Gyrta drew his Taser and ordered Lindsay to drop the knife but he refused, grabbing Ms Tran and holding the knife towards her throat while yelling.</p>
      <p>“After the deceased took the hostage, Constable Gyrta considered his firearm to be his only real option, because in his view a non-lethal use of force, if it failed, would have significantly escalated the situation,” state coroner Ros Fogliani said in her findings on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The officer repeatedly attempted to negotiate and de-escalate the siege as back up arrived, but Lindsay demanded a helicopter and pressed the knife against the hostage, raising it and shouting he would kill her.</p>
      <p>Shots were fired after he stabbed Ms Tran twice in the shoulder.</p>
      <p>She also suffered gunshot wounds to her shoulder and leg, and underwent surgery for her injuries.</p>
      <p>“Within that volatile and dangerous period there were minimal opportunities for police to de-escalate the situation,” Ms Fogliani said.</p>
      <p>“He (Constable Gyrta) did try to negotiate with the deceased under very challenging circumstances.”</p>
