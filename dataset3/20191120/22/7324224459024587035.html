      <h2>Walsall manager Darrell Clarke praised his players for ‘finding a way to win’ when the Saddlers defeated non-league Darlington in an FA Cup first round replay.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:36:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The Quakers dominated the chances in the opening 45 minutes, often getting a 3,000 strong crowd off their feet.</p>
      <p>But after some resolute defending, Walsall finally got the breakthrough just before the 70th minute.</p>
      <p>Striker Caolan Lavery netted his fifth of the season when he met Rory Holden’s corner with a powerful header.</p>
      <p>The Saddlers then controlled the remainder of the game as kept hold of their lead.</p>
      <p>And Clarke was pleased that his players are starting to find different ways to win games.</p>
      <p>“Let’s be honest, it wasn’t a classic,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I thought Darlington are a credit to themselves over the two games.</p>
      <p>“Really hard fought, never gave in.</p>
      <p>“I thought first half they probably edged it, I wasn’t too happy with the first half.</p>
      <p>“But second half I thought we were in control, albeit while not creating too many opportunities.</p>
      <p>“A well worked set piece and we saw the game out comfortably in the end.</p>
      <p>“It’s about winning football games.</p>
      <p>“I called the players mentally soft in our bad run in October but now we’ve won three games on the spin and shown a different side to us.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully the boys are learning how to win football matches, there’s loads of different ways you can win games.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you have to roll your sleeves up and try and quieten down a hostile crowd that got right behind the club from minute dot.</p>
      <p>“We’ve come here, pitch is bobbly, their players are giving everything and raising that 10, 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>“But my lads found out a way to win, which I’ve been asking of them on a consistent basis.</p>
      <p>“I’ll rewind to exactly what I said in September when we won four on the spin, we’re a million miles away from where I want to get us as a football club.</p>
      <p>“But what I will say is, if players can come out of the October spell, they’ll come out as better players.”</p>
      <p>The Saddlers now host high-flying Oxford United in the second round of the competition.</p>
      <p>The League One side sit seventh in the division and they will travel to the Black Country for the tie at the end of the month.</p>
