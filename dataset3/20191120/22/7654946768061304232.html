      <h1>Automated camera enforcement coming to 14th Street busway</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:44:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author">Elizabeth Rosner and David Meyer</a></address>
      <p>Automated enforcement cameras are coming to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/02/the-14th-street-car-ban-begins-tomorrow-heres-what-you-should-know/">14th Street busway</a>, the MTA and city announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Cameras mounted to the front of M14 buses will start flagging drivers who are illegally parking, loading or idling on 14th Street busway beginning Thursday.</p>
      <p>Drivers busted using the bus lanes will be issued warnings until Jan. 20, when the fines kick in.</p>
      <p>The Department of Transportation largely banned cars on the crosstown thoroughfare between Third and Eighth avenues beginning in October, in a bid to speed up one of the nation’s slowest bus routes.</p>
      <p>Drivers are still allowed to use the street between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.</p>
      <p>Officials say the MTA plans to have the parking scofflaw cameras installed on 128 city buses before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The cameras already mounted on buses that run the B44 and M15 routes have flagged 20,000 bus-lane blockers over the last month, MTA stats show.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the city Department of Transportation’s fixed-location cameras, which <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/17/mtas-bus-cameras-catch-1-5k-illegally-parked-cars-in-10-days/">have been giving warnings</a> since the car ban began Oct. 2, will start dolling out financial penalties on Dec. 2.</p>
      <p>Fines start at $50 and increase by $50 for each additional offense, with $250 being the maximum penalty within a 12-month period.</p>
      <p>Bus travel times on 14th Street are 38% faster than they were a year ago, according to MTA data. Ridership is up big time, too, jumping 21% since the busway’s launch last month.</p>
      <p>“In six weeks of the busway, 14th Street has already seen a dramatic transformation with faster buses and higher ridership on the M14 SBS,” DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said in a statement.</p>
      <p>But one M14 bus rider expressed skepticism.</p>
      <p>“The bus lanes are working well, it doesn’t take much time, and I don’t have to wait a long time for the bus to come,” Andrea Alexander, 33, of the Lower East Side told The Post. “[But] there’s always traffic, especially during rush hour. It’s Manhattan, bus lanes won’t fix congestion.”</p>
