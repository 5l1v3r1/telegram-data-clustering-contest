      <h1>Putin says the Ukraine scandal has distracted the U.S. from Russian election meddling: 'Thank God'</h1>

      <p>At least one person is happy about everything that's going on in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>As everything that went down between President Trump and Ukraine comes to the surface, Russian President Vladimir Putin is literally saying "thank God" that eyes aren't on him anymore. "No one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore," he said at a Wednesday economic forum in Moscow, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/thank-god-putin-thrilled-u-s-political-battles-over-ukraine-n1087126">per NBC News</a>. "Now they're accusing Ukraine."</p>
      <p>Intelligence officials have concluded Russia meddled in the 2016 election and will try to do so again, but Trump has ignored that and instead pushed the idea that Ukraine is somehow even more to blame. He explicitly told Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky that he'd like to see Ukraine investigate the 2016 election and <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/867571/trump-asked-ukraines-president-look-into-dnc-email-hack">baselessly claimed</a> the country has a physical server holding the hacked Democratic National Committee emails. These unfounded claims have led to the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump and apparently left Putin thrilled that he's out of the conversation.</p>
      <p>Just because Russia is out of the spotlight doesn't mean the country isn't still attempting to interfere in the 2020 presidential elections. Special Counsel Robert Mueller <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/854700/mueller-says-russian-election-interference-been-underplayed">relayed a warning</a> about Russian election interference during his congressional hearing back in April, saying it was likely happening as he testified. Putin himself <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/869172/putin-jokes-hes-going-interfere-2020-election--but-dont-tell-anybody">seemingly joked</a> last month that he's going to get meddling soon, though if we're being honest, that's probably not a joke.</p>
