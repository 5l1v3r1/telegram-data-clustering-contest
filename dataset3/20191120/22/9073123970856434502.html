      <p>Fortnite week 7 is here, and with it comes a list of new challenges to complete for our Battle Pass levels. Those of us who have been keeping up with these challenges will likely be able to hit – or come close to hitting – level 100 after finishing everything for the week.</p>
      <p>Most of the Trick Shot challenges, as they’re called, are easy enough to complete by simply playing the game. A couple of them will take a bit of searching, which is where we come in. Here’s your guide to dancing at the Pipeman, the Hayman, and the Timber Tent for Fortnite week 7.</p>
      <h3>Dance at the Pipeman, the Hayman, and the Timber Tent</h3>
      <p>Here are the locations of the Pipeman, the Hayman, and the Timber Tent on the map. The red circle indicates the Hayman, the blue references the Pipeman, and the black shows where to find the Timber Tent.</p>
