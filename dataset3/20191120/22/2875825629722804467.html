      <h1>Andy Murray admits being overweight as Great Britain squeeze to Davis Cup win</h1>
      <h2>Leon Smith's side only squeezed past world No.19 Holland thanks to a narrow doubles win, while Murray just about beat world No.179 Tallon Griekspoor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:33:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Andy Murray claimed Great Britain had not taken Holland lightly after ­admitting he was still too heavy at the Davis Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>Leon Smith’s team only squeezed to victory over the world No.19 nation thanks to a narrow win in the ­doubles.</p>
      <p>British No.1 Dan Evans was flattened by Holland’s Robin Haase.</p>
      <p>And Andy Murray said he deserved to lose to world No.179 Tallon Griekspoor before mounting a ­remarkable fightback to win.</p>
      <p>Murray then revealed he had not prepared to face the Dutch No.2 – and was still ­carrying extra baggage from celebrating his Antwerp title and the recent birth of his third child Teddy.</p>

      <p>“The weight, that’s my fault,” he said. “If you’re weighing four or five kilos more than you’re used to, that is probably going to affect how you feel moving around the court and stuff.</p>
      <p>“So I’ll make sure when I do have breaks, I’m more careful with what I’m ­eating and look at that. When I was 25, it was quite easy.”</p>
      <p>With the GB team also ­dropping in lines from Frozen into the pre-tournament press ­conference, they did not appear to be taking the Dutch too ­seriously. And they only just got away with it yesterday.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t think that that was the case – I was taking the match very seriously today,” said Murray.</p>

      <p>“When you have a child, maybe that becomes your ­priority for a period of time as well and maybe I could have got on the practice courts sooner. But I also had an issue with my elbow. But no, I wouldn’t say I’ve taken the first match lightly.”</p>
      <p>But the British team had prepared Murray to play world No.200 Botic van de Zandschulp and Murray had an hour to swot up on Griekspoor.</p>
      <p>He has won only twice on the ATP Tour, but played the match of his life to fire down 23 aces.</p>

      <p>Murray battled back from a break down in the final set – and from 1-4 down in the ­tiebreak – to win 6-7 6-4 7-6.</p>
      <p>“I told you guys I wasn’t feeling in the best shape coming in and it showed a little bit in the match,” said ­Murray, who is also suffering from a cough.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I ­deserved to win that match. But it is about finding a way to win and I did that today.”</p>
      <p>Evans served for the match at 5-4 in the second set before losing 3-6 7-6 6-4 to Haase.</p>
      <p>But Jamie Murray and ­debutant Neal Skupski ­eventually sealed the win by beating Wesley Koolhof and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4 7-6.</p>
      <p>Smith said: “It was another day of incredible drama and a hell of an effort from Holland.”</p>
      <p>Britain will win Group E by beating Kazakhstan in their second match today. And they could then play Germany in the quarter-finals tomorrow after they shocked Argentina.</p>
