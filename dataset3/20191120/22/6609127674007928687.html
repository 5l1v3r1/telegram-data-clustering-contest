        <b>RYAN JACK feared a nasty Hampden tackle would rule him out of the run of games which could make or break Rangers' season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> midfielder was relieved to emerge unhurt after Kazakhstan sub Islambek Kuat rammed his studs into his shin.</p>

      <p>Kuat escaped with just a yellow card, but Jack felt it should easily have been red.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> he suffered no lasting damage and will be fit to face <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14917/hamilton/">Hamilton</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>That clash at the Fountain of Youth Stadium is the first of ten matches for Steven Gerrard’s side between now and the winter break.</p>
      <p>The Light Blues face Europa League clashes with Feyenoord and Young Boys and a Betfred Cup Final with holders <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a>.</p>

      <p>There’s also the small matter of away Premiership trips to face <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Aberdeen</a>, Celtic, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14921/motherwell/">Motherwell</a> and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/">Hibs</a> during December</p>
      <p>Jack said: “My leg is fine. Obviously it was a bad one, but the ref has only seen it as a yellow.</p>
      <p>“There were a few naughty challenges throughout the match. I don’t know what was behind that, but the referee is there to protect us. Thankfully no one is injured.”</p>
      <p>Jack knows only too well the significance of the games that lie ahead over the next five weeks.</p>
      <p>They will place huge mental and physical demands on the Ibrox side.</p>
      <p>But Jack reckons the fact there is no time to think about them is a big advantage given what is at stake.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a really tough schedule and there’s no doubt there’s a lot of high-pressure games. But you’re at a big club and that’s how you want it.</p>
      <p>“Maybe at the end of the season I’ll notice if it’s tiring, but it’s just game, train, recover, game, train, recover and your body gets into a routine.</p>

      <p>“You don’t really have time to think about it. It’s playing on a Thursday, recover, then play on a Sunday, recover, and then play midweek.</p>
      <p>“You just take every game as it comes. If you have a bad result, you want to put it right and you’ve got games so close to each other that you get the chance to do that.</p>
      <p>“There’s tough games coming up in Europe as well. Feyenoord away will be very tough, then Young Boys at home. They have been doing very well in the group.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a lot of work to do before we can say we’ve achieved anything.”</p>
      <p>Jack impressed for Scotland in both victories against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old dovetailed well alongside Celtic’s Callum McGregor in the middle of the park as Steve Clarke’s team ended a poor qualifying campaign with a third straight win.</p>
      <p>Jack is convinced the wins have given the national team massive momentum ahead of the Euro 2020 play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>And he also feels the boost generated from that will benefit him at club level.</p>

      <p>Jack said: “The last three wins really help us.</p>
      <p>"We’re playing alongside each other more often, but it’s frustrating that there’s going to be a wee bit of a break now.</p>
      <p>“If we had these games next month there would be a feel-good factor from the last games.</p>
      <p>“We’ll all go back to our clubs and look to play well and stay in the manager’s thoughts. I’m sure come March everyone will be involved.</p>
      <p>“You want to win matches. You don’t want to come away and get beat and then go back to your club not feeling good about yourself.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully on this trip we’ve been able to get two wins, so that helps your confidence going back to your club.</p>
      <p>“There’s lots of big games coming up and lots to look forward to.</p>
      <p>“The next two games will be massive. The games I’ve had over the last two years have helped me get to this stage and playing for my country.</p>
      <p>“At club level, as soon as you put that jersey on there’s an expectation to win.</p>
      <p>“Then you come to Scotland and play alongside top-class players and there’s an expectancy, from the supporters and staff, to go and win games as well.</p>
      <p>"Since I’ve come along to the squad the manager has said he wants positivity and everyone wanting to be here to play for Scotland.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t want any negativity and this week we’ve not had that.</p>
      <p>“We’ve managed to end it in a good way with three wins in three games and that takes us into the play-offs in March.”</p>
      <p>Next up for Jack is a game on Hamilton Accies’ plastic pitch at the weekend and he is adamant there will be no problem adjusting to the least glamorous trip in the Premiership.</p>
      <p>He added: “Not at all. There is different pressure for each of the games we are involved in.</p>
      <p>“But going back to your club, it’s back to getting three points and keeping that momentum going that we’ve had.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a great month with great results and Sunday will be a big test for us.”</p>
