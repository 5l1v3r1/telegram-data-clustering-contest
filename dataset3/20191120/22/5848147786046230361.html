      <h1>Attorney-General puts faith-based hospitals and aged care legislation on agenda</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:33:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/samantha/" target="_blank">Samantha Maiden</a></address>
      <p>Christian Porter wants faith-based hospitals and aged care homes to have the same rights as schools to hire and fire on the basis of religion.</p>
      <p>The Attorney-General outlined the proposed change on Wednesday, arguing it would ensure aged care homes and hospitals can make staffing decisions to maintain “the religious ethos and culture of the organisation”.</p>
      <p>Mr Porter suggested it was more about allowing positive discrimination, not banning religious workers from getting jobs.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want people refused a job because they’re Catholic or Islamic faith or whatever their faith may be,” he told ABC TV.</p>
      <p>“You need to have an exemption so that churches and religious organisations can prefer people over their own faith.</p>
      <p>“The question is just how do you define a religious organisation? Everyone accepts schools are religious organisations.”</p>
      <p>Mr Porter rejected any suggestion this would allow a hospital or aged care home to discriminate against a worker because they are gay.</p>
      <p>“No. Because that’s not on a religious basis,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The exemption is only an exemption to make a decision about an employee based on their faith. Not their sexuality, not their age, not the fact they might have a disability.</p>
      <p>“Aged care providers at the moment, a religious aged care provider can employ people of its own religion. That happens now.”</p>
      <p>The proposed changes follow consultations with faith-based hospitals and the aged care sector.</p>
      <p>“But the hospitals and aged care facilities effectively said to us they don’t make decisions about admitting patients based on the patient’s faith.</p>
      <p>“That’s not a matter that we’re giving an extension to. There might be other changes.”</p>
      <p>Asked about his own religious beliefs, Mr Porter said that he was not a regular churchgoer, but a belief in a higher power was a good insurance policy.</p>
      <p>“Do I believe in God? Sure. It’s very dangerous not to.”</p>
      <p>The Attorney-General confirmed securing the passage of the laws would be tricky and he offered no expected timeline for the laws to secure parliamentary approval.</p>
      <p>Mr Porter also flagged potentially ground-breaking reforms to treat social media giants Facebook and Twitter like any other publisher.</p>
      <p>“After the very curious decision in Voller v Nationwide News and Ors which held that the respective media companies (not Facebook) were, for the purposes of defamation law, the ‘publishers’ of third-party comments posted to their public Facebook pages – it is clear that to have a level playing field between online publishers such as Facebook and Twitter and traditional media publishers reform in this area is very necessary,” he said.</p>
