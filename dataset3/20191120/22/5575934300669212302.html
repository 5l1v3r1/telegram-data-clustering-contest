      <p>Good morning and good luck.</p>
      <p>1. After <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-bbc-interview-reputation-crumbling-2019-11">a disastrous — and now infamous — interview with the BBC</a> in which he tried to explain away his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/prince-andrew-stepping-away-royal-2019-11"><b>Prince Andrew has resigned from his public royal duties</b></a>. It makes him one of the most high-profile casualties of the ever-unfolding saga.</p>
      <p>2. <b>Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter could be sued for what their users post in Australia</b>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/facebook-twitter-social-media-new-defamation-laws-australia-2019-11">after Attorney-General Christian Porter flagged sweeping reforms to our defamation laws</a>. This comes after the NSW Federal Court ruled media companies were legally responsible for their social media pages. In Porter’s words: “My own view is that online platforms, so far as reasonably possible, should be held to essentially the same standards as other publishers.”</p>
      <p>3. <b>In what could be the biggest court case in banking history,</b> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/westpac-austrac-child-exploitation-court-money-laundering-2019-11">Westpac allegedly violated anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws an astounding 23 million times.</a> The regulator says the big bank “didn’t know and [still] doesn’t know” where billions of dollars it processed between 2013 and 2018 originated, with fears some of it was tied to child exploitation. There’s no sweeping this one under the rug.</p>

      <p>4. <b>Signed up for Disney’s new streaming service, Disney Plus?</b> You might want to change your password again. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/disney-plus-australia-hack-account-security-flaw-2019-11">Australian users have been warned that a security flaw could expose their account</a>, after thousands of accounts were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-accounts-are-available-for-free-in-hacker-forums-already-2019-11/?r=AU&amp;IR=T">hacked and sold online in the US</a>. Turns out “[yourname]123” isn’t fooling anyone.</p>
      <p>5. <b>An Australian and an American teacher have been released by the Taliban</b> after spending three years in captivity. American Kevin King, 63, and Australian Timothy Weeks, 50, were<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/taliban-returns-american-australian-hostages-in-prisoner-swap-2019-11"> “successfully recovered” after they were swapped for senior Al Qaida-linked members.</a> Both men had been teaching at the University of Afghanistan in 2016 when they were kidnapped at gunpoint.</p>
      <p>6. <b>Amazon Australia, just a few years into its launch, is finally upping the ante.</b> On Wednesday, it rolled out “Amazon Hub”, its locker delivery system to select locations around New South Wales and Victoria, as well as expanding its parcel pickup points at participating businesses. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/amazon-hub-australia-how-to-works-2019-11">Here’s how it works.</a></p>
      <p>7. Finally something truly viral to emerge from the Trump impeachment hearings. A photo of Trump holding what appears to be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trumps-ukraine-talking-points-photo-sharpie-2019-11">his prepared talking points</a> have emerged and they’re, well, pretty simple. “I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo” written in giant sharpie letters, has already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/president-trumps-written-memo-has-become-a-meme-2019-11">inspired a host of memes</a>. If Trump does end up testifying himself, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nancy-pelosi-invites-trump-to-testify-in-impeachment-inquiry-2019-11">as Democrats want</a>, it’ll be quite the spectacle.</p>

      <p>8. <b>Softbank, the Japanese company that pumped money into the WeWork trainwreck, has some other interesting ideas you might like to hear too. It has c<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/softbank-robot-vacuum-whiz-self-driving-tech-photos-2019-11">reated its own robot vacuum called Whiz that uses self-driving car technology and costs $US500 a month.</a> Admittedly, not its worst venture.</b></p>
      <p>9. <b>Life on….Jupiter?</b> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nasa-water-vapor-jupiter-moon-europa-2019-11">NASA has just found water vapour for the first time on one of Jupiter’s moons, Europa</a>, suggesting it could be home to a hidden ocean with twice as much water as Earth. It now makes the moon our best hope of finding alien life.</p>

      <p>10. <b>Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly created a major divide in his company</b>, after lambasting China. His sharp tongue is apparently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mark-zuckerberg-china-criticism-alienating-employees-2019-11">not going down well with many of the social media giant’s employees</a>, many of whom are from the mainland. While some see it as a way of trying to win favour with US lawmakers, it could be time to dial it back or risk some awkward office elevator moments.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-woman-saves-crying-koala-bear-from-fire-in-australia-2019-11#x1TKuwsV6tGZzqeC.99">Video has emerged of an Australian woman saving a badly wounded, crying koala from a bushfire.</a> “I knew if we didn’t get him down from the tree then he would have been up there amongst the flames,” she said. Bravo.</p>
