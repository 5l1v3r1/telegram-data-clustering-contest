      <h3>Joe Biden Campaign Accidentally Sends Post-Debate Email Before Debate</h3>

      <p>Democratic presidential primary candidate <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>, known for his numerous campaign trail gaffes, appears to be staying on-brand, if unintentionally. According to <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/20/biden-blasts-out-post-debate.html"><i>Boing Boing</i></a>, the former vice president sent out a post-debate email ahead of Wednesday’s Democratic presidential debate.</p>
      <p>“I’m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now. I hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important,” the email begins.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the email calls for “more plans,” which appears to be a shot at second-place primary candidate Elizabeth Warren, who frequently touts her vast number of policy plans, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/20/biden-team-debate-fundraising-plea-2020-072212"><i>Politico</i></a> reported. The shot could signal that Biden intends to again go after Warren at the debate, following his attacks on her during his October performance.</p>
      <p>About an hour after the email was sent, Biden’s campaign sent a follow-up email addressing the mistake, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471345-biden-campaign-sends-post-debate-fundraising-pitch-before-debate"><i>The Hill</i></a> reported.</p>
      <blockquote>“We know Joe is going to make us proud tonight. We were just so excited for it that we accidentally hit send too soon.”</blockquote>
      <p>The follow-up email also made the most of the mistake and asked supporters to pitch into the campaign to help it reach a $90,000 fundraising goal before the debate.</p>
      <p>Many political figures took to Twitter to ridicule the slip-up.</p>
      <p>“Our front runner ladies and gentlemen. They can’t even properly schedule an email,” wrote progressive commentator Krystal Ball.</p>
      <p>“Joe Biden’s campaign is as confused and mistake-prone as their candidate,” tweeted Donald Trump’s War Room Twitter account.</p>
      <p>“So it’s not just Joe Biden who is confused, his entire campaign is,” wrote Marc Lotter, the director of strategic communications for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign.</p>

      <p>Biden will take the debate stage tonight alongside nine others: Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer. The 77-year-old politician has managed to maintain a healthy lead in the polls, despite his campaign’s many slip-ups.</p>
      <p>After last month’s debate, a Morning Consult poll revealed that Biden <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5697719/debate-joe-biden-lead-unchanged-democratic-race-poll/">commanded a 10-point lead</a> over Warren, who was still in second place at the time. <i>RealClearPolitics</i> shows Biden has an average of 30.7 percent polling support heading into tonight’s debate, with Warren still in second with 18 percent support — an improvement for Biden when compared to where they stood heading into the previous debate.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg continues to rise in the polls and maybe the <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5752000/buttigieg-double-digit-lead-early-voting-state/">next contender</a> to pose a threat to Biden. In a recent Saint Anselm College poll of New Hampshire primary voters, Buttigieg took the first place spot, with a 10-point lead over Biden and Warren, who were tied for second place.</p>
