      <h1>Jamie Carragher warns Jurgen Klopp over Liverpool's Premier League title bid</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool are facing fixture chaos and Jamie Carragher has warned Jurgen Klopp cannot let it impact their Premier League title charge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:51:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has been urged to avoid the temptation of risking star players in cup competitions by Jamie Carragher.</p>
      <p>Club legend Carragher knows more than most the desire to bring Premier League glory to Merseyside for the first time.</p>
      <p>They are early front-runners having raced eight points clear at the top of the table after 12 games.</p>
      <p>But Carragher is wary of their fixture chaos as they are set to be forced to send separate squads to the FIFA Club World Cup and their Carabao Cup semi-final.</p>
      <p>And the ex-England defender has warned Klopp to let "nothing" get in the way of their title charge.</p>

      <p>"I know a lot of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> supporters wouldn’t say this, and certainly the club couldn’t, but nothing can get in the way of Liverpool winning the league. Nothing," Carragher told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jamie-carragher-liverpools-club-world-17276123">Liverpool Echo</a> .</p>
      <p>"The Aston Villa game in the Carabao Cup? If Liverpool get through they will have two semi-finals to play then and that cannot get in the way of Liverpool winning the league.</p>
      <p>"What I mean by that is do not play anyone in your first XI in that Carabao Cup team. Not one. ‘If Liverpool win the league this year and find themselves in the same position next year I wouldn’t be saying that.</p>

      <p>"I’d probably be saying 'we are Liverpool Football Club. We should try and win the lot.'</p>
      <p>"But because it has been so long nothing can be allowed to get in the way of Liverpool pushing on and winning the league."</p>
      <p>Whilst the Premier League is of paramount importance, Carragher has also talked up the need to bid for Club World Cup glory for the first time in their history as they face just two games in December.</p>

      <p>"The Club World Cup, for me, is very important." he said. "A lot of people outside Liverpool don’t understand that. But really it’s massive for Liverpool. They have never won it before. To be able to say you’re the world champions.</p>
      <p>"Liverpool have won the League Cup a record amount of times and will have other chances again. It might be another 20 years before we get the chance to become world champions again."</p>
