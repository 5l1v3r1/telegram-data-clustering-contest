      <p>The Dorrigo Show committee has decided to cancel the fireworks display scheduled for Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"Although the committee was completely satisfied that the fireworks would be safe, they have been postponed to a more appropriate time when the fires are out and the smoke has cleared and everyone on the plateau and beyond has a reason to celebrate," a spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>"We would like to thank you all for the comments, opinions and feedback, both online and in person. Most of it was useful in our decision-making. Our whole purpose is to provide a community event that pleases as many people as possible. Having your feedback is a great way to help us achieve that.</p>
      <p>"We look forward to the 'wet season' when we may all breathe easily again and to another event hosted by us that supports our families, our friends and our community. As for the show, we hope you will continue to support us by coming along to enjoy what we have provided."</p>
      <p>The annual fun run on Sunday morning has also been called off due to the health issues posed by exercising in smoky conditions.</p>
      <p>However, the three-day event will still offer constant entertainment.</p>
      <p>Highlights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Friday night rodeo</li>
        <li>A Circus Challenge on Saturday evening that will have young and the not so young engaged in various activities.</li>
        <li>The Backtrack Boys demonstrating dog high jumps.</li>
        <li>A Bush Dog demonstration by a leading trialler Warren Taylor, commentated by Scott Amon, Saturday at 10am.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Old show favourites which draw big numbers include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A large beef cattle show, highlighting many British and European breeds</li>
        <li>A dairy cattle exhibition</li>
        <li>Numerous horse and pony classes, including show jumping</li>
        <li>Woodchops, with cross-cut sawing (for women and men) and tree felling</li>
        <li>A large array of pavilion events including children's classes, art, photography, flowers and veggies, and many more.</li>
        <li>On-ground competition for motorbike riders</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Axemen from across northern NSW will be in a corner of the showground competing in underhand, standing block and tree felling.</p>
      <p>Last year, fifteen-year-old Austin Scrivener from Walcha was a crowd favourite, finishing first in the finals for the 300mm underhand and knocking the top of his tree ahead of the rest.</p>
