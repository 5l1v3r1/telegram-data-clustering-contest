      <p>Scott Gelardi, 42, of Rosenberg, was arrested Tuesday by El Campo police when he arrived for work at Northside Elementary School, <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/man-arrested-after-camera-found-in-bathroom-on-el-campo-campus/285-5f849951-283b-40bb-905f-0d05ade1cf0f">KHOU</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Gelardi was charged with improper photography/video in a bathroom, possession of child pornography and intent to promote, the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Police-camera-found-in-Texas-elementary-child-porn-14849882.php">Houston Chronicle</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Officials from the El Campo Independent School District said maintenance workers reported discovering the camera in the boys' bathroom, <a href="https://abc13.com/5709327/">KTRK</a> reported. The camera allegedly contained video and photographs of students, who were not identified, police said.</p>
      <p>The investigation identified Geraldi, a contractor for Aramark, as the suspect, the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Police-camera-found-in-Texas-elementary-child-porn-14849882.php">Chronicle</a> reported. Police searched his school office, his apartment and his vehicle, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>At this point, no children have been identified, and there is no evidence of any physical contact with any children," the El Campo Police Department said in a news release  "ECISD personnel have searched all school bathrooms, and no other devices have been discovered."</p>
      <p>Gelardi's bail was set at $70,000, <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/man-arrested-after-camera-found-in-bathroom-on-el-campo-campus/285-5f849951-283b-40bb-905f-0d05ade1cf0f">KHOU</a> reported. </p>
