      <h1>Golden Knights’ Gallant says Fleury save is ‘the best I’ve seen’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:17:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/david-schoen/" target="_blank">David Schoen</a></address>
      <p>Plenty of goaltenders want to reach a career milestone with little fanfare and the spotlight pointed in a different direction.</p>
      <p>Marc-Andre Fleury says he’s like that. Then the Golden Knights’ backstop makes a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/goldenknights/marc-andre-fleurys-save-of-century-lights-up-social-media-1896686/">gravity-defying glove save</a> and smiles and giggles to everybody watching back home in Canada.</p>
      <p>He just can’t help himself.</p>
      <p>“He has that style and that flair,” backup goalie Malcolm Subban said.</p>
      <p>Fleury set the early benchmark for save of the year with his diving stop on Nic Petan in Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/goldenknights/marc-andre-fleurys-spectacular-diving-save-lifts-golden-knights-4-2-1896648/">4-2 victory</a> over the Toronto Maple Leafs at T-Mobile Arena, becoming the seventh goalie in league history to reach 450 wins in the process.</p>
      <p>While it’s a fun debate whether it was Fleury’s finest save in a Knights uniform, coach Gerard Gallant said it’s not even close.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been around a long time,” he said. “It’s the best I’ve seen.”</p>
