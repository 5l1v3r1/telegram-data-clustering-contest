      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> contestant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> grilled fellow campmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> on her ‘beef’ with Cheryl during her Girls Aloud days.</p>
      <p>As the duo were chatting, Jacqueline couldn’t help but ask Nadine about her time in the girl band and questioned whether they were put together like Little Mix were on The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>.</p>
      <p>Nadine explained: ‘Really good, really good, I liked being in a girl band. I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I’m used to being around girls.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘The public had voted, it was ITV’s Popstars the Rivals so a girl band and a boy band and the public put us together.’</p>

      <p>On Tuesday’s episode <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-reveals-why-shes-not-friends-with-girls-aloud-anymore-11183751/">Kate Garraway also couldn’t help but ask Nadine</a> why she wasn’t friends with the other members of Girls Aloud or saw them.</p>
      <p>Nadine responded: ‘Everyone gets on with their lives, I was friends with them all, it was all nice and lovely.</p>
      <p>‘But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys, I’d be out partying, me and ten guys, I was having a laugh, I was 18-19 years old.’</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud – made up of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cheryl-fernandez-versini/">Cheryl</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sarah-harding/">Sarah Harding</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nicola-roberts/">Nicola Roberts</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kimberly-walsh/">Kimberly Walsh</a> – were created through the ITV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002.</p>
