      <p>BEIJING: British carmaker Aston Martin unveiled its first-ever sports utility vehicle (SUV) on Wednesday (Nov 20) at events in Beijing and Los Angeles, signalling it was banking on China's growing appetite for luxury to prop up sales.</p>
      <p>Dubbed the DBX, the new vehicle is the biggest expansion in Aston Martin's range in the brand's history, CEO Andy Palmer said at its launch.</p>

      <p>The company - whose cars play a central role in the fictional British spy James Bond blockbuster films - has struggled financially in recent years, posting a loss of 13.5 million pounds last quarter.</p>
      <p>But with its growing appetite for gas-guzzling SUVs, China presents an opportunity for the ailing carmaker, which has been hit by Brexit woes and slowing demand in Europe.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1913, Aston Martin hopes to "more than double" its sales in China, which currently stand at around 500 units per year, Palmer told AFP.</p>
      <p>Nearly half of all new car purchases registered in China last year were SUVs, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>But the growing demand for SUVs was causing environmental headaches.</p>
      <p>Emissions from SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global carbon dioxide (Co2) emissions from 2010 to 2018 after power generation, the International Energy Agency said last month.</p>
      <p>In that period, SUVs more than doubled their global market share from 17 per cent to 39 per cent, with a contribution to annual emissions rising to more than 700 megatonnes of Co2, the agency said.</p>
      <p>Palmer said that the DBX was "obviously geared for performance, that's what an Aston Martin is all about" when asked about the environmental impact of the new car.</p>
      <p>With a four-litre, V8 twin turbo-charged engine, the DBX is capable of a top speed of 291km per hour and doing 0-97kmh in 4.5 seconds.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin says it has splurged on the details and was betting on China's growing demand for luxury for success.</p>
      <p>The five-seater is priced at US$189,900 in the US, with officials saying they expected a similar price in China.</p>
      <p>Palmer said Aston Martin plans to follow in the footsteps of its German rival Porsche, which unveiled an electric model in September, and relaunch its Lagonda series "as a fully electric brand" by 2022 or 2023.</p>
