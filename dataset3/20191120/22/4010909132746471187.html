      <p>Based on a <a href="http://www.kwongwah.com.my/20191120/%e6%b0%91%e8%88%aa%e5%b1%80%e4%b8%8d%e6%89%b9%e5%87%86-%e9%a3%9e%e8%a1%8c%e8%bd%a6%e9%a3%9e%e4%b8%8d%e4%ba%86/">statement</a> by the <b>Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia</b>, it seems that <b>Malaysia’s first flying car won't be tested</b> on 21 November 2019. This is due to the fact, that the EH216 Flying Car was not given the clearance to conduct tests at UniKL MIAT.</p>
      <p>However, CAAM has mentioned that they are open to having the flying vehicle tested in Malaysia as long as it has all the necessary paperwork and it is conducted in an approved area to ensure safety. With all that said, some netizen has noted that the flying vehicle was only able to ascend and descend in place and was not able to fly around.</p>

      <p>Many have also mentioned that the vehicle seemed unstable, which sparked the question of whether the minister should be in the cockpit fearing that they might need to re-elect a new minister if the worse were to happen.
