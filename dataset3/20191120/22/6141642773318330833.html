      <p>Joe Allen believes Ryan Giggs has made his critics “eat their words” after leading Wales to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Giggs was not a universally popular choice to succeed Chris Coleman – who led Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 – in January 2018, with large sections of the fan base unhappy at his appointment.</p>
      <p>The Manchester United great upset Wales supporters during his celebrated playing career by regularly failing to turn up for international duty.</p>

      <p>The 45-year-old also came in for heavy criticism over selection and tactics during Wales’ summer setback in Croatia and Hungary, defeats which left Euro 2020 qualification hopes hanging in the balance.</p>
      <p>But Wales took eight points from their final four qualifiers, with Tuesday’s 2-0 home win over Hungary sealing their second successive appearance at the Euros, and third in all at major tournaments.</p>
      <p>“He’d had stick. But he has delivered, simple as that,” Allen said of Giggs.</p>
      <p>“He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success, and it was always going to be tough.</p>

      <p>“That is one of the big reasons we have made it. He has done the job – the ambition and target was to get to the Euros.</p>
      <p>“Any way you get there is huge success, and I think a lot of people are going to have to eat their words.”</p>
      <p>Allen, alongside the likes of Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, is among the survivors of the side who reached the last four in France in 2016.</p>
      <blockquote>We didn't want to be a flash in the pan, a one-hit wonder if you like<cite>Joe Allen</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who fell just short with Wales in their 2018 World Cup qualifying bid, has played a crucial role in the current campaign, not only through his own performances but also helping the development of young midfielders Ethan Ampadu, Joe Morrell and Matthew Smith.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t want to be a flash in the pan, a one-hit wonder if you like,” Allen said.</p>
      <p>“That World Cup disappointment has spurred on a lot of people. A lot of us are getting older and we realise how precious these chances are.</p>
      <p>“The players who have done it before were motivated to get there again and we’ve banged on to the young lads how good it was.</p>

      <p>Wales will head to Euro 2020 with arguably a more talented squad than they had in France.</p>
      <p>Ampadu, Daniel James, Harry Wilson, Joe Rodon and Chris Mepham have all broken into the squad since Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth’s exciting forward David Brooks, the current Welsh Footballer of the Year, will also be back soon after missing most of the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign following ankle surgery.</p>
      <p>“It (qualifying) is different in many ways but just as good,” Allen said.</p>

      <p>“To do it for the first time was special, but on the back of missing out on the World Cup we’re thrilled to go back to the Euros.</p>
      <p>“The danger is we did so well last time that the expectation and the bar is going to be raised.</p>
      <p>“We’ve found that in qualifying since France. Teams have made it much more difficult for us and I don’t think we’ll be so much of a surprise package at this Euros for other teams.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve got players that can hurt any team. We’ll go out there and give it all guns blazing.”</p>
