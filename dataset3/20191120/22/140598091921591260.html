      <h1>Ryan Giggs almost in tears as Wales players sing his name while Joe Allen tells critics to 'eat their words'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/sam-dean/" target="_blank">Sam Dean</a></address>
      <p>Joe Allen has told the critics of Ryan Giggs to “eat their words” after the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wales-football-team/">Wales </a>manager guided his side to a major international tournament in his first qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>Wales secured their place in next summer’s European Championships after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/aaron-ramsey-inspired-wales-secure-euro-2020-qualification-victory/">a stirring victory against Hungary on Tuesday night</a> which left an unusually emotional Giggs on the verge of tears.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester United winger’s name was sung by his players in the dressing room after the match, with Giggs describing it as “one of the greatest nights of my life”.</p>
      <p>Giggs was not a universally popular appointment when he was given the Wales job in January 2018. His critics said he had not shown enough commitment to his country as a player and questioned his lack of managerial experience compared to the departed Chris Coleman.</p>
      <p>Those doubts were only strengthened by a disappointing start to this qualifying campaign, with Wales taking just three points from their first three games in the group.</p>

      <p>But Giggs has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround in recent games, changing the side’s shape and watching from the touchline as Wales put together a five-match unbeaten run which secured their place in a second successive European Championships.</p>
      <p>“He has delivered, simple as that,” said Allen of Giggs. “He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success. It was always going to be tough, but he has got us there.</p>
      <p>“I think questions have been asked of everything, really - selection, tactics. But nine times out of ten he has got it right. That is one the big reasons we have made it.”</p>
      <p>Asked if qualification will change the perception of Giggs among Wales supporters, Allen added: “I think so. He has done the job. The ambition and the target was to get to the Euros and we would have loved to have done it more comfortably and easily but beggars can’t be choosers.</p>
      <p>“Any way you get there is a huge success. I think a lot of people are going to have to eat with their words with some of the criticism which has been thrown at us.”</p>
      <p>Thoughts will now turn to Wales’ prospects at next year’s tournament, when they will hope to reproduce the performances that took them to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.</p>

      <p>Key members of that team, such as Gareth Bale and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/17/aaron-ramsey-backs-wales-new-generation-get-job-done/">Aaron Ramsey</a>, are still crucial to their hopes but younger talents such as Daniel James, Harry Wilson and David Brooks will provide genuine depth in creative positions.</p>
      <p>“Players have come and gone from the 2016 squad but that is natural over three years down the line,” said Allen. “We have lost big players but the young lads and the other lads who have come in have stepped up to the plate. I am excited. I don’t think we have an obvious weakness.”</p>
      <p>Among the younger players hoping to experience an international tournament for the first time is Chris Mepham, the Bournemouth defender who was not even playing first-team football during Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>“It is one of the best feelings for me in my career,” the 22-year-old said. “It’s my proudest moment so far.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/gareth-bale-says-playing-wales-exciting-real-madrid/">Bale’s fractious relationship with Real Madrid</a> was further damaged on Tuesday night when the Wales captain celebrated their qualification with a fan-made banner reading ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid - In that order’.</p>
      <p>Bale has played four games for Wales since he last appeared for Madrid, the club he was set to leave this summer before his move to China was called off by Real Madrid’s board.</p>
      <p>Bale has been consistently criticised by supporters and Madrid-based media for his passion for golf and he has made no attempt in recent months to hide his preference for playing for his country rather than his club.</p>
      <p>Spanish reports have claimed that he may now be forced to train alone after further angering Madrid with his decision to celebrate with the flag, which is an adaptation of a chant first aired by Wales fans in Azerbaijan last weekend.</p>
