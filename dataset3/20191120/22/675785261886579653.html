      <h1>Prince Andrew asked Queen for forgiveness after being told to step down</h1>
      <h2>The Duke of York has been forced to withdraw from royal duties for the "foreseeable future" after his Newsnight appearance in an astonishing day of developments</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:47:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:47</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew yesterday apologised to the Queen for bringing shame on the Royal Family as he was forced to bow out of public life.</p>
      <p>The Prince said his relationship with pervert Jeffrey Epstein had become a “major disruption” as he kissed goodbye to his £249,000 royal allowance.</p>
      <p>And - finally - of Epstein’s victims he said: “I deeply sympathise with everyone affected.”</p>
      <p>In an astonishing day of developments, Andrew had an emergency meeting with the Queen where he issued a grovelling apology for heaping shame on the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>A senior Palace source confirmed the Duke had vowed to “not return to public life until the Epstein case is closed or he has cleared his name”.</p>
      <p>The palace insider said “that could be a considerable amount of time”.</p>
      <p>The Mirror can reveal Prince Charles was consulted on the move and agreed it was the right decision after Andrew’s car-crash BBC interview on Saturday.</p>

      <p> Sources confirmed Andrew will cease to receive £249,000 of taxpayers’ money from the Sovereign Grant used to pay for his office. </p>
      <p>The reality means he will have to rely on handouts from his mum from her Duchy of Lancaster money which made £21million in profits last year.</p>
      <p>Senior palace aides told the humiliated duke the furore over his Newsnight appearance and shameful excuses for staying at Epstein’s house were damaging the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>It came as big businesses and other organisations continued to withdraw support for his charity work.</p>
      <p>As BT became the latest company to distance itself from Andrew, he appealed to his mother for forgiveness over what some see as the most damaging episodes for the Crown in modern history.</p>

      <p>The palace later issued the bombshell statement signalling Andrew’s exit from public life.</p>
      <p>The statement from the Duke read: “The circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going in the organisations and charities I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>“His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>“I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”</p>
      <p>Despite the crisis, the Queen was all smiles tonight as she presented her old friend Sir David Attenborough with a top international award – arriving just 24 minutes after her son made his explosive announcement.</p>

      <p>A highly placed source said Andrew had “absolutely no alternative” but to step down with “so many devastating revelations being made day after day about his relationship with Epstein”.</p>
      <p>The source added: “He knew he couldn’t carry on but also felt overwhelmingly that he has made terrible mistakes that were reflecting badly on the Queen.</p>
      <p>“Since his interview with Emily Maitlis he has been in a state of paralysis, worrying about not only the effect on the family but also knowing his royal position was going to have to be massively undermined for the foreseeable future.”</p>
      <p>Amid a cascade of global business giants and educational institutions around the world queuing up to drop him, another blow was landed by telecoms giant BT.</p>
      <p>It called for Andrew to be removed as patron of iDEA – The Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for BT said: “We are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage.”</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace initially said the Duke was still the patron of iDEA, but hours later issued his statement.</p>

      <p>Social historian Professor Judith Rowbotham compared the developments to the abdication of Edward VIII. She said: “I suppose the nearest would be the Duke of Windsor. There are plenty of parallels there.”</p>
      <p>Royal author Penny Junor said the Queen would be “horrified” a relatively senior royal “should be forced to retire from public life”.</p>
      <p>But she added: “It was inevitable and it was the right thing to do. It was the only course of action for the duke and the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>“I think the monarchy is going through very difficult times – I think it’s been a disastrous year.”</p>

      <p>The future of Andrew’s private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, is also in the balance after reports she helped convince Andrew to do the interview. The Prince was criticised afterwards for failing to show empathy with Epstein’s victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the billionaire financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial.</p>
      <p>A cloud of uncertainty also now hangs over Andrew’s eldest daughter Beatrice’s wedding next year.</p>
      <p>Royal sources suggested she may be forced into having “a private wedding, in a castle or abroad, away from publicity”.</p>
      <p>Other organisations are considering ditching their involvement with the prince.</p>
      <p>Outward Bound and the British Exploring Society will hold meetings this week to discuss the situation.</p>
      <p>The Jubilee Sailing Trust is understood to be reviewing the duke’s patronage next month while the youth charities Positive2 and the Golf Foundation say they are “monitoring the situation closely”.</p>
      <p>Banking giant Barclays threatened to cancel its involvement with entrepreneur scheme Pitch@Palace saying it was “concerned” about the situation and is keeping its involvement “under review”.</p>
      <p>At least two universities in the UK and three in Australia have ended their relationship with the scheme or said were reviewing it.</p>
      <p>And a row has broken out at one of the country’s most prestigious mixed public schools over its association with Andrew.</p>
      <p>Parents are demanding action over the Duke’s links to the Royal Hospital School, in Ipswich.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Prince Andrew’s continued involvement with the school is causing great alarm among many people.”</p>
      <p>A statement from the school read: “There are no plans for the Duke to visit the school.”</p>
