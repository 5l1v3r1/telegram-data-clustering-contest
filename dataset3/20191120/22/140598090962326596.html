      <h1>NHS chiefs said families seeking answers about baby deaths were acting with 'venom'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Donnelly, Health Editor , Eleanor Steafel</a></address>
      <p>The then head of the hospital which had what is likely to be the NHS’ worst ever maternity scandal said families seeking answers were full of “venom,” leaked emails reveal.</p>
      <p>The disclosures came as more families came forward to say they had suffered harm at the hands of Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, a leaked report revealed that a “toxic” culture saw the death of 45 mothers and babies, with more than 50 children suffering brain damage linked to alleged failings in care. </p>
      <p>An independent investigation is looking at more than 600 cases, amid allegations that failings at the trust date back four decades. </p>
      <p>Emails seen by the Telegraph reveal the contempt and disdain with which parents who fought for answers have been treated.</p>
      <p>The inquiry was launched following a long battle by Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton, whose daughter Kate died shortly after birth in 2009, following a catalogue of failings by the Trust.</p>
      <p>The couple said they encountered a culture of “deceit and lies and cover-ups” as they struggled to uncover the truth about what happened to their child.</p>
      <p>Emails show that in 2014, the trust’s then chief executive, Peter Herring, said that the couple had “had a right go at me” in their written complaint about their experiences, describing himself as the “subject of their complaint and venom”.</p>
      <p>In other emails, Trust senior managers describe the couple’s complaints as “not pleasant reading”.  </p>
      <p> Mr Herring said: "I very much regret and apologise for the use of my language in the email," saying he had not intended to cause the couple further distress.</p>
      <p>The couple said that in the hours since the scandal became public, following publication of a leaked interim report into midwifery services at the trust, they have been contacted by 15 families who say they too have fallen victim to the Trust’s poor care. </p>
      <p>The Trust has said it is working with the independent review. </p>
      <p>Its current interim chief executive, Paula Clark, said on Tuesday that she wished to “apologise unreservedly to the families who have been affected.”</p>
      <p>She said the trust was making improvements to its services, and had done a lot to address the issues raised by previous cases. </p>
      <p>Police are understood to be considering bringing corporate manslaughter charges against the Trust. </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said: “The comments of this previous chief executive do not reflect the views of our Trust, and we apologise for any distress they have caused.”</p>
