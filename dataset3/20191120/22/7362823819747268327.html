      <p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee">Tennessee</a> have arrested an elderly woman who allegedly stabbed her husband as he napped in a recliner.</p>
      <p>Pecola Duncan, 71, appeared to be in a “cheerful” and “unfazed” mood when authorities found her after the stabbing of Harold Duncan, 66, on Friday, according to an Anderson County Sheriff’s Office <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tnacso/photos/a.568316479859295/2782569978433923/?type=3&amp;theater">release</a>.</p>

      <p>Pecola Duncan reportedly told authorities she stabbed her husband because he attacked her and dragged her down a hallway. Deputies noted they saw no sign of a fight in the home and did not see any scratches or bruises that would support the claim of a struggle.</p>

      <p>Pecola led authorities to the kitchen where the knife was located.</p>
      <p>Just before she was led into jail, she asked authorities if her husband died. Before giving them a moment to respond, she added, “I hope he did.”</p>

      <p>To Pecola’s disappointment, Harold did not die, however, though his wound and blood loss appeared to be life-threatening; he was transported to a hospital. When police arrived, they witnessed Harold leaving the home with a blood-soaked towel clutched to his chest. He told Deputy Kory Blevins his wife had stabbed him while he was napping on the recliner.</p>
