      <p>Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar have responded to reports Homeland Security raided their Arkansas home.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, news broke<a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/homeland-security-raids-jim-bob-duggars-and-michelles-home-in-federal-investigation-report-says-342617/"> Homeland Security was allegedly at the Tontitown, Arkansas</a> compound the Duggar’s call home. KNWA, a local NBC affiliate in the area, was the first to report the news.</p>
      <p>The affiliate shared a Homeland Security spokesperson who said, “pursuant to an on-going federal criminal investigation”  was the reason. KNWA did not disclose the nature of the investigation. The U.S. District Attorney for Western Arkansas had no comment on the topic.</p>
      <p>20-year-old Jedidiah Duggar, who is running for Arkansas State Representative, spoke to KNWA. He denied knowing anything regarding a Federal investigation into his family.</p>

      <p>“I don’t live there, and I am not aware of any investigation,” Jedidiah shred with the affiliate.</p>
      <p>Not long after the Duggar family story was blowing up the Internet, Jim Bob and Michelle released a joint statement. They used the family’s website to deny all accusations Homeland Security was at their home.</p>
      <p>“We were shocked to see a news report today state that our home was raided by federal law enforcement agencies. This is not true. To the best of our knowledge, it’s also not true that any member of our family is the target of any investigation of any kind. Living a life in the public’s eye has taught us that it is best not to reply to every rumor and piece of ‘fake news’ that is circulated online. It would be a full-time job if we attempted to do so. However, because of tonight’s media coverage, we thought it is important to address this rumor with you. Thank you for the love and support that we can always count on in you our fans and friends,” the <i>19 and Counting</i> stars wrote.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, rumors began running ramped that the Duggar’s oldest disgraced son, Josh was the subject of an investigation. Neither the FBI nor Homeland Security has responded to those reports.</p>

      <p>It has been quite a few days for the reality TV family. Despite claims, Homeland Security has raided their Arkansas compound, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar have denied there is any truth to the reports.</p>
      <p>The family is no stranger to scrutiny. Josh’s sex addiction, cheating, and molestation of his sisters led to the cancellation of the family’s TLC show. Their conservative and religious beliefs have also put Duggar’s in the line of fire.</p>
      <p>What do you think is going on with the Duggar family?</p>
