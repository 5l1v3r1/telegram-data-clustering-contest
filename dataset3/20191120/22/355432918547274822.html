      <h1>Trump says Sondland testimony was 'fantastic'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:55:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/morgan-chalfant" target="_blank">Morgan Chalfant</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> declared victory following U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>’s public testimony Wednesday, saying it was “fantastic” and calling House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry a “hoax.”</p>
      <p>“I think it was fantastic,” President Trump said while touring an Apple plant with CEO Tim Cook in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The president repeated a portion of Sondland’s testimony during which he described a September conversation with Trump in which Trump said he wanted “no quid pro quo.”   </p>
      <p>“Why didn’t he put this statement into his opening remarks?” Trump asked, declaring the impeachment inquiry “over.”</p>
      <p>At the same time, Trump sought to put distance between himself and Sondland, saying he didn’t know him very well. </p>
      <p>“He’s a guy that got put there,” Trump told reporters, an apparent reference to Sondland’s ambassadorship. Trump nominated Sondland for the post after he donated $1 million to the president’s inaugural committee.</p>
      <p>Trump’s remarks echoed those he made <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471295-trump-dismisses-sondland-testimony-i-dont-know-him-very-well">earlier in the day</a> at the White House when he brandished and began reading notes from Sondland’s testimony that he views as exonerating him from any wrongdoing. </p>
      <p>Sondland, who <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471359-five-bombshells-from-explosive-sondland-testimony">testified publicly Wednesday</a> in connection with the impeachment inquiry, confirmed that a White House meeting with Trump was contingent on Ukraine launching investigations into 2016 election interference and Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that employed former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>'s son Hunter Biden on its board. He also said the effort to press Ukraine for investigations was widely known among top officials at the White House and State Department. </p>
      <p>House Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine for investigations that could benefit him politically. At the center of the inquiry is a July 25 call during which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server during the 2016 campaign as well as the Bidens.</p>
      <p>Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong on the call, that he applied no pressure to Ukraine and that there was “no quid pro quo.”</p>
      <p>“It’s a hoax. It’s a disgrace. It's an embarrassment to our country,” Trump said of the impeachment inquiry in Austin on Wednesday.  </p>
      <p>Trump singled out Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-Calif.), accusing her of being “incompetent.”</p>
      <p>“Nancy Pelosi has done a terrible job as Speaker,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>He also claimed without evidence that the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his conversation with Ukraine is a “political operative” and said the intelligence community's inspector general should not have allowed the complaint to move forward. </p>
