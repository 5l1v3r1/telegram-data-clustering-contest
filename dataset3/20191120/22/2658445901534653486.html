      <p>Brexit is a “national embarrassment” and stopping it will free up £50 billion to spend on public services, United Kingdom (UK) Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).</p>
      <p>The economic boost the UK will get from staying in the EU is at the heart of the party’s manifesto plan to build a “brighter future for the people”.</p>
      <p>The so-called “Remain bonus” would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra cash for schools and support for the low-paid. Other proposals include a “frequent flyer” levy and 80% renewables target.</p>
      <p>The largest single spending commitment in the 96-page document is a major expansion of free childcare,to be paid for by an increase in corporation tax and changes to capital gains allowances on the sale of assets. There are also eye-catching pledges to freeze the cost of many rail fares for five years and to legalise and tax cannabis sales to over-18s.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems are hoping to significantly boost their presence in Parliament on the back of their opposition to Brexit, as they target pro-Remain seats in the south of England and London held by the Conservatives and Labour.</p>
      <p>But, Johnson aims to change National Insurance rules so workers will not have to pay it until they earn £12,500.<br/>The Tory leader earlier said his party would put up the threshold to ensure “low tax for working people” if it wins the general election. It would be raised to £9,500 in the first budget of a Tory government, with no timetable for the additional £3,000.</p>
