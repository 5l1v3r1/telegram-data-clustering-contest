      <h4>Tamar Braxton and boyfriend David Adefeso heated things up at his birthday party when they passionately kissed several times while everyone celebrated around them.</h4>
      <p><b><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/tamar-braxton/">Tamar Braxton</a></b>, 42, began the birthday celebrating for her boyfriend <b>David Adefeso</b> days before he officially turns 50 on Nov. 23. The “Love &amp; War” songstress posted a hilarious Instagram video from his birthday festivities on Nov. 19 where she poked fun at her friends by singing a hilarious song about them being vegan. Tamar looked stunning in her Fashion Nova gear that she modeled in a separate Instagram post. The whole crowd looked to be having a great time as they laughed and danced the night away for her night in shining armor. Things took a turn for the romantic, however, when David posted his own Instagram clip of him getting up close and personal with his ladylove at the party.</p>
      <p>PDA alert! One of Tamar and David’s friends raised a toast for the birthday boy during the party that included guests like viral sensation <b>James Wright Chanel</b> (remember his video about <b>Patti Labelle</b>‘s pies?). The lovey dovey couple then went in for a kiss not once, not twice, but four times before the clip ended! “Another amazing Taco Tuesday, this time during birthday week,” David captioned the footage. “Watch how my @tamarbraxton is grabbing my shirt at the end… lil mamma can’t get enough of this sugar. And baby, I can’t ever seem to get enough of you too, thanks for a terrific start to birthday week.”</p>
      <p>Tamar and David have been getting hot and heavy on and off Instagram for months. She posted a clip of her kissing her Nigerian hunk on a beach in May 2019, where the couple <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/05/23/tamar-braxton-boyfriend-kiss-video-bikini-abs-david-adefeso/">showed off their fit bodies</a> while smooching it up.</p>

      <p>Could <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/09/18/tamar-braxton-boyfriend-marriage-wendy-williams-interview-ex-vincent-herbert/">there be wedding bells</a> for the singer and financial consultant? She’s not ruling that out after getting candid about their future on <i>The Wendy Williams Show</i> back in September 2019. “Yes,” she said in response to Wendy asking her if they will walk down the aisle together. “Now, that’s a piece of chocolate, I won’t give up.”</p>
      <p>One thing’s for certain: do not try and get with Tamar’s man. She slammed a fan who flirted with him by writing “Hey U” in a snap he posted on Instagram May 29. “Hey boo! I’m Tamar from Baltimore,” the <i>Braxton Family Values</i> star wrote in response to the flirting. “This is my boyfriend David… so correction sis… hey Ya’ll.”</p>
