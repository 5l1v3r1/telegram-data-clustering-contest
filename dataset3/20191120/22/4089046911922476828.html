      <p><b>FUKUOKA, Japan (CNN) –</b> You can spend a night in the land of the rising sun for just a buck, if you let a bunch of strangers watch.</p>
      <p>The Asahi Ryokan hotel is offering one of its rooms for just $1 per night to guests willing to be live-streamed during their stay.</p>
      <p>The hotel's 27-year-old owner said he got the idea when a British Youtuber guest broadcast much of his visit there.</p>
      <p>Travelers capitalizing on the offer will appear live on the YouTube channel One Dollar Hotel.</p>
      <p>Audio is not broadcast, and guests can turn the lights off.</p>
      <p>The bathroom is also out of camera range.</p>
      <p>When the live-streaming room isn't occupied, the video feed switches to the hotel owner working in his office.</p>
      <p>Fukuoka is a coastal city is known for its freshly-caught seafood. It’s also the birthplace of the popular Ichiran ramen noodle chain.</p>
      <p>The acclaimed Fukuoka Art Museum is also located in the city. It reopened in early 2019 following three years of renovations.</p>
