      <p>PHOTO: This Is Why Zimbabwean Parents Are In Trouble</p>
      <p>Parents with children at Bulawayo’s Dominican Convent School in Bulawayo were in for a rude awakening after school authorities <a href="https://twitter.com/daddyhope/status/1197192867392954368?s=20">announced school fees for January 2020</a>. Under the proposed fee structure, parents will be expected to pay ZWL12500 for the first term with an initial deposit of ZWL3900 being due by 29 November. To make matters worse Failure to pay the deposit will result in forfeiture of your child ‘s place.</p>
      <p>Currently, Zimbabwe is battling rampant inflation with the majority of the population earning below 200 United States Dollars, <a href="https://iharare.com/parirenyatwa-hospital-after-doctors-strike/">Doctors have been on strike for the last 3 months demanding</a> a salary adjustment from their current USD80 a month. Given that salaries for the majority of the working population are low, one is left to wonder who will afford to pay the fees the Bulawayo Dominican Convent is demanding.</p>
      <p>Check out the letter that was sent to parents below.</p>
