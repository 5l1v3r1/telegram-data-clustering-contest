      <h1>Jose Mourinho's plans for Tottenham contract rebels as trio head towards free agency</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld are all in the final year of their contract and can sign pre-contract agreements in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham's</a> contract rebels could yet sign new contracts at the club now that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> has left.</p>
      <p>Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen are all in the final year of their deals and could leave for free next summer.</p>
      <p>The trio are only weeks away from being able to talk to foreign clubs and sign a pre-contract agreement.</p>
      <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has been concerned about the prospect of over £100million worth of talent leaving the club for nothing.</p>
      <p>All three players, however, are understood to be intrigued by the prospect of working with serial winner Mourinho and remain open minded about their futures.</p>

      <p>Despite a string of warm tributes from his players on social media, Pochettino’s relationships with a number of his players had cooled over the past year with Kieran Trippier choosing to defect to Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho is ready to give every player at Spurs a clean slate as he bids to revive the side that reached last season’s Champions League Final.</p>
      <p>He is said to believe he can still get the best out of close friends Alderweireld and Vertonghen and Eriksen who declared at the end of last season he wanted to leave for a new challenge.</p>

      <p>Belgian pair Alderweireld and Vertonghen were both on international duty on Tuesday night when former boss Pochettino was sacked.</p>
      <p>But the duo were both at Hotspur Way on Wednesday afternoon, as Mourinho took his first session.</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently 14th in the Premier League and Mourinho is straight down to business with a London derby at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
