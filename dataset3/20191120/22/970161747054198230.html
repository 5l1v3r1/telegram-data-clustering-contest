      <p>Sian Williams has opened up about her appearance on Bill Turnbull’s documentary Staying Alive, where she spoke about living with cancer.</p>
      <p>And it turns out the most emotional moment of the film was captured when she thought the cameras had stopped rolling.</p>
      <p>The honest conversation saw both journalists in tears as they discussed the sad death of their show’s editor Alison Ford in 2013 and Williams’ own breast cancer diagnosis, which saw her undergo a double mastectomy.</p>
      <p>In the documentary, the journalist can be seen telling Turnbull that ‘even if you think [the cancer] is sorted, it comes tapping on the window.’</p>
      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk at the Channel 5 2020 showcase, on Tuesday night, the 54 year-old admitted that the conversation wasn’t initially meant to be caught on camera.</p>

      <p>‘We thought they’d turned the cameras off,’ she said: ‘They kept the cameras rolling and neither of us were sure whether to keep that bit in.</p>

      <p>‘[Bill] rang me and said, “Listen, they’re keeping the bit when we thought the cameras stopped rolling, and I think it’s okay.”‘</p>
      <p>The friends were the co-anchors of BBC Breakfast for more than a decade, but have known each other for well over 25 years.</p>
      <p>Turnbull – who was recently diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer – also discusses the after-effects of the illness with the Channel 5 newsreader, and asked if her blood is still checked monthly.</p>

      <p>Williams continued: ‘I saw it and I thought…no, it has to stay. It’s honest. It’s honest about how awful [cancer] can be and the affection between the two of us.’</p>
      <p>The storied journalist – who has been a newscaster for Channel 5 for four years now – also opened about feeling ‘well ensconced’ as a reporter for the next general election.</p>

      <p>‘Who doesn’t love a General Election campaign?’ She asked: ‘I’ve been in news for 30 years and this one is particularly…it’s different. Different to any of the others that I’ve covered.’</p>
      <p>Turnbull himself had<a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/bill-turnbull-staying-alive"> previously opened up about the documentary being a ‘blubathon’</a> ahead of its premiere on Channel 4 last month.</p>
      <p>‘I’m a bit embarrassed,’ the BBC news presenter said to Metro.co.uk and other press: ‘It’s a bit of a blubathon really. “He’s crying again!” But it’s a very emotional business.’</p>
