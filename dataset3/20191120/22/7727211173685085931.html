      <p>Coronation Street star Andrew Whyment and actor Cliff Parisi were confirmed as the late entries to the Jungle at the end of tonight's episode.</p>
      <p>The pair have been <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-im-celebrity-out-here-17272345">widely rumoured</a> to enter <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebritys-nadine-coyle-tells-17289078">I'm A Celebrity</a> and now they have been confirmed as the show's late arrivals.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec said the pair would be entering the jungle, but before they got to camp they'd be taking part in a bushtucker trial to try and win the camp dinner.</p>
      <p>The pair will become Outlaws in the Wild West! They will meet for the first time at a Bushtucker Trial in Ol' Dingo Town - a wild west style town and I'm A Celebrity's biggest trial set to date.</p>
      <p>Arriving dressed head to toe as cowboys they will each face a trial behind one of the buildings in Ol' Dingo Town. </p>
      <p>Over the coming days all Bushtucker Trials will take part in Ol' Dingo Town and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-im-celebrity-out-here-17285068">Last year</a> Noel Edmunds was the late arrival, as he lorded over the camp in his Emperor role, and left after just nine days.</p>
      <p>But this year Corrie favourite Andrew Whyment, who plays Kirk Sutherland, will be joined by former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi.</p>

      <p>When the line-up was announced, many <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/coronation-street-fans-raging-after-17241682">fans were furious that Andy was not included</a> after he was heavily rumoured to appear - but now they are sure to be thrilled.</p>
      <p>Cliff, 59, is known to millions as 'Minty' from his eight years on Albert Square and also now as handyman and gardener Fred Buckle on Call The Midwife.</p>

      <p>Cliff grew up in north London and is married to BBC production assistant Tara Wyer.</p>
      <p>He has previously spoken of how his school days were tough, because he was dyslexic but dis­­missed as “thick” and he left at 13.</p>
      <p>Unable to follow his dream of attending stage school because he lacked the necessary qualifications, Cliff became a stand-up comic.</p>
      <p>He was offered a bit-part in the 1989 film Queen of Hearts then landed the role of Lunchbox in the TV series Chancer.</p>
      <p>He also appeared in The Darling Buds of May and Drop the Dead Donkey and landed bigger parts in Kavanagh QC, Bramwell and A Prince Among Men before being cast as Minty in EastEnders in 2002.</p>
      <p>The actor has four children – daughter Mandy, 37, and sons Dean, 31, and Jack 27, are from previous relationships. Tara gave birth to the couple’s fourth child, a son named Arthur, now nine.</p>
