      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jim-cornette">Jim Cornette</a> is in the news again for all the wrong reasons as the pro wrestling veteran resigned from NWA on the back of the offensive comments he made about Trevor Murdoch during NWA Powerrr.</p>
      <p>A fan tweeted out a suggestion on Cornette's Twitter handle, proposing the idea of him possibly appearing on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> Backstage as a guest.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/paige">Paige</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/renee-young">Renee Young</a> commented on the fan's tweet and shot down any possibility of Cornette appearing on the FS1 show.</p>
      <p>While Paige responded with a casual 'Nah, we're good', Renee Young laughed off the idea and reacted with a 'hard no'.</p>

      <p>Cornette created quite a stir during the most recent episode of NWA Powerrr <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/pro-wrestling/pro-wrestling-news-jim-cornette-resigns-from-nwa-following-racist-comments">when he made some very questionable remarks</a> about Trevor Murdoch in the spur of the moment. His comments were deemed to be racist and resulted in the show being temporarily taken off the air.</p>
      <p>The legendary manager lost his NWA job in the aftermath of the entire incident as the promotion put out a statement confirming his departure.</p>
      <p>Cornette is now a free agent again and he has the option to continue voicing his opinions about the current landscape of pro wrestling on his podcasts.</p>
      <p>He returned to WWE after 12 years in 2017 to induct The Rock N' Roll Express into the WWE Hall of Fame. The outspoken 58-year-old veteran was even part of an episode of WWE's 'Table For 3' in 2018. His recent appearances make us believe that there could be a way for him to work for the WWE in some capacity again.</p>
      <p>However, if we go by the reactions of Renee Young and Paige, Cornette is certainly not a wanted man in WWE.</p>
      <p>We guess getting back CM Punk is more than enough for now.</p>
