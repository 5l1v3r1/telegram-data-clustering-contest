      <h3>Will “Jedi: Fallen Order” be on sale for Black Friday?</h3>

      <h3>Does GameStop have Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>GameStop will have a range of Black Friday deals of its own. These deals will include console deals, and game deals. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-black-friday-deals">GameStop’s deals</a> aren’t available just yet, but they will be next week.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking for the most powerful version of the Xbox, then the Xbox One X is the way to go. This console can output video at a hefty 4K, so you’ll be able to play games in stunning detail.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but this bundle comes with the highly-anticipated and already well-reviewed “Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order,” so you’ll be able to get started playing as soon as you get your console. This bundle normally costs $499.99, but it’s on sale for Black Friday for an impressive $150 off, bringing the total to $349.99.</p>

      <p>Perhaps you don’t want or need an Xbox that supports 4K – in which case, it’s worth considering the Xbox One S bundle, which also comes with “Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order.”</p>
      <p>The Xbox One S is still a very capable console and will display beautifully vivid games – even if they’re not in 4K. While the bundle normally costs $299.99, on Black Friday, you can get it for only $199.99 – $100 off the normal price.</p>

      <p>Don’t like the idea of having to buy physical copies of video games? The Xbox One S All-Digital Edition is the Xbox console for you. This console doesn’t have a disc reader at all, but the trade-off is that it’s a little cheaper than other Xbox One consoles. Safe to say, if you really only plan on buying digital copies of games anyway, this may well be the way to go. Just know that you can’t take advantage of used games.</p>
