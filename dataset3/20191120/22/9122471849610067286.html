      <h1>Popular Bowl Game Sponsor Not Renewing Its Contract</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:11:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>For the past five years the Belk Bowl has pitted the ACC against the SEC at Bank of America Stadium in North Carolina. While the bowl will likely go on, it won’t with the same name.</p>
      <p>After nearly a decade sponsoring the bowl game bearing its name, Belk will not be renewing its contract to sponsor it. As a result, the 2019 Belk Bowl will be the last one of that moniker.</p>
      <p>In addition, their contract to sponsor the annual Kickoff Game at Bank of America Stadium will also not be renewed.</p>
      <p>According to Joseph Person, Belk informed the Charlotte Sports Foundation that it would not be renewing its contract as the title sponsor for the two games.</p>

      <p>The Belk Bowl has seen a number of future NFL stars shine since it was introduced as the Queen City Bowl in 2002. Pro Bowlers Matt Schaub and Dak Prescott, along with Super Bowl winners Dion Lewis and B.J. Lewis were all MVPs of the game for their respective schools.</p>

      <p>Last year, the Virginia Cavaliers beat the favored South Carolina Gamecocks, 28-0, to claim their third Belk Bowl crown.</p>
      <p>As for the 2019 Belk Bowl, the final edition of the game under that name will be played on December 31 at 12:00 p.m. EST.</p>
      <p>We’re all gonna miss you, Belk Bowl.</p>
