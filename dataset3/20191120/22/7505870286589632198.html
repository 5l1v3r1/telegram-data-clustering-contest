      <h1>More evidence that the Galaxy S11 display will be the first of its kind for Samsung</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:33:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Meek</a></address>
      <p>We already noted <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/08/galaxy-s11-leaks-vs-iphone-12-specs-might-include-120hz-oled-screen/">earlier this month</a> that, come next year, the Galaxy S11 is expected to deliver a fantastic display experience that’s not only better than that of its predecessor, but also unlike anything ever seen up to this point on a Samsung phone. And now, thanks to a new tip from prolific leaker Ice Universe, it’s starting to look even more certain that Samsung will favor a high refresh rate screen of 120Hz for phones in the Galaxy S11 lineup.</p>
      <p>This is not to say that the Galaxy S11 would be the only 2020 smartphone to feature a high refresh rate display, which is also rumored to be <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/04/iphone-12-leaks-2020-release-date-september-best-new-feature/">coming to the iPhone 12</a>. Likewise, the Note 11 next year would surely get this same screen if Samsung does indeed decide to include a 120Hz display with the S11.</p>
      <p>As to why it’s starting to seem increasingly likely Samsung will favor this technology for the S11’s screen, that’s thanks to screenshots Ice Universe shared on Twitter Wednesday which seem to reveal a hidden option in the One UI 2.0 beta for the Galaxy Note 9:</p>

      <p>The screenshots reveal a display mode for a 120Hz screen and seem to show an option to switch between a 60Hz and 120Hz screen:</p>

      <p>Among the benefits of a 120Hz display, the animation should look twice as smooth as that on a 60Hz display. That’s something that should especially benefit the look and feel of mobile games, though gaming doesn’t seem to be talked up often as a first-order benefit of this kind of technology. For example, both OnePlus and Google launched phones this year featuring 90Hz displays, but neither the Pixel 4 or the new One Plus 7 and 7 Pro are presented as gaming devices. Meanwhile, this hint about the Galaxy S11’s screen comes on the heels of <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/07/galaxy-s11-leaks-s11e-battery-might-be-bigger-than-iphone-11-pro/">a previous S11 leak</a> revealing that the phone will include bigger batteries, which will support features like 5G connectivity and — wait for it! — high refresh rate displays.</p>
