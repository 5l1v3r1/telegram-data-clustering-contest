      <p>These pictures show a massive lorry featuring the slogan 'in the quiet lane' stuck in a narrow village road - for two days.</p>
      <p>The truck is stuck in Rock Street in the small village of Croscombe near Shepton Mallet, Somerset.</p>
      <p>Stranded on a steep hill in the rural village it appears the lorry is certainly in a tight spot with one local describing it "as well and truly stuck."</p>
      <p>One resident said this sort of incident is "a regular occurrence" on the narrow lane.</p>

      <p>Reportedly the lorry has been jammed in place since lunch time on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The truck appears to belong to British Gypsum which makes soundproof plasterboard and features the slogan: 'in the quiet lane'.</p>

      <p>Andrew Plant, @BeebJournalist, said: Chaos in Croscombe. Locals say this happens half a dozen times a year - but this is by far the biggest blockage they’ve had in their village.</p>

      <p>''The lorry came through the village yesterday following a sat nav. Now it can’t go forward - or back - and is blocking the road. Locals say it was wedged between houses at one point.''</p>
