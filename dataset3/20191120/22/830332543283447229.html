      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Gov. Tony Evers' approval rating has dropped below 50% as the first-term Democrat continues to butt heads with the Republican-controlled Legislature.</p>
      <p>The latest Marquette University Law School poll out Wednesday also shows the Legislature's approval rating has dipped.</p>
      <p>Evers' approval rating was at 57% this month, compared with 52% in October. The Legislature had a similar drop from 52% to 48%.</p>
      <p>The week before the poll was conducted, the GOP-controlled Senate voted along party lines to fire Evers' agriculture department secretary, Brad Pfaff. The pill says 47% of respondents hadn't heard anything about the move. Twenty-two percent said it was the right thing to do, while 25% said it was not.</p>
      <p>The Legislature has met fewer days and passed a fraction of the bills it did when Scott Walker was governor. Evers has also signed far fewer bills than his Democratic predecessor Jim Doyle did under divided government.</p>
