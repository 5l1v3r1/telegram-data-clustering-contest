      <p>ROBERT MORENO INSISTS he has “a clear conscience” after his stint as Spain head coach ended with Luis Enrique’s return to the role, although he acknowledged “a bittersweet feeling”.</p>
      <p>Then assistant Moreno stepped into the breach earlier this year when Luis Enrique resigned as his young daughter Xana battled bone cancer. She died in August.</p>
      <p>Former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique returned this week, however, replacing Moreno, who had worked alongside him in a number of previous positions.</p>
      <p>Moreno has not reverted to his role as assistant amid reports the two have fallen out, although he said in a statement on Wednesday he would not assess his final days as Spain boss, avoiding “a spiral of reproaches and justifications for each of the parties”.</p>
      <p>But the 42-year-old did thank Luis Enrique, his staff, the RFEF and the media, while also apologising for not addressing reporters after his final match in charge on Monday.</p>
      <p>He added in the statement: “I have a clear conscience. It is impossible to please everyone, but I sincerely tell you that I respect all and all opinions.</p>
      <p>“I have always maintained that I am a man of my word and would not be an obstacle in the event that Luis Enrique decided to return.</p>
      <p>“I have done so even though it has meant my departure. I wish him well because his joys will be ours.”</p>
      <p>Referring to the “extreme situation” in Luis Enrique’s personal life that led to him taking charge, Moreno said he wished he had never been required to become coach.</p>
      <p>He concluded: “My experience as an absolute coach began and ended in the same way, with a bittersweet feeling.</p>

      <p>“I have to look forward and face new challenges as a coach in my passion, football. I am prepared to face the challenge of leading new projects.”</p>
