      <p>As the temperatures heat up, many of us put away our automatic drip coffee machines and turn to a cooler alternative. You can pick up some excellent cold brew concentrates at your local market or coffee shop. Or, for a fraction of the price and minimal effort, you can make your own using a cold brew coffee maker.</p>
      <p>Even if the weather is freezing where you are, there are countless reasons why you might want to consider cold brew. The process produces a coffee that is less acidic and generally smoother. And, unlike hot-brewed coffee, you can store cold brew in the fridge for up to two weeks without a noticeable decline in flavor. Also, cold brew coffee makers do not require any electricity, so you can take it with you camping or just reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
      <p>If you own a French press and are not sure if you want to invest in a cold brew coffee maker yet, you can try a test batch. Use 4 ounces of water for each ounce of coarse coffee grounds. After letting the mixture sit for 12 to 24 hours, put it through a cheesecloth or paper filter. If you like the results, you are sure to enjoy the concentrate produced by cold brew coffee makers, which are much easier to clean and use.</p>
      <p>We should point out that these brewers produce a highly concentrated coffee. Therefore, you will want to dilute it with milk, water, or pour it over ice. As tempting as it may be, do not drink an entire carafe of the stuff. We’ve read enough horror stories.</p>
      <p>While researching the best cold brew coffee makers, we looked at hundreds of ratings and reviews of countless cold brewers from both experts and buyers. The ones included in our guide are durable, user-friendly, and, most importantly, produce a cold brew concentrate that is smooth and full of flavor.</p>

      <p>There are a few features that set the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JVSVM36/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=biip_112019_cyber-monday-deals-20&amp;amp;linkId=6513728a9f36036c73d98370985d8963&amp;amp;language=en_US">OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker</a> apart from the rest of the cold brewers on this list. First, there is a unique perforated “rainmaker” top that helps distribute the water evenly over the coffee grounds, which is key for optimal flavor extraction. Also, rather than using a stopper or plug at the bottom of the coffee bowl, there is a valve that is easy to turn on and off.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JVSVM36/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=biip_112019_cyber-monday-deals-20&amp;amp;linkId=6513728a9f36036c73d98370985d8963&amp;amp;language=en_US">OXO cold brew maker</a> features a fine, stainless steel mesh filter that you can reuse, though you may still want to use a paper filter for easier cleanup. The carafe is made of borosilicate glass, which is quite resilient since it does not expand or contract like normal glass. The carafe is shaped like an Erlenmeyer flask, which is sure to appeal to science fans. Lastly, this OXO gadget can produce up to 32 ounces of cold brew at a time.</p>
      <p>Insider Picks Senior Editor Malarie Gokey uses the OXO cold brew maker in her own kitchen every day during the hot summer months when hot coffee just isn’t appealing. It’s incredibly easy to use because you don’t have to worry about any filters or small parts.</p>
      <p>The simple design is incredibly smart. You just ensure that the release valve is locked, add the amount of coffee you want to use, pop the rainmaker top on, and pour the right amount of water over the grounds in a circular motion. The water will rain down on the grounds and get brewing.</p>
      <p>In our tests, we let it brew for 12 to 24 hours, depending on the flavor we wanted. When it’s done brewing, you just flip the release valve and watch the coffee pour down into the carafe. Perhaps best of all, OXO includes a secure stopper for the top of the carafe, so you can just pop it on and put the entire carafe in the fridge.</p>
      <p>The machine turned out excellent cold brew every time we used it. It does take some trial and error to get the flavor you want, but OXO’s guidelines give you a good idea of where to get started. We recommend experimenting with different kinds of coffee to see which flavors and strengths you like. We were particularly fond of a fruity Colombian blend a family friend gifted us because it almost tasted like chocolate milk when we made cold brew with it.</p>
      <p>The machine is remarkably easy to clean after, too. You just scoop the grounds into the trash and rinse it out. The OXO cold brew machine makes brewing coffee an incredibly simple and effortless experience.</p>
      <p>Other expert reviewers also rate the OXO machine highly. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/review-oxo-cold-brew-coffee/">Wired</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/oxo-cold-brew-coffee-maker/2/">CNET</a>, and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-cold-brew-coffee-maker/">The Wirecutter</a> all recommend it.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Stylish design, easy to store, convenient valve for pouring</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Relatively expensive</p>

      <p>Cornell chemical engineer graduate Todd Simpson developed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_041918_best-cold-brew-coffee-makers-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0006H0JVW&amp;amp;linkId=e389e4cd4e138fb4b83ec6aeb3ed7a3a">Toddy Cold Brew System</a> in 1964. The system includes a brewing container with a handle, two reusable filters, a rubber stopper, a glass decanter with a lid, a recipe guide, and instructions. The filters are designed to last for three months or up to 12 uses, whichever comes first.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/blog/2016/07/11/crew-review-toddy-cold-brew-system/">Seattle Coffee Gear</a> recommends the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_041918_best-cold-brew-coffee-makers-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0006H0JVW&amp;amp;linkId=e389e4cd4e138fb4b83ec6aeb3ed7a3a">Toddy Cold Brew System</a> because of its design and ease of use. The reviewer found that a single filter did an excellent job of trapping bitter acids for up to a dozen uses and liked the smooth taste of the concentrate.</p>

Up to 8 ounces of coffee grounds are added to the filter, which is then screwed into the pitcher, which holds 32 ounces of water. Rather than removing a plug or opening a valve to release the cold brew, you remove the filter and grounds from the water. This leaves you with a pitcher of cold brew concentrate.</p>
      <p>Since the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FFLY64U/ref=as_li_tl?imprToken=j215dfdGB1wRSGBkI5udKw&amp;amp;slotNum=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_041918_best-cold-brew-coffee-makers-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=w61&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00FFLY64U&amp;amp;linkId=7858d46bb35c2a9e618575e7fd95b308">Takeya brewer</a> uses half the grounds to produce the same amount of cold brew as the makers we’ve already mentioned, the resulting concentrate is decidedly weaker. Yet, this may not be a problem since most people dilute their cold brew anyway.</p>

He likes the price, but it’s the convenience that he appreciates: Simply dump the coffee grounds into the filter (a medium or dark roast ground coarse works best), add cold filtered water, place in the fridge overnight, and you have cold brew coffee waiting the next morning.</p>
      <p>To counter the weakness that many reviewers mentioned, he strongly shakes the bottle for 30 seconds before placing it in the fridge – this is where the leak-proof cap comes in handy – which leads to a much stronger-tasting concentrate. Then, he lets it brew for at least 12 hours. The fine mesh of the built-in filter does a good job keeping the grounds from getting into the concentrate. The pitcher also makes it handy for pouring (pro tip: try making coffee ice cubes).</p>
      <p>The filter can be a bit difficult to clean and over time, it will discolor and could take on the taste of a particular coffee. That being said, it’s not a real issue for most people, and Takeya sells replacement filters.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Affordable, fits in your refrigerator door, does not require paper filters, easy to use</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> May not satisfy people who like strong coffee</p>

      <p>At first glance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VPXEBU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_041918_best-cold-brew-coffee-makers-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001VPXEBU&amp;amp;linkId=1875c36433fb80353771ef5e65110a23">Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Iced Coffee Pot</a> appears to be just like the Takeya brewer. They both use a process where the filter – full of coffee grounds – is removed from the water after steeping. However, the Hario Mizudashi has a filter that requires fewer grounds to fill (about 2.8 ounces). And, you slowly pour water over the grounds and stir the mixture to start the brewing process. The Hario maker has a glass container versus the plastic of the Takeya.</p>
      <p>Hario recommends letting the coffee steep for eight hours, but our research found that this produces a weak concentration. Instead, for a stronger cup of joe, consider brewing the coffee for 12 to 24 hours, like most other cold brew coffee makers.</p>

If you’re impatient and never plan ahead, you may want to try a fast-brewing cold brew machine like this one from <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_041918_best-cold-brew-coffee-makers/https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/cuisinart-reg-cold-brew-coffee-maker/1061757110">Cuisinart</a>.</p>
      <p>We tried it out at home, and though it didn’t produce cold brew that was as aromatic and flavorful as our OXO, the coffee it did produce was still delicious and it was ready in just 25 to 45 minutes as opposed to 12 to 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The machine is easy to use, though it does require electricity. You simply add ground coffee to the filter basket and fill the water tank with cold or room temperature water. It will take some time to figure out how much water and coffee you want to use, but Cuisinart has very clear guidelines that worked well enough for our tastes.</p>
      <p>The machine has three different coffee strengths, each of which corresponds to a different brew time: mild (25 minutes), medium (35 minutes), and bold (45 minutes). Once you’ve chosen your strength, you press “brew” to begin. The coffee filter basket spins to agitate the grounds and the water and speed up the extraction process.</p>
      <p>Once it’s done brewing, you slide the lever to the release the coffee into the carafe below. The carafe also has a filter top, so you shouldn’t get too much sediment in your cup, though you will see some as you reach the end of the carafe. Some people hate this and say it tastes “dirty,” but others don’t seem to mind.</p>
      <p>We thought the Cuisinart Cold Brew Coffeemaker did best on the bold setting, which makes sense because it’s the longest period of extraction. Keep in mind that it’s not true cold brew because you simply can’t beat a good, long extraction time with this type of brewing. Still, for cold brew in less than an hour, this is the best machine you can buy.</p>
      <p>The main concern we had was that the machine has moving parts, so it is more at risk of breaking than the other cold brew makers we recommend, all of which require no electricity. <i>– Malarie Gokey</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros: </b>Fast brewing process, easy to use, effective, good flavor</p>
      <p><b>Cons: </b>Moving parts risk failure, needs electricity, cold brew purists may not like the speedy extraction time</p>

      <h4>The <a href="https://www.filtron.com/Filtron-30L-Cold-Water-Coffee-Concentrate-Brewing-System_p_8.html">Filtron Cold Water Coffee Concentrate Brewer</a> produces remarkably rich, sediment-free cold brew, thanks to its multi-chamber filter system.</h4>
      <p>What sets the <a href="https://www.filtron.com/Filtron-30L-Cold-Water-Coffee-Concentrate-Brewing-System_p_8.html">Filtron Cold Water Coffee Concentrate Brewer</a> apart from other brewing systems is its use of a water bowl. This system evenly saturates the coffee grounds to draw out the flavors of the beans and make delicious coffee.</p>
      <p>To use the brewer, you first plug the bottom of the coffee bowl and insert the reusable sealed filter. For easy cleanup, insert a large coffee filter on top of that and fill it with up to a pound of ground coffee. Next, place the plastic guard on the coffee and put the water bowl on top. You then fill the water bowl to the appropriate level and let the coffee steep for 12 to 24 hours. Lastly, you place the setup over the 1.5-liter carafe and pull the plug.</p>
      <p>We admit, the Filtron requires a bit of work, but you’ll be rewarded with great tasting cold brew coffee for the effort.</p>
      <p>The Filtron Brewer comes with two sample paper filters and a measuring cup. One unique and somewhat irritating feature is that the reusable filter pad must be stored in the refrigerator in water to stave off mold.</p>
      <p>Product reviewers and buyers alike agree that this cold brew coffee maker is excellent. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/filtron-cold-water-coffee-brewer/review/">CNET</a> praises the <a href="https://www.filtron.com/Filtron-30L-Cold-Water-Coffee-Concentrate-Brewing-System_p_8.html">Filtron Cold Water Coffee Concentrate Brewer</a> because of the rich and delicious quality of the coffee it produces. As for downsides, the reviewer found that the Filtron was more difficult to use than others because of the multi-chamber filter. Still, the reviewer recommends it as an affordable, effective cold brew option.</p>
      <p>Of the half-dozen cold brew systems <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-cold-brew-coffee-maker/">The Wirecutter</a> tested, the Filtron brewer consistently supplied the best-tasting concentrate. The reviewer also found that the brewer produced the least expensive cold brew per cup. However, the writer noted that it is more cumbersome to replenish its supplies and to store it. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-cold-brew-coffee-makers/">Wired</a> thought the Filtron “makes rich, full-bodied cold-brewed coffee that has the least sediment of any product” it tested, but like CNET’s review, it found the process a bit involved.</p>
      <p>An important perk: you don’t need to buy Filtron-specific filters. Standard large coffee filters work fine with this cold brew maker.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Takes many different filters, produces rich and delicious coffee at a low cost per cup</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Hard to store, difficult to use at first</p>
