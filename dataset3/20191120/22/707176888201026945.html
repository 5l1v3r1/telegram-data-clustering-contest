      <h2>Largest deal in payment company’s history as it expands beyond its core business</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:19:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:19</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Waters</a></address>
      <p>PayPal on Wednesday unveiled its most ambitious attempt yet to move beyond its core payments business, as it announced the $4bn acquisition of deal-finding company Honey. </p>
      <p>The purchase — the biggest in PayPal’s history — will bring the company a new source of data and insights into online shopping behaviour, paving the way for it to reach deeper into online purchases and offer a wider range of services to consumers and merchants. </p>
      <p>The acquisition comes as the online payments company faces a new wave of competition from internet giants such as Apple and Google, leading it to search for new ways to cement its ties with customers and become more useful to merchants. </p>
      <p>Honey's online tools, which include a Google Chrome browser extension, are used to track prices and save consumers money by automatically applying coupons and offers when they are looking to make a purchase.</p>
      <p>The company makes money by charging a commission to merchants on completed sales.</p>
      <p>PayPal said it planned to extend the service from Honey's current 17m users to the nearly 300m people who use PayPal and Venmo, its person-to-person payments network. </p>
      <p>It also said it would extend Honey’s services for merchants, now used by 30,000 businesses, to the 24m merchants who accept PayPal. These include the ability to target personalised offers at consumers who create lists of products they want to buy on Honey.</p>
      <p>“This acquisition has the potential to be transformative for us,” Dan Schulman, PayPal’s chief executive, said. “We think this moves us up in the entire shopping process,” rather than limiting PayPal’s connection to users to the checkout page of ecommerce sites.</p>

      <p>Mr Schulman said the deal was mainly motivated by the chance to develop a deeper relationship with consumers, but he added: “We think this starts to position us with merchants that combines shopping, offers, payments together in integrated solutions.”</p>
      <p>The acquisition may also mark the biggest-ever acquisition of a venture capital-backed company from Los Angeles. Honey was founded there in 2012 and, according to Crunchbase, has raised only $32m on the road to profitability. Its revenues grew by more than 100 per cent last year to $100m and it also returned a profit, Mr Schulman said. </p>
      <p>PayPal said it would pay for the acquisition out of its existing cash reserves, which stood at $5.5bn net of debt at the end of September. Its shares fell 2 per cent to about $102 each in after-market trading following the announcement.</p>
