      <h1>This is the one good prank on the internet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:49:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/morgan-sung/" target="_blank">Morgan Sung</a></address>
      <p>I regret to inform you that there is, in fact, One Good Prank on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Look, we can all agree that among the petfluencer momagers and the vloggers who manufacture drama for views, prank accounts are Instagram's most insufferable group. They're notorious for objectifying women, shouting a lot, and possibly gaslighting their romantic partners for the sake of a good prank. </p>
      <p>But viral prankster Goubran Bahou may have actually pulled off a good one — his latest video posted to Instagram and TikTok is a perfect summary of the human condition. </p>
      <p>In the video, Bahou sprints away from some unknown force to an aria from the Italian opera <i>Pagliacci</i>. Puzzled bystanders watch him speed around the corner, frantically pumping his arms as if he's running for his life. Then as the music swells, someone in a wearable dinosaur puppet rounds the corner as well, terrifying bystanders. </p>
      <p>Some manage to turn and run. Others just hit the ground. Caught in glorious slow motion, they all share the same expression of pure terror. </p>

      <p>This may just be Bahou's greatest work yet. </p>
