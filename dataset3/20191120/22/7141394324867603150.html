      <h1>Crypto Fake-Out? Bitcoin (BTC) Burst to $14,500 Likely As Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin Look for Turnaround: Joe Saz</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:17:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Joe Saz is mapping out the short and medium-term possibilities for Bitcoin and the altcoin market.</p>
      <p>The technical analyst and Bitcoin maximalist tells <a href="https://blocktv.com/watch/2019-11-20/5dd56772f043a-when-can-we-expect-the-bitcoin-halvening-pump-">BlockTV</a> he thinks Bitcoin’s sudden move from around $7,500 to $9,900 in late October shifted the overall trend of the leading cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>He’s now looking for BTC to stage a fake-out and once again shift to the upside, reaching $14,500 in the next six months.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We had a nasty pump again that might have shaken us out of a bear market. And I do think that the halving is going to be its own separate entity six months from now. I just don’t think the market is going to remember all this the same way that a traditional asset would…</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I think that volatility is why I say its memory is very short, a short time frame. To me, this is a different cycle. The breakdown from the descending triangle was the bear market. The pump saved us from a bear market. And we [also] had a pump save us from a bear market on April 2nd.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>So I have no reason to believe that we can’t be at $14,000 Bitcoin, $14,500 by the halving. I really think that’s a strong possibility. If we were to not have had that pump, I probably would have said $8,000 at the halving.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>According to Saz, Ethereum and Litecoin appear poised for a short-term turnaround.</p>
      <p>But he warns that in the volatile and risky crypto market, anything can happen and traders should do their own research and ensure they are managing risk properly.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Litecoin is one of the coins that people often say leads the charge, so I’m ok with hearing that.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And I think it’s possible we could have a little bounce here in the altcoin space. If I was to use alts as an indicator it would have to be Litecoin and Ethereum.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Saz is a longtime skeptic of XRP and the crypto payments company Ripple.</p>
      <p>He believes the chart for the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap remains bearish.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We’re still a penny, two pennies away from entering this wick space. It is looking bearish. We did seem to have a little bit of relief for a single day, but that seems to have been crushed already with the bearish engulfing candle.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We’re still 11 hours out from the daily close. So XRP is still looking bearish to me into this wick space.”</i>
