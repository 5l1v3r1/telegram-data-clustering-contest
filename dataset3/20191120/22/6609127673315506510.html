      <p>But Fraser Forster believes the crowning moment of his career thus far came during <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic’s</a> 2-1 win over Lazio last month.</p>
      <p>With Parkhead rocking, the towering keeper produced <b>TWO</b> world-class late saves to help secure a vital Europa League victory for Neil Lennon’s men.</p>
      <p>After 18 months of hell at St Mary’s, it felt like heaven being back in Paradise.</p>
      <p>Forster reflected: “I actually thought the save before the one everyone was talking about was the better save.</p>

      <p>“For me, given the circumstances and the timing in the game — it was pretty much the last kick — everything around it made it a bigger save than it was. It’s nice to make them.</p>
      <p>“When you chat about appreciating playing again and whatever, that moment is up there with the best in my career.</p>
      <p>“Off the back of the previous 18 months, it was a moment when you think, ‘That’s why you play football’.</p>
      <p>“Given the 18 months before, stuff I’d had to deal with, that was probably the first moment when I fully realised what I’d been missing.</p>
      <p>"It’s impossible to say how good that feeling is. Just adrenaline, relief, a feeling you are back.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to describe how it is. It’s like when a striker is asked how it feels to score. You don’t get that feeling in any other aspect of life.</p>
      <p>“Just given the previous 18 months, to have that feeling back was something very special.</p>
      <p>“If I could pick one feeling out of my whole career, that would probably be the moment I appreciate the most.</p>

      <p>“I always knew I could play at this level, but just as a one-off feeling, having not played then to come back and be playing, you know 100 per cent you’ve done the right thing. What a feeling.”</p>
      <p>Forster is edging back to the kind of form that saw him named in England’s 2014 World Cup squad and Euro 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>Under the guidance of goalkeeping mentor Stevie Woods, the 31-year-old is rebuilding his confidence and reputation as a top-class keeper.</p>
      <p>He added: “I don’t know what it is about the place, there are a lot of good people at the club.</p>
      <p>“I work with a lot of good people. The manager has been brilliant with me and I am working with a great goalkeeping coach in Stevie Woods.</p>
      <p>“I just love being here, I just enjoy it. Stevie understands players. His sessions are great but I think he understands the mental side of the game too.</p>
      <p>“He knows what makes each player tick. He’s worked with some incredible keepers during his time here.</p>
      <p>“He has a fantastic record. He just knows how to get the best out of the players he’s working with — and he’s definitely up there with the best I have worked with.</p>

      <p>“He took me from a League One keeper and turned me into an England international.</p>
      <p>“He is always there, he is always willing to work with you and nothing is ever too much trouble for him.</p>
      <p>“He’s fantastic to have around and I have been very fortunate to spend a lot of my career working with him.</p>
      <p>“He does a lot of work on the opposition too, he’s very thorough in what he does, he’s a great sounding board and he’s always there for me.</p>
      <p>“I am just happy at the moment, I am enjoying my football again.</p>
      <p>"It’s like anything in life, if you feel a bit of love and you enjoy going to work, it’s going to bring more out of you. I’m enjoying my time here.”</p>
      <p>Forster, who was on hand to help promote the return of the Celtic Festival, has ruled out a return to the Premier League in January.</p>
      <p>He stressed: “It’s a season-long loan and I’ll be here until the end of the season.</p>

      <p>"I have not spoken to anyone at Southampton since I came up here. That’s just how football works.</p>
      <p>“I’m up here, I’m a Celtic player for the year and that’s fine. I just want to do as well for this club as I can.</p>
      <p>“Last year is the first year that I have ever had like that in football.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t take everything previous to it for granted, but when you go from playing to not playing you don’t have a game to look forward to.</p>
      <p>“You are training but you don’t have that focus of who you are playing at the weekend.</p>
      <p>“It is great to have that feeling back and that drive. I’m making the most of it and enjoying every minute.”</p>
      <p>Celtic host <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/362848/livingston/">Livingston</a> on Saturday determined to avenge their only league defeat of the season.</p>
      <p>Gary Holt’s men stunned the champions 2-0 last month and Forster admitted: “It was a disappointing performance and result when we played them at their place, but now it’s just important we win.</p>
      <p>“We have learned from that and we had a good reaction in the last month. It’s important we hit the ground running in this next chunk of games.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about owing them one, we just have to play to the standard we know we can play at. If we do that I’m confident we can get the points.”</p>
