      <h1>Doctor Who makes up for no Christmas special with amazing series 12 guest stars</h1>

      <p>Sir Lenny Henry and Stephen Fry will be special guest stars in Doctor Who series 12.</p>
      <p>When Jodie Whittaker’s Time Lord travels the universe once again next year, she is set to meet the actors along the way.</p>
      <p>Their characters are being kept under wraps for now – so will they be friend or foe? Either is fine with us!</p>
      <p>Stephen said: ‘Short of being picked for a British space exploration programme and I readily concede that I’m past the age where I’d be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting) – then being in an episode of Doctor Who will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement.’</p>
      <p>Sir Lenny, equally excited, added: ‘It was absolutely brilliant to be welcomed into the fantastical world of Doctor Who. The nearest I have been to the TARDIS was when I played the Caribbean Doctor in the Lenny Henry Show , so as a life-long (hiding behind the sofa type) Doctor Who fan this is a very special moment for me.’</p>

      <p>Showrunner Chris Chibnall said he is buzzing to be working with ‘two of my absolute favourite actors’.</p>
      <p>‘Doctor Who is coming back with a bang – with two great British icons in major roles,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘One of the great joys of Doctor Who is getting to work with actors from your wish list. Stephen and Lenny are two of my absolute favourite actors – and to be able to bring them into Doctor Who, in our one of our biggest ever stories to kick off the new series, is an absolute thrill.’</p>
