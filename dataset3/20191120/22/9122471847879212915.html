      <h1>Breaking: NCAA Announces Ruling On Memphis Star James Wiseman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:21:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The NCAA has finally decided how many games it will suspend James Wiseman for the financial help he received from Penny Hardaway.</p>
      <p>Roughly two weeks ago, the college basketball world was struck with stunning news as Wiseman was <a href="https://thespun.com/aac/memphis/james-wiseman-ineligible-for-season-memphis-penny-hardaway">ruled ineligible to play</a>. He managed to play in two more games because of an emergency temporary restraining order.</p>
      <p>Following those two contests, the five-star freshman decided to withdraw his lawsuit against the NCAA regarding his eligibility status.</p>
      <p>Wiseman withdrew his lawsuit in hopes that it would help speed up the NCAA’s decision. Clearly that worked out in his favor.</p>
      <p>The NCAA released the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>“James Wiseman, a freshman on the University of Memphis men’s basketball team, must sit 11 additional games (12 total) based on recruiting inducements his family received before he enrolled at Memphis and for competing in three games while ineligible.”</blockquote>
      <p>Wiseman will be cleared to play by Jan. 12, when the Tigers take on the South Florida Bulls.</p>

      <p>The NCAA also announced that Wiseman must donate $11,500 to a charity of his choice.</p>
      <p>Although the Tigers will have to find ways to win without their best player over the next two months, the fact that they’ll have Wiseman for the majority of their conference schedule helps ease the sting of losing him right now.</p>
      <p>Wiseman now has plenty of time to prove to scouts that he could be the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft.</p>
      <p>Memphis will have to move past this dilemma and shift focus to tonight’s contest against Little Rock.</p>
