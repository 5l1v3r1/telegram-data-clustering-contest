      <p>Major League Baseball’s official game, and the only MLB game for Xbox One, returns next year with <i>RBI Baseball 20</i>, with developers promising a makeover in its hitting and pitching systems, plus an update to ball physics and fielder AI.</p>
      <p>A launch date was not given. Typically the game launches in March. <i>RBI Baseball 20 </i>will be released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Android and iOS mobile devices.</p>
      <p>Christian Yelich of the Milwaukee Brewers, the 2018 National League MVP, is the game’s cover star, although the $29.99 game is more frequently bought online. MLB used today’s announcement to tout the Brewers’ new uniforms, which celebrates the franchise’s 50th anniversary in Milwaukee with a classic design and the ball-and-glove MB logo made famous by the 1982 American League champions.</p>
      <p>MLB resurrected RBI Baseball in 2014 with <i>RBI Baseball 14</i>, as a modern console revival of the arcade-style gameplay remembered from the Nintendo Entertainment System classic. The game is developed by the MLB Games and VR Team, a unit of MLB Advanced Media, making Major League Baseball the only league that produces its own video game.</p>
