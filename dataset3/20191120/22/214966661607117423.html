      <h1>Prince Andrew steps back from public duties </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:37:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/mstclair/" target="_blank">Monique StClair</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew has stepped down from Royal duties, as the fall-out from his disastrous tell-all interview continues.</p>
      <p>He’s asked his mother – the Queen – to step back from public duties, saying his association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a ‘major disruption’ to the royal family.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear exactly how long he’ll stay away from the public eye.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has also said that he would be “willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”</p>
      <p>His full statement reads:</p>
      <p>“It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</p>
      <p>“I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>“His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>“I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required,” the statement reads.</p>
