      <h1>Daniel Stendel 'top Hearts target' as Austin MacPhee is set for new role at Tynecastle</h1>
      <h2>The German left his role as Barnsley manager earlier this season and has been interviewed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:45:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Daniel Stendel has reportedly been identified as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> ' number one target for the vacant head coach role.</p>
      <p>The German was sacked as Barnsley boss earlier this season and has already been interviewed for the position, which has been vacant since <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> was sacked.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4977772/hearts-daniel-stendel-ann-budge-austin-macphee/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574289155">Sun</a> owner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> has identified Stendel has the top target to replace the former Scotland boss and is prepared to push the boat out financially to get him.</p>
      <p>Stendel is still under contract with Barnsley and is on gardening leave, so the Jambos would have to pay compensation to bring him to Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Budge has previously stated that would not be an issue if the right man were to be identified.</p>
      <p>She said earlier this month: "We have to compete with the top clubs in Scotland and to do that we want a very experienced and high profile manager.</p>
      <p>"Finances (to pay compensation) are not a problem."</p>
      <p>Up to six figures could be required to extricate Stendel from his contract, and it remains to be seen if he will accept the job.</p>

      <p>It's also reported that current interim boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/austin-macphee">Austin MacPhee</a> will move upstairs to become the new sporting director at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>Levein previously acted as both head coach and director of football, but Hearts are looking to shake up the existing structure.</p>
      <p>MacPhee will be in the dugout for Saturday's game at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> but could be appointed to the newly-created sporting director role after that.</p>
