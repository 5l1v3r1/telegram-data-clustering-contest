      <h1>Prince Andrew set to step back from public duties over BBC Newsnight 'disaster' interview</h1>
      <h2>Pressure has been mounting in recent days over the royal role of the Queen's second son after his high-profile interview about his links with the disgraced financier</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:56:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>The Duke of York will step back from public duties for the "foreseeable future" amid widespread criticism over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Pressure has been mounting in recent days over the royal role of the Queen's second son after his high-profile interview about his links with the disgraced financier.</p>
      <p>Firms including telecoms giant BT and bank Barclays are among a number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities which have distanced themselves from Andrew in the wake of the BBC interview.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Andrew said: "It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency."</p>
