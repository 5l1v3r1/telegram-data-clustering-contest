      <p>Ten 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have qualified for the fifth Democratic primary debate, which MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host tonight, November 20, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <p>While twelve candidates shared a crowded stage in the October 15 debate, fewer candidates qualified for the next round.</p>
      <p>In order to qualify for the November debate, candidates need both 165,000 individual donors and to earn either 3% in four DNC-approved national polls or 5% in two approved early-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada.</p>
      <p>Polls released between September 13 and November 13 – the week before the debate – counted towards qualification.</p>
      <p>The field is now narrowing down, with multiple lower-tier candidates dropping out of the race after failing to meet the debate requirements, running out of money, or both.</p>
