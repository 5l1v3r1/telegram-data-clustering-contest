      <h3>Next week, city council will decide whether to allow the Saskatoon Public Library to borrow $87.5 million to build a new downtown location.</h3>
      <p>The library’s leadership wants to make sure residents understand how the cost will affect them.</p>
      <p>Library director Carol Cooley and board chair Lisa Erickson met with The StarPhoenix on Wednesday to dispel some of the misconceptions about the proposed $154-million project.</p>
      <p>Cooley and Erickson noted it will only cost the owners of a home with an assessed value of $371,000 about $5 more in each of the next seven years to pay for the project, despite the high price tag.</p>
      <p>“Overwhelmingly, folks are surprised that it can only cost a household $5 a year from 2020 to 2026 to get a brand new library,” Erickson said.</p>
      <p>Cooley noted that the library levy has been increased for about 10 years in anticipation of the need for a new building to replace the 53-year-old Frances Morrison Central Library.</p>
      <p>Residents may not have noticed the increases because the library’s portion only represents six per cent of the total property tax bill, they pointed out.</p>
      <p>For 2020, the proposed increase amounts to 2.57 per cent, but that’s not the same as a similar increase for the city’s portion of the property tax. The city’s proposed property tax increase of 3.23 per cent in 2020 would mean an increase of $60.95 for a house with an assessed value of $371,000.</p>
      <p>“Unpacking this is so important because it’s complicated,” Erickson said.</p>
      <p>They also noted that the cost of the proposed 149,000-square-foot facility includes a $24-million contingency. If the project proceeds as planned, that contingency will not be spent.</p>
      <p>Erickson and Cooley said they also expect donations to exceed the $15-million goal and have budgeted conservatively for the amount they expect to get for the sale of the current building.</p>
      <p>Coun. Troy Davies has signalled that he intends to trigger a vote next week asking for the library board to resubmit their plan with a “significantly less expensive and smaller facility.”</p>
      <p>Erickson and Cooley responded that they have heard that council members, including Davies, understand the need for a new central library. The pair said they will wait to see what council decides before responding further.</p>
      <p>Davies also expressed concern that he has yet to see a proposed design for the building. Erickson explained the library board wants to consult residents about the design.</p>
      <p>“I completely understand why people are craving a design,” she said. “I am, too.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, the downtown library had 490,880 visits and loaned out 562,382 items.</p>
