      <h1>Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Jonas Brothers And More Nominated For Best Pop Duo Or Group Performance Grammy Award</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:35:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>The nominees for the 62nd Grammy Awards are in and there are some surprising nominations in the Best Pop Duo/Group category. Lil Nas X has come in as one of the biggest nominees with six nominations and in addition to being nominated for Best New Artist, Record, and Album of the Year, he is also up for Best Pop Duo/Group for his collaboration with Billy Ray Cyrus on “Old Town Road.”</p>
      <p>Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus are an early favorite though they are facing some intense competition and at this point, anyone could take home the golden gramophone statue and for the nominees, many feel it is an honor simply to be in the running. Additionally, Billy Ray’s three nominations with Lil Nas X bring his total Grammy nominations to 7. He hasn’t won yet and many of his fans would like to see him take home a Grammy.</p>
      <p>The full list of Grammy nominations for Best Pop Duo/Group is as follows.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>“Boyfriend” by Ariana Grande and Social House</li>
        <li>“Sucker” by Jonas Brothers</li>
        <li>“Old Town Road” by Lil Nas x featuring Billy Ray Cyrus</li>
        <li>“Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee</li>
        <li>“Senorita” by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Fans are speaking out about the nominees and who they want to win. Though there is a lot of support for Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello are also seeing a lot of their fans speaking out on social media platforms.</p>
      <p>Neither Shawn Mendes or Camila Cabello have won a Grammy and as they have been nominated for the duet that is credited with bringing them together as a couple, many find it would simply be romantic if they won.</p>
      <p>In addition to Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello, the Jonas Brothers have a lot of support for the win as they too have yet to win a Grammy.</p>
      <p>Post Malone and Swae Lee are also getting a lot of social media support. Post Malone has six nominations yet hasn’t won a Grammy. Swae Lee has five Grammy nominations and no wins.</p>
      <p>What do you think about the nominations for Best Pop Duo/Group? Who do you think should win the Grammy award?</p>
