      <p>A female rock fan, 27, has been left "scarred for life" after she was badly burnt by a flare launched into the crowd at a packed Liam Gallagher concert.</p>
      <p>Stacey Andrew was near the front of the stage when she was struck by the lit projectile, which ignited her clothing and burned her skin underneath.</p>
      <p>She was rushed from the venue, the FlyDSA Arena in Sheffield, South Yorks, with severe burns to her chest and arms as well as damage to her hair.</p>
      <p>The identity of the individual who threw the flare is not known, but they are thought to have been located further back in the crowd.</p>

      <p>A number of other concertgoers have taken to social media to say there were lots of flares set alight in the crowd throughout the concert on Monday.</p>
      <p>Stacey's brother Leon has appealed for help to catch those responsible, who he claimed "could have taken my sister away from me and my family".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a Facebook post shared with Gallagher, Leon wrote: "Anyone who has information on the scumbag who decided to light a flare and throw it into the crowd and set my sister on fire I want his name or information on him because he needs to pay for what he has done."</p>
      <p>Leon said he was at home when he got a call to say his sister, who's from Boston, Lincs, was in hospital.</p>
      <p>"She will be scarred for the rest of her life," he said.</p>

      <p>"All I’ve been trying to do is post everywhere I can on social media to find out who did it.</p>
      <p>"Those flares shouldn’t of been in there."</p>
      <p>He added: “I want justice for the pain they have caused my sister because she will now have scars for the rest of her life.”</p>
