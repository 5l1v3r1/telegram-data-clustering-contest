      <h1>DJ Premier Accused Of Jacking Guru Song For New Gang Starr Album: “He’s Trying To Make Money Off A Song He Knows Was Stolen”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:35:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author">Cyrus Langhorne</a></address>
      <p>Rap pioneer <b>DJ Premier</b> has some explaining to do. East Coast hip-hop artist <b>Fong Sai U</b> has accused the iconic producer of using one of his songs for an unauthorized <b>Gang Starr</b> song off the newly released <i>One of the Best Yet</i> album.</p>
      <p>According to the hip-hop veteran, Premo illegally purchased Fong’s “What’s Real” 2015 song from an outside source, kept the title and hook for this year’s Gang Starr project.</p>
      <blockquote>“[Guru collaborator] <b>Solar</b> sold DJ Premier my song with Guru – ‘What’s Real’ –  a song that I previously put out in 2015 on my <i>Ballads of a Massacre</i> album and own the rights for. Between 2000 and 2001 me and Guru worked a lot. I produced “OG Talk” on 2001’s <i>Baldhead Slick &amp; da Click</i> album under my other alias <b>Divine</b>. The only other person that was around was <b>Phat Gary</b>, Guru’s road manager at the time. That f*ck boy Solar wasn’t in the picture until 2005 after alerting DJ Premier of the situation. He made a BS offer instead of owning up to his mistake. He let devil Solar pull a fast one on him again. The sad part about all this is Solar is still out here causing confusion.” (SOHH)</blockquote>
      <p>Fong Sai also shared deep words to the memory of his late collaborator and said Premo has to ultimately rectify the situation.</p>
      <blockquote>“I wish Guru could just rest but what’s right is right and wrong is wrong and DJ Premier is trying to make money off a song he know was stolen and to keep promoting the album like he has no idea he stole a song and changed the beat. That hook is my concept. The majority of what Guru is spitting, mine. This is Guru before he became sober and a lot of times it was hard for him to pen sh*t because of the alcohol but that’s my brother and the only one that gave my production a chance so in my eyes he can do no wrong. But Premier has to make it right. Period. That very was very sentimental to me because that’s a memory that can’t be replaced.” (SOHH)</blockquote>

      <p>Gang Starr <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/gang-star-one-of-the-best-yet-review-907757/">is most known</a> for putting out memorable 90’s tunes.</p>
      <blockquote>On six albums released between 1989 and 2003, Gang Starr were the platonic ideal of rap music, the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hip-hop/">hip-hop</a> version of rock groups like Aerosmith or ZZ Top. Other groups had bigger hits, more iconic songs, more critically adored albums and bolder presences, but Premo and Guru represented the absolute <i>essence</i> of a genre. Unwavering in their dedication, consistent in their output, virtuosic but never flashy, Gang Star were skilled technicians of all the things hip-hop purists stand for: “boom bap,” “real hip-hop,” “that old New York rap,” cuts, beats, rhymes, life. (Rolling Stone)</blockquote>
