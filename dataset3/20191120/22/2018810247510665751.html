      <p>You are looking at the cartridge art for <i>Street Fighter II Turbo</i>’s Japanese release. It’s not only different from <a href="https://www.vinjatvideogames.com/es/snes-street_fighter_ii_turbo_ntsc_cart">the US version</a> but more mysterious. Can you tell who is on the cover? Ryu? Chun-Li? Which character is it?</p>
      <p>Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/tekitouaki">Tekitouaki</a> wrote that for years, he thought that Ryu was on the cover.</p>

      <p>This tweet went viral in Japan and was even covered on major sites like <a href="https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1911/20/news071.html"><i>IT Media</i> </a>and <i>My Game News Flash</i>. People replied, comparing eyebrows and writing that they were either “Team Chun-Li” or “Team Ryu.”</p>

      <p>Former Capcom artist Akira Yasuda, <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/10/capcom-wouldnt-be-capcom-without-akimans-amazing-art">who created</a> so much iconic <i>Street Fighter</i> art, even chimed in, writing, “I’d say it’s Chun-Li.”</p>
