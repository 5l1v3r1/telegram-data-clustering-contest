      <h1>OK seriously, how smart is this $10 LED flashlight that’s always fully charged when you need it?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:05:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>Honestly, I feel like such a fool for not realizing that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Handheld-Rechargeable-Flashlight-Power-Failure/dp/B07PHQF4HY?tag=b0c55-20">ENERGIZER Compact Rechargeable Emergency LED Flashlight</a> was a thing that exists. If you already knew about it, then you obviously already have one and you may carry on. After all, who on Earth would find this awesome invention and then not get one!? What’s so great about this model, you ask? It has a built-in retractable plug so you can plug it directly into a power outlet and leave it there so it’s fully charged whenever you need it. Genius! You need it, and it’s on sale right now for less than $10 so you’re crazy if you pass it up.</p>
