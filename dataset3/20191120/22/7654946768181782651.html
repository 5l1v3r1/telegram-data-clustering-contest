      <p>The FDA on Wednesday announced disheartening news for snackers nationwide — the recall of certain boxes of Nabisco’s popular cheddar Cheese Nips.</p>
      <p>The manufacturer of the snacks, Mondelēz Global, reported the voluntary recall to the agency last Friday, revealing that a “limited quantity” of their 11-ounce Cheese Nips boxes may contain plastic inside them, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/mondelez-global-llc-conducts-voluntary-recall-limited-quantity-cheese-nips-11-oz-box-product-us-due">according to the recall notice</a>.</p>
      <p>Mondelēz Global said that if present, the yellow pieces would be from a dough scraper that’s used in their production process.</p>
      <p>The company first became aware of the issue when they spotted the plastic pieces on manufacturing equipment.</p>
      <p>To date, no injuries or illnesses were reported to the Mondelez Global stemming from the recalled product.</p>
      <p>“Consumers who have this product should not eat it,” the FDA warned in their recall notice,”and should discard any product they may have.”</p>
