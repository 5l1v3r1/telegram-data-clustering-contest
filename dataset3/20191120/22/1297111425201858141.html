      <p>Get ready for endless soup, salad and breadsticks, Regina.</p>
      <p>The city’s first Olive Garden, located on Gordon Road in the Grasslands Shopping Centre near Harbour Landing, opens at 11 a.m. Monday.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon is also getting a location of the Italian restaurant chain, which is yet to open. Each location is expected to create “about 150 jobs.”</p>
      <p>The location in Saskatoon is expected to open at Preston Crossing.</p>
      <p>Business experts in Saskatoon said the restaurant will be a welcome addition.</p>
      <p>“It’s very important that we have both sides of that coin, that equation, in terms of local, organic businesses that are grown right here in Saskatoon, as well as chain versions of business that come into Saskatoon,” said Darla Lindbjerg, CEO of the Greater Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>With Saskatoon the youngest, fastest growing metropolitan area in Canada, restaurant chains like Olive Garden and other businesses “are taking notice and seeing the potential here in Saskatoon,” she said.</p>
      <p>Terri Klyne, director of property management with Harvard Property Management Inc. in Saskatchewan — which operates the Preston Crossing open-air retail space — said the company is excited to have Olive Garden come into the mix.</p>
      <p>“Olive Garden is a household name in many other provinces and we are definitely excited to have them come to site,” Klyne said. “We expect that it will open to great fanfare.”</p>
