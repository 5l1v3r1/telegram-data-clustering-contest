      <h1>DP World Tour Championship: Take a shot on these golfers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:01:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author">Wes Reynolds, VSiN</a></address>
      <p>The European Tour’s Race to Dubai concludes this week with the season finale, the DP World Tour Championship.</p>
      <p>Bernd Wiesberger would need to finish near the bottom of the 50-player field to not claim the tour title. If that occurs, he could be caught by Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Shane Lowry or Matthew Fitzpatrick, depending on how they place. Tourney favorite Rory McIlroy (4/1) can’t capture the overall title.</p>
      <h3>The plays</h3>
      <p><b>Patrick Reed (18/1):</b> Has three appearances here in Dubai and after two top 10s, he finished as the runner-up here last year. He also may come in with some confidence after being selected as a captain’s pick by Tiger Woods for the Presidents Cup.</p>
      <p><b>Paul Casey (28/1):</b> Hasn’t played this event in five years but is an excellent golfer in the desert with two wins in Abu Dhabi and one win in Bahrain. Casey is also an Arizona resident who practices in desert conditions frequently.</p>
      <p><b>Lee Westwood (50/1):</b> Won the inaugural event here back in 2009. Westwood comes in with two top-10 finishes (10th in Turkey and sixth in Sun City) and is playing his best golf of the year.</p>
      <p><b>Tom Lewis (66/1):</b> Won the Korn Ferry Tour Championship to secure his PGA Tour card. Lewis finished seventh last year in his course debut and has two good desert finishes to start the year with a ninth in Abu Dhabi and a third in Saudi Arabia.</p>
