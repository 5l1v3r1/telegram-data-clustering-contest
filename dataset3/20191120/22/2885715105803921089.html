      <h2>International Film Festival of India gives a prominent place to mainstream films. That may not be its mandate</h2>

      <p>The International Film Festival of India (IFFI) self-professedly aims to “provide a common platform to project the excellence of the art of film-making”. In its 50th edition, now playing in Goa, it may need to renew its commitment to its mandate. The imperatives of the mainstream market — stars, box office collections, or even being accessible to a broad audience — are not meant to animate the IFFI. But, as iconic film-maker Adoor Gopalakrishnan told this newspaper, the IFFI is increasingly distancing itself from its stated purpose.</p>
      <p>The Indian Panorama section at the IFFI, according to Gopalakrishnan, is important because “it showcases the best of our production every year”. This year, 12 of the 26 films being showcased are commercial, mainstream works. Critics, producers and even the discerning audience at a film festival expect more than merely fare that has been successful commercially. “Sadly, with our stupid effort to preen the producers of worthless films, we are providing them with equal status and esteem as the quality filmmakers,” says Gopalakrishnan.</p>
      <p>He flags an important issue. For festivals the aim is, it must be, the discovery of the new, even the discomfiting; where cinema is art, not just a business proposition. Conversation with the alternative space in Indian cinema has only enriched the mainstream. Excellence in the former is based primarily on artistic merit. By introducing films that are judged by a different yardstick, the IFFI would be placating the audience rather than challenging it.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, when the festival removed films from the FTII seemingly due to protests by students against the appointment of Gajendra Chauhan as the film school’s director, it has lost some of its credibility. It can ill-afford to let the temptations of commerce and glamour erode its image further.</p>
