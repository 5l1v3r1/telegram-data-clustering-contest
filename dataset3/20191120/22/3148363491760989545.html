      <h1>Watch Live: Sixth Public Democrat Impeachment Inquiry Hearing</h1>

      <p>The House Intelligence Committee hearing, chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), was set to begin at 2:30 p.m. Eastern but was delayed three hours after the testimony of Ambassador Gordon Sondland ran long. It is the sixth hearing overall in the impeachment inquiry, and the fourth this week, as Democrats on the committee attempt to wrap up the public hearing portion of their inquiry by Thanksgiving recess.</p>
