      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/vodafone-group-plc">Vodafone</a> is set to refund nearly 73,000 customers a total of nearly €417,000.</p>
      <p>The cash return comes after ComReg decided the telecoms company had not complied sufficiently with customer information requirements.</p>
      <p>Vodafone is lawfully required to provide users with a ‘durable medium’ contract setting out the various terms.</p>
      <p>But following a probe, the communications regulator found Vodafone failed to comply with these conditions between September 2016 and March 2018.</p>
      <p>The company was adjudged to have not implemented the operator’s “Extra” Pay As You Go mobile phone offers for customers.</p>
      <p>Punters who topped up their accounts by the monthly tariff price of €20 or €30 did not know it would result in their accounts being reset, meaning they would lose their allowances.</p>
      <p>Vodafone has now committed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refunding 72,774 customers that may, in the past, not have intended to reset their offer when they topped up. The total amount to be refunded is €416,971.79.</li>
        <li>Advising customers in their contract at the point of sale that their offer will reset if the customer tops up by the amount of the offer.</li>
        <li>Amending the SMS sent to customers that top up by the amount of their offer to clearly inform the customer that their offer has been reset.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Read the full judgment below.</p>
