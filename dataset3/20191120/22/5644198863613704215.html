      <p>Small car platforms developed by France's Peugeot should be favored if plans to merge PSA and FiatChrysler go ahead, PSA executive Gaetano Thorel told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>MILAN: Small car platforms developed by France's Peugeot should be favored if plans to merge PSA and FiatChrysler go ahead, PSA executive Gaetano Thorel told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Managers on both sides are finalizing discussions to try and create the world's fourth-largest carmaker, a move that will result in choices being made about which technologies to adopt in the merged entity.</p>

      <p>“On smaller segments PSA has the platforms which allowed the group to make the highest margins in Europe among all the automakers, so I find it reasonable that these platforms might be used in the future on some FCA models too," Thorel said.</p>
      <p>"On the other hand FCA has got RAM and Jeep, and I find it reasonable that the new group might use those platforms in that segment,” Thorel, who is PSA's managing director for Italy, said.</p>
      <p>European labor unions have called on PSA and Fiat Chrysler to avoid job cuts and factory closures as the two major carmakers prepare to complete a US$50 billion deal to create the world's fourth-largest carmaker.</p>
