      <p>Police found pills and marijuana at the Virginia home of Washington Redskins safety Montae Nicholson during a police search that took place following the apparent overdose death of 21-year-old woman, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/pills-marijuana-foil-with-residue-found-in-home-of-redskin-montae-nicholson-after-womans-apparent-overdose-search-warrant-says/2019/11/19/acb2ee0a-0af2-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html">according to a search warrant seen by The Washington Post</a>.</p>
      <p>The Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office has been investigating Julia Crabbe’s death since Nicholson and another man, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2019/11/20/montae-nicholson-washington-redskins-marijuana-pills/4247075002/">identified by USA Today</a> as Kyle Askew-Collins, brought her to a Loudoun County emergency room in an unresponsive state on Thursday. She later died.</p>
      <p>Hospital staff said Crabbe “appeared to be deceased” when the men dropped her off, the search warrant said.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office has since said Crabbe showed signs of an overdose. A state medical examiner is waiting a toxicology test results that could help reveal her cause and manner of death. The test results could take months.</p>
      <p>Nicholson’s home in Ashburn, Virginia, was searched by police hours after the men dropped Crabbe off at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Police recovered pills, marijuana, a safe, black box, iPhone, coat, and notebook from the house, USA Today said.</p>
      <p>The warrant did not state who the drugs belonged to. Nicholson’s lawyer, Mark Dycio, told The Washington Post that his client didn’t know about the drugs.</p>
      <p>“Montae would have no knowledge of the drugs because they belonged to a guest,” Dycio said. “It’s a tragic story. It’s a tragedy that the news is focused on where she died instead of the drug epidemic ravaging the country.”</p>
      <p>No one has been charged in the death. Authorities are still investigating what happened.</p>
      <p>Redskins interim coach Bill Callahan previously offered condolences to Crabbe’s family, and said the death had no impact on the team’s decision to play Nicholson on Sunday.</p>
