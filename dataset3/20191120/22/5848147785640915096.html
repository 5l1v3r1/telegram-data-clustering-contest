      <h1>‘Perfect storm’: Extreme warnings for asthma sufferers as pollen bomb hits Melbourne</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:25:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/ckelly/" target="_blank">Cait Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Victorians will be exposed to a deadly pollen bomb that could put hundreds of lives at risk of the ‘thunderstorm asthma’ condition that caught the state by surprise and killed 10 people three years ago.</p>
      <p>A ‘perfect storm’ of asthma triggers is forecast on Thursday – and could continue throughout the bushfire season – as very high pollen, smoke haze and thunderstorms combine to increase breathing difficulties.</p>
      <p>Those who suffer from asthma should take extra care as the possible bushfires, dangerous heat and wind bring extreme pollen levels, the National Asthma Council Australia (NAC) has said.</p>
      <p>Smoke from bushfires posed a severe danger to sufferers, said NAC chief executive Siobhan Brophy.</p>
      <p>“People do not need to be in the immediate area of a fire to suffer from the effect of smoke on their lungs,” Ms Brophy said.</p>
      <p>“Wherever smoke haze is visible, it is a threat to those with asthma.”</p>
      <p>Ten people – aged 18 to 57 – died three years ago on November 21, 2016, after a freak thunderstorm asthma event hit Melbourne.</p>
      <p>The fatal thunderstorm put an unprecedented demand on the city’s ambulances and health professionals as about 14,000 people were taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>A combination of high pollen levels, strong winds, hot temperatures, air moisture and a cold front triggered severe asthma attacks.</p>
      <p>Law student Hope Marsh, 20, died in the arms of family after being struck down by the attack.</p>
      <p>She was at home when she started feeling wheezy and was taken outside to get some “fresh air” before she collapsed and died.</p>

      <p>The ambulance arrived more than 30 minutes after it was called.</p>
      <p>She was remembered as a “beautiful soul” by her family and friends.</p>
      <p>For many others, the attack also came on quickly.</p>
      <p>Professor Jo Douglass, from the Royal Melbourne Hospital, told an inquest into the deaths last year that for many it was less than 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>“The average time from complaint to respiratory arrest was very short,” she told the court.</p>
      <p>“Fifteen minutes does not really leave anyone time to do much.”</p>
      <p>Thursday’s tragic anniversary is a timely reminder for everyone, not just sufferers to be cautious, Ms Brophy said.</p>
      <p>“Thunderstorm asthma does not just occur in people with asthma, it affects those who have an allergic reaction to the grains in the air.</p>
      <p>“One in five Australians have hay fever and many do not know they could be at risk of having an asthma attack during a thunderstorm asthma event.”</p>
      <p>At-risk Victorians should avoid being outside during fires and storms, especially during windy weather, and should carry their asthma reliever with them at all times, she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s crucial to watch out for asthma attack signs, such as difficulty breathing or talking, a feeling of not being able to get enough air into your lungs, or constant coughing or wheezing.”</p>
      <p>Those with the condition should follow their asthma action plan and first-aid steps. If symptoms get worse, call an ambulance.</p>
      <p>The NAC is also warning those who have never experienced asthma to stay alert and to follow the first-aid steps for asthma if experiencing breathing difficulties.</p>
