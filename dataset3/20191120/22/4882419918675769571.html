      <p>The Royal Spanish Football Federation have announced that Luis Enrique will be presented on Wednesday, Nov. 27 (11.30h) after returning as Spain coach this week.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique was forced to step down due to personal reasons earlier this year, with his daughter seriously ill. She sadly passed away in the summer and, following a period of mourning, the former Barcelona coach has decided to return to the Spain post.</p>
      <p>Robert Moreno, Lucho's former No.2, had been promoted to head coach in the meantime, but he will now leave the national team's coaching staff completely after helping La Roja qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>RFEF chief Luis Rubiales confirmed the news in a press conference on Tuesday and Luis Enrique will have his second presentation on Nov. 27, three days before the draw for the Euro 2020 finals (Nov. 30 in Bucharest).</p>
