      <p>Newcastle's waterfront has taken on a more festive look after the city's council installed an 11-metre tall Christmas tree at Queens Wharf on the weekend.</p>
      <p>The tree is adorned by more than 4300 lights and 350 decorations and will be lit for the first time on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>"Novocastrians love getting into the Christmas spirit, which is why we see thousands of people flock to see Christmas lights and sing carols at events across the city and region," lord mayor Nuatali Nelmes said.</p>
      <p>"Novocastrians will appreciate the sight of the tree by the harbour, especially at night.</p>
      <p>"It's sure to become a major drawcard, bringing families into the city.</p>
