      <h1>Sondland: 'Every Meeting at the White House Has Conditions' | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Wednesday afternoon that “every meeting at the White House has conditions,” under questioning from Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) in the fifth public hearing in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:27:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:27</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak, Joel B. Pollak</a></address>
      <p>Swalwell suggested that the idea that the White House had insisted on certain conditions before it would meet with newly-elected Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky was somewhat suspicious:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Swalwell: </b>Would you agree that it is wrong for the President of the United States to ask the leader of a foreign government to investigate the President of the United States’s political opponent? <b>Sondland:</b> Yes.  <b>Swalwell:</b> Would you agree that, in addition to making that request for an investigation, leveraging a visit at the White House, that a foreign government leader desperately needs, is also wrong?  <b>Sondland:</b> Leveraging in what respect?  <b>Swalwell:</b> A meeting at the White House. If someone really needs a meeting at the White House to show their legitimacy to their people, that leveraging that meeting and asking for an investigation would be wrong.  <b>Sondland:</b> To be candid, Congressman, every meeting at the White House has conditions placed on it. I have never worked on a meeting at the White House that doesn’t have a host of conditions placed on it.  <b>Swalwell: </b>If one of those conditions is to investigate a political opponent, you would agree that would be wrong. <b>Sondland: </b>The political opponent, yes. but making announcements or investigations per se, no. </blockquote>
      <p>Sondland testified that a White House meeting was held out as a “quid pro quo” in exchange for Ukraine starting investigations, including into allegations of corruption by Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>However, he also testified that he never actually heard the president tell him about preconditions for a meeting.</p>
