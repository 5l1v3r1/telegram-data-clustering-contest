      <p>In today's game, it is hard to believe that Ben Simmons had more All-Star appearances than made 3-point field goals in his career but it was true until tonight. Simmons notched his first career triple from the corner as the 76ers faced off against the New York Knicks. </p>
      <p>Simmons has admitted that his shooting is subpar but it should be a welcomed sight that he is more willing to take those shots and evidently has the capability of making them as well. </p>
