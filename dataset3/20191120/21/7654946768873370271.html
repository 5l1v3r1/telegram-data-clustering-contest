      <h1>Man dies after falling in the street near Times Square</h1>

      <p>A 61-year-old man died 10 days after falling in the street near Times Square and getting run over by a clueless driver, cops said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The man, whose name was not released pending notification of family, fell while crossing 8th Avenue at W. 40th Street just after 11:15 p.m. on Nov. 7, according to police.</p>
      <p>At the same time, a Honda Accord stopped at the traffic signal, got a green light and drove through the intersection — unknowingly running over the man, cops said.</p>
      <p>The Honda’s 24-year-old driver had stopped just after the light to check if he’d hit anything or for any damage but didn’t notice any — or the man lying critically injuring in the road due to traffic and drove off, cops said.</p>
      <p>EMS rushed the 61-year-old to NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue, where he died last Sunday, according to police.</p>
      <p>No one has been charged in the accident, cops said.</p>
