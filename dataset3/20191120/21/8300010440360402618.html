      <p>MEXICO -- A 5.4 magnitude earthquake rattled the southern Pacific coast of Mexico before dawn just hours after a 6.3 quake.<br/><br/>The U.S. Geological Survey said the two quakes occurred at almost the same spot, just offshore from the Mexico-Guatemala border.<br/><br/>It was unclear if the 5.4 quake at 11:30 a.m. UTC on Wednesday was an aftershock of the 6.3 temblor at 4:27 a.m. UTC.<br/><br/>The civil defense office of the southern state of Chiapas said no damage was immediately reported.</p>
