      <p>A mother was confessed to suffocating her three young sons to death because she was jealous of the attention their father gave them, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Brittany Pilkington, 27, was convicted on Tuesday of smothering her sons in three separate incidents over a 13-month period in Bellefontaine, Ohio.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said she killed her 3-month-old son Niall in July 2014, her four-year-old son Gavin in April 2015 and her 3-month-old son Noah in August 2015.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and murder in exchange for being spared the death penalty, <a href="https://www.whio.com/news/crime--law/bellefontaine-woman-accused-killing-sons-appear-court-today/AE7siYntee5hknUyoDtsxN/">WHIO reported.</a></p>
      <p>After Noah was found dead, Pilkington admitted to killing her children because of the attention they received from their father, who was Pilkington’s ex-boyfriend.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors said she felt her ex-boyfriend did not give her or her daughter the same attention, <a href="https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/brittany-pilkington-gets-37-years-in-prison-for-killing-her-three-sons">according to Oxygen</a>.</p>

      <p>In August 2015, emergency responders were called to Pilkington’s home after her son Noah reportedly stopped breathing, but they were unable to resuscitate the boy. The incident occurred less than a week after a court returned Noah to his mother.</p>
      <p>Pilkington’s four-year-old son Gavin died of similar circumstances in April 2015, and when her infant son Niall died in July 2014.</p>
      <p>After Noah died, Pilkington reportedly confessed to killing her sons after initially claiming genetics played a role in their deaths.</p>
      <p>Police never charged in her first two sons’ deaths because of lack of evidence, authorities said.</p>

      <p>Kort Gatterdam, Pilkington’s lawyer, said her client suffered brain damage from lead poisoning she got as a child. Gatterdam also said Pilkington suffered trauma from years of abuse, with some of the abuse coming from Joe Pilkington, the children’s father.</p>
      <p>Joe Pilkington pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sexual imposition after if was discovered that he had sex with Pilkington when she was a minor.</p>
      <p>Britanny was sentenced two consecutive jail terms of 15 years to life and seven years for manslaughter.</p>
