      <p>Despite the holiday, Christmas is one of the most popular times to head out to the movies.</p>
      <p>This year, there are four films opening on Christmas Day and a handful of other potential blockbusters opening the weekend before.</p>
      <p>Not sure what to see? Insider rounded up the wider releases that will be out around the holidays. It’s a lot more than just “Star Wars.”</p>

      <h3>1. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker”</h3>

        <figcaption>“Star Wars” is the big holiday film of the year.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Release date:</b> December 20, 2019</p>
      <p><b>What it’s about:</b> The big holiday event of the year is Disney and Lucasfilm’s “Star Wars” sequel. It’s the culmination of nine movies, wrapping up the Skywalker Saga, which started in 1977’s “A New Hope.”</p>
      <p><b>Why you should see it: </b>The “Star Wars” universe has left a lot of questions unanswered while teasing many more. Will we finally learn the truth about Rey’s parentage and what’s up with her new lightsaber? How will Princess Leia’s story wrap up? Is Emperor Palpatine back from the dead?</p>
      <p>Director J.J. Abrams has a massive task ahead of him. After delivering a nostalgic return to a galaxy far, far away in “The Force Awakens,” Abrams is tasked with closing out the franchise after a divisive eighth entry into the franchise. Hopefully, he wraps up everything neatly in “Episode IX” to bring the saga to a satisfying close.</p>

      <h3>2. “Cats”</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Release date:</b> December 20, 2019</p>
      <p><b>What it’s about:</b> Based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber play, a group of cats, the Jellicles, decide to send one cat to “the Heaviside Layer” (aka heaven) to be reborn.</p>
      <p><b>Why we’re interested one way or another:</b> As bizarre as the trailers may be, the film has too many big stars to ignore it. Taylor Swift, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, and more are in the cast.</p>
      <p>You can see the <a href="https://www.insider.com/cats-movie-actors-in-real-life-2019-7">full cast of “Cats” and who they’re playing here</a>.</p>

      <h3>3. “Bombshell”</h3>

        <figcaption>Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman are aiming for their shot at Oscar season.<cite>BRON Studios/GEM Entertainment</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Release date:</b> December 20, 2019</p>
      <p><b>What it’s about:</b> “Bombshell” follows the real-life events surrounding the resignation of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. He stepped down after Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), and other women accused him of sexual harassment.</p>
      <p><b>Why to see it</b>: The Ailes scandal was one of the first instances of women speaking out against powerful sexual harassers, since it happened about a year before the Me Too movement really took off. It’ll be interesting to see how the filmmakers approach the subject matter in retrospect, given our attitudes towards toxic masculinity and abuses of power now.</p>

      <h3>4. “Ip Man 4: The Finale”</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Release date:</b> December 20, 2019</p>
      <p><b>What it’s about:</b> The fourth film <a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/martial-arts/article/3030022/fans-saddened-donnie-yen-confirms-ip-man-4-will-be-last">closes out the popular martial arts franchise</a> that’s based on the life of Wing Chun grandmaster Ip Man. In the final film, his student, Buce Lee, opens a school based on the Chinese Kung fu style in San Francisco, upsetting some of the locals.</p>
      <p><b>Why we’re interested: </b>If you only know actor Donnie Yen from “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” you owe it to yourself to catch up with this franchise for the fight choreography alone. Yen plays a modest, well-respected Wing Chu master who stood up for justice in the face of adversity.</p>

      <p><b>Release date: </b>December 25, 2019</p>
      <p><b>What it’s about:</b> Lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) and local advocate Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) fight to prove the innocence of a man (Jamie Foxx) sentenced to die for the murder of an 18-year-old.</p>
      <p><b>Why we’re interested:</b> The film is based on Stevenson who helped defend those who were wrongly convicted and put on death row and his 2014 book “Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption.” After “Fruitvale Station,” it’s about time Jordan gets an Oscar nod. This may be the film to give him one.</p>

      <p><b>Why we’re interested:</b> The film is based on a story told to director Sam Mendes by his grandfather. What really makes the movie stand out is the way it was shot. The movie is supposed to look like it was <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/new-1917-video-shows-how-movie-appears-as-one-continuous-take-1244229">shot in one continuous take</a>. Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, and Andrew Scott star.</p>

      <p><b>What it’s about:</b> Will Smith stars as secret agent Lance Sterling, who accidentally gets turned into a pigeon by a young scientist (Tom Holland).</p>
