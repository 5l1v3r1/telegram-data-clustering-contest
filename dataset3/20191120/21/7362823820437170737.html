      <p>The health agency said it’s not likely that the item, which was part of Lot #255406963, and marked with UPC  0 77745 27249 8 and was sold in Sam’s Club stores in Maryland, is still available. It was packaged with a “Best By” date of Oct. 31.</p>
      <p>The agency also said that though the patients in Maryland had reported eating the product, the cases confirmed in other states did not involve this particular salad.</p>

      <p>E. coli symptoms may vary from person to person, with some experiencing severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting while others develop a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days, but other cases can be severe or even life-threatening, according to the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2019/o157h7-11-19/index.html"> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</a></p>
