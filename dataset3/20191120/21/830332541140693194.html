      <h1>2 more officials to testify Wednesday evening in impeachment hearing</h1>
      <h2>Laura Cooper, David Hale coming up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:21:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Liptak, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - After <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/public-impeachment-hearing-day-4/index.html">explosive morning testimony</a> directly linking President Donald Trump to an alleged "quid pro quo" in Ukraine, two government officials will tell lawmakers what they knew about the "quo" -- <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/dod-ig-investigation-ukraine-aid-delay/index.html">US security assistance</a> -- as well as the circumstances surrounding its holdup.</p>
      <p>Wednesday's second public hearing will pair longtime Pentagon official <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/who-is-laura-cooper/index.html">Laura Cooper</a> with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/politics/who-is-david-hale/index.html">David Hale</a>, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, for what's expected to be a technical exploration of how the aid was held up and how US policy in Ukraine was hijacked by the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>In her closed deposition last month -- which was delayed for several hours as some House Republicans <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/republicans-storm-impeachment-inquiry-deposition-laura-cooper/index.html">attempted to storm the secure hearing room</a> -- Cooper told the impeachment committees she came to had learned over the summer that US assistance to Ukraine was being held up for reasons that weren't entirely clear.</p>
      <p>In her role as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, Cooper helped orchestrate US strategy for bolstering Ukraine's military, a bulwark against Russia. She played a coordinating role in managing the financial and military assistance Congress approved -- and participated in meetings when the aid was held.</p>
      <p>She testified that some fellow officials had raised questions about whether the hold was legal.</p>
      <p>A detail she revealed in her private interview undercut a key argument from the White House: that there could be no "quid pro quo" if the Ukrainians didn't know the aid was frozen. She says she had a "very strong inference" they did know.</p>
      <p>Hale, her partner in Wednesday's hearing, will offer more details about the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, the onetime US ambassador to Ukraine. The number-three official at the State Department, he testified privately earlier this month that he had advocated for Yovanovitch as Giuliani was orchestrating a smear campaign against her. But ultimately he did not push for a public statement of support.</p>
      <p>A number of State Department officials have testified so far in the public hearings, but Hale is the most senior. A career foreign service officer, he told lawmakers during his earlier deposition that the judgment from senior State Department officials was that a statement supporting Yovanovitch would only worsen the situation.</p>
      <p>"It would be better for everyone, including the ambassador, to try to just move past this," he said.</p>
