      <p>Mr. Wilson Erinayo Oryema was the first Ugandan Inspector General of Police following Uganda’s independence in 1962.</p>
      <p>When self-government was proclaimed in March 1962, the title of Commissioner of Police was abolished and replaced by Inspector General of Police. On April 17, 1964, Oryema was sworn in by the then Prime Minister, Dr. Apollo Milton Obote.</p>

      <p>Oryema played the role of expanding the police and recruiting highly educated cadet officers into the force.</p>
      <p>He performed it well until the military coup of 1971 when President Idi Amin removed him and made him a minister, and later killed him in 1977. He succeeded the last British Commissioner of Police, Michael Macoun, who became advisor to the Ugandan government before leaving the country in September 1964.</p>
