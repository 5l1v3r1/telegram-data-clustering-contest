      <h1>Level Lock brings HomeKit to your existing deadbolt with invisible design</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:23:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>A new smart lock with a unique approach has been announced today called <a href="https://level.co/products/level-lock">Level Lock</a>. The clever invisible design means it works with your existing (traditional) deadbolt and keys to bring <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/homekit/">Apple HomeKit</a> functionality to any door without changing the look of your existing hardware. Beyond Siri and the HomeKit integration, there are handy features like auto-unlock via proximity with your iOS device (in addition to Bluetooth), a “Party Pass” feature to give multiple friends or family access, and more.</p>
      <p><a href="https://level.co/products/level-lock">Level Lock</a> has launched with preorders open for early customers with the new HomeKit lock slated to ship in January 2020.</p>
      <p>While there have been <a href="https://amzn.to/2OuSyft">some HomeKit lock products in the past</a> to attach to the back of your deadbolt to offer the ability to keep your existing lock and key, Level Lock takes that idea to a whole new… threshold.</p>
      <p>This smart lock just replaces the interior fitting of your deadbolt giving it the HomeKit smarts and leaving your existing deadbolt intact.</p>
