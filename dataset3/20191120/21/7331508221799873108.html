      <p>The one-game suspension for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050122/larry-ogunjobi">Larry Ogunjobi</a> was upheld by appeals officer James Thrash on Wednesday, the NFL announced.</p>
      <p>Thrash, however, rescinded Ogunjobi's fine of $10,527.</p>
      <p>Ogunjobi had been disciplined for shoving <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> from behind during last Thursday night's game after Browns teammate <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122132/myles-garrett">Myles Garrett</a> had hit the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> quarterback on top of his head with Rudolph's own helmet.</p>
      <p>The NFL said rulings on the appeals by Garrett and the Steelers' <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13250/maurkice-pouncey">Maurkice Pouncey</a> will be issued later in the week.</p>
      <p>Garrett was given an indefinite suspension of at least six games for striking Rudolph, while Pouncey received a three-game ban for kicking and punching Garrett.</p>
      <p>Rudolph called Garrett's actions "bush league" and "cowardly" during his news conference following Pittsburgh's 21-7 loss to Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Appeals officers are jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFLPA. Thrash also conducted the hearing for Garrett on Wednesday, and Derrick Brooks heard the Pouncey appeal Tuesday.</p>
