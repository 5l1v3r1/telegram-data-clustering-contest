      <h1>Damon Dash Surrenders To Cops Over Child Support Warrants</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:59:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:59</time> by <a rel="author">AllHipHop Staff</a></address>
      <p>The legendary rap mogul was nabbed in New York today and taken into custody over two felony warrants for a big child support bill.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Former Roc-A-Fella Records boss Damon Dash was briefly locked up after police finally arrested him over a massive back child support bill.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the 49-year-old turned himself in today (November 20th) after he was accused of "fleeing" the state of New York over arrest warrants for owing over $400,000 in unpaid support.</p>
      <p>Damon is accused of owing the small fortune to the mothers of his children, Cindy Morales and Rachel Roy.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/dame-dash-reportedly-argues-his-56-000-income-is-too-low-to-cover-child-support-1pG3ZewrVE6aVTRN7L3BlQ/">Over the past few weeks, Damon has been fighting to modify his child support obligations with Roy, claiming he made a paltry $56,000, compared to Roy's $500,000 in earnings for the same period.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Right now, Dame is required to pay $6,000 a month in child support for 19-year-old Ava and 11-year-old Tallulah.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/damon-dash-plans-to-turn-himself-in-for-child-support-warrants-in-new-york--cX3CkXuNU2Z_gvW1jZQZg/">In March, Damon declared himself innocent and he vowed going to jail would be no issue for him.</a>
      </p>
      <p>"I'll sit in jail for three or four days or whatever they want to accuse me of doing. I'm an innocent man, so there's no reason for me not to go turn myself in," Damon Dash snapped although he remained on the lam. "I'm sick of my name being compromised and I want my company back."</p>
      <p>Just last week, Damon blasted reports he was growing broke after it was revealed he was struggling to pay back a $2,400 debt in a separate legal battle.</p>
      <p>Damon isn't broke, because director Lee Daniels is paying him over $1.7 million to squash a dispute related to a Richard Pryor biopic.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/damon-dash-seeking-to-prevent-lee-daniels-from-paying-off-his-child-support-bill-CnciDq0A3UO7eF5B3djTYg/">Lee Daniels claimed both women were trying to get their cuts first, but Damon told a judge not to give them a penny until he squares away his disputes with Cindy Morales and Rachel Roy.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Dame is already out of jail and he says he is "warrant" free after paying off both bills. </p>
