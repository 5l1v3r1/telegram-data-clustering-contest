      <h1>How Investors Have Reacted to the Business Roundtable Statement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:22:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:22</time> by <a rel="author">Karen Firestone</a></address>
      <p>When the U.S. Business Roundtable <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">announced</a> that it was redefining the purpose of a corporation to accommodate a broader group of stakeholders – extending beyond shareholders to include employees, customers, suppliers and communities – the stock market didn’t seem to react. I saw no thick reports from market strategists detailing how these new principles would affect company earnings or stock prices, whereas reports on trade, interest rates, and consumer spending continuously streamed across my screen.</p>
      <p>It made me wonder: What are shareholders thinking about this new direction? What about the professional investors who manage their assets?</p>
      <p>On the shareholder side, the direction the Roundtable is taking appears to reflect a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/#4c1908611695">strong move</a> toward environmental, social and governance principles, commonly referred to as ESG. The concept arose in 2004 when U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the world’s leading financial institutions <a href="https://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/events/2004/stocks/who_cares_wins_global_compact_2004.pdf">to consider ESG factors</a> in their allocation of capital, which he believed would ultimately benefit not just society and the environment, but also businesses. The Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) estimates that investors have since <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/global-sustainable-investing-assets-surged-30-trillion-2018">placed more than $30 trillion</a> under this mantle, meaning they have purchased shares of funds or stocks that carry an ESG or SRI (Socially Responsible Investing) designation, granted by an internal or external ratings system.</p>
      <p>Calpers, the California state retirement pension authority, which is one of the largest U.S. shareholders, has begun mounting activist campaigns in recent years to change public company policies, for example <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/calpersdiversity-push-blends-social-investing-camps/2019/06/18/d00f2496-91c5-11e9-956a-88c291ab5c38">pushing</a> Red Rock Resorts last year to amend their governance practices or risk losing their vote in proxies.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, with over $1 trillion, and the owner of 1.4% of all global equities, has <a href="https://www.gfmag.com/magazine/may-2017/norways-giant-fund-stamps-big-activist-feet">pushed</a> for goals such as the separation of CEO and chairman roles, more board diversity, and gender pay equality. And the U.K. government last month implemented rules that require pension plans to <a href="https://www.globalelr.com/2019/08/esg-factors-spur-changes-in-uk-pension-scheme-disclosure-requirements/">regularly consider ESG</a> investing in their allocation process.</p>
      <p>What about the professional investors who manage these clients’ assets? Several of the leading firms, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Capital Group, have begun to offer products that allow shareholders to invest exclusively in companies that are certified as following socially responsible guidelines. But smaller competitors don’t have the advantage of scale or a business model built to continuously launch new products.</p>
      <p>After the Roundtable proclamation, I wanted to learn more about whether my colleagues — those who actively manage portfolios and hedge funds — felt this new stakeholder model might affect their own investing practices.  I surveyed 20 institutional investors located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, representing close to $35 billion of assets under management.</p>
      <p>Nearly all the European managers whom I surveyed said their clients have asked about their efforts in the ESG sphere. That may be why the data shows managers are responding. According to the <a href="http://www.gsi-alliance.org/">Global Sustainable Investment Alliance</a>, 49% of professionally managed assets in Europe adhere to some sustainable guidelines, compared to 26% for the U.S. and 18% for Japan. The majority of the European investment managers I surveyed reported having taken some action such as disclosing ESG portfolio scores in quarterly reports, hiring an ESG consultant, and using an ESG stock screening program. One large European manager explained that “ESG policies have become absolutely central to nearly every European company.”</p>
      <p>Contrast that to what I heard from the U.S and Asian managers: not one acknowledged formal adoption of ESG-stock screening. While my small sample of managers may be atypical of whole countries, a recent study revealed that less than 30% of all U.S.-managed assets are considered ESG compliant — far below that in Europe. (Other than Japan, where 20% of assets have an ESG tilt, most Asian corporations are far behind other geographies in terms of <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2115233/why-asia-lukewarm-sustainable-investing">reporting their ESG practices</a>.) One manager from the U.S. told me, “until the formulas for CEO compensation in the U.S. changes to reward them for more than earnings per share and stock price appreciation, we are unlikely to take the Business Roundtable statement seriously.”</p>
      <p>But some firms, including my own, have designed their own ESG screens or manage a version of their core portfolio that focuses on socially responsible investing, usually eliminating fossil fuel, tobacco, and firearms equities. While this is a step in the right direction, smaller fund managers will need to do more, especially if more major shareholders demand we invest in companies whose business style reflects the Business Roundtable commitments to employees, the environment, and their broader community. We can start by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deciding which aspects of ESG we value most, screening for them, and highlighting those to their clients. If, for example, you are interested in transparency and diversity on corporate boards, you should formalize and showcase this intent.</li>
        <li>Learning how important SRI is to current and potential clients. This means polling clients to assess their interest and explaining where your focus may overlap. For example, we describe to prospects our fossil fuel-free portfolio with its five-year track record.</li>
        <li>Investing in screening tools to discover how our portfolio fares on U.N. or GSIA standards. From there, you can market a strong score or potentially change some positioning.</li>
        <li>Applying pressure on companies whose shares we own to improve their ESG practices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The investment community needs to keep pace with the new vision of the Business Roundtable to serve a broader set of stakeholders. While this will take time and require work, professional investors can turn to colleagues in Europe as a model for how efforts can be successful.</p>
