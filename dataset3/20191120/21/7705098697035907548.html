      <h1>The Witcher’s Official Poster Gears Up For Battle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:39:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:39</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Netflix’s series adaptation of <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-witcher"><b>The Witcher</b></a> is just a few weeks away. To prepare for its arrival, Netflix has revealed a new poster, with <b>The Witcher</b>‘s leading heroes together and ready for action. The poster went up on the <a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1197205523587878923">official <b>Witcher</b> Twitter account</a>, along with the following poem:</p>
      <p>“Try as they might to stray from the course,</p>
      <p>they can’t escape destiny; it’s such a great force.</p>
      <p>That’s not a spoiler, it’s straight from the source!</p>
      <p>Also not pictured, the bard and a horse.”</p>
      <p>The full poster is below, featuring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia. To his left is Anya Chalotra as Yennefer of Vengerberg, with Freya Allan as Princess Ciri on the right.</p>

      <p>Last week, it confirmed that a second season of <b>The Witcher</b> <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/471626-the-witcher-season-2-has-already-been-ordered-by-netflix">is already on the way</a>, with Cavill, Chalotra and Allan all set to return.</p>

      <p>Following that announcement, showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich <a href="https://twitter.com/LHissrich/status/1194662006734897159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194662006734897159&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superherohype.com%2Ftv%2F471626-the-witcher-season-2-has-already-been-ordered-by-netflix">expressed her gratitude</a>.</p>
      <p>“I could not be more proud of what the amazing cast and crew of <b>The Witcher</b> have accomplished, and can’t wait for the world to dig in and enjoy these stories with us.”</p>
      <p>Instead of focusing on the same lore as CD Projekt Red’s popular video games, Netflix’s take on <b>The Witcher</b> will be closer to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witcher-Boxed-Set-Contempt-Baptism/dp/0316438979/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=the+witcher+books&amp;qid=1574276359&amp;sr=8-2">Andrzej Sapkowski’s books</a>. It will still follow Cavill’s Geralt character as he uses his powers to hunt down monsters. However, they’ll also make him stand out from other humans. Over the course of the series, fans will see what his adventures hold — and what dangers lie ahead.</p>
      <p>Netflix will drop the first season of <b>The Witcher</b> on December 20.</p>
