      <p>The new series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here is only a few days old but there is already news of two late arrivals.</p>
      <p>Ant &amp; Dec returned to ITV on Sunday night for the 19th series of the hit TV show with an eclectic lineup that includes Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright and Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>There was an immediate divide in the jungle when <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-power-pairs-17272145">the celebs were split into two camps,</a> with the 'power pairs' enjoying luxury in the main camp, while the rest were forced to slum it and even sleep on the floor in the 'rough camp'.</p>
      <p>And before the first week of this year's series is through, the campmates will be joined by two new arrivals, who have one major thing in common - they are both soap legends!</p>
      <p>One of them - Andrew Whyment - shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, it was more of a shock that the Coronation Street star isn't already in the jungle, having had his name strongly linked with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> for weeks now.</p>

      <p>And the man better known as Kirk Sutherland isn't the only soap star set to soon be bedding down in the jungle. The second late arrival will21 former Eastenders actor Cliff Parisi - better known as ex Albert Square regular Minty.</p>
      <p>Cliff went on to appear in BBC drama Call The Midwife and show bosses think the 59-year-old and Andy will be just the tonic for this year's series.</p>
      <p>A show source said "An ITV source said: “With Cliff and Andy we have got too big soap names joining the jungle and they'll be a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>“Cliff is the final piece in the puzzle and comes from two massive BBC shows. It will be interesting to see if he sees the funny side of things when he has been in there a while and the hunger and tiredness kicks in.”</p>
