      <p>Huawei Smart Screen Gets WiFi Alliance Certification, Launch Imminent<br/>5 (100%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>At IFA 2019, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/huawei">Huawei</a> showcased its first-ever smart television dubbed simply <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/16/huawei-smart-screen-poster-shows-some-interesting-features/">Huawei Smart Screen</a>. Since then, television has already made its way to the Chinese market. It seems like the company is now gearing up for the global launch. After bagging the Bluetooth certification, the smart screen has now appeared on the WiFi Alliance listing. The listing, as expected, has revealed few details of the upcoming product.</p>
      <h3>Huawei Smart Screen Surfaced Once Again, WiFi Alliance Certification</h3>
      <p>The Smart Screen surfaced on the WiFi Alliance listing with the model number OSCA-550Y on November 19. The 550 in the model number suggests that the television will indeed arrive in a 55-inch model. Huawei Smart Screen also comes in two other size variants namely 65-inch and 75-inch. Furthermore, the listing also talks about the software the device will be rocking on. The upcoming television will run on the HarmonyOS just like the Chinese variants. Sadly, the listing does not reveal anything else about the product. In fact, if the device managed to hit the EU market, then it will be the first product to feature the company’s own software. Just like the Chinese variants, we’re expecting the television to come with negligible bezels delivering an immersive all-screen experience.</p>
      <h3>Price, Availability</h3>
      <p>Since the television has now made its way to the WiFi Alliance, we’re expecting the Smart Screen to see its official unveiling anytime soon. Above all, this might be the global launch that the fans have been desperately waiting for, for a long time. We’re expecting the product to first hit Europe and then to all the other major global markets. The television should come to the Indian market considering the fact that Honor India already has two smart televisions in its portfolio. Since the launch should be nearing, we can expect more leaks and rumors to come towards us soon.</p>
