        <b>With the international break over, Leeds United’s players will be switching their attention back to the coming months at Elland Road. Marcelo Bielsa’s side are third in the Championship and they are unbeaten in their last five.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is a cliche to suggest that there are no easy games in the Championship. But Leeds fans would be forgiven for feeling extremely optimistic about their upcoming run.</p>

      <p>The Whites do not face a side higher than 12th in any of their next six games. And they will be hoping to set themselves up for a crucial run of games around Christmas which includes clashes with Fulham, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>So just to whet the appetite for the resumption of the domestic season, here are TBR’s predictions for Leeds’s next six results, starting with their fixture with Luton Town this weekend…</p>
      <h3>Luton 1-2 Leeds</h3>
      <p>Luton have not been involved in a game that has had fewer than two goals since August. Leeds fans meanwhile, are yet to see the floodgates really open at any stage this term. The Whites have the quality to win what could be a tricky game. But Bielsa may be wary of a certain Izzy Brown.</p>
      <h3>Reading 0-2 Leeds</h3>
      <p>Reading have been on a fantastic run lately. They have won three of their last four games. But Leeds may be the team to burst their bubble. Bielsa’s men won comfortably at the Madejski last season, and should be able to do it again this term.</p>

      <h3>Leeds 1-0 Middlesbrough</h3>
      <p>Leeds may add to the pressure on Jonathan Woodgate. But it would be no surprise if the game looks extremely familiar to Whites fans. Boro do not score many, and do not concede many considering they are second-bottom. It may not be easy, but Leeds should get another three points.</p>
      <h3>Huddersfield 1-1 Leeds</h3>
      <p>Huddersfield have been much better since Danny Cowley’s arrival. And Leeds have lost their last three games against the Terriers. It is the kind of game that could see the home side produce a crowd-pleasing performance. And Leeds may not be too disappointed with a draw.</p>
      <h3>Leeds 2-1 Hull</h3>
      <p>One of Leeds’s more memorable defeats last season came when Hull came to Elland Road. The Tigers have been a real mixed bag this term, winning six and losing six. They have quality going forward, but that may help Leeds unlock Grant McCann’s side.</p>
      <h3>Leeds 1-1 Cardiff</h3>
      <p>It remains to be seen how Cardiff get on under Neil Harris. Millwall had a good record against Leeds under his leadership, and Cardiff have a good squad. Leeds clearly have the potential to secure the win. But the Bluebirds may be very happy with frustrating Bielsa’s men and taking a point.</p>
