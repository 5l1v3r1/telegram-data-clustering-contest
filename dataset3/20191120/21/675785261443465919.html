      <h2>I'm A Celebrity viewers have hit back at Nadine Coyle's claims after the Girls Aloud star previously insisted she had never been friends with Cheryl on Celebrity Juice</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:35:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author">Kyle O'Sullivan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kyle-osullivan/</a></address>
      <p>Nadine Coyle has been accused of 'lying' about her 'friendship' with former Girl Aloud bandmate Cheryl.</p>
      <p>The Irish singer opened up about her time in the girl band during an intimate chat with Adele Roberts and Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>When the ex-EastEnders star asked if she got on with everyone in Girls Aloud, Nadine said: "Yes."</p>
      <p>Digging deeper, Jacqueline admitted she had heard Nadine "didn't get on with Cheryl".</p>
      <p>Tense Nadine insisted it was "fake news" - but I'm A Celebrity viewers pointed out this went against what she had claimed before.</p>

      <p>Nadine previously blamed the rest of the girls for splitting the band - and even insisted there was never any friendship with Cheryl.</p>
      <p>Despite having been a bridesmaid at Cheryl's lavish 2006 wedding to footballer Ashley Cole - Nadine insisted they'd never been friends at all.</p>
      <p>On Celebrity Juice in 2018, Nadine said: "There was no falling out, there was just no friendship to begin with."</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>, one concerned viewer said: "Think Nadine is a bit of a liar!"</p>
      <p>"Just the passive way Nadine said "oh it's fake news" about her alleged feud with Cheryl," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "Mmmm I don’t think I believe you Nadine"</p>

      <p>Inquisitive Jacqueline also asked Nadine what it was really like to be in a girl band.</p>
      <p>Nadine replied: "Really good, really good, I like being in a girl band. I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I’m used to being around girls."</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actress then asked how the band came about - questioning whether they were put together like Little Mix.</p>

      <p>Nadine said: "The public had voted, it was ITV’s Popstars the Rivals so a girl band and a boy band and the public put us together."</p>
      <p>DJ Adele said she plays Girls Aloud hit 'The Promise' "all the time" on her radio show - describing the track as a "banger".</p>
      <p>The three girls all started singing and dancing to 'The Promise' and singing the song on the way back to camp - with Adele joking if Nadine remembered all the words.</p>

      <p>This comes just one day after Nadine gave some juicy insight into her relationship with the other members of the girl band to Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>She told the Good Morning Britain host she was friends with all of the girls but preferred 'partying in gay bars with ten guys'.</p>
      <p>She told Kate: "Everyone gets on with their lives, I was friends with them all, it was all nice and lovely.</p>
      <p>"But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys, I’d be out partying, me and ten guys, I was having a laugh, I was 18-19 years old."</p>

      <p>Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh, Nicola Roberts and Sarah Harding split up in 2013 after their Ten: The Hits Tour and Nadine was quick to blame her fellow bandmates.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: "You should know by now I had no part in any of this split business. I couldn't stop them. I had the best time &amp; want to keep going."</p>
      <p>But Cheryl vigorously denied Nadine's claims and insisted she was telling "porkie pies".</p>
      <p>"She's full of sh**. What d'you want us to say? She's full of s***. She was the one who wanted to make a solo record. Which is why we took the hiatus," she told Attitude magazine, referencing the three year break they took from 2009.</p>
