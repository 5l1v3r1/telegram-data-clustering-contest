      <h1>Fury after ex-Scots rugby star and famed fertility doctor's 'sexist remarks' at Glasgow University rugby club dinner</h1>
      <h2>Guests say Roger Baird and Dr Bobby Low both made lewd sexist remarks causing people to walk out of the Glasgow University Rugby Club's 150th anniversary dinner.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:02:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>An ex-Scottish rugby ace and a retired fertility doctor sparked fury after claims they made a string of sexist remarks at a posh dinner for Glasgow University's Rugby Club.</p>
      <p>Guest speakers Roger Baird and Dr Bobby Low left attendees shocked as they addressed the crowd at the club's 150th anniversary dinner at the swanky Hilton hotel in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> . </p>
      <p>Former Scottish internationalist Baird is alleged to have referred to "girls in short skirts bending over" and quipped about the women's captain having to "strip down" for Low ahead of each season.</p>
      <p>Guests claim his speech was littered with sexist comments before he was 'heckled from the stage'.</p>
      <p>It is understood guests threw bread rolls at the stage and others walked out of the bash. </p>
      <p>When club president Dr Low - who has now reportedly stepped down from his role in the wake of the row - introduced the head of the Scottish Rugby Union, Dee Bradbury, he apparently assured the crowd she would 'keep her clothes on'.</p>

      <p>Stunned members of the women's side told how the went on to say he'd like to be their president because of their 'good looks'.</p>
      <p>Writing in the evening's programme, 79-year-old obstetrician Low had hailed women's rugby as the club's "most significant change" in its history of "highs and lows".</p>
      <p>When asked to defend his comments, Baird is believed to have brushed off his remarks as "locker room chat" and said any offence caused was due to "generational differences".</p>
      <p>Emma Little, who walked out of the bash over the comments, posted on Facebook: "I refused to support or celebrate Bobby Low - a man who thinks it is acceptable to introduce the president of the SRU by assuring us that she is going to keep her clothes on.</p>
      <p>"Roger Baird identified our president by name for the sole purpose of implying that she had been made to get naked and I presume have physical relations with Bobby Low.</p>
      <p>"He then proceeded to complete a speech littered with sexist remarks.</p>
      <p>“When asked to defend his choice of content, he chalked it up to locker room chat and generational differences.</p>
      <p>"This has never been an excuse."</p>

      <p>Bobby Low was one of the country's top obstetricians and was widely regarded as Scotland's 'grandfather of fertility'.</p>
      <p>He worked at the Nuffield Health Glasgow Hospital, a site he helped open in 1985, before retiring in 2012.</p>
      <p>Sophie Matthews, president of the women's club, also spoke at the dinner and was there during his and Baird's comments.</p>
      <p>She took to social media, posting: "The words and actions of guest speakers Dr Bobby Low, famed obstetrician, as well as Roger Baird, former British and Irish Lion and Scotland Internationalist, go against everything Scottish Rugby stands for.</p>
      <p>"There is no circumstance in which a woman, regardless of position, age or skin colour, should be spoken to as an object and not as a human being.</p>
      <p>"It is wholly unnecessary to comment that the audience now has to 'listen to a woman with her clothes on'.</p>
      <p>"It is distasteful at best and utterly unacceptable to fathom, much less to say out aloud, that the 'women’s team captain has to strip down for the president for a once over at the start of the season'.</p>
      <p>"We do not live in a society where this vile misogyny, abuse of power, frank disregard for and disrespect of individuals due to their sex should be tolerated any longer, or let to fly under the radar, unopposed."</p>
      <p>Both the Men's and Women's clubs, supported by the University of Glasgow, apologised for any offence caused.</p>

      <p>They also confirmed an emergency meeting had been called to deal with the incident.</p>
      <p>A statement read: "We would like to unreservedly apologise to those who attended the 150th Anniversary Rugby Club Dinner on Saturday, November 16 and who may have been offended by some of the speeches.</p>
      <p>"As rugby clubs we were shocked and appalled at elements of the content which in no way reflect our values or beliefs.</p>
      <p>"To repeat, the views that were expressed - regardless of whether it was an attempt at humour - have no place in our clubs, our sports department or our university.</p>
      <p>"Saturday should have been about celebrating a great anniversary and marking the progress that has been made in both the men's and women's game.</p>
      <p>"We are extremely disappointed and will not allow outdated views and attitudes within our clubs which are open and welcoming to all students of the University of Glasgow."</p>
      <p>A statement posted on the university's official Twitter page reads: "We were extremely disappointed and saddened to hear about some elements of the event.</p>
      <p>"These in no way reflect the values or beliefs of the sports clubs, or the University.</p>
      <p>"We are proud to be an inclusive and welcoming organisation."</p>
      <p>Dr Bobby Low told the Record: “The women’s rugby team are an excellent part of the organisation and I unreservedly apologise to anyone who was offended by any comments made."</p>
      <p>Roger Baird has been contacted for comment.</p>
