      <h2>PM criticizes Blue and White leader after he returns mandate to president, says two leaders will succeed if they work together.</h2>

      <p>Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu responded Wednesday evening to Blue and White leader Benny Gantz, who <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271992">returned the mandate</a> to form the government to President Reuven Rivlin.</p>
      <p>"Benny Gantz, I will not address all the outlandish things you said about me tonight and your failure to form a unity government. It's not because you insisted on breaking up the [right-wing] bloc. After all, as Aryeh Deri revealed, you yourself turned to the haredi parties and tried to coax them all in to join your [government]. You were ready to form a minority government with terrorist supporters who receive their guidance from Israel's enemies. So let's not tell stories," Netanyahu said.</p>
      <p>He said a unity government is the only solution to the current political deadlock. "One thing you said is true, Israel needs a unity government. Everyone sees what we stand for today. We are in a campaign against Iran on different fronts. We must never lose a moment."</p>
      <p>"I answer you as follows: I am ready, without preconditions, to enter into an immediate discourse with you this evening to form a unity government. If we go together - we will succeed," Netanyahu concluded.</p>
