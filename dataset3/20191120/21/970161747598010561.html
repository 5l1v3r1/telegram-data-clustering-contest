      <p>The Walking Dead star Khary Payton has gone and served us all with a throwback to the time he was on Hannah Montana.</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s right, the 47-year-old who has stolen our hearts with his portrayal of the character King Ezekiel also featured in the kidsâ€™ TV programme.</p>
      <p>And we canâ€™t lie, itâ€™s a lot to process.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the actor shared the snap of himself on set while posing alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a>.</p>
      <p>In the caption, he wrote: â€˜I was young &amp; needed the moneyâ€¦ for a haircut! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Â #HannahMontana.â€™</p>

      <p>Fans were quick to comment, and couldnâ€™t believe what they had just laid their eyes on.</p>
      <p>â€˜Omg I never knew you were in Hannah Montana,â€™ one wrote while another added: â€˜Oh daaaaang ! Before the kingâ€™s dreads grew all the way in.â€™</p>

      <p>Someone else said: â€˜Waitâ€¦.WHAAAAAAAAT my mind is officially blown.â€™</p>
      <p>But it seems the star has had a serious glow up, as his new do in The Walking Dead is complete goals â€“ however, he might be in need of a new job soon, as it appears his time as the king is almost up.</p>

      <p>Thatâ€™s right, the much-loved character recently revealed he was battling thyroid cancer, as she showed his buddy Siddiq (Avi Nash) a large lump forming on his neck.</p>
      <p>â€˜I know what it is,â€™ he told the Hilltop doctor: â€˜Growing up, my grandfather went through it and my father. The pain, coughing, swelling â€“ I watched them fight it and win.â€™</p>
      <p>He added: â€˜Did you know thyroid cancer has a 98 per cent survival rate? Different times. Times of sorcery and witchcraft. Chemo, iodine radiation therapy, thyroidectomies.â€™</p>
      <p>Since then, Siddiq has been brutally killed off by the Whisperers â€“ meaning Ezekielâ€™s illness remains a secret.</p>
      <p>But will he end up telling his ex-wife Carol?</p>
