      <p>I'm A Celebrity's Nadine Coyle opened up on tonight's show about her feud with former bandmate Cheryl.</p>
      <p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebritys-nadine-coyle-opens-17283071">Nadine spoke about the band</a> and how she doesn't really see them any more because "everyone gets on with their lives."</p>
      <p>She told Kate Garraway <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/cheryls-swipe-itv-im-celebrity-17278467">she was friends with the girls</a> , but spent more time out in the "gay bars partying with the guys."</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-host-emily-atack-17284384">today's show</a> Nadine, Adele and Jacqueline chatted by the Jungle creek and conversation soon turned to Girls Aloud.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline asked Nadine if she could ask her a question and Nadine said: “Of course.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline asked Nadine what it was like being in a girl band.</p>
      <p>Nadine said: “Really good, really good, I like being in a girl band.  I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I’m used to being around girls.”</p>

      <p>Jacqueline asked if Girls Aloud were put together like Little Mix.</p>
      <p>Nadine said: "The public had voted, it was ITV’s Popstars the Rivals so a girl band and a boy band and the public put us together.”</p>

      <p>Jacqueline asked Nadine if she got on with everyone in Girls Aloud, Nadine said: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said: “I’d heard you didn’t get on with Cheryl" and Nadine said: “Fake news.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline then asked Adele if she’d ever played Girls Aloud on her radio show and Adele said “All the time, The Promise, a banger.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline, Nadine and Adele all started singing and dancing to The Promise.</p>
      <p>They walked back to camp still singing ‘The Promise’, Adele joked if Nadine remembered all the words.</p>
