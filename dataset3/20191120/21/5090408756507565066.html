      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/gender-pay-gap">gender pay gap</a> between men and women in the US is still a big problem, and it affects some women more than others.</p>
      <p>By one measure, November 20, 2019, is “equal pay day” for Latina women in the US. That is, Wednesday marks the day when the typical Hispanic or Latina female worker would have earned as much in 2018 and 2019 to date as the typical white male worker would have earned in 2018 alone.</p>
      <p>That estimate is based on an analysis of <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.pdf">wage data from the US Census Bureau</a> done by the <a href="https://www.aauw.org/article/pay-gap-for-latinas/">American Association of University Women</a>. According to that report, median annual wages for full-time, year-round employed Latina women were 53% of median wages for similarly situated non-Hispanic white men in 2017.</p>
      <p>A little bit of arithmetic shows that this means it takes the median Latina worker about 689 days to earn what the median white male worker makes in 365 days. So, a Latina woman starting on January 1, 2018, would have finally earned today what a white man would have made over the course of 2018.</p>
      <p>The gender wage gap varies widely across different racial and ethnic groups in the US, reflecting the interplay of ongoing gender and racial inequalities. According to the AAUW analysis, non-Hispanic white women’s median earnings were 77% of non-Hispanic white men’s earnings; Asian women made 85% of what white men made; and Black women earned just 61%.</p>
      <p>Across all racial and ethnic groups, full-time, year-round women’s median earnings were 80% of men’s median earnings.</p>
      <p>Here’s when an “equal pay day” would fall for each of those groups in 2019, according to our calculations with results from the AAUW’s report:</p>
