And it doesn’t look like the original film is done racking up accolades just yet. Via <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/grammy-nominations-2020-see-full-list-of-nominees-here/">Pitchfork</a>, the movie will continue its awards push into 2020 at the annual Grammys ceremony.</p>
      <p><b>Into the Spider-Verse</b> will compete in three different categories at next year’s Grammys. Rapper Post Malone received two of these nods for “Sunflower,” which Miles Morales sang along to at various points in the film. The track, which featured guest vocals from Swae Lee, also served as the movie’s theme song. “Sunflower” earned nominations for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.</p>
