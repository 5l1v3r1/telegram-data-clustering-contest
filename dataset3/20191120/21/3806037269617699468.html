      <p><a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/dram">DRAM</a> is hoping to stir up some holiday cheer with his latest release. Following up his August collaboration with H.E.R., <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/dram-her-the-lay-down-song-stream">“The Lay Down,”</a> the talented singer-songwriter is introducing a new holiday record produced by the duo of Josh Abraham &amp; Oligee, “Litmas.” DRAM is also no stranger to festive Christmas tunes either, having released the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2017/11/dram-1epicholiday-ep-stream"><i>#1EpicHoliday</i> EP</a> back in November of 2017.</p>
      <p>“Love on the holidays (Let’s spread the good vibes) / Don’t forget the cookies for Santa (Let’s get the good kind) / Love on the holidays (Let’s spread the good vibes) / More love is on the way (And it’s the good kind),” DRAM sings on “Litmas.” “Cause we can deck the halls (Every day, every day, every day) / And hang the mistletoe (Every day, every day, every day) / It can be Christmas, ayy (Every day, every day, every day) / We can celebrate Christmas, ayy (Every day, every day, every day).”</p>
