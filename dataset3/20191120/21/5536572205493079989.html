      <h1>Petition For Patriots To Re-Sign Antonio Brown Reaches Over 10K After His Apology</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:15:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, Antonio Brown shocked everybody with a sudden change in his behavior when he took to Instagram and Twitter and formally apologized to Robert Kraft and the Patriots organization for the way he conducted himself during his short stay with the team.</p>
      <p>The Patriots are doing just fine without him at 9-19, but the offense is not the well-oiled machine that they used to be without having Rob Gronkowski in the line-up, Josh Gordon has been released, and Brown only lasted one game before getting cut.</p>
      <p>It was last month when a petition popped up from Patriots fans that asked for fans to sign and support so the franchise would consider re-signing Brown to the squad.</p>
      <p>Well, after releasing his apology, the fans went right back to that petiion and kept signing to the point that it is now over 10k signatures.</p>
      <p>It <a href="https://www.change.org/p/mr-robert-kraft-and-the-patriots-organization-robert-kraft-and-the-patriots-re-sign-antonio-brown?recruiter=73760419&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_message&amp;recruited_by_id=ee369c20-68c1-11e3-bfe5-6590e4f18ab4&amp;share_bandit_exp=message-18316790-en-US&amp;share_bandit_var=v3&amp;fbclid=IwAR3I3E6SYxEERyxySNAnrTbFCwXaqDyTds-N9vXT60H_lVVuq5fRWc0nzGs">reads as</a>:</p>
      <p>“It is clear to Patriots Nation that Tom Brady was excited to have him and upset when he was released. The offense has struggled at times and the 42 year old greatest qb of all time needs a receiver of Brown’s caliber to take the offense to a level we haven’t seen since 2007. Along with that historic defense, there is no telling what this team will be able to accomplish this season.</p>
      <p>Antonio Brown was signed by the Patriots for a $1 Million salary with a $9 Million sign on bonus. It is evident that Brown will likely win his grievance with the Patriots over that bonus which means the Patriots suffer a $9 Million cap hit this year.</p>
      <p>Antonio Brown should publicly apologize for his tweet about Mr Kraft. AB also needs to make sure all future actions and social media posts adhere to professional standards ie “The Patriots Way.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kraft should allow Bill Belichick to bring him back on a conditional basis. Whatever Coach Belichick and the organization requires in the new deal to feel comfortable allowing him to return to practice and represent the Patriots, those conditions need to be strictly adhered to by Antonio Brown.</p>
      <p>We as fans want to see Antonio Brown back on the team and witness the Patriots go 19-0 to make up for the great injustice that occurred at the end of the 07 season.”</p>
