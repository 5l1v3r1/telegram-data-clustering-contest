      <p><b>Kurt Russell</b> and <b>Goldie Hawn</b> haven’t split after decades of being together, but exactly one year ago today, a tabloid falsely claimed they broke up. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the false reporting when it first emerged. The two are still happily together one year later.</p>
      <p>On November 20, 2019, <i><b>OK!</b></i> claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/goldie-hawn-kurt-russell-split-call-quits-35-years/">Russell and Hawn had decided to break up</a> after more than 35 years together. According to the tabloid’s dubious sources, things were “tense” in the relationship, and the couple had been living entirely separate lives for the better part of a year. The two were just too tired of “the lies, betrayals and constant fighting” and ultimately “made the painful decision” to call it all off, the outlet claimed. The fights mostly started in 2017, the source said, with the two bickering over “both of their rumored affairs.”</p>
      <p>Funnily enough, the week that the tabloid published its bogus article, both Hawn and Russell attended the premiere of <i>The Christmas Chronicles</i>, a Netflix film that starred Russell as Santa Claus and featured Hawn as Mrs. Claus. The longtime couple attended the event along with the rest of their family. The entire group looked happy, but Hawn and Russell seemed especially content together. Hawn even said that she and Russell were already planning their family’s Christmas vacation.</p>
      <p>Now that a full year has passed and nothing from the magazine’s article has come to fruition, <b>Gossip Cop</b> can confidently say that we got it right. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7666455/Kurt-Russells-image-Santa-Claus-takes-love-Goldie-Hawn-son-Wyatt-breakfast.html">Russell and Hawn were seen getting breakfast with their son</a>, Wyatt, where all seemed normal. Russell was even sporting his full Santa beard as he and Hawn are currently filming <i>The Christmas Chronicles 2</i> together. Judging by the fact they’re happily playing a couple that has been together for what seems like forever, we think it’s safe to assume they’re as happy as the Hollywood equivalent of the mythical couple.</p>
      <p>Other tabloids, however, refuse to acknowledge the strength of the couple’s relationship. This past June, the <i>Globe</i>, a sister publication of <i>OK!</i>, claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/goldie-hawn-kurt-russell-save-romance-vacation/">Russell and Hawn were trying to save their romance</a> after years of supposed fights. <b>Gossip Cop</b> also busted the <i>National Enquirer</i>, another sister outlet of the two tabloids, for publishing a bogus story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/goldie-hawn-kurt-russell-demanding-marry-her/">Hawn demanding Russell marry her or she’ll leave him</a>. As we mentioned, the longstanding couple is perfectly fine as they are: in love, unmarried and happy. These various articles alleging otherwise are just baseless.</p>
