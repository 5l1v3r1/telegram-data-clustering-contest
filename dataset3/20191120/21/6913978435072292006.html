      <p><b>PARIS —</b> Garrett Anderson has never known the pleasure of holding hands with both his children at the same time.<br/><br/>While deployed in Iraq with the US army in 2005, a bomb blast shot shrapnel through his right arm, severing it just below the elbow.<br/><br/>Today, the Illinois-based retired veteran wears a prosthetic which allows him to pick up objects and have basic mobility.<br/><br/>But it cannot duplicate the sense of touch.<br/><br/>A new second-skin "virtual reality" technology — designed to work with both prosthetics and gaming applications — may change that.<br/><br/>The system, developed by researchers at Northwestern University and described in the journal Nature, incorporates 32 individually programmable actuators — a device that emits electric impulses or vibrations — which are embedded into a pliable material made from silicone that adheres to the skin.<br/><br/>Controlled by a wireless touchscreen such as a smartphone or tablet, each actuator — the size of a small coin -- vibrates to create the perception of touch. The user can control the pressure and the pattern of the sensation.<br/><br/>Anderson tried the system, integrated with his prosthetic. While wearing a patch on his skin, he could feel sensations from his prosthetic fingertips transmitted to his arm.<br/><br/>Over time, the brain converts that sensation to what researcher John Rogers describes as a "surrogate sense of feeling".<br/><br/>The authors say the device could also be used for social interactions, offering a stroke of an arm to a loved one during a video call, or a pat of encouragement to a teammate during a virtual game.<br/><br/>"Our sense of touch provides the most profound, deepest, emotional connection between people," Rogers said in a statement.<br/><br/>In the study, published Wednesday, the authors described a scenario in which a young girl touches her grandmother's hand during a video call.<br/><br/>"We are interested in fine touch -- a finger stroke across the arm or shoulder, or a pattern of sensation that can reproduce a surrogate of touch," Rogers told AFP.<br/><br/>The device is wireless and does not require battery power. It uses the same near-field communication protocols found in smartphone banking applications, such as Apple Pay.<br/><br/>"With this wireless power delivery scheme, we completely avoid the need for batteries, with their weight, size, bulk and limited operating lifetimes," Rogers said. "The result is a thin, lightweight system that can be worn and used without constraint, indefinitely."<br/><br/>For Anderson, the technology may finally allow him to simultaneously clasp the hands of his children, aged 13 and 10.<br/><br/>But it will also have practical applications, such as being able to sense how much force he's applying when gripping a fragile object or touching someone.<br/><br/>"I remember when I was first injured, I grabbed my mom's hand and almost broke it because I did not know the amount of pressure I was using," Anderson told AFP.<br/><br/>Rogers said his aim is to improve quality of life, and that working with Anderson was "a deeply moving experience."<br/><br/>The prototype is only a first attempt, and researchers are working to make the device lighter and slimmer.<br/><br/>In the future, they would also like to explore thermal inputs, which will allow someone with a prosthetic hand to feel how hot or cold a drink is.<br/><br/>"When I explain to others how it works they are floored by what people are able to develop," Anderson said. — AFP</p>
