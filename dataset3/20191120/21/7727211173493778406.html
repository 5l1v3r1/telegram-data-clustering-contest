      <h1>Liverpool wonderkid Trent Alexander-Arnold given major upgrade on FIFA 20</h1>
      <h2>EA SPORTS have released the latest database update for FIFA 20, with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:30:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Bliss</a></address>
      <p>After a short hiatus thanks to the international break, Liverpool are back in Premier League action on Saturday, as they face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>The Reds have been in phenomenal form so far this season, winning 11 of their first 12 Premier League games, without a defeat so far, and find themselves eight points clear of second place side Leicester City.</p>
      <p>Defender <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/trent-alexander-arnold">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> has played a major part in the club's form, showcasing his incredible ability on the ball.</p>
      <p>And, in EA SPORTS' latest FIFA 20 database update, they've upgraded Alexander-Arnold's attributes to reflect his real-life form.</p>
      <p>However, there is one notable attribute downgrade too.</p>
      <h4>Trent Alexander-Arnold - Upgrade</h4>

      <p><b>Overall ability:</b> 83</p>
      <p><b>Potential:</b> 89</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been given a big upgrade to his technical attributes, with his crossing (90-91), long passing (82-86), long shots (63-68), short passing (81-83) and vision (78-80) all boosted on the game.</p>
      <p>But, somewhat harshly, his marking attribute has been downgraded from 80 to 76, which is a significant change.</p>
      <p>Overall though, the young defender is now even better to use on the new game, especially in possession and will be a major part of many gamer's career mode saves.</p>
