      <h3>‘Joker’ Sequel Is Not Confirmed, According To ‘Deadline’ Report</h3>
      <p>

      <p>Although a report from <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> suggests that director Todd Phillips is speaking to Warner Bros. about a direct sequel to the billion-dollar-grossing film <i>Joker</i>, a subsequent <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/"><i>Deadline</i></a> report says otherwise. The new report cites “multiple inside sources” who reportedly suggest that there are currently no deals for a sequel and no negotiations with Phillips or his co-writer, Scott Silver.</p>
      <p>The <i>Deadline</i> report also disputes the <i>Reporter’s</i> claim that Phillips pitched multiple <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/dc-comics">DC Comics</a> character origin stories to Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich, suggesting that Phillips doesn’t want to follow <i>Joker</i> with other DC character films. According to the sources, Phillips spoke about a DC Black initiative during <i>Joker’s</i> inception but chose to focus on the latter movie.</p>
      <p>“No one is saying a <i>Joker</i> sequel won’t happen someday,” the report reads. “But multiple sources said nothing has happened yet and that Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver have made no real moves to draft the further dark rise of Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck character, or even to make a deal to do that.”</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> has been a commercial and critical success, becoming the United States’ biggest October release ever and the first movie with an R rating to exceed $1 billion at the global box office. The film also earned a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joker-sequel-movie-false-news-todd-phillips-dc-origin-stories-1473069?utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social"><i>Newsweek</i></a> reports.</p>

      <p>Although Phillips might not actively be in talks with Warner Bros. about a <i>Joker</i> sequel, he has discussed where a potential follow-up would go in terms of story, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joker-director-todd-phillips-details-direction-potential-sequel-2567644"><i>NME</i></a> reports.</p>

      <blockquote>“It couldn’t just be this wild and crazy movie about the ‘Clown Prince of Crime.’ It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that [<i>Joker</i>] does.”</blockquote>
      <p>According to Phillips, the movie connected with people due to such resonance — what he referred to as “what’s going on underneath.” While he says many movies are about “the spark,” the <i>Joker</i> is reportedly about “the powder.” If Phillips were able to “capture” such powder again in a “real way,” he says it would be “interesting.”</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5725140/joaquin-phoenix-joker-sequel/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported, <i>Joker</i> star Joaquin Phoenix commented on a sequel to the film while speaking to <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> earlier this month<i>.</i> The 45-year-old actor revealed that he spoke to Phillips about working on a sequel during the second or third week of shooting the movie. According to Phoenix, he believed there was “way too much to explore.” Phoenix went on to suggest that the comment has partially serious and partially in jest.</p>
