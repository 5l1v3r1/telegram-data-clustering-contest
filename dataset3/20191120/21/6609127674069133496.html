      <p>Fellow guest speaker Roger Baird, 59 - an ex Scotland player - was also criticised over his speech at the Glasgow University event on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Horrified guests jeered the pair and pelted them with rolls during offensive jokes storm, sources said tonight.</p>
      <p>Ex-Scotland star Baird was targeted with the bread snack after allegedly provoking outrage with a gag about the Japanese.</p>
      <p>And Glasgow University RFC president Dr Bobby Low, 80 — who has now quit — is said to have shocked around 450 revellers with a comment about “ugly lesbians giving birth”.</p>
      <p>A source said of the posh bash: “The atmosphere in the room certainly turned sour during some of the speeches. There was booing and quite a bit of heckling going on.</p>
      <p>“The speakers seemed totally oblivious to it and just ploughed on regardless.</p>

        <figcaption>Ex-Scotland star Roger Baird was also accused of making tasteless jokes</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“It has to be said, there were many others who didn’t take offence.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the guests have been to this sort of do before and the speeches are normally near the knuckle.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t make it right but that’s the reality of certain after-dinner events.”</p>
      <p>The event, at Glasgow’s Hilton Hotel, was hosted by the uni’s men’s and women’s teams to celebrate the club’s 150th anniversary.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed former British Lions winger Baird, from Kelso, Roxburghshire, cra­cked a joke about residents from nearby Selkirk and the Japanese.</p>
      <p>Retired IVF expert and consultant gy­naecologist Dr Low, of Bearsden, near Glasgow, is also all­eged to have made fun of Scottish Rugby Union president Dee Bradbury by assuring she would “keep her clothes on” as he introduced her to the crowd.</p>
      <p>The alleged remarks are understood to have upset guests at the top table, including ex-Scots international and BBC Scotland presenter John Beattie.</p>
      <p>Student Emma Little, who is believed to have played for the women’s rugby side, slammed the pair’s behaviour on social media.</p>

      <p>She wrote on Facebook: “The comments made both during speeches and to individual members of the club were utterly unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“The majority of the room were openly disgusted.</p>
      <p>“I refused to support or celebrate Bobby Low — a man who thinks it is acceptable to introduce the president of the SRU by assuring us that she is going to keep her clothes on.</p>
      <p>“The gynaecologist/obstetrician also thinks it’s fine two women have a baby but it’s a shame it’s always the ugly one, and who wouldn’t mind being OUR president because he finds us physically attractive.”</p>

      <p>Emma added: “I also refuse to ignore the fact that the keynote speaker, Roger Baird, identified our president by name for the sole purpose of implying that she had been made to get naked and I presume have physical relations with the aforementioned Bobby Low.</p>
      <p>“He proceeded to complete a speech littered with sexist and racist remarks.</p>
      <p>“When asked to defend his choice of content he chalked it up to locker room chat and generational differences. This has never been an excuse.”</p>
      <p>The men’s and women’s clubs issued a joint statement condemning the antics.</p>

      <p>And they revealed they are set to hold crisis talks at an emergency meeting following Saturday’s bash.</p>
      <p>The statement read: “We would like to unreservedly apologise to those who attended the 150th anniversary dinner and who may have been offended by some of the speeches.</p>
      <p>“As rugby clubs we were shocked and appalled at elements of the content which in no way reflect our values or beliefs.”</p>
      <p>Glasgow University sought to distance itself from the evening by making clear it wasn’t a uni gathering.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: “We were extremely disappointed and saddened to hear about some elements of the event.”</p>
      <blockquote>The majority of the room were openly disgusted."<cite>Emma Little, Glasgow University student</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Tonight, Dr Low denied saying anything offensive as he admitted he had resigned as club president after half a century. He told a female reporter: “I was very surprised to hear about this, knowing my views on women. I love you lot, I couldn’t look after men.</p>
      <p>“My business is women so I wouldn’t set out to offend any of them.</p>
      <p>“Maybe people were on the drink but I was sober that night, I wasn’t drinking.</p>
      <p>“I think it was some of the university girls that were wanting to make an issue of it. As far as I was aware, it was a fun night, that’s the kind of evening it was.</p>
      <p>“I resigned from the club because I just thought it was easier, I couldn’t be bothered with it.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sad, I was there 50 years. It is a world record.”</p>
      <p>Baird claimed he had “misjudged” the crowd with his comments. He said in a statement: “I apologise for any offence caused.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t my intention to upset or insult anyone, and I regret misjudging the mood of the room.</p>
      <p>“The remarks which seem to have caused particular offence relate to a long-standing nickname for people who come from the town of Selkirk and was in no way intended as a derogatory reference to Selkirk or Japanese people.</p>
      <p>“Similarly, none of my speech was intended to be sexist or homophobic, and I apologise if anything I said was regarded as such.”</p>
