      <h1>Lucasfilm President Laments Lack of Comic Book Material to Adapt to Film</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> films have spawned additional stories in other media over the years, including comic books. For all the wealth of material, though, it's of little use when developing a new movie, according to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.</p>
      <p>"Every one of these movies is a particularly hard nut to crack," Kennedy said in an <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/lucasfilm-president-kathleen-kennedy-interview-rise-skywalker-future-star-wars-912393/">interview with Rolling Stone</a>. "There’s no source material. We don’t have comic books. We don’t have 800-page novels. We don’t have anything other than passionate storytellers who get together and talk about what the next iteration might be."</p>

      <p>Kennedy went on to discuss the challenges of finding the right filmmakers capable of developing a new Star Wars film from scratch, and likewise the challenges these filmmakers face in developing the stories.</p>
      <p>"I feel really fortunate that I’ve worked with so many great people that have been absolutely committed, J.J. [Abrams] being one of them," Kennedy said. "He’s a huge fan, incredibly passionate about Star Wars, and has been from the moment he and I sat down and started talking about this."</p>
      <p>Decades worth of comics would certainly serve as fertile ground for mining, should any <i>Star Wars</i> screenwriter ever choose. The very first Marvel comic in 1977 actually predated the first film. And save for a five year stretch beginning in the mid-'80s, Star Wars comics have been published ever since.</p>
