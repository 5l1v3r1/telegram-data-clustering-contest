      <p>I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! Adele Roberts understandably struggled to keep down camel anus and vomit fruit in the first bushtucker trial of the series.</p>
      <p>Adele and fellow radio DJ Roman Kemp were faced with the Just Desserts challenge in a jungle themed ice cream parlour.</p>
      <p>Each camp mate was presented with a different ‘dessert’ which they had to scoff to win meals for the camp.</p>
      <p>Roman took on a meal of dead cockroaches, crickets and mealworms, eating three of each to gain a star for camp.</p>
      <p>He described the crickets as being like ‘quite cheesy, cheesy eggs’ which sounded pretty grim.</p>
      <p>Adele was then given vomit fruit to eat, and as she gagged and retched, she said: ‘It’s like your dog’s been sick and you have to eat it.’</p>
      <p>She was also served up turkey testicles and swore off turkey as she managed to eat them and win a star, and a pig’s uterus which popped as she chewed. Luckily she had Roman and her love for Jane McDonald to push her through.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Roman advised her: ‘Swallow the juice, focus on the chew. Think how proud Jane is going to be.</p>

      <p>Gagging again Adele managed to finish it and got a bit of respite while Roman tackled fish eyes.</p>
      <p>The next treat was a sheep’s foot that went down easily, and lastly a camel’s anus. Pretending that Jane was there spurring her on, she ate the bushtucker and scored their tenth star.</p>
      <p>Having bagged meals for everyone in camp, she told Roman: ‘Lovely first date. Thanks very much.’</p>

      <p>Adele raised some eyebrows in the camp when she chose a framed photo of Jane as her luxury item.</p>

      <p>But Jane is loving the fact she has a super fan, and sent a message of support to Adele during a break from filming the new series of her show Jane &amp; Friends.</p>
