      <p>TORONTO — The Toronto Maple Leafs have fired coach Mike Babcock.</p>
      <p>Team President Brendan Shanahan announced the move Wednesday and said Sheldon Keefe would take over as coach.</p>
      <p>In parts of five seasons under Babcock, the Maple Leafs posted a record of 173-133-45 in 351 regular-season games and an 8-12 record in three postseason appearances.</p>
