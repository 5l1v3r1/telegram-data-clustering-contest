      <p>I am one of many people across Canada who is a diehard Saskatchewan Roughriders fan, even though I no longer live in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Now, I realize that there is no such thing as a “guaranteed win” (Joe Namath notwithstanding). Every game that I watch, I hope the Riders will win, but it would be beyond foolish to expect them to win every game or indeed any particular game.</p>
      <p>But a strange thing happened on Sunday. For the first time in my life — and it’s not a short one — I went to bed angry as the result of watching a Riders game.</p>
      <p>I’ve been disappointed before — like the time they lost the Grey Cup because of too many men.</p>
      <p>Disappointed, yes. Angry, no.</p>
      <p>But Sunday was different. During the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-moving-on-after-west-division-final-loss">West Division final against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers</a>, I watched the Riders go first-and-goal on three different occasions, the combined result of which was six points.</p>
      <p>It occurred to me that it wasn’t their failure to score a TD in Sunday’s game that got in my craw. It was <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-poor-play-calling-was-the-saskatchewan-roughriders-undoing">how they failed to score.</a></p>
      <p>Rather than rely on one of the best backs in the game (William Powell) to run it in, they chose to get cute. Twice.</p>
      <p>I know it’s always easy to be an armchair coach and hindsight is always 20-20, but it seems like it was coaching and not the performance of the players that determined the outcome of this game, won 20-13 by Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>I’ll leave it up to the powers that be to determine what to do about that.</p>
