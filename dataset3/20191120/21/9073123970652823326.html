      <h1>Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1 secret skin leaked</h1>

        <b>The secret skin for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1 has been revealed. Take a look at it here.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fortnite Chapter 2 might not be as close to ending as we thought. Recent information shows that Season 1 has been extended into <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-end-date-has-been-extended/27880/">February of next year.</a> Nevertheless, the Fortnite team will likely take a break from the holidays while we complete some Overtime challenges they inevitably give us.</p>
      <p>We’re now into week 7 of the first Chapter 2 season, which means only two more secret letters to find in the weekly loading screens. Once we have them all, we’ll unlock the Season 1 secret skin for Fortnite Chapter 2.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Epic released the <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-v11-20-update-official-patch-notes-revealed/27875/">v11.20 patch</a> today, November 20, which looks to be one of the final patches of the season. Data miners were able to get their hands on a plethora of cosmetic leaks, including what will be the secret skin for this Fortnite season.</p>

      <p>As you can see, the Sorana skin – code-named “Bane” – will have three unlockable styles that will likely have you completing specific missions as you play Fortnite.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Is this the most exciting secret skin Epic has ever released? No, but it’s one of my favorites. I like the female Fortnite skins (aka “sweaty” skins). The big, bulky, busy skins have never been my preference.</p>
      <p>A lot of players have noted that this one looks a bit more like an 800 V-Bucks skin you’d find in the Item Shop rather than a secret skin of Legendary rarity. There’s some truth in this, but there may be some unlockable styles that we aren’t seeing just yet.</p>

      <p>If the Battle Pass is truly extended into February, Epic will probably give us plenty of challenges over that time. Who knows, this lady might come with more than the three outfits we see here.</p>
