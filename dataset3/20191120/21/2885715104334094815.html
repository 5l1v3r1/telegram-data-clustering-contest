      <p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notice to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on a petition by former Union minister P Chidambaram challenging the Delhi High Court order dismissing his bail plea in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/chidambaram-inx-media-scam-case-explained-karti-5921402/">INX Media</a> money laundering case.</p>
      <p>A bench headed by Justice R Banumathi issued the notice and fixed November 26 to hear the matter next.</p>
      <p>In his petition, Chidambaram stated that the HC order said that he was neither a flight risk nor was there any chance of him tampering with evidence. He said the only other co-accused to be arrested in the money laundering case, S Bhaskararaman, has already been granted bail.</p>
      <p>Chidambaram said his ED custody was over on October 30, after which he has been in judicial custody and that he was never questioned during this period.</p>
