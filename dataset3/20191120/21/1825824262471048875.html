      <h1>Rumour: 2019-20 Raptors City Edition jerseys are mix of old and new</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Kern</a></address>
      <p>If you thought you could get through another <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/toronto-raptors">Raptors</a> season without wanting to buy yet another new jersey... think again! A leaked photo has shown what purports be the Toronto Raptors 2019-20 City Edition jersey, and they’re looking good:</p>

      <p>Yep: Another season, another new look for your favourite team. But this one is, as the kids say, fire, and I, as the kids also say, might have to cop. (Or am I only allowed to use that term for shoes!? Give this old guy a break.)</p>
      <p>The influences of the past and the present are clear on this City Edition jersey, which is fitting for the team’s 25th anniversary season. The font is clearly inspired by the original Raptors wordmark, as are the pinstripes adorning the side. The black and gold color scheme of course recalls the team’s modern connection to Drake and the OVO brand, aas well as the various black and gold Drake-inspired looks they’ve sported in recent seasons. And it sports the “We The North” motto above the tag as all Raptors jerseys have for the past couple of years.</p>
      <p>All in all, it’s a perfectly appropriate mixture of old and new.</p>
      <p>Best of all though, in my mind, is that the jersey says “Toronto” on the front instead of “Raptors.” It’s been a while since we’ve seen that on a Raptors jersey, and it’s awesome to see it again.</p>
      <p>There’s no word just yet on when these will debut on the court, or how often they’ll be worn — or when you’ll be able to buy your own. We’ll be sure to update you as soon as we get official details.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, hit up our friends over at <a href="http://www.sportslogos.net/index.php">Sportslogos.net</a> — they've got a <a href="http://news.sportslogos.net/2019/11/20/nba-city-edition-uniforms-2019-20/">rundown of all the leaked 2019-20 City jerseys so far</a>, including the rather humorous <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/milwaukee-bucks">Bucks</a> jersey (Cream City? Come on, man), the awesome retro-inspired <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/denver-nuggets">Nuggets</a> jersey, and the utterly ridiculous, graffiti-inspired <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/dallas-mavericks">Mavericks</a> jerseys.</p>
      <p>What do you think? Are the new Raptors City Edition jerseys fire, or dumpster fire?</p>
