      <p>Whether you're shopping for yourself or for someone else, if you're looking for a new laptop, cellphone, or headphones, Cyber Monday is the perfect day to mark on your calendar. The hustle and bustle of Black Friday may be too overwhelming for you, but that doesn't mean you have to miss out on the great tech sales going on. You can sift through the<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-cyber-monday-tech-deals-sales"> best Cyber Monday tech deals</a> all from the comfort of your home, and still end up with just the thing you were looking for at a price that makes you happy.</p>
      <p>Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 2 this year, the Monday right after Thanksgiving Day on Nov. 28 and Black Friday on Nov. 29. While Cyber Monday is technically one day, lots of<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-cyber-monday-tech-deals-sales"> </a>retailers start their deals much earlier and end them later. This means that you're likely to see deals pop up even now. But despite this potentially wide window, it's still important that you check out the deals beforehand and make a plan to ensure that you get all the tech pieces you want or need at the best, possible price.</p>
      <p>Here are the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-find-the-best-cyber-monday-2019-deals/">best Cyber Monday tech deals</a> to look out for all this month and next:</p>
