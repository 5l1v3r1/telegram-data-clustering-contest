      <p>The commission sanctioned the Nat for "disrespectful conduct" after he shared a blog post which claimed GMB Scotland leader Rhea Wolfson was taking advantage of Hitler's fascist ideology for her own gain.</p>
      <p>Jewish Wolfston had been made the subject of abuse on contentious pro-independence website Grouse Beater.</p>
      <p>The blog post named "GMB - a cockney clique" referenced Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf and his views that Jews gradually had took leadership of the trade union movement.</p>
      <p>A post said: “Whether or not Wolfson is intellectually aware of Hitler’s outlook is unknown, but she certainly knows how to make the most of it”.</p>
      <p>The blog's author, Edinburgh-based Gareth Wardell, has since been expelled from the SNP.</p>
      <p>In light of the investigation, Wolfston took to Twitter to air her views of the controversial post.</p>

      <p>The trade-union leader said she "honestly never expected to see such outright support for such obviously anti-Semitic views".</p>
      <p>A complaint was later made about Anderson and the Standards Commission for Scotland held a hearing today.</p>
      <p>Anderson sought to defend his part in supporting the blog, which he shared on his social media.</p>
      <p>The West-Lothian councillor denied it was anti-semitic and claimed: "I don’t accept that it was an anti-Semitic article, nor was I aware of any of Miss Wolfson’s Jewish heritage.</p>
      <p>“The article was, in context, about the self-serving attitude of Labour.”</p>
      <p>He has since backtracked on his denial, offering his "unreserved" apologies</p>
      <p>Following the  Standards Commission's verdict, Anderson has been banned from council meetings for three months.</p>
