      <p>People suffering with poor sleep are being advised to write down their thoughts before bed and put their phones away.</p>
      <p>The latest Healthy Ireland survey finds the average Irish adult is getting seven hours sleep a night, with women more likely than men to have trouble sleeping.</p>
      <p>Students get the most amount of sleep, while those who work or carry out home duties get the least.</p>
      <p>Kate O'Flaherty, head of well-being at the Department of Health, says the survey results are generally positive.</p>
      <p>"It's certainly a good insight for us to see are there ways that we can support people," she said.</p>
      <p>"The nation seem to be telling us they are getting pretty decent sleep."</p>
