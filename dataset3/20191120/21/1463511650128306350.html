      <p>Yahaya said: “He was driving in his personal car around 6:30pm  along Mubi-Maraba Road near the toll gate when he was abducted.</p>
      <p>“There was sound of shooting around the area.”When our men arrived, they met an empty car identified as his.”</p>

      <p>“We are hoping of positive result and I want to use this opportunity to advise members of the public with relevant security information on criminals to avail the command same for necessary action,” Yahaya said.</p>
