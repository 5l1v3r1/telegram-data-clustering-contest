      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has opened up about how she is treated differently as a woman on tonight’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…get Me Out Of Here as she spoke fondly about her fellow campmates in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/11/caitlyn-jenner-liberated-after-gender-reassignment-surgery-and-admits-she-was-tired-of-tucking-it-in-all-the-time-6566938/">who had gender reassignment surgery in 2017</a> appeared in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/caitlyn-jenner-appeared-im-celebrity-us-despite-claiming-doesnt-know-show-works-11076568/">American version of the show back in 2003 as Bruce</a>, and she said as a woman, she is treated differently as she exclaimed ‘this girl thing is working out pretty good’.</p>
      <p>Comparing her time as Bruce Jenner on the American show, Caitlyn explained how she ‘did everything for everyone’ but on the UK show, her campmates are always offering to make her cups of tea.</p>
      <p>‘As Bruce I was doing everything for everyone, but here everyone is offering to make me tea.</p>
      <p>‘This girl thing is working out pretty good’.</p>
      <p>Years before she transitioned, Caitlyn appeared on the US show alongside the likes of entertainment reporter Robin Leach and actress Melissa Rivers.</p>
