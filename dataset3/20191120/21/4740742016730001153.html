      <h1>First look at £120m new Cardiff Parkway station which will run trains to Bristol every 15 minutes</h1>
      <h2>It is hoped there will be four services to Bristol every hour</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:46:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:46</time> by <a rel="author">Sion Barry, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>A new £120 million park and ride station in Wales' capital will run four services to Bristol every hour.</p>
      <p>Under the proposals for the ambitious scheme , bosses hope to launch 12 train services an hour – 24 in and out – including two to London and four to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/temple-meads">Temple Meads</a> - that's one every 15 minutes to our city.</p>
      <p>Cardiff Parkway is expected to welcome more than 800,000 passengers and aims to have significant impact on reducing car congestion, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/cardiff-parkway-train-station-mellons-17284720">Wales Online.</a></p>
      <p>There would be 600 car parking spaces and overflow capacity.</p>
      <p>As well as the station, developers are hoping to build nearly one million square metres of new offices and leisure space, known as Cardiff Hendre Lakes.</p>
      <p>Subject to planning, work on both projects is expected to start next year, with the station and a first phase of 300,000 sq ft of 900,000 sq ft of development at Cardiff Hendre Lakes, completed in 2023.</p>
      <p>Both interconnected projects are being driven by entrepreneur Nigel Roberts and his son Andrew.</p>
      <p>They are being backed by financial services giant Investec and the Welsh Government, which has taken a 10% equity stake in the project.</p>

      <p>Nigel Roberts, executive chairman of Cardiff Parkway Developments, said: “Cardiff Hendre Lakes is an ambitious development that aims to be a catalyst for growth in South Wales by connecting businesses with high quality facilities, people and skills. We also hope to deliver a range of benefits for the local community, including new jobs, better transport and enhanced green spaces.</p>
      <p>“Our plans are at a stage where we want to hear from people in the local community about how the project could benefit them.</p>

      <p>“We will then hold a formal consultation before we submit a planning application next spring. We hope as many people as possible get involved in helping us shape this exciting project for Wales.</p>
      <p>“We will not be building some soulless place in the middle of a field, but providing new road infrastructure, a new train station, public realm and hundreds of thousands of square feet of new office space, with bars and restaurants too. It will also benefit from all the ancillary infrastructure like GP and dental surgeries, a gym and creche facilities.”</p>
      <p>A formal consultation will be launched early next year.</p>
