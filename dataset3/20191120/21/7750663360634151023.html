      <p>After being appointed as the successor to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>, Mourinho has been tipped to make a number of additions at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the Portuguese is prepared to work with the current first-team squad at the north London outfit.</p>
      <p>The report says that Mourinho wants to place more priority on securing the long-term future of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-eriksen/"><b>Christian Eriksen</b></a>, who has less than a year left on his contract.</p>
      <p>The Denmark international is one of several senior players whose deals expire at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take charge of his first game on Saturday as Spurs take on West Ham United at the London Stadium.</p>
