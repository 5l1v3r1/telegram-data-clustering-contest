      <p>After being awarded ‘Media Entrepreneur of the Year’, Mr. Tiwari added, “A lot of work I do I have a lot of pride in because I represent media in minority and culturally undermined parts of society. We have to stand up for smaller media because if we don’t, we will create a unipolar world.”</p>
