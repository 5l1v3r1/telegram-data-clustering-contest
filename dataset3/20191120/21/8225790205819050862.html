      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - A divided House panel has endorsed a proposal to decriminalize and tax marijuana at the federal level.</p>
      <p>Groups supporting an end to the nationâ€™s longstanding prohibition on cannabis call the 24-10 vote by the House Judiciary Committee historic.</p>
      <p>Opponents called the vote Wednesday in Washington a hollow political gesture.</p>
      <p>If the measure comes up for a vote in the full House, it has better chances in the Democratic-controlled chamber than in the GOP-held Senate, where its future is uncertain.</p>
      <p>The proposal would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act and allow states to set their own marijuana policy.</p>
      <p>Marijuana legalization advocates said the vote marked the first time legislation to end the federal prohibition had cleared a congressional committee.</p>
