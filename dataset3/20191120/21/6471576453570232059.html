      <p>The energy is stored in a 38.3-<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/k.html#ge-kilowatt-hour"><u>kWh</u></a> battery, up from 28 kWh in the pre-facelift model. The <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/nissan-leaf-battery-will-outlast-the-vehicle-by-up-to-12-years-134783.html">Nissan Leaf</a> with the 40-kWh battery can’t do better than 150 miles between charge-ups, and that stands as proof that Hyundai did well with this update.</p>
      <p>Pricing information has yet to be announced, yet the 2019 model is still listed on the U.S. configurator at $29,815. The Ioniq Hybrid and Ioniq Plug-In start at $23,000 and $26,300 for the 2020 model year, representing increases of $600 and $950.</p>
      <p>An electric motor drives the front wheels with 134 horsepower and 218 pound-feet of torque as opposed to 118 horsepower for the previous incarnation of the Ioniq Electric. The on-board charger is also better, now capable of 7.2 <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/k.html#ge-kilowatt"><u>kW</u></a> and fast-charging capability. A 100-kW station is capable of filling up the battery to 80 percent in 54 minutes.</p>
      <p>In the case of the hybrid and plug-in hybrid, Hyundai retained the 1.6-liter engine and battery packs (1.56 and 8.9 kWh, respectively). The total system output is 139 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque for the hybrid while the plug-in hybrid levels up to 156 horsepower. Those who don’t need the all-electric range of the Ioniq Electric for their daily commute to work and back home should consider the plug in (29 miles). The Ioniq Plug-In should also appeal to those with range anxiety thanks to its Atkinson-cycle engine.</p>
      <p>Changes are even more noticeable outside, but the interior of the 2020 Ioniq stands out for us. The upper and lower sections of the instrument panel have been redesigned, 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment is standard across the range, and SmartSense technologies bundle driving assistants such as forward collision avoidance, automatic high beams, and driver attention warning. 🏁</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>20 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>yundai today introduced its redesigned eco-friendly IONIQ car lineup in a North American debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. IONIQ Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid and Electric cars all receive refreshed exterior and interior designs, added infotainment</p>
        <p>technology and new Hyundai SmartSense™ active safety features and driving assistance systems. Drivers of the new 2020 IONIQ Electric can also enjoy 170 miles of range thanks to an upgraded 38.3-kWh battery with 36% more energy capacity. All 2020 IONIQ models also receive revised feature packaging because of all the product enhancements. IONIQ Hybrid with an EPA estimated 58 combined MPG remains the fuel economy leader for a non-plug-in vehicle. The new IONIQ Hybrid, Plug-in and Electric are available to customers now.</p>
        <p>Overview</p>
        <p>Since its launch in 2016, IONIQ has been the world’s first car planned from the start to offer three electrified powertrains – hybrid, plug-in hybrid and full electric. It was also Hyundai’s first alternative fuel vehicle engineered to provide outstanding efficiency while being fun-to-drive. For the 2020 model year, IONIQ has a new futuristic aerodynamic exterior and interior design. While new segment first features like Highway Driving Assist (optional) and Lane Following Assist (optional) make long trips less stressful and more comfortable.</p>
        <p>When it comes to safety, all redesigned IONIQ models are equipped with a comprehensive Hyundai SmartSense technology package. This cutting-edge driver assistance system constantly monitors the environment around the car alerting drivers to potential hazards while on the road. This system includes standard Forward Collision Avoidance Assist, High Beam Assist and a Drivers Attention Warning.</p>
        <p>Finally, Hyundai’s industry-exclusive Lifetime Hybrid/Electric Battery Warranty continues to give piece of mind for owners. The coverage expands the benefits of the Hyundai Assurance comprehensive warranty program, including a 10-year powertrain warranty. The Hyundai Lifetime Hybrid/Electric Battery Warranty ensures that if IONIQ’s Hybrid/Electric lithium-ion-polymer battery ever needs replacement, Hyundai will replace the battery and cover recycling costs for the old battery pack free-of-charge to the original owner.</p>

        <p>Powertrains</p>
        <p>The new IONIQ Electric’s battery has been upgraded from 28 kWh to 38.3 kWh, meaning drivers can go even further between charges. It boasts 36% additional energy storage capacity, offering a total of 170 miles of estimated range. Its e-motor delivers 134 horsepower and 218 lb.-ft. of torque and is fitted standard with a 7.2-kW on-board charger - an upgrade from current 6.6-kW – for Type 2 AC charging. Using a 100-kW fast-charging station, the battery can reach 80% charge in as little as 54 minutes.</p>
        <p>The new IONIQ Hybrid and IONIQ Plug-in both feature the known 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine delivering 104 horsepower and 109 lb.-ft. of torque. IONIQ Hybrid’s permanent magnet electric motor delivers 32 kW with maximum torque of 125 lb.-ft., powered by a lithium-ion-polymer battery with 1.56 kWh of capacity positioned under the rear seats. The plug-in version’s electric motor delivers 45 kW (60 horsepower) with maximum torque of 125 lb.-ft., powered by an 8.9 kWh lithium-ion-polymer battery. The 1.6-liter GDI engine combined with the electric motor in IONIQ</p>
        <p>Hybrid delivers a total system output of 139 horsepower and up to 195 lb.-ft. of torque. The IONIQ Plug-in Hybrid model delivers a total system output of 156 horsepower and 195 lb.-ft. of torque.</p>
        <p>IONIQ Hybrid Blue model still has an EPA-estimated 58 MPG combined rating, the highest rating of any non-plug-in vehicle sold in the U.S. market. Drivers choosing IONIQ Plug-in can safely rely on 29 miles of pure electric driving range powered by the 8.9 kWh battery pack.</p>
        <p>Blue Link</p>
        <p>The upgraded IONIQ line still feature Hyundai’s Blue Link connected car system, which uses embedded telematics to allow drivers to remote start their vehicle and control air conditioning using the MyHyundai smartphone app. The app also allows users to remote lock or unlock their doors, and find their vehicle in a crowded parking lot with Car Finder and remote horn and lights. This technology also allows owners of the plug-in or electric model to remotely check the status of their battery so they know when they need to recharge the vehicle. Thanks to Blue Link, charging can be remotely controlled and scheduled via the app.</p>
        <p>In addition, Blue Link in the new IONIQ arrives with cloud-based navigation, which offers free up-to-the-minute traffic information, POI searches, dealer locator as well as the ability to locate nearby charging stations.</p>
        <p>Audio Video Navigation system</p>
        <p>The optional Audio Video Navigation system displays a wide variety of useful information across its 10.25-inch split touch-screen. The improved screen can be customized providing two home screen versions and the ability to edit displayed widgets and icons. In addition to standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay with the base onboard system, with standard new Multi-Bluetooth function (with 10.25-inch AVN option only) drivers of the new IONIQ can connect two phones at the same time to allow users to listen to each phone’s music through Bluetooth streaming.</p>
        <p>Interior Design</p>
        <p>As well as the new convenience features, the 2020 IONIQ lineup’s reimagined interior incorporates new design touches to enhance its sophisticated image. Below the optional new widescreen 10.25-inch AVN system, the redesigned control panel for heating and climate control sports a sleek, glossy finish. New touch-type control buttons allow for intuitive operation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning. IONIQ Electric’s standard high-resolution 7-inch LCD console display (optional for hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions) improves with mood lighting to visualize the different drive mode themes. To round off the modern interior design, blue ambient lighting has been applied across the passenger-side lower dashboard and the center console.</p>
        <p>Eco-Conscious Interior and Exterior Materials</p>
        <p>A key characteristic of the IONIQ line is its innovative use of recycled or ecologically-sensitive materials. The interior door covers are made of plastic combined with powdered wood and volcanic stone while providing the same quality appearance of typical materials. The softer, more natural feel is achieved along with less reliance on oil-based products. Raw materials extracted from sugar cane are partly applied on the headliner and cargo area. Paint with renewable ingredients extracted from soybean oil is used to achieve lustrous metallic colors on key components.</p>
        <p>• Bio Thermal Plastic Olefin (TPO) is used on interior soft-touch surfaces o Sugar cane accounts for 25% of the raw materials</p>
        <p>• Natural Plastic o Recycled plastic combined with powdered wood and volcanic stone reduces weight by 20%</p>
        <p>• Bio Metallic Paint o Eco-friendly paint with ingredients extracted from soybean oil used to achieve polished metallic colors</p>
        <p>• Bio Fabric o Sugar cane accounts for 20% of the raw materials</p>
        <p>Exterior Design</p>
        <p>Up front, the hybrid and plug-in versions of the new IONIQ now show a redesigned mesh-type radiator grille. The front of the new IONIQ Electric has a new distinctive pattern on the closed grille. All models feature an updated front bumper design with a silver molding at the bottom. New anthracite gray trim seen on the rear bumper molding and daytime running light bezels up front create a more refined and dynamic look. The LED DRLs, as well as the newly available LED head- and taillights, make IONIQ stand out at night – offering not only aesthetic enhancements but also additional safety.</p>
        <p>IONIQ Plug-in and Electric are available with redesigned 16-inch (standard) alloy wheels, while customers of IONIQ Hybrid can choose between a new 15 and 17-inch (optional) wheel designs.</p>
        <p>SmartSense Safety and Convenience</p>
        <p>The new IONIQ’s leading safety package includes Front Collision Warning and Avoidance Assist with Pedestrian Detection with new Cyclist Detection ability and Driver Attention Warning as standard. Lane Keeping Assist and High Beam Assist also come standard. Available options also include Lane Following Assist, which helps keep the car in the middle of a lane so drivers can navigate safely, including in heavy traffic during rush hour.</p>
        <p>Using the radar sensor to detect the distance from the car in front, Smart Cruise Control with Stop &amp; Go maintains a preset distance to automatically stop and depart again according to traffic conditions. Additional options include Blind-Spot Collision Warning and Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Warning (Optional on Hybrid and Standard on Plug-in and Electric).</p>
        <p>The new IONIQ Plug-in and Hybrid are equipped with the Eco-Driving Assist System (Eco-DAS) to help improve fuel economy. The integrated Coasting Guide analyzes road information from the Navigation system to notify the driver when deceleration (for example change of directions, cross-roads, highway exits) may be imminent. The feature aims to reduce fuel consumption and minimize brake usage. The Coasting Guide can be activated when in Eco mode between 25 and 100 mph.</p>
        <p>Eco DAS is further equipped with a Predictive Energy Management system, which manages charging and discharging of the battery in uphill and downhill situations to maximize battery usage. When a lack of battery state-of-charge is predicted driving uphill, IONIQ Plug-in and Hybrid increase internal-combustion engine operation to charge the battery. When a sufficient battery state-of-charge is reached during downhill driving, e-motor intervention increases to minimize fuel consumption and further energy is simultaneously recovered through regenerative braking.</p>
        <p>Driving Dynamics</p>
        <p>Thanks to IONIQ’s renowned dynamics and performance, drivers of the new IONIQ Hybrid and Plug-in versions can enjoy the fun-to-drive aspect of a well-built electrified car with the responsive shifts from a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. IONIQ customers also benefit from a low center of gravity due to the low placement of the battery pack, increasing the fun while driving.</p>
        <p>The hybrid and plug-in versions of the new IONIQ feature Adjustable Regenerative Braking in Eco mode, which allows drivers to select from different intensity levels via the paddle shifters. In Sport mode, the paddles act as manual shifters.</p>
        <p>Taking a cue from its similarly innovative Kona Electric sibling, the new IONIQ Electric adopts 1-pedal driving capability, which allows drivers to stop the car by simply holding onto the left paddle shift lever with often no need to engage the braking pedal. This maximizes the use of regenerative braking technology. Using Smart Regenerative Braking, the level of energy recuperation is automatically adjusted depending on the road incline and traffic situation in front when coasting.</p>
        <p>The new IONIQ Electric also features Eco+, which supplements the standard Eco, Comfort and Sport driving modes. By selecting the Eco+ mode, drivers can reduce their energy consumption and the car’s remaining energy can be extended during unforeseeable emergency situations.</p>
