        <b>UK offers South Africans free visa assessment and work opportunities</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Africans are rejoicing after Move Up has announced that they are offering free visa assessments to all South Africans. The program,  which was announced earlier today was met with rejoicing from South Africans who qualify for the different criteria.</p>
      <p>South Africans have been advised to take advantage of the program. Here are the most accessible UK visas for South Africans looking to relocate to the UK.</p>
      <p>1. Birth Rights</p>
      <p>If your parents or grandparents hail from England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and you have access to their birth certificates, you could be eligible for a British passport or an ancestral visa.</p>
      <p>2.  Points-Based System</p>
      <p>If birth and marriage rights do not apply to you, the next best way to qualify to live and work in the UK is to qualify for their points-based visa system. The points-based system makes provision for business owners, investors and individuals with specific skills.</p>
      <p>3.  Spouse Visa</p>
      <p>If your partner has a British passport or is eligible to apply for an ancestral visa, you can relocate to the UK after obtaining a spousal visa.  Spousal visas take usually three months to process, but it is possible to pay an additional fee to speed things up.</p>
      <p>4. Non Points Based Visa</p>
      <p>For those who don’t qualify for any of the above visas, there is a collection of unique UK visas that cater for truly exceptional human beings.  This category applies to highly talented sportsmen and women, as well as academics who hold a PhD in science, engineering, the humanities, medicine, digital technology or the arts; and those who are considered (established or emerging) leaders in their field</p>
