      <h1>'Battle fatigue': Star joins fight against changes to Queen Vic Market</h1>

      <p>Australian actor Sigrid Thornton and her film producer husband Tom Burstall have lashed Melbourne City Council over the redevelopment of Queen Victoria Market, with Mr Burstall accusing it of “stealing a community asset”.</p>
      <p>Mr Burstall told a Friends of Queen Victoria Market forum that fruit and vegetable traders were being driven out of business so they could be replaced with stalls selling wine and takeaway food.</p>

      <p>“Their main game is they are trying to change the use of the market, they are trying to get rid of the general merchandise market and fresh produce market,” Mr Burstall told the forum of about 150 people.</p>
      <p>“The City of Melbourne are stealing a community asset and they are changing its use … They are going to turn this into a dining events area, it’s going to be like Darling Harbour in Sydney.”</p>
      <p>The council is seeking to revitalise the market by changing its opening hours for the first time in almost 20 years, championing the night market, transforming String Bean Alley into a hipster hub and introducing fixed storage, refrigeration for fresh produce traders and loading docks.</p>
      <p>The market’s chief executive, Stan Liacos, told <i>The Age</i> in August that “no change at QVM is not an option”.</p>

      <p>In April, the council endorsed a controversial proposal to replace the open-air car park at Queen Victoria Market with a new public square.</p>
      <p>It says an extra 1000 car parking spots will be created to offset those lost with 500 at the Munro site on Therry Street and 500 within a future development site on Franklin Street.</p>

      <p>But Mr Burstall, who was a member of the people’s panel appointed to give the community a greater voice in the redevelopment, said the consultation had been a “sham”.</p>
      <p>He said the changes to the opening hours made no sense and the council had ignored the people panel’s recommendation to keep the open-air car park.</p>
      <p>“Why did they have the bloody consultation in the first place, it was bullshit,” he said.</p>
      <p>The council bought the Munro site opposite the market in 2014 for $76 million, with real estate agents at the time questioning whether it had paid too much.</p>
      <p>In February, the council said the development on the site, which will include a boutique hotel, retail and apartments, would “secure the market’s future as an affordable, authentic open-air market, known for fresh produce (and) specialty shopping”.</p>
      <p>Thornton, who stars in <i>SeaChange</i>, said she had been part of the fight for a long time.</p>
      <p>“It’s so amazing to see so many people here because battle fatigue is no doubt what Melbourne City Council has in mind,” she said.</p>
      <p>Reason Party MP Fiona Patten told the forum “gerrymandering” – a practice intended to establish a political advantage for a particular group – was at play because corporations were entitled to two votes in Melbourne City Council elections while residents get only one.</p>
      <p>“As a friend of these markets I think the response of council would be different if it was answerable to people not businesses,” she said.</p>
      <p>General merchandise trader Jenny Pyke said the past five years had been the most difficult the market had ever been through.</p>
      <p>She said if the open-air car park was turned into a public square a large proportion of traders’ vans would not be able to be accommodated.</p>
      <p>“The market is in decline from Peel Street down. Losing the car park would be another nail in the coffin,” she said.</p>
      <p>“If this continues as planned we will end up with a little market next to an event space. We would lose our title as the largest open-air market in the southern hempisphere, which we have proudly carried all this time.”</p>
