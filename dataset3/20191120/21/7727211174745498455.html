      <h2>Liverpool's Gini Wijnaldum sent out a powerful anti-racism message as he scored a hat-trick for Holland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:35:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author">Caoimhe O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>Holland's hat-trick hero Gini Wijnaldum teamed up with Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong to send out a powerful anti-racism message on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpools-gini-wijnaldum-nets-first-17284393">Netherlands stormed to victory</a> with a 5-0 rout of Estonia in their final Euro 2020 qualifier, having already booked their place in next summer's finals with a draw against Northern Ireland on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum put his side into an early lead after six minutes with a looping header, and the 29-year-old immediately ran to the touchline to celebrate with his team-mates.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool midfielder, who added two second half goals to take home the match ball, teamed up with De Jong to send a moving message.</p>
      <p>Former Ajax star, De Jong, pulled up his sleeve to reveal his forearm as Wijnaldum pointed to his own skin and then tapped the Barca man's arm.</p>

      <p>This gesture follows Wijnaldum's response to the racial abuse suffered by a Dutch second division player at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Excelsior striker Ahmad Mendes Moreira was allegedly subjected to racist chanting during his side's game against FC Den Bosch on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The referee was forced to stop play for more than 30 minutes after Moreira and his teammates left the field.</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpools-gini-wijnaldum-makes-powerful-17280090">expressed his shock and anger</a> at the incident in his country, describing it as "despicable".</p>
      <p>"It really hit me on a personal level," he <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/18/football/1574094313_822934.html">told reporters</a> ahead of the meeting with Estonia.</p>
      <p>"I never expected anything like this to happen in the Netherlands. I'm really shocked. It did happen, unfortunately, and the way people have talked about the incident really hurt me.</p>
      <p>"It's a problem in society. As a player, you can't really change anything about it. But I still think that players should try and support each other. It's a problem in society and a problem that should be solved by our politicians.</p>

      <p>"I hope that there will be severe punishments. This really can't happen again. It's not just the racism to the player from Excelsior, but I also saw someone doing the Nazi salute in the stands. When I saw that, I thought, 'What is wrong with you if you do something like that?'</p>
      <p>"Our ancestors fought for us so we can live freely. If people still perform the Nazi salute, that's utterly disrespectful. That just can't happen. We can't allow that in the Netherlands. That's what I think. There have to be severe punishments."</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum added: "We want to play football to enjoy ourselves, we want to entertain our supporters. We don't want to see things like this happening."</p>
      <p>When asked if he would leave the field if he was targeted with similar abuse, the Dutch international said: "I walk off the pitch. I'm going for sure. I'll never accept that.</p>
      <p>"You shouldn't come back on the pitch. What is the point in coming back? What has changed? Everything just stays the same.</p>
      <p>"We talked about it with our guys. Look at our squad. We are one. We don't look at skin colour. We play for the Dutch team, we play for this shirt, we play for the people.</p>
      <p>"We play so we can entertain the people; we play so we can be at a big tournament such as the Euros again.</p>
      <p>"We are so happy about qualifying and then this happens a day later. It's so surreal because those people that did this will be cheering for us if we perform well at the Euros."</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, Netherlands boss <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ronald-koeman">Ronald Koeman</a> said: "Gini just said something about it [the celebration] in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>"He said he feels so happy with this Dutch team, where this problem [of racism] does not occur. It is one team and it’s nice to see."</p>
