      <h1>Apple releases Smart Battery Case for iPhone 11 and 11 Pro</h1>
      <h2>The official iPhone accessory gets its iPhone 11 update right on time</h2>

      <p>Apple has launched Smart Battery Cases for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MWVH2ZM/A/iphone-11-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MWVM2ZM/A/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-white">11 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MWVP2ZM/A/iphone-11-pro-max-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">11 Pro Max</a> in what is now an expected annual move. The cases are on sale from Apple for £129/$129.</p>
      <p>Apple first introduced its Smart Battery Case accessory for the iPhone 6 and 6s as a rubberised clip on that boosted your battery life to an acceptable level. Released again for the iPhone 7, the cases made sure your iPhone got through the day on a single charge – something that the thin phones couldn’t do themselves sometimes.</p>
      <p>But the iPhone 11 series has been praised for its outstanding battery life – all three phones can get through a day of heavy use no problem, so the battery cases this year might not be the essential purchase for some that they once were.</p>
      <p>The new cases are notable for the new addition of a dedicated camera button, something that no case (and indeed no iPhone) before has had. A press of it launches the Camera app if your phone is locked or unlocked. A press then takes a photo, while a long press captures a QuickTake video.</p>
      <p>If you’re travelling across continents or have a busy schedule with no time for a charge though, these are the best bet for ensuring you’re not going to come over all battery anxious. Apple says each case delivers 50% extra battery life. They are all Qi charging compatible and have Lightning ports, so when charging both the phone and case get juice.</p>
