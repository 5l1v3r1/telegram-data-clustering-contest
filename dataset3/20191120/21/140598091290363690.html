      <h1>Andy Murray conjures up another miracle comeback to give Great Britain winning start in Davis Cup opener</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:18:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/simon-briggs/" target="_blank">Simon Briggs</a></address>
      <p>Great Britain’s debut at the new-look Davis Cup finals delivered a bizarre mixture of riveting tennis, technical cock-ups and scheduling nightmares.</p>
      <p>In other words, it summed up this rickety yet strangely fascinating event. Each of the three rubbers was finely balanced, starting with Andy Murray’s laboured victory over the exotically named Dutch No 2 Tallon Griekspoor, in which Murray was twice only two points from defeat.​</p>
      <p>This made for captivating drama, ending after almost nine hours in a 2-1 win for Great Britain. But it also meant that the fans waiting for the next match on Stadium 3 – Australia v Belgium – were forced to cool their heels in frosty temperatures for almost two-and-a-half hours after their scheduled start time of 6pm.</p>
      <p>Great Britain lost the second rubber when Dan Evans allowed a 6-3, 5-3 lead to slip away against Robin Haase – a former top-40 player who can be almost irresistible when he catches a wave of inspiration. But with everything riding on the concluding doubles match, Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski held their nerve magnificently to beat Jean-Julien Rojer and Wesley Koolhof by a 6-4, 7-6 scoreline. For Skupski – whose name appeared as “Skupsky” on the local TV graphics – this was a spectacular debut. His colleagues had cruelly filmed his nervous speech at the team’s pre-tournament dinner – a long-standing tradition for newcomers – and posted it on social media. But when the time came for his racket to do the talking, his right arm was loose and deadly.​</p>
      <p>“It’s been one of the longest days I have had sitting in the chair,” said the team captain Leon Smith, who would have faced harsh questioning had Great Britain lost to Holland for the first time in their Davis Cup history.​</p>
      <p>“What Andy did was astonishing,” Smith added, “especially when he was not feeling great. And then Jamie and Neal played unbelievable stuff. For Neal to play his first tie, he shone today.”​</p>
      <p>Selection was not easy for Smith. Andy Murray has always been Britain’s trump card, but he had not played competitive tennis for a month. In that time, he has welcomed a new son – Teddy – while also gaining 4.5kg through a junk-heavy diet featuring plenty of chocolate biscuits and cake.​</p>
      <p>So while everyone had assumed that Murray would squash Griekspoor – the world No 179, who has never played a main-draw match at a grand slam – this match turned into a real epic. As they shook hands at the net after Murray’s 6-7, 6-4, 7-6 victory, the former Wimbledon champion told his unfancied opponent that he had deserved the win more. Asked about his sluggish start to the event, Murray replied “If you’re weighing four or five kilos more than you’re used to, that is probably going to affect how you feel moving around the court. You go in the gym and lift a medicine ball up that’s five kilos, it’s pretty heavy. It’s never happened to me before, but I need to make sure that when I do have breaks, I’m more careful with what I’m eating. And that’s my fault, that’s not anyone else’s responsibility.”​</p>

      <p>Fortunately, from Smith’s perspective, Murray is such a scrapper that he is hard to put away even when he is short of form. Griekspoor played a cracking match, banging down 24 aces in these superfast conditions. Yet he still came up just short.​</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of myself,” said Murray, “because it would have been easy to have lost that.” But there must now be serious doubt – after this 2hr 55 min epic – that he will play in Thursday’s second and final round-robin match against Kazakhstan. After its first three days, this self-styled “World Cup of Tennis” has thrown up a kaleidoscope of multiple storylines, some thrilling and others embarrassing.​</p>
      <p>One of the biggest hitches has been the erratic tournament iPhone app, which often supplies inaccurate scores. Gerard Pique – the Barcelona footballer who is the face of the event – was personally instructing people on Wednesday to delete the app and reinstall it, as if he were an IT consultant as well as a world-class centre back.​</p>
      <p>Similar gremlins affected the LED screens on Stadium 3 on Wednesday as Murray and Skupski were trying to wrap up the match. “It was definitely annoying,” said Jamie Murray of the bright flashes of static that appeared at random moments. “It happened three times. The third time I hit an ace and then it was a let.”​</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the complexities of the group format have already thrown up their first controversy. Having won both singles matches against the United States on Tuesday night – and thus become the first team to claim a place in tomorrow’s quarter-finals – the Canadians defaulted the doubles on the grounds that they did not have two players fit enough to compete. The US were credited with a 6-0, 6-0 automatic victory, which could end up sending them through when the final mathematical computations come into play.​</p>
      <p>“That could have implications to all of the teams potentially that might finish in second place,” said Murray on Wednesday. “I believe they also would have had two days off after that so I think they [the Canadians] should have played the tie.”</p>
