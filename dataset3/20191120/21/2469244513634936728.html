      <p>Christmas is fast approaching, and we could all do with a little extra cash.</p>
      <p>Bonuses are a popular way to spread the festive cheer, and those that claim benefits may be entitled to a little extra cash.</p>
      <p>At £10, it won't be enough for a meal out or a big treat, but it can be a helpful boost on what can be a difficult time of the year money-wise.</p>
      <p>The bonus is usually paid in the first week of December, and is given to households claiming specific benefits. <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-christmas-bonus-date-17277129?_ga=2.177076140.841394072.1574267021-1735012691.1561448173">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>

      <p>Couples who are married, in a civil partnership or are living together will both receive the bonus if they both fall under one of the categories outlined above.</p>

      <p>If you do receive it, the Christmas Bonus may show up with a transaction ID of  <b>'DWP XB'</b>  in your bank account.</p>
