      <h2>Dame Joan Collins hates jeans - especially the ones with holes in - and says they're 'unflattering'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:16:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ashleigh Rainbird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ashleigh-rainbird/</a></address>
      <p>They’re a wardrobe staple with cuts to suit every body shape - so it’s almost universally accepted that you can’t go wrong with a classic pair of denim jeans.</p>
      <p>Almost [ITALICS] universally.</p>
      <p>Dame Joan Collins thinks jeans are “tragic”.</p>
      <p>“I hate jeans,” she scoffs. “I hate them, they’re so unflattering.</p>
      <p>“And I hate jeans with holes in the knees, or holes anywhere.”</p>
      <p>Raging that “everyone” in LA wears jeans and t-shirts, she adds: “I don’t like that look. I like to be comfortable, but I want to be elegant, too.”</p>

      <p>Dame Joan, who actually had her own denim line in the 1980s, has previously declared that jeans make “fat people look fatter” and remarked that “tiny people with thin legs tend to look like giant spiders”.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Vogue as she launched her Christmas campaign for Valentino (who she notes also hates denim), a diamond-clad Dame Joan laments a bygone era where dressing up was more the norm.</p>

      <p>“Nobody dresses up anymore,” she complains. “If you do, then people stare at you, or make cutting remarks: ‘Oh, look at you! You’re all dressed up.’</p>
      <p>“I find that very sad, because it will be the end of women buying elegant clothes in stores.”</p>
      <p>Assume there’s a dress code if you’re popping to Dame Joan’s for a festive tipple.</p>
