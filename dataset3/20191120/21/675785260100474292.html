      <h1>Manchester Arena blast victim's vow to Chris Hemsworth as he battles to walk again</h1>
      <h2>Martin Hibbert, 43, was told he'd be in a wheelchair for life - but a miracle treatment means he has regained movement in his legs and he's now been invited to the 2021 Thor premiere</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:18:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Fiona Duffy</a></address>
      <p>Leaning down towards his wife, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-arena-explosion">Manchester Arena</a> bomb hero Martin Hibbert plants a miracle kiss he thought would never be possible.</p>
      <p>Just two years ago, strapping 6ft Martin was told he would never walk again after shrapnel from the terrorist blast severed his spine.</p>
      <p>Martin was the closest casualty to the blast to survive. Doctors compared his horrific injuries to being shot at point blank range 22 times.</p>
      <p>Today, following revolutionary brain-training treatment, the 43-year-old has defied medics and is standing up to plant a smacker on wife Gabby.</p>
      <p>“Being able to hold her in my arms and lean down to kiss her is an amazing feeling,” he said. “I’m over the moon.”</p>

      <p>Martin, from Chorley, Lancs, was paralysed from the belly button down and was told he would be in a  wheelchair for life after the terrorist atrocity in May 2017, which left 22 dead.</p>
      <p>However, last March the Mirror revealed dad-of-one Martin had regained movement in his legs following the radical treatment at the NeuroPhysics Therapy Clinic in Queensland, Australia.</p>
      <p>And after a second course of treatment over four months this summer, the football agent can stand independently in his callipers – stretching up to his full height for the first time in more than two years.</p>
      <p>Astonishingly, Martin’s next goal is to walk the red carpet with Avengers star Chris Hemsworth, who befriended him during his stay Down Under.</p>

      <p>Hemsworth is in talks to star in a forthcoming movie about Australian Paralympian John Maclean, who underwent the same revolutionary NPT treatment. After 25 years in a wheelchair, he is now walking and has even completed a triathlon.</p>
      <p>Martin, who is married to NHS human resources adviser, Gabby, 47, said: “I am a huge Avengers fan so to learn that Chris Hemsworth wanted to meet me while I was over there was incredible.</p>
      <p>"When I was invited to his home in Byron Bay I thought ‘are you having a laugh?’ I was so nervous on the way there but he welcomed me with a big hug.</p>
      <p>“He was asking me all about what happened and was really interested in Ken and his work. I showed him videos of my progress and he said: ‘Oh my God – I feel humbled sat here talking to you.’ It should have been me saying that to him! It was amazing. We chatted for more than two hours.</p>

      <p>“When he invited me to the London premiere of the new Thor movie in 2021 I said I’d be walking by then and he said ‘Great. We’ll get you down and do the red carpet together’. That’s my goal now.”</p>
      <p>Martin had an emotional reunion with his family, including his daughter Eve, 17, who was also injured in the blast, after spending four months away in Australia.</p>
      <p>“Gabby was with me for the first two weeks but then I was on my own,” he said. “Doing everything for myself has been a real confidence booster. I’ve learned I can do this.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been sending videos and updates but to see me in the flesh, standing unaided, has been really emotional for everybody. Nobody can understand how I’m doing it!</p>

      <p>“And I keep saying ‘watch this space’. Because there is more to come! My physique has changed completely. I am fitter than I’ve ever been in my life.”</p>
      <p>NeuroPhysics Therapy is a series of programmed exercises that change the way the brain sends messages to the body.</p>
      <p>In patients with spinal cord injury, neurons, or nerve cells, are encouraged to bypass the injured area and send messages to the limbs.</p>
      <p>Dad-of-two Steve Cook, 56, left paralysed after a cycling accident, was the first UK patient treated at the clinic in 2016.</p>
      <p>Steve, of Cleethorpes, Lincs, is now walking and even cycling again – completing a 100-mile ride this summer.</p>
      <p>Martin said: “It’s great to hear these success stories and know that we’re not only inspiring but giving hope to others.</p>
      <p>“Every day at the clinic, Ken was introducing me to new patients from all over the world. They were saying ‘we’re here because of you’.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That was a very humbling experience. Ken wants to meet my consultants to show how far we’ve come and that this treatment really works.</p>
      <p>“When you leave a spinal unit you’re given nothing to hope for. Even if, in future, patients are told ‘there are treatments out there’ rather than ‘you’ll never walk again.</p>
      <p>Sorry but that’s it,’ it would be a start. At least they’d have something to aim for.”</p>
      <p>And he vowed: “I’m going to be standing up as much as I can now to get strength back in my legs ready to start walking.</p>
      <p>"I want to do all the things I used to take for granted, like cooking a meal or standing up in the shower.”</p>
      <p>Martin also hopes his story will encourage others who suffer a spinal cord injury.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just about standing again,” he said. “It’s about inspiring others to get up, get out and start living again. I lived in Australia independently for four months and travelled home alone.</p>
      <p>"I’m driving an adapted car now. Yes, life is tougher, and you may have to do things a different way – but you can still do them. It’s all up here,” he said, tapping to his head.</p>

      <p>“If you can get it right up here, and have the right support, anything is possible.”</p>
      <p>NPT founder Ken Ware said: “Martin has worked hard and made huge progress. He’s holding himself up nice and strong now when he stands. And his leg movement, and the control he has now, is phenomenal.</p>
      <p>“It was great to have him here and very emotional saying goodbye to him. So many new patients are out here now after reading about Martin and it was great for them to meet him. He’s done so much to help get NPT out there in the wider world.</p>
      <p>“His story will continue to give hope to so many others.”</p>
