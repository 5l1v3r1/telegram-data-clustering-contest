      <h1>The A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby Trailer Is As Bonkers As You'd Expect</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:18:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Ariana Yaptangco</a></address>
      <p>Back in <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a26783549/a-christmas-prince-3-announced-netflix/">March</a>, Netflix announced the third installment of its cult holiday franchise <i>A Christmas Prince, </i>A.K.A. the gift that keeps on giving. Now, fans of Queen Amber and King Richard have a trailer for <i>A Christmas Prince: The Royal Bab</i>y and boy, is it a lot.</p>
      <p>The movie takes place a year after <i>A Christmas Prince: the Royal Wedding</i> and follows Amber and Richard as they prepare for the birth of their first child. Amber—with a new, duchess-like makeover—has settled into her role as Queen of Aldovia, and all seems to be going well until royals from a distant kingdom come to town.</p>
      <p>I have so many thoughts about the mere two minutes we are given of a <i>Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby,</i> which manages to cram a pregnancy, a sacred treaty, a mysterious whodunit robbery, an ancient curse, a lavish Christmas party, a baby shower, and a Cinderella Easter egg into a Grade-A bonkers trailer.</p>
      <p>About that ancient curse: King Tai and Queen Ming of Penglia are visiting Aldovia to renew a sacred 600-year-old truce between the two nations. Chaos ensues after the treaty goes missing, and as Princess Emily helpfully points out (citing some sort of old Aldovian history book—or is it a spell book? Check your sources!), Amber's baby will be cursed if the treaty isn't signed by midnight on Christmas Eve. Drama!</p>
      <p>Will our Converse-wearing, subway-riding heroine be able to save her child from the clutches of an ancient curse? Who stole the treaty? DO Amber and Richard have any names to share??? So many questions, answered December 5.</p>
