      <p>In September, Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-announces-impeachment-inquiry-into-donald-trump/">announced</a> that the House of Representatives would be pursuing a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.</p>
      <p>The decision came in light of a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-conversation-with-ukraine-leader-11568993176">whistleblower complaint</a> that the president sought to use foreign power for his own political gain during a phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, by asking that Ukraine investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. The president later confirmed that his administration <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-acknowledges-withholding-funds-ukraine-n1058126">withheld nearly $400 million in aid</a> to Ukraine but denied that it was done for leverage.</p>

      <p>Last month, the House of Representatives approved a resolution that <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/impeachment-update-house-approves-resolution-to-formalize-inquiry/">formalized the inquiry</a> and outlined the public-facing portion of the impeachment inquiry, which includes Wednesday’s hearing.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday was the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/impeachment-hearing-ratings-abc-wins-in-key-demo-msnbc-is-last/">first day</a> of televised hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Though Fox News was the early ratings winner among cable news channels, ABC actually topped the key adults 25-54 demographic when looking across all of TV.</p>
      <p>Fox News beat the other broadcast and cable news networks in viewership during both days of the impeachment inquiry hearing coverage last week to deliver its highest-rated week of the year in total day viewership.</p>
      <p>The week of Nov. 11 brought in Fox News’ highest viewership since the 2018 midterm election, according to Nielsen ratings.</p>
