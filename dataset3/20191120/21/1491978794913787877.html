        <i>PM tasked Chrystia Freeland with preventing provincial feud from becoming national crisis as minister of intergovernmental affairs</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> has unveiled a new cabinet which will prioritize warding off threats to national unity and combatting climate change, as he attempts to navigate the politically-fraught landscape of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/canada-elections-justin-trudeau-wins-narrow-victory-to-form-minority-government">minority government</a>.</p>
      <p>As Canada’s western provinces <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/alberta-canada-election-justin-trudeau-oil">take an increasingly combative stance against the prime minister’s environmental policies</a> and demand support for the struggling oil and gas industry, Trudeau has tasked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/10/canada-chrystia-freeland-foreign-minister-russia-critic">Chrystia Freeland</a> with preventing a provincial feud from becoming a national crisis.</p>
      <p>Previously the foreign affairs minister, Freeland will now serve as minister of intergovernmental affairs as well as deputy prime minister, a largely symbolic role.</p>
      <p>Freeland rose to prominence leading Canada’s team at lengthy trade talks with the US and Mexico, and her skills as a negotiator will probably be a key asset as she manages the relationship between the federalgovernment, provinces and territories.</p>
      <p>Freeland will also continue overseeing the relationship between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> and the US.</p>
      <p>Trudeau also named former trade minister Jim Carr, who is suffering from cancer, to act as his special representative for Alberta, Saskatchewan and the central province of Manitoba to ensure they had “a strong voice in Ottawa”.</p>
      <p>François-Philippe Champagne, an international lawyer from Quebec, will replace Freeland as minister of foreign affairs. Champagne’s promotion – and the appointment of Montreal’s Pablo Rodríguez as house leader, reflects the growing political heft of Bloc Québécois, a sovereigntist party whose support – and 32 parliamentary votes – will be critical for Trudeau’s ability to govern.</p>
      <p>After campaigning on a pledge to fight climate change, Trudeau moved Catherine McKenna from the environment ministry to minister of infrastructure, where she will focus on the development of low carbon projects such as public transit. Jonathan Wilkinson, the former fisheries minister, will oversee the environment portfolio.</p>
      <p>Both Wilkinson and Freeland also represent an attempt by Trudeau to address the lack of representation in western provinces after his Liberal party lost all its seats in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Despite representing Toronto, Freeland was born and raised in Peace River, Alberta. While Wilkinson represents Vancouver, he grew up in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Canada’s parliament will reconvene foe the first time since the general election on 5 December.</p>
