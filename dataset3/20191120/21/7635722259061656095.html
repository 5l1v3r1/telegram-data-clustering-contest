      </h3>
      <p>Well-known Dublin criminal Martin 'The Viper' Foley has been ordered to pay over €738,000 in unpaid tax and interest payments.</p>
      <p>It comes after the 66-year-old failed to convince the Court of Appeal that the proceedings taken by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) were unfair.</p>
      <p>Foley, a one-time associate of notorious criminal Martin Cahill, has 40 criminal convictions and has survived several attempts on his life down through the years.</p>
