        <b>PayPal has agreed its largest ever acquisition - a $4 billion deal to buy Honey Science Corporation, the firm behind a browser extension and app that helps people find online shopping rewards and deals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Founded in 2012, Honey is best known as a popular discovery tool that helps consumers find savings as they shop online. Over the years it has added other features, such as a mobile shopping assistant, an offers and rewards programme, and price-tracking tools and alerts.<br/><br/>The firm has 17 million active users and claims to have helped these people find more than $1 billion in savings over the last year.<br/><br/>PayPal says the acquisition will help it reach shoppers at the beginning of their journey, a vital advantage in the battle for e-commerce customers against a host of new rivals such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and Facebook Pay. <br/><br/>For its part, Honey will get access to PayPal and Venmo's 275 million consumer accounts, as well as 24 million merchant accounts.<br/><br/>Honey, which was profitable on a net income basis in 2018, will keep its brand and LA headquarters once the deal closes early next year.<br/><br/>Dan Schulman, CEO, PayPal, says: "Honey is amongst the most transformative acquisitions in PayPal’s history. It provides a broad portfolio of services to simplify the consumer shopping experience, while at the same time making it more affordable and rewarding.<br/><br/>"The combination of Honey’s complementary consumer products with our platform will significantly enhance our ability to drive engagement and play a more meaningful role in the daily lives of our consumers."</p>
