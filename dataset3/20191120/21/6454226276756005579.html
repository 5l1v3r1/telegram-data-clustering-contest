      <p>BNZ says Daniel Huggins, a New Zealander who is currently an executive at ASB's parent Commonwealth Bank of Australia, will join it in the New Year as executive general manager for customers, products and services.</p>
      <p>Huggins will replace Howard Silby, currently BNZ's chief operating officer, as a member of the executive team. Silby will, however, remain at BNZ as chief innovation officer.</p>
      <p>BNZ says the changes are effective from March 2020 with Huggins’ appointment subject to Reserve Bank non-objection.</p>
      <p>Huggins is currently executive general manager of home buying at CBA.</p>
