      <h1>Miguel Andujar shows off progress in Instagram videos</h1>

      <p>Exactly six months removed from surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder, Miguel Andujar is showing off his progress.</p>
      <p>Videos the Yankees third baseman posted to his Instagram story Wednesday show Andujar taking grounders at third, making throws to first and taking batting practice.</p>
      <p>Andujar, 24, played 12 games this season before undergoing season-ending surgery on May 20. He burst onto the scene during the 2018 season, finishing second in the AL Rookie of the Year voting after slashing .297/.328/.527 with 27 homers, 47 doubles and 92 RBIs.</p>
      <p>With Andujar out, Gio Urshela came out of nowhere as a fill-in to slash .314/.355/.534 with 21 homers and 74 RBIs, creating a third-base conundrum for the Yankees.</p>
      <p>General manager Brian Cashman recently said that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/yankees-brian-cashman-third-base-gio-urshelas-job-to-lose/">third base is Urshela’s “position to lose.”</a></p>
      <p>“Just like last year though, with Andujar, it was his position to lose. An injury took it away,” Cashman said. “You can’t deny how great Gio played last year. I wouldn’t be honest if I didn’t tell you going into spring training he would have the leg up.”</p>
      <p>Cashman also said recently on ESPN Radio that he’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/miguel-andujar-is-a-popular-trade-target-by-rival-gms/">gotten a lot of trade inquiries regarding Andujar</a> and that he’s wondered whether Andujar can play another position.</p>
