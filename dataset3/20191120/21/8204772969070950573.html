      <p>Strandhill in Co Sligo has been named the best place in Ireland for a health and wellbeing holiday.</p>
      <p>The coastal village, renowned for its surf and seaweed baths, was awarded the title by Eden, an EU initiative recognising “destinations of excellence” for sustainable tourism.</p>
      <p>Aoife Porter, of Strandhill Community Development Association, said the recognition followed a huge team effort involving businesses and people in the village to reduce its impact on climate change by adopting sustainable principles.</p>
      <p>“We want this generation and the next to enjoy Strandhill’s world-class surf waves, unique landscape, thriving cultural scene and significant heritage sites,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Our village is for everyone – for locals and tourists alike. It Is a village alive with a sense of community and a clear focus on health and wellbeing. This award is a testament to the fact that a community with one vision can be unstoppable.”</p>

      <p>Fáilte Ireland announced the award at a ceremony in Sligo.</p>
      <p>Eva Costello, of Fáilte Ireland, said it would “prove to be a magnet” in attracting more visitors to Sligo and to the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>
      <p>“During the on-site assessments, Strandhill Community Development Association, as well as the other shortlisted destinations, clearly demonstrated how health and wellbeing has taken a central role in their tourism offering while also sustaining their local environment,” she said.</p>
