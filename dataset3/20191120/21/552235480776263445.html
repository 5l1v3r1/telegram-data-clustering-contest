      <h1>Colin Weir completes Partick Thistle takeover as Euromillions winner sets out fan ownership plan</h1>
      <h2>The 71-year-old is planning to hand over his shares to fans after buying out the majority shareholding.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:29:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Euromillions winner Colin Weir has completed a stunning takeover of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/partick-thistle-fc">Partick Thistle</a> just months after pulling the plug on his backing for the club.</p>
      <p>The 71-year-old Jags diehard has brought months of uncertainty over the club’s future ownership to an end by purchasing a majority stake in a seven-figure move through his group Three Black Cats.</p>
      <p>As part of the deal Thistle will again take ownership of the Main Stand - ironically named the Colin Weir Stand - and the unused ground at the South Drive end of Firhill from holding company Firhill Development.</p>
      <p>And Weir will gift his 55 per cent shareholding to a Thistle supporters’ group in the next few months, making the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-championship">Championship</a> side the latest to be owned by fans.</p>

      <p>Weir has sunk £2.5million into the Firhill club since winning £161million on the lottery along with ex-wife Christine in 2011.</p>
      <p>But he withdrew his backing amid a messy boardroom shake-up in the summer which saw former chairwoman Jacqui Low ousted and replaced by former chairman David Beattie.</p>
      <p>Weir, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/largs">Largs</a> , wiped out Thistle’s debt in 2015 and funded the club’s Thistle Weir Youth Academy. He has also been involved in plans for a new training facility for which he had set aside more millions.</p>
      <p>However he pulled his support a few months ago after a boardroom coup which saw Beattie return as chairman and Low ousted along with hospitality industry consultant Michael Robertson and Duncan Smillie, the owner of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow-rocks">Glasgow Rocks</a> Basketball team who only joined the board a month earlier.</p>

      <p>Weir cited "uncertainties about its potential new ownership" at the time.</p>
      <p>Thistle were reportedly in talks with a consortium of businessmen which included Chinese-American tycoon Chien Lee who owns OGC Nice and Barnsley in the summer.</p>
      <p>But with Beattie promising to re-engage with Weir then a deal has been thrashed out which will now see the fans’ group take control in what the Jags faithful will hope heralds a bright new era for the club.</p>
      <p>Thistle currently sit bottom of the Championship table with 11 points from 13 matches and nine points off a play-off spot.</p>
      <p>Weir said: "I am grateful to the majority shareholding group and FDL for working with Three Black Cats to pave the way for the exciting prospect of fan ownership for Thistle.</p>

      <p>"I will ensure that the trust they are placing in me is not misplaced. Thistle for Ever planted the thought of fan ownership as a real option in my mind.</p>
      <p>"From there, TBC has taken the dream and is turning it in to a reality. But this has all happened quicker than anyone might have anticipated.</p>
      <p>"That’s why I have offered a three to four month window for fans to get everything in place before handing over shares.</p>
      <p>"They want to get it right and I want to be sure that when the new entity is operational, there is a structure that will allow for a smooth transfer of ownership.</p>
      <p>"This is a major financial commitment on my part as fan owners will not need to repay a penny – but I believe this gives fan ownership the best possible start.</p>

      <p>“There will be a further announcement about the members of the interim Board and, subsequent to that, in relation to my funding of the Thistle Weir Youth Academy.</p>
      <p>“Today is a great day for a club that means everything to me. I hope that fans can get behind this exciting development."</p>
      <p>Outgoing chairman Beattie said: "We are pleased that our hard work in recent months has resulted in today’s sale.</p>
      <p>"Our aim has always been to secure the long-term future of the club and we have done this by selling our shares to a man whose support and love for this club is beyond question.</p>
      <p>"Colin Weir undoubtedly has the best interests of Thistle at heart and, although there were alternatives, we believe that his plan to support fan ownership, with the right mix of experienced business people behind them offers the club a secure future.”</p>
