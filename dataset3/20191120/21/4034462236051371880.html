      <h1>2020 Mazda CX-30 Pricing Announced</h1>
      <h2>New crossover makes US debut at the 2019 LA Auto Show.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:45:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Wright</a></address>
      <p>The gap between the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-3">Mazda CX-3</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-5">CX-5</a> is a slim one, but the CX-30 is sized to slot neatly into it. Mazda says it has taken the "human-centric approach" to designing the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-30">CX-30</a>. It also uses what Mazda calls its latest evolution of Kodo design to meld the coupe and the crossover together. Making its North American debut at the 2019 LA Auto Show, we've learned that powering the CX-30 is a four-cylinder Skyactiv-G 2.5 hooked to a Skyactiv-Drive six-speed automatic transmission. Mazda claims the CX-30 now has a class-leading standard horsepower of 186 horsepower under its hood.</p>

      <p>That's the same power as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/mazda-3-sedan">Mazda3</a>, and it's not a coincidence as they both share much of the same platform. The compact crossover is equipped with Mazda's new off-road traction assist feature, and Mazda's predictive i-Activ all-wheel drive is available on all trim levels.</p>
      <p>In regards to pricing, Mazda has today announced that the base trim CX-30 with front-wheel drive starts at $21,900 while the all-wheel-drive version starts at $23,300. As we move up the trim level, the CX-30 Select comes in at $23,900, Preferred at $26,200, and Premium is priced at $28,200. All prices are before $1,045 for destination and handling, and $1,090 in Alaska.</p>
      <p>The price tops out with Premium and all-wheel-drive at $29,600. Three premium paint colors are also available, with Snowflake White Pearl Mica costing $200, Machine Gray Metallic at $300, and Soul Red Crystal at $595.</p>

      <p>The CX-30 comes standard with an 8.8-inch center display with Mazda Connect, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED taillights, LED daytime running lights and a matte finish front grille, push-button start, rearview camera, and remote keyless illuminated entry system. There's also a healthy suite of safety features as standard, including driver attention alert, radar cruise control with stop and go, lane departure warning with lane-keep assist, smart brake support and high beam control. Unfortunately, to get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto you need to start at the Select Trim level, as well as blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and Mazda Advanced Keyless Entry.</p>
