      <h2>As Roman and Adele struggled through their eating trial, Roman made a sly dig about Adele's photo of Jane McDonald</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/roman-kemp">Roman Kemp</a> couldn't resist making a little joke about campmate <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/adele-roberts">Adele Robert</a> 's now infamous luxury item.</p>
      <p>The radio DJs competed in a horrifying Bushtucker trial in tonight's ep, which saw them take on the first eating challenge of the series.</p>
      <p>As Adele tried to stomach Piggy Pudding, which was pig's uterus, she gagged as it "popped" in her mouth.</p>
      <p>Roman encouraged her: "Think how proud Jane is going to be!", referring to Adele's framed photo of Loose Women's Jane McDonald in the camp.</p>
      <p>The two previously got into a row over the photo when Roman was confused as to why Adele loved Jane so much, so the cheeky quip shows he's still dubious over the luxury item.</p>

      <p>But they did both give the photo a lucky rub before they headed off to the challenge.</p>
      <p>The trial also saw Roman tuck into Critter-Bocker Glory, which was made up of dead cockroaches, crickets and mealworms.</p>
      <p>Poor Roman had to eat three of each.</p>
      <p>Adele then tried Tirrama-spew, which was vomit fruit. "It's basically like eating a piece of fruit" said Dec. "Which tastes like vomit."</p>

      <p>Retching, Adele complained: "It's like your dog's been sick and you have to eat it!"Â </p>
      <p>Roman the had to eat Licky Toffee Pudding, which was duck's tongues.</p>
      <p>He managed to eat three by pretending to himself that it was calamari.</p>
      <p>It was Adele's turn again next and she was served Profiter-balls which were turkey testicles.</p>

      <p>Roman tried to help but making her think of Christmas, and they all ended up singing "The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year".</p>
      <p>"I will never eat turkey again" declared Adele.</p>
      <p>Roman was served Mississippi Udder Pie which was a cow's teat, and Eye-full which were fish eyes, and his final dish was Cocky Road Ice Cream - a bull's penis.</p>

      <p>Adele was left with Chocolate Gat-Toe, which was a sheep's toe, and Creme Poo-Lee which was a camel's anus.</p>
      <p>The pair got a full house and ten stars for camp.</p>
      <p>On their way back to camp, Adele laughed: "Lovely first date!"</p>
