      <h1>CERT-In issues security advisory to WhatsApp users</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:11:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/ajith-athrady" target="_blank">Ajith Athrady</a></address>
      <p>Indian cyber security agency CERT-In has warned WhatsApp users about the "vulnerability" that can compromise their individual account, even as the US-based company said that it is taking all security measures to address the concerns.</p>
      <p>The Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In), a nodal agency to combat hacking and phishing, has issued an advisory in this context calling the severity of the threat, being spread by an MP4 file, as "high."</p>
      <p>The agency also suggested WhatsApp users upgrade their app to the latest version to tide over the problem.</p>
      <p>“A vulnerability has been reported in WhatsApp which could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system,” the CERT-In said.</p>
      <p>“A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in WhatsApp due to improper parsing of elementary stream metadata of an MP4 file. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted MP4 file to the target system,” it warned.</p>
      <p>The exploitation does not require any form of authentication from the victim end and executes on downloading of malicious crafted mp4 file on victims system, it said.</p>
      <p>The government agency said half-a-dozen WhatsApp software have been "affected" by the current vulnerability.</p>
      <p>However, WhatsApp spokesperson said that in this instance there is no reason to believe users were impacted."</p>
      <p>Separately, Facebook-owned company written to the government expressing "regret" over the Pegasus snooping row, and has assured that it is taking all security measures to address concerns.</p>
      <p>The company is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of its users in India by providing industry-leading security for all messages and calls and by staying ahead of advanced threats to user security", the US based company said.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Facebook-owned company had said that 121 Indian users including journalists and human rights activists were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities using Israel developed Pegasus spyware.</p>
