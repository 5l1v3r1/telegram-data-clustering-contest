      <h1>You might be able to schedule tweets from Twitter’s web app starting today</h1>
      <h2>You used to have to use Tweetdeck or another service</h2>

      <p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1197214465231601671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197214465231601671&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2019%2F11%2F20%2Ftwitter-schedule-tweets-web%2F">Twitter announced</a> that it’s rolling out an “experiment” of a new tweet scheduling feature that you can use right from Twitter’s web app (<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/20/twitter-schedule-tweets-web/">via <i>9to5Mac</i></a>). The new feature could be handy to prep tweets for a coordinated product launch or news announcement, for example. But until today, it wasn’t something you could do on Twitter’s web app — you would have had to use TweetDeck or a third-party service like Buffer.</p>
      <p>If you’re part of the experiment, you’ll be able to schedule a tweet right from the compose window. Here’s what the process looks like — it seems pretty straightforward:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s unclear how many people are part of Twitter’s test — I don’t have access to the test yet, for example. Given that Twitter has said it’s only “experimenting” with the feature for now, there’s no way to know when — or if — it’ll be available to all users. Hopefully Twitter does roll it out more broadly, though, and perhaps the company will bring tweet scheduling to its mobile apps someday, too.</p>
