      <p>‘I’m not claiming that our craft is the panacea for all ills, I’d never do that, mainly because I don’t know what panacea means, but from the beginning of time there has been a need for people to express themselves artistically – yes, we are the modern day equivalent of cave drawings – but that need is what allows the world to breathe, to take some time to interpret the chaos and, quite simply, to just experience some joy. As Picasso said, Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.’</p>
