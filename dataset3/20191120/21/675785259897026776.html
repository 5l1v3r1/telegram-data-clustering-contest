      <h2>Royal Author Penny Junor said Prince Andrew, The Duke Of York, had been' forced out' by public outcry and his announcement caps off a 'disastrous year' for the monarchy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:31:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The Queen is "horrified" at Prince Andrew being forced out public life by the outcry over his links to paedo billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>Royal author Penny Junor said it has been a "disastrous year" for the Monarchy due to a series of controversial events, capped off by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-prince-andrew-stepping-down-20924010">the Duke of York announcing tonight</a> that he was stepping back from public duties "for the foreseeable future".</p>
      <p>In a statement released today - the 72nd wedding anniversary of the Queen and Prince Philip - Andrew revealed he had "asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission."</p>
      <p>He has asked his mother, The Queen, for permission to step down after his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrews-offer-emily-maitlis-20906257">widely-criticised TV interview with the BBC</a> over his relationship with billionaire paedophile Epstein.</p>
      <p>Royal writer Ms Junor described tonight's events as "absolutely unprecedented".</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She said: "This is absolutely unprecedented that a fairly senior member of the royal family should be forced to retire from public life.</p>
      <p>"I would think the Queen is horrified."</p>
      <p>But she added: "It was inevitable and it was the right thing to do. It was the only course of action for the duke and the royal family.</p>
      <p>"It's probably averted a crisis, with all the events of the last year put together, I think the monarchy is going through very difficult times.</p>
      <p>"All the Harry and Meghan stuff, the stories about Zara and Fergie accepting money from a Chinese businessman. I think it's been a disastrous year.</p>
      <p>"The hard-working members of the family - Prince Charles, Camilla, William and Kate and the Queen have all done sterling work but I think a lot of that has been overshadowed by other things."</p>

      <p>Social historian Professor Judith Rowbotham of the University of Plymouth compared the developments to the abdication of Edward VIII.</p>
      <p>"I suppose the nearest would be the Duke of Windsor in some way. There are plenty of parallels there," she said.</p>
      <p>"I'm far from surprised because the Duke of York was ill-advised to undertake the interview."</p>
      <p>Ms Junor said the abdication of the Duke of Windsor, who abdicated as Edward VIII in 1936, "in a way was different.</p>
      <p>"The Duke of Windsor chose love over duty and couldn't do both and decided to go off and marry and abdicate the crown," she said.</p>

      <p>"But Andrew has really been forced out. It's been forced on him by the huge outcry from the public.</p>
      <p>"The public were very, very disappointed in him."</p>
      <p>Professor Rowbotham said Andrew made a wise choice by not drawing the matter out for any longer.</p>
      <p>"I don't think it's a monarchy in crisis. Even with a slimmed down monarchy, you have a large royal family, humanly-speaking somebody is always going to do something that gets well and truly disapproved of," she said.</p>
      <p>"It could have escalated into a more major crisis if the Duke of York had not done the honourable thing."</p>

      <p>Professor Rowbotham suggested the difficulties the royal family, including the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, had faced in 2019 were not as bad as the Queen's annus horribilis of 1992.</p>
      <p>"Back in 1992, it was an annus horribilis. This has been a 'few weeks horribilis'," she suggested.</p>
      <p>She added that Andrew's decision would be one of personal sadness for the monarch.</p>
      <p>"I think it will be a great sadness for the Queen," she said.</p>
      <h3>Queen carrying on</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile the Queen was pictured carrying on with professional duties just hours after letting Prince Andrew quit public life.</p>
      <p>She presented the 2019 Chatham House Prize to British broadcaster David Attenborough at an event in central London this evening for his hit BBC nature series Blue Planet II.</p>
      <p>She was snapped leaving Buckingham Palace shortly after approving her second son’s statement.</p>
      <h3>Andrew 'could be cut out of core royal circle when Charles becomes king'</h3>
      <p>On Saturday, a day after Andrew's car-crash interview with Newsnight, Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the Duke could find himself out of the core royal family.</p>
      <p>That's if reports are correct that the monarchy will be slimmed down when Prince Charles becomes king.</p>
      <p>She said: "It was a very probing interview he's not used to being questioned in that way and I think he seemed unable to really answer her questions with any conviction.</p>
      <p>"I think myself and most other people think that the interview was a mistake.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I think the Duke of York is very anxious to carry on with the work that he's doing, but of course he's totally smeared by this Epstein business and until that is dealt with I think he's going to find it very hard to carry on as normal.</p>
      <p>"He will of course, because that's what people do, but I think it's always going to be in the background."</p>
      <p>She went on to say: "I think if there's a slimmed down monarchy I very much feel Andrew won't be a huge part in it."</p>
      <h3>'Biggest crisis'</h3>
      <p>Public relations and crisis consultant Mark Borkowski described the events as the biggest crisis the royal family has faced since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the Netflix drama The Crown, which chronicles the monarchy, he said: "This actually kicks The Crown into a cocked hat, the producers of The Crown must be kicking themselves because they haven't got anything in the current series that is so topical and real as this, because it's got all the stuff of the past, wrapped into now.</p>
      <p>"I read that statement and thought it's a fantastic statement but three years too late, if he had written that statement three years ago distancing himself from Epstein none of this would've happened."</p>

      <p>Mr Borkowski said the crisis would have overshadowed the work of all the royal family for months to come, who would have been questioned about Andrew, as even the political leaders of the two main parties were in their televised debate on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>He added: "They wouldn't have had a single moment to not think about how they're going to address this question. It was like the biggest elephant in the room and whoever has taken control, has shot the elephant and saved the royal family."</p>
      <h3>'A very arrogant man'</h3>
      <p>Royal biographer Christopher Warwick told PA: "If Prince Andrew thought this interview was going to draw a line under this then his lack of judgment for that was as bad as his lack of judgment over maintaining his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>"He didn't understand what public opinion would be."</p>

      <p>When asked if the prince could ever return to his duties, he replied: "It's anybody's guess. This is not going to die for a very long time."</p>
      <p>He described the prince as "a very arrogant man," saying: "Back in the 80s when he was out in the Falklands and his joyful return, followed not long after by his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, that's probably the highest point of Prince Andrew's popularity - since then it's been a slippery slope."</p>
      <h3>Prince Andrew's statement in full -</h3>
      <p>
        <i>"It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</i>
