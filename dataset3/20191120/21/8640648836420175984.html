      <p>HAYWARD, Calif. — A man died after being <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/fight-leads-to-fatal-stabbing-aboard-san-francisco-area-train-1896430/">stabbed with his own knife on a California commuter train</a> while trying to stop the attacker from stealing the shoes of a sleeping passenger, authorities said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>During the confrontation Tuesday in the San Francisco Bay Area, the victim pulled a knife that was wrestled away by the attacker and used to stab him several times, Bay Area Rapid Transit officials said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Jermaine Jeremiah Brim, 39, of Sacramento was arrested near the Hayward station after he tried to steal a van at a car dealership, authorities said.</p>
      <p>It was unclear if Brim has an attorney.</p>
      <p>The arrest came after officers boarded the train and found the victim bleeding. He died at the scene. His name has been withheld pending notification to his family.</p>
      <p>As a safety precaution, the agency said it will increase the presence of police officers on trains and at station platforms.</p>
      <p>“We are heartbroken that a person has lost his life due to violence on one of our trains,” Robert Powers, the agency’s general manager, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The stabbing followed the high-profile death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson, who was stabbed last year in an unprovoked attack on her and her sister in an Oakland BART station.</p>
      <p>John Cowell, a 27-year-old parolee, was found competent to stand trial but his case is in legal limbo. A judge in October agreed to seal a motion by Cowell’s attorney to dismiss the case.</p>
      <p>The family of Wilson claims BART failed in its duty to ensure its customers are safe.</p>
