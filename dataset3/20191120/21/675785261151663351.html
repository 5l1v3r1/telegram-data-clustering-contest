      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Ryan-Mark has lashed out at businesswoman Marianne, who he accused of having a 'personal vendetta' against her</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:58:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan-Mark Parsons has opened up about an explosive row between himself and Marianne Rawlins, who he also branded a "waste of space", which wasn't aired in tonight's Apprentice episode.</p>
      <p>The luxury womenswear consultant, 19, became the latest casualty of the boardroom after finally becoming project manager this evening.</p>
      <p>However he has lashed out at co-star Marianne, 36, who he claims had a "personal vendetta" against him and branded their relationship "toxic".</p>
      <p>Opening up about a furious row they had, which didn't feature in tonight's episode, he told Mirror TV: "We didn't see eye-to-eye on a professional level or a personal level. There's an argument that we had that hasn't made it onto the episode that really highlighted the nature of our relationship and it's very toxic.</p>

      <p>"Marianne was accusing me of making incorrect decisions or being a poor leader - being very patronising.</p>
      <p>"And I was just dismissing her and Lewis was aggravating the situation and he was really ticking me off at that stage in the car. This was in the car on the way to the corporate activities."</p>
      <p>He added: "Marianne really is a waste of space, I have to say. I just feel that she is very naive. When I worked with her on the task, she's all over the place. Quite erratic, I would say.</p>
      <p>"Then when it comes to the boardroom there's a very sudden switch and she becomes very malicious. I said she's a bit like a troll in that she lurks under the bridge and she grabs your leg and pulls you into the river."</p>

      <p>The eccentric candidate confirmed that he had had bust-ups with Marianne in the past.</p>
      <p>"We clashed that other time in the boardroom and she made again wild accusations about me. I contributed so much to that task," he told us. "The fact that she was saying I did nothing, I was a burden and I was detrimental, etc. really p***ed me off.</p>
      <p>"The thing is, Marianne has a lot to say, she comes across as this expert who brings so much to the table but really she's quite hollow."</p>
      <p>He also addressed claims from other contestants that he was being "fake".</p>

      <p>"That's completely crazy," Ryan-Mark said. "I'm the same in the house as I am on camera. Naturally you have to step it up when you're on a task to try to outshine the others and you need to do better and you need to show Karen and Claude, who are following you everywhere, that you'll do well.</p>
      <p>"So naturally you're going to be slightly different to what you're like in the house. I don't think it's manageable to be the same on the task as you are in the house. I'm not being false or anything."</p>
      <p>Asked who he got on well with in the house, Ryan-Mark said: "Overall, I got on with quite a lot of people - Thomas, Dean, on a personal level, Lewis, really liked Lewis, Lottie. Just some people like Marianne, Jemelin, Riyonn... I didn't like at all."</p>
