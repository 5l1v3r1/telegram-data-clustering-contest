      <p><b>OSAKA — </b>Two new Pokemon video games sold around 1.37 million copies in Japan within the first three days of their release, a record for any title developed for Nintendo Co's Switch console, an estimate by a weekly game magazine showed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Pokemon Sword" and "Pokemon Shield," released worldwide last Friday as the first installments in the eighth generation of the Pokemon role-playing game series, will add to other recent titles such as "Super Mario Maker 2" in lifting sales of the Switch and its software.</p>
      <p>The figure released by Kadokawa Corp, publisher of Shukan Famitsu magazine, does not include sales of download versions of the latest Pokemon titles.</p>
      <p>The previous record was set in 2018 by crossover fighting game "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate," which sold around 1.24 million copies in three days.</p>
      <p>Sales of the Switch console, launched in 2017, have also been steadily increasing since the release of the new Pokemon games, according to the magazine.</p>
      <p>Aiming to revive sales of the Switch, Nintendo updated the model with a longer battery life in August and added the smaller and lighter Nintendo Switch Lite to the lineup in September.</p>
