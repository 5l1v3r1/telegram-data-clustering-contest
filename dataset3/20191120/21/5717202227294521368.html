      <p>West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur face off in the Premier League this weekend, and apparently the clubs share an an interest in the same player.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/357211/calciomercato_verona_esclusivo_due_big_osservano_amrabat">According to Calciomercato</a>, the London sides are keeping tabs on Sofyan Amrabat of Club Brugge.</p>
      <p>The Morocco international is currently on loan at Serie A outfit Hellas Verona, where he is impressing having started in all but one league game so far.</p>

      <p>Him playing in the Italian top-flight has meant he has also caught the attention of Inter Milan, Napoli and Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>The ball is firmly in Hellas’ court right now, as there is supposedly a €3.5 million/£3 million option to buy in place with Brugge.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Spurs’ appointment of Jose Mourinho as the new manager will mean he remains a target.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – West Ham need Amrabat more</h3>
      <p>Realistically it’s West Ham who are most in need of Amrabat.</p>
      <p>The star is a holding midfield player and at the moment, Declan Rice is Manuel Pellegrini’s only true option for the position.</p>

      <p>Mark Noble partners Rice, but the 20-year-old is the one that anchors the midfield, with Noble slightly further forward when in possession.</p>
      <p>Carlos Sanchez has had countless chances to prove himself but isn’t good enough, and so Amrabat could come in and shake things up.</p>
      <p>That is, of course, assuming Hellas are down to make a quick profit.</p>
