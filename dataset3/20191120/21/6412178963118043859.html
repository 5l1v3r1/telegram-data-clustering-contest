        <b>Jose Mourinho is planning another raid on Lille after poaching two members of their coaching staff, according to reports in France.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/jose-mourinho-explains-tottenham-ambitions-after-succeeding-pochettino-on-big-money-deal"><b>After being announced as the replacement for Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham on Wednesday morning</b></a>, Mourinho has quickly set to work at his new club, using his good relationship with Lille director Luis Campos to snap up two coaches from the French club, Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos.</p>
      <p>Now, <i><a href="https://www.jeunesfooteux.com/LOSC-Mercato-enorme-coup-dur-pour-Lille-et-Galtier-_a39165.html">Jeunes Footeux</a> </i>claim that Mourinho is set to look to Lille again for reinforcements in his playing squad – with two targets in mind.</p>
      <p>Striker Victor Osimhen is viewed as an ideal addition to the frontline, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/osimhen-to-tottenham-reports-just-speculation"><b>four years on from initial links with Spurs</b></a>, due to his ability to play either as a central striker or a winger. Having scored seven goals in the league so far this season – <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/willian-marks-chelsea-milestone-with-goal-as-lampard-gets-first-cl-win"><b>as well as finding the net against Chelsea in the Champions League</b></a> – he sits fourth in the Ligue 1 scoring charts.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is also said to be keen on defensive midfielder Boubakary Soumaré, who has also been a key component for the side this season as they battle for a European place.</p>
