      <h1>There Are Conflicting Reports About A Potential ‘Joker’ Sequel &amp; It’s Some Real Clown Energy</h1>

      <p>If you were part of the angry mob who protested <i>Joker</i> then the joke’s on you ‘coz following the wild success of the film, a sequel is already in the works… we think?</p>
      <p>Overnight, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">The Hollywood Reporter</a> learned from sneaky sources that a follow-up flick was in the works after director<b> Todd Phillips</b> marched into the office of Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman <b>Toby Emmerich </b>and pitched an “outsized idea” that he ate up with a spoon.</p>
      <p>Apparently Phillips also left the meeting with the rights to at least one other DC story, sources say, so it looks like we can expect another DC origin story to be told.</p>
      <p>While THR is a very reputable source, an equally reputable source denies such meeting ever took place.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a>, there have been “no deals for a sequel, nor even any negotiations with director Todd Phillips or his co-writer <b>Scott Silver</b> to craft one.”</p>
      <p>Multiple sources said no such October 7 meeting between Phillips and Emmerich ever went down, and that Phillips doesn’t want to follow <i>Joker</i> by overseeing other DC character films.</p>
      <p>Well fuck us then.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to know which source is accurate, TBH, considering they both have pretty legit insiders. Perhaps word got out too quick about the potential ‘Joker 2’ and Warner Bros. is trying to hush the rumours by poo-pooing them?</p>

      <p>my clown ass hoping the rumours are true</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> recently crossed the $1 billion mark, becoming the highest grossing Warners release ever in 10 markets and highest grossing DC title in 36.</p>
      <p>So given the money hungry nature of Warner Bros., it wouldn’t surprise me if a sequel’s already being talked about.</p>
