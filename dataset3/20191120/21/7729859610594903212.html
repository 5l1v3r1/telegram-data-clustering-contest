      <p>The month-long transfer window for English clubs opens on January 1, with the Blues having already served one of its two-transfer-window ban on registering new players.</p>
      <p>Chelsea is challenging verdicts by FIFA's disciplinary and appeal committees that the club violated 150 rules on the transfers of minors. Those cases involved about 70 players.</p>
      <p>Chelsea also broke rules prohibiting third-party influence on players, for which FIFA imposes a fine of just under Â£500,000.</p>
      <p>The club has denied wrongdoing.</p>
