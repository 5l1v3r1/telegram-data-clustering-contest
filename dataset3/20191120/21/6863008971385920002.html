      <p>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) office in the city of Aksai, Rostov Region, arrested a Russian military serviceman on suspicion of high treason.</p>
      <p>It's the Ukrainian military intelligence that has allegedly recruited the military, security officials claim, according to the FSB press service.</p>
      <p>The man was tasked with gathering military secrets, whose leak to a foreign government could "damage Russia's defense capability", the report says.</p>
      <p>Investigative actions are underway.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, Russian puppet occupation authorities in Luhansk sentenced a local resident to 12 years for "espionage in favor of Ukraine."</p>
