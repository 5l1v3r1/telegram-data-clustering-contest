      <p>MUMBAI: Indian satellite pioneer and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Essel-Group">Essel Group</a> chairman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Subhash-Chandra">Subhash Chandra</a> will sell 16.5% in flagship <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zee-tv">Zee Entertainment Enterprises</a> to financial investors as he makes a second attempt to raise money to retire debt. Once the stake sale is completed, Chandra will be left with 5% in Zee, a company he founded in 1982.</p>
      <p>Of the 5%, 1.1% is pledged with financial institutions, and the rest is unencumbered. The group said the promoters will continue to remain on the board with Chandra’s oldest son Punit Goenka managing the show at Zee. The stake-sale, said Essel Group, is to repay loan obligations “to certain lenders for whose benefit such shares are currently encumbered”.</p>

      <p>US-based investment manager <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Invesco">Invesco</a> Oppenheimer will become the largest shareholder of Zee with 19% following the sale. Invesco, which checked into Zee 17 years ago, currently holds 16.4%. Its stake will go up after it buys an additional 2.3% of the total shares on the block. Invesco hasn’t sought a representation on the board of Zee yet.</p>
      <p>The transaction will not trigger an open offer because the management remains the same and Invesco holds less than the threshold limit of 25% for making an open offer.</p>
      <p>The Essel Group has a debt of Rs 7,000 crore, of which it owes Rs 5,000 crore to domestic lenders and Rs 2,000 crore to Russia’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/VTB-Capital">VTB Capital</a>. Chandra, a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/rice">rice</a> trader-turned-media magnate, is working to further divest other media and non-media businesses and he “remains confident of completing the same”.</p>
      <p>Chandra hopes to raise at least Rs 4,389 crore ($611 million) from the latest sale of 16.5% in Zee. In July 2019, Chandra raised Rs 3,456 crore by selling 8.7% to Invesco, which enabled the US fund to raise its stake to 16.4% from 7.7%.</p>
      <p>Of the 16.5% put up for sale by the Essel Group, 15.72% will be sold in the market through accelerated book building. In this method, the book is built through the night and will be executed in Thursday’s early trade. The remainder 0.78% will be sold through a separate deal. Citi, which is managing the stake sale, has sent out term sheets to institutional players to bid for the number of Zee shares they are willing to buy. The Zee stock will be sold at a minimum price of Rs 277 apiece, a 10% discount to Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 307 on the NSE.</p>
      <p>Chandra has been in a financial problem due to bets made on the infrastructure sector. The situation worsened for him following the NBFC crisis. And to tide over it, he offered shares of Zee as collateral. The debt subsequently became a concern with investors, causing the Zee stock to tumble.</p>
