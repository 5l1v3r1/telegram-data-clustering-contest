      <p>If you’ve never heard of it or you blocked the memory of playing the game due to <i>rust issues</i>, here’s the skinny on FacePunch Studio’s game Rust: It’s basically naked and afraid but everyone wants to kill you. The godfather of survival games that pop you into a world where you’re able to enter an infinite grind to create materials for various stuff, Rust has been kicking around since 2013 in Early Access and finally went into full release mode back in 2018.</p>
      <p>The game has its fans, many of whom are vocal and incredibly hostile to Sandy for having an honest opinion on the game being kind of <i>terrible </i><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rust-review-life-is-fleeting/1900-6416858/">after he plugged over 30 hours into it</a>. Anyway, there is a Rust community out there and they love the game. So they’ll probably be ready to pony up some cash for Rust’s first slice of premium DLC: Musical instruments.</p>

      <p>In I crap thee not news, Rust will offer a full band’s worth of playable instruments which include everything from a piano, drums and even a cowbell. I’ve gotta have more cowbell yo. While there will be a discount on the goodies once they arrive on December 5, the regular price for them will be $10 after a short introductory period. So what’s the big deal then? According to the Rust devs, these instruments won’t just be single-key fancy emotes, but they’ll make use of their own control scheme that dedicates a key to each note.</p>
      <p>In other words, there’s an art to using them. “We’ve created a whole new control system to play the instruments,” <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/instrument-pack-dlc">the Rust Dev blog explained</a>.</p>

      <blockquote>You can now bind the standard note range (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) to any key. From there you can bind sharp and octave modifier keys which allow you to play over 20 notes on some instruments. If you’ve got a MIDI device sitting around you can plug it in and play most instruments in real-time. MIDI devices allow for a much more accurate and fast paced playing style. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled in the experimental options section.</blockquote>
      <p>That’s…kind of cool actually. Here’s what it looks like in action:</p>

      <p>Hopefully, the key takeaway to all this, is that when you’ve been murdered by a band of roving Sousaphone-toting maniacs that at least one of them will grab a trumpet and play you a melancholic send-off.</p>
