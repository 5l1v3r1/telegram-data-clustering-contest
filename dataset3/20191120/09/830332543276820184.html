      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Madison police are searching for a group of teenagers they say robbed a gas station on the city's west side overnight.</p>
      <p>Police say the Speedway Gas Station at Verona Road and Raymond Road was robbed at gunpoint while the clerk was closing the store just before midnight. The clerk described the suspects as wearing black ski masks over their faces and showing what appeared to be a silver handgun. The gun had brown grips and green sights, leading police to believe it was possibly a BB gun or an Airsoft gun.</p>
      <p>One of the suspects was described as being about 15 years old, while another was described as 18 years old. Police say a third suspect was also involved.</p>
      <p>The suspects ran away from the store and have not been caught.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should call the Madison Police Department or Madison Area Crime Stoppers.</p>
