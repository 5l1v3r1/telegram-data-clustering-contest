      <p>Christopher Biggins is worried that pantomime stars like the Krankies will abandon the festive plays due to ‘political correctness’.</p>
      <p>Biggins is a staple of the pantomime scene, having played Widow Twankey in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aladdin/">Aladdin</a> and Buttons in Cinderella.</p>
      <p>However, although he is returning to Aladdin this Christmas in Bromley, Biggins claims pantos are getting ‘ridiculous’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/christopher-biggins-slams-snowflakes-taking-20917421">The 70-year-old told The Daily Star:</a> ‘The Krankies have stopped doing pantomime because it’s getting so ridiculous.</p>

      <p>‘Panto is a British institution. It’s just a joke. It’s only tongue in cheek.’</p>
      <p>The Porridge star also told the paper that he and other longtime panto stars have met up to discuss the future of pantomime, but is ‘determined’ not to give into political correctness.</p>
      <p>While Biggins suggested that the Krankies – made up of husband and wife Janette and Ian Tough – were quitting panto due to worries they would be accused of transphobia, the couple actually retired from panto this year due to Janette’s health issues.</p>

      <p>The Scottish star <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4336735/the-krankies-panto-pantomime-glasgow-scotland-jimmy-krankie/">told The Sun:</a> ‘It’s no good for my back being thrown around.</p>
      <p>‘I know it was one part of our act that people really seemed to like but I’ll never play the dummy again. I can say it’s on doctor’s orders.</p>
      <p>‘We’re both 72 now and feel the time is right to call it a day. But we’re not giving up the business — just pantos.’</p>
      <p>The Krankies last appeared in Cinderella in Glasgow in 2018.</p>
