      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s girlfriend Sophia Hutchins has admitted it’s been ‘gut-wrenching’ watching the 70-year-old break down on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!.</p>
      <p>After just one night in camp, the Keeping up With The Kardashians star was in buckets of tears and came dangerously close to quitting the series.</p>
      <p>Sophia lives with Caitlyn in their luxury Malibu mansion, and appeared on today’s Lorraine revealing it’s been a struggle watching her loved one in camp.</p>
      <p>‘It hasn’t been easy to watch at all. When you’re watching someone from across the globe you feel helpless to begin with,’ explained Sophia. ‘And then when you see her crying it’s been gut wrenching to watch with everyone, and I’m watching with you.</p>
      <p>‘Producers take away everyone’s phones and we have no communication, which is interesting and difficult to deal with.’</p>

      <p>Caitlyn has gone from strength to strength in the jungle, suddenly becoming among the favourites to win – despite blanking Roman Kemp. From opening about her transition to starting to spill secrets about the Kardashians, ITV more than getting their money’s worth with their reported £500,000 signing.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Jane McDonald superfan Adele Roberts, the reality TV icon opened up about her relationship with son-in-law Kayne West.</p>
      <p>Last night Ant and Dec followed in Kim Kardashian’s footsteps to break the internet as they sang Kylie Jenner’s Rise and Shine to the former Olympian.</p>
      <p>It was gold.</p>
