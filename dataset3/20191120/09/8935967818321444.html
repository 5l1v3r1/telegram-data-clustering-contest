      <p>SFR has started selling a smart home automation range that comes with a dedicated app, featuring products from Legrand, Netatmo and Nest, among others. Grouped under the 'SFR Home' brand, the new offering has its own <a href="https://boutique.home.sfr.fr/">website</a> and includes three main product bundles. The entry-level pack is priced at EUR 69, while the other two require a monthly subscription in addition to the one-off cost of the equipment (EUR 149).</p>
      <p>Named Connected Pack ('Pack Connecte'), the entry-level product bundle combines a Wi-Fi camera, a connected colour bulb and a smart plug. SFR said that its internet customers will also have the option to purchase an 'Alert' add-on for EUR 2 per month, which saves video recording from the camera for up to 30 days and sends a message to the smartphone in case of intrusion.</p>
      <p>As announced in July, households equipped with the operator's latest STB, <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/sfr-to-launch-premium-stb-on-20-august--1301382">SFR Box 8</a>, will be able to control connected products using voice commands via the 'OK SFR' assistant.</p>
