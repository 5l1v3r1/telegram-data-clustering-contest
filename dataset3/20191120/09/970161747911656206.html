      <p>Good Morning Britain’s Susanna Reid has joked that the rest of the presenters could face having their wages cut to accommodate Piers Morgan.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/piers-morgan-confirms-quit-good-morning-britain-january-ahead-show-extension-11173138/"> Piers confirmed that he could be leaving the breakfast programme</a> ahead of the show’s time extension and has previously disclosed that his contract runs out on New Year’s Eve.</p>
      <p>Discussing Piers’ future as co-host, Susanna suggested that he could soon be replaced by longstanding rival <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bbc-breakfast/">BBC Breakfast</a>’s Dan Walker.</p>

      <p>‘If your contract negotiations don’t work out perhaps he’ll be sitting in your seat,’ she remarked.</p>
      <p>‘Or perhaps I’ll be sitting in his seat. BBC…,’ Piers clapped back.</p>
      <p>Susanna then joked: ‘BBC can’t afford you, sorry… We can barely afford you. The rest of us might have to take a cut if we want you back here in January.’</p>

      <p>Piers then explained to Susanna and viewers at home that they must comprehend their worth during contract negotiations.</p>
      <p>‘You have to understand your own value and then you have to stick to it,’ Piers said. ‘I value myself at X You value me at Y therefore, I’m taking my toys out of the pram and going to Z.’</p>
      <p>Ever the diva, eh?</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/morning-get-even-longer-itv-revamps-morning-schedule-11083364/">Good Morning Britain is due to get an extended time slot</a> in the new year, adding half an hour to fill in the gap in an overhaul of the ITV morning schedule.</p>
      <p>From 6 January 2020, Good Morning Britain will be extended by half an hour to run from 6am until 9am – that’s three whole hours of Piers Morgan (should he stick around).</p>
      <p>Lorraine will move to 9am, and will be followed by This Morning at 10am, extended by 30 minutes, before Loose Women at 12.30pm, ending at 1.30pm.</p>
