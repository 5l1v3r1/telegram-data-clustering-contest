      <p>Completion rates for students in School District No. 73 have reached an all-time high in the district, according to the BC Ministry of Education stats released this month.</p>
      <p>The graduation rate measures the number of Grade 8 students who graduate within six years. The six-year rate for all SD73 students in the 2018-2019 school year is 88.3 per cent, and the rate for Aboriginal students is 84.1 per cent. This is an increase from 83.7 and 78.2 per cent, respectively.</p>
      <p>“School District No. 73 has made successful school completion for all learners, and closing the completion rate gap between Aboriginal Learners and All Learners, a priority,” said Alison Sidow, Superintendent for SD 73. “I would like to thank staff for their efforts, which have resulted in this significant achievement in school completion rates and I share in their goals to continue this work to ensure that all students graduate.”</p>
      <p>The completion rate for B.C. resident students in the district (excluding international students who move out of the district before graduation) is even higher, at 92.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>The District’s commitment to this priority is reflected in four broad categories: personalized learning that provides flexibility and choice; a focus on inclusion and equity; structured support for struggling learners; and connecting learners to opportunities to complete after they have discontinued schooling.</p>
