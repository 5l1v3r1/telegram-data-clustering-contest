      <p>ISLAMABAD -- A radical Pakistani cleric and other opposition leaders have called on their supporters to stop blocking roads in the country's major cities, saying the protest action is harming ordinary people.<br/><br/>Addressing a news conference in Islamabad late on November 19, the opposition leaders also vowed to continue to press for the resignation of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government.<br/><br/>The opposition claims Khan is incompetent and that his government was illegitimately installed by Pakistan's military after a rigged general election in 2018.<br/><br/>Anti-government protests led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the leader of the Islamist Jamiat Ulema-e Islam party, began last month with an Azadi (Freedom) March from the southern city of Karachi to Islamabad.<br/><br/>Tens of thousands of supporters reached the capital on October 31 and started a sit-in on the city's main highway, calling for new general elections.<br/><br/>But Rehman on November 13 called off the two-week sit-in and told his supporters to start blocking roads across the country.<br/><br/>Khan came to power last year promising to end corruption, help middle-class families, and get the country's faltering economy on track. But his government was forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a $6 billion bailout in July.<br/><br/>The military has ruled Pakistan for almost half of its existence since the country's independence from Britain in 1947.<br/><br/>No Pakistani prime minister has completed a full term in office in 70 years.</p>
