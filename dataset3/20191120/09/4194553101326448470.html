      <h1>Wijnaldum’s post-match tweet is pure class as Dutch Gini strikes thrice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:03:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Gini Wijnaldum posted two messages on Twitter yesterday.</p>
      <p>The first was a #StopRacism post, one day after he’d <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/18/furious-gini-wijnaldum-sends-strong-message-to-authorities-following-racism-in-dutch-second-division/">spoken loudly about the issue in a pre-match conference.</a></p>
      <blockquote>Enough Is Enough!! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopRacism?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StopRacism</a> 🤜🏻🤛🏿 <a href="https://t.co/W9Ra38DVFs">pic.twitter.com/W9Ra38DVFs<br/></a>— Gini Wijnaldum (@GWijnaldum) <a href="https://twitter.com/GWijnaldum/status/1196796792718929920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>The second was one of celebration, after he’d scored three goals as captain to help Netherlands down Estonia 4-0.</p>
      <blockquote>What a night!! Unbelievably honoured to make my debut as captain today, to combine that with 3 goals is just unforgettable 🙏🏾 So excited for the summer with this incredible squad! 🔶🦁 We are one team 🤜🏻🤛🏾 <a href="https://t.co/KtuMKuiIGC">pic.twitter.com/KtuMKuiIGC<br/></a>— Gini Wijnaldum (@GWijnaldum) <a href="https://twitter.com/GWijnaldum/status/1196928507235971073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>As days go, it’s fair to say that yesterday was one where Holland’s no.8 covered himself in glory on and off the field.</p>
      <p>Now, we welcome him back to Liverpool full of confidence.</p>
      <p>He’s a machine physically, so should be totally fine to start at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.</p>
