      <p>A male young adult appearing to be in their 20's has stolen my son's 2018 Specialized Black mountain bike (29er size) with red trim from the front of our yard at 8:12 PM on Tuesday (11/19). My son rides this to school every day.</p>
      <p>We're on Arroyo Ave across from SBCC. The suspect came and left from the east side of Arroyo, we caught him on video.</p>
