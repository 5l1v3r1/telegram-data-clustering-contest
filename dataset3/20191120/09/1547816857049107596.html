      <p>The recently-released trailer of Ajay Devgn’s Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior has taken the internet by storm. Right from its spectacular visuals and VFX to all the remarkable performances; netizens can’t stop raving praises over this upcoming period drama. A lot of celebrities, too, have lauded Ajay Devgn for nailing Tanaji Malusare’s role with utmost perfection. The list also includes his Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam co-star and good friend, Salman Khan, who seems to be equally blown away by the trailer.</p>
      <p>A day after the trailer of Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior made it to the internet; the Dabangg actor took to his Twitter account and hailed Ajay Devgn’s performance in his style. Along with sharing the link, Khan wrote, “Tanhaji manaji.. Ajay vijay bhava vijay bhava vijay bhava . . . @ajaydevgn.” Well, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is a special film to Ajay Devgn for numerous reasons. Firstly, it’s his 100th Bollywood, and then it also reunites the actor with his wife Kajol and Omkara co-star Saif Ali Khan on the big screen.</p>

      <p>At the trailer launch, Saif Ali Khan and Ajay Devgn opened up on their experiences on working on the films. Saif said, “It was a very comfortable shoot and our director Om Raut focused a lot on my character. Even when I used to go for as many as 25 retakes to get it perfect, our director Om Raut used to be so supportive. Also, it wasn’t that the first and second takes weren’t that good. But, in my quest to get it perfect, I suggested we go for multiple retakes.”Ajay instantly jumped into the conversation and added, “Yeh apni perfection ke peeche pade the lekin ultimately, first take hi okay hue hai in the end.” LOL! (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/tanhaji-trailer-launch-ajay-devgn-reveals-why-kajol-is-missing-from-the-event-parent-duty-calls/5dd3b50887fb571eff7e416a">Tanhaji Trailer Launch: Ajay Devgn Reveals Why Kajol Is Missing From The Event- Parent Duty Calls!</a>)</p>
