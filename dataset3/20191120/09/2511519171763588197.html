      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/harry-connick-jr">Harry Connick Jr</a> has claimed that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> was “completely inappropriate” with his wife during a meeting in the Nineties.</p>
      <p>While appearing on <i>This Morning</i>, Connick Jr recalled performing in front of Sinatra at an event and being so nervous on stage that he later approached him in person to apologise.</p>
      <p>He then claimed that Sinatra ignored him and instead flirted with his then-girlfriend Jill Goodacre before kissing her on the lips.</p>
      <p>“[The performance] was an unpleasant experience because as much as I wanted to sing for him and everyone else… I don’t get nervous but I was really nervous for that and I blanked out,” he remembered.</p>
      <p>“I completely forget the words. I was with my wife, then my girlfriend, and then we saw Frank at the lift and I said, ‘We should go, I need to explain myself.’”</p>
      <p>He continued, “I said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m much better than what you saw,’ and he took my wife and held her face and said, ‘You’re beautiful,’ and kissed her on the mouth and that’s that.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve never been able to sing for him again. It was probably unacceptable then. It was a situation where it was an interesting thing. I think my affection for him in the context made it hilarious for her, but obviously it’s completely inappropriate.”</p>
      <p>Goodacre, an actor and model best known for being locked in an ATM vestibule with Matthew Perry’s Chandler Bing in an episode of <i>Friends</i>, married Connick Jr in 1994. They have three children.</p>
      <p>Investigative journalist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ronan-farrow">Ronan Farrow</a> was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/ronan-farrow-frank-sinatra-bill-maher-interview-woody-allen-catch-kill-a9182441.html">recently asked on live television to comment on long-standing rumours that Sinatra is his father</a>, despite film director Woody Allen being named as his father on his birth certificate.</p>
