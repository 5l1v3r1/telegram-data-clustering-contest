      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 20 — Shares in German payments firm Wirecard fell today on revelations that a 2017 audit of its troubled Singapore unit could not be completed, but the firm denied a media report blaming accounting “irregularities”.</p>
      <p>Hitting back at yesterday’s allegations by the German financial daily <i>Handelsblatt</i>, Wirecard said auditors from Ernst and Young (EY) could not finalise their local report because they could not access all the necessary documents.</p>
      <p>This was due to “restrictions” imposed by Singapore authorities who are investigating the unit’s accounting practices.</p>
      <p>“And not as mistakenly suggested in the article by irregularities,” Wirecard said.</p>
      <p>Shares in the company shed 5.2 per cent to €114.95 (RM529.57) by 10.20am (0920 GMT), making it the biggest loser in a DAX index down 0.97 per cent.</p>
      <p>In its statement, Wirecard stressed that EY had no trouble concluding its audits for the group as a whole in the financial years 2017 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares have been on a rollercoaster ride this year after a string of <i>Financial Times</i> articles accused it of cooking the books, which Wirecard has consistently rejected.</p>
      <p>Many of the fraud allegations have focused on its Singapore office.</p>
      <p>Before the controversy, Wirecard was long seen as a rising star of the “fintech” companies that are upending the traditional world of banking and payments.</p>
      <p>Massive growth in the electronic payments it guarantees in exchange for a commission has helped Wirecard, which was founded in 1999, shoot into the blue-chip DAX 30 index. — AFP</p>
