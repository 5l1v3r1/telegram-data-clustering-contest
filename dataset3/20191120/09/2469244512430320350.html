      <p>A magazine designed in North Devon and read across the country has won a prestigious national award.</p>
      <p>The Mole Valley Farmers CountryStore Magazine has been awarded Membership Publication of the Year at the recent PPA Independent Publisher Awards held in London. The CountryStore magazine overcame fierce competition from many well-known brands including The National Trust, The Arts Society, British Heart Foundation and Professional Engineering, to secure the top award.</p>
      <p>Julie Edwards, Head of Communications for Mole Valley Farmers, said: “We are thrilled to win this prestigious national award, especially as we were up against some well-established publications.</p>
      <p>“Our CountryStore magazine is very popular with members and its appeal with the readership grows with every edition. It contains an eclectic mix of articles, product-focused pages and competitions – so a little bit something for everyone. The magazine’s circulation now stands at just over 50,000, which is larger than the BBC’s Countryfile magazine.</p>
      <p>“We work very closely with the wonderful team at Salt Media, who publish this magazine for us. It is their creative flair, design talents and fun approach that have helped make the CountryStore magazine stand out from the crowd. This win is a great achievement for the teams at Mole Valley Farmers and Salt Media.”</p>

      <p>Media, Copy &amp; Production Manager Sarah Barclay added: “The CountryStore magazine has gone from strength to strength. With the clever design and editorial skills of Salt Media and technical knowledge of Mole Valley Farmers, we have covered topical issues for the rural and agricultural reader, which has gained the magazine and therefore Mole Valley Farmers customer loyalty and trust.</p>
      <p>“The readers engage with the content, and we often receive fantastic feedback. The uplift of circulation has bucked the trend of print which is a positive result. The partnership between Salt Media and Mole Valley Farmers has proved to be a winning combination in the eyes of our customers, long may it continue.”</p>
