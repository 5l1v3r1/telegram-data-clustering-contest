      <p>Automobili Pininfarina has just teased the Pura Vision at an exclusive event in Los Angeles. It is set to debut as the new S-LUV (Sustainable Luxury Utility Vehicle) at the Pebble Beach show in 2020.</p>

      <p>The new product will be part of its "2020 Vision" to transform its luxury EV business, which will see four new models including the Pura Vision.</p>
      <p>“Visionary Italian design is the past and the future and as we head towards celebrating Pininfarina’s 90th anniversary in 2020, we are inventing new markets and new client experiences, and we want to underscore our commitment to Italy through the production of pure-electric vehicles there," said Michael Perschke, CEO of Automobili Pininfarina.</p>

      <p>Pura Vision is intended to showcase Chief Design Officer Luca Borgogno’s new design philosophy for Automobili Pininfarina, pinpointing where historic inspiration and the technology of the future will combine in the company’s forthcoming portfolio of luxury electric cars.</p>
      <p>Borgogno shares that the Pura Vision design drew inspiration from past concepts and models like the 1953 Alfa Romeo 6C 3000 CM Superflow, 1967 Alfa Romeo Duetto Spider, Ferrari Dino 246 GT, and Ferrari 365 GT 2+2. All of which were Pininfarina designs from the past.</p>
      <p>The new Pura Vision will measure about 5000 mm long, 2000 mm wide, and 1600 mm tall. It will come with a revolutionary glass roof that will feature touch functions. The rear shoulders are wide and sexy, akin to sports cars like the 911. The whole side profile also comes with a bottle shape silhouette. It will be fitted with 23 and 24-inch wheels.</p>
      <p>Like luxury yachts, the interior will feature full woodgrain panels for the dashboard with carbon fiber options for those prefer the latter. Seating configuration will be in a standard 2 front and 2 rear, with a plus 1 rear bench option for a fifth passenger.</p>
      <p>Borgogno also shared that they did not call their new concept an SUV because that term is for vehicles like the Navigator or Range Rover. "Our new vehicle although capable of going through rougher roads, is not meant to go off-roading," said Borgogno.</p>
      <p>Their low-roof S-LUV is set to go against the likes of the Bentley Bentayga and Lamborghini Urus, and will have a starting price of about EUR 200,000-220,000 up to around EUR 300,000-320,000 for top-end models.</p>
      <p>The Pura Vision will be powered by a 125kWh battery pack connected to 3 centrally located electric motors, 1 in the front and 2 in the rear to drive the all-wheel-drive system. Performance figures were hinted to start at about 650 horsepower up to a staggering 1,000 horsepower. The battery will be a slim form factor which will only result in a floor height of only 16 centimeters giving occupants a very spacious riding experience. </p>
      <p>“Our strategic collaboration with Bosch and Benteler unlocks the opportunity for growth, through the development of high-performance EV architecture to be deployed by Automobili Pininfarina and potentially other OEM clients. The launch of Battista heralded the arrival of our exciting new brand, and these are the plans that give us a strong platform for future success,” added Perschke.</p>
      <p>Pininfarina says the Pura Vision concept will go into production between 2022 to 2023 and will produce about 1,500 cars a year in its new Italian facility.</p>
