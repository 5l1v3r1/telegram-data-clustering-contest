      <p>The Boden Group and Chemohero have unveiled new offices in Barnstaple.</p>
      <p>The premises were officially opened on Friday, November 8, by former MP Peter Heaton-Jones join Boden Group Managing Director Steve Boden.</p>
      <p>Mr Heaton-Jones also took the opportunity to meet the staff at the office and talk with directors about the growth of Boden Group across the South West over the past decade.</p>
      <p>ChemoHero - a Boden sponsored charity has also expanded with the new offices as a purpose-built office and storage area was created for the charity within the Boden offices to allow their team to create and pack boxes of kindness which are then gifted to chemo patients across North Devon to help them through their treatment.</p>
      <p>Lisa Wallis, founder of ChemoHero, said: “Boden has built a designated unit within their premises which allows us to facilitate the charity. The expansion of ChemoHero would not have been possible without the support of Steve Boden and Boden Group.”</p>
      <p>Since the Boden Group was founded in 2009, it has undergone expansion in the provision of multi-trade building services to commercial, governmental and residential clients. The group is also working with the Ministry of Defence (MOD), health, education, local government and leisure sectors across Southern and South West England while also providing services for large-scale contracts across the UK.</p>
      <p>The group has three core divisions – Boden Facilities Management, Boden Fire &amp; Security and Boden Construction and is the only company in the region to hold supply, installation and maintenance services under one roof. The newly refurbished offices offer all staff a kitchen seating area to have lunches, new storage facilities and increased office space with more desks to cope with their expansion.</p>
      <p>Peter Heaton-Jones, said: “It was a real pleasure to cut the ribbon to open Boden’s impressive new offices and help them celebrate ten successful years in Barnstaple. They are another example of a hidden gem in North Devon’s economy: an important local employer providing a vital service across the region.</p>
      <p>I was particularly interested in the close working relationship between Boden and the Ministry of Defence. It’s a model of how the private sector and government should be working together. Boden is yet another example of a North Devon success story, proving what a great place, we are to work and do business. It was a pleasure to help them celebrate.”</p>
      <p>Steve Boden added: “Our plans going forward are ambitious and we aim to continue our story of success through further growth across the South West and nationwide.”</p>
