      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jose-mourinho-tottenham-manager-spurs-mauricio-pochettino-a9210071.html">Former Manchester United and Chelsea boss Mourinho has been named as the new Spurs head coach</a> following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who won three Premier League titles with Chelsea, had been out of the game since his reign at United ended in bitter fashion last December.</p>
      <p>Souness, the former Liverpool and Newcastle manager, told <i>Sky Sports News</i>: “He is a guy that has won trophies wherever he has been. I would expect him to do the same at Spurs.</p>
      <p>“Spurs have won three trophies in 28 years. For a big club that’s just not good enough.</p>
      <p>“Spurs are genuinely a big football club and they need someone that can turn what is perceived to be attacking, attractive football into maybe a slightly more pragmatic approach that will put some silverware in the boardroom, and I think he is the perfect fit for them.</p>
      <p>“He is an angry man, deep inside. He’s a frustrated man, the way it turned out at United. I think Spurs will reap the benefit of that.</p>
      <p>“He knew he was going to go back and he was just waiting for the right one. He loves the English game.</p>
      <p>“Our football right now is the one everyone wants to watch. The spotlight is on us. He likes to be in the spotlight. He has got a big personality but he truly is a football person.</p>
      <p>“I think Spurs are getting the right man at the right time. He feels he has a point to prove to people who doubted him or were critical of him. He will want to ram those words down his critics’ throats.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino, who had been at Spurs since May 2014, made a big impact at the club and secured top-four Premier League finishes in four successive campaigns and reached last season’s Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Captain Harry Kane tweeted: “Gaffer. I’ll be forever thankful to you for helping me achieve my dreams. We’ve had some amazing moments in the last 5 and a half years that I will never forget. You were my manager but my friend as well and I thank you for that relationship. Good luck with your next chapter!”</p>
      <p>Souness, however, feels the team have failed to kick on and was not surprised by Pochettino’s dismissal.</p>
      <p>The Scot said: “It’s been coming. Mauricio Pochettino appeared to be a man who didn’t want to be at Spurs, which seems very strange. It seemed he was unhappy with something.</p>

      <p>“I’ve never heard anyone say who’s actually responsible for bringing players to Spurs – was it the manager or someone further up the tree?</p>
      <p>“I can only think that is why he was unhappy – someone else is making football decisions.</p>
      <p>“But for whatever reason, and it’s not a recent thing, he’s not wanted to be there. He has been a very unhappy bunny.</p>
      <p>“Their poor form goes back to last year. I think it was 20 games in total they lost. When teams can lose 20 games in a season against some very ordinary opposition and then get to the final of the Champions League, you’d have to say it was a fluke. That camouflaged the real situation at Spurs.”</p>
