      <p>The first track from the film 'Dheeme Dheeme' has already grabbed the number one spot in several music charts, fans are eager to see the millennial trio step into the shoes of Govinda and Raveena iconic song.</p>

The video of the Russian group dancing on the tunes of 'Ankhiyon Se Goli Mare' which came out last year has grabbed everyone's attention now and is going viral on the internet.</p>
