      <h1>Galaxy Note 10 stable Android 10 release may be a few weeks away</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:04:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:04</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>The next <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-note-10/">Galaxy Note 10</a> One UI 2.0 beta update will be released after two weeks, <a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8/%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B810-10-3%EC%B0%A8-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80%EB%8A%94-2%EC%A3%BC-%ED%9B%84-%EC%98%88%EC%A0%95%EC%9E%85%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/2776379">according to one of Samsung’s community moderators</a>. That suggests that the stable Android 10 release for the Note 10 and Note 10+ will not be happening for some time. It also suggests that Samsung may only be able to release Android 10 for the Galaxy S10 series in 2019, or at least make Note 10 owners wait until the very end of the year.</p>
      <p>Of course, this shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. The Galaxy S10’s One UI 2.0 beta program <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s10-android-10-one-ui-2-0-beta-program-is-now-live/">did start two weeks before the Galaxy Note 10’s</a>. And while the Note 10 has only <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-note-10-android-10-beta-update-now-rolling-out/">received two beta builds till now</a>, five beta updates have been released for the Galaxy S10 lineup, with a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s10-another-android-10-beta-update/">difference of just three days</a> between the release of the last two betas. The Galaxy S line has always been updated to the latest version of Android before the Galaxy Notes, and it seems that will be the case this year as well.</p>
      <p>That said, there’s never really a predictable timeline a company can follow when it comes to beta software. Samsung may end up releasing the Galaxy Note 10’s stable Android 10 update much earlier than the beta schedule currently suggests. We would prefer it takes all the time it needs to make sure the stable update is actually stable before pushing it out to customers. After all, Samsung has let serious bugs get <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/latest-galaxy-s10-update-for-us-preventing-access-to-the-phone">through even minor software updates</a>, so it’s better to be late than sorry when it comes to major updates.</p>
