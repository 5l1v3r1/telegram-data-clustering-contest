      <p>A teenage make-up artist said she was left looking like a 'walking Dorito' after an epic fake tan fail.</p>
      <p>Ellena Brice decided to fake tan herself to restore her summer glow after feeling glum that the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> had finally turned cold and dark.</p>
      <p>The-18-year-old took the recommendations of friends and picked up the darkest shade available.</p>
      <p>When she returned home Ellena smothered herself in the tan and left it on for the instructed time before washing it off.</p>
      <p>After looking in the mirror, Ellena was horrified to see that she was left look like a 'walking Dorito' and immediately tried to exfoliate the remaining tan off.</p>
      <p>However, much to her dismay Ellena was left with the tan for two weeks and claims she had to wear darker make-up to cover her epic fail.</p>

      <p>Ellena, from Orpington, Greater London, said: "I have always gone to a professional to get my tan done, but because I was feeling down with the cold and dark weather I decided to do it myself.</p>
      <p>"I was so pale and was going out for a meal so wanted something to make me feel a bit better.</p>
      <p>"So I asked my friends advice of what to get and didn't even think about how the colour would look on me.</p>
      <p>"When I got home I put it all over the place but was shocked with what I saw when I washed the initial layer off.</p>
      <p>"It looked disgusting - it was all in my pores, I had a brown hair upper lip - I was literally a walking Dorito!</p>
      <p>"The worst part was, it took another two weeks for it to completely disappear so I had to wear darker make-up and try not to touch things as I was staining everything.</p>
      <p>"After that incident I've decided not to fake tan ever again - I'm just going to accept an admire my English rose skin so I don't end up looking ridiculous!"</p>

      <p>Despite her best efforts, Ellena claims that she couldn't do anything to get rid of the tan.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was exfoliating my skin until it bleed but then I was starting to look like a loaf of tiger bread my skin started going crusty.</p>
      <p>"It was more annoying because the next day I was going out.</p>
      <p>"I tried everything to cover it up, but had to settle with just using darker make-up.</p>
      <p>"I told everyone about my mishap with the fake tan and then everyone stopped looking at my skin weird.</p>
      <p>"My friends just thought it was funny and typical of me.</p>
      <p>"But my family and my mum's friends reactions were worst as they're older so they were mortified!"</p>
