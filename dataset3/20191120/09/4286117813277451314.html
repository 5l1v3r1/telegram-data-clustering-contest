      <p>Rahul Gandhi says a news report saying over 10,000 Jharkhand adivasis were booked for sedition in a single district between 2017 and 2018, should shock "the conscience of our nation".</p>
      <p>An editor at Scroll.in who reported the story said it was about "possibly <a href="https://scroll.in/article/944116/10000-people-charged-with-sedition-in-one-jharkhand-district-what-does-democracy-mean-here">the largest number of people booked for sedition</a> at one time in one district anywhere in India".</p>
      <p>Citing 19 FIRs registered in Khunti district, her report describes a police crackdown against an adivasi movement called Pathalgadi</p>
      <p>It says over 11,000 people were booked for "a host of offences related to disturbing public order", including under IPC Section 124A, which deals with sedition.</p>
      <p>Those facing sedition charges "constitute two percent of Khuntiâ€™s population," the report adds.</p>
      <p>"The actual number of sedition-accused in the district could, in fact, be higher since it is widely believed that there are more than just 19 FIRs against Pathalgadi supporters."</p>
      <p>In a tweet he posted on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi described the sedition law as "draconian".</p>
      <p>The Congress is bracing for another electoral face-off with the BJP in Jharkhand, which will be held in five phases in November and December.</p>
