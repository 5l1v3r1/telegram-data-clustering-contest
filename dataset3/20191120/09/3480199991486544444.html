      <p>The striker made a £16million switch from AC Milan to Molineux in the summer.</p>
      <p>He is adjusting from living with his family in Pare, in Italy, to life on his own in Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>But Nuno says the 21-year-old, who has netted twice in 19 appearances for his side, is not alone.</p>
      <p>He said: “We try (to help them adapt), we try, we have a department at the club that takes care of whatever they might need.</p>
      <p>“In terms of house and health. The big help in the support they have is from the rest of the squad. The squad is fantastic with all the players that arrive.</p>
      <p>“The newcomers are accepted and I’m sure Patrick has a lot of help from his team-mates.”</p>
      <p>Cutrone returns to England on the back of netting twice from a left wing role in Italy U21s’ 3-0 win over Iceland.</p>
      <p>That Italian performance has given Nuno a fresh option for his current favoured front three for Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>And Cutrone said in an interview with Italian website TMW he is raring to go. He said: “I am in good shape physically and always train to the max. I try to always be ready when called upon, whether it’s to start or off the bench.</p>
      <p>“Both I and the coach (Nuno) know it takes time to settle in and adapt to the Premier League. I am doing that, getting into the philosophy of the team and I get along with everybody.”</p>
      <p>Cutrone’s agent, Donato Orgnoni, rubbished claims of a return to Italy and dismissed links to Serie A side Sampdoria.</p>
      <p>He told Italian website SampNews: “We’ve never thought of leaving Wolves. I don’t understand why certain news comes out.</p>
      <p>“He remains in England one hundred per cent.”</p>
