      <p>Brubaker's Bar on Park Street is set to reopen after extensive renovations this Friday, November 22, just in time for the busy festive season.  </p>
      <p>The popular Dundalk venue closed in May for renovations which include a large toilet block in the basement, a kitchen, and a new courtyard area. </p>
      <p>The bar took to Facebook this week to share images of the bar's fresh new look and to announce the following: “The boarding is down &amp; the lights are up. We open this Friday the 22nd November.”  </p>
