      <h1>New York digs in heels against T-Mobile merger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:26:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#dianagoovaerts" target="_blank">Diana Goovaerts</a></address>
      <p>New York attorney general Letitia James dismissed the idea that recent commitments from T-Mobile US would be enough to <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/t-mobile-turns-another-state-in-merger-battle/">resolve a lawsuit</a> aiming to block the operator’s proposed merger with Sprint.</p>
      <p>James said during a press conference the case against T-Mobile, which is backed by more than a dozen states, centres on perceived antitrust violations.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, we are concerned with anti-competitive behaviour and so providing public benefits are good, but it does not address the antitrust violations.”</p>
      <p>The comments came after T-Mobile <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/t-mobile-unveils-post-merger-5g-play/">pledged to provide free broadband services to schoolchildren and emergency services</a> once its deal with Sprint closes. It also dangled a promise to create up to 1,000 jobs at a new Customer Experience Centre in New York state on the same condition.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere said on Monday (18 November) the offers were “well received” by state attorney generals opposed to the deal.</p>
      <p>He added: “I feel quite good that we have the basis for settling this deal and I feel equally as good if not better on our ability to win this case in a trial.”</p>
      <p>Absent a settlement, the court case will begin 9 December.</p>
