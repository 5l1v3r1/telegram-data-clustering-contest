      <p>Robert Hodgson from the band said: “Highlights included a hauntingly evocative solo performance of Oblivion – Piazzola - by TCB saxophonist Ruth Hunt, and the gloriously rousing combined medley of Lloyd Webber shows with which Take Note and TCB rounded off the evening together.</p>
      <p> “Both groups have developed their styles and offerings hugely over the past few years and to hear them perform together was a real treat that no one present will forget for a long time! It’s particularly reassuring to think that, with so many young musicians and singers on stage, the future of music in Tiverton will be bright for many years to come.”</p>
