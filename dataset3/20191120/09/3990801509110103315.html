      <h1>How humans survived the plague for millenia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:14:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/theconversation/" target="_blank">The Conversation</a></address>
      <p>One of civilization’s most prolific killers shadowed humans for thousands of years without their knowledge.</p>
      <p>The bacteria <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, which causes the plague, is thought to be responsible for up to <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967495-overview">200 million deaths</a> across human history — more than twice the casualties of <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war">World War II</a>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Y. pestis</i> death toll comes from three widespread disease outbreaks, known as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section11.html">epidemics</a>: the sixth century Justinianic Plague that ravaged the Eastern Roman Empire; the 14th century Black Death that killed somewhere between 40 percent and 60 percent of the European population; and the ongoing Third Pandemic, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2015.11.008">began in China</a> in the mid-19th century and currently afflicts <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague">thousands worldwide</a>.</p>
      <p>Scientists long assumed that the deadly disease began infecting humans just before the earliest epidemic, the Justinianic Plague.</p>
      <p>But recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-019-0119-1">paleogenetics research reveals</a> that plague has been with us for millennia longer: Ancient DNA (aDNA) from the bacteria was recovered from human skeletons <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.005">as old as 4,900 years</a>. This means people were contracting and dying from plague at least 3,000 years before there’s any archaeological or historical evidence for an epidemic.</p>
      <p>Why didn’t these earlier infections lead to devastating outbreaks like the Black Death? It seems the answer is part biological — genetic mutations to the bacteria itself — and part cultural — changes to human lifestyles that encouraged the spread of the disease.</p>

      <h3>New proof of ancient plague</h3>
      <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-micro-090817-062436">To identify cases</a> of ancient plague, researchers extract aDNA from a skeleton’s dental pulp chamber and search for genetic code from <i>Y. pestis</i> bacteria. If fossil teeth contain <i>Y. pestis</i> DNA, it’s safe to assume that person died from plague.</p>
      <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.009">Several studies</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.10.025">have found</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04550-9">plague victims</a> who lived nearly 5,000 years ago — more than three millennia before the first known plague epidemic.</p>
      <p>Pathogen aDNA analysis also revealed how <i>Y. pestis</i> bacteria have evolved over time. The oldest genomes recovered belong to a now-extinct lineage, which was missing certain mutations that make plague so contagious for humans. For example, later <i>Y. pestis</i> strains evolved a gene that allows the bacteria to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2014.04.003">efficiently infect fleas</a>, the main carriers of the disease in recent times. More ancient <i>Y. pestis</i> samples lack the gene.</p>
      <p>So far, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04550-9">earliest plague genome</a> recovered with these mutations dates to around 1800 BC from the Samara Valley, Russia. The mutations were also identified in a skeleton from Iron Age Armenia that was dated to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.009">around 950 BC</a>.</p>
      <h3>Missing evidence for epidemics</h3>
      <p>It seems the more contagious form of plague has been infecting humans for nearly 4,000 years.</p>
      <p>But there are no indications in the archaeological record of epidemics in the ancient societies in Russia and Armenia — despite the fact that some individuals died from the highly contagious plague strain.</p>
      <p>It’s possible outbreaks occurred but the evidence simply hasn’t been found yet. For example, if future excavations were to uncover a series of mass graves that differed from the usual burial customs of those cultures, this could suggest societal disruption consistent with an epidemic.</p>

      <p>Or perhaps the bacterial strains, though genetically similar to the plagues of Justinian and the Black Death, lacked some other critical mutation, still unidentified.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, there could be another explanation, related to the behavior of the people being infected. Did the ancient people of the Samara Valley and Armenia live in a way that protected them from plague — perhaps without even knowing it?</p>
      <h3>Investigating plague protections</h3>
      <p>We sought to answer this by investigating whether the populations of 1800s BC Samara Valley and Iron Age Armenia behaved differently from people in Justinian’s Empire in crucial ways.</p>
      <p>First we established conditions that make a population more or less vulnerable to an outbreak. We identified criteria known to be associated with plague virulence, or how infectious the bacterium is.</p>
      <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2013.04.013">Population density</a> is important; the number of people in contact with an infected individual affects the rate of disease spread.</p>

These rodents make ideal hosts for fleas that harbor plague bacteria.</p>
      <p>As East Asia is the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13173/jasiahist.47.1.0001?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">likely geographic source of plague</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-018-1347-0">regular trade</a> with the region is another factor.</p>
      <p>And we examined <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Black-Death/Robert-S-Gottfried/9780029123706">reliance on horses</a>, because some scholars suggest — though it’s not yet biologically tested — that the animals carry natural immunity to plague. Regular contact with horses could reduce a population’s susceptibility to the disease.</p>
      <h3>Comparing cultures point by point</h3>
      <p>We then compared three populations on these six criteria using archaeological and historical data.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>For the Justinianic Plague, we focused on Constantinople, the capital of Justinian’s Empire and an epicenter of the outbreak. Constantinople’s culture created a perfect storm of conditions for an epidemic.</p>
      <p>It was a congested urban center with a population of over 500,000 people, or <a href="https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/arch_pubs/76/">140 individuals per acre</a>. All of Constantinople’s staple foods, including grain, were <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/294333/justinians-flea-by-william-rosen/9780143113812/">shipped from surrounding areas</a> and stored in large warehouses, creating ideal breeding grounds for rodents. Flourishing trade also introduced the rat species — <i>Rattus rattus</i> — <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/294333/justinians-flea-by-william-rosen/">from India</a> that would later be identified as the main carrier of fleas harboring plague.</p>
      <p>In contrast, lifestyles in Samara and Armenia may have kept the epidemic at bay.</p>
      <p>These populations were significantly more mobile and less congested than the urban population of Constantinople. The Samara population shows <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvdjrq7b.7">little evidence for agriculture</a> and tended to occupy small settlements of extended families. These communities managed shared herds, and horse tools found in their characteristic <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature16152">burial mounds</a> suggest the animals were highly valued. Remember, horses may have had some natural immunity to the disease.</p>
      <p>Due to shifting local powers, <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/oip/archaeology-and-geography-ancient-transcaucasian-societies-volume-1">Early Iron Age Armenia</a> appears to have been home to farmers as well as nomadic pastoralists. Generally, though, archaeologists presume the populations practiced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-Armenia-Review-Armen-Khachikyan/dp/9939522940">cattle farming</a>, which would have made people substantially more mobile and dispersed than inhabitants of Constantinople.</p>
      <p>Less congestion would have made contaminating nearby villages more difficult. Lacking agriculture, Samara could not have supported human-dependent rodents, the way Constantinople did. Both populations potentially benefited from a high ratio of horses to people.</p>
      <p>While Samara and Armenia saw occasional plague victims, the structure of their societies likely protected them from the devastation wrought in Constantinople.</p>
      <h3>Cultural perspectives on disease</h3>
      <p>While encouraging economic and technological gains, urban development and trade created ideal conditions for an epidemic in Constantinople. Vulnerability to plague was an unintended consequence of this society’s lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it seems earlier cultures unwittingly shielded themselves from the same threat.</p>
      <p>The harsh reality is that it’s exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to control a pathogen, its possible mutations or its next outbreak. But understanding how human behaviors affect the spread and virulence of a disease can inform preparations for the future.</p>
      <p>As a society, we can take organized measures to reduce the spread of infection, whether by limiting over-congestion, controlling food waste, or restricting access to contaminated areas. Human behaviors are just as critical to our disease susceptibility as are the characteristics of the pathogen itself.</p>
