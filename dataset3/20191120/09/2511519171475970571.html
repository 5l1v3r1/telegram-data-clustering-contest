      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian West</a>‘s make-up artist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mario-dedivanovic">Mario Dedivanovic</a>, who has worked with the reality star for more than a decade, has said he feels “free” after coming out as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gay">gay</a>.</p>
      <p>Dedivanovic, who has seven million followers on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a> and is an ambassador for cosmetics brand <a href="https://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.co.uk/">Anastasia Beverly Hills</a>, received the Artist Achievement Award at the American Influencer Awards in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>After being presented his accolade by Kardashian West, the make-up artist delivered a powerful speech about how he has been “living in fear”.</p>
      <p>He explained that a couple of days prior to the ceremony, he told his mother: “I had spent my entire life and childhood suppressing my thoughts, suppressing my dreams, my feelings, my creativity and trying to be invisible so that no one would know how I’m feeling inside.”</p>
      <p>“I stand here for the first time in my life a proud 37-year-old gay man,” Dedivanovic stated on stage. “I finally feel that bright light that I’ve been dreaming of my whole life is pouring from my soul around my body and it’s mine.”</p>

      <p>The make-up artist told the awards ceremony audience that his mother urged him ”never again to live in shame or fear”, a message that he hopes to pass onto younger generations.</p>
      <p>“Little boys and girls around the world are growing up with pain and fear like I did,” Dedivanovic said, revealing that he has in the past considered taking his own life.</p>
      <p>“Because they are different and they are scared to be themselves, because their culture or their family judged them.”</p>
      <p>Dedivanovic <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B5DvxX9F328/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">shared</a> footage from his speech on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a>, stating in the caption that he feels ”finally free”.</p>
      <p>Several of his followers praised him for speaking publicly for the first time about his sexual identity.</p>
      <p>“Congrats Mario!!! You’ve inspired so many and will now inspire soooo many more,” wrote YouTuber Gigi Gorgeous.</p>
      <p>“What a gift from the soul this was! Congrats to you on the wonderful award but mostly for taking the opportunity to use what could have easily been a superficial moment to show the world what true character and vulnerability looks like!” commented make-up artist Rachel Goodwin.</p>
      <p>Following Dedivanovic’s speech, Kardashian West spoke on stage about how he is one of her “best friends”, saying: “He’s created some of my most magical memories and really I believe made me who I am today.”</p>
