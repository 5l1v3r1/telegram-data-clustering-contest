        <b>If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift for someone who's feeling homesick for Ireland, or if you're feeling a little homesick yourself, these <a href="https://craicpack.ie/?utm_source=irish-central-article">Irish care packages</a> offer instant comfort and joy. </b>
      </p>
      <p>There's something about the holidays that can make you especially wistful for the comforts of home. For Irish people, that includes an array of Cadbury's chocolates, Tayto crisps, Barry's or Lyon's tea, Butlers drinking chocolate, McVitie's biscuits, Christmas pudding, and some Lucozade for when your stomach needs a little break from all the indulgence.  </p>
      <p>Irish care package company <a href="https://craicpack.ie/?utm_source=irish-central-article">CraicPack has launched two new baskets</a> with all the festive items for family, friends, and loved ones who can’t make it home for the holidays. They contain all of the delicious little things that add up to make a real Irish Christmas. </p>
      <p><a href="https://craicpack.ie/order/advent-box-christmas-hamper/?utm_source=irish-central-article">The Advent Box</a> contains Irish goodies for the Christmas countdown. It includes a Cadbury Advent Calendar, mince pies, limited edition Cadbury chocolates, and, of course, that crucial Lucozade to get you through all the Christmas parties over the next two months.</p>
