      <p>KOLKATA: Run-machine <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> - the most successful Indian Test captain - is certainly missing his 'partner in crime'.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture on social media with former skipper MS Dhoni, Kohli said: "Partners in crime...Crime: stealing doubles from fielders at the boundary. Guess who".</p>

      <p>Soon after the post, fans started pouring in their guess claiming it to be the former captain.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Tuesday, India and Bangladesh players stayed indoors after landing here, and India head coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ravi-Shastri">Ravi Shastri</a> had to change his initial plan of dropping by due to a delayed flight.</p>
      <p>But the buzz at Eden Gardens, which will host the second Test, was unmistakable on Tuesday as preparations were in full swing two days ahead of the first-ever Day-Night Test here.</p>
      <p>Skipper Kohli and vice-captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajinkya-Rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a> were the first to reach on Tuesday morning with the team following later in the afternoon. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammed-shami">Mohammed Shami</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> also joined the team.</p>
      <p>The historic match will kick-off with Army paratroopers expected to parachute into Eden to hand over a pink ball each to the two captains just before the toss.</p>
      <p>This will be followed by the ringing of the Eden Bell by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.</p>
