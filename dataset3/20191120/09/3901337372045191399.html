      <p>The Egyptian U23 side were awarded a penalty in the 59<sup>th</sup> minute, an incident that raised many eyebrows, with head coach Notoane revealing that ‘it was outside the box’.</p>
      <p>“You saw what happened in the 60<sup>th</sup> minute, a penalty? Okay, I had a look at it and we all saw it, nothing to do with Egypt, someone mentioned VAR, why don’t we bring VAR, but it has nothing to do with Egypt. I have it here on my phone, it is outside the box but I don’t want to spoil the occasion for Egypt,” he told the media after the game.</p>
      <p>“So of course, 80<sup>th</sup> minute, look a foul on my player on the white line, okay we get nothing, it is okay, we take it, it is football. </p>
      <p>“Going 1-0 down, chasing the game, contain them and then they take the game to the 90<sup>th</sup> minute, but we were open, we made silly mistakes and you could see the boys emotionally couldn’t handle the penalty decision to be honest.”  </p>
