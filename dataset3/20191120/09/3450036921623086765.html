      <h1>Bill seeking end to animal testing for cosmetics introduced in US Congress</h1>

      <p>A bill aiming to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2886/committees">end the use of animal testing for cosmetics</a> and the sale of cosmetics tested on animals has been submitted in the U.S. House and Senate.</p>
      <p>The Humane Cosmetics Act is championed by groups including the <a href="https://secure.humanesociety.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=7653&amp;s_src=web_maincta_ecat">Humane Society of the United States </a>and the Personal Care Products Council. The bill will ban animal testing in the cosmetic industry and create alternative approaches to cosmetic safety assessments.</p>
      <p>The bill is supported by legislators on both sides of the aisle. A joint statement by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society Legislative Fund, and Personal Care Products Council praises senators Martha McSally, R-Ariz., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. for their efforts.</p>
      <p>â€œWe applaud these senators for driving this important bipartisan effort to introduce the Humane Cosmetics Act. This consensus among diverse stakeholders was essential, and enactment of this legislation is critically important to ensure a uniform standard for animal welfare while continuing to support the development of safe and innovative cosmetics and personal care products," the joint release states.</p>
      <p>The bill was introduced in the Senate on Monday and will go to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.</p>
