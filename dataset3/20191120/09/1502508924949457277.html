      <p>Law Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ravi-shankar-prasad">Ravi Shankar Prasad </a>on Wednesday appealed to chief justices of high courts to take pro-active measures to dispose of cases pending for ten years or more and said the government has taken a series of steps to improve people's access to justice.</p>
      <p>Responding to a query of BSP member Danish Ali in Lok Sabha for the creation of a bench of Allahabad <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/high-court">High Court </a>in western Uttar Pradesh, Prasad said that the government can move ahead in the matter once there is a recommendation from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/high-court">high court </a>and appropriate approvals from the state government.</p>
      <p>"That has not happened. Once it happens, we will take it forward," he said.</p>
      <p>Prasad said he has been urging the high courts to expedite cases that are more than 10 years old.</p>
      <p>He urged chief justices of all high courts to take "proactive measures" to dispose of such cases.</p>
      <p>Answering a query on undertrials, he said that bail should be granted in petty cases.</p>
      <p>The minister said that the government has expedited the process of appointment of judges.</p>
