      <h1>Spins and Thrills Ahead for Liverpool FC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:45:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/tomsimmons/" target="_blank">Tom Simmons</a></address>
      <p>The past couple of seasons have seen plenty of success for Liverpool Football Club. The Champions League trophy is back at Anfield after that great win over <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50483023">Tottenham</a>. This season is going even better with a big lead at the top of the Premier League. Now there’s a slot machine dedicated to the football club!</p>
      <p>From December 11, you’ll be able to spin the reels of the Liverpool slot machine. Hopefully your luck will be in and you’ll become a winner just like Jurgen <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/20/fuel-to-the-klopp-guardiola-fight-fans-react-differently-to-mourinho-spurs-appointment/">Klopp’s</a> team. The slot has been produced by Aspect Gaming. They’ve been responsible for successful games such as ‘Lotus Lantern,’ ‘Love Story’ and ‘Typhoon Cash.</p>
      <p>The game has five reels and four rows of symbols. Several of the symbols are Liverpool FC related. For example, there’s an image of Anfield, the club logo, the famous Shankly Gates, a ‘This is Anfield’ scarf and players including Nathaniel Clyne and Jordan Henderson. It’s got 50 betways and you will be able to play the game on your desktop, tablet or mobile. </p>
      <p>The maximum win you can get is 100,000 coins and it can be played from as little as 50p. There are free spins, wild and scatter symbols and apparently the game has two colours – red and green. Now I wonder, which one will be the most popular choice.</p>
      <p>With the club having <a href="https://slotcatalog.com/en/slots/Liverpool-Football-Club-Slots">their own Liverpool Slot</a> it’s a sure sign they are becoming even more popular. That’s perhaps inevitable after the recent success the club has been achieving. The slot game is out next month, and December is already looking to be a massive month for the club.</p>
      <p>Their eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League could be even larger by then. Liverpool have five more Premier League games to play in the next three weeks, not to forget the final two games in their Champions League group. That includes the mouth-watering clash with Napoli at Anfield on 27 November.</p>
      <p>Three of those Premier League games are at home. December begins with a midweek match at Anfield against local rivals Everton. The hectic month continues with two more league games away at Bournemouth and home to Watford. Then the cup competitions take centre stage for Liverpool starting with the Carabao Cup quarter final away to Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Manchester City successfully completed the domestic treble last season, could it be Liverpool’s turn this time around? It’ll be a tough game though as Liverpool are in danger of becoming a victim of their own success. </p>
      <p>The Carabao Cup tie is being played on December 17 (six days after the release of the slot game), which just happens to be the day before Liverpool play in the World Club Championship, more of which in a moment. </p>
      <p>The Villa match will be a test of the strength of Liverpool’s squad for sure. That’s because two squads are going to be playing that week due to that World Club Championship game. Liverpool’s best players can be playing the new slot game while on their way to Qatar.</p>
      <p>They may appreciate some hot weather in December as they bid to win another tournament. The championship takes place between 11 and 21 December. Liverpool have already won the European title and the European Super Cup, so what better way to end the year by becoming World Club Champions.</p>
      <p>The Reds don’t play their first game until the 18th, that will give them plenty of time to play the new slot game. They are due to play the winners of the second-round clash between Monterrey from Mexico and the victors from the first-round match between Al Sadd from Iraq and Hieghene Sport from New Caledonia.</p>
      <p>If Liverpool can win that semi-final, then just four days before Christmas Day, they’ll be in the final. Possible opponents include River Plate (Argentina), Flamengo (Brazil), Esperance de Tunis (Tunisia), Urawa Red Diamonds (Japan) or Al-Hilal (Saudi Arabia) If they lose their semi-final then they will be in the third and fourth place play-off.</p>
      <p>After their World Club Championship exploits, there’s a bit of time to celebrate Christmas (though not indulging in too much of the turkey and mince pies and no to that extra roastie) and carry on playing that slot game.</p>
      <p>They return to Premier League action on Boxing Day with a trip to Leicester City. That’s a fixture that won’t be an easy one after City nearly grabbed a point at Anfield earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>Their final fixture of an amazing 2019 sees them host Wolverhampton Wanders on 29 December. Another important game and hopefully the chance to complete another calendar year without losing a home Premier League game at Anfield. Who could have imagined that when suffering a home Premier League defeat by Crystal Palace on 23 April 2017, Liverpool would get all the way to November 2019 without losing another one?</p>
      <p>Liverpool haven’t been this successful in years and 2020 could be an even more exciting year for them. They look certain to enter the new year (and decade) top of the Premier League and probably reigning World and European Champions. Becoming English champions is the dream though. </p>
      <p>Liverpool fans haven’t been able to celebrate that since the 1989/90 season. What a way to celebrate a 30th anniversary! It must be in the stars as Liverpool were also League One Champions in the 1979/80 season. Could 2020 be another new decade that sees its title winner be Liverpool?</p>
      <p>There are plenty of dreams that could be fulfilled by Liverpool in the coming months. Going through an entire Premier League season unbeaten would be as thrilling as winning the top prize in the new slot game.</p>
      <p>Liverpool haven’t lost a league game yet and their current record is out of this world. At the time of writing this article, they have lost just one of their last 51 Premier League games and an unbeaten run of 29 since that loss to Manchester City on 3 January 2019. They have just eight league games to remain unbeaten in to reach a whole calendar year without a Premier League defeat.</p>
      <p>It’s going to be a hectic schedule for Liverpool but one that promises an extra-special 2020. All those top games to look forward to and the chance to win some great prizes when playing the Liverpool FC slot game. Bring it on.</p>
