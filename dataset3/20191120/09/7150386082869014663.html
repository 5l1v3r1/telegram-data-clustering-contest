      <p><b>San Francisco:</b> <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/apple-airpods/">Apple AirPods</a> boast of great sound quality, however, if they do fall out, they are going to be a massive pain to find due to their small size. And not to forget, they are damn expensive too, so losing them is sure to ruin someone’s day.</p>
      <p>Playing with the same worry and fear, an artist is now pranking the people of San Francisco, California by placing about 20 life-size AirPod stickers on the streets, trains and other places around the city.</p>
      <p>The prankster Pablo Rochat told <i>Mashable,</i> “I see people with AirPods all the time in San Francisco. I got a pair myself recently, and they’re an awkward shape so I drop them occasionally. I see my friends drop them, too. I thought it would be funny just to pretend like everyone’s dropping them.”</p>
      <p>For making the stickers, Rochat used some high-resolution AirPod images, a printer, and some sticker paper. Rochat then tweeted pictures and video documenting the whole process:</p>

      <p>Rochat said some people definitely found the prank funny while others became annoyed and confused after realizing they were just stickers. He also posted a video of how the prank really unfolded with some people falling for it:</p>

      <p>Twitter users had a field day laughing at the prank and hailed Rochat for his creativity while some even berated him for coming up with such a mean prank</p>

      <p>Rochat later also invited people to join in the fun and posted<a href="http://pablorochat.com/freebies"> a free template on his website</a> for fellow pranksters to print out their own AirPod stickers.</p>
      <p>Apple’s AirPod are small white earbuds that start at $159 for the pair.</p>
