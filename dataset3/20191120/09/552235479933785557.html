      <p>Depraved Wilson, 58, of George Street, Ayr, used the mobile messaging app, Kik , to send repeated communications, which were of an incident and sexual nature, to the girl, called ‘Abbey.’</p>
      <p>But the messages were, in fact, received by an undercover law enforcement officer, leading to Wilson’s arrest.</p>
      <p>Wilson appeared on indictment at Ayr Sheriff Court on Tuesday, November 12 and admitted two charges.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to repeatedly sending indecent communications to a child he believed was 13 via Kik Messenger, messages that were of an incident and sexual nature.</p>
      <p>The offence took place between August 20 and August 23 last year, both dates inclusive, at a property in Lochlea Avenue, Troon.</p>
      <p>Devious Wilson further admitted a breach of his bail conditions, set out by the court on August 24 last year which prohibited him from installing, or using software called CCleaner to permanently remove files, on a device used by him.</p>
      <p>Wilson was found to have broken the terms of his bail in George Street on January 11 this year.</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned until November 28 in order for Sheriff Scott Pattison to deal with the matter.</p>
      <p>Wilson’s bail was continued.</p>
