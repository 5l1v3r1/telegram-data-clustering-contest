      <p>There is only one place to visit if you want to see the Coca-Cola Truck's Christmas tour in the North East.</p>
      <p>The iconic truck, famous for its appearances in Coke's 'Holidays are Coming' adverts, makes annual appearances around Britain in the run-up to Christmas. This year there is only one North East stop on the Coca Cola Christmas tour and it's not Newcastle, Sunderland or Durham, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coca-cola-christmas-truck-tour-20864647">Mirror Online reports</a> .</p>
      <p>This year, the Coca-Cola Christmas truck will call at Asda in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/boldon">Boldon Colliery</a> on Thursday November 21, along with 18 other locations around the UK.</p>
      <p>Queues for entry will open at midday, with last entry at 7pm.</p>
      <p>This year, for the first time, Coca-Cola has also partnered with Crisis - the national charity for homelessness. Coca-Cola has pledged to donate 10p for each can recycled by visitors at the truck tour.</p>

      <p>Kris Robbens, Marketing Director at Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland, said: "Christmas is all about sharing special moments with friends and loved ones and we’re looking forward to spreading the festive cheer across Great Britain again this year with our iconic Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour.</p>
      <p>"Whilst Christmas is a moment of celebration, it’s also incredibly important to remember those that need support throughout the season."</p>
      <p>"So, we’re really pleased to partner with Crisis and whilst guests at the tour enjoy a refreshing Coca-Cola zero sugar, when they recycle their can, they’ll be helping to support an amazing charity."</p>
      <p>Jon Sparkes, Chief Executive at Crisis, added: "Everyone in our society  should have a safe and secure home.</p>
      <p>"But right now, many people are denied this basic human need. None of us should be facing the prospect of a Christmas without a home.</p>
      <p>"We know that ending homelessness is absolutely possible.</p>
      <p>"We’re delighted to be working with Coca-Cola throughout its iconic Christmas Truck Tour and receiving a donation that will help us to continue to be there for the people that need us, both at Christmas and all year round."</p>
