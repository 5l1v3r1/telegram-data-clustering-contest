      <p>Most famous faces who enter the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/im-celebrity-roman-kemps-confusion-17283316">I'm A Celebrity...</a> jungle can normally expect to lose a few pounds during the course of their stay.</p>
      <p>But, while food rations in camp are usually quite sparse, the contestants can at least expect to go home with their wallets bulging. And that's especially true of this year's crop of hopefuls as the hit ITV show enters its 19th series, with sizeable amounts of cash being paid out to those participating.</p>
      <p>Indeed, like the tasks set before the celebs in the regular Bushtucker Trails, some of the amounts are eye-watering. Take American television personality <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/odds-slashed-caitlyn-jenner-winning-17273383">Caitlyn Jenner</a> , for example.</p>
      <p>She's said to be earning around £500,000 – one of the highest figures a contestant has ever been paid (though it is said to be matched by the sky high sum awarded to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/harry-redknapp-noel-edmonds-eat-15460116">Noel Edmonds</a> the previous year).</p>

      <p>Close behind Jenner is ex-footballer-turned-sports pundit Ian Wright, who's reportedly netting £400,000, while Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle is taking home £250,000.</p>
      <p>Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway and former EastEnders acrtress Jacqueline Jossa are apparently making £75,000 each, with £50k going to both DJ Adele Roberts and retired England rugby player James Haskell.</p>

      <p>Capital FM DJ Roman Kemp is on £40,000 and X Factor winner Myles Stephenson gets £25,000.</p>
      <p>Stand-up comic Andrew Maxwell's take home pay is unknown, although it's unlikely to be a laughing matter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it's thought Coronation Street star Andrew 'Kirk' Whyment will be entering the jungle later this week, thereby pocketing £100k for his trouble.</p>
      <p>I'm a Celebrity hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly said: “Most people come into the jungle to lose a few pounds, but [Caitlyn’s] going to be gaining 500,000 of them according to the papers.”</p>
