      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-by-tottenham-after-early-season-struggles"><b>Pochettino was sacked by Spurs on Tuesday evening</b></a> following a poor start to the season which sees the club sit 14th in the Premier League, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/jose-mourinho-explains-tottenham-ambitions-after-succeeding-pochettino-on-big-money-deal"><b>with Jose Mourinho brought in to replace him</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Kane was given his debut by Tim Sherwood in 2014, but it is Pochettino who can be given huge credit for helping Kane progress in the last five years, and writing in a post on Twitter, the England captain issued his response to the news that the Argentine had left.</p>
      <p>“Gaffer. I’ll be forever thankful to you for helping me achieve my dreams,” Kane wrote. “We’ve had some amazing moments in the last 5 and a half years that I will never forget.</p>
      <p>“You were my manager but my friend as well and I thank you for that relationship. Good luck with your next chapter!”</p>
