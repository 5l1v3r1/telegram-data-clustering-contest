        <b>Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed Jose Mourinho is their new head coach on a three-year deal after the shock sacking of Mauricio Pochettino last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tottenham have confirmed Jose Mourinho will take charge in north London following <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/sport/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-343661"><i>Mauricio Pochettino's dismissal</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has signed a contract until the end of the 2022/23 season.</p>
      <p>Spurs sensationally sacked Pochettino yesterday after a series of poor results.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old had guided Spurs to the Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>But they underwhelmed in the Madrid showpiece and lost 2-0 to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who was axed by Manchester United 12 months ago, has now been tasked with reviving the club's fortunes.</p>
      <p>“In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician," Daniel Levy said.</p>

      <p>"He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Having been given the nod, Mourinho explained that he's delighted to take charge.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," he said.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho's first game will be against West Ham at the London Stadium in east London on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Spurs have not won an away fixture since January.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese is one of the most decorated coaches in world football - although he struggled at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old won league titles with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>He is also one of only three managers to have bagged the Champions League twice with two clubs.</p>
      <p>Mourinho won Europe’s elite competition with Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan six years later in 2010.</p>
