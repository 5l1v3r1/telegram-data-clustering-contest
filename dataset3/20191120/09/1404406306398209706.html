      <h1>Lawmakers Set to Vote in Congress to Federally Legalize Marijuana</h1>

      <p>Congress is set to vote this week to removing cannabis from the confines of the Controlled Substances Act, which will decriminalize it at the federal level and enable states to set their policies. The House Judiciary Committee will debate bill HR 3884, called the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act as early as Wednesday (November 20), or shortly thereafter. </p>
      <p>The MORE Act, co-sponsored by Sen. Kamala Harris and House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, will also allow people with low-level cannabis convictions the opportunity to have their records cleared. Communities that were impacted by the failed "war on drugs" will also be given grants and funding, while doctors at VA facilities will be able to recommend cannabis to veterans suffering from PTSD, pain management and anxiety. The proposal currently has 55 co-sponsors and while some believe that it will receive a fair shot from Congress, while others are skeptical of the Senate passing the bill. </p>
