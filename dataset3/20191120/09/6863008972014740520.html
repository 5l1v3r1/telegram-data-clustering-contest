      <p>Oil prices slipped for a third day on Wednesday as a surge in U.S. stockpiles reinforced concerns about lackluster global economic growth, while hopes ebbed for any movement on the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
      <p>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 erased early gains to be down 6 cents, or 0.1%, at $55.15 a barrel by 0631 GMT, after falling more than 4% over the previous two sessions, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-extend-losses-on-supply-trade-war-fears-idUSKBN1XU0A6">Reuters said</a>.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $60.71 a barrel, down 20 cents, or 0.3%. Brent dropped 3.8% during the prior two sessions.</p>
      <p>Crude inventories in the United States, the world's biggest oil user, rose 6 million barrels in the week to NovemberÂ 15 to 445.9 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The increase added to concerns about crude oversupply after Reuters reported that Russia, the world's second-biggest producer, was unlikely to back deepening output cuts when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets in Vienna on December 5-6.</p>
      <p>Russia and other oil producers have agreed with OPEC to cut 1.2 million barrels per day of output through March to bolster prices, a producer group known as OPEC+.</p>
      <p>Official U.S. government inventory data from the Energy Information Administration is due at 10:30 a.m. EST on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude demand has slowed during a protracted trade war with China. Hopes for an end to the dispute in the signing of a so-called Phase 1 agreement between the sides has dimmed amid disagreements over the removal of tariffs.</p>
