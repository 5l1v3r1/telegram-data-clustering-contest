      <p>Green-fingered Barclays staff have spent time gardening and clearing up at Barnstaple station.</p>
      <p>Volunteers from local Barnstaple, Bideford and Tiverton branches, joined forces with the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership to weed the planters on the station as well as adding in some winter colour in the form of pansies and cyclamens on Wednesday, November 6.</p>
      <p>The day at Barnstaple was not the only action on the line during that week as staff from Great Western Railway, and Network Rail spruced up several stations along the line while it was closed for engineering works.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Catterall from the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership said: “We had a great day at Barnstaple with 11 keen volunteers from Barclays working hard to transform the planters by not only removing weeds but adding in some colourful plants to cheer up the winter days for passengers using the station.”</p>
      <p>Jo Pollard, Manager at Barclays Tiverton branch, added: “We are delighted to support the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership and would like to thank everyone who helped us to make this happen.</p>
      <p>“Barclays encourages employees to get involved in the causes we care about. It’s about giving back our skills, time and energy to support our local communities – so we’re thrilled to have supported this project.”</p>
      <p>Melanie Harvey from Great Western Railway said: “Our community rail partners play a vital role, adding value to a wide range of projects designed to improve services and make stations safer, friendlier and greener. I am incredibly grateful to the staff of our local Barclays for giving up their time so freely.”</p>
      <p>The Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership works to promote the six rural branch lines in two counties and is a non-profit partnership between local authorities, including Devon County Council, Cornwall Council, Plymouth City Council, Plymouth University and Great Western Railway.</p>
