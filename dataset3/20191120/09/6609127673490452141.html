      <p>We told earlier how devastated family members <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4970522/jonathon-donaldson-river-almond-west-lothian/">paid tribute to the popular chef</a> who was "the life of the party".</p>
      <p>And his thoughtful cousin Becca Graham, 16, has organised a fundraiser in a bid to raise much needed funds to support the family with funeral costs.</p>
      <p>She told the Scottish Sun: "I just wanted to help support the family.</p>
      <p>"He was a great person, he was just so caring, even to people he didn't know - he would always make sure you were OK.</p>
      <p>"He was really popular, he worked in a lot of places and got to know a lot of people."</p>

      <p>Becca said she has been touched by the response to Jonathon's shock death, and also to her fundraiser.</p>
      <p>She added: "It made me feel really proud and it's so good that it's going to help.</p>
      <p>"It's a small comfort to the family.</p>
      <p>"Originally I just wanted to raise £200 but it's at £300 and people are still donating.</p>
      <p>"So I'm just going to keep it going until we need to pay for the funeral."</p>
      <p>She added on the gofundme page: "His death was such a surprise to all of us and will be a hard one to recover from, he will never be forgotten.</p>
      <p>"Any donations are useful, thank you all."</p>
