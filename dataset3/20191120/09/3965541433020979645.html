      <p>Knapp passed away earlier this month after being struck by a truck while crossing the street.</p>
      <p>His family released the following statement shortly after the incident:</p>
      <p>"Michael was a family man that touched many and will be sorely missed. He offered so much to his family, friends and community. Thank you for allowing us this private time to cherish his memories and life."</p>
      <p>Knapp joined the Lynden Police Department this past summer after an extensive career in police and FBI work, including an 8-month stint with the Blaine Police Department.</p>
      <p>"Very humble man. For all the experience he had, just a very humble man," said Gary Vis, Executive Director of the Lynden Chamber of Commerce. "So, it was sad. Without a doubt - it was sad."</p>
      <p>Vis says Knapp was one of the best men he’s ever met.</p>
      <p>"The man had an impact," Vis said. "He was helping our community, and we’re gonna pray for him and his family, and even for the person that was involved that was driving. It’s one of those unfortunate accidents."</p>
