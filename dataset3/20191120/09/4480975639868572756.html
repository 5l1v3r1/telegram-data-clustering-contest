      <h1>NZD/USD Technical Analysis: Finds some support near 0.6400 handle, descending trend-line breakpoint</h1>

      <p>The NZD/USD pair failed to capitalize on the previous session's goodish intraday positive move to over two-week tops and once again started retreating from 100-day SMA barrier on Wednesday.<br/> <br/>The pullback dragged the pair below 23.6% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the 0.6324-0.6437 recent upsurge, albeit bulls showed some resilience near a one-week-old descending trend-line <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> breakpoint.<br/> <br/>The mentioned resistance-turned-support is closely followed by 100-hour SMA, which should now act as a key pivotal point for intraday traders ahead of the release of the latest <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> meeting minutes.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on hourly/daily charts have still managed to hold in the bullish territory and continue to support prospects for the emergence of some dip-buying interest at lower levels.<br/> <br/>Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a sustained weakness below 100-hour SMA support, currently near the 0.6400 handle, before confirming that the recent bounce might have run out of the steam.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, bulls are likely to wait for a sustained move beyond 100-day SMA, around the 0.6435 region, above which the pair is likely to aim towards monthly swing highs near the 0.6465 region.<br/> <br/>Some follow-through buying has the potential to continue lifting the pair further towards reclaiming the key 0.6500 psychological mark en-route the very important 200-day SMA barrier.</p>
