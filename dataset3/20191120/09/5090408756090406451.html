        <li>A mile-long road in London has been the city’s Billionaires Row since World War II: the capital’s destination for luxury, scandal, murder, and secrecy.</li>
        <li>Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal scooped up the Summer Palace in 1996 with cash from his 38% share in ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, of which he is also CEO.</li>
        <li>The Summer Palace has 12 bathrooms, six reception rooms, and a basement with a swimming pool, jacuzzi and steam room, accessed by a glass elevator.</li>

      <p>Lakshmi Mittal was named as the UK’s fifth-richest man in 2018, with a net worth of nearly £16 billion ($20.5 billion) accrued from his role as CEO of ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker.</p>
      <p>And one of the ways he put his wealth to use was acquiring a 25,000 sq-ft, 11-bedroom mansion on The Bishops Avenue – London’s Billionaires Row.</p>
      <p>He bought the lavish home, nicknamed Summer Palace, in 1996 for £7 million ($11 million.)</p>
      <p>It has 12 bathrooms and six reception rooms. Its basement features a swimming pool, Jacuzzi and steam room, all accessed by a glass elevator.</p>

      <p>It has two staff apartments on its first floor, each of which have three bedrooms of their own.</p>
      <p>When Mittal wanted to sell in the early 2000s he struggled to find a buyer <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/mittal-rents-out-10000-a-week-palace-he-cant-sell-6713654.html">and spent several years renting it out at £10,000 ($16,000) a week</a>.</p>
      <p>Mittal had reportedly decided to sell his Summer Palace because Barnet Council, the local authority, had granted permission to redevelop a neighboring mansion into luxury apartments which would overlook his garden.</p>

      <p>While Mittal was trying to shift the Summer Palace in 2004, he bought Formula 1 founder Bernie Ecclestone’s £57 million ($105 million) 15-bedroom townhouse on Kensington Palace Gardens, a street just west of central London known for housing embassies.</p>
      <p>The same year, Mittal splashed £30 million ($55 million) on his <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1463397/30m-wedding-bill-as-Bollywood-comes-to-France.html">23-year-old daughter’s 2004 wedding</a>, booking out the 17th-century Vaux le Vicomte palace a few miles south of Paris.</p>

      <p>On July 6, 2011, the Summer Palace was finally sold for £36 million ($57 million) to an unnamed eastern European oligarch.</p>

      <p>The official owners, Kerner Limited, immediately <a href="https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/files/51EACABD1BAB718AE672E811E9B9E368/pdf/F_04125_11-00000023.pdf-375220.pdf">filed planning permission t</a>o add a second basement with a relaxation area for staff, new storage space, and a security control room to monitor CCTV cameras.</p>
      <p>As with many of the homes on The Bishops Avenue, the owner is a company registered in a tax haven.</p>
      <p>In this case Kerner Limited are based in Jersey, which has no capital gains tax, a low goods tax, and low stamp duty.</p>
