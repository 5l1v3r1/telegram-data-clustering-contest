      <h1>Granit Xhaka set for Arsenal exit as two clubs 'eye January loan transfer'</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka's future at Arsenal is in plenty of doubt with both Inter Milan and AC Milan interest in the Swiss midfielder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:46:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka is eyeing a loan move away from Arsenal come January with Italy his likely destination.</p>
      <p>Inter Milan and AC Milan are both interested in the Swiss midfielder whose future at the Gunners is up in the air.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has also been linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> should he look to stay in England with Fabian Schar, his team-mate at international level, seen as a major player in convincing his compatriot to head north.</p>
      <p>The midfielder hit back at fans when he was substituted against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month which has caused a huge divide between them and the player.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old has not played since his public outburst and he is seeking a way out, but a move back to Borussia Monchengladbach has been ruled out.</p>
      <p>It leaves the two Milan clubs in pole position to secure the midfielder's signature until the end of the season with an option to make the deal permanent, reports <a href="https://sport.sky.de/fussball/artikel/transfer-update/10861226/33895">Sky</a> .</p>
      <p>And Unai Emery has been unable to confirm whether the former skipper will play for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> again should he stay put.</p>

      <p>“As a coach I have a responsibility for the team: we need a player like Xhaka. But also, I don’t know if he’s going to play [for us] again," Emery said after the incident.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has endured a difficult relationship with the Arsenal fans since joining after Euro 2016 and issued a public statement after his outburst citing mass abuse suffered on social media as the reason behind his emotions boiling over.</p>
      <p>His appointment as captain earlier this season was met with plenty of criticism.</p>
      <p>The Swiss star won a vote to be given the armband, but Emery's reluctance to name him without seeking the approval of the players angered Xhaka.</p>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has since been given the armband at the Emirates.</p>
