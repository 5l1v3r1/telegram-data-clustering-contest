      <h1>Shinzo Abe mired in cherry blossom party scandal as he becomes longest-serving Japanese prime minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:44:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/danielle-demetriou/" target="_blank">Danielle Demetriou</a></address>
      <p>Celebrations to mark Shinzo Abe becoming the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history were marred by a growing scandal surrounding the government's annual cherry blossom party.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday Mr Abe, 65, had spent 2,887 days in office during two stints as prime minister, beating a record set by Taro Katsura more than a century ago.</p>
      <p>But the milestone was overshadowed by accusations Mr Abe turned a state-funded flower-viewing party into an election campaign event by handing out invitations to his supporters.</p>
      <p>Admitting his role in selecting guests for the first time, he said: “I should deeply reflect on how it was managed."</p>
      <p>The cherry blossom party, which first took place in 1952, is held every year at a park in Tokyo to honour people such as athletes and celebrities for their accomplishments.</p>

      <p>Mr Abe has become something of an expert at weathering scandals during his two stints as premier, the first of which was a single term in 2007, followed by his return to power in December 2012.</p>
      <p>Since then, the PM has led his ruling coalition to six national election victories, with his party’s longevity aided in part by a fragmented opposition.</p>
      <p>In the process, he has survived a string of scandals ranging from allegations of cronyism to falsified data, with two ministers – appointed in a September cabinet reshuffle – recently resigning over allegations of election campaign law violations.</p>
      <p>Mr Abe’s track record for diplomacy has been more positive, with the global media spotlight soaking up his warm friendship with US president Donald Trump, although bilateral tensions with South Korea continue to soar.</p>
      <p>An uncertain economic outlook also clouds Abe’s remaining time in power, with exports tumbling at their fastest pace in three years in October, due to weakening demand from the US and China.</p>
      <p>Marking the milestone on Wednesday, Mr Abe promised to push forward with plans for a stronger military and a revamped economy during his remaining time as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, a term which ends in September 2021.</p>
      <p>He also highlighted his long-cherished but controversial dream of revising Japan’s post-war pacifist constitution and vowed to tackle the nation’s demographic challenges of falling birth rates and a fast aging population.</p>
      <p>“I want to tackle policy issues with my heart and soul, with a sense of treading on thin ice and staying on my toes, not forgetting the spirit with which I began,” Mr Abe told reporters.</p>
