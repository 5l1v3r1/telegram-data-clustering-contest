      <p>Fashion delivery player Clipper saw its shares soar in early trading after confirming a takeover approach from a private equity giant.</p>
      <p>Steve Parkin, who founded Clipper in 1992 before taking it public in 2014, is reportedly plotting a £300m offer for the firm alongside US private equity giant Sun Capital Partners.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The expected take-private bid, first reported last night by Sky News, sent Clipper’s share price up almost 22 per cent to 294.5p in early trading.</p>
      <p>However, neither party has so far confirmed a figure for any offer, while Clipper did not confirm Parkin’s alleged involvement.</p>
      <p>“The board of Clipper Logistics notes the press speculation and confirms it has received a preliminary approach from Sun European Partners, LLP in relation to the potential acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of the Company,” Clipper said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>“There can be no certainty that an offer will be made for the Company, nor as to the terms on which any offer will be made.”</p>
      <p>Sun Capital Partners now has until 18 December to table a firm offer for Clipper.</p>
      <p>Parkin, who is executive chairman of Clipper, holds a stake worth around a third of the firm, which provides delivery services for online retailers like Asos and John Lewis.</p>
      <p>With allies’ support he could command 40 per cent of the company’s voting stock in favour of his bid, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/clipper-logistics-founder-fashions-300m-takeover-bid-11865145">Sky News</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Parkin has reportedly become frustrated by the fall in Clipper’s share price over the last year. Profit slipped by £1m to £17m in the firm’s latest annual results, while its stock has tumbled from a January 2018 high of 485p to yesterday’s close at 242.5p.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Liberum set a target price of 375p for the FTSE All Share firm this morning, saying: “A £300m valuation for Clipper would imply an April 2020E P/E of around 15x and EV/Ebitda around 8.5x.</p>
      <p>“While Clipper has stronger forecast earnings growth than Wincanton, we see potential support for Wincanton’s valuation at the current low levels (March 2020E: P/E 7.3x, EV/Ebitda 6.6x using the most conservative pension adjustments).”</p>
