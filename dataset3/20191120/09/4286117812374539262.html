      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanjay Raut has written a letter to Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on his seat change</li>
        <li>Raut has said the move was a bid to humiliate him and Shiv Sena</li>
        <li>Sanjay Raut also said NDA has not formally removed Sena</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has launched a vehement attack on the BJP-led NDA and shot a letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Nadu saying moving him to the 5th row is an attempt to humiliate him and the party.</p>
      <p>In a heavily worded letter addressed to Venkaiah Naidu, Sanjay Raut has said, "I think that this decision was taken by someone deliberately to hurt the sentiments of Shiv Sena Party and to suppress our voice."</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut added, "I may remind you that even when NDA was in Opposition, I was allotted a 3rd row seat in the House in view of my seniority in Rajya Sabha, but now, what I feel, it is clearly shows that my seat has been allotted in the 5th row intentionally to humiliate me and my party's status in the House. (sic)"</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut has said he fails to understand the reason behing "this unwarranted step of re-allocation of seats since there is no formal announcement about the removal from NDA".</p>
      <p>The senior party leader and MP has further said that the move has hurt the dignity of the Parliament and has demanded that he be allotted a seat in any of the first three rows according to the decorum of the House.</p>
      <p>Raut has also raised questions on Venkaiah Naidu's conduct of Rajya Sabha and said, "... Chairperson is above party affiliations and should takes decisions in a non-partisan manner. (sic)"</p>
      <p>
        <b>'NOT REMOVED FROM NDA'</b>
      </p>
      <p>In his letter to the Rajya Sabha chairman, Sanjay Raut has also said that there is no reason behind this seat change as Shiv Sena is still officially a part of NDA.</p>
      <p>He has said there has been no "formal announcement about the removal from NDA".</p>
      <p>Allies Shiv Sena and BJP fought the Maharashtra assembly elections together and got a clear mandate to form the government. However, soon after the results were announced, the two parties had a fallout over power sharing.</p>
      <p>BJP and Shiv Sena has since then made several viscious attacks to blame each other for the stalemate over government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena has even removed its lone minister in the NDA government at the Centre in order to facilitate talks with arch rivals NCP and Congress.</p>
