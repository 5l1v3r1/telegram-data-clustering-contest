      <h1>Victor Orta says Leeds star had offers from England overseas in the summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:15:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.leedsunited.com/news/team-news/25820/victor-orta-on-pablo-hernandez-contract-extension">Victor Orta has told Leeds United’s official website</a> that the club received offers from England and overseas for Pablo Hernandez in the summer, after the Spaniard signed a new two-year deal at Elland Road.</p>
      <p>Hernandez, 34, was in the final months of his Leeds contract which expired at the end of the season. The former Spain international and Valencia is now in his fourth season at Elland Road, but he is now set to complete five.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Hernandez has now clocked up a huge 132 appearances for Leeds since joining the club in the summer of 2016 under Garry Monk. He has scored 29 goals, and created a further 32 strikes in that time.</p>
      <p>Leeds confirmed that the ex-Swansea City man had agreed a new deal to keep him until the summer of 2021, and Orta claimed that the Spanish ace had been the subject of bids not only from English clubs – but also from abroad.</p>

      <p>“Pablo had options in the summer, we had offers from clubs in England and teams overseas – but he believes in this project and knows he can play a huge part in the next two years,” <a href="https://www.leedsunited.com/news/team-news/25820/victor-orta-on-pablo-hernandez-contract-extension">Orta said.</a></p>
      <p>“Again we have to thank the chairman for backing us to give players new deals and we have to acknowledge that all of those given new contracts have significantly improved under our head coach.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Keeping Hernandez key to Leeds’ promotion chances</h3>
      <p>Both on and off the pitch, Hernandez is crucial. Yes, it is clear that he is arguably Leeds’ most-technically gifted and creative player. He scores goals, he creates goals, and he can do it from out wide or in the number 10 role.</p>
      <p>But Hernandez is just as important off the pitch. His experience can be crucial for youngsters such as Jordan Stevens, Jamie Shackleton and plenty more, helping Leeds’ young midfielder learn and give them a better chance of maximising potential.</p>
      <p>Despite his age, landing Hernandez on a new deal until 2021 is excellent business.</p>
