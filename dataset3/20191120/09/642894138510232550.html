      <h1>Gauteng education in rush to place learners</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:49:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:49</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) must still find schools for 14 617 learners starting grades one and eight next year, ahead of its self-imposed 30 November deadline.</p>
      <p>This is the group of learners whose parents were required to apply via the GDE's online registration system for their preferred school.</p>
      <p>Now in its <a href="https://www.itweb.co.za/content/XnWJadvbnlOvbjO1">fourth year</a>, the online registration portal is meant to make the school application process more convenient and allow for planning and fair distribution of learners across the Gauteng education system.</p>
      <p>However, the process has experienced hiccups, particularly when it comes to <a href="https://www.itweb.co.za/content/lLn147mybpn7J6Aa">timeous placement</a> of learners.</p>
      <p>According to the GDE, during the online admissions application period, which ran from 20 May to 22 July, it received a total of 310 350 applications. Of these, 27 563 have not submitted the required documents, while 282 787 applicants submitted documents.</p>
      <p>As of 19 November, the department has placed 267 611 grade one and eight learners ahead of the 2020 school year.</p>

      <p>Education and youth development MEC Panyaza Lesufi says: “We are undoubtedly working diligently, ensuring schools increase their classroom capacity to accommodate additional unplaced learners by 30th November. Parents are therefore urged to accept offers given, or immediately object if not suitable, so that those rejected offers can be given to other applicants. Nevertheless, our main objective is ensuring no learner is without a school.”</p>
      <p>The department indicates it is working closely with schools in high-pressure zones to increase their classroom capacity to accommodate unplaced learners.</p>
      <p>“It is also important to note the department has identified some schools in affected areas which will be assisted with provision of mobile classrooms. We will also partner with independent schools to accommodate excess learners from our public schools accordingly, in consultation with respective parents.”</p>
      <p>The department advises that if a parent does not prefer the offer of placement given, they should lodge an objection with the district.</p>
      <p>“Objection forms are available at district offices. Should the parent remain dissatisfied with the outcome of the objection, they may complete an appeal form available at district offices.”</p>
