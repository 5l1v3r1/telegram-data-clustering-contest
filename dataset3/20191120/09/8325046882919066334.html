        <li>A mile-long road in London has been the city’s “Billionaires Row” since World War II: a destination for luxury, scandal, murder, and secrecy.</li>
        <li>One property was owned by Russian asset manager Iouri Chliaifchtein when it was struck by one of London’s worst burglaries.</li>
        <li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5242386.stm">In 2006, two men were sentenced at</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5242386.stm">Harrow Crown Court</a> for stealing £2 million ($2.6 million) in cars and jewellery from the home of Russian financier Iouri Chliaifchtein.</li>
        <li>It would likely have been worse had the thieves had enough time or help to make off with two more sports cars.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Exactly halfway along The Bishops Avenue lies a fairly unremarkable red brick house, one which cost financier Iouri Chliaifchtein £3 million ($4 million) in the late 1990s.</p>
      <p>Multi-millionaire Chliaifchtein, director of private wealth management company Telora Ltd, also owned an £18 million apartment in the central Belgravia district, and was well-known in the 2000s as one of London’s most successful asset managers.</p>
      <p>While Chliaifchtein succeeded in accruing wealth, his family’s home was the victim of one of London’s most expensive burglaries.</p>

      <p>O’Leary and his accomplice then proceeded to steal and speed off in a £350,000 ($437,000) Mercedes McLaren and a £50,000 ($62,000) Lexus.</p>
      <p>The burglars left a Ferrari and second Lexus behind. None of the stolen items were ever recovered.</p>

      <p>The Bishops Avenue, given its tight concentration of luxury, has always been a target for thieves, and was once known as The Burglars’ Avenue. The Chliaifchtein home has been burgled at least once more since.</p>
      <p>The homestead was ravaged again in 2012. This time the roof collapsed when <a href="https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/fire-rips-through-russian-couple-s-home-in-east-finchley-s-billionaires-row-1-1690743">a fire ripped through the property in the early hours of the morning</a>.</p>

      <p>Three family members escaped unharmed, but it took several hours and 40 firefighters to extinguish the blaze.</p>
      <p>Chliaifchtein was in the headlines a second time, this time at his second London property, a luxury apartment in Belgravia.</p>
      <p>In 2017 he sued the apartment block’s owner, 3-10 Grosvenor Crescent Management Ltd, for laying off concierge staff in April 2015.</p>

      <p>Chliaifchtein was furious with the sackings, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/15/millionaire-financier-sues-concierge-cuts-have-left-no-one-collect/">telling a judge at length</a> that this meant nobody was around to drive his car to and from the garage, and that his fishmonger was unable to deliver on at least two occasions.</p>
      <p>Chliaifchtein was also the director of the company he sued.</p>
      <p>Chliaifchtein cut his loses with No. 23 after the fire and the two break-ins.</p>
      <p>He sold it to Gopal Krishnan Gupta, the joint secretary of India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and his wife Meena, a solicitor, for £4 million ($5 million) in March 2019.</p>
