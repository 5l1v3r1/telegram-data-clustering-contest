        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/victoria-beckham/">Victoria Beckham</a> was owning the pavement as she strutted through Los Angeles on Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The mogul and former Spice Girls star was in town to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live and looked pretty chuffed about it as she headed to the studio.</p>
      <p>Well, for Victoria Beckham anyway.</p>
      <p>Famously shunning the whole smiling palaver (and cheekily owning it, may we say – snaps to her), the fashion designer actually flashed a grin as she made her way past fans.</p>
      <p>A sight for sore eyes, the star wore a white dress with black scribbles on it, as she added a pair of fuchsia pumps and a matching bag.</p>
      <p>She waxed lyrical about her husband David Beckham and their genetically-blessed brood, Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper, as she spoke about the family’s ties to LA after they lived there while David was a professional footballer.</p>

      <p>Now he’s had a statue unveiled in the city, which<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/27/david-beckham-jokes-big-bum-kids-visit-la-galaxy-statue-first-time-10991306/"> the pair’s kids happily posed in front of</a> following its recent unveiling.</p>

      <p>At the time, David filmed a set of Instagram Stories where his kids were seen staring at the club’s monument in silence, clearly in awe.</p>
      <p>Breaking the silence, David joked: ‘Is my bum big?’ before adding: ‘Your name’s are on the boots as well.’</p>
      <p>Brooklyn and Romeo are seen getting a closer look at the statue, before exclaiming: ‘ So cool’ and ‘that’s pretty sick’ respectively. Romeo also added on Instagram sweetly: ‘So sick ♥️ proud of u dad.’</p>

      <p>David, 44, relished in the moment and admitted he was ‘emotional’ alongside a crying gif.</p>
      <p>‘It was really exciting for us to go and take all the kids and them to take selfies and comment on the size of daddy’s bottom in bronze,’ Victoria laughed this week.</p>
      <p>‘I think it’s such a huge honour. We loved living in LA, every time we come back the kids say they feel like they’re coming home.’</p>
      <p>Talk soon turned to the weird and wonderful of Tinseltown, as Victoria recalled Halloween, where Harper, eight, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/harper-beckham-makes-brilliant-billie-eilish-beckhams-halloween-style-11022651/">was dressed as Billie Eilish</a>…and went to Justin Bieber’s house to trick or treat.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘He texted David, this was on Halloween, he asked what David was doing, he was out trick or treating with the kids, [Justin] said “Come over, I’m giving out snow cones”.’</p>

      <p>As you do, let’s just go and get a snow cone from Biebs.</p>
      <p>Victoria continued: ‘He’s such a nice man.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve bumped into him a few times, normally he’s on his skateboard around Beverly Hills, getting a doughnut.’</p>
      <p>Classic Bieber.</p>
