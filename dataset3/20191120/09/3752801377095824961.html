      <h1>WATCH | Family takes body bag to Old Mutual branch over claims policy unhappiness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:25:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:25</time> by <a rel="author">Kaveel Singh</a></address>
      <p>An unhappy family went to extreme lengths to settle a funeral policy claim when they took the purported body of a loved one in a body bag to an Old Mutual branch.</p>
      <p>The company says the claim has been paid.</p>
      <p>In a video that has gone viral on social media since Tuesday night, two women, thought to be family members, can be seen walking out the unnamed KwaZulu-Natal branch while carrying a body bag that appears to contain a corpse.</p>
      <p>As they struggle to haul the bag to their vehicle, a man can be heard asking them why they brought the body along and if their policy was paid.</p>
      <p>One of the women replies: "They just paid now. That's why we took the body in."</p>
      <p>Responding to the video on Twitter, Old Mutual said it was "most unsettling" and that they were "sympathetic towards the family during this difficult time".</p>
      <p>"We can confirm that the claim was paid. Due to the sensitive nature of this matter, we will continue engaging directly with the family."</p>
      <p>The company assured customers that claims were "assessed on an individual basis and the incident at this branch, whilst isolated, is regrettable".</p>
      <p>"While we make every attempt to settle claims as speedily as possible, this specific claim had to undergo further assessments. Old Mutual strives to pay claims speedily - 99% of funeral claims are paid within eight hours once all requirements are met."</p>
      <p>News24 has reached out to Old Mutual for further comment and is awaiting their response to a series of questions.</p>
