      <p>South Korean mobile operator LG Uplus teamed up with Viettel to launch roaming service for its 5G customers travelling in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The operators completed joint roaming tests, achieving peak download speeds of 72.4Mb/s.</p>
      <p>In September, the military-run operator <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/viettel-nokia-pilot-5g-in-ho-chi-minh-city/">deployed an end-to-end 5G network </a>in a district in Ho Chi Minh City, using gear from Nokia. Together with Ericsson, Viettel in May demonstrated the first 5G connection in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Viettel said the roaming speeds offered were slower than regular 5G data speeds in Vietnam because LG Uplus wants to keep its roaming customers from incurring high charges.</p>
      <p>LG Uplus, the third largest operator in South Korea by subscribers, also is <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/lg-uplus-china-unicom-team-on-5g-roaming/">partnering with China Unicom</a> to offer 5G roaming service for customers in China.</p>
      <p>Viettel, with a 41 per cent market share by subscribers, <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/viettel-cleared-to-trial-5g-in-cities/">received a trial licence</a> in January to use the 3.8GHz and 28GHz bands for tests in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and has already invested about $40 million in 5G.</p>
