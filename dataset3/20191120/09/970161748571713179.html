      <p>A former soldier who earned the nickname ‘Popeye’ after injecting his arms with jelly to create bulging biceps has had to undergo surgery to save his life.</p>
      <p>Kirill Tereshin, 23, was warned he could die or need to have both his arms amputated because of the articifial biceps he had created.</p>
      <p>Surgeons at First Moscow State Medical University in the Russian capital said they had removed 3lb of dead muscle and three litres of petroleum jelly that had formed into a solid lump.</p>
      <p>And lead surgeon Dmitry Melnikov said his team was only a quarter of the way through the huge operation.</p>
      <p>It will take at least three more surgeries for all of the Vaseline-like jelly to be removed from Kirill’s arms, Dr Melnikov said.</p>
      <p>The bodybuilder – who found global fame for his fake bulging biceps – was persuaded to undergo urgent treatment by Alana Mamaeva, 32, a leading campaigner for victims of botched plastic surgery.</p>

      <p>She released a video showing Kirill after his first operation frantically asking the surgeon: ‘How many muscles have I lost?’</p>

      <p>The surgeon said: ‘The problem is that this is the petroleum jelly. You injected this so thoroughly, that it spread in the muscle and killed it.</p>
      <p>‘It was dead anyway.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘We have done 25% of the repairs.’</p>
      <p>Kirill has been told he will have arm movement but the muscles in his arms will be diminished.</p>
      <p>Alana, who helped raise funds for his surgery, said: ‘We are going to try and help this young man.’</p>
      <p>Former army conscript Kirill told her before the operation: ‘I am ready, I am even not afraid.’</p>
      <p>Dr Melnikov told his patient: ‘Petroleum jelly saturates the muscles, under skin tissues and the skin itself.</p>
      <p>‘All that has to be removed, but we need to keep the vein, nerves and other functions of the limb.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘Petroleum jelly is not designed for injection, only external application. Kirill injected about three litres into each arm.</p>
      <p>‘It saturated the muscle tissues, blocked blood flow and as a result the tissue dies and gets replaced with a scar which is as tough as a tree.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He said the implants were causing him ‘high fever, strong pain, and weakness’.</p>
      <p>Kirill was ‘lucky’ that the damage had remained only in his limbs and not spread to the rest of his body, the surgeon said.</p>
      <p>Dr Melnikov added: ‘Petroleum jelly affects the whole body, kidneys in particular.</p>

        <figcaption>Surgeons said he would need three more operations to fully remove all the jelly he had injected (Picture: east2west news)</figcaption>

      <p>‘I think Kirill did not fully realise the consequences of what he had been doing.’</p>
      <p>In Russia, plastic surgery involving injecting petroleum jelly under the surface of the skin has been on the rise, especially with people seeking ‘fillers’.</p>
      <p>The surgeon said he had seen patients previously who had the dangerous substance injected into their breasts, buttocks and faces.</p>
