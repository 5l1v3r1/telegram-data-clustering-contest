      <p>The results show which career has the winning edge and which age and gender have won the most series and trials.</p>
      <p>The anaylsis also revealed who is most likely to leave first and do the Bushtucker trials.</p>
      <p>With age, gender and career on her side, Jacqueline could win the series.</p>
      <p>The analysis claimed that at 27 years old, the star has a "higher chance of winning and doing better in trials, falling in the under 30 categories".</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, three of the previous winners have all been actors, putting Jacqueline in "good stead for the series".</p>

      <p>According to the research, two other contestants stand out in the analysis.</p>
      <p>Myles Stephenson is another favourite as he's also under 30 and "shares the combination of being selected for lots of early trials and performing relatively well in them".</p>
      <p>The third likely star to win the series is Caitlyn Jenner as she has both reality TV and sporting experience.</p>
      <p>Last night's episode saw the campmates of Snake Rock take on a Bushtucker trial to get back to the main camp of Croc Creek.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline, Caitlyn, Ian Wright, James Haskell and Andrew Maxwell took part in the challenge.</p>

      <p>The group had to each put their head into a perspex helmet, which is then filled with a different critter.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn was joined by snakes, James had rats, Andrew had cockroaches, Ian was joined by scorpions and Jacquline faced her fear of spiders.</p>
      <aside>I feel like this is too soon to cry but I'm going to cry.</aside>
      <p>Jacqueline <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jacqueline-jossas-tears-despite-nailing-bushtucker-trial/">was left in tears during her turn but still managed to bag two stars, meaning two meals for camp</a>.</p>
      <p>Before her challenge, she said: "I feel like this is too soon to cry but I'm going to cry."</p>
