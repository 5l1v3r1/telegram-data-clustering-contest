      <h1>A Dartmoor Christmas tree will take a starring role in this year's General Election</h1>
      <h2>Downing Street's Christmas tree has been grown in Devon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:42:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author">Colleen Smith</a></address>
      <p>A Christmas tree grown on Dartmoor will be at the centre of the drama that plays out on the steps of Number 10 Downing Street for this year's General Election.</p>
      <p>The tree will be supplied once again by Dartmoor Christmas Trees after they won the title of British Christmas Tree Grower of the Year. They have previously also supplied trees for inside the Prime Minister's residence and the wreath for the famous front door at Number 10.</p>
      <p>But this year will be different. Because of the rarity of December General Elections, the famous front steps at Downing Street are not usually in the spotlight as much as they will be in 2019 during the festive season.</p>
      <p>This is only the fifth time a General Election has been held in December - the last was held in 1923 and it was the first time Labour won, under Ramsay MacDonald.</p>

      <p>Stuart and Jennie Kirkup who run Dartmoor Christmas Trees say it's been a great growing year for trees in Devon.</p>
      <p>Stuart said: â€œThis year has been a great year for the trees with a mixture of intense sunshine and showers, which has been great for growth".</p>
      <p>The family have won Champion Grower twice, in 2016 and 2019. In this year's competition they also won three other awards: Best Natural Wreath, Runner up Best Other Fir (Fraser) and Best Nordman Fir.</p>

      <p>Stuart, Jennie and their family who have been growing Christmas Trees in the heart of Dartmoor for nearly 20 years have won 36 industry awards for their trees and wreaths.</p>
      <p>Stuart attributes their success to their passion about what they do and the dedication to producing beautiful trees that are local and sustainable.</p>
      <p>Dartmoor Christmas Trees work with Forestry England at Haldon Forest in Exeter and will be selling their trees in the retail centre there this year. Whether you prefer the low drop Nordman fir or Fraser fir or the traditional smells and shape of the Norway spruce they can help you decide on your perfect Christmas Tree.</p>
      <p>Dartmoor Christmas Trees can also be bought at Morrison superstores in Paignton and Totnes.</p>
