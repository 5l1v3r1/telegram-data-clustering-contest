      <h1>Paedophilia: Australian universities cut ties with Britain’s Prince Andrew</h1>

      <p>Two Australian universities severed ties with a charity founded by Prince Andrew Wednesday, after the British royal refused to recant his friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Bond University and RMIT University in Melbourne said they would no longer work with “Pitch@Palace” — a charity founded by the Duke of York, 59, to promote entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Queensland’s Bond University said it had planned to review its work with “Pitch@Palace” next year, but brought forward the decision.</p>
      <p>“In light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement,” a spokesperson told AFP.</p>
      <p>RMIT University said its “involvement with Pitch@Palace concluded in October 2019” and would not be renewed.</p>
      <p>“We remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring RMIT is a safe and inclusive place to work and study,” the university said.</p>
      <p>A third Australian institution, Murdoch University, said it “is currently reviewing its support of the Pitch@Palace event in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Businesses and universities in the United Kingdom have already announced they will no longer associate themselves with the Prince or his charities.</p>
      <p>This came after he denied having sex with a 17-year-old girl during a lengthy and much-condemned BBC interview in which he also described Epstein’s behaviour as “unbecoming.”</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old Epstein was found dead in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Centre on August 10 as he awaited trial on allegations that he trafficked girls as young as 14 for sex.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered and KPMG had already indicated they would review ties with the Prince’s charities.</p>
