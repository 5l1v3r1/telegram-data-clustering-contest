      <h1>Graeme Souness lifts lid on Jose Mourinho 'anger' at Man Utd after taking Tottenham job</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has secured a return to management at Tottenham after spending time as a Sky Sports pundit since leaving Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:10:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:10</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Graeme Souness believes Jose Mourinho's anger at his Manchester United exit will spark him into life at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> .</p>
      <p>Mourinho has secured a return to management with Spurs, 11 months after he was sacked by United.</p>
      <p>He has been confirmed as Mauricio Pochettino's replacement, agreeing a three-and-a-half year deal in north London.</p>
      <p>Since leaving United, the Portuguese boss has been working as a pundit for Sky Sports alongside Souness.</p>
      <p>And the Scot has opened up on the mindset of Mourinho, having got to know him during his time in the studio.</p>

      <p>“Deep inside he is an angry and frustrated man with the way it turned out for him at United, Spurs will reap the benefit of that," Souness said.</p>
      <p>“Will they win the league this year? No. But they will be far more difficult to play against.</p>
      <p>“He talks common sense at that is basically what football is about. Off-camera he is jovially funny, he is engaging, extremely knowledgeable and desperate to get back into football.</p>
      <p>"He will know where he could have done better and decisions he made he wishes he hadn’t made. Spurs will reap the benefit of that big time.”</p>

      <p>Tottenham return to action in the Premier League against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>Spurs sit 14th after a disappointing start to the season but could rise as high as fifth if results go their way.</p>
      <p>On his appointment, Mourinho said: "I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
