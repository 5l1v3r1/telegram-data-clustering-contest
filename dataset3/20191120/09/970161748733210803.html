      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has already highlighted what went wrong for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> before the Argentine was sacked by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>After five-and-a-half years at the club and less than six months after guiding the team to a Champions League final, Pochettino’s time at Spurs ended on Tuesday evening <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoint-jose-mourinho-new-manager-replacing-mauricio-pochettino-11185760/">while Mourinho was officially announced as his replacement on Wednesday.</a></p>
      <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has pointed to Spurs’ poor domestic form as the reason behind the surprise decision as the team have picked up just 25 points from their last 24 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho believes the players who wanted to leave Tottenham in the summer, including Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, have had an impact on the rest of the squad and performance levels have dropped as a result.</p>
      <p>‘I think probably last season, in the last part of the season, I think that maybe they know that they have no chance to fight for the title,’ Mourinho told Sky Sports in September.</p>

      <p>‘At the same time, they don’t feel big pressure from United, from Chelsea, from the teams that could stay ahead of them so they have the fourth position more or less under control.</p>

      <p>‘One point here, one point there was enough for them to keep that control. Probably the Champions League becomes step after step the dream for them. Maybe it took away the focus from them. I think this is quite a linear way to look at it.</p>
      <p>‘But, I am afraid that I’m wrong but also I’m afraid that I’m right.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe, this season they are not having that kind of chemistry that I felt that they had in the team. I don’t know if I’m right, of course.</p>
      <p>‘I always felt that Spurs in the last years, of course they were not buying or not buying a lot, but they were doing something that for me is even more important which is to keep all the good players that they have.</p>
      <p>‘Somehow, with Mauricio, with Mr [Daniel] Levy, with everything around the club, they persuade the players to stay and to stay happy. That was my feeling… perfect chemistry.</p>

      <p>‘They managed to give some new contracts to Harry Kane and to other players and they looked happy to belong to that project, to that club, to that dream.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe now, the feeling that I have with what is happening with Eriksen, with Vertonghen at the end of last season, with Alderweireld, it looks like probably now, some of the boys are not so happy to stay.</p>

      <p>‘They have their eyes in bigger pictures. Other players getting more money to them, other players winning titles. Look to Kyle Walker winning trophies. Looking to the possibility of playing for Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe in this moment the team is not that focused family full of chemistry. It looks to me like the relationship with Mauricio is fantastic, they are more than happy to work with him.</p>
      <p>‘The club grew up, amazing stadium to play, Champions League again. But maybe some of the boys they want something different.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes, even in the perfect group, it is only one that is not happy, is something that can create a situation where step by step they lose a little bit of focus.’</p>
