      <h1>Argos Has Knocked 20 Per Cent off All Star Wars, Frozen, and Marvel Toys</h1>

      <p>It's Wednesday, which means Argos is back with another Crazy Code offer - knocking 20 per cent off a specific brand or line of toys for one whole week. This one is actually a big one, since the retailer is l<a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/list/shop-for-star20-at-argos?tag=ar:browse:clp:toys:m004.1:star20promohero">etting you pay less on all <i>Frozen, Star Wars</i>, and Marvel toys.</a></p>
      <p>In other words, some of the toys that will probably be in the most demand this Christmas. I'm assuming, since I don't know any kids. Oh, and it includes Lego.</p>
      <p>There's no minimum spend this week, and assuming you use the code <b>Star20</b> during the checkout process it means you total will drop by a fifth. And like previous Crazy Code weeks, this deal will stack on top of any existing offers that are available. So if any items are on sale already will still be eligible for a further 20% discount. It's pretty sweet to be honest.</p>
      <p>Home delivery does come with delivery fees, which start at £3.95, but you can still choose to collect your order in your local Argos instead. Either pay online and have the discount applied there, or reserve everything and quote the code to the person behind the till when you arrive.</p>
