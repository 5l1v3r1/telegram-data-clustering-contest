      <h1>PARTYNEXTDOOR Purportedly Dropping New Music on Friday</h1>
      <h2>Could ‘Club Atlantis’ finally be releasing?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:08:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author">Torsten Ingvaldsen</a></address>
      <p>It seems the return of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/partynextdoor">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a> is right around the corner. Just yesterday the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ovo">OVO</a>-signed R&amp;B heavyweight shared an Instagram post with the caption “Friday,” alluding to his return to music after a nearly two-year hiatus following the release of 2017’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2017/9/partynextdoor-seven-days-ep-stream"><i>Seven Days</i></a>. This past August, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/drake">Drake</a> promised that the crooning singer-songwriter <a href="https://twitter.com/aubsjaded/status/1158642490028826629">had new music coming</a>.</p>
      <p>Rumored to be titled <i>Club Atlantis</i>, the followup album to 2016’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2016/8/partynextdoor-p3-album-stream"><i>PARTNEXYDOOR 3</i></a> has been one of the most highly-anticipated released under the OVO umbrella. In 2017 he <a href="https://twitter.com/partynextdoor/status/933172384634257408">shared</a> “I’m taking my time with this album, It’s straight party &amp; unapologetic.” A year later he shared that his “fourth album finna drop I been yelling timber before wiggin’s.” Since then, PND has taken a break from social media, driving him into an enigmatic state that has fans craving for updates. He most recently teased snippets of a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/partynextdoor-rihanna-new-collab-song-preview">collaboration</a> with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/rihanna">Rihanna</a> in March.</p>
