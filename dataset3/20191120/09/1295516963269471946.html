          <b>WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman/">Batman</a> #83 by Tom King, Mikel Janín, Jordie Bellaire and Clayton Cowles, on sale now.</b>

      </p>
      <p>Alfred Pennyworth met his apparent end at Bane's hands in <i>Batman</i> #77. Despite the graphic portrayal of his death, though, readers were given hope that it was somehow all a ruse, as indicated in <i>Batman</i> #79. However, <i>Batman</i> #83 dashes the hopes of those readers, as well as Batman himself, in a dramatic definitive fashion</p>
      <p>After being shot by <a href="https://screenrant.com/batman-comic-flashpoint-father/">an alternate reality version of his father Thomas Wayne</a> last issue, Batman awakens -- apparently also again healed by him -- seated at the Wayne Manor dining room table. And when his eyes first open, he sees a very sad and ghastly site seated across from him: the lifeless body of his confidante and father figure Alfred.</p>

      <h3>RIP Alfred Pennyworth – For Real This Time</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Batman-Alfred-death.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=313&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>Alfred's body has been grotesquely left in the same state it was when Bane killed him, confirming that Alfred's demise truly did play out <a href="https://www.cbr.com/batman-bane-really-kill-alfred/">as first shown</a>. Doubt was cast in issue #79 when Batman noted that Alfred had signaled him to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/batman-alfred-still-alive-explained/">indicate that he was safely away</a> from Bane. This development led to speculation that Alfred wasn't killed in issue #77. The possibility of a double was further cemented when Batman revealed in issue #81 the shapeshifting <a href="https://www.cbr.com/batman-clayface-gotham-knights-return/">Clayface had been deployed</a> in Gotham by Batman during his absence.</p>
      <p>Sadly, this issue confirms that it was Alfred, not Clayface or any other imposter, who was murdered by Bane. While Alfred created a ruse, it wasn't the kind many believed or hoped for. Alfred did indeed signal Bruce that he was safe, but in truth, he was not. In fact, Alfred was already certain that he wasn't going to survive.</p>
      <p>He lied.</p>

      <p>Why would Alfred do such a thing, essentially assuring his own death? Alfred himself explains his reasoning to Bruc, in a letter that serves as the issue's voiceover while Batman deals with the discovery of his longtime friend's murder.</p>
      <p>Knowing the so-called "City of Bane" was actually under Thomas' control, Alfred cites and praises Bruce's plan to take it back. He also notes that there's only one obstacle in the way of that plan: himself. Alfred knew that Batman would never launch his plan if he believed Alfred were in danger, so he lied to Bruce, basically guaranteeing his demise so that Batman wouldn't be hampered by the need to save him.</p>
      <h3>Why Alfred Died</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/batman-83-crying.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=357&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>"I am again putting my ideal above my current need," Alfred poignantly writes to Bruce. "I choose not to be an instrument of your downfall, but to be a cause of your salvation. I will die here. I choose to die here."</p>
      <p>Alfred sees Bruce's eventual defeat of Thomas, and subsequent reclamation of Gotham, as critical steps in Bruce's journey towards true happiness. And like any father-figure, Alfred has wanted nothing more for his son than for him to achieve it. Here, he simply realizes that his current predicament puts that desire in jeopardy, so he willingly elects to make the ultimate sacrifice for Bruce's sake.</p>
      <p>It's been a painful emotional journey, teased with the possibility of false hope, witnessing Alfred's tragic fate. This issue at least shows his death wasn't merely collateral damage -- it was instead a heroic sacrifice in the name of love for the man that Alfred has long considered to be nothing less than a true son.</p>
      <p>Now, Batman is set for a final showdown with Thomas Wayne, the <i>other</i> man who considers himself to be his father -- the man truly responsible for Alfred's death -- commences in Batman #84, on sale December 4.</p>
