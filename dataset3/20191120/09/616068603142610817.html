      <p>The Kelowna Rockets look to settle the score when they host the Victoria Royals tonight at Prospera Place.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, the Royals took advantage of Rocket mistakes in a 6-3 victory. They scored in bunches that night, scoring three times on their first six shots and three more on their last six.</p>
      <p>The Rockets come into the game a single point up on Victoria and two behind Vancouver as the teams battle for second, third and fourth in the BC Division.</p>
      <p>Victoria comes in riding a four-game winning streak, while the Rockets snapped a four-game losing skid, beating Kamloops last Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Anytime you face a B.C. Division team those are huge games for us and for the two points," said forward Alex Swetlikoff.</p>
      <p>"I think we need to keep building off of last game said. We're the best when we stay out of the penalty box and are playing teams five on five.  When we get our forecheck going and have a good neutral zone, I think we're successful."</p>
      <p>Swetlikoff has been enjoying his best stretch as a Rockets of late, scoring goals in four of his last six games.</p>
      <p>"I've been a little more hungrier, I've been shooting more and going to the net. I think I've been more physical and that's gotten me into the game more and made me better prepared."</p>
      <p>The Rockets hit the road Thursday morning for weekend games in Seattle and Tri-City.</p>
