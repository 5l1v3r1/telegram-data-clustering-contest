      <p>After the recent release of Pokemon Sword and Shield, it's no surprise that the titles are now being bundled with Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>
      <p>What is surprising is the excellent value that these bundles represent. The bundle price matches the normal list price for the console (£279), which means you can play either Pokemon Sword or Shield at no extra cost. This is one of the better early Black Friday deals, and well worth your consideration at this time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bd9m">Nintendo Switch with Pokemon Sword or Shield</a> - was £323.99, now £279.00</li>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bcrs">Nintendo Switch Lite with Pok</a><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bcrs">emon Sword or Shield</a> - was £243.99, now £219.00</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're not interested in using the Switch docking capabilities, the Switch Lite also has a Pokemon bundle available. At £219, this deal isn't as great, but still presents a decent discount for those looking to invest in both the game and console at the same time.</p>
