      </p>
      <p>The Scots singer, 32, also branded the Lib Dem leader a "charlatan" for her time as East Dunbartonshire MP.</p>

      <p>Last night saw the first in a series of head-to-head debates between party leaders in the run-up to the general election.</p>
      <p>Labour chief Jeremy Corbyn faced off one-on-one against Tory leader Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The SNP and Lib Dems were not part of the main debate after losing a legal battle to be included.</p>

      <p>But party chiefs Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson, as well as Nigel Farage of the Brexit Party and Greens co-leader Sian Berry, were interviewed live by host Nina Hossain afterwards.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader repeated her promise to revoke Article 50 if her party win on December 12 - and confirmed she would not put Corbyn or Johnson into power.</p>

      <p>But it was her quick-fire response to a question about nuclear weapons that irked Macdonald.</p>
      <p>When asked if she would be prepared to use nukes, Swinson swiftly replied: "yes.".</p>
      <p>And the This Is The Life singer - who has had Swinson as her MP for more than a decade - was left fuming by her answer.</p>
      <p>In a now-deleted tweet, she wrote: "Swinson has been my MP for pretty much my entire voting life. She has been a charlatan the entire time.</p>
      <p>"It took her one second to say that she'd happily drop nuclear weapons. Imagine voting her her?!?</p>
      <p>"Liberal?! Hang on till I drop my nukes. Then we'll talk."</p>
      <p>Her tweet racked up around 1,000 likes and more than 300 retweets before the singer pulled it from the site.</p>
      <p>And responding to another social media user's comment about Swinson, she said: "I actually can't believe it. It's madness.</p>
      <p>"What's wrong with the world that it's an acceptable answer to say you'd happily kill thousands of people and potentially start a nuclear war without a second thought."</p>
      <p>The Scottish Sun has approached the Lib Dems for comment.</p>
