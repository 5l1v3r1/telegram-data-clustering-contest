      <h1>Olivier Ntcham goes in-depth on Celtic glory goal and reveals celebration almost ended in disaster</h1>
      <h2>The French midfielder scored the unforgettable goal that sent the Hoops into the Europa League last 32.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:00:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>The thing about the dodgy first touch is you don't get the impudent finish without it.</p>
      <p>Had <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/olivier-ntcham">Olivier Ntcham</a> teed himself up perfectly there would've been no cause to casually dink the ball over Thomas Strakoshka.</p>
      <p>But it was typical of the way the stars aligned for one of the most memorable moments in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>'s recent history, an imperfect piece of play opening the door for the most perfect of goals.</p>
      <p>Almost two weeks on from the moment he sunk <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a>, and despite the rush of adrenaline that followed, Ntcham still remembers every second in vivid detail.</p>
      <p>From being subbed on with 13 minutes to play, to being oblivious that his deft swing of the right boot was to be the game's last, the Frenchman recalls all of it.</p>

      <p>"I wasn't really aware of how little time we had left when the chance came to me," Ntcham told the Celtic View, reliving how he secured <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> last 32 qualification.</p>
      <p>"My first touch wasn't so great, so the only option was to lift it over the keeper. If my first touch was better I would've hit it hard, but I was too close to do that so I had to improvise.</p>
      <p>"I was really proud to have helped the team secure the win and to have given the fans and the club a special moment.</p>
      <p>"The team deserved to win the game and we were grateful to get that win.</p>
      <p>"I want to do so much more. I'm happy for that moment but I always want to do more and I'm not thinking too much about it.</p>

      <p>"The goal was a good thing for me and for Celtic, but there's more to come.</p>
      <p>"It was a great feeling to be involved and I was happy to be on he pitch at that moment. I was happy to be the man to score the goal for Celtic and for the fans."</p>
      <p>Ntcham's celebration was just as eye-catching, literally going head over heels in front of the away end.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has broken out the acrobatics plenty of times in a Hoops jersey but on this occasion admits his backflip almost ended in disaster.</p>
      <p>"I slipped when I tried the flip so that's why I was on my hands," he added.</p>
      <p>"Odsonne said to me afterwards I nearly broke my neck. I was too engaged in celebrating with everyone to stop and do it again.</p>
      <p>"It was too late to repeat it so I need to a little bit more on that if I am to do it again!"</p>
