      <p>A 17-year veteran officer with the Chicago police department is recovering after he was shot in the skull during a gun battle with bank robbery suspect Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The injured Chicago officer, 46, was in serious but stable condition with a skull fracture and blood on the brain, a hospital official said.</p>
      <p>The "chaotic scene" began as a bank robbery in Des Plaines, a Chicago suburb, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters. One robber was captured by Des Plaines police but a second robber escaped, stole a car and headed toward Chicago, Johnson said.</p>
      <p>Officers were able to track his movements and Chicago police officers were waiting for the suspect when he got off the expressway, Johnson said.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old suspect fired at officers, Johnson said.</p>

      <p>Des Plaines police continued with the pursuit, which ended at a music store, Johnson said. The suspect and officers exchanged gunfire, and the suspect was shot and killed, Johnson said.</p>
      <p>A 15-year-old bystander who was in the music store for a piano lesson at the time was shot in the arm and abdomen, Johnson said. The teen boy was hospitalized in stable condition, Johnson said.</p>
      <p>The injured Chicago officer, who was not named, "has received over 100 awards from the department for his exemplary police work," Johnson said.</p>
      <p>"Our hearts are breaking as we're reminded of the service and sacrifice our officers make every day to protect us and keep our communities safe," Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.</p>
