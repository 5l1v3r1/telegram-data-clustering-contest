      <h1>Tottenham fixtures: Jose Mourinho’s key dates as he starts life as new Spurs manager</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese replaces Mauricio Pochettino who was sacked as boss on Tuesday evening after five-and-a-half years in charge</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> is the new manager of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Portuguese replaces <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> who was sacked as boss on Tuesday evening after five-and-a-half years in charge.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” Mourinho said upon his appointment. “The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who won three Premier League titles in two spells with Chelsea, had been out of management since leaving United in December last year.</p>
      <p>Here we take a look at the key dates in Mourinho’s start in north London:</p>
      <h3>November 23 – West Ham (away)</h3>
      <p>Mourinho’s first game in charge is a London derby on Saturday. The sides are just a point apart in the table with the Hammers, in 16th, having slumped after a bright start to the campaign. Spurs have not won in their last five league games but, after the surprise exit of Mauricio Pochettino, it will be interesting to see how the players respond.</p>
      <h3>December 4 – Manchester United (away)</h3>
      <p>Mourinho’s appointment at Tottenham indicates his reputation has not been overly damaged by the bitter end to his two-and-a-half-year stint at United, but the trip to Old Trafford early in his Spurs tenure will be a reminder of where things went wrong. United’s form has been patchy this term, and this will be an intriguing contest.</p>
      <h3>December 11 – Bayern Munich (away)</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese has been linked with a number of positions over the last 11 months, including the hotseat at German giants Bayern. The rumours may not have developed into anything serious but the club’s profile would undoubtedly have suited him. This Champions League glamour clash will instantly appeal, although Spurs – who were thrashed 7-2 by Bayern in October – will hope to have already secured their last-16 place.</p>

      <h3>December 22 – Chelsea (home)</h3>
      <p>Barely a month into his reign, Mourinho will have to face another of his former clubs. He had some happy and successful times at Chelsea but, again, things ended in acrimony. Plenty of water has passed under the bridge at Stamford Bridge since and the current side are thriving under Frank Lampard – who starred playing under Mourinho at Stamford Bridge – but, with little love between the two sets of fans, a feisty encounter awaits.</p>
      <h3>January 11 – Liverpool (home)</h3>
      <p>Mourinho will be able to measure his side against the Premier League’s best in the new year, with the game against Liverpool followed by a visit from champions Manchester City on February 1. Liverpool have been the outstanding team of the season so far. In the recent past Spurs have tackled them head on, playing a similar style, but Mourinho may try to nullify them in the way his United sides did.</p>
