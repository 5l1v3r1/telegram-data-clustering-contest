      <p>Singapore reached the top 10 most competitive countries in the world for talent according to Switzerland’s <a href="https://www.imd.org/wcc/world-competitiveness-center-rankings/world-talent-ranking-2019/">IMD World Talent Ranking 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>The ranking studied how 63 countries cultivate, attract, and retrain a skilled workforce.</p>
      <p>It considered factors such as investment and development on education and health infrastructure, cost and quality of living and worker motivation, as well as economic readiness to hone relevant skills for the workforce.</p>
      <p>Singapore is the only Asian country in the top 10.</p>

      <p>IMD’s top 10 world economies for competitive talent include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Switzerland</li>
        <li>Denmark</li>
        <li>Sweden</li>
        <li>Austria</li>
        <li>Luxembourg</li>
        <li>Norway</li>
        <li>Iceland</li>
        <li>Finland</li>
        <li>The Netherlands</li>
        <li>Singapore</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The study showed that Singapore scored well in terms of its readiness due to students’ high scores in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), high graduate percentage in the sciences, effectiveness of primary and secondary education, and student mobility.</p>
      <p>Singapore scored fairly low in the implementation of apprenticeships and prioritization of employee training. Singapore also ranked quite low considering the percentage of females in the workforce./TISG</p>
