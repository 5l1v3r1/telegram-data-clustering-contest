      <h1>IGP commissions District Police Headquarters at Manso-Adubia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:59:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Yussif Ibrahim, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Manso-Adubia (Ash), Nov 19, GNA - The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mr James Oppong Boanuh, has commissioned a newly-constructed district police headquarters at Manso-Adubia in the Amansie South District.</p>
      <p>The project, funded jointly by the Adubia Traditional Council and the District Assembly, seeks to address the perennial security challenges in the area.</p>
      <p>The District, which has been under the supervision of the Amansie West District Command since it was carved out of that District in 2015, can now boast of its own District Police command.</p>
      <p>For this, hundreds of residents who witnessed the colourful ceremony could not hide their excitement.</p>
      <p>The IGP praised the traditional council and the Assembly for constructing the edifice which, he said, would go a long way to enhance security in the District.</p>
      <p>“The provision of the facility by the two bodies was a laudable initiative, in view of the fact that the District was fraught with many security challenges,” the IGP said.</p>
      <p>According to him, effective policing, thrived on strong partnership between the public and the police, and urged the people to support the police by volunteering vital information to rid society of criminals.</p>
      <p>Mr Boanuh entreated community members to cooperate with the police and live in harmony, always seeking redress through the appropriate channels rather than resorting to violence, adding that no police officer would be shielded for any acts of misconduct.</p>
      <p>Cautioning the police personnel against the wanton abuse of civilians’ human rights, he stressed the need for them to be professional all the time.</p>
      <p>Mr Simon Osei Mensah, the Ashanti Regional Minister, said the project typified the unity between the Assembly and the Traditional Council and called on other stakeholders to emulate the exemplary leadership quality.</p>
      <p>He said leadership was about pursuing issues that would benefit the larger society and commended the two institutions for showing the way for others to follow.</p>
      <p>The Regional Minister was hopeful that the station’s elevation to a District status, would significantly improve security and appealed to the IGP to deploy more officers to the District, which had a total population of 77,000 people.</p>
      <p>Mr William Asante Bediako, the District Chief Executive (DCE), said the provision of the facility did not mark the end of security challenges in the area and called on all stakeholders to continue playing their respective roles to ensure maximum security.</p>
      <p>He advised the people to be responsible for their own personal security and endeavour to complement the police to succeed in their core mandate of protecting lives and properties.</p>
      <p>The DCE also commended the traditional rulers for their unflinching support since he assumed office and pledged his commitment to partner them for the development of the District.</p>
