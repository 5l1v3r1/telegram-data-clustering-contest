        <b>A refrigerated container lorry headed for the Port of Felixstowe was stopped by Dutch authorities last night who found 25 stowaways inside, it has been reported.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Crew members on a Danish-registered ferry from the Netherlands heard sounds from one of the containers at around 6pm UK time last night, and reported it to Dutch police.</p>
      <p>The boat was then forced to return to the port of Vlaardingen, around 20 minutes away from Rotterdam.</p>
      <p>Two of the stowaways were taken to hospital for medical care while the other 23 were given a medical check-up and then taken to a police facility.</p>
      <p>This discovery comes less than one month after the bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were found in an articulated refrigerator lorry in Grays, Essex.</p>
