        <b>With the international break coming to an end, focus now turns towards the return of the Premier League this weekend. Key clashes include Manchester City v Chelsea, Liverpool's trip to face Crystal Palace and Manchester United's match-up with Sheffield United.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United are looking at bringing in a Championship ace according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699799/Manchester-United-eye-Reading-starlet-Danny-Loader.html">Daily Mail</a>, with Reading's Danny Loader said to be of interest.</p>
      <p>19-year-old Loader has made 29 appearances for the Royals since breaking into the first team, and appears to have caught the eye of the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how serious United's interest is.</p>
      <p>In other news, Paul Pogba is said to prefer a move to Juventus than Real Madrid, and Manchester United defender Chris Smalling is the centre of a tug-of-war between Juventus, Inter Milan and Roma, with all three keen to sign him permanently.</p>
