      <p>Liverpool Cares is a community network of younger and older neighbours hanging out and helping one another out.</p>
      <p>They are currently running a Winter Wellbeing project that will help over 65s to stay warm, active and connected over the winter months ahead.</p>
      <p>The project sees the Liverpool Cares team delivering warm items such as blankets, hats and hot water bottles to older neighbours across Liverpool, providing a little extra warmth as we move into these colder months.</p>
      <p>Liverpool Cares will also be putting older neighbours in touch with local organisations that can offer guidance, such as ways of reducing fuel bills and tips and tricks to help insulate a cold home.</p>
      <p>By getting out across Liverpool, visiting local community groups and GP surgeries, Liverpool Cares are able to build deep connections with older neighbours who are in need of some support.</p>
      <p>June , 76, heard about the Winter Wellbeing project on BBC Radio Merseyside, and reached out personally to Liverpool Cares to ask for some warm items to help her get through the winter months ahead.</p>
      <p>Whilst dropping off a thermal blanket and some new gloves at June’s home the Liverpool Cares team were able to tell June all about the free Social Clubs that they run across the city - helping her stay connected and active- and over a nice cup of tea they also shared stories about how Liverpool has changed over the years.</p>
      <p>Liverpool Cares will be out and about across the city over the coming months, connecting with more older neighbours and telling them all about their free programmes.</p>
      <p>If you know someone who could benefit from a warm item, or you would like to hear more about their Winter Wellbeing project, please get in touch on 0151 659 1789.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There are so many heart-warming stories happening every day in our communities.</p>
      <p>Stories of people transforming unused spaces into community gardens (Homebaked), stories of neighbours of different ages connecting and supporting each other (Liverpool Cares), stories of people turning unused space into a community hub (The Ralla) and so much more.</p>
      <p>So why is it so challenging for these stories to be regular features on the pages of our newspapers and magazines?</p>
      <p>Today more than ever, these positive news and events stories offer hope and shed light on all the amazing work happening.</p>
      <p>Often, most people don’t know these things are happening right on their doorstep. Semble works with community projects across the UK, bringing them together to share stories, celebrate successes and find the resources they need to grow their impact.</p>
      <p>Since starting this page in the Liverpool Echo, they’ve connected with groups doing wonderful work across the Liverpool Region. This is why they are now bringing people together at the Make Some Noise Liverpool event to learn from each other to continue to get community stories published in local newspapers, magazines and inspire others to get involved.</p>
      <p>This is an upskilling and networking event in the heart of Liverpool on Wednesday, November 27.</p>
      <p>Join us at Make CIC, 34 Regent St, North Docks for an afternoon of meeting like minded change makers, hearing from local editors and social entrepreneurs, and celebrating the community buzz making an impact across the City Region.</p>
      <p>Are you a changemaker with a project to promote? Get your £3 ticket at www.semble.org/events/msn-liverpool and invite others to come along.</p>
      <p>Come along to Make Some Noise to meet with groups published on this page and others from across the Liverpool Area.</p>
      <p>Get ready to learn from experts, workshop ideas and talk positive news over a free drink!</p>
