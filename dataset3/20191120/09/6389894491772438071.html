      <p>HSBC’s investment banking boss is reportedly set to be replaced as part of a shake-up under interim chief executive Noel Quinn.</p>
      <p>The lender’s head of global banking and markets Samir Assaf is to be moved to a non-executive role, according to the FT.</p>

      <p>Assaf has led the unit for nearly ten years.</p>
      <p>Sources told the paper that the move could be unveiled within the coming months ahead of Quinn’s plans to announce major new strategic changes for the business.</p>
      <p>The potential replacement comes a month after HSBC posted a 19 per cent drop in third-quarter profit.</p>
      <p>Acting chief executive Noel Quinn, who took charge after the shock departure of predecessor John Flint in August, blasted the recent performance as “not acceptable”.</p>

      <p>The comments have sparked fears of job cuts amid speculation that Quinn will look to restructure large parts of the business.</p>
      <p>“There is scope throughout the bank to clarify and simplify roles, and to reduce duplication,” Quinn told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Brexit uncertainty, rising trade war tensions and continued civil unrest in Hong Kong have all contributed to a challenging environment for banking giants such as HSBC this year.</p>
      <p>While the bank’s performance in Asia has held up, in areas such as continental Europe HSBC has struggled to maintain its profit.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month HSBC received a second warning from the Bank of England over its lack of progress tackling so-called non-financial risks, according to reports in Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Assaf  told other executives on a call that the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) had given HSBC another ticking off, leading him to convene a summit of HSBC’s top brass to try to thrash out a solution to the problem.</p>
