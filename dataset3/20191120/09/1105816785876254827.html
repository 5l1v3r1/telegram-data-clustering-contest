      <p>It said the westerly wave is expected to grip upper and central parts of Pakistan. “Widespread rain/wind-thunderstorm is expected in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kashmir from Wednesday (night) to Friday,” read the advisory.</p>
      <p>“Isolated heavy falls is also expected in Quetta, Zhob, Makran, Kalat, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Mardan, Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir from Thursday (evening/night) to Friday. Snowfall is also expected over the mountains during the period.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Karachi experienced a few days of cold weather as winds blew in under the effect of a western weather system that caused rainfall in the northern areas of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>The lowest temperature ever recorded in Karachi during the month of November is 16 degrees Celsius, and the expected cold spell is not likely to break the record.</p>
