      <h1>Tiny Harris Writes Sweet Note For Joseline Hernandez After She Posted This Picture — Hazel-E Decided To Shade Her With This Comment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:59:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Mel Walker</a></address>
      <p>It seems like Joseline Hernandez was having the time of her life, being with her partner, DJ Ballistic Beats, and constantly receiving admiration from her fans.</p>
      <p>All looks well for the former <i>Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta</i> star who recently posted a photo of herself and her boyfriend, posing together in Miami’s Keystone Island district.</p>
      <p>The femcee and reality TV star expressed her joy by adding a caption to the picture, saying, “Everything on point.”</p>
      <p>Naturally, it did not take long for the numerous fans of Hernandez to appreciate the photograph, and many of her followers were soon commenting appraisals and positive remarks.</p>
      <p>Everything was fine until a peculiar comment by Hazel-E confused a lot of the adoring fans.</p>
      <p>Hazel-E left a remark, saying “Mom &amp; Dad,” an expression, which is normally used to describe two partners as the perfect couple.</p>
      <p>However, Hernandez’s fans did not take the comment in a positive way, but the very opposite — many were angered by the statement and even took it in a totally different way.</p>
      <p>For some, what Hazel-E had written was a sly reference to the fact that 33-year-old Hernandez and DJ Ballistic Beats look old.</p>
      <p>As a result, Hazel-E had to endure some backlash from Hernandez’s followers, who, in a wave of comments, reminded her that she was the same age as Joseline, and some even remarked that Hazel-E even looked older.</p>
      <p>One person told Stevie J’s ex: “Wait… Is that a wedding band on his finger?🤔 I saw Joseline with a wedding ring on too. Did y’all got married on the down-low? Love y’all as couple thou. 🔥😍💯, by the way, you look older than them frfr lbvs.🤣😣💯”</p>

      <p>Another commenter shared: “you going to call someone way younger than you mom and dad lol wake up old lady.”</p>
      <p>This backer stated: “Old as her how in the hell😂🤣😂 leave my princess lone 😂🤣🤣”</p>
      <p>So far, Hernandez has not said a word about the argument but preferred to stay private, and it looks like she and her boyfriend are doing just fine.</p>
      <p>Tiny Harris did leave a sweet comment that read: “Cute!!! 😘”</p>
      <p>Their fans will have the opportunity to watch the couple in the next season of We TV’s M<i>arriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars</i>, as was confirmed in August.</p>
