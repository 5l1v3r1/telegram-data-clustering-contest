      <h1>Jose Mourinho claimed he could never manage Tottenham after rejecting job</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese was appointed as the new Spurs boss on a three-and-a-half year deal on Tuesday evening following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:14:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:14</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho rejected Daniel Levy's first approach to appoint him as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> manager 12 years ago, citing that he couldn't do it out of respect to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>The Portuguese became the new Spurs boss on Wednesday, penning a three-and-a-half year deal as he replaced the axed Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The appointment marks Mourinho's return to Premier League football 11 months after he was sacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , and a return to London following his two spells at Stamford Bridge, where he won three Premier League titles.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," said Mourinho in <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-head-coach/">a statement on Wednesday morning</a>.</p>

      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Levy added: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football.</p>
      <p>"He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>

      <p>But back in 2015, Mourinho was playing a different tune as he recounted details of the approach from Leny.</p>
      <p>Prior to managing Chelsea in the League Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley, a match Chelsea won 2-0, the Portuguese was asked about an approach from Spurs and Levy in September 2007 after he left Stamford Bridge for the first time.</p>

      <p>'Yes. I couldn't go," he said, via the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705219/Jose-Mourinho-said-2015-NEVER-manage-Tottenham-respect-Chelsea-fans.html">Mail Online</a>. "I couldn't train in England for two years.</p>
      <p>"I would not take the job because I love Chelsea supporters too much."</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take charge of Spurs for the first time in Saturday's trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in the Premier League.</p>
