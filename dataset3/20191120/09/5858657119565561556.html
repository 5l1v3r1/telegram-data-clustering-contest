      <p>LUCKNOW, India — A government official says 22 farmers in northern India have been arrested for burning stubbles and causing some of the worst air pollution in the country.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Awanish Awasthi says those arrested in Uttar Pradesh state’s Pilibhit district on Wednesday face charges of disobeying a ban on stubble burning and making the atmosphere noxious.</p>
      <p>India’s Supreme court last week ordered a fine of up to 100,000 rupees ($1,420) for those polluting air.</p>
      <p>Air pollution in northern India peaks in the winter due to smoke from agricultural fires. The smoke mixes with vehicle emissions and construction dust.</p>
      <p>The air quality index in New Delhi exceeded 500, about 10 times the recommended maximum, early this month, but strong winds bought the level down to 250 this week.</p>
