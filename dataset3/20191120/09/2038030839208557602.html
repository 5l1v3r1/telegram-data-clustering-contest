      <p>Cape Town – The Mother of Dragons wasn't always as fearless as she appeared to be in the final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>. She recently recalled feeling pressured to do a "fuck ton" of nudity.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Dax Shepard on his podcast, <a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/emilia-clarke"><b>Armchair Expert</b></a>, she said, "I took the job, and then they sent me the scripts, and I was reading them, and I was like, 'Oh, there's the catch!' But I'd come fresh from drama school, and I approached it as a job, if it's in the script, then it's clearly needed, this is what this is, and I'm going to make sense of it. Everything's going to be cool." She recalled telling herself, "Whatever I'm feeling is wrong, I'm going to cry in the bathroom, and then I'm going to come back, and we're going to do the scene, and it's going to be completely fine."</p>
      <p>In those moments she said she had fellow co-star Jason Momoa to lean on, and he told her it's okay not be okay with those scenes, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/20/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-nude-scenes-were-terrifying"><b>The Guardian</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"He was always like, 'Can we get her a fucking robe? She's shivering'," the 33-year-old said.</p>
      <p>"He took care of me, too, in an environment where I didn't know I needed to be taken care of."</p>
      <p>The <i>Last Christmas</i> actress was 23 years old at the time, but now, ten years later, she says  "I'm a lot more savvy now with what I'm comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing.</p>
      <p>"I've had fights onset before where I'm like, 'No, the sheet stays up,' and they're like, 'You don't want to disappoint your <i>Game of Thrones</i> fans.' And I'm like, 'Fuck you.'"     </p>
      <p>This isn't the first time Emilia's spoken about nudity on the show. <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/tv/news/nudity-on-game-of-thrones-calls-to-free-the-penis-20160425?mobile=true"><b>In 2016 she told James Corden</b></a>, "I feel like there’s a little bit of inequality between the amount of nudity that happens with women, this woman in particular, and what happens with the other guys."</p>
