      <h2>Jill Green has been working for months on her coffin project</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:07:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:07</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Clarke</a></address>
      <p>The breathtaking artistry of Tutankhamen’s sarcophagus has led to a Devon woman creating her own coffin artwork.</p>
      <p>Jill Green from Barnstaple said the idea to stylise her coffin had been met with various reactions, some of which may have deterred the faint-hearted.</p>
      <p>“Having now passed the age of 70, I realised that if I did not seize the moment I’d regret it, the time has come, it’s now or never,” she said.</p>
      <p>“In the world of the undertaking, things have, and still are evolving, offering a choice now to phase out sober and gloomy ideals. So why not create something very personal which is by way of a tribute and thing of beauty? These days we dwell more on the life of the departed and celebrate their time on earth, recalling different aspects of that person and treasured memories of times shared.”</p>

      <p>Jill made arrangements with W.S Gayton and Son to outline her ideas and a suitable coffin and templates were provided for her to work directly onto.</p>
      <p>“A theme for the artwork was not difficult to arrive at,” she said. “As a child, I loved swimming and being on, or in, water, something I still very much enjoy.  I was always fascinated by and harboured the desire to be, a mermaid. This greatly amused Thaliah, my granddaughter, having told her that I would come back as one.  “I am fulfilling my promise in choosing an underwater fantasy as the theme.”</p>
      <p>The resulting coffin artwork has taken more than six months to complete, and friends of Jill have been invited to preview the work.</p>
      <p>“I am both pleased and humbled by the feedback,” she said.</p>

      <p>“In the artwork, we see a mermaid, who has travelled through a rocky cavern streaked with laser beams of sunlight, to a resting place upon a soft bed of weeds and coral.   Loosely alluding to Botticelli’s Birth of Venus, a scallop shell has been placed in the mermaid’s left hand, suggesting the title for this work - Rebirth -  which is the essence of the piece.</p>
      <p>“The right and left flanks are worked in mirror format. The central figure, the mermaid, provocatively reclines - Cleopatra on her barge. For the facial image, a copy of a photo taken during my 20’s proved suitable. The expression on the face is yielding, sensitive, joyously hopeful yet vulnerable.</p>
      <p>“Some perfectly formed air-bubble pearls, gently escape from the corner of her lips. Surrounding the face is a profusion of random hair entwined with jewels and flowers, the daisies representing purity.</p>

      <p>“Behind a piece of coral, and wound around the wrist and hand, is a silver chain bearing an amulet engraved with Sock and Buskin, theatrical masks of tragedy and comedy, a powerful lifetime love and interest, dance, especially so.  A gold plinth at the base of the amulet bears a motto from schooldays “seek goodness truth and beauty” which instilled a lifetime pursuit.</p>
      <p>“Stretching from the waist and thigh, is a sheathed series of individually formed lapis lazuli-like scales, culminate in a tapering tail. This elegant sophistication of blue, violet, yellow, orange, green and black, stirs up a frenzy and is fused with sexual energy. Discreetly visible, beneath pale blue translucent veils, is the suggestion of a bare breast and umbilicus, strong features of a true mermaid. This wonderful metamorphosis of tail fins performs a frenzied flurry, formulating magical patterns, pulsating rhythmically and uncontrollably with the give and pull of the water’s ebb and flow. The ruins of an ancient temple form a classic backdrop.</p>

      <p>“Finally, a wave bearing a cork from a bottle of champagne (my favourite drink) with a triple-pronged fish-hook screwed into its centre, bobs attractively about; it is attached to the line of an unseen fisherman. Just above the cork are some small fishing lures, one being the face of a clock reading 2-45 - my signature. Above the clock floats a crimson heart of passion, an open invitation of new love awaits.”</p>
