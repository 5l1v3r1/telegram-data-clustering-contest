        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>’ Chadwick Boseman has revealed that one of the reasons he landed his role in the Marvel franchise was because he actually auditioned for Drax in Guardians Of The Galaxy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It could have been a very different movie.</p>
      <p>While the character, known for his blunt and matter-of-fact comments, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/17/guardians-galaxys-dave-bautista-didnt-care-disney-fired-defending-james-gunn-9976751/">ended up being played by </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dave-bautista/">Dave Bautista</a>, Chadwick opened up on how the experience helped him.</p>
      <p>‘It’s about going in, I didn’t think I was going to get it, and it’s weird too because it’s a testament to Marvel – each film…has a different tone,’ he said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. ‘We didn’t know what Guardians was going to be.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t know what it was, I only had a few pages at that time so it was good to come in and play to see what they did with it.’</p>
      <p>He added to the host: ‘Sometimes that’s the way it works as an actor, you know you’re not going to get it but you’re meeting the people – they might be like, “It’s not this, but we’ll put him in this other thing.”‘</p>

      <p>Chadwick ended up landing the role of Black Panther so you could definitely say it paid off.</p>

      <p>He also became one of the best secret-keepers on set, answering all press questions <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/09/avengers-endgames-chadwick-boseman-devises-genius-way-to-avoid-spoilers-im-dead-9137134/">about Avengers: Endgame with his iconic ‘I’m dead’ line.</a></p>
      <p>Can’t beat it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Marvel is set to bless us with a Black Panther sequel following the end of phase three, but we’ve got a while to wait<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/24/black-panther-2-release-date-confirmed-marvel-fans-fuming-wait-10626348/"> as it’s not expected to land until 2022.</a></p>

      <p>Hang in there guys.</p>
      <p>Chatting about what he wants the movie to be, the star explained: ‘Hopefully we can maintain the foundation that we sort of set and build upon it and expand it and explore it. That’s what I hope.’</p>
      <p>He added <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPXFvAZKToc">to MTV International</a>: ‘But I think first you have to maintain the foundation. We built a culture and a world, so you have to make sure that you keep that in place.’</p>
      <p>Stars including Chadwick, Letitia Wright (Shuri), Lupita Nyong’o (Nakia), and Danai Gurira (Okoye) are expected to return.</p>
