      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- The House has passed a short-term spending bill to prevent the government from shutting down later this week when it was to run out of funds.</p>
      <p>The stopgap measure, known as a<a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/Further%20CR%20Section-By-Section%20Summary%20%2B%20Extenders%2011.18.19.pdf"> continuing resolution</a>, passed <a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-passes-continuing-resolution-0">231-192</a> to keep money in government coffers until Dec. 20. It will now head to the Senate for consideration before being signed by President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> to prevent a shutdown. The current stopgap spending bill is to lapse Thursday at midnight.</p>
      <p>"I pleased that we are keeping government open, assuring full funding for a fair and accurate Census, and ensuring a pay raise for our military," House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., said. "Even with passage of this CR, American families, businesses and communities need the certainty of full-year funding. Only by coming together in good faith can we settle subcommittee allocations and enact responsible, full-year spending bills that invest in critical priorities."</p>
      <p>The continuing resolution also ensures the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Census_Bureau/?tps=1">Census Bureau</a> full funding for next year's census, a 3.1 percent pay raise for uniformed services, an increase in funding for the Indian Health Service and an increase of funds to respond to the Ebola outbreak in Africa.</p>
      <p>If signed by the president, it will be Trump's second of the fiscal year, which started Oct. 1, after he <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/09/26/Senate-passes-bill-to-halt-government-shutdown-risk/6541569521152/">signed a stopgap measure</a> in late September.</p>
      <p>The measure comes <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/13/Democrats-say-House-will-vote-next-week-to-avert-government-shutdown/7831573670179/">as talks</a> over a longer deal have stalled. Although Congress has approved much of a two-year budget deal, issues remain over border security and defense funding.</p>
      <p>Last year, the country experienced<a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/01/25/Trump-signs-bill-reopening-government-after-longest-shutdown-in-history/8361548439912/"> its longest shutdown</a> in its history at 35 days over differences in opinion on funding for Trump's physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
