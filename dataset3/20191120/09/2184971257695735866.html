      <p>Mr Cheng said his captors “said they work for the secret service and that there are no human rights.</p>
      <p>“They would beat the bony parts, like my ankles… or any vulnerable part.”</p>
      <p>Mr Cheng said the Chinese authorities accused Britain of supporting demonstrations in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>He recalled: “They said I’m a state enemy and I’m a traitor, and also they asked whether the consulate instructed me to mingle with the protest.”</p>
      <p>He added: “They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests – they asked what support, money, and equipment we were giving to the protesters.</p>
      <p>“I told them I want to make it 100% clear, the UK didn’t assign resources or help with the protests.”</p>
      <p>Unrest in the city state began in the summer with calls to scrap a now-suspended extradition bill, but have now widened to protest against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.</p>

      <p>Dominic Raab has said the Government was “shocked and appalled” by Mr Cheng’s treatment which he believes “amounts to torture”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team.</p>
      <p>“I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon, in violation of China’s international obligations.</p>
      <p>“I have made clear we expect the Chinese authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account.”</p>
