      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe visited President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Wednesday (Nov. 20), receiving congratulations for the Pacific island’s democratic elections and thanks for his public support for ties with Taipei.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu elected a new parliament last September, and despite fears that a new government might mean a switch in relations to China, the new government remained faithful to Taiwan, CNA reported.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Deputy Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien (徐斯儉) traveled to Tuvalu and met with its new Prime Minister, Kausea Natano, and with Kofe.</p>
      <p>In Taipei on Wednesday, Tsai said the two countries had a lot in common, such as concerns about climate change and the development of fisheries and agriculture, as well as education, healthcare and energy.</p>
      <p>The president pointed out that immediately after taking office, Kofe held an interview with the international media in which he underlined the country’s plans to stick with Taiwan, CNA reported.</p>
