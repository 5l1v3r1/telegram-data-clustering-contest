      <p>As reported by BBC News, Japanese PM Abe told reporters at his office that he will make an all-out effort for the rest of his term to deliver on his main goals of beating deflation and revising the nation's pacifist Constitution.</p>
      <p>This is he said after becoming the longest-serving Prime Minister in Japanese history.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>"I still have nearly two years left in my term as president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Under the weight of my responsibility, I will make an all-out effort to tackle policy goals, remembering the time when I first started out feeling nervous as if walking on thin ice,"</p>
      <p>"Beyond that, revising the Constitution is also on the horizon."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair remains under pressure below 108.50, as the anti-risk Yen keeps the upper edge amid the latest US-China political tussle over the Hong Kong protestors.Â </p>
