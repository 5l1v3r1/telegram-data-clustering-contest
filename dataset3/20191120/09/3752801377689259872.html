      <p>A 13-year-old girl has been arrested for the murder of her 63-year-old grandmother, who was <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/grandmother-bludgeoned-to-death-with-a-hammer-in-her-tongaat-home-20191119">found bludgeoned to death</a> in her home in Jan Roz Crescent in Fairbreeze, Tongaat, north of Durban, on Monday.</p>
      <p>At about 09:43, members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) arrived on the scene and found Tongaat police and the provincial ambulance service in attendance.</p>
      <p>The grandmother was found lying in a pool of blood in her living room. She showed no signs of life and paramedics pronounced her dead. She had suffered blunt force trauma to her head and face.</p>
      <p>According to RUSA spokesperson Prem Balram, the 13-year-old granddaughter said she was hanging clothes on the washing line when she heard a noise in the house.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele told <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-11-18-kzn-woman-bludgeoned-to-death-in-front-of-teenage-granddaughter/">TimesLIVE</a> that the girl told police she saw an unknown man using a hammer to attack her grandmother.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Partly paralysed</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, on Tuesday, the granddaughter was arrested for the murder. </p>
      <p>Mbele confirmed the arrest to News24 on Wednesday and said the teenager would appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/kwazulu-natal/breaking-news-13-year-old-arrested-for-allegedly-bludgeoning-tongaat-gran-to-death-37622925?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=baobab">Daily News</a>, the grandmother had suffered a stroke last month and could not walk.</p>
      <p>Netwerk24 reported that she had lived in the house for more than 10 years. She was reportedly defenceless and partly paralysed. She had four children and eight grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the incident, Mbele said. </p>
