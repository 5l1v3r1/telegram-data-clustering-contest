      <h1>Everton signing Sidibe wears Red tracksuit &amp; doesn’t care despite team-mate anger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:26:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Djibril Sidibe will have wound up every single Everton fan with this interview – which is all we can ask for as Reds!</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is on loan at Goodison from Monaco – and has spoken about the first time he arrived at training wearing a red tracksuit…</p>
      <p>According to the right-back, his new team-mates told him this simply wasn’t on, but he wasn’t bothered.</p>
      <p>Speaking to French publication L’Est Eclair, cited in the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/evertons-djibril-sidibe-unfazed-red-20915265">Star</a>, Sidibe said:<b> “The first time I turned up to the training centre, I was dressed, without any meaning behind it, in a red Nike tracksuit.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“Everyone looked at me weirdly and said: ‘Never, never, never!’. I asked the guy was the problem was. You simply can’t wear the colours of the rival team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“People here are in the extreme, but I told them: ‘Hey, guys. I’m only on loan!’”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This reminds us of the outrage regarding Ronald Koeman’s red Christmas tree, actually, which was one of the funniest things in 2016.</p>
      <p>We face Everton on December 4, but first have to get through games v Crystal Palace and Brighton – neither of which will be easy considering our current injury problems.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side have an eight point lead but this could quickly disappear during the hectic December schedule.</p>
      <p>As fans, we need to make sure our support remains exceptional throughout in order to help the players through a very difficult period.</p>
