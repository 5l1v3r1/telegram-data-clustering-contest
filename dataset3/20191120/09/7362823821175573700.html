      <p>“Shamelessness," Carson wrote, "is a career politician of 30 years laying blame. Shamelessness is allowing more than 55,000 Americans to live on the very streets they represent,” he said about her district in South Los Angeles County.</p>
      <p>Carson wrote that he’s sent multiple letters to Waters’ office to discuss homelessness in her district but claimed she’s refused to meet with him.</p>
      <p>“Basic manners elude you and it seems that instead of producing results, you’re more interested in producing cheap headlines at the President’s expense — like a true career politician,” he added, according to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/18/carson-slams-waters-manners-homelessness-071389">Politico</a>.</p>
