      <p>While you can make good money from forex trading, the trade has been referred to as "the most difficult way to make an easy living". Indeed, veterans and beginners alike blow their trading accounts occasionally.</p>
      <p>The good news is that while there will be losses along the way, there are ways to minimize losing events and the amounts lost per event.</p>
      <p>Here are some top trading mistakes to steer clear of.</p>
      <h3>Risking more than you can afford to lose</h3>
      <p>This places you in a desperate position which then pushes you to make <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/income-iq/emotional-investment-mistakes/"><u>emotional investment decisions</u></a>.</p>
      <p>Part of your trading strategy should be to look into the trading capital you have each day and then determining the maximum amount you can put in a single trade. This should be money budgeted specifically for trading.</p>
      <p>The rule of thumb is not to place anything more than 1% of your total capital per single trade.</p>
      <h3>Going all in</h3>
      <p>One frequent mistake traders make is going all in. This usually happens after a series of losses where you feel overly confident about making a 'recovery' trade.</p>
      <p>This is great if it works out. If it doesn't, it's disastrous and can blow your account.</p>
      <p>Go easy on recovery. If you have several bad losses in a row, the answer is to step away and reevaluate, not to double down or go full blast.</p>
      <h3>Trading blind</h3>
      <p>The emerging success stories on FX and its deceptive comparison to gambling has led many to believe that anyone can trade at any time. This is untrue.</p>
      <p>Successful traders have a few things in common; they learn and keep learning about the trade and keep abreast of forex information and analysis.</p>
      <p>One way to do this is by finding a reliable source of information such as the <a href="https://www.forex.academy/"><u>Forex Academy</u></a>. This is basically your one-stop shop for all things FX. From forex education to market updates to broker information, this site gives you all the resources you need to establish a lucrative trading career.</p>
      <h3>Wrong broker choices</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.topratedforexbrokers.com/uk/"><u>Finding a broker</u></a> and depositing trading capital is among the first steps you will take as an active trader. Making the wrong choices can put you out of the game long before you get the chance to make your first trade.</p>
      <p>You need to look at a few firms and do your due diligence to eliminate scams and firms facing financial woes.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, ask for referrals and look at company reviews and other credible sources of information that can inform on the health of prospective brokerage firms.</p>
      <h3>By-passing stop loss</h3>
      <p>In FX, stop loss is priceless. This is basically an order that gets you out of a trade if your option loses to your set margins, and mitigates your loss so can take a break from trade, or move on to your next trade.</p>
      <h3>Pumping more trading capital</h3>
      <p>Once you inject your initial capital, your trading kitty should ideally grow itself.</p>
      <p>If you are finding yourself continually replenishing your trading collateral without having made any withdrawals, you are in trouble.</p>
      <p>Again, you need to think of forex as a business. If you are constantly buying stocks and finding money elsewhere to keep your business afloat, then you are headed towards financial ruin; the same is true in FX. Set your strategy and work on making enough wins to keep you liquid.</p>
      <h3>Ultimately</h3>
      <p>While it has its intricacies, forex is an art you can master and perfect. Strive to remain updated, look out and avoid the major pitfalls, and have a clear plan and discipline; your efforts will ultimately pay off.</p>
      <p>Remember too, that your information will only be as good as its source. A reputable site such as Forex Academy is worth looking into as a long-term trading resource.</p>
