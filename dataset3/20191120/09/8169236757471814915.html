        <b>Liverpool are reportedly showing an interest in the potential transfer of Athletic Bilbao winger Iker Muniain after his fine recent form in La Liga.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has long looked a potentially big talent, but has not as of yet ended up landing himself a move to a bigger club.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/fichaje-sorpresa-quiere-jurgen-klopp-valverde-pidio-barca">Don Balon</a>, Barcelona have shown an interest in Muniain in the past, but he now looks set to be a summer target for Liverpool to strengthen in attack.</p>
      <p>The report states the Reds are expected to try an offer for the Spain international next summer, in what could be a smart move to replace the likes of Adam Lallana and Xherdan Shaqiri, who have not managed to establish themselves as regulars in Jurgen Klopp’s XI.</p>
      <p>Muniain is said to have a market value of around £13.5million, according to <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/iker-muniain/profil/spieler/54235">Transfermarkt</a>, though one imagines Liverpool may well have to pay a bit more than that to convince his club to let him go.</p>
      <p>LFC fans won’t exactly be desperate for new attacking players given the strength of their current crop of forwards and wingers, but depth is always useful for a top team challenging for as many as four trophies every season.</p>
