        <b>Paul Pogba’s twin found in Mzansi acting on Muvhango</b>
      </p>
      <p>Social Media never ceases to amaze and this time they have gone an extra mile by linking up MANCHESTER United’s midfielder Paul Pogba and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muvhango">Muvhango</a>’s Azwindini Mukhwevho who could be easily mistaken for siblings.</p>
      <p>Pogba plays for club Manchester United and internationally plays for France. Azwindini is a South African actor who plays as a chief in popular SABC 2 top soapie, Muvhango.</p>
      <p>Somewhere someone managed to notice the resemblance and social media has been awash with pic mix photos of the two. There is no photo of the two standing together.</p>
      <p>Mukwevho and Pogba’s striking resemblance has left many of their fans asking if they could be related…or it’s just a case of two people looking exactly like one another, and that’s all.</p>
      <p>Maybe they are family…do you agree with SunSport that the two celebrities do look alike?</p>

      <p>The BBC has confirmed that Jose Mourinho has been appointed Tottenham manager, succeeding Mauricio Pochettino who was sacked on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Mourinho has signed a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season.</p>
      <p>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me,” said the 56-year-old Portuguese. “Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
