      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/ozzy-osbourne-solo-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Ozzy Osbourne</a> is inviting fans to an online event tomorrow night at midnight.</p>
      <p>The vocalist <a href="https://straighttohell.ozzy.com/?fbclid=IwAR1yi0-DBZ5hFPSvn8wC1NzmkDgFWqIqwyiapez9Ni8ak319vBcLqqWqcPI">uploaded a postcard to his website</a>, simply saying: “You’re invited. Join me this Friday, November 22 at midnight. You’ll be going <i>Straight To Hell</i>.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/746465232487185/?active_tab=discussion">He also posted details of the event on Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>It looks like it's going to be the second single from Ozzy’s upcoming studio album <i>Ordinary Man</i>, with fans clicking on the postcard able to pre-save the track to either Spotify or Apple Music.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the former <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-sabbath-a-guide-to-their-best-albums">Black Sabbath</a> vocalist released the track <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-announces-new-album-ordinary-man-listen-to-first-single-under-the-graveyard"><i>Under The Graveyard</i></a> from his first solo album since 2010’s <i>Scream</i>.</p>
      <p>Ozzy is joined on the record by by <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/bikers-fire-hoses-and-looting-the-story-of-the-guns-n-roses-fan-riot-in-st-louis">Guns N’ Roses</a> bassist Duff McKagan, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/buyers-guide-how-to-buy-the-best-of-red-hot-chili-peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>’ drummer Chad Smith and former California Breed man Andrew Watt on guitar.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-will-make-his-live-comeback-in-november">Ozzy would make his live comeback at the American Music Awards</a> at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on November 24, where he’ll perform <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/listen-to-ozzy-osbournes-post-malone-collaboration-take-what-you-want"><i>Take What You Want</i></a> with Post Malone, Travis Scott and Andrew Watt.</p>
      <p>Ozzy was forced to postpone all of his 2019 touring plans after he was <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-hospitalised">hospitalised with pneumonia</a> and, as he was recovering, he fell at home, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/sharon-osbourne-describes-extent-of-ozzys-injuries-after-recent-fall">injuring his back, neck and shoulders – dislodging the metal rods he had inserted following his 2003 ATV accident in the process</a>.</p>
      <p>The live dates have now been <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-announces-rescheduled-no-more-tours-2-uk-and-european-dates">rescheduled and will take place throughout 2020</a>,</p>
