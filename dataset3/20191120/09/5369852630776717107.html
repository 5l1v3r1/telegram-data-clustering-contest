      <p>LEBRON JAMES BECAME the first player in NBA history to record a triple-double against every team in the league last night as the Los Angeles Lakers powered to victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>James finished with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a hard-fought 112-107 win over the Thunder at the Staples Center.</p>
      <p>Anthony Davis led the Lakers scoring with 34 points, while adding seven rebounds and four assists. </p>
      <p>The win saw the Lakers improve to 12-2 to remain on top of the Western Conference. But it was James’ 86th career triple-double that grabbed the headlines, the Lakers star sealing the milestone with an assist to Davis with just over four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>James said the record would not have been possible without the support of coaches and team-mates over the years.</p>
      <p>“I really don’t know what to think about it to be honest,” James told reporters when asked about the feat.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had some great team-mates and great coaches who’ve put me in position to facilitate. My team-mates have made shots for me throughout my career, coaches have put me in position to be successful. </p>
      <blockquote>Hopefully in all those triple-doubles I’ve got a winning record because that’s what’s most important. But it’s a pretty cool stat and I’m glad it happened.”</blockquote>
      <p>Houston’s Russell Westbrook is hard on James’ heels with triple-doubles against 29 of the league’s 30 teams. </p>
      <p>Westbrook would complete his set with a triple-double against his former team Oklahoma City, who he left this year.</p>

      <p>In New Orleans, Carmelo Anthony made an unsuccessful return to the NBA after more than a year out of the game as the Portland Trail Blazers slumped to a 115-104 loss to the Pelicans.</p>
      <p>Anthony, whose move to Portland was confirmed by the team just yesterday, finished with 10 points after 23 minutes on court after shooting just 4-of-14 from the field.</p>
      <p>It was a largely frustrating night for the 35-year-old 10-time All-Star, with Portland giving up 17 turnovers as the Pelicans dominated a shaky Blazers defense.</p>
      <p>Anthony however was simply happy to have made his return to the league, just over a year after he was released from the Houston Rockets.</p>

      <p>“It was cool. “I just enjoyed being back out there, getting into the flow of things, the routines, putting the uniform on and getting up and down the court.”</p>
      <p>Jrue Holiday led the scoring for the Pelicans with 22 points while Brandon Ingram had 21 points off the bench.</p>

      <p>In Memphis, the crisis-hit Golden State Warriors ended a seven-game losing streak with a comfortable road victory over the Grizzlies, winning 114-95.</p>
      <p>Although the Warriors continue to prop up the Western Conference standings with three wins against 12 defeats, the Dubs’ injury-ravaged line-up drew confidence from a deserved win.</p>
      <p>Alec Burks finished with 29 points while Glenn Robinson III had 20 points as the Warriors scored a morale-boosting victory.</p>
