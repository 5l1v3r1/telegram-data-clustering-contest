      <p>The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday (today) in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Also, the ruling party has fixed its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting for Friday, which has been confirmed by President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the APC’s emergency meeting was aimed at setting agenda for the National Caucus meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to a top member of the party, the NWC meeting “is strategic” as it would lay the foundation for deliberations at the caucus meeting.</p>
      <p>He also said that vacant leadership positions in the party are also expected to be on the front burner as new occupants could emerge this week subject to ratification by the NEC.</p>
      <p>Another NWC member said that zonal chairmen had been asked to come with the names of candidates for the vacant positions in their zones for deliberation first at the NWC meeting, then at the caucus meeting.</p>
      <p>“The positions have been zoned and micro-zoned to states but we have a situation that lobbying has been intense to jettison the arrangement so the caucus is playing a key role in the final outcome before the ratification by the NEC,” the part member said.</p>
