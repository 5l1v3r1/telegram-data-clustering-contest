      <p>TAKE in ocean and golf course views while walking a purpose-built trail in City Beach.</p>
      <p>The Town of Cambridge officially opened the 3.4km City Beach north walking trail loop on November 19.</p>
      <p>The trail runs from Empire Village Shopping Centre in City Beach and can be walked in sections with stops at restaurants, cafes and parks along the way.</p>
      <p>Cambridge Mayor Keri Shannon said the Town received public requests to develop local walking trails, which resulted in its Walking Strategy 2018-21.</p>
      <p>“The purpose of the strategy was to identify trails that would link natural areas and activity centres, and be accessible to people of all abilities,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The Town’s natural assets and cultural heritage offer great reasons for walking, plus it’s a wonderful way for community members to keep physically active and socially connected.”</p>
      <p>Seats and water fountains are being installed along the pathway this year and directional and interpretive signage will follow in the next financial year.</p>
      <p>A large map and path markers at the southern side of the shopping centre indicate the start of the trail, which runs north along The Boulevard.</p>
