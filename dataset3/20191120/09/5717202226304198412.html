      <p>It has been a remarkable 24 hours for Spurs. From the outside, it has appeared that Pochettino’s departure has been on the cards for some time. Nevertheless, the timing of his exit left many stunned.</p>

      <p>And it has not taken long for Tottenham to appoint his successor. <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-head-coach/">The club announced on Wednesday morning</a> that Jose Mourinho has been appointed until the end of the 2022/23 season.</p>
      <p>All of the announcements may have come in quick succession. But it would appear that the writing had been on the wall for some time before Pochettino’s exit was confirmed.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/exclusive-jose-mourinho-eyes-tottenham-job-following-mauricio/">The Telegraph reports</a> that Levy had asked the former Southampton boss to resign last week. However, Pochettino refused, leaving the Spurs chief with no choice but to sack him.</p>
      <h3>TBR View – A sad end to a brilliant tenure</h3>
      <p>Pochettino’s critics will gladly point out that he leaves Spurs having not won a trophy with the club. However, his tenure deserves to be remembered as a fantastic chapter in Tottenham’s history.</p>
      <p>It so nearly culminated in Spurs reaching the summit in Europe. And they were certainly key players in the Premier League title race on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>It is sad that his tenure has ended in this way. And if Mourinho goes on to enjoy success with Spurs, then the portion of the praise should certainly go to the man who he took over from.</p>
