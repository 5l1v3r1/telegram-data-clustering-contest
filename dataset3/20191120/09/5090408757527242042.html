        <li>A mile-long road in London has been the city’s “Billionaires Row” since World War II: a destination for luxury, scandal, murder, and secrecy.</li>
        <li>The newspaper baron Richard Desmond has lived on The Bishops Avenue since 2004, one of very few residents to own a home under his own name.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.insider.com/inside-london-billionaires-row-property-interactive-2019-11">This post is part of an interactive Insider series profiling Billionaires Row.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In 1966, Richard Desmond quit school in north London at the age of 15 to become a drummer.</p>
      <p>In May 2019, the now-67-year-old has a mansion on The Bishops Avenue – London’s Billionaires Row – and commands a personal fortune estimated around $1 billion.</p>
      <p>Desmond lives in a mansion called Dane Court, one of the avenue’s 66 properties.</p>
      <p>Desmond is the owner of Northern &amp; Shell, once a giant of UK media which published the UK’s Daily Express and Daily Star newspapers until their sale last year.</p>

      <p>As the media business went sour, Desmond sold off Britain’s Channel 5 TV station, his newspapers, as well as celebrity magazines like OK! and New, pivoting his company to property and gambling.</p>
      <p>Desmond bought Dane Court, a neo-Jacobean mansion, for £9.2 million ($14 million) in 2004.</p>
      <p>It is one of 40% of the mansions on the road registered to a named person rather than a shell corporation.</p>

      <p>Desmond is famous in the UK for being the nation’s first “porn baron.”</p>
      <p>In the 1980s, his early magazines had names like International Musician and Home Organist but these soon gave way to Asian Babes, Forty Plus, and Posh Housewives.</p>

      <p>In 1982, Desmond bought the UK license for the x-rated US TV channel Penthouse. He controlled it until 1991.</p>
      <p>In his autobiography “The Real Deal” Desmond called the decision “nine years of grief,” as Penthouse’s US founder Bob Gucci transpired to be a terrible business partner.</p>
      <p>Desmond also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/feb/17/pressandpublishing.dailyexpress">received death threats from John Gotti’s “Gambino” crime family</a> when a porn advertising scam they hoped to run through Desmond’s magazines collapsed around them.</p>
      <p>The Gambinos planned to put dodgy adverts in Desmond’s porn magazines, but the deal collapsed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/feb/17/pressandpublishing.dailyexpress">according to FBI testimony used in the Gambino trial.</a></p>
      <p>Satirists at Private Eye magazine dubbed Desmonds “Dirty Des.”</p>

      <p>Desmond sold off his x-rated magazine titles for £20 million($36 million) in 2004, the same year he bought Dane Court.</p>
      <p>Desmond also bought a second property on The Bishops Avenue, Fairways, which became the most expensive new-build home in the UK after it was listed for £22 million ($28 million) in 2014.</p>
      <p>Details of Dane Court’s interior are not easy to come by. However, Desmond’s unusual style in his company boardroom has been well-documented.</p>
      <p>He gets bananas delivered by his butler on a silver tray, rings a bell in meetings when someone makes a good point, and blows an old-fashioned car horn when it’s bad, <a href="https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/mt-interview-richard-desmond/article/1042695">Management Today reported.</a></p>
      <p>Desmond declined to comment for this article through a representative.</p>
