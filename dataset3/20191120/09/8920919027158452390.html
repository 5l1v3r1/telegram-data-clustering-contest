      <h1>Google To Limit Targeting of Political Ads</h1>

      <p>Google said on Wednesday that it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-advertising/google-changes-election-ads-policy-to-limit-targeting-idUSKBN1XU2WT">will stop giving advertisers the ability to target election ads</a> using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations. Reuters reports: <i>Google said on Wednesday it would start limiting audience targeting for election ads to age, gender and general location at a postal code level. Previously, verified political advertisers could also target ads using data such as whether the users were left-leaning, right-leaning or independent. Google said political advertisers can still do contextual targeting, such as serving ads to people reading a certain story or watching a particular video. <br/><br/>The company will begin enforcing the new approach in the United Kingdom within a week, ahead of the country's general election on Dec. 12. It said it would begin enforcing it in the European Union by the end of the year and in the rest of the world starting on Jan. 6, 2020. "Given recent concerns and debates about political advertising, and the importance of shared trust in the democratic process, we want to improve voters' confidence in the political ads they may see on our ad platforms," Scott Spencer, vice president of product management for Google Ads, said in the blog post. Google added examples to its misrepresentation policy to show that it would not allow false claims about election results or the eligibility of political candidates. Google also added examples to its ad policies to clarify that it prohibits doctored and manipulated media.</i></p>
