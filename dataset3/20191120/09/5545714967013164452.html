      <p>We've had some tricky game names hitting the market recently. <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-gylt-572367.phtml">Gylt</a></i>? More like <i>Gilt</i> or <i>Guilt</i>. <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-572597.phtml">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a></i>? More like <i>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order</i>.</p>
      <p>Speaking of <i>Fallen Order</i>, it's a pretty great Jedi simulator, but it has a lot of technical issues. Those problems are less annoying on PC, but for good measure Respawn has deployed a patch that squashes a few bugs and generally improves performance across the board. In addition to fixing a flickering issue with the main driving sequence (being as vague as possible, don't read the notes below if you want to know), as well as arrow key input bugs. But the main events are dynamic resolution settings retention, as well as "an issue where the game could become slow and loading times [were] longer than expected."</p>
      <p>Respawn says that the developer "has a patch that will follow on Xbox One and PS4, due out this week," and it can't come soon enough. Although I did hit some performance problems when testing out the PC version the Xbox One and PS4 editions need the most love, especially base Xbox One and PS4 hardware. Hopefully this is just one of several updates intended to bring the game up to snuff on a technical level, for the good of the legacy of the game.</p>
