        <li>A mile-long road in London has been the city’s “Billionaire’s Row” since the World War II: a destination for luxury, scandal, murder, and secrecy.</li>
        <li>Insider has profiled key residents of The Bishops Avenue in a series of articles after revealing that the vast majority of mansions on the street are owned by shell corporations.</li>
        <li>In 2016 Justin Bieber was on his iconic “Purpose” tour. His base for the UK dates was Heath Hall, a £25 million ($32 million,) 27,000 sq-ft mansion on The Bishops Avenue.</li>

          <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-london-billionaires-row-property-interactive-2019-11">This post is part of an interactive series by Insider profiling Billionaires Row.</a>

      </ul>
      <p>On October 12, 2016, schoolkids at Highgate School, a distinguished private school with playing fields at the end of The Bishops Avenue, were midway through soccer training when two figures strode across the grass.</p>
      <p>The larger was one of the world’s most successful talent managers, Scooter Braun, the other was Justin Bieber.</p>
      <p>Bieber was on the UK leg of the world tour for his album “Purpose,” with UK stops in London, Manchester, Glasgow, and Birmingham – his base for which was Heath Hall, located at 59 The Bishops Avenue.</p>
      <p>That morning Bieber approached games master Mario Noto and asked him to join in. “He asked me to go in goal for a few penalties – and turned out to be pretty good,” Noto said.</p>
      <p>Highgate School’s sports department tweeted some pictures at the time.</p>

      <p>The area went into meltdown.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit confusing at the beginning cause everyone just thought he was a random year 11,” a pupil told the London’s Heart Radio that afternoon.</p>
      <p>“They just thought someone just wanted to come and join in, until they saw all the tattoos on the neck.”</p>
      <p>The 27,000 sq-ft mansion Bieber rented lies on 2.5 acres on the west side of The Bishops Avenue, and is considered one of the more tasteful mansions on the street.</p>

      <p>The original home on the plot – East Weald – was built in 1919 for British sugar tycoon William Lyle. It was bought in 2006 by British property developer Andreas Panayiotou, who renamed the house and spent £40 million ($54 million) modernizing it.</p>
      <p>East Weald had also been used as hostel-come-residence for Chinese government employees posted to London.</p>
      <p>One thing missing from the original mansion when Panayiotou bought it were the home’s famous iron gates, which had been commandeered during World War II to make tanks.</p>

      <p>The £40 million Panayiotou spent on modernizing the interior made it unrecognizable.</p>
      <p>One of the Hall’s 13 bathrooms now holds a £250,000 ($320,000) bathtub made of pure onyx. Installing it required the floor be especially reinforced, Trevor Abrahmsohn, the agent who sold the property to Panayiotou, told Insider.</p>
      <p>In March 2013, upon seeing the house again up for sale, British author A. N. Wilson <a href="https://www.pressreader.com/uk/scottish-daily-mail/20130320/281947425293800">wrote</a> that Panayiotou had clearly contracted “gold taps syndrome” on account of how lavish it was.</p>
      <p>Panayiotou first listed the property with Abrahamshon’s Glentree Estates in 2012 for £100 million ($130 million)</p>
      <p>Feeling flush at the potential returns, he ordered glossy, hard-back brochures costing £2,000 ($2,600) each.</p>
      <p>But he was out of luck. The price was routinely lowered until it was sold for £25 million ($32 million) in April 2015.</p>

      <p>When Bieber rented Health Hall he paid £108,000 ($140,000) a month.</p>
      <p>What he did in the home is not well known. But with a tennis court, indoor and outdoor swimming pool, steam room, sauna, gym, home cinema, and 600-bottle wine cellar, he was not short of options.</p>
      <p>Upon hearing of Bieber’s new digs on The Bishops Avenue, newspaper columnist Giles Coren said it was “absolutely the worst street in London, and probably the world.”</p>

      <p>“Bieber, you poor little muffin,” Coren <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/welcome-to-the-wasteland-of-wealth-mr-bieber-qf808vglt">wrote in his column for The Times of London</a>. “You will kill yourself if you have to stay there for more than a week.”</p>
      <p>The property does have a panic room.</p>
      <p>After Bieber wrapped up the UK leg of the “Purpose” tour on October 30, 2016, he left Heath Hall, rending the house again unoccupied for a year, until US actress Salma Hayek and husband François-Henri Pinault rented it in November 2017.</p>
      <p>Heath Hall is currently registered to Heath Investments Limited.</p>
