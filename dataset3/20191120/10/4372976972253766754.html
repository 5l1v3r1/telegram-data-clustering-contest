      <p>NEW YORK â€” A federal appeals court said <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">General Motors</a> is not liable for punitive damages over accidents that occurred after its 2009 bankruptcy and involved vehicles it produced earlier, including vehicles with faulty ignition switches.</p>
      <p>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said on Tuesday that the automaker did not agree to contractually assume liability for punitive damages as part of its federally-backed Chapter 11 reorganization.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">GM</a> filed for bankruptcy in June 2009, and its best assets were transferred to a new Detroit-based company with the same name. The other assets and many liabilities stayed with "Old GM," which is also known as Motors Liquidation Co.</p>
      <p>Tuesday's 3-0 decision may help GM reduce its ultimate exposure in nationwide litigation over defective ignition switches in several <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/pontiac/">Pontiac</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/saturn/">Saturn</a> models.</p>
      <p>It is also a defeat for drivers involved in post-bankruptcy accidents, including those who collided with older GM vehicles driven by others, as well as their law firms.</p>
      <p>The ignition switch defect could cause engine stalls and keep <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/airbag/">airbags</a> from deploying, and has been linked to 124 deaths.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for the drivers and their law firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment. GM had no comment.</p>
      <p>Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said GM's agreement to acquire assets "free and clear" of most liabilities excused it from punitive damages claims for Old GM's conduct.</p>
      <p>He also noted that the judge who oversaw the bankruptcy concluded that the new company could not be liable for claims that the "deeply insolvent" Old GM would never have paid.</p>
      <p>The decision upheld a May 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan, who oversees the ignition switch litigation.</p>
      <p>Drivers have sought a variety of damages in that litigation, including for declining resale values.</p>
      <p>GM has <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/recalls/">recalled</a> more than 2.6 million vehicles since 2014 over ignition switch problems.</p>
      <p>It has also paid more than $2.6 billion in related penalties and settlements, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case.</p>
      <p>The case is In re: Motors Liquidation Co, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-1940.</p>
