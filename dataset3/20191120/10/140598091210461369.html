      <p>This fish recipe makes a delicious dinner for four. Grilled cod is served with coco de paimpol beans and buttered, toasted breadcrumbs.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 45 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Olive oil, for frying and greasing</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 stick of celery, diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>50g pancetta, chopped</li>
        <li>300g fresh coco beans</li>
        <li>4 x 150g cod fillets, skin on [I cut one filleted piece into 150g portions]</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>100g panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>½ tsp chopped thyme leaves</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Add a touch of olive oil to a pan and sweat the diced vegetables with the garlic for five minutes until they start to get soft but not coloured. Add the pancetta and cook for a further two minutes then remove from the heat and tie the contents of the pan into a muslin cloth. Leave to one side.</li>
        <li>Place the coco beans in a clean pan and cover with cold water. Add the muslin bundle and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook until the beans are soft but not mushy, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grease a baking tray with oil and place the cod pieces skin-side down. Grill for five to eight minutes until cooked through. The best way to tell is to gently push the thin handle of a kitchen spoon through the flesh of one of the fillets; if the flesh shows no resistance, it is cooked.</li>
        <li>Open the muslin cloth and add everything to the beans in the pan. There should still be enough liquid to form a nice ragou. Keep warm and stir through the parsley.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pan and stir through the breadcrumbs and thyme. Toast until golden brown. Stir in the lemon zest. </li>
        <li>Dived the coco beans between warm dishes and place cod fillets on top. Finish with the toasted breadcrumbs.</li>
      </ol>
