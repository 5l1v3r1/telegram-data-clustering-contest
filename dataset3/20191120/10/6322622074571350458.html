      <h1>Vietnam leads declines as most markets slide on trade tensions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:23:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(Nov 20): Most Southeast Asian markets slipped on Wednesday on fears that strained Sino-US relations could derail trade negotiations after US President Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs and the US Senate passed a bill backing Hong Kong protesters.</p>
      <p>President Trump on Tuesday said that tariffs on Chinese imports would be increased if the two nations fail to reach a trade deal.</p>
      <p>People familiar with the talks say that Trump has decided that any tariff rollbacks from the United States would require deeper concessions from China.</p>
      <p>The US Senate, meanwhile, has passed a bill aimed at protecting human rights of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, drawing a rebuke from Beijing, which asked the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs.</p>
      <p>"Such a move threatens to drive a wedge into ongoing US-China negotiations while potentially raising the barrier to a trade deal," FXTM market analyst Han Tan said in a note, referring to the bill.</p>
      <p>Leading declines, Vietnamese shares fell 0.8% to their lowest close since Oct 31, with financials weighing on the index.</p>
      <p>A steep drop in oil prices drove the Thai index 0.7% lower, with heavyweight energy company PTT PCL shedding as much as 2.3% to close at its lowest in more than two months.</p>
      <p>Philippines stocks clawed back losses to end 0.2% down, hurt by miner Semirara Mining and Power Corp, which fell 6.6% for its biggest daily drop since November last year.</p>
      <p>Its majority owner DMCI Holdings shed 8.4% to its lowest closing level in nearly eight years.</p>
      <p>Semirara flagged significant loss in production potential because of a Department of Energy directive asking it to suspend all mining activities in relation to a coal contract, citing a mudflow incident in October.</p>
      <p>Malaysian shares shed 0.3%, with power utility Tenaga Nasional falling 0.7% and telecoms company Axiata Group down 1.4%.</p>
      <p>The index pared losses after data showed Malaysia's consumer prices grew by 1.1% in October, slightly higher than a 1% increase forecast by <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>Mild inflation in recent times and sluggish economic growth in the third quarter, combined with a slump in exports and mining, have fuelled expectations of a rate cut by Malaysia's central bank early next year.</p>
