        <b>MasterChef: The Professionals finalist and restaurant owner Dean Banks has launched a new premium Scottish gin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lunun is said to benefit from the “single-fold” distillation process used to create it while its taste has been developed with the chef’s palette in mind.</p>
      <p>The new gin has been influenced by Banks’ travels to more than 40 different countries and his expertise in fusion cooking.</p>
      <p>Distilled in the chef’s home town of Arbroath, the gin’s name is an adaptation of Lunan Bay. The product will be distributed using eco-friendly packaging.</p>
      <p>Banks said: “I’ve always wanted to create my own gin and it seems like the next natural step for me after establishing my restaurant in St Andrews.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to create something that people judge solely on the taste and not the ‘hype’ that often comes with contemporary artisan gins – in fact, Lunun is the opposite to an artisan gin. There’s no smoke and mirrors with Lunun.”</p>
