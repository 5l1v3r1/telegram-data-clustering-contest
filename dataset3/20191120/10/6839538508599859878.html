      <p>Horse jumping is getting a metropolitan backdrop as the unique sporting event shifts from valley to Victoria Park.</p>
      <p>In a bid to attract socialites and punters to a different kind of horse sport, the sixth year of the Pearllargo Equestrian in the Park event is poised to be its biggest yet, thanks in part to Mark Hutchings’ celebrity clout.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably the only show jumping event that’s really brought into the city throughout the year ... in and around the city for people who don’t often get to see it,” Hutchings told AAA.</p>
      <p>The West Coast Eagle will be the spectator this time as event ambassador, something not evenPerth’s Melbourne Cup festivities featured, enjoying the suiting one last time before swapping trousers for footy shorts.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a nice break, I went to LA for just under two weeks and went to Melbourne for the spring racing carnival, so it’s been good,” Hutchings said.</p>
      <p>The event takes place on the Victoria Park foreshore on Saturday, November 30, and while Hutchings might be “itching” to get back into training and footy after 11 weeks, he hasn’t ruled out a few of his teammates making an appearance.</p>
      <p>“It’s a couple of days before our first training session so they won’t be getting too loose,” he said.</p>
      <p>The event attracts a field of international competitors and Olympians, and plenty of marquees.</p>
      <p>“There’s food trucks, plenty of drinks around the showjumping course, and it’s sort of just constant action throughout the day,” Hutchings said.</p>
      <p>“There’s always a horse going round the jumps and yeah you can kind of just move in and out of the action, and it’s good you can bring a few friends along, have a few drinks.”</p>
