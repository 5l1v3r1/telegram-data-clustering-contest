      <p><b>FUKUOKA – </b>Hakuho took another step toward his record-extending 43rd top-level championship with a victory over Ryuden at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Mongolian-born yokozuna maintained his outright lead, improving to 10-1 as he forced out the No. 5 maegashira in the final bout of Day 11 at Fukuoka Kokusai Center.</p>
      <p>Eschewing his trademark face slap, Hakuho immediately took Ryuden’s belt with his left hand and maneuvered him back toward the edge while securing a double outside grip. From there, Ryuden (4-7) was powerless to stop the all-time championship record holder from forcing him over the straw.</p>
      <p>Komusubi Asanoyama remained Hakuho’s closest rival at the 15-day tournament, improving to 9-2 against No. 3 Takarafuji (4-7).</p>
      <p>The winner of the Summer Basho opened with a hard charge and maintained his momentum, easily shoving Takarafuji out despite being denied a belt hold.</p>
      <p>The lone competing ozeki, Takakeisho, claimed a winning record and retained an outside chance for the title with an easy push-out victory over No. 5 Aoiyama.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old powerhouse improved to 8-3 as he quickly overwhelmed Bulgarian Aoiyama (5-6) with a pushing and thrusting attack.</p>
      <p>Sekiwake Mitakeumi saw his hopes of an ozeki promotion take another hit following a force-out loss to komusubi Endo.</p>
      <p>Mitakeumi (5-6) had the momentum in the initial collision but Endo (5-6) countered with a shallow grip, holding his ground before using his leverage to drive out the two-time tournament winner.</p>
      <p>Komusubi Abi fell to 6-5, succumbing to a slap down against No. 1 Okinoumi (5-6).</p>
      <p>Okinoumi shoved Abi off balance at the jump, then knocked the komusubi down before he had a chance to launch his favored thrusting attack.</p>
      <p>Komusubi Hokutofuji (4-7) moved to the brink of a losing record after dropping a hard-fought bout against No. 2 Myogiryu (5-6).</p>
      <p>Hokutofuji went in straight and hard, knocking Myogiryu back to the edge, but the 33-year-old veteran kept his composure and resisted a second force out attempt before battling back to the center and thrusting the komusubi down.</p>
      <p>No. 10 Shodai (8-3), who was unbeaten through Day 4, secured a winning record by dumping out No. 8 Sadanoumi (6-5).</p>
      <p>“Being able to get a winning record in the final tournament of the year means I can end the year on a high note,” the Tokitsukaze stable grappler said.</p>
      <p>“Overall, I’m able to put a lot of pressure on my opponents and it will be good if I can keep it up. I want to go as far as I can in the championship race.”</p>
      <p>No. 13 Kagayaki (8-3) also captured an all-important eighth victory, pushing out No. 7 Tsurugisho (5-6) to ensure his first winning record in four tournaments.</p>
