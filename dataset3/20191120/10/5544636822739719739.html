      <p>The Federal Government has queried the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) over the country’s performances at major competitions.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the Minister of Sports and Youth Development Sunday Dare met the NFF on Monday over the poor showing of the national teams.</p>
      <p>The Super Falcons, as well as the U-23 Eagles, will not take part in the football event of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after failing to qualify for the sporting event.</p>
      <p>Nigeria failed to make it past the Group B of the Africa U-23 Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt which serves as the qualifier for Tokyo 2020.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the female team were beaten by Ivory Coast in the qualifying game for the biggest sporting event.</p>
      <p>Also, Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets, six-time winners, were knocked out of the U-17 World Cup 2019 in the second round by The Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Earlier in June, the Golden Eaglets stumbled into the Round of 16 at the 2019 U-20 World Cup before crashing out.</p>
      <p>In October, the Super Eagles Team B failed to qualify for the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN) after Togo defeated them.</p>
      <p>These developments have left the Nigerian government concerned with Dare asking the NFF to explain why the country’s teams have performed woefully this year.</p>
      <p>The meeting was attended by the NFF President Amaju Pinnick, First Vice-President Seyi Akinwunmi, second Vice-President Shehu Dikko and General Secretary Mohammed Sanusi.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday I led the Ministry of Youth and Sports in a meeting with the NFF,” Dare tweeted.</p>
      <p>“A single agenda meeting: to provide an explanation to the country as to why we suffered several failures recently – towards taking appropriate and far-reaching steps to improve Nigerian football.”</p>
