      <p>Stephen Colbert is a big fan of the latest witness in the ongoing impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>For the third day of the hearings, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman took to the stand to give his testimony â€” and a clip of his opening statement drew a round of applause from <i>The Late Show</i> audience.</p>
      <p>"That is beautiful," says Colbert, after watching Vindman reassuring his father, who fled the Soviet Union to come to the U.S., that he'll be fine for telling the truth. "But you know it's really going to enrage Trump," adds Colbert, "'cuz it features his two least favorite things: immigrants, and fathers who love their sons."</p>
      <p>Colbert spends the rest of the segment rounding up some of Vindman's best clap backs, including the time he crisply corrected Republican Devin Nunes after he called Vindman "Mr" instead of "Lt. Col."</p>
      <p>Boom.</p>
