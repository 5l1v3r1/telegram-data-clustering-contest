      <p>I've made an argument for <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/05/the-clone-wars-is-the-prequel-star-wars-deserves/">why you should watch The Clone Wars</a>, but actually watching it is another thing. With 121 episodes, many of them filler, some of them oddly out of order, there's a certain art to getting the best out of your Clone Wars experience. Here's my list of the essential episodes you should be watching, neatly sorted into chronological order and cut down to only 66 episodes and a movie.</p>
      <p>
        <i>This story originally appeared in January 2018, and has been retimed following the launch of Disney+ in Australia.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>The Clone Wars theatrical release</h3>
      <p>The movie tells the story of Ahsoka becoming an unwilling Anakin's padawan — while the plot itself is nothing groundbreaking, it's a good start to the relationship between the two. It's the only one that's not on Netflix, so it's worth hunting down first.</p>

      <h3>S3E01: Clone Cadets</h3>
      <p>The first episode of season 3, Clone Cadets introduces a handful of the clones that we follow through the series, all the way through to Season 6. Seeing as they all essentially look the same, it's good to get a feel for them early.</p>
      <h3>S1E05: Rookies</h3>
      <p>Oh look, here are those clones again.</p>
      <h3>S1E09: Cloak of Darkness</h3>
      <p>As we're skipping the underwhelming first episode, this is a good one to introduce Dooku and his apprentice, Asajj Ventress.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>S1E12: Lair of Grievous</h3>
      <p>Another one that focuses on the baddies, you won't find many of the recurring main characters here, but the dark side machinations are still interesting.</p>
      <h3>S1E19: Storm over Ryloth</h3>
      <h3>S1E20: Innocents of Ryloth</h3>
      <h3>S1E21: Liberty on Ryloth</h3>
      <p>This three-parter is both the start of some deeper character development for Ahsoka and a bit more adventure for the clones. One of the characters in this arc is also pretty important if you're planning on watching Rebels later.</p>
      <h3>S2E01: Holocron Heist</h3>
      <h3>S2E02: Cargo of Doom</h3>
      <h3>S2E03: Children of the Force</h3>
      <p>Another three-parter that introduces bounty hunter Cad Bane and further builds on the relationship between Ahsoka and Anakin.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2016/05/holocronheist.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>S2E18: The Zillo Beast</h3>
      <h3>S2E19: The Zillo Beast Strikes Back</h3>
      <p>Some people love the Zillo Beast episodes, some people hate them. For me, they're memorable enough to be worth an inclusion.</p>
      <h3>S2E05: Landing at Point Rain</h3>
      <h3>S2E06: Weapons Factory</h3>
      <p>This two-parter introduces padawan Barriss Offee — who eventually becomes Ahsoka's friend. It also provides a broader view of the Clone Wars themselves, and includes a little about the relationships between Jedi and their padawans.</p>
      <h3>S2E07: Legacy of Terror</h3>
      <h3>S2E08: Brain Invaders</h3>
      <p>Another two-parter that leads on from Weapons Factory, this arc is about brain-invading zombie worms. Other than that, it's mainly worth watching for the moments between Ahsoka and Barriss.</p>
      <h3>S2E12: The Mandalore Plot</h3>
      <h3>S2E13: Voyage of Temptation</h3>
      <h3>S2E14: Duchess of Mandalore</h3>
      <p>The Mandalore arc introduces Obi Wan's ex-girlfriend, Satine, who happens to be the Duchess of Mandalore — yes, that place with the armour where Boba Fett comes from. Except for some reason they're pacifists. A good start to the developing Mandalore storyline throughout the series.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>S2E20: Death Trap</h3>
      <h3>S2E21: R2 Come Home</h3>
      <h3>S2E22: Lethal Trackdown</h3>
      <p>These episodes follow young Boba Fett as he sets out to get revenge on Mace Windu — the Jedi who killed his father. Featuring other bounty hunters from the Star Wars canon such as Bossk from Empire Strikes Back and Aurra Sing, the bald, pale bounty hunter with a short cameo in The Phantom Menace.</p>
      <h3>S3E02: ARC Troopers</h3>
      <p>This episode continues the story of the clones from Clone Cadets and Rookies — well, some of them, at least.</p>
      <h3>S1E22: Hostage Crisis</h3>
      <h3>S3E09: Hunt for Ziro</h3>
      <p>While this Hutt subplot is a little odd (though more so when watched in its original order) it's also more screentime for Cad Bane, and a look at Quinlan Vos, one of the more entertaining members of the Jedi order.</p>
      <h3>S3E10: Heroes on Both Side</h3>
      <h3>S3E11: Pursuit of Peace</h3>
      <p>This two-parter is a heavily political one, where Padmé tries to broker peace between the Senate and the Separatists. While it might not appeal to everyone, it's an interesting depiction of grey morality in a universe that loves its blacks and whites.</p>
      <h3>S3E12: Nightsisters</h3>
      <h3>S3E13: Monster</h3>
      <h3>S3E14: Witches of the Mist</h3>
      <p>A three-parter that expands on Asajj Ventress, Dooku being a dick and gives us a peek at Darth Maul's people and home planet.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>
        <i><b>On Mortis:</b> Episodes 15-17 of Season 3 make up the Mortis arc, set on a mysterious planet that exists within the Force. This arc deals with Anakin's role as the 'chosen one' in a less than subtle way, and while I think this arc weakens a lot of other Star Wars lore surrounding the Force and Anakin's prophecy, many Star Wars fans would disagree. Ultimately it's up to you to watch or skip!</i>
      </p>
      <h3>S3E18: The Citadel</h3>
      <h3>S3E19: Counter Attack</h3>
      <h3>S3E20: Citadel Rescue</h3>
      <p>Anakin and Tarkin become bros in one of the series' few nods to the original trilogy. Things also get pretty intense during this high-stakes prison break in/out arc.</p>
      <h3>S4E07: Darkness on Umbara</h3>
      <h3>S4E08: The General</h3>
      <h3>S4E09: Plan of Dissent</h3>
      <h3>S4E10: Carnage of Krell</h3>
      <p>A series of clone-centric episodes that have some very illuminating things to say about the state of the Jedi Order. Again, an indicator of the darker direction the series takes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2016/05/darknessonumbara.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>S4E14: A Friend In Need</h3>
      <p>This episode re-introduces Ahsoka's low-key love interest, Lux Bonteri, as well as being the first appearance of Satine's sister and important Death Watch member Bo-Katan Kryze.</p>
      <h3>S4E15: Deception</h3>
      <h3>S4E16: Friends and Enemies</h3>
      <h3>S4E17: The Box</h3>
      <h3>S4E18: Crisis on Naboo</h3>
      <p>Obi Wan goes undercover with a group of bounty hunters. A lot of it is just him showing off, but the culmination of the arc is a surprisingly intense moment born of Palpatine's plotting.</p>
      <h3>S4E19: Massacre</h3>
      <h3>E4E20: Bounty</h3>
      <p>Two episodes that continue Asajj Ventress's increasingly interesting plotline, as she leaves the dark side behind to form her own morality.</p>
      <h3>S4E21: Brothers</h3>
      <h3>S4E22: Revenge</h3>
      <p>A very surprising return from a film character who really deserved more screen time.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2016/05/brothers.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>S5E02: A War on Two Fronts</h3>
      <h3>S5E03: Front Runners</h3>
      <h3>S5E04: The Soft War</h3>
      <h3>S5E05: Tipping Points</h3>
      <p>Ahsoka is sent to train a group of insurgent rebels. Wait, is that really something that's okay for the Jedi to do? Well, apparently yes...</p>
      <h3>S5E01: Revival</h3>
      <h3>S5E14: Eminence</h3>
      <h3>S5E15: Shades of Reason</h3>
      <h3>S5E16: The Lawless</h3>
      <p>Darth Maul and his brother have some really crazy plans for the world of Mandalore, deciding to capitalise on all that Sith training he has to build a criminal empire. Things get really crazy as the Mandalore plotline winds up.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2016/05/CWAhsokaAnakin.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>S5E17: Sabotage</h3>
      <h3>S5E18: The Jedi Who Knew Too Much</h3>
      <h3>S5E19: To Catch a Jedi</h3>
      <h3>S5E20: The Wrong Jedi</h3>
      <p>These four episodes are the culmination of Ahsoka's storyline in The Clone Wars, and a really powerful ending to the series (nevermind that there are episodes after it) The sixth season was produced just for Netflix, and mainly consists of tying up previously unclear plot points:</p>
      <h3>S6E01: The Unknown</h3>
      <h3>S6E02: Conspiracy</h3>
      <h3>S6E03: Fugitive</h3>
      <h3>S6E04: Orders</h3>
      <p>"Wait, so if the clones are so loyal to the Jedi, why did Order 66 happen?"</p>
      <h3>S6E10: The Lost One</h3>
      <p>"What happened to that Master Sifo-Dyas guy anyway?"</p>
      <h3>S6E11: Voices</h3>
      <h3>S6E12: Destiny</h3>
      <h3>S6E13: Sacrifice</h3>
      <p>"Why are there so many Force ghosts in the original trilogy but none in the prequels?"</p>
