        <b>A DRUG pusher’s social media is still offering deals - even though he’s locked up after supplying fatal ecstasy.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4945992/kilmarnock-codey-robson-boyfriend-guilty-car/">Lewis Reid</a>, 22, sold crystallised MDMA to pals of <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4968210/lewis-reid-chelsea-bruce-codey-robson/">Chelsea Bruce</a>, 16, who collapsed at a party and died after taking a hit.</p>

      <p>But despite serving time we can reveal his Snapchat account is being used to promote high-purity cocaine - known as Prop - at £80 a gram.</p>
      <p>Tonight, Scottish Conservative shadow justice secretary Liam Kerr said: “This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs.</p>
      <p>“When this drug dealer was convicted and sentenced, his criminal operation should have gone down with him.</p>
      <p>“Instead, it’s still up-and-running and causing untold damage to vulnerable young people.</p>

        <figcaption>Chelsea Bruce died in July after taking drugs supplied by Reid</figcaption>

      <p>“This must cause even more misery to the family of the victim who have suffered enough.”</p>
      <p>It’s understood the account named 'Gucci' is being run by a pal on the outside.</p>
      <p>A message posted last night read: “Prop their £80 a gram. More weights call number if need about Glasgow/Pollok/Paisley all night. Save number.”</p>
      <p>And a message on Twitter from Reid, of Paisley, advertises the Snapchat account and offers “1g for 40, 2 for 70, 3 for 100, 2g of prop £140.”</p>

      <p>He even mocked cops with a crude “F*** the CID” spelled out in white powder.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4972879/drug-dealer-lewis-reid-guilty-chealsea-bruce-codey-brown/">Reid - nicknamed Gucci - is behind bars</a> after admitting 22 offences between August 2018 and July.</p>
      <p>Chelsea, from Glasgow, died in July after taking MDMA supplied by Reid.</p>
