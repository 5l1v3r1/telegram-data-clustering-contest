      <p>Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman has quashed any hopes of a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a>+ adaptation of the hit movie… because he doesn’t want to do a TV show.</p>
      <p>While the likes of Tom Hiddleston, Elizabeth Olsen and Anthony Mackie might be willing to reprise their roles on the small screen as Disney+ plans the rollout of new Marvel TV shows, we’re not going to see Black Panther as one of them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/avengers-chadwick-boseman-cast-guardians-galaxys-drax-11186364/">Chadwick, who plays the lead role of T’Challa aka Black Panther</a>, is focussing on movies rather than working in TV.</p>
      <p>When asked which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a> co-star he would choose to team up with for another Marvel adventure, Chadwick told MTV: ‘I wouldn’t because I don’t want to do a TV show.</p>
      <p>‘I wouldn’t choose one so I can’t answer that. But I have a whole list of things that I’m excited about and none of those are franchises.’</p>

      <p>While we won’t get the TV show we were hoping for, Chadwick will be returning to the iconic role for<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/marvel-movies-disney-releasing-now-2023-11170363/"> Black Panther 2, slated for a 2022 release.</a></p>
      <p>He revealed what he hoped to see from the sequel: ‘Hopefully we can maintain the foundation that we set and build upon it and expand and explore.</p>

      <p>‘That’s what I hope, but I think first you need to maintain the foundation. We built a culture and a world and so you have to make sure that you keep that in place.’</p>
      <p>Ryan Coogler will be returning to direct the sequel and previously admitted there was some pressure to match the success of the first film, which grossed $1.34billion (£1.03billion) at the box office.</p>
      <p>He told IndieWire: ‘I think the pressure is kind of always going to be there. I’ve had a chance to make three feature films, each one of them had its own very specific type of pressure. In the process of it, it feels insurmountable each time.</p>
      <p>‘When it comes to making a sequel, I’ve never done it before, a sequel to something that I’ve directed myself.</p>

      <p>‘So I think there’s gonna be a lot of pressure there, but what we’re going to try to do is just focus on the work, like we always do.</p>
      <p>‘Really try to go step by step and try to quiet everything else around us, really focus on trying to make something that has some type of meaning.’</p>

      <p>While details of the storyline are a closely-guarded secret, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige previously revealed the studios have decided on a ‘pretty solid direction’ for the second film.</p>
