      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:34:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:34</time> by <a rel="author">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn</a> guard <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a> will miss a third straight game with a right shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>The Nets said Tuesday that the All-Star guard wouldn’t play Wednesday when they host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/charlotte-hornets">Charlotte</a>.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn beat <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/chicago-bulls">Chicago</a> on Saturday in its first game without Irving, but lost Monday to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/indiana-pacers">Indiana</a> in its return home after a five-game road trip.</p>
      <p>The Nets are also without their other starting guard, as Caris LeVert had surgery on his right thumb.</p>
