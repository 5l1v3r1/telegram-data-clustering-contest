      <p>The Old Vic artistic director Matthew Warchus said: “Amy Herzog is one of my favourite living writers – she writes with a deceptively powerful simplicity, full of extraordinary grace, precision and radiance.</p>
      <p>“I’m very much looking forward to working with this exceptional cast on her gorgeous play, which abounds with intimate beauty and truth.”</p>
      <p>Oscar-nominated Chalamet, 23, is one of Hollywood’s most sought-after young actors and recently appeared in Netflix period drama The King.</p>
      <p>Dame Eileen, 85, is a multi-award winning actress whose career spans seven decades.</p>

      <p>The billing for 4,000 Miles reads: “At the beginning of the summer 21-year-old Leo set out from the West Coast cycling across America with his best friend.</p>
      <p>“After weeks of radio silence, no-one is more surprised than his 91-year-old grandmother, Vera, when Leo turns up on her Manhattan doorstep in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>“His life just starting, hers nearly ended, in a faded Greenwich Village apartment their griefs collide.”</p>
      <p>4,000 Miles, which was a finalist for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for drama, is set to open on April 16 2020, with previews from April 6.</p>
      <p>It is part of Warchus’s season five, alongside productions of A Christmas Carol, Samuel Beckett plays Endgame and Rough For Theatre II, and Mark Knopfler’s musical Local Hero.</p>
