      <p>With the everyday changing trends in business particularly the banking sector where bank branches are visited less often, bank customers (particularly millennials) have consistently resorted to doing more of their banking online and on mobile, banks have continuously sought innovative ways on how they can keep their customers in the banking halls.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered Bank Uganda has partnered with Endiro coffee (one of the leading coffee brands in the country) to introduce Coffee Banking, a concept which enables clients to enjoy premium coffee whilst banking. This is the first of its kind innovation in the financial services sector in Uganda.</p>
      <p>The Endiro brand has positioned itself as one of the premier coffee brands in Uganda, leading the way in serving high quality, single village-lotted and ethically sourced Ugandan coffees onto the local and international markets.</p>
      <p>The coffee shop has been set up right within the Bank’s lavish, state-of-the-art and spacious Speke Road Banking Hall located at its Headquarters and will further be set-up at all Standard Chartered Bank branches countrywide.</p>
      <p>During the unveiling of the concept ‘Coffee Banking,’ Dr Robin Kibuka, the Board Chairman, Standard Chartered said the coffee outlet has been set up to offer additional convenience as well as improving customer experience to their clients who come in banking halls.</p>
      <p>“I am delighted that we have added a feature to our brick and mortar facility that will further improve our clients’ experience. The Endiro coffee outlet within our Speke Road Banking Hall has been set up to offer additional convenience to our clients.</p>
      <p>“We have over the years redefined and demystified banking by first and foremost making it more experiential and customer-centric with warm banking halls, first-class ambiences and user-friendly facilities that are designed to improve clients’ experiences,”  Kibuka said.</p>
      <p>“The Bank that prides itself on being a trailblazer and being the first to introduce innovations through products and services that revolutionize banking services in Uganda, has once again set a new trend and milestone by partnering with Endiro Coffee. We are committed to ensuring that a visit to any branch is an unrivalled experience akin to the hospitality business,” he noted.</p>
      <p>He also added that for the last 107 years that Standard Chartered bank has existed in Uganda, they’ve tried to evolve and innovate on customer centred services that have kept them on the market.</p>
      <p>“The bank has existed for the last 107 years and we always try to bring forth innovations that suit our client needs. We saw it necessary to partner with Endiro coffee to give our customers a much better service experience mostly to those who come to the bank.</p>
      <p>The Managing Director of Endiro Coffee, Gloria Katusiime in her speech mentioned the capabilities and offers of the coffee bar that has been placed within the Bank.</p>
      <p>“We are very grateful to Standard Chartered Bank for this great opportunity and partnership. I want to assure you that Endiro Coffee is the right partner and has so much in common with Standard Chartered Bank. We share similar values such as exceptional client service, responsiveness, innovation and a wide range of products that meet various clients’ tastes and preferences,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We are proud to be associated with the Bank and our commitment is to provide the highest quality products and customer service that meet or exceed the Bank’s client needs.</p>
      <p>“At this outlet, we shall be offering coffees and snacks at affordable prices during the normal Bank opening hours. We welcome all customers to try out our products and give us feedback to ensure we consistently meet their expectations,” Katusiime added.</p>
      <p>She added that “This is coffee that is sourced directly from Bududa district in the village of Bukassi, this partnership is much more than the bank itself, it is changing lives for the people in those areas and we want to support our people as we consume locally sourced products.”</p>
      <p>“This is Ugandan coffee, for so long we’ve been exporting coffee. What we want is to see Ugandans consume their very own high-quality products as well and this partnership will cater for those customers.”</p>
      <p>The Coffee Banking innovation that Standard Chartered Bank has unveiled in partnership with Endiro is a new way of banking that provides a holistic and transformative experience as the Bank continues to differentiate itself and offer luxuries and convenience to all its customers across all segments.</p>
