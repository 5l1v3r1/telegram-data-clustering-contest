        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> 2016 winner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/scarlett-moffatt-axed-dream-ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-job-11178959/">Scarlett Moffatt has been axed</a> as a co-host of Ant &amp; Dec’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saturday-night-takeaway/">Saturday Night Takeaway</a> after three years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarlett had previously referred to the role as ‘an absolute dream’.</p>
      <p>This move has led to fresh interest in old rumours concerning Scarlett Moffatt and her now-ex-co-host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a>…</p>
      <h3>Were Scarlett Moffatt and Ant McPartlin ever an item?</h3>
      <p>Despite speculation among fans online, both Scarlett and Ant – who met on I’m A Celebrity – have firmly denied that there was ever anything romantic between them.</p>
      <p>Rumours took flight in 2018 after Scarlett posted a selfie with a framed picture in the background of her, Ant and Dec filming an episode of Saturday Night Takeaway in which she was dressed as Mary Poppins.</p>
      <p>She has previously been quoted in the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/921147/Scarlett-Moffatt-Ant-McPartlin-relationship-Instagram-boyfriend-Lee-Wilkinson-Dec-news-ITV">Express</a> as saying it was ‘A proper pinch me moment!’</p>

      <p>Last year, Scarlett told Digital Spy on the subject of the relationship rumours: ‘Well it wasn’t true so, honestly, I always think, “Those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind”.</p>

      <p>‘My family and friends knew, so no, it didn’t really enter my head. I do love a conspiracy theory myself, but I’m more of an alien, mermaid sort of conspiracy girl.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a picture of me as Mary Poppins. It even beats me in the jungle, like the highlight of my working life. To do the Saturday Night Takeaway finale in Disney World, honestly, was my dream. So every morning when I wake up and see that photo, I’m like, “I’m living my dream”.’</p>

      <p>On the topic of her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/scarlett-moffatt-no-hard-feelings-saturday-night-takeaway-axing-11183165/">leaving Saturday Night Takeaway</a>, Scarlett told <a href="http://Metro.co.uk/">Metro.co.uk</a> that she has ‘no hard feelings’ about the decision.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I was actually a bit confused as to why it was big news because it hasn’t actually been on for two years.</p>
      <p>‘And then when I spoke to everybody there, my role on that show was sort of like the challenge anarchist style where I was running to houses and in helicopters going up and meeting people and they’ve taken that out now.</p>
      <p>‘It’s going to just be Ant, Dec and Stephen so I feel like that’s a good trio. It’s going to be fun, I’ll still be tuning in.’</p>

      <p>‘I keep getting asked is Scott [is] the one, but I daren’t respond in fear that I jinx it.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘Thank you for making me laugh, for making me a better person and for working hard always as a police officer.</p>
