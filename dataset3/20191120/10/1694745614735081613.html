      <p>We all know <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kelly-Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> knows how to get down and funky with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/the-kelly-clarkson-show-music-cover-videos-46607055">her "Kellyoke" music covers on <b>The Kelly Clarkson Show</b></a>, but she's giving us goosebumps with her latest performance. The daytime host covered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0">Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars's megahit, "Uptown Funk,"</a> and she did the boogie anthem justice with her spirited rendition. From the sound of those powerful runs liberally sprinkled throughout the song, we can tell Clarkson definitely felt the groovy spirit for this one. Watch the performance above, then check out another "Kellyoke" cover that was <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-covers-rihanna-only-girl-in-the-world-video-46904733">adorably upstaged by Clarkson's kids</a>!</p>
