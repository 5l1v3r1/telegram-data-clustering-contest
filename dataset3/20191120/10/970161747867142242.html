      <p>Dominic Raab today defended changing the official Tory Twitter account to appear as a fact-checking account by saying it was ‘a really good instant rebuttal mechanism’.</p>
      <p>The foreign secretary told the BBC: ‘No-one gives a toss about the social media cut and thrust.’</p>
      <p>When questioned on the response of legitimate fact-checking charity Full Fact, who tweeted that it was ‘inappropriate and misleading’ for the Conservative press office to rename their account, Mr Raab said: ‘It doesn’t sound to me like they like competition.’</p>

      <p>The @CCHQpress account is verified by Twitter, displaying a blue tick which is intended to denote that a user is genuine.</p>
      <p>During the leaders debate live on ITV last night, CCHQ changed it’s name to ‘factcheckUK’ as well as its profile and header pictures.</p>
      <p>It then retweeted tweets supporting the prime minister, questioned statements made by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and sent a tweet saying Boris Johnson was the ‘clear winner’.</p>

      <p>The move was widely condemned for being misleading to the public, including by Twitter, who issued a statement warning: ‘Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information will result in decisive corrective action.’</p>
      <p>But Mr Raab said the Conservatives ‘will make no apology for having an instant rebuttal of the nonsense and lies’ spread by opposition parties.</p>
      <p>Earlier he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘We’ll always abide by the rules with these things and if there’s advice that comes out, look at it very carefully.’</p>
      <p>Asked whether the Conservatives would do it again, he said: ‘The handle of the Twitter account was very clearly linked to the Conservative Party, but we make no apologies for having an instant rebuttal for all the nonsense and lies put out, and Jeremy Corbyn repeating it last night, saying we want to sell off the NHS.’</p>

      <p>Mr Raab continued: ‘Look, we’ll look at the advice from Twitter, but we will make no apology for having an instant rebuttal of the nonsense and lies.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Well, I’m not in charge of social media, but actually I think the account was very clearly linked to the CCHQ, it was on the face of it, but we’re rebutting the nonsense that systematically gets put out about the Conservative position so that voters and so that your listeners know the truth.’</p>
