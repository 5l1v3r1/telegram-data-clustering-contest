        <b>"'It' was on this planet for a very, very, very long time and that’s a lot of bloodshed and a lot of stories to tell."</b>
      </p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/it-chapter-2"><i>It: Chapter Two</i></a> screenwriter has teased the idea of a Pennywise spin-off movie.</p>
      <p>Gary Dauberman, who worked on both <a href="http://nme.com/tag/it"><i>It</i></a> films, also discussed the release of a deleted scenes “supercut” from the second film.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The second adaptation of Stephen King’s novel came out earlier this year, and Dauberman has been discussing the potential to expand the <i>It</i> franchise into more films.</p>
      <p>“I do think it’s possible,” he told <a href="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/horror/it-chapter-two-writer-gary-dauberman-talks-spinoff-possibilities-and-that-rumored-supercut-exclusive-a171703"><i>ComicBookMovie</i></a>. “Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me but there’s only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies.</p>
      <p>“There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie. It’s just a question of whether or not people want to see it but I do think It was on this planet for a very, very, very long time and that’s a lot of bloodshed and a lot of stories to tell and I think you could do that for sure.”</p>

      <p>Pennywise from ‘It: Chapter 2’</p>
      <p>Going on to discuss a potential supercut of <i>It: Chapter 2</i> deleted scenes, saying: “I know Andy [Muschietti, director] has an idea about a ‘supercut’ which I would love to see but we cut things for a reason so if there was something I desperately wanted to see or wanted put in there, we could have found a way to put it in.</p>
      <p>“That’s not to say that the stuff that’s not in there isn’t great but we put the stuff that’s in the movie there because that’s what makes it better.”</p>
      <p>“I can’t think of anything offhand where I’d say I wish we hadn’t cut that and I can’t wait for people to see but I think there’s plenty of things there that fans would love to check out if there was to be a ‘supercut.'”</p>
      <p>Dauberman’s comments follow <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/it-chapter-two-star-bill-skarsgard-reveals-ideas-for-a-third-film-2548871">actor Bill Skarsgård revealing that a third movie could be in the works</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/it-chapter-2-review-stephen-king-pennywise"><i>NME</i>‘s review of <i>It: Chapter Two</i></a> called the sequel a “funny, fright-filled ode to horror heritage,” with Alex Flood writing: “For the most part, Muschietti’s sequel is a tightly-constructed potboiler that balances humour and horror in a satisfying way. As a bonus, Derry’s bloodthirsty harlequin has a hinted-at backstory that’s perfect for a prequel. Who knows? Pennywise may have the last laugh after all.”</p>
