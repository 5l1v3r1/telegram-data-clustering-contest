      <p>A Livingston primary school welcomed a special guest last week as former pupil and professional basketball player Callum Mortimer dropped by to donate equipment and take the school’s team for a training session.</p>
      <p>Callum (16) plays for the Glasgow Rocks in the British Basketball League and teamed up with Basketball Scotland to pay St Ninian’s a visit and donate basketballs to the school.</p>
      <p>And he took time out to shoot some hoops and chat to the youngsters about his career in the sport, which has included representing Scotland at various youth levels.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>St Ninian’s PE teacher Fraser McCurdy said Callum’s visit has shown his pupils that achieving their dreams is possible.</p>
      <p>He commented: “It was brilliant of Callum to take the time alongside a very busy school and training schedule to visit his old primary school. The pupils have been inspired by his visit.</p>
      <p>“There is a buzz around the basketball club and the pupils have been talking about meeting and playing with a professional basketball player non-stop.</p>
      <p>“It has been great for pupils to see that a former pupil of their school has worked hard enough to make it pro, it motivates them to make their dreams a reality.”</p>
