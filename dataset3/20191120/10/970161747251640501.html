      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of mis-pronouncing Jeffrey Epstein’s name to make him ‘sound more Jewish’ amid accusations of anti-Semitism against him and the Labour party.</p>
      <p>During the ITV leaders debate last night both he and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> were asked whether <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> is ‘fit for purpose’ after his ‘car crash’ interview over his relationship with the billionaire sex offender.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader – who has come under fire for his handling of the anti-Semitism allegations against him – said Epstein’s name with the sounding ‘Epshtine’ rather than ‘Epsteen’, with many viewers picking up on it online.</p>
      <p>Comedian David Baddiel said ‘every Jew noticed’ while quoting a tweet that said the Labour leader’s pronunciation made the paedophile ‘sound more Jewish’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I think it was a subconscious thing and meaning is up for discussion.</p>
      <p>‘But as one who DM’d last night said; it’s a thing that feels visceral to Jews but oblique to the outside world.’</p>

      <p>He later added that he did not think Mr Corbyn deliberately made the ‘Epshtein’ pronunciation, adding: ‘I think that moment was subconscious: which perhaps says more.’</p>

      <p>During the debate Mr Corbyn said: ‘Before we discuss Prince Andrew I think we should discuss the victims that were there because of what Epstein was doing.</p>
      <p>‘I think there are very, very serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law.</p>
      <p>‘But the primary position ought to be the proper treatment of those people who were the victims of the most appalling behaviour by apparently Epstein and many others.’</p>
      <p>Mr Baddiel wasn’t alone in condemning the pronunciation, with many taking to Twitter to call it out as anti-Semitic.</p>

      <p>During the debate, the prime minister accused Mr Corbyn of ‘a complete failure of leadership’ in his handling of anti-Semitism within Labour.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said anti-Semitism was ‘an absolute evil and scourge within our society’ and insisted the party treated the issue ‘very, very seriously’.</p>
      <p>ITV host Julie Etchingham received a round of applause when she asked Mr Corbyn about a poll showing many Jewish people do not trust him over anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Labour leader replied: ‘I have taken action in my party, where anyone who has committed any anti-Semitic acts or made any anti-Semitic statements, they are either suspended or expelled from the party and we’ve investigated every single case.</p>
      <p>‘We do take this very seriously indeed.’</p>
      <p>But Karen Pollock, CEO of the Holocaust Educational Trust, tweeted that Mr Corbyn’s claims were ‘blatantly untrue’.</p>
