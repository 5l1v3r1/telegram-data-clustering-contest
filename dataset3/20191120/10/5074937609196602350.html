      <p>Breman Asikuma (C/R), Nov. 19, GNA - Mobile Telecommunication giant, MTN Ghana has expressed its determination to support the promotion of Ghana's cultural heritage.</p>
      <p>This is the most sustainable way to preserve the rich Ghanaian culture and traditional institutions, promote national integration, cohesion and development.</p>
      <p>"We are determined to sustain the rich Ghanaian culture and prevent it adulteration and extinction to essentially promote national integration and cohesion to create employment opportunities for the people and promote local tourism.</p>
      <p>"This forms an integral segment of the organization's unwavering commitment to support economic empowerment initiatives as part of efforts to give back to society through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).”</p>
      <p>Mr Kennedy Ofosuhene, Corporate Services Adviser for Southern Ghana, said this at a presentation made towards celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Odeefo Amuakwa Buadu VIII, Omanhene of the Breman Traditional Area in Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa (AOB) District of the Central Region.</p>
      <p>The anniversary coincided with the 2019 Breman Odwira festival of the chiefs and people in the area which was held under the theme: “Promoting citizens’ responsibility for Bremanman’s development”.</p>
      <p>On behalf of MTN, Mr Ofosuhene donated cash of GH¢3,000.00 and airtime worth GH¢ 3,000.00, souvenir and a hamper.</p>
      <p>He called on the public to maximise Ghana's unique cultural heritage and enhance it.</p>
      <p>Odeefuo Amuakwa Buadu VIII, hailed MTN for the gesture and its resoluteness in taking a bold lead in providing telecommunication services to its growing customers across the country.</p>
      <p>The Omanhene of the Breman Traditional Area who is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Baxoil Company Limited, a Ghanaian oil company that produces quality Baxoil-branded lubricant, ascended the throne on May 31, 2009 at age 41 after succeeding his late uncle, Odeefuo Amuakwa Buadu VII.</p>
      <p>The celebration would be climaxed with a grand durbar at the Catholic Boys Basic School park at Breman Asikuma on Saturday, November 17, 2019.</p>
      <p>The Omanhene expressed his commitment to the development of the social and economic well-being of the area, hence, the formulation and adoption of a five-year medium-term strategic development plan and the formation of the Breman Development Committee with Kyidomhene, Nana Barima Fi III, as the chairman to spearhead its implementation.</p>
      <p>The six goals contained in the new plan are youth development, agriculture, education, health, tourism and resource development.</p>
      <p>The Omanhene called for the support of citizens of the area, both home and abroad, towards the growth and development of the area.</p>
      <p>Odeefuo Buadu commended the chiefs and the people, including all stakeholders for their immeasurable support during the last 10 years of his reign which has witnessed peace, unity and progress.</p>
      <p>He also thanked the people for living in harmony since his ascension to the throne, saying “it is only when we live in peace and harmony as a people that our traditional area can achieve the desired growth”.</p>
