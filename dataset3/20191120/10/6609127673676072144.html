      <p>It is understood former Scotland star Roger Baird and Dr Bobby Low made “unacceptable” remarks that left guests “disgusted”, according to a social media eyewitness.</p>
      <p>She said: “The comments made both during speeches and to individual members of the club were utterly unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“The majority of the room were openly disgusted and it provides some comfort that those condoning the behaviour are very much a minority.</p>
      <p>“This is everyone's problem. Such a sentiment is rife in the rugby world. Such a sentiment should be tolerated no longer. This is their shame and I hope they are embarrassed.”</p>
      <p>It was also alleged that a rugby team member was “touched inappropriately”.</p>
      <p>The university’s two rugby clubs have confirmed they plan to hold crisis talks in a bid to deal with the grim scenes witnessed at the anniversary dinner.</p>
      <p>In a joint statement, they said: “We would like to unreservedly apologise to those who attended the 150th Anniversary Rugby Club Dinner on Saturday 16 November and who may have been offended by some of the speeches.</p>
      <p>“As Rugby clubs we were shocked and appalled at elements of the content, which in no way reflects or values or beliefs.</p>
      <p>“We have reached out to offer a personal apology to some of the top table guests and have made arrangements for an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held as soon as possible to discuss Saturday’s event and the behaviour of certain individuals.</p>
      <p>“To repeat, the views that were expressed – regardless of whether it was an attempt at humour – have no place in our clubs, our sports department or our University.</p>
      <p>“Saturday should have been about celebrating a great anniversary, and marking the tremendous progress that has been made in both the men’s and women’s game.</p>
      <p>“We are extremely disappointed and will not allow outdated views and attitudes within our clubs which are open and welcoming to all students of the University of Glasgow.”</p>
      <p>Both clubs were backed by the university itself, who tweeted: “We wholeheartedly support the @GUSAWomensRugby and @GUSAMensRugby statement regarding the 150th rugby club anniversary dinner on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>“We were extremely disappointed and saddened to hear about some elements of the event.</p>
      <p>“These in no way reflect the values or beliefs of the sports clubs, @UofGsport or the University.</p>
      <p>“We are proud to be an inclusive and welcoming organisation.”</p>
