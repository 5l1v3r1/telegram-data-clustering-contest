      <h1>Netflix to release chilling documentary about 'America's most prolific serial killer'</h1>
      <h2>Netflix documentary series The Confession Killer focuses on a serial killer named Henry Lee Lucas who chillingly boasted of murdering 600 people</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:12:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Netflix have released a trailer for a chilling new documentary series.</p>
      <p>The Confession Killer tells the story of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas who was successfully convicted of murdering three people before then delivering further confessions - hundreds of them and in great detail.</p>
      <p>However, the uncomfortable twist to this was that he may not have even done them, despite the level of detail in the description given even including sketches of his victims.</p>
      <p>Lucas was eventually sentenced to death, but subsequent investigations soon began to show that he could not have been responsible for all of the killings he claimed were his own.</p>
      <p>There were a great number of inaccuracies that showed he wasn't exactly being honest, but how did he know everything about the murders?</p>

      <p>DNA test would go on to prove further contradictions to what Henry Lee Lucas was telling authorities.</p>
      <p>So, why did the criminal justice system allow him to be convicted without true justice being done for the murders he was not guilty of?</p>
      <p>Finally, how was Lucas able to fool so many people with his killer confessions?</p>
      <p>Naturally, true crime fans on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> will be incredibly excited at the prospect of the documentary.</p>

      <p>The official synopsis on Netflix reads: "During the early '80s, Henry Lee Lucas confessed to hundreds of murders, bringing closure to unsolved cases and grieving families.</p>
      <p>"Even with no direct evidence linking Lucas to the crime scenes, he stunned authorities with his ability to sketch victims' portraits while citing brutal details of each attack.</p>
      <p>"Yet journalists and attorneys found impossibilities in Lucas’ timeline, and DNA testing started to contradict his internationally-reported claims.</p>
      <p>"THE CONFESSION KILLER, a riveting five-part docuseries, explores how the man once called America’s most prolific serial killer was really a complex figure entangled in a flawed justice system. Directed by Oscar nominee Robert Kenner (<i>Food, Inc.</i>) and Taki Oldham."</p>
