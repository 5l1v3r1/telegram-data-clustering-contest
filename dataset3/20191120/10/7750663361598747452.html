      <p>Spurs announced on Tuesday evening that Pochettino <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/sack-race/news/spurs-part-ways-with-mauricio-pochettino_379916.html">had been sacked</a> after overseeing a disappointing start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the London club are currently 14th in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League table</a> with just three wins from their 12 matches, which led to the Argentine losing his role as manager.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have already moved for a replacement - <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/tottenham-confirm-jose-mourinho-as-new-manager_379969.html">becoming the new head coach</a> on a contract until the end of the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Telegraph</i>, Spurs were keen for Pochettino to resign last week but the 47-year-old refused, forcing chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> to make the decision ahead of Saturday's clash with West Ham United.</p>
      <p>The former Espanyol manager leaves the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with a record of 159 wins, 62 draws and 72 defeats from his 293 matches at the helm.</p>
