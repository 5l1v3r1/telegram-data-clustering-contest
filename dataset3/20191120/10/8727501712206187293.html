      <h1>Almodóvar, Sciamma and other world-class filmmakers are coming to town to spill their screenwriting secrets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:59:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author">By Time Out Film</a></address>
      <p>Awards season, eh? The red carpets, the media prognosticators, the world-stopping wardrobe choices of Tilda Swinton. It’s the time of year when movieland’s great and good take a front seat in our thoughts and we all learn to spell words like prognosticator. Sometimes, though, it’s nice to step behind the glamour and into the world of the filmmakers. Roll up, then, for one of next month’s hottest tickets: Bafta’s tenth annual Screenwriters’ Lecture Series.</p>
      <p>These won’t be lectures in the dry, academic sense. Far from it. Instead, five brilliant screenwriter-filmmakers – Céline Sciamma, Bong Joon Ho, Robert Eggers, Noah Baumbach and Pedro Almodóvar – will be giving talks on their awards-tipped films, ‘<a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/film/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a>’, ‘<a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/film/parasite-2019">Parasite</a>’, ‘<a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/film/The-Lighthouse-1">The Lighthouse</a>’, ‘<a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/film/marriage-story-2019">Marriage Story</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/film/Pain-and-Glory">Pain and Glory</a>’ respectively.</p>
      <p>‘The Bafta Screenwriters’ Lecture Series is a rare opportunity to hear insights into the craft of screenwriting from some of the most unique voices in the world,’ says Mariayah Kaderbhai, Bafta’s head of programmes. ‘This year’s exciting line-up features renowned screenwriters from across the globe, highlighting that the best stories are always those that are most universal.’</p>
      <p>Bad news, though: Almodóvar's has sold out. Good news: there are still tickets up for grabs for the others.</p>
      <p>Céline Sciamma<br/>Curzon Mayfair. Dec 2. 6.15pm.</p>
      <p>Noah Baumbach<br/>Curzon Mayfair. Dec 5. 5.30pm.</p>
      <p>Robert Eggers<br/>Curzon Mayfair. Dec 7. 6pm.</p>
      <p>Bong Joon Ho<br/>Curzon Mayfair. Dec 12. 6.15pm.</p>
      <p>Tickets are £20, which feels like a steal to hear these virtuoso filmmakers in person. To book, or for more info on the series, head to the <a href="http://www.curzoncinemas.com/bafta">Curzon website</a>. </p>
