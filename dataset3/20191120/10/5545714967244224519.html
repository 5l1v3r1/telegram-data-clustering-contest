      <p>Poor Handsome Jack. First they took his life. Then they took his legacy. For their final trick, they're going to rob him of his riches. This is why you always get buried with all your valuables.</p>
      <p>Gearbox has pulled back the curtain on <i>Borderlands 3</i>'s first proper piece of DLC, and it kicks Handsome Jack while he's down (and dead). <i>Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot</i> is an <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>-like caper where Moxxi enlists the Vault Hunters to infiltrate Handsome Jack's derelict space station casino with the intention of robbing it blind. Called "the gaudiest gambling spot in the galaxy," it's no wonder Moxxi's attracted to it.</p>

      <p>Set in a neon-drenched and gold-soaked viceland that would make Vegas blush, this add-on has new campaign and side missions, never-before-seen enemies, "larger than life bosses," new legendaries, and new cosmetics. Gearbox says the DLC is tuned for a minimum level of 13, and obviously scales (in terms of both challenge and loot) for all the players who are much further than that.</p>
      <p><i>Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot </i>releases on all platforms on December 19. No price was given, but the <i>Borderlands 3</i> season pass is $50 and includes four add-ons. It'd be reasonable to assume they all cost $15 a la carte. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, take a look at the trailer that's embedded above and the screenshots in the gallery below. Study them. Preparation is paramount for any good heist, even when you're stealing from a dead guy.</p>
