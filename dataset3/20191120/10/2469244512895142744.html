      <p>If Helen of Troy was the face that launched a thousand ships, then the <a href="https://www.southwestnissan.co.uk/new-cars/qashqai/">Nissan Qashqai</a> could perhaps be billed as the car which launched a thousand crossovers - though maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration. Still, the Qashqai could certainly be hailed as the car which got the crossover ball rolling.</p>
      <p>The model served as the blueprint for all the scaled-down SUVs that have burst on to the scene since its arrival more than 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>Essentially, people can’t get enough of crossovers, which are now available in all manner of shapes and sizes, and every mainstream car maker is churning them out for all they’re worth.</p>
      <p>Before the Qashqai, a crossover was something slightly different - an estate car that served as a halfway house between a conventional estate and an SUV. They had ever so slightly elevated ride height, more rugged looks and more often than not four-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>But latterly, the term has come to encompass the plethora of modern day vehicles that are characterised by SUV styling, without necessarily being an SUV.</p>
      <p>It was Nissan who paved the way into this brave new world, announcing plans for a range of SUV-inspired vehicles big and small, before the Qashqai went on to become the genre-defining model for this new classification of vehicle.</p>
      <h3>Paving the way</h3>
      <p>The Qashqai has evolved considerably since its beginning but, like all success stories, it has stuck pretty closely to its original brief as a family car that looks like an SUV. Its distinguishing features are: added ride height and the chunky styling clues that define an SUV. With that, comes inherent practicality.</p>
      <p>Put all these together and it’s easy to see why crossovers, or compact and mid-sized SUVs - as they are also commonly known - have proved so popular.</p>

      <p>The second generation version of the Qashqai underwent a hefty mid-life make-over in 2017 and changes have followed since then - the latest being the addition of a new petrol engine. The 1.3 DIG-T engine replaces 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol units and offers more power, better economy and lower emissions than both.</p>
      <p>It is available in two power guises - delivering either 140ps or 160ps. As one might expect, the lower powered variant offers better economy at the expense of performance, as the 160ps engine takes the Qashqai from 0-62mph in 8.9 seconds and offers economy on the combined cycle of 49.6mpg.</p>
      <p>The 140ps variant, however, completes the 0-62mph sprint in a little over 10 seconds and has an overall economy figure of 53.2mpg. Emission figures are 130g/km for the 160ps and 121g/km for the 140ps.</p>
      <p>The Renault-Nissan alliance have done a great job with the new engine, which is super-smooth and refined.</p>
      <p>With different trims available, the Tekna model sits near the top of the range - topped only by the Tekna+ - and makes for a decent drive in a vehicle which is definitely more car-like than SUV-like. There’s minimal pitch and role, and the ride quality is noticeably comfortable.</p>
      <h3>Comfortable interior</h3>
      <p>On the inside, the Qashqai has definitely become plusher and more premium in character over the years, in line with automotive trends, but Nissan has made notably big strides.</p>
      <p>There’s plenty of up to the minute tech, including a seven inch touchscreen navigation and entertainment system which is excellent and wonderfully easy to use.</p>

      <p>The spacious cabin is another big Qashqai bonus, as is the 403-litre boot, which expands to 1,958 with the rear seats folded.</p>
      <p>The Qashqai might now have a coterie of competitors but it still manages to hold its own admirably, and is a good example of a great idea that can last.</p>
