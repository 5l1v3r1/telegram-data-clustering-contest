      <h2>Yorgen Fenech was seized on a yacht in the probe into the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia.</h2>

      <p>Maltese authorities have arrested a prominent businessman who appears to be a “person of interest” in the assassination of a leading investigative reporter.</p>
      <p>Yorgen Fenech was on a yacht that was intercepted sailing northwards away from Malta by the military early on Wednesday and forced back to port.</p>
      <p>In remarks to reporters, prime minister Joseph Muscat did not directly tie the arrest to the murder of 53-year-old Daphne Caruana Galizia in a car bombing in October 2017, but he said it appeared to result from comments he made a day earlier the possibility of a pardon for an alleged middleman who had offered to identify the mastermind of the killing.</p>
      <p>Ms Caruana Galizia’s three sons were more direct in their comments on Twitter, making a direct link between the arrest and their mother’s assassination.</p>

      <p>“If I had not given these instructions, maybe today we might be speaking of persons of interest who might have escaped,” Mr Muscat told reporters.</p>
      <p>He declined to comment further out of concern that any comments might prejudice a case.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said no politician is tied to Ms Caruana Galizia’s murder, by tweets from her sons tie the arrested businessman directly to Muscat’s chief of staff and a former energy minister.</p>
      <p>No details of charges against Fenech have been revealed, but authorities would have 48 hours to decide on them.</p>
      <p>He is a prominent hotelier and director of the Maltese power company. His name was on leaked documents as a source of income for companies named in the Panama Papers.</p>
      <p>Ms Caruana Galizia alleged on her blog eight months before her death that a company called 17 Black Ltd was connected to Maltese politicians, but provided no specific evidence.</p>
      <p>That reporting was picked up by the Daphne Project after her murder. It reported in April 2018 that Malta’s anti-money laundering watchdog had identified Fenech, the chief executive of a Maltese property developer, as the owner of 17 Black.</p>
      <p>The Daphne Project followed a paper trail to two Panama companies in the names of two people close to Mr Muscat — his chief of staff and the former energy minister — that stood to receive payments from 17 Black for unspecified services. There is no evidence the payments went ahead.</p>
