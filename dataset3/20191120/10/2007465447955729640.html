      <h2>BMW upcoming electric i4 sedan will have 530 horsepower</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:19:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/jose-altoveros.html" target="_blank">Jose Altoveros</a></address>
      <p>Come 2021, BMW will be officially launching the much anticipated i4 electric sedan. In order to whet our appetite ahead of its official debut, the Bavarian automaker has released some juicy information together with new photos of the fully-electric sedan. Shockingly, pun intended, it will be more powerful than the M4 performance coupe.</p>
      <p>According to BMW, the i4 will be powered by a 530 horsepower electric motor and have an 80 kWh battery pack. This allows the BMW’s upcoming electric sedan to go from 0 to 100 km/h in 4 seconds flat. At the same time, the automaker claims that the battery pack allows it to have a range of 600 kilometers based on WLPT standards. Furthermore, BMW claims the i4 can be charged to 80% in just 35 minutes thanks to a 150kW charging capability.</p>

      <p>These specs alone make the i4 a serious contender against other EVs on the market today, specifically the similarly sized Tesla Model 3. For reference, BMW says the i4 will be similarly sized and shaped to the BMW 4-Series Gran Coupe we know today. Despite the heavy camouflage, it doesn’t appear to look radically different from current gasoline/diesel-powered BMW models. This is in contrast to the i3 and i8, both of which have very futuristic styling cues.</p>
      <p>Before the debut of the i4, BMW will first reveal the iX3 crossover, another all-electric model set to be revealed in 2020. Despite the name, BMW says the all-electric crossover will still look similar to its internal combustion engine counterpart in terms of design. The Bavarian automaker plans to have 25 models with electric drives by 2025.  </p>
