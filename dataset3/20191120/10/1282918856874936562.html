      <p>Hong Kong fans turned their backs to the Chinese national anthem once again but supported their team and were rewarded with a first win in Asian qualifying, 2-0, over Cambodia, on Tuesday. Before the match, home fans jeered and turned their backs to the pitch as the Chinese national anthem played.  FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association 15,000 Swiss francs (13,700 euros or HKD 117,944) following a similar incident before the September 10 match against Iran.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, James Ha put the hosts ahead with a close-range half-volley in the 21st minute. Cambodia, under pressure for most of the match, were reduced to 10 men in the 78th minute when Soeuy Visal was sent off after flicking the ball out of the goalkeeper's hands to collect a second yellow card. Despite the disparity in numbers, the hard-working Roberto Affonso Junior was still surrounded by four Cambodian defenders when he spun on the edge of the box five minutes later and curled the ball into the net.</p>
