      <h1>Conor McGregor UFC news: Notorious' manager confirms 'talks progressing' over Donald Cerrone fight</h1>
      <h2>The Notorious has claimed he will make his long-awaited return to the octagon on January 18</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:00:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor's manager says talks are progressing over a potential fight with Donald Cerrone. </p>
      <p>The Notorious has claimed he will make his long-awaited return to the octagon on January 18, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/conor-mcgregors-manager-confirms-talks-20911802">reports The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>No announcement has been made on the Irishman's opponent but it is likely Cerrone will be the one he faces off against.</p>
      <p>And his manager Audie Attar has confirmed negotiations are underway between the two parties and believes an announcement is not far away.</p>
      <p>“I would say that talks have been progressing. We’ve met them, we’re in close communication with them," he said.</p>

      <p>"I would hope that an announcement could happen in the coming weeks, but at the end of the day, it’s still a work in progress.”</p>
      <p>The January bout will be <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor's</a> first since he was beaten by Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Attar insists he always knew the UFC superstar would make a return, despite McGregor previously suggesting he had retired.</p>

      <p>He believes McGregor will become a world champion again and doesn't see him slowing down, despite turning 32 next year.</p>
      <p>Attar adds: "He strives for greatness and dreams for things that nobody thought that he could accomplish, and he’s doing that again.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, that’s the thing people forgot about him; he actually is a competitor. He dares to do things differently.</p>
      <p>"That’s what’s exciting. It’s exciting to be a part of that and witness that and see that fire in him again. I love it.”</p>
