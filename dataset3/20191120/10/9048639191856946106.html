      <p>LITTLEVILLE, Ala. (AP) — An Alabama sheriff says two football fans “got into it” while watching the Louisiana State University-Alabama game and one is accused of fatally shooting the other during a fight, <a href="https://www.waff.com/2019/11/12/man-charged-with-attempted-murder-colbert-county/">WAFF reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson told the Florence TimesDaily that a group gathered to watch the Nov. 9 game at David Allen Fulkerson's home in Littleville. James Michael Roland Merritt was cheering for LSU, who beat Alabama that day 46-41.</p>
      <p>Court documents say the fight escalated when Fulkerson thought Merritt called him an expletive. Williamson says Fulkerson shot Merritt and added that alcohol was a "big" factor. Fulkerson contends he acted in self-defense during the fight.</p>
      <p>News outlets report Merritt died Friday after nearly a week on life support. Fulkerson is charged with murder.</p>
