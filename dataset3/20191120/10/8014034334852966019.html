      <p>BERLIN — A Jewish group has sharply condemned an auction of Nazi memorabilia in Germany that includes Adolf Hitler’s top hat, a silver-plated edition of his book “Mein Kampf” and a cocktail dress owned by his long-time girlfriend Eva Braun.</p>
      <p>The European Jewish Association condemned the auction Wednesday at Hermann Historica in Munich, saying that “it’s wrong to make money off these blood-soaked items, especially in Germany of all places.”</p>
      <p>The German news agency dpa reported that the auction house’s owner, Bernhard Pacher, rejected criticism, saying: “The majority of our customers are museums, public collections and private collectors who really deal with the topic meticulously.”</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Hermann Historica has been criticized for dealing with Nazi memorabilia. In 2016, it auctioned off one of Hitler’s uniforms for 275,000 euros ($304,270).</p>
