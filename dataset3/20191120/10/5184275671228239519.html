      <p><i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i> starring Ajay Devgn, Saif Ali Khan, Kajol and Sharad Kelkar has been in the news for all the right reasons. After treating the fans with intriguing posters, the makers released the powerful trailer yesterday. The trailer was perceived well by the audience but the film has hit a roadblock. Sambhaji Brigade has expressed their objection to many things shown in the trailer.</p>
      <p>The right-wing organisation, Sambhaji Brigade has raised demurral to some scenes from the trailer. Sambhaji Brigade found Tanhaji, a film based on the life of the legendary Tanhaji Malusare, the military leader in the army Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj depicting the history in a wrong way. In a letter sent to Tanhaji director Om Raut, the Sambhaji Brigade has raised objection about three things in the film.</p>

      <p>Firstly, they objected on the scene where a person is shown throwing a wooden stick at Shivaji Maharaj in the trailer. They also questioned about the dialogues of actress Kajol who plays the role of Savitribai Malusare. Thirdly, the right-wing organisation has also asserted that the team of Tanhaji seems to be trying to attempt to erase Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s all-comprehensive, profane image by showing the symbol OM on the saffron flag.</p>
      <p>“Movies should be made on historical topics, but we will not tolerate the distortion of historical incidents/ facts,” said Sambhaji Brigade in the letter.</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, Ajay plays the role of Tanhaji Malusare, while Saif Ali Khan essays the role of Udaybhan Rathod, who attacks the hill fortress Kondhana. The role of Shivaji Maharaj is characterised by Sharad Kelkar. Kajol essays the role of Tanhaji’s wife in the film.</p>
      <p><i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i>‘ will be released in 3D on January 10, 2020 and will also star Luke Kenny, Sharad Kelkar, Pankaj Tripathi among others.</p>
