      <h1>Ayahuasca Alters Brain Waves To Produce Waking Dream-Like State, Study Finds</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: <i>People under the influence of a psychedelic brew known as ayahuasca frequently experience vivid visual and aural hallucinations and also report feeling as if they are in a dream. Now a new study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51974-4?utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_medium=affiliate">published in Scientific Reports</a> has shown that the drug <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/ayahuasca-alters-brain-waves-to-produce-waking-dream-like-state-study-finds/">alters the user's waking brain-wave patterns to produce a mental state that the researchers describe as "dreaming while awake</a>." Ayahuasca is a bitter tea made from the Brazilian vine banisteriopsis caapi, colloquially known as the "spirit vine," used in shaman-led spiritual ceremonies among native people in the Amazon basin. Its primary active ingredient is dimethyltryptamine (DMT). That's the secret to ayahuasca's powerful psychedelic effects, which can also produce feelings of elation and fear or a sense of epiphany or psychological breakthrough. Those mind-altering properties come at a price, however. Participants in the ceremonies are often advised to bring a bucket, since nausea and vomiting (and sometimes diarrhea) are common reactions to the tea. <br/><br/>The current paper is the most recent study out of the [Imperial College London's Center for Psychedelic Research]. The study involved 13 subjects fitted with EEG caps and electrodes to monitor their brain activity while being given an IV infusion of DMT. The team found that the DMT caused a marked drop in alpha waves, a mark of wakefulness, along with a corresponding brief increase in theta brain waves, indicative of a dream state. Furthermore, while brain activity has been shown to decrease in subjects under the influence of psilocybin and LSD, the Imperial College researchers found more chaotic brain activity in subjects while under the influence of DMT. That might be why ayahuasca users report more vivid visual effects and a greater sense of immersion than is typically experienced with other psychedelics.</i></p>
