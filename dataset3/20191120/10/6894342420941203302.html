      <h1>realme 5S Now Official; Essentially realme 5 With 48MP Camera</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:00:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/195561/5realme-5-realme-5-pro-officially-in-malaysia-from-rm599/">realme 5</a> was announced alongside the realme 5 Pro, the latter having the 48MP camera. We can only assume there is demand for the realme 5 to also have a 48MP main shooter, because that’s what the company has recently announced in India. The new phone is called the realme 5S.</p>
      <p>As mentioned, the realme 5S is mostly identical to the standard realme 5. It comes with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 chipset, 5000mAh battery, and the same 13MP front facing camera. Three of the cameras on its quad-camera setup are also identical, comprising of an 8MP wide-angle camera, a 2MP protrait shooter, and a 2MP macro camera.</p>

      <p>One main difference between the two is very significant. The main camera on the realme 5S is now the same 48MP unit from the realme 5 Pro, rather than the 13MP one from the realme 5. That’s not all, and unfortunately the second difference seems like a compromise to the first. The display still measures 6.5 inches as the realme 5 did, but it seems to have gotten a cutback in resolution, down to HD+.</p>
      <p>Also, it looks like the realme 5S will have 4GB of RAM regardless of its storage capacity. On that note, the phone comes in either 64GB of storage, or 128GB. These are priced at INR9999 (~RM579) and INR1099 (~RM637), respectively. The realme 5S goes on sale in India starting 29 November. The company has not revealed if it will be bringing the phone toour shores.</p>
