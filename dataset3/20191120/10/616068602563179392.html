      <p>A small pond in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley billed as the "cradle of hockey" is up for sale.</p>
      <p>Long Pond, on the east side of Windsor, N.S., is recognized by some historians as the birthplace of the game, with evidence indicating a crude version of the sport was played there in the early 1800s.</p>
      <p>The asking price for the 10-hectare site is $1.38 million.</p>
      <p>The pond and surrounding land are owned by the Dill family, who operate a nearby farm famous for its giant pumpkins.</p>
      <p>Danny Dill, who owns the pond with his brother Andrew, says it's time for the family to focus on the farm — a 45-minute drive north Halifax.</p>
      <p>The family has also put together one of the largest collections of hockey memorabilia in Canada, which is displayed in a small museum on the farm.</p>
