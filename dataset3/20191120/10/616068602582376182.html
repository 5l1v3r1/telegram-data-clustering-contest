      <p>It was just two years ago when Vernon was named the ninth most dangerous city in all the nation.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/canadas-most-dangerous-places-2020/">McLeans report</a>, Vernon cracked the top 10 following a series of shootings and other crimes in 2016 that lead to the ranking in 2017.</p>
      <p>But last year, Vernon was ranked at No. 25 in the nation and this year it is even better.</p>
      <p>The McLeans crime severity index has Vernon at No. 44 for 2019.</p>
      <p>According to McLeans, “The report ranks communities according to the Cime Severity Index (CSI), a Statistics Canada measure of all police-reported crime, which takes into consideration both the volume and seriousness of offences. The 2018 data, the most current available, was released July 23, 2019.”</p>
      <p>The ranking takes a number of factors into consideration, but RCMP do not put much stock in the survey results.</p>
      <p>RCMP Const. Jocelyn Noseworthy said police are happy to see the city now ranked at 44, but noted a single incident in the city can boost the ranking.</p>
      <p>The rankings are based on crimes per 100,000 and a single incident can have a big impact on the end results.</p>
      <p>“We are super happy we are further down on the list, but I am not sure how much stock we put into it either,” said Noseworthy. “But it's great to see that we are going down.”</p>
      <p>Penticton was ranked No. 20, Kelowna 139 and Kamloops came in at 67.</p>
      <p>The top three most dangerous communities in Canada according to McLeans is Thompson, Man. at No. 1, a single point ahead of North Battleford, Sask. at No 2 and Portage La Prairie, Man. at No. 3.</p>
