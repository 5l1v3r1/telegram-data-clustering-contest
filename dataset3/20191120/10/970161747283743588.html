      <p>A Tory decision to rebrand their Twitter account as ‘FactCheckUK’ has been slammed as ‘dystopian’.</p>
      <p>Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis told Conservative Chairman James Cleverly: ‘You were misleading the public. Why would you have to change it to something that said Fact Check if people believed you when you just put CCHQ?’</p>
      <p>‘You dressed up party lines as a fact check service. That is dystopian.’</p>
      <p>During last night’s pre-election debate between <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> and Jeremy Corbyn,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/twitter-threatens-tories-misleading-fake-fact-check-account-11186118/"> the Tory Twitter account appeared to be trying to look like an independent fact checking service.</a></p>
      <p>It offered commentary on the Labour leader’s statements and retweeted messages supporting the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Tory Party chairman James Cleverly told BBC2’s Newsnight: ‘The Twitter handle of the CCHQ press office remained @CCHQPress so it’s clear the nature of the site.</p>

      <p>‘The reason we did that is because we were calling out the inaccuracies, the lies that were coming out during the debate. The NHS is not for sale.’</p>

      <p>He replied ‘I disagree’ when told the party had been misleading the public, and said the change would have been an idea from the party’s ‘digital team’.</p>
      <p>Asked if he knew about the change, Mr Cleverly said: ‘The digital team have got a remit, I set that remit, they work within the remit and I’m absolutely comfortable with them calling out when the Labour Party puts what they know to be complete fabrications in the public domain – and we will call that out every time they do it.’</p>

      <p>Twitter has warned that any further attempts to mislead the public on its platform during the UK General Election will lead to action.</p>
      <p>Several people who changed their account names to mock the Tory Party already saw their accounts suspended.</p>
      <p>Aaron Gillies, who tweets as @TechnicallyRon, said: ‘I pretended to be Fact Check UK for a few hours last night for a laugh and was locked out of my account and reported for impersonation. Guessing @CCHQPress had similar issues… Nah? Nope. Nothing has consequences anymore? Cool.’</p>
