      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-cure">The Cure</a> have announced that they’re auctioning a shirt worn by Robert Smith during the band’s ‘Disintegration’ era for charity.</p>
      <p>The distinctive black shirt will go under the hammer at Bonhams next month and is expected to sell for between £600-£800.</p>

      <p>It was worn by the singer during the band’s 1989 ‘Prayer’ tour in support of their classic album ‘Disintegration’, before making a return some 30 years later when the Crawley icons played the album in full across five nights <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-cures-blistering-disintegration-performance-upcoming-curaetion-25-anniversary-release-2538061">at the Sydney Opera House earlier this year. </a></p>

      <p>“I had five of these shirts made in 1989 for the Cure Prayer tour, and wore them at every show,” Smith commented.</p>
      <p>“I dug them out, had the tails shortened by a couple of inches and wore them again for the Disintegration shows earlier this year.”</p>
      <p>Smith has also signed the cuff of the shirt sleeve, ahead of it going under the hammer on December 17.</p>

      <p>This comes after Smith previously submitted <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-cure-robert-smith-artwork-auctioned-for-charity-the-anonymous-heart-project-2556001">an artistic postcard to a charity auction for Heart Research last month. </a></p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/cures-robert-smith-reveals-three-new-albums-2555094">he also revealed that three new Cure albums are currently in the works, </a>hinting that one of those records could be released before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“Actually I have prepared three albums, two of them more advanced. The first will be the one that we will release very soon. I think that the first single, or the whole album, will come out this Christmas, or a little earlier. It has the title of ‘Live From the Moon’ and it will surely change its name,” said Smith.</p>
