      <p>Aaron Carter had expanded his collection of guns as little as two months ago, but has been ordered to give up the weapons following a court ruling.</p>
      <p>The singer, 31, had appeared in court on Tuesday after his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/21/aaron-carters-sister-angel-accuses-fabricating-stories-nick-waits-miracle-baby-10782746/">twin sister Angel and brother Nick Carter had called for a restraining order against him</a> over ‘fears for their safety’.</p>
      <p>While his<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/17/aaron-carters-guns-wont-taken-away-unless-deemed-mentally-unstable-despite-family-fears-10759623/"> family had called police out to his home in September, law enforcement said they would not be restricting Aaron’s access to the weapons</a> unless he was deemed ‘mentally unstable’.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/aaron-carter-says-lost-everything-judge-rules-remove-gun-collection-court-11185679/">the judge decided on Tuesday that the weapons should be taken out of Aaron’s possession</a> as he was deemed ‘too dangerous’ to have access to them.</p>
      <p>Aaron had been photographed buying Smith &amp; Wesson assault rifles at a pawn shop in Antelope Valley, California, at the start of September and even gave fans a lesson in how to travel safely with the weapons on Instagram as they were loaded into the boot of his car.</p>

      <p>As well as the three guns, he also purchased a box of ammo on the same trip, which was seen in the boot next to the guns.</p>
      <p>Aaron had applied for a gun license just two weeks earlier, and according to TMZ had already bought a 9mm hand gun and two assault rifles once it was granted.</p>

      <p>The former child star had also reportedly inherited ‘500 guns’ from his dad, Bob, a US Marine veteran who died in 2017.</p>
      <p>The decision for Aaron’s guns to be removed came after he faced his sister in court, where he claimed she ‘lied over and over in an effort to take away [his] 2nd Amendment rights’.</p>

      <p>TMZ claims the singer was told he was ‘too dangerous to possess guns’, which led to him screaming at the judge that he would just go to another state in order to buy more if his were taken away.</p>
      <p>Aaron tweeted: ‘Lost my court case… lost everything … gotta move ASAP.’</p>
      <p>He had also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/aaron-carter-reveals-moving-canada-change-scenery-bizarrely-hitting-americans-10872911/">told fans that he was planning to move to Canada</a> in order to escape the ‘foul’ people who had not been treating him well.</p>
