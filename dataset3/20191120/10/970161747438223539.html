      <p>The Queen and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-philip/">Prince Philip</a> are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/20/queen-and-prince-philip-celebrate-71st-wedding-anniversary-8158219/">celebrating their wedding anniversary today.</a></p>
      <p>The royal couple have been married more than twice as long as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a> has been alive, tying the knot when the Queen was just 21 and the Duke 26.</p>
      <p>So how many years have they been married – and how is Prince Philip, who has retired from royal duties – spending his retirement?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>How long have the Queen and Prince Philip been married?</h3>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth II and Philip Mountbatten, Duke Of Edinburgh have been married for 72 years.</p>
      <p>Their wedding took place on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey, when the Queen was still Princess Elizabeth.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth’s dress was designed by the court designer Norman Hartnell, who was renowned for his embroidery – it was made of ivory silk with a floral design, decorated with crystals and 10,000 seed pearls.</p>

      <p>Although the Queen was heir apparent at the time, she still had to buy her wedding dress with ration coupons.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of members of the public sent Elizabeth their coupons to help her buy the dress, although it was no legal for her to use them so they were returned. Instead, the government donated 200 coupons to help her.</p>
      <p>The Queen’s tiara famously snapped on the morning of her wedding as she got ready at Buckingham Palace – leading to the court jeweler to be rushed to his work room by police escort, in order to fix it in time for the ceremony.</p>

      <p>The Duke, who is 98, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/02/today-is-prince-philips-last-official-day-before-retirement-6823142/">retired from public duties in 2017</a> after carrying out his last royal engagement at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>Since then he has only been seen in public a handful of times, including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/17/queen-prince-philip-going-royal-wedding-7553395/">at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding in May 2018</a>, and at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/12/bride-princess-eugenie-arrives-for-her-wedding-to-jack-brooksbank-8031373/">the wedding of Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank last October.</a></p>
      <p>Reports have said he has remained active during his retirement – with activities including fishing at Balmoral and driving round royal estates.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/09/prince-philip-97-voluntarily-given-driving-licence-following-crash-8497550/">However he gave up his driving licence earlier this year,</a> following an accident near the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.</p>
