      </p>
      <p>Forecasters say heavy rain over today and tomorrow will cause spot flooding, with accumulations of over 50mm possible in some parts of the two counties.</p>
      <p>The warning is valid from 3pm today until 6pm tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, a lower level status yellow rainfall warning will be in place for Kilkenny, Wexford and Cork over the same period.</p>
      <p>Met Éireann says spells of rain over the next two days mean spot flooding is likely.</p>
      <p>Nationally, outbreaks of rain are expected across the country today - heaviest in parts of Munster and south and east Leinster.</p>
      <p>The rain is expected to continue overnight and into tomorrow, with forecasters warning of a risk of spot flooding.</p>
