        <b>Jose Mourinho has made a surprising yet sensational return to Premier League after Tottenham <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277255-jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-manager-10-months-losing-man-united-job.html">announced him as their new manager.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese's appointment was confirmed on Wednesday, November 20, after Spurs showed Mauricio Pochettino the exit door.</p>
      <p>The Argentine manager spent five years with the London side, guiding them to their first Championship final which <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1241389-tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-mo-salah-origi-nets-reds-win-champions-league-reds.html">they lost to rivals Liverpool at Wanda Metropolitan</a> Stadium.</p>

      <p>However, Spurs' 'championship spirit' has irredeemably diminished following an alleged deluge of internal crisis that has seen the club take a drive back to their inglorious days, occupying 14th position on the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho was ushered in as his replacement on Wednesday, but the Portuguese manager's appointment has divided legion of football/Tottenham fans with many believing Mourinho's appointment is a big misstep.</p>
