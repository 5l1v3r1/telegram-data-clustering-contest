      <p>Jake Paul has slammed ‘butt hurt’ fans after he was criticised for hanging out with his ex-girlfriend Erika Costell.</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>
      <p>The YouTube star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/26/jake-paul-tana-mongeau-reveal-lavish-500000-wedding-talk-best-man-bridesmaids-vows-10469897/">who married </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tana-mongeau/">Tana Mongeau</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/26/jake-paul-tana-mongeau-reveal-lavish-500000-wedding-talk-best-man-bridesmaids-vows-10469897/"> earlier this year</a>, caused a bit of a stir after he was spotted out in LA with his ex various times over the past few months.</p>
      <p>With a fan asking him why they were together during an Instagram Q and A, Jake looked exasperated.</p>

      <p>‘Exes can be friends, right?’ he asked. ‘Or just because “stans” don’t like that and get butt hurt we’re not supposed to be?’</p>
      <p>Well, that’s that then.</p>
      <p>Drama was stirred up again after a fan spotted the pair of them together in a car, snapping a photo.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/07/ksi-savagely-trolls-jake-paul-as-youtuber-reveals-he-can-barely-hold-it-together-following-split-with-erika-costell-8116355/">split from Erika back in November 2018</a>, after just six months of officially dating.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Jake went on to say he could ‘barely hold it together’ in a statement after the public break-up.</p>
      <p>‘Erika is such a beautiful soul &amp; she truly changed my life,’ he wrote. ‘She is a powerful, smart &amp; independent woman, who has such a bright future ahead of her and has helped me become a better person on multiple levels.</p>

      <p>‘The times we had together are irreplaceable and I will be forever grateful that she was part of my life.’</p>
      <p>Then, back in August, just weeks after he married his beau Tana, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/20/tana-mongeau-throws-major-shade-husband-jake-paul-spotted-ex-girlfriend-erika-costell-10599121/">Team 10’s Sunny Malouf casually posted a video of herself and the pair lip-syncing</a> to Snoop Dogg, Bruno Mars and Wiz Khalifa’s track Young Wild And Free.</p>
      <p>Bit awkward.</p>

      <p>Tana made her feelings clear on the reunion when she tweeted: ‘Lmao wtf,’ before her ex-girlfriend Bella Thorne weighed in on the situation.</p>

      <p>She went on to appear on Bella’s Instagram Stories, giggling as she parodied Ariana Grande’s Thank U, Next about her exes.</p>
      <p>‘Thought I’d end up with Bella, yet it wasn’t a match,’ she sang. ‘Wrote some songs about Hunter, now I listen and laugh.</p>
      <p>‘Even actually got married and for Jake I’m so thankful, except when he goes out to lunch with his ex and I find out on Twitter.’</p>
      <p>Real talk though, it’s a bop.</p>
