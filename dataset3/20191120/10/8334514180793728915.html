      <p>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dozens of hospitals throughout the Netherlands closed for anything but the most urgent cases on Wednesday, as nurses and doctors went on strike demanding higher pay and better working conditions.</p>
      <p>Hospital workers are demanding a general wage hike of 5%, higher bonuses for unexpected extra work and measures to relieve their workload.</p>
      <p>The Dutch association of hospitals has so far offered around 3% extra pay and wishes to scrap the employers’ contribution to health insurance and to lower pay during sick leave.</p>
      <p>The association has said the unions’ demands would cost hospitals 950 million euros ($1.05 billion), which they say is around 200 million euros more than they have to offer.</p>
      <p>Unions say higher salaries and better working conditions would help make hospital work more attractive, as an ageing population and rising life expectancy look set to lead to a shortage of at least 100,000 care workers in the Netherlands by 2022.</p>
