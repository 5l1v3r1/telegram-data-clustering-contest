      <h1>This Alien: Isolation mod fills the space station with xenomorphs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:31:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p>Like the original movie, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/alien-isolation/">Alien: Isolation</a> does a lot with a single monster that we're only exposed to in brief, terrifying moments before we run off and hide. Apparently some people think that's a walk in the park, though, and now a modder is catering to them by filling Sevastopol with more xenomorph chums. </p>
      <p>Modder Matt Flier's Aliens: Isolation mod, as the extra 's' implies, will pit you against a horde of alien nasties, but unlike the second movie you won't be accompanied by a bunch of gun-toting marines helpfully willing to die in your place. </p>
      <p>Aliens: Isolation is still in development, so you can't experience the nightmare quite yet, but you can take a look at the short preview video below.  </p>

      <p>I found it stressful enough hiding from one xenomorph, so a whole hive of them is probably too much for my frayed nerves. Unlike Aliens, where an increase in action and decrease in tension accompanied the additional xenomorphs, Aliens: Isolation remains a survival horror romp, and just one of them spotting you will still be very bad news. </p>
      <p>Seeing them all just hanging around a flare, utterly fascinated, does make them a bit less menacing and more like a bunch of big doofuses, though, right up until the moment one of them turns around and clocks its next victim. </p>
      <p>More details on Aliens: Isolation will be revealed soon.</p>
