      </p>
      <p>McLaren have looked like the McLaren of old this season and Sainz has been the catalyst for the Woking-based team in their climb back up the Formula 1 grid. They have all but secured P4 in the Constructors' Championship and Sunday was the highlight of their 2019.</p>
      <p>Sainz started down in P20 after not being able to record a lap time in qualifying due to engine issues, but the Spanish driver drove a remarkable race and climbed all the way up to P4 in Brazil and due to Hamilton's incident with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon%20">Alex Albon</a>, the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team%20">Mercedes</a> driver was given a five-second penalty and the McLaren man was lifted into the top three.</p>
      <p><i>"I'm happy for the entire team, everyone has done so much work throughout the year," </i>Seidl said to <i>Sky Sports F1. "Performing P4 for us is a big step forward, and a great motivation for all of us to keep working hard with the clear aim that at some point, that we fight for podiums down to our own outright performance."</i></p>
      <p>On Sainz's first-ever podium finish, Seidl said: <i>"He's done a sensational job all year and he deserves it."</i></p>
