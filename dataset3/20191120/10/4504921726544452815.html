      <p>AC Boxing Promotions was launched on Tuesday in the capital and its promoters already have some exciting plans up their sleeves.<br/>Founder of AC Boxing, Immanuel Moses - better known as Imms - called the launch a dream come true.<br/>He stated that the stable will not only cater for AC Boxing Academy boxers , but will also look to promote young talent across the country.<br/>” In 2016 we started with a boxing academy and gym under AC Sports and Entertainment, we then followed it up with a radio show which helped us engage with the public especially in letting people know what boxing was all about. I believe I can groom boxers until continental heights.<br/>He said he has to get someone who will then take these boxers to international levels.<br/>Internationally he will work with the likes of Global Boxing Stars Promotions who are close to Viva Manny Pacquiao Promotion.<br/>In addition to AC Promotions being the newest boxing promotors on the block, they also announced their first event with a total of 8 fights on the cards.<br/>The boxing bonanza titled “Rising Stars of Africa” is scheduled for the 6th of December at the Paragon Crescent Suits in Windhoek.<br/>The main fight of the evening will feature Sakaria “Desert Storm” Lukas taking on Yamikiani Mkandawire from Malawi in an 8 round featherweight bout.<br/>A Namibian businessman John Endjala, has been unveiled as the patron of AC Promotions and his wife Penny Endjala delivered his speech on his behalf.<br/>“Imms decided to take the bull by the horns to support the government to create jobs for Namibian youths. He already has 10 professional boxers and 40 amateurs under his banner, which is highly encouraging, and he gives us great hope as business people,” Endjala said.<br/>In attendance was also a board member of the Namibia Professional Boxing and Wrestling Control Board Thomas Mabuku who congratulated Paulus on his achievement. Adding that it is a blessing to the board and is looking forward to work with him.<br/>General tickets are available to the public at 200 Namibia Dollars, while ten thousand get you a VIP table seating ten.</p>
