      <h1>Proposed electorate boundaries released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:46:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Representation_Commission" target="_blank">Representation Commission</a></address>

      <p>Representation Commission</p>
      <p>Te Komihana Whakatau Rohe Pōti</p>
      <p>The Representation Commission is proposing changes to half of New Zealand’s electorates and establishing a new electorate in south Auckland.</p>
      <p>The Commission has released its report today on the proposed boundaries and names of electorates for the next two general elections. The public will now be able to have their say before the boundaries are finalised in April 2020.</p>
      <p>“Where possible the current boundaries have been retained to minimise the number of people affected by electorate boundary and name changes. Of the 71 existing electorates, 36 are unchanged. The adjustments in other electorates reflect changes in population since 2014 when the boundaries were last reviewed,” says Representation Commission chair Judge Craig Thompson.</p>
      <p>The biggest areas of change are in the Auckland region, Christchurch, and Otago and Southland.</p>
      <p>“In the Auckland region, the total number of general electorates increases from 24 to 25. The new electorate we’ve proposed is called Flat Bush. It takes in parts of the existing Hunua, Manurewa and Papakura electorates,” says Judge Thompson.</p>
      <p>“Boundary changes are needed to electorates in the Christchurch area because of significant population growth in Selwyn, which is the fastest growing electorate in the country.”</p>
      <p>In Otago and Southland, adjustments are needed to the boundaries of the Waitaki, Dunedin North, Dunedin South, Clutha-Southland and Invercargill electorates.</p>
      <p>More detail on all the proposed changes is available online at <a href="http://vote.nz/">vote.nz</a> and in the Proposed Electorates 2019 report available at libraries, council offices, Electoral Commission offices and Te Puni Kōkiri regional offices.</p>
      <p>“We encourage people to have a closer look at the changes and what it means for them. The public can make objections on the proposed boundaries and names until 20 December,” says Judge Thompson. There will be a counter-objections period from 10 to 24 January, and public hearings will be held in February.</p>
      <p>The main changes that have been proposed by the Representation Commission are:</p>
      <p>
        <b>North Island general electorates</b>

      <p>• The addition of population to<b> New Lynn</b> from the north means changes are also required to<b> Mt Roskill, Maungakiekie, Manukau East,</b> and <b>Manurewa</b></p>

      </p>
      <p>• Brightwater is moved from <b>Nelson</b> to <b>West Coast-Tasman</b></p>
      <p>• <b>Selwyn</b> is redrawn and no longer includes Banks Peninsula. Adjustments are also made to <b>Ilam, Wigram, Port Hills</b> (renamed <b>Banks Peninsula</b>), <b>Christchurch East</b> and <b>Rangitata</b></p>
      <p>• <b>Clutha-Southland </b>gains<b> </b>the Alexandra and Clyde area from <b>Waitaki</b></p>

      <p>• Winton and The Catlins are added to <b>Invercargill</b> from <b>Clutha-Southland.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Māori electorates</b>
      </p>
      <p>• <b>Tāmaki Makaurau</b> gains an area around Te Atatū South from<b> Te Tai Tokerau</b> and an area in East Manurewa from <b>Hauraki Waikato</b></p>
      <p>• A minor adjustment between <b>Ikaroa-Rāwhiti</b> and <b>Te Tai Tonga</b> is made in Naenae.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Names of electorates</b>
      </p>
      <p>Four electorate name changes are proposed: <b>Rodney</b> to <b>Whangaparāoa</b>, <b>Hunua</b> to <b>Port Waikato</b>, <b>Rimutaka</b> to <b>Remutaka </b>and <b>Port Hills</b> to <b>Banks Peninsula</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Number of electorates</b>
      </p>
      <p>The number of electorates increases from 71 to 72. The number of general electorates in the South Island is fixed at 16, the number of general electorates in the North Island increases from 48 to 49, and the number of Māori electorates remains unchanged at seven.</p>
