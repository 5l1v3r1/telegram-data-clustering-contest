      <p>ITV's Lorraine Kelly admits she was left unimpressed with last night's leaders' debate, describing Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn's stint as "underwhelming".</p>
      <p>Speaking to Susanna and Piers on Good Morning Britain earlier today she confirmed she had watched the Labour leader battle it out with the Conservative leader in the first live debate ahead of the general election on December 12 last night.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old then went on to offer her savage verdict on the debate shortly after on her own show.</p>

      <p>Discussing the political TV clash with Good Morning Britain's political correspondent Ranvir Singh she classed it as "underwhelming" and asked Ranvir: "Who do you think was the least worst?"</p>
      <p>To which the GMB reporter replied: "I think if you were undecided before watching the debate, you probably ended an hour later still undecided - I don't think it necessarily helped many people make a decision.</p>
      <p>"And the point of those debates is to help undecided voters think one way or the other."</p>

        <figcaption>Lorraine described the party leaders' handshake as 'excruciating'.</figcaption>

      <p>Lorraine was also unimpressed with the party leaders' heavy use of slogans and noted how both were often 'mocked' and 'laughed at' by the audience.</p>
      <p>"That handshake though," She added. "How ghastly was that.</p>
      <p>"That kind of summed it all up really, it was so excruciating. I don't know why they had to do that, it was horrible."</p>
      <p>The Scottish mum-of-one told viewers how she felt she hadn't really learned anything from the debate and was baffled by the leaders' choice to talk to each other about Christmas presents.</p>
      <p>"I just felt like I hadn't learnt anything!" She said. "And then at the end when they were talking about Christmas presents - you just think 'for the love of God'.</p>

      <p>Besides last night's debate, Lorraine was also left unimpressed by a certain GMB guest earlier this week.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the ITV host went all in when Boris Johnson's 'friend' Jennifer Arcuri appeared on the breakfast show.</p>
      <p>Jennifer was quizzed by Lorraine and avoided answering claims that she had an affair with Boris.</p>
      <p>Jennifer was still on air as Lorraine said: "God, that was crazy, wasn't it? What's the point? Coming on and not answering any questions?</p>
      <p>"What's the point in you coming on air to clear the air and not saying anything."</p>
      <p>Jennifer responded: "I'm sorry?"</p>
      <p>Lorraine said: "You didn't answer any of the questions put to you, I donâ€™t see the point of you being on... anyway."</p>
      <p>Piers and Susanna were left astonished by Lorraine's outburst and are now calling her outspoken opinions as 'the Lorraine moment'.</p>
