      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GarethBale">Gareth Bale</a> incensed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RealMadrid">Real Madrid</a> supporters after posing with a “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order” flag after their <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> victory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/wales-vs-hungary-result-score-goals-euro-2020-draw-aaron-ramsey-a9209891.html">Aaron Ramsey’s double against Hungary</a> ensured Ryan Giggs’ side of qualification for next summer’s tournament on Tuesday night. </p>
      <p>Bale has been targeted with repeated criticism for his love of golf throughout his time in Madrid, with a columnist in Spanish newspaper <i>AS </i>recently claiming: ”The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid.”</p>
      <p>Wales’ fans quickly turned the slight into a chant for their captain, who admitted he finds it “amusing” ahead of the game.</p>
      <p>Then, as Wales celebrated their victory at the Cardiff City Stadium, the entire squad posed in front of a banner with the quote on.</p>
      <p>Bale has not played for Madrid since 5 October and his return to international duty was sarcastically dubbed “the miracle in Wales” by some members of the Spanish press.</p>
      <p>A poll by <i>Marca </i>last night found that 75 per cent of Madrid supporters found Bale’s celebration showed a “lack of respect for the club and fans”.</p>
      <p>“I’ve heard some stories but I don’t really take notice,” Bale said earlier this week. “My friends tend to send me some funny pictures or whatever they write.</p>
      <p>“I find it hilarious to be honest, especially some of the pictures and stuff my friends send me. On one, it said ‘triple bogey’ and I’ve never had a triple bogey! At least give me an albatross! It’s funny.</p>
      <p>“Maybe to them [the Spanish media] it doesn’t look great but it’s just a kind of coincidence that the national team comes around this week and I’ve returned to full training.</p>
      <p>“If I’m fit, no matter where I am, I’m going to try to play, whether it be for Wales or Madrid. For me it was a no-brainer: if I’m fit to play then I’ll give it my all.”</p>
