      <p>Malta police on Wednesday arrested a businessman in connection with the 2017 murder of investigative journalist and blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia, a police source told<i> AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>Maltese national Yorgen Fenech was detained on his yacht at dawn as he tried to leave Malta the day after an alleged middleman was offered a pardon if he identified the assassination’s mastermind, the source said.</p>
      <p>“We have arrested a man as part of our investigations into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia,” a high-ranking police source told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>“He was on his boat at the time of arrest,” the source said, defining Fenech as “a person of interest” in the case.</p>
      <p>Fenech is the director and co-owner of Electrogas, which won a multi-million euro contract from the Maltese state in 2013 to build a new gas power station on the tiny Mediterranean island.</p>
      <p>Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit also identified him as the owner of a company based in Dubai called 17 Black.</p>
      <p>Journalist Caruana Galizia, killed by a car bomb, had written in her blog about 17 Black some eight months before her death, alleging it was connected to Maltese politicians.</p>
      <p>Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said Tuesday he had promised the alleged middleman a pardon if he named the person who ordered her death.</p>
