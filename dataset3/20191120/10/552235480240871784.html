      <h2>Police combed the wooded area for the missing woman, who vanished in 2017.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:43:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:43</time> by <a rel="author">Alison Rennie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/alison-rennie/</a></address>
      <p>Police were yesterday combing the Gleniffer Braes in a bid to find the body of missing mum <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/cops-fear-missing-paisley-mum-17369485">Patricia Henry</a>.</p>
      <p>Patricia, who was known as Patti, vanished in November 2017.</p>
      <p>Her family reported her missing have since made several heartfelt appeals for information.</p>
      <p>Cops spent months searching a property in Burnfoot Crescent, Glenburn, and the flat she moved to in Girvan, but found no trace.</p>
      <p>Now the <a href="http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/">Paisley Daily Express</a> understands the search for her body is focused on an area of the Gleniffer Braes.</p>
      <p>A team of officers spent around an hour in sub-zero temperatures digging through the undergrowth of a dense pocket of woodland on Braehead Road near to Paisley Golf Club.</p>
      <p>Police tape was tied to trees as markers during the morning search, which failed to uncover any further clues.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “A search has been taking place in the Paisley area which relates to the death of 47-year-old Paisley woman Patricia <br/>Henry.</p>
      <p>“She was last seen in her home in November 2017.</p>
      <p>“A 69-year-old man was arrested in July this year in connection with this death.”</p>
      <p>Patti was officially reported missing by family 20 months ago but was last seen on November 13, 2017 in the Girvan area.</p>

      <p>Family members, including Patti’s daughter Alannah, handed out leaflets to members of the public in Glenburn in April in a bid to generate fresh information about her whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Detectives have also spoken to hundreds of people in both Girvan and Paisley in an effort to establish where she could be.</p>
      <p>As her family marked two years since they last saw Patti, last week her devastated brother Stephen told the Paisley Daily Express: “We all miss her so much. We miss her all the time.</p>

      <p>“She was a pain in the backside but she was our pain in the backside.</p>
      <p>“The last two years without her have been so difficult for the whole family.</p>
      <p>“It’s been torture really. It doesn’t get any easier with time, that’s for sure.”</p>
      <p>Stephen, from Paisley, explained how the whole family has been affected.</p>
      <p>He said: “The knock-on effect has been massive for everyone.</p>
      <p>“We think about her all the time.”</p>
