      <h1>50 Cent Lusts Over Lizzo &amp; Taunts Drake Upon Return To Instagram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:02:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53401/title.50-cent-tank-spark-instagram-debate-over-male-oral-sex-laws">50 Cent</a> has been absent from Instagram for the past week following a sparring session with fellow <i>Power</i> actor<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53495/title.naturi-naughton-clap-backs-at-50-cents-mortal-kombat-meme"> Naturi Naughton.</a> Evidently, his hiatus is over and the infamous social media troll has made his triumphant return to the platform.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday (November 20), Fiddy shared several new posts, but the most recent one finds him lusting over Lizzo, who was just nominated for eight <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53530/title.2020-grammy-award-nominations-are-here">Grammy Awards. </a>He also managed to drag <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53437/title.drake-returns-with-epic-comeback-after-hes-booed-off-camp-flog-gnaw-stage">Drake</a> into it.</p>
      <p>“@lizzobeeating booty look good,” he wrote alongside a suggestive video of the singer. “I just saw @champagnepapi look at it. Lol.”</p>

      <p>50 claimed he <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53463/title.50-cent-tweets-absolute-randomness-after-instagram-account-gets-shut-down">deactivated his account</a> last week, albeit the timing was interesting considering he’d been accused of bullying Naughton in the days leading up to his Instagram disappearing act.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, he<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53512/title.50-cent-denies-bullying-power-co-star-naturi-naughton"> denied mistreating his co-star,</a> tweeting, “I was sticking up for her, they just went and made some shit up.”</p>
      <p>In addition to his recent Lizzo post, <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53401/title.50-cent-tank-spark-instagram-debate-over-male-oral-sex-laws">the <i>Power</i> executive producer</a> also commemorated his return with a Rick James meme and another lightweight jab at Naughton.</p>
