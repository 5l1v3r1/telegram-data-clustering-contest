      <p>Maltese authorities have arrested a prominent businessman who appears to be a “person of interest” in the assassination of a leading investigative reporter.</p>
      <p>Yorgen Fenech was on a yacht that was intercepted sailing northwards away from Malta by the military early on Wednesday and forced back to port.</p>
      <p>In remarks to reporters, prime minister Joseph Muscat did not directly tie the arrest to the murder of 53-year-old Daphne Caruana Galizia in a car bombing in October 2017, but he said it appeared to result from comments he made a day earlier the possibility of a pardon for an alleged middleman who had offered to identify the mastermind of the killing.</p>

      <p>Mr Muscat said he instructed police to be on the lookout for unusual actions by “people of interest” in the long-unsolved murder, after announcing on Tuesday that a pardon would be possible for the middleman if information he provided could stand up in court.</p>
      <p>“If I had not given these instructions, maybe today we might be speaking of persons of interest who might have escaped,” the PM told reporters.</p>
      <p>No details of charges against Fenech have been revealed, but authorities would have 48 hours to decide on them.</p>
      <p>Fenech is a prominent hotelier and director of the Maltese power company. His name was on leaked documents as a source of income for companies named in the Panama Papers.</p>
