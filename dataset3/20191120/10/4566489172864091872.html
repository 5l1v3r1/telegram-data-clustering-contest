      <h1>US gifts new security vessel to Vietnam, vows S. China Sea presence</h1>

      <p>The United States is giving Vietnam's coast guard a second cutter vessel, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday, vowing to maintain a routine military presence in the flashpoint South China Sea.</p>
      <p>The new security ship "represents another concrete symbol of our strengthening relationship", Esper said at the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam after a tour through South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Washington wants to counter Beijing's expanding influence in the region and the fiercely contested South China Sea is a source of major tension.</p>
      <p>China has built military installations, rammed vessels and sent survey ships into disputed territory in the resource-rich waterway, parts of which are also claimed by several Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The US has hit out with so-called "freedom of navigation" forays into the waters and the first-ever joint maritime drills with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year.</p>
      <p>Esper, who was confirmed as President Donald Trump's defence secretary in July, said similar activities will continue.</p>
      <p>"We will also maintain a routine military presence in the South China Sea, to demonstrate the seriousness of our commitment," he said, adding that the US will "fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows".</p>
      <p>Esper and his Chinese counterpart met at a security summit in Bangkok on Monday.</p>
      <p>In a briefing afterwards Wu Qian, a spokesman for Chinese Ministry of National Defence, urged the US to "stop military provocation in the South China Sea".</p>
      <p>The cutter vessel, which will be handed over next year, is the latest example of ramped up political and defence links between the US and Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Washington handed over six patrol boats and equipment worth $12 million, the third of a planned four deliveries.</p>
      <p>Security and trade ties between the former wartime foes deepened after Washington and Hanoi restored diplomatic ties in 1995.</p>
