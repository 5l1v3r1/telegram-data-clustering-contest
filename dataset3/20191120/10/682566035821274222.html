      <p>Cape Town - The <b>South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC)</b> Council will elect a new vice-president and a board member this weekend.</p>
      <p><b>Athletics South Africa (ASA)</b> released a statement on Wednesday backing their president <b>Aleck Skhosana </b>to "save the sinking ship that SASCOC is".</p>
      <p>"... We are way too confident that a majority vote for Skhosana as vice president will bring the urgency and stability needed to control the downward spiral of the once revered Olympic body," said the press release.</p>
      <p>"ASA believes that currently both the delivery and quality on standards and expectations at Sascoc are unacceptable. Federations need a leadership that will respect them and make them part of the decisions and not isolate or take the constituency for granted. </p>
      <p>"We need a SASCOC that understands that each sporting code is unique and that a blanket approach to every problem and situation is what has sunk the organisation to its low ebb. We fully trust that as our nominee, an elected Skhosana will be a leader for all who will bring back the confidence needed in the SASCOC board, respected by athletes, coaches, managers, and sponsors and attract potential sponsors.</p>
      <p>"It is without doubt that, while we don't agree with the selection of athletes for joy rides, the time has come for restructuring and improvement at SASCOC. We need a robust discussion of the selection criteria which we believe the SASCOC leadership is approaching the wrong way.</p>
      <p>"Athletes and South Africa are looking to us as federations at the Special General Meeting to vote for change and a leadership that will seek sporting excellence at every opportunity," the press release ended.</p>
