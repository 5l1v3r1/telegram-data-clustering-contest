      <p>A prolific shoplifter has been banned from going into every single shop across England apart from a Tesco Metro.</p>
      <p>Anna Burns, 33, took a suitcase with her to Swindon Crown Court yesterday, expecting that she would be jailed.</p>
      <p>However, Judge Peter Crabtree told her that he was going to look at all options and released her with strict conditions.</p>
      <p>She can only use the NHS Walk-in Centre near her home and Tesco in The Parade, Swindon.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Someone needs to do something that stops you repeatedly committing offences and coming back. That may be custody but I will look at all options.’</p>
      <p>She appeared before Magistrates on Saturday following her latest haul of £347 in goods from M&amp;S and and Sainsbury’s.</p>
      <p>The court heard that she was already wanted by the court after failing to turn up for an <a href="https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/18047775.swindon-shoplifter-given-final-chance-stay-prison/">earlier hearing</a>.</p>

      <p>She was in court recently for stealing mascara from Boots, watches from Argos, clothes from Mothercare and food and drink from Costa.</p>
      <p>But during the hearing she complained that she was unwell and was bailed to the end of the week so that she could go to a nearby walk-in centre.</p>
      <p>She went there with a probation officer but after being told she would have to wait half an hour Burns said she wanted to go home to charge her phone so that she could call an ambulance.</p>
      <p>Judge Crabtree told her: ‘Make sure you are here. I think you’ve managed to get here once out of about a dozen occasions on time.’</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 16, she appeared in the dock at Swindon Magistrates’ Court, where she pleaded guilty to stealing £307-worth of goods from Marks and Spencer’s and £40-worth from Sainsbury’s.</p>
