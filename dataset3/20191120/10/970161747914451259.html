        <b>James Corden gave the LA Lakers cheerleaders a run for their money when he joined the dance troupe at the basketball team’s game last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Late Late Show host donned the cheerleading team’s golden kit and hit the Staples Center court on Tuesday evening ahead of the Lakers’ game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>Taking center stage, James absolutely slayed the choreography and managed to keep up with the actual cheerleading team as they danced to Zedd and Alessia Cara’s Stay.</p>
      <p>James was joined by tennis star Venus Williams and former New England Patriots player Rob Gronkowski who also did well in keeping up with the beat, but the British talk show host was the undeniable winner thanks to his on-point body rolls and twirls.</p>
      <p>Basically it was the Bring It On sequel we’ve craved.</p>
      <p>It came just hours after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/new-cats-trailer-still-going-haunt-dreams-get-better-glimpse-james-corden-taylor-swift-felines-11183293/">the new Cats trailer emerged starring James as Bustopher Jones</a>, following the ‘creepy’ original trailer which has haunted everyone’s dreams.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The first teaser clip garnered much criticism with many struggling to adjust to seeing James and his co-stars like Taylor Swift, Idris Elba and Dame Judi Dench as half-human and half-furry cats.</p>

      <p>However the second trailer is a slight improvement, giving us a better glimpse at the other cast members including Jason Derulo (Rum Tum Tugger), Ian McKellen (Gus The Theatre Cat) and Rebel Wilson (Jennyanydots).</p>
      <p>The film will follow the tale of the Jellicle cats as they hold the ball for Old Deuteronomy (Dench) who will pick which feline to take to the Heaviside Layer and onto a better life.</p>
      <p>Jason Derulo addressed the reaction to the first trailer this week and told Australian publication Confidential: ‘I don’t think I have ever seen such a polarising reaction from any other trailer ever.</p>
      <p>‘I knew that was what it would be from the jump and that is what I hoped it would be because that is what I felt like was the magic of the stage play.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘It is unlike anything that you’ve ever seen before so everything that has been said about it being creepy or left and weird, it is all of that and more.’</p>
