        <b>Xbox is pushing out a new “Buy from Guide” feature for Xbox One consoles to allow gamers to quickly play the same games their friends are.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Announced by Xbox’s Larry <i>Major Nelson </i>Hyrb, the feature should begin rolling out to Xbox players now.</p>
      <p>The surprise announcement took us off guard for sure, but as a way to drive purchases of anticipated games through digital peer pressure, it’s a smart move. If you see your entire friends list playing the same game at once, you may be tempted to pick it up too in a regrettable snap decision!</p>

      <p>The Buy from Guide feature appears to work smoothly. If you click on a friend who’s playing a game, the first option will allow you to buy or install the game that they’re playing. It’s the same pop-up as installing an Xbox Game Pass title; you can even go straight to the game’s Xbox Clubs page.</p>
      <p>“We are starting to roll out a new feature for Xbox One,” Hyrb announced on Twitter. “Directly from the Guide you will be able to quickly get more information on a game your friend is playing – with a link to play it (if installed), install (if you own it) or buy it + a link to the official club.”</p>

      <p>While some are for the feature, others aren’t so enamoured with it. “This is awfu,” one user said. “I dont want a link to buy a game every time I look at what my friends are doing.”</p>
      <p>“That’s a brilliant feature, the buy-it-now option,” another said. “I always wondered why it didn’t work that way. You’ve missed a lot of impulse purchases.”</p>
