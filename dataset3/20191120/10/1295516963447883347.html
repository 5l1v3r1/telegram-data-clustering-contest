      <h1>Joker Director Wants to Helm Even More DC Character Origin Story Films</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:11:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Renaldo Matadeen</a></address>
      <p>Following the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-movie-1-billion-box-office/">billion-dollar success</a> of Todd Phillips' <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker-film/">Joker</a></i>, the director now reportedly wants to tell origin stories for a slew of other DC characters.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">THR</a></i>, Phillips -- who's in talks to return for a <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-sequel-works-todd-phillips-talks/">Joker</a></i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-sequel-works-todd-phillips-talks/"> sequel</a> -- approached Warner Bros. to develop a portfolio of other origin stories in the same vein as he did for Joaquin Phoenix's Clown Prince of Crime.</p>

      <p>It's believed Phillips has a vision for standalone stories outside of main DC film continuity, as seen with his Arthur Fleck, who descended into madness by the end of <i>Joker</i>. Ironically, Phillips did tinker with one superhero origin story, as his film concluded with the murder of the Waynes in the Joker riots. This gave rise to the birth of Batman, who was hinted to be <a href="https://screenrant.com/joker-movie-thomas-wayne-arthur-fleck-father/">Arthur's half-brother</a> in a formative story disconnected from Matt Reeve's <i>Batman</i> solo affair.</p>

      <p>While details are scarce on what exactly Phillips is proposing and if he'll write and/or direct the other origin movies himself, fans are already putting forward character studies on the likes of Metropolis megalomaniac Lex Luthor, with some tossing even more outlandish names like Darkseid into the mix.</p>
