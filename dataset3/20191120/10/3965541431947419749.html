      <p>Hackers are breaking into loyalty rewards accounts and stealing those hard-earned points and miles.</p>
      <p>"Basically, it's like stealing cash from you," said John Breyault, who runs the website<a href="https://www.fraud.org/frequent_flyer_alert"> Fraud.org</a>.</p>
      <p>Loyalty accounts tend to be relatively easy to attack because a lot of people don't have strong passwords on them.</p>
      <p>If that's you, create a new, unique, and strong password that's hard to hack. Then, set-up two-factor authentication at sites that offer it.</p>
      <p>"That's a way to put a lock on these accounts, so that it's much harder for scammers to get in there and steal your points," Breyault explained. "It [two-factor authentication] might slow you down a few seconds when you first log in, but trust me, it's worth it."</p>
      <p>Be sure to safeguard your frequent flier or loyalty account numbers. Boarding passes and hotel invoices usually have your account number printed on them. Always shred these documents after your trip. And don't put your frequent flier number on your luggage tags.</p>
      <p>One more tip: Use your rewards.</p>
      <p>"There are literally trillions of frequent flier miles and hotel points floating around unused, so our advice is that if you have miles or points, make sure you use them," Breyault told me.</p>
