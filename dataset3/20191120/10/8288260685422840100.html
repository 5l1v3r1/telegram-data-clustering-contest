      <p>Lorraine Kelly was left unimpressed with the "underwhelming" ITV Leaders Debate.</p>
      <p>The Scottish TV presenter was among millions of Brits tuning into the hour-long debate on ITV1 last night.</p>
      <p>The debate, on Tuesday, November 19, saw Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson do battle - with YouGov calling it a virtual "tie".</p>
      <p>Today, Lorraine spoke out on her ITV1 daytime show, giving her savage verdict on the Labour and Tory leaders' contest.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old, speaking to Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain, classed it as "underwhelming" and asked Ranvir Singh: "Who do you think was the least worst?"</p>

      <p>The GMB reporter replied: "I think if you were undecided before watching the debate, you probably ended an hour later still undecided - I don't think it necessarily helped many people make a decision.</p>
      <p>"And the point of those debates is to help undecided voters think one way or the other."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"That handshake though," Lorraine added.</p>
      <p>"How ghastly was that.</p>
      <p>"That kind of summed it all up really, it was so excruciating. I don't know why they had to do that, it was horrible."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Scottish mum-of-one then said: "I just felt like I hadn't learnt anything!"</p>
      <p>"And then at the end when they were talking about Christmas presents - you just think 'for the love of God'.</p>
