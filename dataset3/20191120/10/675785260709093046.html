      <p>A mum murdered her boyfriend’s eight-year-old daughter by kicking her until her intestines ripped and she could no longer walk.</p>
      <p>Cynthia Baker, 41, subjected Rica Roundtree to "wanton cruelty" and abuse, a court heard.</p>
      <p>The evil mum battered little Rica at her home in Illinois, America, for "entertainment" and treated her as a "punching bag".</p>
      <p>Sickening evidence from court heard how Rica suffered intestinal perforation up to five days before she was rushed to a hospital, where she died on January 26.</p>
      <p>In the days leading to her death, Rica had vomited, could no longer see and almost fell down a set of stairs.</p>
      <p>Forensic pathologist Dr John Denton found the youngster had more than 50 injuries across he body.</p>
      <p>Following Baker's arrest, detectives found harrowing footage of three attacks she had inflicted on Rica during in 2018.</p>

      <p>The abuse included hitting parts of her body, hitting her head against walls and kneeing her in the back.</p>
      <p>One clip appeared to show Baker using a twisted 'discipline' method on Rica - who was seen naked while struggling to hold two cans in her arms, which are stretched far apart.</p>
      <p>Baker, who was found guilty of first degree murder, could be heard mocking the girl and telling her to keep her arms straight.</p>
      <p>She says: “Cold, aren’t you? Good,” and later asked Rica if she should put a collar on her, reports <a href="https://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/wanton-cruelty-baker-may-face-life-sentence-in--year/article_dfd26d1c-a180-5598-8e01-4294ce7ca6d9.html">Pantagraph.</a></p>

        <figcaption>Rica died after five days of agony following a beating by evil Baker</figcaption>

      <p>The court heard how the abuse was a "normal" part of Rica's life.</p>
      <p>Assistant State's Attorney Erika Reynolds said: "For most, it’s unthinkable but for Rica, it was normal.</p>
      <p>"In (Baker's home), Rica was treated as less than as this defendant’s punching bag and her pain served as entertainment for the entire family,”</p>
      <p>"Rica's life didn't matter to this defendant, but it matters in this courtroom."</p>
      <p>Baker was also convicted of aggravated battery, three counts of domestic battery and endangering the life of a child.</p>
      <p>Judge Casey Costigan stated that her crimes were "accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty."</p>
