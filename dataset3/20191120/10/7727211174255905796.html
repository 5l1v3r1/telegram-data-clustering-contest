      <h2>Daniel Fleming, from Wallasey, was described as having 'a heart of gold' by devastated friends</h2>

      <p>More tributes have been paid to a tragic teenager who fell to his death off a bridge - as a petition got underway to fence off dangerous spots on the roads.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/brothers-moving-tribute-one-kind-17278470">Much-loved Daniel Fleming,</a> 19, suffered fatal injuries at the scene on Oakdale Road in Wallasey, just after 7am on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/floral-tributes-line-bridge-after-17280334">His devastated family</a> described him as "one of a kind" following his death.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teenager-dies-after-bridge-fall-17273543">an online petition has been launched,</a> calling for "fencing on all bridges and railway tracks."</p>
      <p>Llanah Owens, who started the campaign, wrote: "Too many men and women are taking their own lives and there's not even half as much support out there as there could be.</p>
      <p>"Personally, I think that if it was harder to get over, and they had more time to think they may realise there's another way.</p>

      <p>She said: "The world is a cruel cruel place and I am completely devastated and heartbroken you felt like this.</p>
      <p>"I wish you knew how much you were loved.</p>
      <p>"You were the most selfless and beautiful person, inside and out, and always made sure you were there for me.</p>
      <p>"You really did have a heart of gold.</p>
