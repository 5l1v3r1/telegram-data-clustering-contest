      <p>Both superstars have taken part in three World Cups, with Ronaldo's best result being a fourth-place finish in 2006, while Messi's Argentina ended up as runners-up in 2014.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, though, has won two international pieces of silverware with his national team, namely the 2016 UEFA European Championship and the 2019 UEFA Nations League titles.</p>
      <p>His Juventus teammate Danilo has now revealed that Ronaldo once claimed he would have helped Brazil to five more World Cup titles if he had represented the Selecao instead of Portugal.</p>

      <p>"Cristiano Ronaldo once told me that if he had played with the Brazilian national team, we would have five more World Cups," Danilo told <i>DAZN Brazil</i>.</p>
      <p>"It was nice to link up him again at Juventus. He dedicates himself to football in an almost manic way, (as) he takes care of every detail to the fullest.</p>
      <p>"This shows that successes don't come by chance, but you have to work to achieve them."</p>
