      <p>RAWALPINDI (Dunya News) – Sons and daughter-in-laws of former Prime Minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) senior leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Wednesday have appeared before the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Rawalpindi.</p>
      <p>According to details, Abdullah Shahid Khaqan and Haider Shahid Khaqan along with their wives reached NAB office to record testimonies in liquefied natural gas (LNG) case.</p>
      <p>Earlier,accountability court had extended judicial remand of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and ex-finance minister Miftah Ismail till December 3 in the same case.</p>
      <p>It is to be mentioned here that the apex court on September 10, 2018 directed the NAB to complete the inquiry against Abbasi and others for the alleged corruption in the LNG contract.</p>
      <p>As the minister for petroleum and natural resources, he has been accused of granting contract on LNG Terminal to ETPL, Tri-partial agreement, LSA with EETPL and LNG import from Qatar etc.</p>
      <p>In June 2018, the NAB approved inquiry against former premier Nawaz Sharif and Abbasi, who was the former minister for petroleum and natural resources at that time, in granting contract of LNG terminal for 15 years to their ‘favourite’ company.</p>
      <p>It was also observed that this contract had allegedly caused a loss of billions of rupees to the national exchequer.</p>
      <p>In January, the NAB interrogated former finance minister Miftah Ismail in the same case.</p>
      <p>According to NAB documents, the contract for the LNG import and distribution was awarded to the Elengy Terminal, a subsidiary of Engro, in 2013 in violation of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and relevant laws.</p>
