      <h1>Cross-dressing lover guilty of fiancee’s brutal bashing murder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:02:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/henry-vaughan/" target="_blank">Henry Vaughan</a></address>
      <p>A man who battered his Australian fiancee to death when she wanted to leave him because of his cross-dressing has been found guilty of murder in Britain.</p>
      <p>Roderick Deakin-White, 38, repeatedly <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2019/10/31/amy-parsons-roderick-deakin-white/">hit Amy Parsons, 35, over the head with a metal bar while she was showering</a> in the flat they shared in Whitechapel, east London.</p>
      <p>She suffered “horrific injuries” to her head, face and brain during the attack on April 25 before he left her bleeding to death on the floor.</p>
      <p>Deakin-White denied murder but was found guilty by a jury on Tuesday. He faces a life sentence when he is sentenced on November 26.</p>
      <p>The court heard Ms Parsons, who was from Melbourne but worked as a  personal assistant for a city of London company, became increasingly dissatisfied with the relationship, telling friends one bone of contention was Deakin-White’s cross-dressing.</p>
      <p>“She was unhappy about this and this was something he had often wanted to do when they were intimate,” prosecutor Gareth Patterson QC said.</p>
      <p>He told jurors Deakin-White became angry and jealous after Ms Parsons began a relationship with her colleague, James Saunders, a few weeks before the killing.</p>
      <p>Mr Patterson said Deakin-White launched the attack after Ms Parsons told him she was leaving him.</p>
      <p>“Unwilling to accept that she was going to leave him, he used a metal bar to hit her repeatedly around the head while she was showering in the Docklands flat which they shared,” he said.</p>
      <p>“By his blows with the bar he caused her horrific injuries and fractures to the head and face and brain.”</p>
      <p>Ms Parsons was left bleeding on the shower floor. Deakin-White fled the flat before confessing to a friend, who persuaded him to hand himself in.</p>
      <p>Emergency services broke into the couple’s flat and found her naked body covered in blood slumped on the shower floor.</p>
      <p>An autopsy found she suffered major fractures to her head and face and died of a traumatic brain injury.</p>
      <p>In interviews with police, Deakin-White admitted attacking her with a metal bar but denied murder, claiming it was an “accident”.</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Darren Jones said: “Amy Parsons paid the ultimate price because of Deakin-White’s controlling, selfish and violent nature.</p>
      <p>“He relied on Amy’s financial support and I believe he could not stand the fact that she was moving on and refused to be taken advantage of any more.</p>
      <p>“Amy had become aware of what kind of person he was and was beginning to take steps to leave Deakin-White.</p>
      <p>“These steps included a new relationship, free from Deakin-White’s coercive and abusive behaviour.</p>
      <p>“Because of this Deakin-White launched a vicious and brutal attack on Amy, without warning and in her own home, where she should have been safe and secure.”</p>
