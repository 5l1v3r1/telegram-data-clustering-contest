      <p>Robert Pattinson recently sent fans into meltdown <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/17/robert-pattinson-cast-next-batman-internet-freaking-9580770/">after he was cast as Batman</a>, before tipping Jennifer Lopez for his own role.</p>
      <p>Basically <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/robert-pattinson-is-trolling-us-all-with-his-ridiculous-interviews-11028079/">another example of him trolling</a> us all.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old ignored all the chaos – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/robert-pattinson-cant-stop-masturbating-movies-teases-ferocious-scene-lighthouse-10938019/">and took a break from all that masturbating</a> – as he attempted to go unnoticed in New York, popping out for a photoshoot.</p>
      <p>He was spotted keeping his head down as he made his way around Manhattan in a light brown overcoat, paired with a blue hoodie and beige trousers.</p>
      <p>Clutching a garment bag, he completed the casual, off-duty look with a pair of black boots and a hat.</p>
      <p>Robert’s appearance comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/robert-pattinson-already-giving-away-batman-role-even-started-11136733/">he seemed to give away his Batman role to JLo</a> – before the film has even hit the big screen.</p>

      <p>While we’d all love to see Jenny From The Block causing chaos in the Batmobile, the Twilight actor was the one Matt Reeves suggested for his ‘new vision’ of the Caped Crusader.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>And, during a chat between the pair for Variety’s Actors On Actors series, Jen explained she was totally on board with the casting.</p>
      <p>‘I think you’d be a great Batman,’ she told him. ‘An awesome Batman.’</p>
      <p>Enjoying the compliments, he replied: ‘You would be as well.’</p>
      <p>But Rob’s suggestion appeared to light a fire in the 50-year-old, who took his words and ran with them.</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘I could be Batman. Why not?</p>
      <p>‘I think as an actor, it would be fun to explore.’</p>
      <p>Someone get Matt back on the phone…</p>
      <p>Fans will be blessed with Robert’s version of Batman on 25 June, 2021, so we still have well over a year and a half to get excited for the film.</p>
      <p>It was recently announced that the Twilight star would be joined in the cast by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/zoe-kravitz-cast-play-catwoman-alongside-robert-pattinson-batman-10918956">Andy Serkis – as Alfred – and new Catwoman Zoe Kravitz</a>.</p>
      <p>We’re sure they could find room for JLo somewhere…</p>
