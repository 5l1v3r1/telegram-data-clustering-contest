      <h2>The 30-year-old made an interesting candidate for the EFL’s QFQ feature in which he identified Birmingham City's biggest joker and gave one typically modest response</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:52:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:52</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Lukas Jutkiewicz has been a professional footballer for 13 years, there isn’t much the Birmingham City talisman hasn’t seen or done in a career that has spanned 400 league matches.</p>
      <p>So the 30-year-old made an interesting candidate for the EFL’s QFQ feature, where stars are asked a series of quickfire questions.</p>
      <p>There’s the standard ones like tea or coffee, night in or night out, Messi or Ronaldo and sweets or chocolate</p>
      <p>And there are more revealing questions such as the best pre-match superstition he has witnessed, or his biggest inspiration in football.</p>

      <p>For the record it’s this 90s great: “I grew up in Southampton so you can’t really look any further than Matt Le Tissier,” Jutkiewicz revealed.</p>
      <p>“I went down to The Dell to watch him and he was just different from everyone else, he could win a game on his own.”</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> fans will be more interested in the joker in the Blues pack:</p>
      <p>“I think what would have to be David Davis, he’s always pulling pranks everywhere.</p>
      <p>“He’s nicking pieces of clothing, usually mine, it then ends up on a hanger or a mannequin out on the training pitch.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to have those guys in the changing room, it keeps spirits high and keep it light.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And his response to the most skilful player he has played with, is typically self-effacing.</p>
      <p>“To be honest everyone I’ve played with seems to be more skilful than me so it’s a little bit of a tough one that. Scotty Arfield is pretty skilful at Burnley.”</p>

        <figcaption>Jonathan Kodjia is challenged by Ryan Shotton</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Blues supporters will recall his candidate for best haircut.</p>
      <p>“It’s got to be Ryan Shotton before the Blues-Villa derby, he dyed his hair blue so that was pretty good commitment to the cause I thought.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>That was in October 2016, the first league meeting between the rivals for six years, in which Davis cancelled out Gary Gardner’s opener for the visitors.</p>
      <p>The game ended 1-1 and Shotton’s blue rinse clearly lived long in some memories.</p>
      <p>Finally, asked the best thing about football, Jutkiewicz replied:</p>
      <p>“For me personally I get to do what I love doing as my job every day and I think football is very inclusive, anyone can go and play football, no matter where you’re from, no matter what your upbringing is like, I would like to think that football is for everybody.”</p>
