      <p>Borrisoleigh Historical Society will host a talk on the life of Bishop Thomas Quinlan on Friday, November 29 in the Community Centre Borrisoleigh at 8pm.</p>
      <p>Thomas Quinlan was born in Pallas, Borrisoleigh and as a young man he joined the Columban Order of missionary priests.</p>
      <p>Posted first to China, in 1934 he joined the Order’s mission in Korea. His time in Korea coincided with a most troublesome period in the history of that country, surviving Japanese occupation, house arrest, the Second World War and the Korean War with its infamous death march.</p>
      <p>Upperchurch man, Eugene Shortt has extensively studied on the life of Thomas Quinlan and has compiled a detailed lecture on the life of the Pallas missionary.</p>
      <p>This talk gives a fuller and rounder picture of the man who, although chiefly associated with that Death March, was involved in and led, many more initiatives and accomplishments on the Korean peninsula.</p>
      <p>Talk begins at 8pm, admission is €5. All welcome.</p>
