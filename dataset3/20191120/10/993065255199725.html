      <p>George Alagiah has said he did not want to know his chances of surviving cancer.</p>
      <p>The BBC News presenter chose to remain ignorant of the mortality statistics for bowel cancer following his diagnosis.</p>
      <p>He said he examined his life for six months after receiving the news, and decided he was happy despite his illness.</p>
      <p>Alagiah announced that he was undergoing treatment for bowel cancer in 2014 and after an absence from BBC News, returned to screens in 2015.</p>
      <blockquote>I realised that the good things far outweighed the bad<cite>George Alagiah</cite></blockquote>
      <p>However, in 2018 he announced that he would need further treatment for the illness.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the Bowel Cancer UK podcast, Alagiah said he never wanted to know his chances.</p>
      <p>He said: “I decided I didn’t want to know about the survival statistics. It’s a very unpredictable disease, you’re good one week and not the next, good chances one year and not the next.”</p>
      <p>The journalist had to weigh the positives and negatives of his life to make peace after receiving the bad news.</p>
      <p>He said: “It took me about three to six months after my diagnosis, I called it getting to a place of contentment. I needed that.</p>
      <p>“Just to kind of look at my life and say whatever happens, do you know what, I’m content’.</p>
      <p>“I literally had a list of good things that happened to me and bad things, and I realised that the good things far outweighed the bad.</p>
      <p>“Is there somebody out there in some other country could do something for me that doctors here can’t?”</p>
      <p>The full discussion with Alagiah can be heard on the Bowel Cancer UK podcast.</p>
