        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a>’s anger and frustration at criticism will lead him to be a success as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> manager, believes Graeme Souness.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho’s appointment as Spurs boss on Wednesday morning was met with mixed reactions from Tottenham fans and the wider football world.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has been out of management since leaving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> in December last year and came under fire for his spell at Old Trafford, despite winning the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a>, EFL Cup and finishing second in the Premier League during his two-and-a-half years in charge.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese was sacked with United sixth in the table, having been criticised for a negative style of play and getting little return from nearly £400m spent on 11 players.</p>
      <p>However, since winning the Portuguese title and UEFA Cup with Porto in 2003, Mourinho has gone on to win trophies with Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Manchester United.</p>

      <p>It is this consistent success, along with the drive to prove his critics wrong, that will make him a hit at Spurs, believes Souness.</p>
      <p>‘He is a guy that has won trophies wherever he has been. I would expect him to do the same at Spurs,’ said the former Liverpool manager.</p>
      <p>‘Spurs have won three trophies in 28 years. For a big club that’s just not good enough.</p>

      <p>‘Spurs are genuinely a big football club and they need someone that can turn what is perceived to be attacking, attractive football into maybe a slightly more pragmatic approach that will put some silverware in the boardroom, and I think he is the perfect fit for them.</p>
      <p>‘He is an angry man, deep inside. He’s a frustrated man, the way it turned out at United. I think Spurs will reap the benefit of that.</p>
      <p>‘He knew he was going to go back and he was just waiting for the right one. He loves the English game.</p>
      <p>‘I think Spurs are getting the right man at the right time. He feels he has a point to prove to people who doubted him or were critical of him. He will want to ram those words down his critics’ throats.’</p>
      <p>Tottenham’s three trophies in 28 years are the 1991 FA Cup and League Cup wins in 1999 and 2008.</p>
      <p>They have not won a league title since 1961 or a European competition since the UEFA Cup triumph in 1984.</p>
