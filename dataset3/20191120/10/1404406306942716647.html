      <p>Seven employees from a Milwaukee Popeyes have been fired after a customer captured a huge brawl between the workers. This comes after a string of <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259004/two-couples-caught-on-camera-brawling-outside-of-popeyes">violent incidents</a> at Popeyes across the country in recent months, including one <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/258943/update-suspect-identified-in-fatal-popeyes-stabbing">fatal stabbing</a>. </p>
      <p>Customer Richard Fourté spoke to local Fox 6 Now, revealing what he saw leading up to the incident. He explained, "I heard one of them yell, 'It's a fight.' They ran to the back by the grills, OK. Now, there was a fight back there. I didn't get that one on tape." Fourté then pulled out his camera and recorded the second fight, which shows male and female employees slapping, pushing, and punching one another, while another employee jumps over the counter to join in on the violent incident.</p>
      <p>Police responded to the scene, but no arrests were made. It's still unclear what started the fight.  </p>
