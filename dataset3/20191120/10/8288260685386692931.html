      <p>The devastated family of a woman found dead - sparking a murder probe - have told of their devastation at the loss of their 'bright, funny and intelligent girl'.</p>
      <p>Sarah Hopkins, 25, was found unresponsive in Causeway Lane, Upton on Severn, in Worcestershire, at around 8am on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>Her death is being investigated by West Mercia Police and a 44-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder was later released on bail until next month.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a statement issued by West Mercia Police, Sarah's family said she was starting a "fresh, positive chapter" in her life with a new relationship.</p>
      <p>They said: “We are absolutely devastated to announce that Sarah was taken from us at just 25-years-old.</p>

      <p>"Sarah was a popular, well known and well liked member of Upton-upon-Severn's community and she will be so sorely missed.</p>
      <p>"Sarah was a bright, funny and intelligent girl with a beautifully sarcastic sense of humour. Sarah loved being bold and colourful and expressed it through her clothes and body art.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"She was passionate about animals and loved and absolutely adored her ‘doggos’!</p>
      <p>"It is tragic to know that Sarah was at the beginning a fresh positive chapter in her life having recently started a wonderful new relationship. We are heartbroken and will miss Sarah always.”</p>
      <p>Police said her family and friends have asked that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.</p>
      <p>It was previously revealed she had been a former worker at the Plough Inn Pub in the small Worcestershire town.</p>
