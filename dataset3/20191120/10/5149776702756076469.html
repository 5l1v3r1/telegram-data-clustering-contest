      <h1>Police tease shoplifter over his changed appearance after he put on glasses</h1>
      <h2>It was 'not quite cunning enough' they said</h2>

      <p>Police have gently mocked a shoplifter who changed his appearance by putting on glasses - saying he had been 'not quite cunning enough'.</p>
      <p>David Springthorpe, 30, from Alfreton, was being sought by officers for breaching a court order as well as number of shoplifting offences.</p>
      <p>But cops didn't need to look far to find the thief after spotting him in the street - despite an attempt to 'change his image' by sporting a pair of glasses. <br/><br/>Mug shots show Springthorpe after he was arrested on Market Street, in South Normanton, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>.</p>
      <p>He was subsequently charged with the theft of several perfume and gift sets from Boots, and was jailed for 30 weeks at Chesterfield Justice Centre on Saturday (November 16).</p>

      <p>South Normanton and Pinxton Safer Neighbourhood Team, part of Derbyshire Police, shared details on social media yesterday, Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "David Springthorpe was recently detained by PCSO Tom Smedley after a short foot chase in South Normanton. Springthorpe was wanted on Prison Recall as well as for a number of shoplifting offences.</p>
      <p>"Springthorpe has recently changed his image by sporting a pair of glasses.... fortunately, this was not quite cunning enough to outsmart the team.</p>
      <p>"He was convicted of the thefts and sentenced to a 30 week custodial sentence."</p>

      <p>Springthorpe was previously in court in January for stealing steak worth £20 from a Co-Op store.</p>
      <p>A judge fined him £80 and ordered him to pay £20 compensation, a £30 victim surcharge and £85 costs after the court heard he was a heroin and crack cocaine user.</p>
