      <p>Elon Musk is forging ahead with a plan to make fast internet available to everyone via a network of interconnected satellites.</p>
      <p>But he might be doing it at the expense of the night sky.</p>
      <p>SpaceX, the private company that Musk founded, is in the middle of pursuing the ‘Starlink’ project. In its entirety, the project will consist of 12,000 mass-produced satellites all orbiting the Earth and beaming internet signal down to us.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/elon-musks-spacex-launches-fleet-60-starlink-satellites-orbit-around-earth-11084813/">sent 60 satellites into space earlier this month</a> to join 60 that were previously launched in the summer.</p>
      <p>But Earth-based astronomers have already come out to criticise the endevour as the satellites have begun to interfere with observations of the night sky.</p>

      <p>‘A full constellation of Starlink satellites will likely mean the end of Earth-based microwave-radio telescopes able to scan the heavens for faint radio objects,’ said Alan Duffy, an astronomer at Swinburne University in Melbourne and the lead scientist of the Royal Institution of Australia.</p>
      <p>‘The enormous benefits of global internet coverage will outweigh the cost to astronomers, but the loss of the radio sky is a cost to humanity as we lose our collective birthright to see the afterglow of the Big Bang or the glow of forming stars from Earth,’ he told <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/elon-musk-s-starlink-satellite-train-looks-amazing-but-astronomers-have-real-concerns">ScienceAlert</a> back in May.</p>
      <p>Duffy’s argument is a reasoned one – it’s unlikely that astronomers will be able to stand in the way of the economic, political and philanthropic drive to put more satellites in space. But for the passionate view that value the night sky, Musk has become a ‘polluter of the heavens’.</p>

      <p>Last month, Musk used an orbiting Starlink satellite to send a tweet which said: ‘Whoa, it worked!!’</p>

      <p>Each satellite has an autonomous system for dodging space junk. In September, however, the European Space Agency had to move one of its satellites out of the way of a Starlink satellite. SpaceX later said it corrected the problem.</p>

      <p>SpaceX is among several companies interested in providing broadband internet coverage worldwide, especially in areas where it costs too much or is unreliable. Others include OneWeb and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon.</p>
      <p>According to Musk, Starlink revenue can help SpaceX develop rockets and spacecraft for travelling to Mars, which is his overriding ambition.</p>
