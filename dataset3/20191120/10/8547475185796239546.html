        <b>The Conservative Party has faced criticism and calls for an investigation after one of its official Twitter accounts was rebranded as a fact-checking service during the ITV leaders' debate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Conservative Campaign Headquarters press office account was renamed "factcheckUK" during Tuesday evening's ITV broadcast, offering commentary on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's statements and retweeting messages supporting Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The move was criticised by independent fact-checking charity Full Fact, which tweeted: "It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate. Please do not mistake it for an independent fact-checking service such as @FullFact, @FactCheck or @FactCheckNI"</p>
      <p>The chief executive of the fact-checking charity, Will Moy, has said Twitter "could have acted sooner" after the Conservative Party renamed their account FactCheckUK during last night's leaders' debate.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the BBC, Mr Moy said: "It was an attempt to mislead voters and I think it is inappropriate and misleading for a serious political party to behave that way.</p>
      <p>"And it's surprising as well. Why would a self-respecting political party choose to impersonate something else to put its campaign messages out there?"</p>
      <p>Labour candidate David Lammy wrote online: "The Conservative Party press office rebranding themselves as "FactCheckUK" shows what disdain this party and this government has for the truth.</p>
      <p>"The Electoral Commission must investigate and punish this blatant attempt to deceive the public."</p>
      <p>The @CCHQpress account is verified by Twitter, displaying a blue tick which is intended to denote that a user is genuine.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrat press office posted an image suggesting they were reporting the account to Twitter for "pretending to be me or someone else".</p>
      <p>They tweeted: "And people wonder why trust in politics has been eroded @CCHQPress"</p>
      <p>Labour's David Lammy tweeted: "The Conservative Party press office @CCHQPress rebranding themselves as 'FactCheckUK' shows what disdain this party and this government has for the truth."</p>
      <p>"The Electoral Commission must investigate and punish this blatant attempt to decieve the public."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some other Twitter users also changed their display names to factcheckUK and posted critical comments about Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>Others changed their display name CCHQ Press Office, while Tony Blair's former spokesperson Alastair Campbell changed his display name to Boris Johnson and tweeted: "I won't get Brexit done #FactCheck"</p>
      <p>The Twitter display name was changed back to CCHQ Press shortly after the debate ended. The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment.</p>
