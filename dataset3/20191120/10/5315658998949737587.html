      <h1>Charles' Waitangi visit highlights Kāwanatanga as partner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:04:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Republic" target="_blank">New Zealand Republic</a></address>
      <p>"Prince Charles’ visit to Waitangi today, the first by a Royal in a quarter-century, highlights Moana Jackson’s view that it is kāwanatanga that is the Treaty partner," said Lewis Holden, campaign chair of New Zealand Republic.</p>
      <p>In 1994, Moana Jackson observed "Precedent is established that the effective party to the Treaty is actually kāwanatanga or government. So whether that government takes the form of a constitutional monarchy or a republic is irrelevant. They are still bound by the terms of the agreement signed in 1840."</p>
      <p>“New Zealand Republic has a clear position on the Treaty: any republic legislation must include a Treaty clause, making it clear that nothing about the transition to a New Zealand head of state will affect the Treaty" concluded Mr Holden.</p>
