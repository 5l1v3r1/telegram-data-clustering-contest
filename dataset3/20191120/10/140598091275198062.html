      <p>If you get your butcher to bone and dice the rabbit for you, this recipe is actually very straightforward. It makes a lovely Italian dinner for four. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 10 minutes |<b> Cooking time: </b>45 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 whole rabbit, boned and diced by your butcher into small pieces (you want about 700g of diced meat), or see below</li>
        <li>125ml olive oil, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>15 cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>175ml white wine</li>
        <li>2 tbsp picked marjoram leaves</li>
        <li>1 good pinch of chopped thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 good pinch of chopped basil leaves</li>
        <li>300g fresh or dried pappardelle or tagliatelle</li>
        <li>2 tbsp freshly grated parmesan, plus extra to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>If you are a confident butcher, break the whole rabbit down into pieces and remove all the meat from the bones.</li>
        <li>Dice the meat into small pieces and set aside separately from the liver, heart and kidneys. Dice these up as well.</li>
        <li>Keep the bones for another time (I tend to freeze them and use them for stocks).</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat then add the diced rabbit meat and cook gently for about two minutes, turning the meat over with a wooden spoon and seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Next add the garlic and cherry tomatoes and cook for five minutes to allow the tomatoes to break down – this will thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the diced liver, heart and kidney and simmer for a further minute or two.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the wine along with 100ml of water and all the herbs, and cook for about 30 minutes until you have a thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Check the seasoning and keep warm if using immediately, or allow to cool if making ahead. It can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan of boiling water and cook the pasta as per the packet instructions, until just cooked (about two minutes if using fresh). Drain the pasta well and toss with the hot sauce, adding the Parmesan (I saw this trick in Italy and it works a treat).</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, with extra parmesan and a drizzle olive oil if you desire.</li>
      </ol>
