      <p>YUKON — Holiday festivities will begin Saturday in Yukon with the grand opening of the holiday wonderland "Christmas in the Park," the Kringle Karnival, the annual Chill Your Cheeks 5K Run and the Jingle Walk.</p>
      <p>Christmas in the Park is in its 24th season. Motorists can drive along miles of illuminated paths of colorful lights, movement and music. Over 500 lighted displays and over 4.5 million Christmas lights twinkle across 100 acres of three interconnecting city parks. Guests also can enjoy walking through the tunnels of lights leading from Chisholm Trail Park to Freedom Trail.</p>
      <p>Christmas in the Park will be open from 6 to 11 p.m. nightly beginning Saturday and continue through New Year’s Eve. The tour includes Yukon City Park, Freedom Trail and Chisholm Trail Park.</p>
      <p>Headlining the 24th year is a new three-story-tall animated Christmas tree that will combine colorful lights with animation and messages synced to favorite Christmas tunes.</p>
      <p>Several “selfie stations” also will be scattered throughout the parks and will be festive backdrops for family photos or profile pictures. Visitors are asked to tag the city of Yukon in their social media pictures: @cityofyukonokgov on Facebook and @cityofyukonok on Twitter.</p>
      <p>For those who enjoy viewing the lights on foot, miles of walking trails wind through Chisholm Trail Park. Walkers, as well as those who want to visit Santa, are encouraged to park in the Oklahoma Parking Lot on the north end of Chisholm Trail Park.</p>
      <p>Admission is free, although donations will be accepted at both the Chisholm Trail Park exit and the City Park exit. The donations collected help fund Christmas in the Park.</p>
      <p>The <b>Mascot Dash</b> will start at 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Mascots from all over the area will compete in a 100-yard dash.</p>
      <p>Then, the <b>Chill Your Cheeks 5K Run</b> will begin at 5 p.m. at Chisholm Trail Park.</p>
      <p>Runners will follow a course that takes them along area streets and ultimately through the Christmas in the Park lights. Registration is available at www.yukonok.gov/catalog or through Tyler Kilmer at 405-350-8920 or tkilmer@yukonok.gov.</p>
      <p>The <b>Jingle Walk</b> will begin at 5:30 p.m. at the Boot Trail in Chisholm Trail Park. This fun-walk will travel through Chisholm Trail Park’s millions of glowing Christmas lights. On-site registration will begin at 5:30 p.m., and the event is free. All participants in the Jingle Walk will receive a jingle bell bracelet. For details, contact Dennis Warren at dwarren@yukonok.gov or 350-8920.</p>
