      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>The meeting between Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) office-bearers and the high-power committee constituted by the HRD Ministry to restore normalcy on the campus is currently underway, sources said.</p>
      <p>The meeting commenced around 10:30 AM and the students' union office-bearers are attending it along with the student councillors from different schools, they said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The JNU students have been protesting for over three weeks against a draft hostel manual, which has provisions for hostel fee hike, dress code and curfew timings.</p>
      <p>The varsity's Executive Council (EC) had later announced a partial roll back in the fee but the students had dubbed it as an "eyewash".</p>
      <p>The EC had also removed provisions for curfew timings and dress code.</p>
      <p>The committee will be meeting hostel presidents of the varsity in the latter half of the day.</p>
      <p>The HRD Ministry had on Monday constituted the three-member committee to recommend ways to restore normal functioning of the JNU.</p>
      <p>The panel includes former UGC chairman V S Chauhan, AICTE chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe and UGC secretary Rajnish Jain.</p>
