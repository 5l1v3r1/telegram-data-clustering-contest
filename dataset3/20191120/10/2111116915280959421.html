      <p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/argos-black-friday-deals-16-11">Argos Black Friday</a> sale is only a few days away, but are some fantastic deals available already, with 20% off all Star Wars, Frozen and Marvel Avengers toys.</p>
      <p>With Frozen 2 due to arrive in cinemas on November 22, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker on 19 December, these are sure to be some of the hottest toys sitting under trees this Christmas.</p>
      <p>To claim the deal, just add your chosen toys to your shopping trolley and enter the code <b>STAR20 </b>at the checkout. The offer excludes gaming and accessories, but can be applied to hundreds of other products.</p>

      <p>There's scope for some huge savings here. For example, it brings the Disney Frozen 2 Sven Figure (which is big enough for your kids to ride) down from £120 to £96. It can also be applied on top of existing discounts, so the <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8674483">Marvel Titan Hero Series Mega Collection 11-pack</a>, which is already discounted from £80 to £60, is reduced to just £48 – a total saving of £32.</p>
      <p>This deal ends at midnight on November 26, so get your skates on!</p>
