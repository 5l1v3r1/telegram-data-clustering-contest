      <p><i>Public Actions Committee directs Bangalore Turf Club to stop all activities from December 2</i> <br/><br/>The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Karnataka Legislature has asked the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) to suspend all its activities from December 2. <br/><br/>The committee has accused the BTC of illegally occupying government land even after its lease ended in 2009. At a media interaction after the PAC meeting, committee chairman HK Patil said that the decision to stop all racing activities at the club was a unanimous one. <br/><br/>He added that the committee has directed Additional Chief Secretary (PWD) Rajaneesh Goel to take measures to collect pending dues from the BTC before December 1 and suspend all its activities from December 2. <br/><br/>Also, officials will have to take adequate measures to clear all legal hurdles pending before the Supreme Court within a month. <br/><br/>Goel, who was also present in the meeting, was asked to submit a detailed action taken report on the issue. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vinod Sivappa, chairman of BTC, said, “There is no official communication to us on the PAC decision. We have paid all dues to the government. <br/><br/>“On Wednesday, we will meet ISN Prasad, Additional Chief secretary (Finance) and a government-appointed nominee to get clarity.” <br/><br/>The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report placed before the Assembly had recommended the government to vacate the BTC from the present premises and had pointed that only a paltry sum was paid as rent. <br/><br/>Even though the lease expired in 2009, the BTC was paying just Rs 25.94 lakh per annum. <br/><br/>Between 1989-98, the club was paying just Rs 5 lakh per annum. <br/><br/>According to Patil, the BTC has to pay 2% of its total revenue as rent. <br/><br/>As per this calculation, the club has to pay Rs 32.87 crore as rent for the period between 2010-11 and 2017-18, he pointed. <br/><br/>Blaming bureaucrats for inaction, Patil, a former law minister said that subsequent governments since 1968 had decided to reclaim the race club land. <br/>Even the High Court of Karnataka had given a ruling in favour of the State government. <br/><br/>The BTC, however, has challenged the HC’s decision in the Supreme Court.</p>

      <p>Vinod Sivappa, BTC Chairman<br/><br/><br/>“They are occupying the government land by pointing at the pending case before the Supreme Court,’’ Patil said. <br/><br/><br/><b><u>No Decision on BGC</u></b> <br/><br/>To a question, whether the PAC was considering to take back the land given to the Bangalore Golf Club, HK Patil, chairman of the committee, said that they didn’t discuss anything about it in Tuesday’s meeting. <br/><br/><br/>The previous government had accused the BGC of violating rules and had issued a notice to cancel the lease.</p>
