      <p>Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross discussed “competitive issues facing the U.S. aerospace market” with the CEO of Boeing at a time when Ross’ wife owned nearly $3 million worth of stock in the company, according to an analysis of <a href="https://www.americanoversight.org/document/commerce-communications-with-businesses-linked-to-wilbur-ross-investments">correspondence</a> obtained by the ethics watchdog organization American Oversight<i>.</i>“If I were in the Department of Justice public integrity division, this set of facts would be enough for me to want to open up a criminal investigation,” said Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House.</p>
      <p>In early 2017, Ross arrived in Washington with vast financial assets, like his boss Donald Trump. However the commerce secretary, unlike the president, is subject to the federal conflicts-of-interest statute, which prohibits officials from taking certain actions that will affect their own financial holdings.</p>
      <p>Ross promised to get rid of dozens of assets that could cause conflicts of interest, including the Boeing shares, within 90 days of his confirmation. He also pledged to recuse himself from narrow issues impacting those investments until he divested, unless he received a written waiver. The commerce department did not respond to a question about whether the commerce secretary had gotten such a waiver. On March 30, 2017, when Ross’ wife still owned Boeing stock, he had a meeting with Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of the aerospace giant.</p>
      <p><i>Forbes </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2018/10/25/wilbur-ross-scheduled-meetings-with-chevron-boeing-despite-conflicts-of-interest/#480509ef4d0e">previously reported</a> on the existence of that meeting, but until now the specific topic of discussion—“competitive issues facing the U.S. aerospace market”—had remained a mystery. “It wasn’t just a general or vague meeting,” said Virginia Canter, who served as White House associate counsel to Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, adding, “I would feel obligated to make the [inspector general] aware of it if I was an ethics official.”</p>
      <p>Kathleen Clark, who once worked as an ethics lawyer for the District of Columbia and now teaches at Washington University in St. Louis, expressed the same sentiment. “I would think that this is enough certainly for the inspector general to open an investigation.”</p>

      <p><i>Forbes </i>reached out to the inspector general at the commerce department to see if an investigation is currently underway. “We do not comment on matters under review,” her chief of staff responded in an email.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the commerce department, meanwhile, suggested Ross followed the law. “The secretary has not taken any action that has a direct and predictable effect on his holdings,” the spokesperson said. “He has sought guidance from career ethics officials and did so for this meeting with Boeing at the beginning of his tenure at the department.”</p>
      <p>On April 18, 2017, Boeing Vice President Ted Austell followed up with Ross’ former chief of staff, Wendy Teramoto. “I hope this note finds you well from the holiday break,” he wrote in an email. “It was nice to meet you during the session between Secretary Ross and our chairman, Dennis Muilenburg, to discuss competitive issues facing the U.S. aerospace market. I am writing today to make you aware of a related matter that will involve the department at the end of this week.”</p>
      <p>Austell explained how the Canadian government was supporting Bombardier, a Boeing competitor, and claimed that was jeopardizing American jobs. As a result, Austell informed Teramoto that Boeing was about to ask the department of commerce to launch an investigation. Austell then suggested that Ross may want to be personally involved. “Should your time permit, I would look forward to an opportunity to speak with you directly by telephone,” Austell wrote, “as it may be appropriate for the secretary to make contact with his counterpart just before our filing.”</p>
      <p>Teramoto responded that she would not be able to set something up immediately. “Unfortunately I am in Japan with the secretary,” she wrote. “I am CC’ing two of his senior advisors—Earl Comstock and Eric Branstad. Look forward to connecting.”</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether Ross followed through on the request to contact his counterpart. When asked whether he did, a spokesperson for the commerce department did not answer the question directly, instead responding, “The record shows that Boeing’s request was sent to the appropriate commerce department staff, not Secretary Ross.”</p>
      <p>It is true that Austell <i>sent </i>the email to Teramoto, but the message suggested that Ross take action. “If [Ross] did that, that would absolutely be a problem under the criminal conflict-of-interest statute,” said Clark.</p>

      <p>On April 27, 2017, Boeing officially filed its petition with the Department of Commerce. Four days later, Ross’ wife sold the Boeing shares.</p>
      <p>Two-and-a-half weeks after that, on May 18, 2017, the Department of Commerce announced that it was launching a probe into Canadian aircraft imports, citing Boeing’s request. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world,” Ross said in a statement at the time, “but we must take action if our rules are being broken.”</p>
