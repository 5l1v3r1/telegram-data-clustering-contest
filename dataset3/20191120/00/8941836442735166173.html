      <h1>Gerardo Parra, source of Nationals’ ‘Baby Shark’ fev</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gerardo-parra/">Gerardo Parra</a> is taking “Baby Shark” on an international tour.</p>
      <p>The Yomiuri Giants, a Nippon Professional Baseball team based in Tokyo, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/gerardo-parra-signs-japan-yomiuri-112744352.html">announced</a> that they signed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gerardo-parra/">Parra</a>, ending the Venezuelan outfielder’s brief but unforgettable stay with the Washington Nationals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gerardo-parra/">Parra</a>, 32, joined the Nationals in early May of 2019 after being waived by the San Francisco Giants. He was widely credited by his teammates and manager Dave Martinez for injecting a more fun and carefree attitude to the clubhouse culture while the Nationals were coping with a dismal 19-31 start.</p>
      <p>A few weeks after arriving in Washington, Parra wanted to change his walk-up music. He was swiping through his phone looking for a new song, and “Baby Shark” kept popping up, as his then-2-year-old daughter loved the song and often wanted her dad to play it for her.</p>
      <p>Eventually, he relented. The next time he walked up to the plate, “Baby Shark” played over the Nationals Park loudspeakers. For fans it became a craze, and many who attended games would perform the hand motions that accompany the song. So Parra kept it the rest of the year, all the way into the World Series.</p>

      <p>In truth, Parra was more important off the field than on it by season’s end. He was used during the playoffs as a pinch-hitter, but during the regular season the two-time National League Gold Glove winner was an important fill-in in the outfield and even at first base while Washington coped with a pile of injuries.</p>
      <p>Parra batted .250 with eight home runs and 42 RBIs for the Nationals in 89 appearances.</p>
