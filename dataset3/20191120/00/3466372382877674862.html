      <p>Imran Khan isn't the brightest being you've met, except when playing cricket.</p>
      <p>Yet, even by his standards, his offer to make the visit to Kartarpur Sahib visa free for only the Sikhs from India was curious.</p>
      <p>How would he, to begin with, define a Sikh?</p>
      <p>Sikhism is neither doctrinaire, nor exclusive.</p>
      <p>Anyone from any faith is welcome in a gurdwara.</p>
      <p>You just need to follow a couple of simple rules: A covered head, bare feet.</p>
      <p>Then, you can pray, the priest will treat you and get you the blessings from the holy book like any other devotee, and the <i>sangat</i> (community) will feed you at the <i>langar</i>.</p>
      <p>There is no place in Sikhism, including the Golden Temple or Akal Takht Sahib, where anyone's faith bars them.</p>
      <p>The essence of Sikhism is bar none.</p>
      <p>That is where the philosophy of the <i>langar</i>, a community meal where everyone eats together, comes from.</p>
      <p>You share a meal, you are equals.</p>
      <p>Then anyone, irrespective of faith, can do <i>kar sewa</i> (voluntary work).</p>
      <p>And so many do.</p>
      <p>This is the reason Sikh holy places are among the cleanest anywhere.</p>
      <p>There is much anxiety in India about the moves and intentions of Imran/the Pakistan army/the Inter-Services Intelligence over Kartarpur Sahib.</p>
      <p>They all might be -- and probably are -- as diabolical as we suspect.</p>
      <p>But they aren't particularly bright.</p>
      <p>Even if they had such a genius idea of subverting India's Sikhs and reviving separatism through Kartarpur Sahib, Imran has ruined their 'operation' by offering freebies to only the Sikhs.</p>
      <p>Besides the fact that the Sikh faith, intrinsically equal and inclusive, will dismiss this preferential treatment with contempt, Imran will also not know how to define a Sikh, or tell one from any other devotee of Guru Nanak and the great faith he and his nine successors founded.</p>
      <p>There is nothing in Sikh practice and tradition that discriminates Sikh from non-Sikh.</p>
      <p>Imran has bought into the old military establishment folklore in Pakistan that a final Sikh-Hindu division is inevitable.</p>
      <p>That two efforts in the past -- one in the mid-1960s and the second in the 1981-1994 period -- failed, but the time for a third push has now come.</p>
      <p>That's why some overseas Sikh organisations, especially in Canada, are being brought together with Pakistani immigrant groups, especially Kashmiri (Mirpuri), and this so-called 'Referendum 2020' is being sponsored.</p>
      <p>Another chapter is being opened in an old playbook.</p>
      <p>It is bound to fail like the earlier ones, again causing Pakistan enormously more damage than to India.</p>
      <p>We, in India, need have no anxieties.</p>
      <p>Breaking the Sikhs away from India is a fantasy of the Pakistani elites going back to the early 1950s, when that generation's wounds of Partition were still raw.</p>
      <p>The Pakistanis took this operation to its first peak in the mid-1960s, hoping to prise the Sikhs away.</p>
      <p>One faction of the Punjabi Suba (separate Punjabi state) movement had a radical/separatist impulse.</p>
      <p>But Partap Singh Kairon as chief minister in Punjab, and after his assassination Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi handled the challenge adroitly.</p>
      <p>Punjab was divided again, with Hindi-predominant Haryana and Himachal Pradesh becoming new states and a Punjabi-speaking (and Sikh) majority now with a Punjab of its own.</p>
      <p>A curious little sidelight: The Pakistanis also separated and tried to indoctrinate Sikh Indian prisoners of war, especially officers, in 1965.</p>
      <p>That chapter ended, and the second one was launched in 1981 by a Pakistani establishment emboldened by the new clout it had acquired with the Afghan jihad.</p>
      <p>It coincided, however, with many other factors internal to India: A revivalist mood among the Sikhs, weak governments, and the marginalisation of the Shiromani Akali Dal.</p>
      <p>Then, the arrival of a leader as charismatic and puritanical as Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.</p>
      <p>What followed is well recorded history.</p>
      <p>It is just that in the following 13 years, tens of thousands died.</p>
      <p>And then, just when it had begun to look like Punjab was a lost cause, it all ended.</p>
      <p>So rapidly that even those of us following this closely didn't have the time to catch our breath.</p>
      <p>And why did this happen? For sure, the security forces and intelligence agencies did their job well.</p>
      <p>But that phase of terror ended the day the Sikhs themselves decided that they had had enough.</p>
      <p>The real hero of that fight was the predominantly Sikh Punjab police.</p>
      <p>It was quite dramatic how Sikh popular opinion turned.</p>
      <p>From a point where some of my fellow journalists were even talking of visiting 'liberated zones' in Punjab, it ended almost overnight.</p>
      <p>In fact, no one even wanted to talk about this anymore.</p>
      <p>K P S Gill, who led the campaign as Punjab police chief then, spoke to me in detail for an <i>India Today</i> story, and when I asked him why and how this ended so dramatically, he said, you see, the Pakistanis do not read Iqbal: <i>Kuchch baat hai ke hasti, mit-ti nahin hamaari</i>...</p>
      <p>For the Pakistanis to think that they can bring back those days, therefore, is fantastic nonsense.</p>
      <p>Similarly, for us in India to now worry that the Pakistanis will take 'our' Sikhs away from 'us' is embarrassing neurosis.</p>
      <p>We have to be nuts to get unnerved over the pictures of Bhindranwale on the odd hoarding in Kartarpur Sahib.</p>
      <p>You can even find them in and around the Golden Temple, on key-chains sold in shops outside it, on the backs of cars in Delhi, and sometimes even as computer and tablet screen-savers.</p>
      <p>If we choose to get alarmed by any of this, we must have very little confidence in ourselves as a nation, and trust in the Sikh community.</p>
      <p>To think that they are so gullible as to fall for the same trope in 2019 is an insult to their intelligence.</p>
      <p>And to think any of us as 'we' who have to protect 'them' -- the Sikhs from evil Pakistanis -- is worse than being irrational.</p>
      <p>It's stupid.</p>
      <p>We had said that Indian social and national coherence had strengthened over the years as it had become more relaxed.</p>
      <p>We are stronger not because we are merely united in our diversity, but because we are at ease with it now.</p>
      <p>It is possible to argue today that the founders of our Republic were a bit anxious and erred in giving us the slogan of 'Unity in Diversity'.</p>
      <p>They should have simply said, celebrate diversity.</p>
      <p>Once you accept that, you need not worry about the national commitment to any fellow Indian.</p>
      <p>That's why it is time to forget subversive fears.</p>
      <p>India isn't made of porcelain.</p>
      <p>One of the holiest shrines for the Indian Sikhs and so many non-Sikh Indians is open now.</p>
      <p>It's a moment of collective joy for us to cherish.</p>
      <p>Switch off those TV discussions on the 'return of Khalistan'.</p>
      <p>It isn't happening.</p>
      <p>Don't paint the devil on the wall.</p>
      <p>And if it still bothers you, just remember that concluding line of the Sikh prayer, invoking Guru Nanak: <i>Nanak naam chardi kala/tere bhane sarbat da bhala</i>.</p>
      <p>Translated loosely: Nanak, your name would keep us all upbeat/on the ascendant/gung-ho (you can choose either or all, or find another name for that brilliant Sikh attitude)/may the entire mankind be joyful and prosperous with your benevolence.</p>
