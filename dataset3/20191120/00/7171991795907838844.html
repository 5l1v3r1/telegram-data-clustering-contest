      <h1>Starlink Satellites Posing Issues For Astronomers</h1>

      <p>Spotting satellites from the ground is a popular pastime among amateur astronomers. Typically, the ISS and Iridium satellites have been common sightings, with their orbits and design causing them to appear sufficiently bright in the sky. More recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/89Marvaz/status/1196356715270291456">SpaceX’s mass launches of Starlink satellites have been drawing attention for the wrong reasons</a>.</p>

      <p>Starlink is a project run by SpaceX to provide internet via satellite, using a variety of techniques to keep latency down and bandwidth high. There’s talk of inter-satellite laser communications, autonomous obstacle avoidance, and special designs to limit the amount of space junk created. <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/05/20/everything-we-know-about-spacexs-starlink-network/#more-358793">We’ve covered the technology in a comprehensive post earlier this year.</a></p>
      <p>The Starlink craft have long worried astronomers, who rely on a dark and unobstructed view of the sky to carry out their work. There are now large numbers of the satellites in relatively low orbits, and the craft have a high albedo, meaning they reflect a significant amount of the sunlight that hits them. With the craft also launching in a closely-packed train formation, <a href="https://twitter.com/lcjohnso/status/1196370554414125056/photo/1">there have already been impacts on research operations.</a></p>
      <p>There is some hope that as the craft move to higher orbits when they enter service, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2019/11/18/this-is-not-coolastronomers-despair-as-spacex-starlink-train-ruins-observation-of-nearby-galaxies/#3741f5c16538">this problem will be reduced</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1132908689860415488?lang=en">SpaceX are also reportedly considering modifications to the design to reduce albedo</a>, helping to keep the astronomy community onside. Regardless, with plans on the table to launch anywhere from 12,000 to 42,000 satellites, it’s likely this isn’t the last we’ll hear about the issue.</p>
