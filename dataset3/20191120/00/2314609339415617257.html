        <b>OPERA<br/>TURANDOT ★★★★<br/>Opera Australia, </b>
        <b>State Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne, until December 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the tenor in Puccini’s <i>Turandot</i> hits and holds the top B in <i>Nessun Dorma, </i>the applause will come – regardless of what’s happened in the preceding two acts. The audience will gratefully lap up the moment that, thanks to Pavarotti, has usurped the popularity of the entire work.</p>
      <p>While there’s no recreating Luciano, Opera Australia’s leading tenor Walter Fraccaro produces an effective performance in the company’s latest season of Puccini’s final opera. Besides, the score and the sopranos are the real reason to attend.</p>

      <p>A grandiose telling of a fantastical fairy tale, <i>Turandot</i> is the story of a beautiful but cruel princess in Imperial China. She beheads all would-be suitors who attempt to win her hand.</p>
      <blockquote>Blazing American soprano Lise Lindstrom is one of the best Turandots in the world and it shows</blockquote>
      <p>Sopranos who can sing the gruelling title role without breaking a sweat are in short supply. Blazing American soprano Lise Lindstrom is one of the best Turandots in the world and it shows, lazily filling the cavernous State Theatre with her steely, colossal soprano.</p>

      <p>It’s a voice that could have swallowed Fraccaro whole, despite his ardent efforts. He’s admirable but isn’t always easily heard, and his extreme use of <i>portamento</i> (sliding between notes) clouded his intonation.</p>
      <p>As Liu, Karah Son gets Puccini’s most sincere, impassioned music and she doesn’t waste it. In her poignant final scene, Son’s voice was full of heartbreak with huge, glorious high notes. The tenor might get the big tune but the sopranos soar in everything else.</p>
      <p>Graeme Murphy’s production is pushing 30 years old, but when you consider Franco Zeffirelli’s glittering 1987 version just played at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, vintage is nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
      <p>And when it’s one as visually stunning and impactful as Murphy’s, why not? In classic Murphy style, he uses unique shapes and fluid movement to keep your eye entertained at all times.</p>

      <p>Puccini conducted by Christian Badea is always a dramatic and moving affair.</p>
      <p>He crafts this music exceptionally well, with a vivacity that allows the intensity to build and blossom throughout the evening.</p>

      <p>Orchestra Victoria sounds spectacular under his hand, as do the Opera Australia Chorus.</p>
      <p>You already know and love three minutes of this opera, and Maestro Badea can make you fall for the other two-ish hours equally.</p>
