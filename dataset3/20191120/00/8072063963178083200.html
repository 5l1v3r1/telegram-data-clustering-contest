      <p><b>(SNO) –</b> Orsula Hypolite of Au Tabor, Anse La Raye, who lost everything in a fire on November 7, has received donations from the government as she struggles to get her life back on track.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Hypolite received a $10,000 check and hampers compliment the Government of St. Lucia and the Anse La Raye Village Council.</p>
      <p>Parliamentary Representative for Anse la Raye/Canaries, Dominic Fedee said on November 7, whilst representing Saint Lucia at the 2019 World Travel Market in London, he received a distressing video via WhatsApp which showed a house being gutted by fire in the community of Anse la Raye.</p>
      <p>“It was such a horrific shock for me that I fell out of the chair at the meeting because I couldn’t believe this had happened to someone I know so well and so close,” he said at a ceremony during which the items were presented to Hypolite.</p>
      <p>He said that the government stands with the Anse La Raye Village Council to build a bigger and better home for Hypolite.</p>
      <p>Fedee said the check was the first of many contributions that will be coming her way.</p>
      <p>Hypolite was filled with emotion when thanking those present for the donation.</p>
      <p>“Thank God, thank you Lord,” she said, her voice breaking. “And on behalf of my family and friends, I thank all of you</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Allen Chastanet, who attended the ceremony, assured Saint Lucian who may find themselves in similar situations, that the government is there to help.</p>
      <p>“I think that my government also recognizes that we have to be able to put a better system in place to be able to help people,” he remarked.</p>
