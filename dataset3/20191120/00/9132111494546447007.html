      <p>Beleaguered Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Samuel Ofosu Ampofo, says he would soon expose those seeking his downfall as he fights criminal charges in court.</p>
      <p>He said, he has learnt useful lessons from the ongoing trial, and will come out a stronger man.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofosu Ampofo is standing trial for conspiracy to assault a public officer and conspiracy to cause harm after he was secretly recorded allegedly outlining plans to cause mayhem.</p>
      <p>In the audio, Mr Ofosu Ampofo is allegedly heard inciting party communicators to assault public officials and plotting to harm some other civilians – allegations he has vehemently denied.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofosu Ampofo, who described his trial as a political witch-hunt, minced no words by stating that he knows those behind his misfortunes.</p>
      <p>The former Local Government Minister insisted that his arrest and subsequent trial is borne out of mischief and an attempt by his detractors to frustrate his effort as national chairman of the largest opposition party.</p>
      <p>He said these on Asempa FM on Wednesday while commenting on a wide range of issues on the station’s current affairs program, ‘’Ekosii sen”.</p>
      <p>“I know those who are pulling the strings, but let me tell them that I would remain resolute and continue to protect my party and the Ghanaian people,” the former legislator warned.</p>
      <p>When pressed by the host of the show to mention the names of his supposed detractors, he said “I’m not ready to disclose that now, but I will come out at the appropriate time”.</p>
      <p>Against this backdrop, he said the NDC would be extremely focus and strategic going into the 2020 general elections, as the party remains the most credible alternative for the citizenry.</p>
      <p>“We are going to pay attention to detail and adopt the most effective way of winning the 2020 elections.</p>
      <p>“The Ghanaian people have had the chance to experience the two parties and would make their choice next year, and I have no doubt that they will vote for the NDC,’’ he stressed.</p>
