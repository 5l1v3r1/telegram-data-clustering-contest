      <p>In NBA 2K20’s MyTeam mode, hardcore fans are conditioned to hunt Pink Diamond and Galaxy Opal cards. Those are the two highest gem levels in the mode. However, if you actually play the mode on a regular basis, and are perceptive, you know the gem levels only tell one part of the story. There are other factors and when you consider everything, the most dominant card currently in the game is the Diamond Giannis Antetokounmpo.</p>

      <p>You might be asking how this card, which is rated a 94 overall, could be better than cards like the Galaxy Opal Dominique Wilkins that you get from winning 1,000 Triple Threat games?</p>
      <p>It’s close, but it begins with the Diamond Antetokounmpo’s ratings, but that’s not where it ends. As you can see below, the card’s ratings are far from modest.</p>

      <p>The card only has four Hall-of-Fame badges, but when you consider this Giannis has a 90 speed, 90 driving dunk, 92 perimeter defense, 80 ball handling and 90 defensive rebound, it has a rather unique combination ratings.</p>
      <p>On both sides of the ball, he can be a force. As I mentioned, the ratings are just one part of it. Perhaps the biggest reason for the Diamond Giannis’ dominance lies in his passive strengths.</p>
      <p>Any Giannis card has some special gifts because of his unprecedented frame. The character’s length and speed are inherrent qualities that allow you to cover more ground on offense and defense. It’s difficult to quantify how big of a deal this is for a Giannis card. You have to own and play with it to grasp the value in the mode. I’ve actually controlled a game on both sides of the floor using Giannis as a rim protector and offense initiator.</p>
      <p>Oftentimes opponents have quit before the game is over, and other times Giannis simply bludgeons them and I still win.</p>
      <p>When you combine the ratings above with the length of the Giannis model, the Diamond card is the best. That is until a PD or GO version of the Milwaukee Bucks star is released.</p>
