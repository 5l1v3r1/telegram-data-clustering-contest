      <h1>Aliens: Isolation mod adds multiple xenomorphs to Creative Assembly’s horror game</h1>

      <p>Matt Filer has been working on an interesting mod for Alien: Isolation. Alien<b>s</b>: Isolation (pay attention to that extra “s”) is a mod that adds multiple xenomorphs to Creative Assembly’s horror game. And to be honest, it looks kind of cool.</p>
      <p>According to Matt, this mod is for those that found the game a bit too easy. And even though the mod is not out yet, Matt has released a video showcasing it in action.</p>
      <p>Now as you may have guessed, you can’t kill these xenomorphs. Similarly to the vanilla game, you’ll have to evade them and hide from them. Thus, the game will become way more difficult than what it initially was.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is no ETA on when this mod will come out. Still, and since there isn’t any new Alien game on the horizon, this is something that most Aliens fans will find interesting. Okay okay, <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/cold-iron-studios-is-working-on-an-aliens-mmo-for-current-gen-platforms/">Cold Iron Studios is still working on an Aliens MMO for current-gen platforms</a>. However, we haven’t heard anything about it since January 2019. Moreover, I’m almost certain that this MMO will not be coming to current-gen platforms. After all, next-gen consoles are right around the corner so it makes no sense to release an MMO for Xbox One and PS4.</p>
      <p>But anyway, enjoy the following video and stay tuned for more!</p>
