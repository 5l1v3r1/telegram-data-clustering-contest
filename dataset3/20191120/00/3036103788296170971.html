      <h1>TECNO Phantom 9 – A flagship smartphone without the big price tag</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>South Africa has many challengers in the mid-range smartphone market which are marketed as offering great value for money.</p>
      <p>However, one smartphone that stands out in this market is the TECNO Phantom 9 – which offers premium features at a fraction of a premium smartphone’s price tag.</p>
      <p>TECNO is the most popular cellphone company in Africa, and while they are best known for their feature phones, the company has brought several smartphones to the South African market – all of which offer fantastic value.</p>
      <p>TECNO provided us with a test unit of their recently launched Phantom 9 smartphone, and we were blown away by what it offered given its price tag.</p>
      <p>Consumers looking for a high-quality smartphone with the latest features, but who don’t want to spend an exorbitant price for such a smartphone, should seriously consider the Phantom 9.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>The first thing one notices when encountering the Phantom 9 is that it truly has a premium look.</p>
      <p>It sports a thin bezel, as well as an attractive glossy Lapland Aurora-coloured back cover, which exudes class.</p>
      <p>The device sits comfortably in the user’s hand, and users are also provided with a protective back cover to ensure that their device remains protected.</p>
      <p>The Phantom 9 sports a 6.4-inch 2,340×1,080 AMOLED display with a simple teardrop notch for the front-facing camera.</p>
      <p>This display offers fantastic image quality and would be perfect for any kind of video or image consumption.</p>
      <p>It also includes an in-display fingerprint sensor for optimal biometric security.</p>
      <h3>Camera</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the most impressive feature of the Phantom 9, however, is its camera.</p>
      <p>The Phantom 9 features a powerful triple-lens camera system, including a 16MP primary camera, an 8MP 120-degree ultra-wide-angle lens, and a tertiary 2MP lens for implementing bokeh effect.</p>
      <p>This camera system uses AI technology to improve image quality, including AI-driven automatic scene recognition and HDR.</p>
      <p>The Phantom 9’s camera system is capable of taking shots from as close as 2.5cm from the subject – ensuring that you can capture the finest details of the world around you.</p>
      <p>The front camera is equally impressive. It uses a 32MP lens, offers F2.0 aperture, and covers 75 different facial features.</p>
      <p>This enables the Phantom 9’s front camera to implement selfie stickers accurately, as it is able to optimise the positioning of these stickers to best align and interact with your face.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>The TECNO Phantom 9 sports premium-level specifications that compete favourably with some of the top premium smartphones on the market.</p>
      <p>The Phantom 9 sports 6GB RAM and 128GB memory, as well as a 2.35 GHz octa-core processor.</p>
      <p>It uses Google’s Android 9 Pie operating system and is powered by a 3,500mAh battery.</p>
      <p>The TECNO Phantom 9 is expected to launch in South Africa in early January 2020, and will be available from <a href="http://www.takealot.com/?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=November_Article"><b>Takealot</b></a> and <a href="http://www.tecnomobilesa.co.za/?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=November_Article"><b>TECNO’s South African website</b></a></p>
