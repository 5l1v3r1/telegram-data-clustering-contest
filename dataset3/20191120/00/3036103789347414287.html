      <h1>FNB users who trade cryptocurrency – What you need to know</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>FNB has given notice that it will terminate its banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges and related entities.</p>
      <p>While this may have a significant effect on exchanges and other intermediaries, it should not affect everyday FNB customers, even if they have purchased and sold cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>“FNB can confirm that it has given reasonable notice to terminate its banking services to Virtual Currency Exchanges and intermediaries trading in virtual currency,” the bank told MyBroadband.</p>
      <p>“FNB considers this to be a prudent course of action following a comprehensive review of the potential risks currently associated with these entities, particularly given that appropriate regulatory frameworks are not yet in place.”</p>
      <p>The bank added that it was not able to provide any information on specific bank accounts, but confirmed that individual customers would not be affected by its change in policy.</p>
      <p>“The decision to terminate our banking services to these entities does not apply to individual customers,” FNB said.</p>
      <h3>Exchange users not affected</h3>
      <p>A number of local exchanges told MyBroadband that FNB’s decision to close their accounts would not affect the users on their platforms.</p>
      <p>“We can confirm that FNB has decided to close our account with effect from end March 2020, along with other crypto exchanges in South Africa,” Luno Africa general manager Marius Reitz told MyBroadband.</p>
      <p>“We do not anticipate any impact to our existing customers as we have other banking relationships in place to support deposits and withdrawals on the platform.”</p>
      <p>ICE3X also told MyBroadband that it had been notified of its FNB accounts being shut down, adding that its customers would not be affected.</p>
      <p>“Our customers are unaffected as we have alternative banking arrangements for our deposits and withdrawals,” the exchange said.</p>
      <p>VALR co-founder Farzam Ehsani said the exchange’s FNB banking facilities remain operational and it is in discussions with FNB regarding the exact date of termination.</p>
      <p>“We will communicate this date to our customers in advance to ensure a seamless transition to our other banking partners, some of whom are already enabled on the VALR platform,” Ehsani said.</p>
      <p>Ehsani told VALR customers who bank with FNB that they might have to wait longer for their deposits to reflect in VALR’s system in future, as the exchange would no longer have an FNB account to receive deposits, resulting in customers being limited by inter-bank transfer times.</p>
      <h3>Regulation and outlook</h3>
      <p>Ehsani also told MyBroadband that VALR is encouraged by discussions with South African regulators and other South African banks that FNB’s decision remains an isolated case.</p>
      <p>Regulation around cryptocurrency and blockchain technology remains relatively undefined in South Africa, as in many other countries around the world.</p>
      <p>In January this year, the South African Intergovernmental FinTech Working Group (composed of SARB, FIC, FSCA, SARS, and National Treasury) issued the Consultation Paper on Policy Proposals for Crypto Assets.</p>
      <p>This paper aims to provide a regulated path forward for crypto-asset service providers in South Africa, including major exchanges.</p>
      <p>In June, The Financial Action Task Force – of which South Africa is a member – issued its “Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers”, which also provides a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
      <p>All the exchanges which spoke to MyBroadband said that they hoped FNB would revise its decision once the local regulation around cryptocurrency was clarified further.</p>
