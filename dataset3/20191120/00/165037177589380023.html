      </p>
      <p><b>Robert Lewandowski</b> is enjoying an outstanding start to the season with <b>Bayern Munich</b> but insists there is room for him to get even better.</p>
      <p>The Poland international has <b>23 goals in 18 club matches </b>so far this term, more than any other player in Europe's top leagues.</p>
      <p>However, Lewandowski believes he is only now <b>approaching his peak and can improve further</b>, insisting he does not feel his 31 years.</p>
      <p>"I worked very hard for this form. Currently it is going perfectly, my body feels good," he told Sport Bild.</p>

      <p>"I know when I can do more and when I need to slow down. My passport says: 'Robert Lewandowski, 31 years old'. But that's not how I feel. My best spell is just starting now and hopefully will continue for some more years. <b>The best is yet to come</b>."</p>
      <p><b>Lewandowski is set to return to club action</b> following the international break on Saturday, as Bayern visit Fortuna Dusseldorf.</p>
