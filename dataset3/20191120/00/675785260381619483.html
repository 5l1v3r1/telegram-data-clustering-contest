      <h2>The Church of England's two most senior clerics have waded into the election debate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:01:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Britain's top Anglican churchmen tonight urged voters to “honour the gift of truth” in the election campaign.</p>
      <p>The Archbishops of Canterbury and York called on electors to “leave our echo chambers” and listen to other viewpoints as the race for No10 hots up.</p>
      <p>Justin Welby and John Sentamu issued the pleas in a letter they hope will be shared in churches ahead of the crunch ballot on December 12.</p>
      <p>“As followers of Jesus Christ each of us is called to honour the gift of truth, both to speak it and to seek it,” they write.</p>
      <p>“We all have a responsibility to speak accurately, to challenge falsehoods when we hear them, and to be careful to separate facts from opinion.</p>

      <p>“Offering facts and opinions should be done with humility and in love.</p>
      <p>“People who hold different political views are not our enemies.”</p>
      <p>Reminding worshippers that “taking part in a democracy is a privilege and a responsibility”, they call on voters to “seek that common good that truly benefits us all”.</p>
      <p>Their letter stresses that “includes justice for the oppressed, protection for the persecuted, and a commitment to combat climate change and adapt to its effects”.</p>
      <p>It adds: “It also includes a just economic system, open and encouraging to aspiration and ambition, supportive of those who struggle.”</p>
