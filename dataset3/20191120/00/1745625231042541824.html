      <p>Aussie model <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/madi-edwards/">Madi Edwards</a> took to social media earlier today to delight fans with another stunning new snapshot. As her fans know, the blond-haired beauty has never shied away from flaunting her killer figure to fans in a wide range of sexy outfits that include bikinis, crop tops, and other sexy ensembles. In the latest photo that was shared on her page, Edwards stunned in an all-white outfit.</p>
      <p>In the post, the model tagged herself in Beverly Hills where she could be seen posing at the swanky Beverly Hills Hotel. Edwards looked nothing short of perfect in the image as she looked off into the distance with a big smile on her face. The blond-haired beauty wore her long locks down and curled in addition to a stunning application of makeup that came complete with eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipstick.</p>
      <p>The social media sensation had her killer figure on full display in the shot while she leaned against a pillar outside. On top, Edwards rocked a white off-the-shoulder crop top that showcased a hint of her tanned tummy. The bottoms were just as sexy with Edwards rocking a white mini skirt showed off her toned legs. The model accessorized the stunning look with a pearl necklace. In the caption of the shot, Edwards announced a competition to her fans for a chance to win a $500 Showpo voucher.</p>
