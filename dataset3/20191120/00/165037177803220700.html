        <b>Rodrygo Goes played just 21 minutes across two friendlies for Brazil, and Tite explained the reason behind his decision.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tite rejected criticism of his decision to play <b>Rodrygo</b> Goes for just <b>two minutes</b> in Brazil's 3-0 win over South Korea on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Brazil coach said on Monday he would be <b>patient</b> with the teenage forward, who has made an impressive start to life at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo has scored twice in four LaLiga appearances for <b>Madrid</b> and notched a hat-trick in their 6-0 Champions League demolition of Galatasaray this month.</p>

      <p>The 18-year-old got 19 minutes on his debut in the 1-0 loss to <b>Argentina</b> on Friday and received even less playing time in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>"It's one thing to throw Rodrygo into a system that's already <b>structured</b>, like Real's. It's another thing to put him in a team that is being reassembled, even if he was doing the same job in the same position," said Tite.</p>
      <p>"It was so hard to organise for the team for today and they responded well. They were <b>close to scoring </b>a fourth and a fifth.</p>
      <p>"It was a chance for <b>Fabinho</b>, Renan <b>Lodi</b> and <b>Militao</b>. They earned the chance and asserted themselves. Could it have been Rodrygo? Yes, but <b>I preserved the continuity</b> and the good moment of the team in the game."</p>
