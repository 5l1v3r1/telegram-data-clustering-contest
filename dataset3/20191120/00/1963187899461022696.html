      <p>CAIRO - 20 November 2019: The Ministry of Youth and Sports, through the Central Administrative Department for Minister's Affairs - the African Youth Bureau, has obtained the African Union Commission accreditation to implement its simulation model in Egypt after lengthy discussions that lasted from August to October 2019. <br/><br/>It should be noted that the African Youth Bureau, at its inception as an initiative, played a role in launching the African Union model in collaboration with the students group of the International Awareness Club at Cairo University in 2012, noting that the AU model was also launched in coordination and cooperation with the Central Administration of the Parliament and Civic education within the Ministry of Youth and Sports.</p>

      <p>Within the framework of the celebration of Africa Youth Month and on the youth engagement week, the African Union Youth Sector organized a training on the AU Model, with the participation of the African Youth Bureau represented by Ms. Alaa Zain, Project Coordinator of the AY Bureau. The training took place in the African Union HQ in Addis Ababa during the period from 11-16 November 2019. <br/><br/>The training was organized within the framework of the preparations for the African Union model in Egypt, organized by the Ministry of Youth and Sports in cooperation with Cairo University. <br/><br/>The 2019 African Union Model is held under the theme: “Children Today, Youth Tomorrow: a Smooth Transition”, in cooperation with different partners, namely: UNICEF and Save the Children, which is in alignment with the African Plan of Action on Youth Empowerment (APAYE) that highlights the need to take into acount the transition from childhood to youth, as well as to make deliberate efforts to address this matter.</p>

      <p>The African Union Model training aimed to promote independent AU Model simulations, particularly in Africa. <br/><br/>In order to empower and train youth, the training included dialogue sessions, workshops and simulations, that tackled different aspects as: <br/>intergenerational dialogue on community engagement in which H.E. Ms. Hanna Tetteh, Special Representative to the African Union and Head of the United Nations Office to the AU, Madam Charlotte O’Neal (Mama C) – Poet, Musician, Visual Artist and co-director of the United African-American Community Center, and Prof. Sarah Anyang Agbor, African Union Commissioner for Human Resources, Science and Technology, shared their community engagement experience with the young participants in a dialogue session moderated by Ms. Aya Chebbi, AU Youth Envoy. <br/><br/>The training provided young people with an opportunity to learn about the various AU youth development frameworks, such as the African Agenda 2063, the African Youth Charter, the African Plan of Action on Youth Empowerment (APAYE), and the 1 Million by 2021 Initiative, along with a training on youth advocacy. <br/><br/>With regard to the AU simulation, the training included a simulation of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACERWC) and a simulation of the Summit of Heads of State where participants acted as representatives of African governments and participated in debates on current issues on the AU agenda, resulting in the drafting of resolutions to resolve current challenges in Africa, which has, in turn, helped the young Africans to understand the AU's priorities and functions and has strengthened their strategic skills for effective decision-making, strategy development and implementation. . <br/><br/>The training was attended by over 100 participants from different African countries including: Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritius, Comoros, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Cap Verde, Mauritania, Cote d'Ivoire, Congo, Rwanda, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Djibouti, Guinea, Lesotho, Gabon, Angola,Togo, Seychelles, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Benin, Kenya, Cameroun, Mali, Namibia, Madagascar, Senegal, Mozambique,Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana and other African Countries and included the Africa Diaspora as well.</p>
