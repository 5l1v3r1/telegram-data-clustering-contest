        <b>GUESS what? Ireland are in the play-offs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I know, I know, cliché and all that, but here we go again. We're a nation seemingly incapable of ever doing things the easy the way (and we're not all that great at doing things the hard way either).</p>
      <p>But anyway, hopes of a glorious summer galavanting around the continent at Euro 2020 are still alive, we've just got to win a couple more matches to get there: a semi-final and final. Easy ... right?</p>

        <b>Who are Ireland playing?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We've been drawn against <b>Slovakia</b> in the semi-final.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When is the match?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It will take place on <b>26 March, 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where will it be played?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As we've been drawn away, the match will take place in the Slovakian city of <b>Trnava</b>, in the <b>Anton Malatinský Stadium</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How many legs will there be?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just <b>one</b>. The format has changed for this year's competition, meaning that both the semi-final and final of the play-offs are single-leg ties.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who will we play in the final?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If we beat Slovakia, we'll face either <b>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina or Northern Ireland</b> - a match which takes place on the same day as our tie with Slovakia.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When will the final be?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The final takes place five days after the semi-final ties, on <b>31 March, 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is our record like against Slovakia?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland and Slovakia have faced each other five times in their history, with Ireland winning one and the other four ending in draws (undefeated - wooo). The last time the two sides locked horns was in March 2016, where the game finished 2-2.</p>
