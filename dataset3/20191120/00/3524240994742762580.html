      <p>The Lagos State Government, on Tuesday, arraigned a dismissed cop, Olalekan Ogunyemi, before the state High Court in Ikeja for allegedly killing a football fan, Kolade Johnson.</p>
      <p><i>PUNCH Metro</i> had reported that Kolade was shot dead on March 31, 2019, when some policemen attached to the Anti-Cultism Unit of the Lagos State Police Command stormed Olu Aboderin Street in the Onipetesi area of the state.</p>
      <p>The victim was watching a football match between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>Ogunyemi, 45, was arraigned for murder on April 5 before an Ebute Meta Magistrates’ Court after an orderly room trial found him guilty of unlawful use of a firearm, but his plea was not taken and he was subsequently remanded in the Ikoyi Correctional Centre.</p>
      <p>Ogunyemi was alleged to have used his Ak-47 rifle to kill Kolade by shooting him in the lower abdomen.</p>
      <p>However, the Lagos State Government arraigned Ogunyemi on Tuesday on one count of murder before Justice A. J. Coker.</p>
      <p>He pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>
      <p>The offence was said to contravene Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015.</p>
      <p>Following his plea, the prosecutor, Y. G. Oshoala, urged the court to allow the dismissed cop to continue to be remanded in the correctional facility.</p>
      <p>“We ask that the defendant continue to be detained in prison custody before the trial date. Our witnesses are available and we are ready to commence the trial,” he said.</p>
      <p>Adjourning the case, Justice Coker urged the defence counsel, Ike Ezekwen, to intimate his client of the option of a plea bargain before the commencement of trial.</p>
      <p>Justice Coker adjourned the matter till January 15, 2020, and ordered that the defendant be remanded in the Ikoyi Correctional Centre.</p>
