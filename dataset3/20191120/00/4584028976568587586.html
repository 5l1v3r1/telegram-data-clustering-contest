      <p>A Jamaica Under-22 team will take on Japan at the Transcosmos Stadium in Nagasaki in a friendly scheduled for December 28, for the Kirin Challenge Cup 2019.</p>
      <p>Reggae Boyz head coach Theodore Whitmore will select and coach the squad for the match they will give the national technical staff the opportunity to look at potential players for the 2022 Senior World Cup campaign and assess their play under new and challenging conditions.</p>
      <p>Coach Whitmore will be assisted by Merron Gordon.</p>
      <p>The game is for players born or after January 1, 1997, with the option for a few overage players, if required.</p>
      <p>Coach Whitmore said earlier this year, that the period up to November 2019 was the time for talent identification and team technical identity. He noted, however, that the talent was evolutionary and there would always be opportunities for emerging talent.</p>
