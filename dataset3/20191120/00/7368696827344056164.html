      <p>Wooloo, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest-designed Pokemon in generations. Why it took Game Freak over twenty years to make a sheep Pokemon is still a mystery but I am glad they did. I may love the Pokemon but I don’t love it enough to only use it throughout the entire game as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheyTellMeItRained/">Reddit</a> user TheyTellMeItRained did.</p>

      <p>TheyTellMeItRained completed the entire game by only using one Pokemon and that monster was none other than Wooloo. Why is this a big deal? Well, Pokemon Sword and Shield are tough at some points and Wooloo, while being a cute ball of wool, is not the best Pokemon in the game. If anything, most people won’t even use him at all.</p>
      <p>The Reddit user had documented his journey with Wooloo in Pokemon Sword and Shield including beating all eight gym leaders and the Champion Cup. This is no small feat as the game’s difficulty curve often kicks in, trust me. The fact that TheyTellMeItRained managed to make it through fighting Pokemon that Wooloo could be weak to is a big deal. What is an even greater achievement is that Wooloo partnered up with Magikarp during double battles just to make things fair. Magikarp only had Splash which as we all know is a useless move.</p>
      <p>You can head over to the Reddit thread where the entire experience was documented. Be warned of spoilers though as the user goes into detail how he beat specific gym leaders and which Pokemon they used.</p>
      <p>Pokemon Sword and Shield are now available for Nintendo Switch. Stay tuned in the coming days as we will have our full review of the games to share with you.</p>
