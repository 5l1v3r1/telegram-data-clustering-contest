      <p>CHICAGO (AP) - The Latest on legal battle between city of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Jussie Smollett</a> (all times local):</p>
      <p>4:15 p.m.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> will continue in its efforts to recover the cost of the investigation into claims by former “Empire” actor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Jussie Smollett</a> that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.</p>
      <p>Chicago police say the alleged attack on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Smollett</a> was staged, and he was charged with making a false report. Prosecutors dropped the case in March.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Smollett</a>’s attorneys this week claimed the actor’s $10,000 payment after the close of a criminal case should prevent <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> from seeking reimbursement for a police investigation. On Tuesday, they filed a counterclaim against the city, accusing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> of malicious prosecution that caused humiliation and extreme distress.</p>

      <p>Bill McCaffrey, the spokesman for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a>’s law department, says the presiding judge has already ruled in the city’s favor and that officials “expect to be successful in defeating these counterclaims.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Smollett</a>’s attorneys filed a response Tuesday to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a>’s lawsuit in federal court. They also filed a counterclaim against the city, saying <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Smollett</a> was the victim of a malicious prosecution that caused humiliation and extreme distress.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Smollett</a> told police he was beaten in January by two men who looped a noose around his neck. Chicago police said it was staged, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Smollett</a> was charged with making a false report.</p>
        <p>But prosecutors in March dropped the case. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jussie-smollett/">Smollett</a> maintains his innocence but agreed to let authorities keep a $10,000 bail</p>
