      <h1>Checkers’ big plans for Black Friday 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Checkers has outlined its plans for <b><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/black-friday">Black Friday 2019</a> </b>which has become one of the biggest shopping days of the year for the retailer.</p>
      <p>Set to fall on 29 November, Checkers said that it will offer unbeatable deals on big-ticket items like tech and appliances.</p>
      <p>However, it said that will also cut prices on household essentials as it aims to become ‘the ultimate destination’ for Black Friday shopping.</p>
      <p>The group said that this year, members of its newly launched Xtra Savings rewards programme will be the first to receive advance notifications of the Black Friday deals on offer at Checkers, the retailer said.</p>
      <p>A total of two million customers have signed up for Xtra Savings in just 20 days following the launch of the rewards programme in mid-October.</p>
      <p>Shoppers still have time to join Xtra Savings ahead of this year’s Black Friday and can do so free of charge, and in less than three minutes, using a number of paperless channels.</p>
      <p>Xtra Savings members also stand a chance to win their Black Friday shopping for free, it said.</p>
      <p>“Extensive planning commences at least 6 months in advance to ensure we give customers the very best Black Friday experience,” said Willie Peters, GM of marketing at Shoprite and Checkers.</p>
      <p>“As with previous years, we will again stay true to what Black Friday is all about – deep-cut specials that offer real value. We have been hard at work to secure the best deals and to ensure all our stores are sufficiently stocked. We look forward to making this year’s Black Friday our biggest yet.</p>
      <p>“Considering the pressure many households are under given the current economic environment, we have worked closely with our suppliers to identify discounts that will provide meaningful savings and value to all.”</p>
