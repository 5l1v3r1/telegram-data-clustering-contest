      <p><b>to realize the geometric complexity of the project’s dynamic, white curtain wall, studio gang created a modular façade system consisting of families of units that repeat every 11 floors.</b> the engineering process was adapted from the aerospace industry to achieve the flat and clean look of the curtain wall’s italian-made white panels. the curtain wall is a part of a distinctive, spiraling design that transforms san francisco’s skyline with large bay windows that twist up the building’s façade to offer residents sweeping views.</p>

      <p><b><i>‘reinterpreting the classic bay windows of san francisco, our design amplifies the dynamic quality of the neighborhood,’</i> explains jeanne gang, founding principal of studio gang.</b> <i>‘spiraling all the way up this 400-foot tower, bay windows create unique spaces in every residence that offer fresh air, expansive views, and changing qualities of light throughout the day.’</i></p>
