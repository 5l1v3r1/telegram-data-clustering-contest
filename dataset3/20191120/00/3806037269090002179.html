      <p><a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/trippie-redd">Trippie Redd</a> continues to add new tracks to the rollout and promotional campaign for his next major studio project, <i>A Love Letter to You 4</i>. Following up last week’s collaboration with DaBaby, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/trippie-redd-death-dababy-song-video-stream">“Death,”</a> the Ohio superstar is unveiling a visualizer for one of <i>A Love Letter to You 4</i>‘s opening salvos, “Who Needs Love.”</p>
      <p>“A person like me, because I’m so melodic, I can go anywhere with my voice,” Trippie Redd previously explained to us during an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/trippie-redd-interview-micline-episode-36">August edition of our <i>MIC/LINE</i> podcast</a>. “That’s why it’s just so amazing to do rock, because you could just go anywhere. You could sing anything. I could sing anything.”</p>
      <p>“I record some shit and I always want it to mean something, I always want it to be deep,” Trippie Redd continued. “At the same time, the music is made for your interpretation; it’s not necessarily what I’ve been through … however you interpret the song, is however you interpret the song — it’s you.”</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the new visualizer for Trippie Redd’s latest single “Who Needs Love” above. Trippie Redd’s upcoming full-length project <i>A Love Letter to You 4</i> is scheduled to see release this Friday, November 22. Including “Who Needs Love,” <i>A Love Letter to You 4</i> will deliver 21 new songs to listeners, with additional contributions coming courtesy of YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Juice WRLD, YNW Melly, Tory Lanez, Lil Yachty, Smokepurpp and others.</p>
