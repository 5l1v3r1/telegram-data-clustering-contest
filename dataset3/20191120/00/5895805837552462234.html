      <p>Men tend to not engage in help-seeking behavior and downplay their physical and mental health symptoms [1] [2]. It doesn't take a psychologist to see the problem with this tendency. Unaddressed medical conditions will worsen over time if not treated. Mental illness, relational problems, addictions, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">traumas</a> also tend to worsen over time if not addressed. Certainly, men don't want unwieldy medical or mental health problems, so why the struggle to ask for help?</p>
      <p>Men associate seeking assistance for a psychological or emotional problem with <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">shame</a> or weakness.[3] It is sad, but true. Admitting a problem and seeking help is perceived as being weak. And what is seen as strong, tough, macho, and manly is avoiding problems, ignoring pain, and denying reality. And where are men getting the idea that asking for help is tantamount to weakness? Other men. Men are the worst offenders when it comes to judging and shaming men. They shoot their own, and kick a man when he's down.</p>
      <p><i>Our desire to be Superman is our Kryptonite.</i> We are killing ourselves. Men run the risk for some very serious negative health outcomes regarding cardiovascular and immune system health.[4] Furthermore, chronic <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> and unhealthy lifestyles are among the leading causes of morbidity and death.[5] All that stress, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a>, poor eating, and drinking goes straight to our hearts, literally. Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year, a number expected to grow to more than 23.6 million by 2030.[6] <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19523216/heart-disease-number-one-killer-of-men/">Heart disease is the number-one killer of men</a>. Other chronic conditions such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and high blood pressure are major contributors to illness and disability.[7] And since men aren't seeking medical <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a>, these conditions only worsen.</p>
      <p>The research shows a relationship between men avoiding/denying medical and mental health problems and an increase in <a href="https://bpl.berkeley.edu/docs/42-Emotional%20suppression93.pdf">self-destructive behaviors</a>. The widespread prevalence of health risks associated with <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/smoking">smoking</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol">alcohol abuse</a>, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/obesity">obesity</a> are of continuing public concern.[8][9] When men avoid problems and stuff their emotions they tend to act out by abusing alcohol, overeating, and smoking. Yet, drinking, eating and smoking too much are poor coping skills. They don't rectify problems. At best, they are distractions. At worst, they intensify existing problems.</p>
      <p>The evidence mentioned above is only the tip of the iceberg but it demands an answer from men. We can't ignore the negative implications of our behavior. Our choices affect others. Who pays the bill for our unmanaged medical issues? Who takes care of us or picks up the slack when we are at the hospital, or bed-bound? Who suffers from our acting out with food, smoking, and alcohol? Our partners, kids, co-workers, friends, and community members — the people who depend on us. Men, it wouldn't be as big of a deal if only you were harmed by your behavior. But its not just you who suffers from your choices. Everyone else is affected when you choose to not ask for help. And what kind of legacy are you leaving for younger men? What is the younger generation learning from your example?</p>
      <p>I say, time is up. Men need to re-associate what asking for help means. Why can't asking for help be associated with being smart, observant, aware, and wise? Men need to understand that admitting a problem is a sign of strength, not weakness. Men need to encourage other men, especially younger men, to be aware of problems and not ignore them. Where is the logic in making things worse by ignoring problems? Where is the manliness? Where is the strength in that?</p>

      <p>Submitted by Frank on November 20, 2019 - 6:11pm</p>
      <p>When men ask for help, they are often treated by a system that views men as less important than women.</p>
      <p>Friends of mine have gone to their HMO's depression class. There they are told that women have depression twice as often as men. When they point out the four-times-greater male suicide rate, they are told, "women attempt it more".</p>
      <p>In the USA, the Democrats created the Office of Women's Health back in 1995, but ignored men's health, both at that time and ever since. One office of women's health has morphed into many of them, but still not one office of men's health.</p>
      <p>Both the public sector and the private charitable sector spend many times more money on breast cancer than prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>There are reports coming from Australia in which prostate cancer patients in hospitals there are actually being mocked by the nursing staffs there.</p>
      <p>In 2008, Barack Obama created the White House Council for Girls and Women, but refused to create a comparable council for boys and men. Yesterday - International Men's Day - Dr. Warren Farrell announced that there will finally be a White House Council for Boys and Men - under President Trump.</p>
