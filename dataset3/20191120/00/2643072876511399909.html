      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party will hold an emergency meeting today, Wednesday, to deliberate on Saturday’s governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States.</p>
      <p>The PDP lost both elections conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>

      <p>Ologbondiyan said, <i>“We have not held a meeting. We are going to hold a meeting tomorrow.”</i></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Naija News</b> had reported that the All Progressives Congress (APC) had fixed Friday, November 22, 2019, for its <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/19/just-in-apc-set-to-hold-nec-meeting-on-friday/"><u><b>National Executive Council (NEC) meeting</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Though, there was no official statement from the party at the end of the meeting, it was gathered that the party would hold its caucus meeting at the Presidential Villa on Thursday ahead of the NEC meeting on Friday.</p>
      <p>According to a source privy to the meeting, the issues that would be discussed on Friday would be how to fill the vacant positions like National Auditor, a position held by <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/02/next-level-president-buhari-approves-appointment-of-moghalu/"><u><b>Mr. George Moghalu</b></u></a>, who was recently appointed as the Managing Director, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA); Deputy Vice Chairman, South, a position held by <b>Chief Niyi Adebayo</b>, who was also appointed as the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment; and the position of National Secretary, which was previously held by <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/03/11/inec-declares-apcs-buni-winner-of-yobe-guber-poll/"><u><b>Mr. Mai Mala Buni</b></u></a>, the Yobe State governor.</p>
      <p>Another issue to be discussed is the suspension of the Deputy National Chairman, North, <b>Senator Lawal Shuaibu</b>, who was suspended by NWC for alleged anti-party activities, as well as the suspension of National Vice Chairman, North-west, <b>Alhaji Inuwa Abdulkadir</b>, for the same offence.</p>
