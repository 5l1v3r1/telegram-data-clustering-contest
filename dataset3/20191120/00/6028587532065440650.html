      <p>In order to notch a triple-double against every team in the NBA, LeBron James had to be one of the greatest players in league history.</p>
      <p>No one doubts that is the case.</p>
      <p>But he also had to move around and play for multiple teams in both conferences in order to secure triple-doubles against his former teams the Cavaliers and Heat.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, James went for 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a win over the Thunder, making him the first player ever to notch a triple-double against every NBA team.</p>
      <p>“To be able to do that against every team is something special,” said Anthony Davis, who had 34 points in the win. “He’s been playing for a long time so it was a matter of time before it happened. It’s just a tribute to all his hard work.”</p>
      <p>James is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in front of him – Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson and Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd – hadn’t done it against 30 different teams. Russell Westbrook is next at 29 times, followed by Kidd at 28.</p>

      <p>Three more and he would’ve had a quadruple-double.</p>
      <p>James has won three NBA titles and is a four-time NBA MVP. He is already in the conversation for the GOAT along with Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and whoever else you want to throw in there.</p>
      <p>But this latest achievement underscores how versatile and multi-skilled he is as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator.</p>
      <p>“He’ll say it’s because he’s been in the league so long,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “But we all know it’s because he’s remarkable, and for him to be doing it as long as he’s been doing it, that’s how you knock out all 30… I don’t know if that will ever get accomplished again.”“I had seven turnovers, I was bad,” LeBron said. “I agreed with him.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know, I really don’t know what to think about it,” James said. “I’ve had some great teammates and coaches who put me in a position to facilitate… and hopefully, though all those triple-doubles, I’ve got a winning record in those games.”</p>
      <p>James, 34, is still playing at a very high level despite his age. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2019/03/06/without-lebron-james-in-the-nba-playoffs-tv-ratings-expected-to-take-a-hit/#5e5b793c78f6">After missing the playoffs last season for the first time since 2005</a>, he has more gas in the tank early in the season than in recent years.</p>
      <p>James is averaging 25.0 points, an NBA-best 11.1 assists and 7.9 rebounds.</p>
      <p>And he’s doing it for a Lakers team that at 12-2 has the NBA’s best record.</p>
      <p>The Lakers have won five straight and if the playoffs began today, which of course they don’t, they would be the top seed in the West.</p>
      <p>In the end, he cares more about challenging for another NBA title than he does about triple-doubles, but this latest accomplishment is something special.</p>
