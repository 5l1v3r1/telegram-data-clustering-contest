      <h3>Manchester United are hoping to sign both Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland in the January transfer window, according to reports.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-ready-to-spend-big-on-sancho-and-haaland-in-january/5nnf2uw06tag15uyshqnoic49">Goal</a> is reporting that the Red Devils are thinking about shelving transfer plans for Declan Rice and Mario Mandzukic in favour of bringing in Sancho and Haaland in the new year.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are set to be linked with a number of top players in the coming weeks as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks to bolster his squad during the midway point of the campaign.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Manchester United “believe” that there is a chance they will be able to sign Sancho from Dortmund in January.</p>
      <p>It claims that Sancho’s current situation at Dortmund has prompted suggestions that the German club may be prepared to do business in January after it had initially been presumed that any move would have to wait until the summer.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are also said to be thinking about bringing forward a deal to sign Red Bull Salzburg striker Haaland in January.</p>
      <p>Haaland has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester United in the last few days but it remains to be seen whether the Red Devils will be able to strike a deal in January.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will take on Sheffield United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon away from home.</p>
