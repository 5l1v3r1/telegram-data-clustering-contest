      <h1>Nokia's head of software says 5G development progressing</h1>

      <p>HELSINKI (Reuters) - The head of Nokia's software business Bhaskar Gorti defended the Finnish mobile network maker on Wednesday against market fears that it is lagging behind its peers Ericsson (BS:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/telefon-lm-ericsson">ERICAs</a>) and Huawei [HWT.UL] in 5G development.</p>
      <p>"I don't think we have a 5G problem," Gorti told Reuters in an interview, calling its development a marathon where a lot of focus had been put on the first ten minutes of the race.</p>
      <p>Last month Nokia (HE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/nokia-finland">NOKIA</a>) slashed its profit outlook for 2019 and 2020, saying it needed to spend more to fend off its rivals.</p>
      <p>That was in sharp contrast to Sweden's Ericsson, which had lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020 just a week earlier.</p>
      <p>"We are in different phases and different leadership positions in different parts of that cycle," Gorti said.</p>
