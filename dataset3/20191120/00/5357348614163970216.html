        <b>THE National College for Educational Leadership (NCEL), in collaboration with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), will be piloting an online leadership course on child-friendly Schools (CFS).</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Ministry of Education release said the course is being rolled as the world readies to celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC) which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989.</p>
      <p>The CRC is a human rights treaty which addresses the civil, social, health and cultural rights of the child. As a party to the CRC, Jamaica is bound by international law to ensure that all children are provided with the health care, nutrition, education and protection that they need to survive and develop into global citizens.</p>
      <p>“The successful implementation of this widely ratified human rights treaty will be contingent on educational programmes that are designed to introduce all stakeholders, particularly educators, to the importance of creating and maintaining an enabling environment in which children's voices are heard as they actively participate in their own learning experiences,” said the release.</p>
      <p>The online leadership course is designed by NCEL and UNICEF for school administrators and incorporates relevant, locally produced video content that are aligned to open access articles focusing on child-friendly learning environments, policies and processes.</p>
      <p>“It is grounded in the premise that schools should be a safe place where children are nurtured and feel a sense of belonging,” said the release.</p>
