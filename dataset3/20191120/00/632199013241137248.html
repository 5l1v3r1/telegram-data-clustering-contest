      <p>Skoda has confirmed the pricing for its first fully electric production car, the Citigo e.</p>
      <p>Sharing a platform with the VW e-UP and Seat Mii Electric, the compact model features a 36.8kWh battery - giving a range of 170 miles.</p>
      <p>Ordering will commence on December 10 with the first new models arriving on UK roads in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Skoda says the car has been completely re-engineered to incorporate the battery pack and electric motor, enabling the car to provide the same boot space as the petrol powered car.</p>

      <p>There are two familiar trim grades: SE and SE L. SE models are equipped with climate control air conditioning, three spoke leather steering wheel and handbrake lever, DAB and remote central locking.</p>
      <p>The higher-specification SE L model is priced from £22,815 and adds 16-inch alloy wheels, ambient lighting, heated front seats, rear parking sensors and body coloured door mirrors and handles.</p>
      <p>With a 7.2kW wall box, the battery can be charged to 80% in four hours and 15 minutes, or 12 hours 37 minutes using a lower-powered 3.6kW home‑charging station.</p>
      <p>The SE L model can be charged faster using a CCS (Combined Charging System) charging cable connected to a 40kW DC fast charger. When recharging via CCS, the Citigo e’s battery can be recharged to 80% per cent in 60 minutes.</p>

      <p>Both models can be linked to the ŠKODA Connect app, which allows owners to check and control selected features of the car remotely. This means owners can check the charge status of the battery at all times.</p>
      <p>With 210Nm of torque, the Citigo e provides instant acceleration and can sprint from 0-62mph in 12.5 seconds, while top speed is 81mph.</p>
