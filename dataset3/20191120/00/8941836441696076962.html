      <p>NEW ORLEANS (AP) - New Orleans’ funk, soul, hip-hop and spoken-word ensemble known as Tank and the Bangas has gotten a Grammy nod for best new artist of the year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/times-picayune/">Times-Picayune</a>/The New Orleans Advocate reports other New Orleans artists making the list announced Wednesday include the Rebirth Brass Band, R&amp;B; singer and keyboardist PJ Morton, jazz trumpeter Christian Scott and saxophonist Branford Marsalis.</p>
      <p>Tank and the Bangas’ nomination is noteworthy because New Orleans acts rarely appear in the top four Grammy categories - record, album and song of the year, and best new artist.</p>
      <p>Others nominated in the new artist category are 17-year-old alternative rock sensation Billie Eilish, contemporty R&amp;b; star Lizzo and Lil Nas X of “Old Town Road” fame.</p>
