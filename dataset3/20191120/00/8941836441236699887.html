      <p>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) - A federal judge is expected to hear a proposed plea agreement in the case of the friend of the gunman in the deadly Dayton mass shooting.</p>
      <p>Court documents show 24-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ethan-kollie/">Ethan Kollie</a> plans to plead guilty Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Details of his plea agreement haven’t been disclosed. He is accused of lying on a federal firearms form and possessing a gun while using illegal drugs. The gun was unrelated to the Dayton shooting.</p>
      <p>Attorney Nick Gounaris (goo-NAIR’-is) said Tuesday he will ask that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ethan-kollie/">Kollie</a> be released pending sentencing.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said there’s no indication <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ethan-kollie/">Kollie</a> knew Connor Betts was planning the Aug. 4 shooting that killed nine people before police killed Betts.</p>
