      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:36:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The deals on gaming laptops just keep coming, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a> isn't even here yet. Now you can get a Dell G3 15 gaming laptop with a GTX 1660 Ti graphics card for just $699.99. Not only is that $300 below the original price, but it's also significantly cheaper than most other laptops with the same GPU.</p>
      <p>The specifications on this model include an Intel Core i5-9300H processor, 8GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD, a 15.6-inch 1080p 60Hz screen, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card. Windows 10 Home is pre-installed.</p>
      <p>This is an excellent deal, mostly because the vast majority of laptops with a GTX 1660 Ti GPU <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100167732%20601329747">cost around $1,000</a>, and this Dell G3 is a penny under $700. Also, Dell's G3 lineup is <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/us/en/04/g-series-15-3579-laptop/dell-g3-3579-servicemanual/before-working-inside-your-computer?guid=guid-5d3b1051-9384-409a-8d5b-9b53bd496de8&amp;lang=en-us">easily serviceable</a>, so you can upgrade the RAM or SSD at a later date without too much trouble.</p>
