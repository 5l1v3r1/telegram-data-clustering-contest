        <b>Angel Broking's report on Copper</b>
      </p>
      <p>Copper On Tuesday, copper prices on the LME ended higher by 0.77 percent to close at $5875.0 per tonne. Prices gained reflecting an uptrend in Shanghai copper after China’s central bank announced to provide more stimulus measures to try and get their economy back on track.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>No concrete outcome of the U.S.-China trade spat might weigh on the market sentiments and push the prices lower. On the MCX, Copper prices are expected to trade sideways today; international markets trading lower by 0.17 percent at $5871.5 per tonne.</p>
