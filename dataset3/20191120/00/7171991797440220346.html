      <h1>DIY Photo Backup In The Field</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/bryancockfield/" target="_blank">Bryan Cockfield</a></address>
      <p>They say a file isn’t backed up if it isn’t backed up twice. This is easy enough to do if you have access to your computer and a network, but if you’re a photographer you might end up in a place without either of these things and need a way to back up the files you just created. For that you’ll need a <a href="https://dphacks.com/2019/11/14/diy-portable-photo-backup-device/">specialized photo backup tool which you can easily build yourself</a>.</p>
      <p>While commercial offerings are available which back up files locally from a camera’s SD card to another medium, they suffer from a high price. [André]’s solution can be had for a fraction of that cost. Using a Raspberry Pi Zero, a tiny USB hub, and a high capacity jump drive, a photographer can simply plug in an SD card and the Pi will handle the backups with varying levels of automation. The software that [André] made use of is called Little Backup Box and can be used typically as an automatic backup for any other device as well.</p>
      <p>This is a great solution to backing up files on the go, whether they’re from a camera or any device that uses an SD card. Removable storage is tiny and easily lost, so it’s good to have a few backups in case the inevitable happens. Raspberry Pis are an <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/05/12/rackmount-raspi-leaves-no-excuse-to-lose-data/">ideal solution to data backup</a>, and can even be <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/03/17/battery-backup-for-the-raspberry-pi/">battery powered</a> if you’re really roughing it for a few days.</p>
