      <p>There was excitement in parliament especially among majority members of Parliament (MPs),when the now popular Ekumfi Fruit Juice product known as “Eku Juice” popped up in the law making chamber during the 2020 budget debate. <br/><br/>The Minister for Information and MP for Ofoase Ayirebi, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah displayed the nicely well packaged juice on Monday, 18 November 2019,while contributing to the budget debate focusing on the benefits of flagship programmes introduced by President Akufo-Addo.<br/><br/>The Pineapple Juice from the Ekumfi Juice Factory is under the government’s One District One factory programme. <br/><br/>Mr Nkrumah told the house many of the flagship programmes were yielding results including the factories under the 1D1F.<br/><br/>“When we rolled out the 1D1F Programme, there was a lot of mockery but that flagship programme in addition to the stimulus package that was provided is beginning to bear fruit. I hold in my hands here Eku Juice from the Ekumfi Juice Factory soon to be rolled out onto the market. Another project of the Akufo-Addo administration in the Central Region which was subjected to so much ridicule, but today that flagship programme is beginning to bear fruit” he said.<br/><br/>The USD8 million project which officially commenced in March 2018 now has 400 workers including out-growers. <br/><br/>It is estimated that the Ekumfi Juice Factory would create 5,000 direct out-grower jobs within the community and its environs. <br/><br/>The factory can process about 300,000,000 packs of juice annually for the local and export markets and would generate close to GHS530 million in revenue.<br/>Featured Video</p>
