      <p>Tottenham announced on Tuesday the departure of Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino. <br/><br/>The club said in a statement on its website that the two parties reached an agreement to secede by mutual consent. <br/><br/>Prior to the Pochettino era, Tottenham were in the top four in the Premier League with their new system (22 seasons) only twice, while the Argentine coach managed to lead the team four times in five seasons. <br/><br/>The Telegraph revealed that without a dramatic development between Pochettino and Tottenham's management, it is impossible for the Argentine to continue until the end of the season, because the loss from West Ham would be a disaster at the club. <br/><br/>"Levy preferred not to sack him, not because of the money, but for what he did with the team, but the Argentine coach made it seem like he would rather leave." <br/><br/>The British newspaper pointed out that his departure would cost Â£ 12.5 million either for him or him if he left an article or to another team.</p>
