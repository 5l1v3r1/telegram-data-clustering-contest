      <p>Former Manchester United coach, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/16/epl-tottenham-hotspur-makes-contact-with-mourinho/"><u><b>Jose Mourinho</b></u></a>, has emerged favourite to replace sacked Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/19/epl-tottenham-hotspur-sack-manager-pochettino/"><u><b>Tottenham</b></u></a> on Tuesday night announced the sacking of the former Southampton manager.</p>
      <p>The Argentine spent five years in charge of the North London side.</p>
      <p>Pochettino led Spurs to top-four finishes in four of his five seasons in charge, as well as their first <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/07/champions-league-top-goal-scorers-so-far-see-top-18/"><u><b>Champions League</b></u></a> final in the 2018/19 campaign.</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently languishing in 14th place in the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/14/epl-premier-league-reveals-2020-transfer-window-dates/"><u><b>Premier League</b></u></a> following a poor start to the season which has left them 20th points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Pochettino’s coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez were also relieved of their duties.</p>
      <p>According to Sky Sports, Mourinho, who was sacked by <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/05/epl-solskjaer-manchester-united-transfer-policy/"><u><b>Man United</b></u></a> last December, is a serious contender to replace Pochettino as Tottenham manager.</p>
      <p>The newspaper reports that RB Leipzig manager, Julian Nagelsmann, is also among the list.</p>
