      <h1>WhatsApp beta update for iOS – What you need to know</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>WhatsApp has recently launched a new iOS beta update – version 2.19.120.21 – through its TestFlight Beta Program, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-2-19-120-21-whats-new/"><b>WABetaInfo</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>The new update includes the upcoming blocked contact notice feature, although this is not usable yet.</p>
      <p>When active, this feature will show users a message within a chat if they block or unblock the other user – helping these users to document when they executed these functionalities.</p>
      <p>This notice is only shown to whoever blocks another user – the blocked user will not be notified.</p>
      <p>The blocked user will still be able to determine that they’ve been blocked, however, as they will not be able to see your profile picture any longer unless your privacy is set to nobody.</p>
      <p>The user will also be able to unblock the contact directly from the same chat by tapping on the notice.</p>
      <p>The feature first underwent testing on Android beta version 2.19.332, and there are now signs on the iOS app that it is also under development.</p>
      <h3>Facebook Pay</h3>
      <p>This new beta version of iOS also includes information about Facebook Pay’s implementation within the iOS WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>This comprises a section within the settings menu which is titled “Facebook Pay” and is designed to display which payment methods the user has added to their profile.</p>
      <p>However, this functionality is not yet active, and there is no indication of when it will be implemented.</p>
