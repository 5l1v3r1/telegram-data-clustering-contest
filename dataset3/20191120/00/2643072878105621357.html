      <p>The founder of the Christ Mercy Ministry, Pastor <b>Sunday Egbo</b>, was on Tuesday paraded by the Enugu State Police Command for alleged rape and involvement in money rituals.</p>
      <p>The commissioner of police in the state, Ahmed Abdur-Rahman while parading the cleric and 36 others at the command headquarters, noted that the Egbo had on November 9, 2019, invited a female member of his church under the pretext of organising a crusade starting from 6 pm.</p>
      <p>Abdur-Rahman stated that the pastor asked the female church member to come along with the picture of her sick brother for prayers.</p>
      <p>Abdur-Rahman stated, <i>“On arrival, the pastor took her to his house and left while pretending to go and bring other people, who were supposed to participate in for the programme, but he returned around 11pm and dragged her into his room, brought out a magic stone and threatened to kill her if she raised the alarm.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“He ordered her to remove her clothes, but the victim refused and the pastor slapped her and tore her clothes and raped her.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Egbo seized her pants, brassiere and brought out a small bottle and wanted to insert it in her private parts, but she struggled and ran naked to the door and shouted, which attracted neighbours, who invited the police to rescue her and arrest the pastor.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Egbo admitted to the crime during an interview with newsmen, when asked why he was arrested by the police.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I actually raped her in my house”.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The pastor noted that he approached a native doctor in Kogi State in his quest to be rich, he further revealed that the native doctor in question gave him a small coffin and other items and asked him to follow some instructions and he would become a millionaire.</p>
      <p>He stated, <i>“I paid the native doctor N200,000 to get the coffin and flute. He told me to do certain things, after which I would get a Ghana-Must-Go bag full of money in my room.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“But after two weeks, the money did not come as the native doctor had assured me.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The state commissioner of police warned criminals in the state to repent or move out of the state as the command would stop at nothing to fish them out.</p>
      <p>He said the 36 other suspects paraded committed various offences ranging from conspiracy, cultism, armed robbery, unlawful possession of firearms, murder and vandalism.</p>
      <p>Abdur-Rahman said their arrests were made possible through intelligence-led policing measures in collaboration with local vigilante groups.</p>
