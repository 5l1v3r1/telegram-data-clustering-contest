      <p>“What an honor to sit [with] The First Lady at the White House,” <a href="https://twitter.com/billyraycyrus/status/1196878098219835392?s=20">tweeted</a> Cyrus on Tuesday. “@FLOTUS Your sincerity was truly inspiring. You/your team were so engaged to Channing’s grieving father &amp; brother &amp; brought ideas/strategy to make the world a safer better place for the youth in America.”</p>
      <p>The tweet was accompanied by the hashtag, #JusticeForChanning, in reference to 16-year-old Channing Smith, who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/tennessee-teen-dies-suicide-after-being-outed-online-n1060436">reportedly</a> committed suicide in September, after he discovered that sexually explicit text messages he had exchanged with another boy from school were posted on social media by his classmates.</p>

      <p>After learning about Smith’s death, Cyrus had <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/19/billy-ray-cyrus-channing-smith-family-visit-melania-trump-white-house/4242289002/">performed</a> at a memorial service for the teenager in Manchester.</p>
      <p>“Highlighting online safety is one of my #BeBest priorities,” <a href="https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/1196854482228989952?s=20">tweeted</a> Melania Trump. “Yesterday, [Billy Ray Cyrus] introduced me to the Smith family to hear about the tragic loss of their loved one from cyberbullying. Teaching positive online behaviors can ensure a safer future for our children.”</p>
      <p>Trump had launched her “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/08/20/first-lady-melania-trump-tells-parents-help-kids-stop-cyberbullying/">Be Best</a>” initiative in May of last year, which she said would focus on “the many issues facing children today — one of them being the safe and responsible use of social media.”</p>
      <p>The First Lady referred to social media as “an inevitable part of our children’s daily lives” that can be “destructive and harmful when used incorrectly.”</p>
