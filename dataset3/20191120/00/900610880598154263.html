      <p>With the focus on strengthening its global connectivity, All Nippon Airways (ANA) has added five new cities to its network from Tokyo Haneda International Airport (HND)—Istanbul, Milan, Moscow, Shenzhen and Stockholm. The new services will be rolled out on March 29, 2020 and shall continue until October, 24, 2020.</p>
      <p>With this, the total number of international cities under ANA’s network will increase to 52.</p>
      <p>Commenting on this robust expansion, Seiichi Takahashi, senior vice president of ANA said “There is growing demand to visit Japan, and ANA will increase its international service just as Haneda Airport also expands to adapt for inbound Japanese tourism.These new routes will increase the ease and convenience for passengers flying to Japan from across the world, a significant benefit of our dual hub strategy.”</p>
      <p>Japan’s largest airline is also set to increase frequency on Haneda-Los Angeles and Haneda-Sydney sectors. In addition to this, the airline’s Delhi, Houston, Los Angeles, San Jose, Seattle and Washington D.C. routes will be relocated to HND. These new slots for Haneda increase the number of international flights ANA will offer during local daytime hours. <a href="https://www.ana.co.jp/en/in/?cid=SEAgoogleindia201506044766&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAws7uBRAkEiwAMlbZjrijXmW6rKwjxYq4m27ALW-7-Smo7N7xmgbN5_9aXTPyB7xFGvQdXBoCrUAQAvD_BwE#396457268840"><b>ana.co.jp</b></a></p>
