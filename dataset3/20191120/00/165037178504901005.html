      <h1>Lack of Champions League begins to hit Man Utd finances</h1>

        <b>Manchester United's failure to qualify for the Champions League is beginning to erode the club's finances, but increased commercial income helped the English giants post revenues of £135.4 million ($174 million) for the first quarter of the 2019-2020 season on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That represents a <b>£400,000 increase on the same period </b>for the previous year thanks to <b>more sponsorship income</b> and<b> two extra home games</b> compared to the same stage of last season.</p>
      <p>Broadcasting revenue fell by nearly <b>£10 million due to a lack of Champions League football,</b> which will make an even bigger impact in figures for<b> the second quarter of the year</b> when five of the six group games are played.</p>
      <p><b>United are expecting the 2020 annual revenue to fall to between £560-580 million,</b> compared to £627 million for the year ending June 30, 2019 due to the lack of Champions League revenue.</p>
      <p>However, the failure to qualify for the competition is also reflected in <b>a 6.8 million drop in the club's wage bill </b>for the first quarter of the season.</p>
