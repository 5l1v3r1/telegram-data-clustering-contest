      </p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman said Georginio <b>Wijnaldum</b> feels "<b>so happy with this Dutch team</b>" after his<b> Netherlands side beat Estonia 5-0</b> without any signs of the racism that blighted a league game in the country two days earlier.</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum went on to be the game's <b>star player</b>, netting the opening goal and going on to score two more, while Nathan Ake and Myron Boadu also got on the score sheet in Amsterdam on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Netherlands head coach Koeman revealed Wijnaldum was in<b> high spirits after the match</b>, and not just because of his goals.</p>
      <p>"Gini just said something about it in the dressing room during our <b>closing words</b> with each other," Koeman told Dutch broadcaster NOS.</p>
      <p>"He said he feels so happy with this Dutch team, where <b>this problem does not occur</b>.</p>
      <p>"<b>It is one team</b>. It's nice to see that again."</p>

      <p>Koeman made<b> seven changes</b> to the side that drew 0-0 with Northern Ireland three days earlier but still saw his players deliver a cohesive, confident performance.</p>
      <p>While the likes of <b>Ake</b>, <b>Wijnaldum</b>, Frenkie <b>de Jong</b> and Matthijs <b>de Ligt</b> were outstanding against Estonia, Koeman said he will utilise friendly matches in March to finalise his squad selections for <b>Euro 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>"It would be <b>very strange</b> if everything was clear against Estonia in one evening," said Koeman. "We still have six months.</p>
      <p>"We have a lot of <b>young players</b> who will be half a year later. It will be a fight. strong possible selection.</p>
      <p>"You use March for<b> points of discussion</b> within the selection. I will therefore let many players play.</p>
      <p>"We then play<b> two international matches</b> and have consciously opted for Thursday and Sunday. We will not play with the same team twice."</p>
