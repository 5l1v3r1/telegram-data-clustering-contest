      <p>Did you ever realize that both <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/troian-bellisario/"><b>Troian Bellisario</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/shay-mitchell/"><b>Shay Mitchell</b></a> gave their daughters names that start with the letter “A”?!</p>
      <p>If you watched <b><i>Pretty Little Liars</i></b>, then you know why this is such a crazy coincidence. Neither of them planned their daughters’ names to connect to the show though.</p>
      <p><b>Troian</b> and husband <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/patrick-j-adams/"><b>Patrick J. Adams</b></a> named their daughter <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/aurora-adams/"><b>Aurora</b></a> while <b>Shay </b>and boyfriend <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/matte-babel/"><b>Matte Babel</b></a> named their daughter <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/atlas-babel/"><b>Atlas</b></a>.</p>
      <p>“Well, it never crossed my mind until, like, an initial occurred. We were playing in our playroom and I just put A’s everywhere, and then I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve done it to myself!’” <b>Troian</b> told <i><a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/troian-bellisario-pll-whered-you-go-bernadette-daughter-aurora">Teen Vogue</a></i> about choosing her daughter’s name. “I have nobody to blame for this, and it’s so funny that a motif will crop up in your life totally unconsciously.”</p>
      <p><b>Troian</b> said that<b> Aurora </b>comes from Roman mythology, not the movie <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s really funny, because I didn’t tell [<b>Patrick</b>] that Aurora… he didn’t know that Aurora was a Disney princess’s name. I didn’t even think of it, honestly. ‘Cause I was thinking about it in terms of the historical context. So many people now are like, ‘Oh, like a Disney princess?’ And I feel like <b>Patrick</b>‘s like, ‘Ugh,’” she said.</p>
      <p><b>Troian</b> also opened up about <b>Shay</b>‘s daughter having an “A” name.</p>
      <p>“Oh, that’s so funny. No, that is a name that she told me she’s had since she was young, so way before <i>Pretty Little Liars</i>. It just happened that we want our children to go with the first of the class and everything, I guess,” she said.</p>
