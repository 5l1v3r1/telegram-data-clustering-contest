      <p>Banned networking and smartphone Company Huawei has officially confirmed that they are set to partner with Devialet with the French Companies sound technology set to be built in a new Huawei speakers, smartphones and the Companies MatePad Pro tablet.</p>
      <p>Sources in Shenzhen where I am at the moment said that Huawei approach several sound Companies prior to cracking a deal with Devialet whose products are distributed in Australia by Melbourne base Aqipa.</p>
      <p>The first of the new Huawei products featuring Devialet technology will be the Sound X speakers which will be announced on November 25, alongside the MatePad Pro flagship tablet.</p>
      <p>The Devialet Phantom range of speakers, especially the Silver Phantom and Phantom Gold were originally distributed in Australia by Interdyn, then when Aqipa took over they launched a low cost Devialet speaker that has been getting good reviews.</p>

      <p>A leaked manual has revealed that the Sound X will be powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core processor featuring 512MB of RAM and 8GB of storage. There will be two 60W subwoofers and six 1.5W tweeters for a 360° 5.1 home theatre surround sound experience. The Sound X connects via Bluetooth 5.0 to your phone and supports 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi networks.</p>
      <p>The Sound X is also a smart speaker. So, you can control your lights, robot vacuum cleaner, and smart plugs using Huawei’s a Huawei HiLink app.</p>
      <p>The speaker will reportedly come with six microphones that can pick up your voice from up to 5 meters away.</p>
      <p>At this stage it’s not known whether Huawei who are banned by the Australian Government from supplying 5G technology to Australian carriers will launch the new speaker next year in Australia.</p>
