      <p>An arguably much-needed rebranding is taking place. Until recently, the rise in average temperatures across the earth was usually referred to in neutral-sounding terms, such as “global warming” or climate change. Today we talk instead of a “climate emergency” and protesters are taking to the streets under the banner of Extinction Rebellion. Clearly, something has to be done but that’s where the urgency of the situation runs up against the reality of reducing emissions on a heavily-populated planet that still runs on coal, oil and gas. The technologies of the past have created the problem. So can the technologies of tomorrow help to solve it?  And if so how?   </p>
      <p>To see if I can find at least a partial answer to that question, I’m collecting my pass at the entrance to B., a co-working complex situated in a fairly unlovely district of Amsterdam. Inside, technology startups from around the world have gathered to take part in the 2019<a href="https://climatelaunchpad.org/"> Climate Launchpad</a>, a competition staged by <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">Climate KIC.</a>  </p>
      <p>The word competition is slightly misleading. Yes, there are prizes for winning entries, but arguably the real value of the exercise lies in several months of financial support, mentoring and coaching for the participants, culminating in a two-day competitive event.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Bigger Picture</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good news for the startups then, but what about the bigger picture? A lot of the businesses taking part are at the very earliest point of their development. Some are up and running with a product and service but others still are at the prototype stage. So can such nascent ventures really make a difference in a world where the speed of climate change appears to be accelerating?  </p>
      <p>Certainly, there are a lot of ideas, technologies and business models on show that directly address the climate change issue.  </p>
      <p>Treeconomy is a case in point. Founded by Harry Grocott and Rob Godfrey, the company plans to use equipment mounted on drones to measure the amount of carbon that is sequestered by trees in designated areas. Once logged, the data becomes an evidential tool that can put a financial value on trees, based on the amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere. This, according to Grocott and Godfrey, will make the planting of trees a financially attractive prospect for investors and landowners.  </p>
      <p>But it’s early days. Last week, the company spoke to a landowner who is keen to join the Beta tests. “His enthusiasm was considerable,” says Grocott. “The next stage is finding someone to sell to.”  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Sequestering Carbon</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nick Oseyko from Ukraine is also at early-stage. As he explains, the company he founded with his daughter Vika -<a href="https://carbominer.com/"> Carbominer</a> - has developed technology that sequesters carbon from the air and channels it to greenhouse operators. A prototype is ready and by 2020, Oseyko aims to be capturing CO2 at a commercially viable scale. “We’ll be putting a modular unit next to greenhouses,” Oseyko says.  In practical terms, the company says that its prospective units will be able to take out 500 tons of Carbon a year. The effects will be local, but the system can be scaled up nationally and globally. </p>
      <p>Others are addressing climate change less directly. <a href="https://bluelobster.app/">Blue Lobster</a> from Denmark is a market platform connecting fishing boat operators with consumers who are local to them. As co-founder Nima Sophia Tisdall explains, fish in Denmark tend to be distributed via big logistics centers and when they get to supermarkets they are not necessarily fresh. The Blue Lobster market not only facilitates delivery of fresher produce from dock to local markets, but also saves on carbon emissions. “We save 92 percent of emissions on average for each fish,” she says. </p>
      <p>
        <b>And The Winner Is</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the ultimate winner of the contest - Kenya’s Leafy Ke - has created low carbon fuel gel from waste diapers. The company aims to solve the problem of providing home fuels, which are also low in terms of carbon monoxide and CO2 emissions.  </p>
      <p>The enthusiasm in and around the competition is palpable - perhaps amplified by months of coaching on the value of the positive sell - but can the efforts of small firms, contribute to a bigger carbon reduction agenda? </p>
      <p>
        <b>Making Connections</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s where Climate KIC aims to help. Describing itself as a knowledge and innovation community, the organization was created by the European Union to address the climate change problem through the kind of innovative companies that are taking part in this year's competition. Crucially, however, it also aims to maximize the abilities of startup companies to make a genuine impact. </p>
      <p>Tom Mitchell, is Chief Strategy Officer at Climate KIC and one of his key roles is to connect innovators with those who are leading large-scale carbon reduction and cleantech programs. He cites city authorities as important players. “Cities are targeting net-zero emissions, but they don’t know how to get there,” he says. </p>
      <p>So Climate KIC provides support. “We map the cities and tell them where the pain points are,” he says. “And we develop programs.”  At present fifteen cities are working with Climate KIC. </p>
      <p>Typically, there can be a great many solutions open to city authorities - ranging from solar rooftops through clean urban mobility via bikes or scooters and/or traffic restrictions. The challenge is to bring it all together. Through accelerators, competitions and challenges, Climate KIC sets out to bring innovation to the surface while providing financial support and introductions to investors. The support extends to introducing innovators to city authorities. Climate KIC is also working with corporations in industries such as food production, agriculture and automotive. “We work with those who will engage with us at the boardroom level where decisions can be made,” says Mitchell. </p>
      <p>Ultimately, if warming is to be stopped or reversed, the real heavy lifting will probably have to be done through regulation at city, regional or national level and is likely to involve major initiatives, such as the phasing out of internal combustion engines, home insulation programs, higher flight prices, carbon taxes, tree planting and new forms of home heating. These are big programs, which will require huge investment. Indeed, as I write, the British Green party has published its manifesto promising to spend £100 billion a year to create a carbon-neutral economy.</p>
      <p>Against this backdrop, technology companies, small and large can doubtless play their part, but it remains to be seen what the scale of their individual impact will be. </p>
