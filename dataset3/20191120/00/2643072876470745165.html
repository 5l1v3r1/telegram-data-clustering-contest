      <h1>2023: Tinubu Fit To Be President – Guru Maharaj Ji</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>The founder of One Love Family, Satguru Maharaj Ji, has said the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/19/tinubu-reacts-as-inec-declares-kogi-bayelsa-election-winners/"><u><b>Bola Tinubu</b></u></a>, was fit to be president in 2023.</p>
      <p>He made this known on Wednesday while speaking at a news conference held at his Maharaj Ji village</p>
      <p>According to NAN, Maharaj Ji said anybody could become president as long as such individual has Nigeria interest at heart.</p>
      <p><i>“Anybody can become the president of Nigeria as long as he or she places the interest of the country above personal interest,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“If there is anyone who is fit in the south, it is Sen. Bola Tinubu. So, I will offer him for president if the presidency would be zoned to South-West.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“This is because he has been able to play the role of a mobiliser and bridge-builder across the country. Also, Peter Obi is a fine choice from the South-East.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The clergyman also called on the federal government to establish education bank to avail indigent Nigerians access to quality education.</p>
      <p><i>“The bank can pay for an individual’s education so that the person pays back upon getting a job after graduation. This will be paid back through a stipulated percentage of salary over a period of time,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Maharaj Ji expressed dissatisfaction with the state of affairs of the country, urging Buhari to do more in salvaging the situation.</p>
