      <h1>Steve Irwin's son Robert talks of his pride walking sister Bindi down the aisle</h1>
      <h2>The Crocodile Hunter's sister Joy Muscillo revealed last month that some of the Irwin family don't speak more than 13 years after the Australian television star was killed by a stingray</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:26:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:26</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Robert Irwin says it was an honour to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bindi-irwin-wedding-elephant-poo-20705276">walk his sister Bindi down the aisle</a> as she married the "perfect" Chandler Powell.</p>
      <p>Steve Irwin's kids showed a united front after suggestions a family feud was tearing them apart.</p>
      <p>It was reported in September that members of their clan have fallen out and no longer speak 13 years after his death.</p>
      <p>The once close-knit family changed after he was killed by a stingray in 2006, said the Crocodile Hunter's sister Joy Muscillo.</p>
      <p>Bindi's big day was a huge thing for Robert, 15, as his 21-year-old sister said 'I do' in July.</p>

      <p>Proud Robert told <a href="https://people.com/">PEOPLE</a>: "I was just so so stoked.</p>
      <p>"I was so excited and really honoured for her to ask me to walk her down the aisle.</p>
      <p>"I think it's going to be such a wonderful day, such a great celebration.</p>
      <p>"Chandler is absolutely perfect. I can’t fault him, he’s awesome."</p>

      <p>Bindi has previously said to Entertainment Tonight: "It’ll be really important that Robert walks me down the aisle.</p>
      <p>"I’m always so grateful that Robert is there, and he has been such a big part of my life and he’s always stepped up and been the one to give me a hug when I need it and encourage me forward in life.</p>
      <p>"So he will definitely be the one to walk me down the aisle when the time comes, and I think that will make it really special."</p>

      <p>The comments come as Steve Irwin's sister revealed last month that the Irwin family don't speak 13 years after the Crocodile Hunter's death.</p>
      <p>Joy told Daily Mail Australia that Steve's wife Terri and their children, Robert and Bindi, estranged themselves after his tragic death.</p>
      <p>The animal expert's father Bob Irwin is also said to have become a recluse since his son was killed in 2006.</p>
