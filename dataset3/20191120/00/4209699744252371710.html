      <p>A self-acclaimed pastor,  Sunday Egbo, has confessed to raping a member of his church, who refused to have sexual intercourse with him. </p>
      <p>The man made the confession while being paraded by the Enugu State Police Command on Tuesday. </p>
      <p>The police said a coffin and multiple female pants were recovered from Egbo’s house.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the victim had gone for prayers, during which the pastor forcefully had carnal knowledge of her.</p>
      <p>According to the state’s Commissioner of Police, the pastor took the woman to his room, brought out a magic stone and threatened to kill her if she raised the alarm.</p>
      <p>He further stated that after the rape, he seized her pant; brazier and brought a small bottle and wanted to insert it into her private part but she struggled and ran out naked.</p>
      <p>Egbo said, “I wanted to have sex with her but she refused. So, I raped her.</p>
      <p>“I paid a native doctor N200,000, to get the coffin and flute.</p>
      <p>"He told me to do certain things, after which I will get a Ghana-must-go bag full of money in my room.</p>
      <p>“But after two weeks, the money did not come as the native doctor told me.</p>
      <p>“I believe I was deceived. So, I’m advising other men of God to follow the ways of God. There is no need seeking power and favour in the wrong ways.</p>
      <p>“I also advise Nigerians to be mindful of the places they go for prayers.” </p>
