      <p>Google South Africa and Think WiFi plan to grow their free Wi-Fi initiative to encompass the entire country, giving more people fast and free access to the Internet.</p>
      <p>Earlier in November, the companies <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadband/326663-google-launches-free-wi-fi-for-the-cape-flats.html"><b>announced</b></a> the roll-out of free Wi-Fi access to residents in underserved areas in the Western Cape.</p>
      <p>These areas include Khayelitsha, Gugulethu, Langa, Delft, Elsies River, Kraaifontein, and Philippi.</p>
      <p>Google Africa director Nitin Garija said that the campaign hopes to uplift people in these areas with freely available internet.</p>
      <p>“By gaining access to information via the internet, we hope that people in these communities will get a more equal opportunity to learn and develop, and live more empowered lives,” Garija said.</p>
      <h3>Expanded Wi-Fi access</h3>
      <p>In an additional statement issued on 20 November, Think WiFi indicated that it intends to “expand the existing footprint to provide free Wi-Fi wherever there are people across South Africa”.</p>
      <p>“This means that Think WiFi could roll out in your community sooner than you think, even if you’re living in Constantia,” Think WiFi said.</p>
      <p>Think WiFi added that the company is currently involved in talks to provide free Wi-Fi to various locations.</p>
      <p>“Through our partnership, Think WiFi and Google will provide unlimited Wi-Fi access to communities in townships, public areas, universities, transportation hubs and shopping malls,” said Think WiFi CEO Janine Rebelo.</p>
