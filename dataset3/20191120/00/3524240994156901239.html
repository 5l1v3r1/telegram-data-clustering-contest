      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered federal institutions across the country to construct sanitation facilities such as public toilets in strategic locations to end open defecation in the country.</p>
      <p>He also charged states to do same, adding that households must be mobilised to provide their own sanitation facilities.</p>
      <p>Buhari said this in Abuja on Tuesday at the inauguration of the ‘Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet Campaign.’</p>
      <p>Represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the President stated that the Federal Government was committed to putting an end to open defecation.</p>
      <p>According to him, a World Bank report on the  economic impact of poor sanitation due to use of unhygienic or shared toilets and open defecation, estimated that Nigeria loses N455bn annually, with open defecation accounting for one third of this amount.</p>
      <p>Buhari said, “These costs include healthcare, loss of productivity, premature deaths and poor educational outcomes.”</p>
      <p>He noted that some of the dire costs of open defecation were those that could not be quantified in monetary terms.</p>
      <p>These, he said, included the social costs, loss of dignity, lack of privacy and increased vulnerability to physical attacks.</p>
      <p>On his part, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, said about 47 million Nigerians were still practising open defecation due to lack of facilities and space to use for defecation.</p>
      <p>In a related development, the Senate has also directed relevant Federal Government’s agencies to increase the number of public toilets in all the 36 states of the federation.</p>
      <p> The red chamber said the facilities should be provided in states where open defecation was more prevalent.</p>
      <p> The red chamber also urged the Ministry of the Environment, Water Resources, Health and other related agencies to increase awareness and sensitisation on the dangers of open defecation.</p>
      <p> The Senate took the decision after a debate on a motion by Senator Clifford Ordia on the “World Toilet Day,” an annual global event.</p>
      <p>Ordia emphasised the importance of expanding sanitation access to more than 4.2 billion people living without safely-managed sanitation options.</p>
      <p> He added that World Toilet Day was about inspiring action that would combat the global sanitation crisis.</p>
      <p>The senator said open defecation posed serious economic, social and health hazards to the people, community and the environment.</p>
      <p>Ordia said, “An expert in water, sanitation and hygiene who works with the United Nations Children Fund, Mr Bioye Ogunjobi, said Nigeria loses about 1.3 per cent of its GDP amounting to N455bn annually to poor sanitation. A third of that cost is as a result of the practice of open defecation.</p>
      <p>“If effective solutions are not found, the  non-availability of sanitation facilities inadvertently further exposes women and girls to violence including rape, when they are forced to go out at night to defecate in the open.”</p>
