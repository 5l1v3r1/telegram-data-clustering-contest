      <p>Scientists have melded nature’s two fundamental programming molecules — DNA and peptides — into one versatile structure that can store molecular blueprints and identify specific chemical structures.</p>
      <p>To encode genetic information, living things rely on DNA molecules, which are made of a precisely arranged sequence of building blocks called nucleotides. Each sequence binds to only a complementary strand of DNA, giving DNA the ability to recognize other molecules.</p>
      <p>Similarly, proteins and their constituent peptides are built from an alphabet of 21 amino acids. Amino-acid sequences carry instructions for how a molecule should be built and what its function is.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Heemstra and her colleagues at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, combined those two programming languages in a single molecule. They built a protein scaffold and attached nucleotide fragments and amino acids to this backbone, resulting in a ‘bilingual’ molecule that includes a protein code and a sequence of either DNA or RNA, another code-carrying molecule. On the basis of those codes, the molecules can then assemble into desired structures.</p>
      <p>If a specific DNA sequence is added, the molecule’s own nucleotide code binds to that sequence, and the structure falls apart.</p>
