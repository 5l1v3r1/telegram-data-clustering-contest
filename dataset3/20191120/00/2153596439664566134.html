      <h1>Eskom’s white CEO appointment angers unions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/bloomberg/" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>The South African government’s selection of a white executive to head the state power utility has outraged some unionists and politicians who see the move as a setback to efforts to address the nation’s racial disparities.</p>
      <p>Andre de Ruyter, 51, is due to become chief executive officer of debt-stricken Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd on Jan. 15 and will be the first white person to be assigned the post on a permanent basis since Allen Morgan retired in early 2001.</p>
      <p>Jacob Maroga, who was Eskom CEO from 2007 to 2009, and Dan Marokane, the utility’s former head of group capital, were among the black contenders.</p>
      <p>The National Union of Mineworkers and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, the two largest unions at Eskom, criticized De Ruyter’s appointment as a setback to the country’s racial-transformation agenda.</p>
      <p>And the radical Economic Freedom Fighters, the second-largest opposition party, said the decision was racist and a deliberate attempt to diminish the role Africans play in the economy.</p>
      <p>The criticism is unfounded, according to Ntsikelelo Breakfast, a political analyst at the University of Stellenbosch.</p>
      <p>“There have been many black people who have had that position at Eskom before. Some have resigned and some have been implicated in serious transgressions,” he said Tuesday by phone.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think that the government or the board have turned a blind eye to transformation as far as Eskom is concerned.”</p>
      <p>While official data shows that white people do dominate the leadership of South African companies, that isn’t the case at state entities.</p>
      <p>The government’s Commission for Employment Equity assessed more than 26,000 companies last year and found almost 70% of top managers were white. By contrast, black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population of 58.8 million, occupied 76% of top government positions.</p>
      <p>Eskom provides about 95% of South Africa’s electricity. It’s amassed R450 billion ($30 billion) of debt that it can’t afford to service, is reliant on government bailouts to remain solvent and is battling to produce enough power to meet demand.</p>
      <p>De Ruyter, who holds a law degree and a masters’ degree in business administration, has considerable corporate experience, though not at state-owned companies.</p>
      <p>He’s been CEO of packaging firm Nampak Ltd since 2014 and prior to that worked for more than two decades at petrochemical giant Sasol Ltd, where he held a number of senior management roles.</p>
      <p>The Public Enterprises Ministry, which oversees Eskom, said it employed a recruitment company that identified 142 potential candidates to fill the CEO post and it drew up a shortlist of 17 people. The utility’s board interviewed six of them, and submitted three names to the cabinet, which made the final decision.</p>
      <p>Lobby groups Business Unity South Africa and the Black Business Council both said De Ruyter was appointed after a thorough process and they were committed to working with him.</p>
      <p>“Inasmuch as the country’s transformational agenda should be supported, critical positions should be filled based on merit,” said Sethulego Matebesi, a political analyst at the University of the Free State.</p>
      <p>“We should avoid turning every issue into a political hot potato. Does the new Eskom CEO has the requisite experience and skills? If so, let us support him irrespective of his color.”</p>
