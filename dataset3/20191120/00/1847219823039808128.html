        <b>Swedish investigators have decided to end investigation into Julian Assange, the whistle-blower organisation Wikileaks, over alleged rape that has been upheld since 2010.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British public broadcaster BBC reports, Deputy Director of Sweden’s Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson explained on Tuesday, November 20:</p>
      <p>«I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation».</p>
      <h3>Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012.</h3>
      <p>The 48-year-old Australian was evicted in April and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions.</p>
      <p>He is currently being held at a prison in London and separately, the U.S. is seeking Assange’s extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010.</p>
