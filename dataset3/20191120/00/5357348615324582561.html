      <h1>Accused in $400-m fraud case worth $255 million, says expert</h1>

        <b>THE financial net worth of Sanjay Elliott, the main accused in the Manchester Municipal Corporation $400-million fraud case, has been estimated by an expert witness in finance to be in the region of $255 million at the time of his arrest in 2016.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The witness, Desmond Robinson, acting senior financial forensic examiner at the Financial Investigation Division (FID), told the court in Porus yesterday that Elliott, the municipal corporation's former deputy superintendent in charge of road and works, earned income that amounted to less than $15 million between 2008 and 2016.</p>
      <p>The witness, in a previous testimony on November 8, said that Elliott, three family members and an employee, who are among eight individuals facing the court on charges related to the multimillion dollar fraud case, were “targets” of his investigations.</p>
      <p>These so-called “targets” are Elliot's wife Tasha Gay, his parents Edwardo and Myrtle, and former employee Dwayne Sibblies.</p>
      <p>Robinson had told the court on November 8 that he investigated the financial transaction history of his targets, dating back from 2007 and up to 2016.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, during examination by prosecutor Channa Ormsby, Robinson said that the assets he identified during his investigations were in Elliott's name and those of his immediate family. He said the estimate also took into account six motor vehicles owned by Elliott.</p>
      <p>The witness also said Elliott had two loans amounting to $7 million that were outstanding.</p>
      <p>Four of the five defence attorneys representing the eight accused raised objections related to the admittance of the witness's report into evidence. One of the main objections was a long-standing issue of disclosure of documents to the defence by the prosecution. The defence claimed that documents that supported the FID representative's disclosure of Elliott's financial standing had not been made available to them.</p>
      <p>Presiding Judge Ann Marie Grainger said some of the issues raised by the defence may be aired during the defence counsel's cross-examination of the witness, but with respect to the non-disclosure claim by the attorneys, the judge instructed the prosecution to provide answers when the court resumes in Porus today at 11:30 am.</p>
