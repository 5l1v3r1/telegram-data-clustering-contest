      <p>The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has alleged that Nigeria’s Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, is working against his diplomatic mission for the restoration of Biafra.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the IPOB leader made this allegation in his recent live broadcast on Radio Biafra.</p>
      <p>Kanu alleged that the Nigerian Vice President offered to pay a “Consultancy Firm working for IPOB for the Restoration Of Biafra” the sum of $2 million monthly to halt their services.</p>
      <p>This, Kanu said, happened less than 24-hours after his meeting with some diplomats in Washington DC, the United States of America (USA).</p>
      <p>Naija News recalls that Kanu met some diplomats in the United States, where he discussed the actualization for the Republic of Biafra.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the meeting and what happened after it, Kanu who refused to mention the Consultancy Firm working for IPOB, accused Osinbajo of trying to induce the firm to dump their contract with the secessionist group.</p>
      <p>Kanu said: “Vice President Yemi Osinbajo moved to bribe a Consultancy Firm working for IPOB for the Restoration Of Biafra. Yemi Osibanjo promised to pay them 2million dollars a month to stop working for IPOB,” the IPOB leader alleged.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Naija News reports that Nnamdi Kanu is leading a group (IPOB) seeking secession from Nigeria. The group has since been banned by the Federal Government of Nigeria led by President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
