      <p>Get your claws out. The new trailer for “Cats” has dropped.</p>
      <p>The last trailer resolutely broke the internet with the first look at director Tom Hooper’s CGI creations, which morphed the live-action musical’s stars into human and cat hybrids complete with fur, tails, pointy ears and yet fully recognizable human faces. The <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/cats-trailer-reactions-internet-sonic/">memes were plentiful</a>, and not all of them kind.</p>
      <p>How will audiences react to this latest look? This one gives a deeper insight into the plot of the film adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical.</p>
      <p>“Tonight is a magical night where I choose the cat that deserves a new life,” Judi Dench’s character says in the new trailer. “Watch out for the crazy cat lady,” Rebel Wilson’s character adds.</p>

      <p>The story involves a tribe of cats called the Jellicles, who unite every year and decide which cat should be elevated to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life. Webber based the musical on a story by T.S. Eliot in his book “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats,” and the play first premiered in 1981 at the New London Theatre in the UK.</p>
      <p>“Les Miserables” director Hooper, who also wrote the screenplay with Lee Hall, directs a cast that stars Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, James Corden, Taylor Swift, Ray Winstone, Jennifer Hudson and Jason Derulo.</p>
      <p>Universal is releasing “Cats” on Dec. 20, 2019. Watch the new trailer above.</p>

That's called a 'triple threat' in showbiz.<cite>Universal Pictures</cite></figcaption>
