      <p>Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta wished former manager Jose Mourinho all the best as Tottenham head coach.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed by Spurs on Wednesday, a day after the Premier League club – who are 14th in the table – sacked Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese tactician led Chelsea to three league titles across two spells at the helm, but will now look to salvage their rivals' season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho may have joined Chelsea's rivals, but Azpilicueta – who won one of his two Premier League titles under the 56-year-old – sent well wishes.</p>
      <p>"I can talk only when Jose was here at Chelsea with us," he told Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p>"We won trophies, and now football moves on. I wish him all the best even though he goes to a rival.</p>
      <p>"I have good memories with him and I have played many times under him and against him.</p>
      <p>"Obviously when we play against each other we both want to win for our teams, but this is football. I wish him well."</p>
      <p>Mourinho's first game in charge of Spurs will come against another London club, West Ham, on Saturday.</p>
