      <p><b>Reactive vs Proactive</b><br/><b>Who are You?</b><br/><br/>There is nothing I can do….OR….I wonder what an alternative might be<br/><br/>They will not allow that….OR….I wonder what different approach <br/><br/>I can takeI must do that….OR….I choose to do this<br/><br/>If only I could….OR…I will</p>
      <p>Covey published <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> in 1989. This book continues to be a best seller along with several of his other publications.  Following <i>7 Habits</i> in 2000 he published <i>Living the 7 Habits: Applications and Insights</i>.  Below is a table summarizing Covey’s principles.  Consider how you might apply his “habits” to move yourself from the reactive to the proactive approach to the opening scenarios.</p>

      <p>Summarizing the above when addressing the options in the opening scenarios Covey is saying “play the ball before it plays you”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Personal well-being can fit into both categories…</i>
        </b>
        <br/>
        <b>
          <i>proactive and reactive.</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Avoiding a healthy lifestyle focused on integrating wellness and lifelong learning does not consider the long-term goal (Covey’s 2nd principle).  We would all agree that daily exercise and a healthy diet has positive benefits for body, mind, and spirit.  The key is…are we proactive or reactive to achieve that goal? Personal well-being is an ongoing process which is dynamic and progressive.  Optimal well-being relies on your choices (proactive) rather than luck (reactive).</p>
      <p><b>More examples of proactive approach to well-being include:</b><br/><br/>**Drinking plenty of water help lubricate joints, boosts skin health, aids in accessibility of minerals and nutrients to the body.<br/><br/>**Chiropractic adjustments aid in alignment of the spine for good posture, affects central nervous system, improves joint mobility, improves circulation.<br/><br/>**Viewing wellness (body, mind, and spirit) as part of your planned self-care.<br/><br/>Review the <a href="https://www.bloomstoblossoms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/WellnessContent.pdf">wellness resource</a> to apply Covey’s 7th principle (reflection) to determine if your personal well-being is on track.  <br/><br/><b>Consider how you would respond to each question in the following ways:</b><br/><br/>**What is my status/condition?<br/>**Is this factor important to me and if so, how does it fit into a priority list?<br/>**How can I be more proactive to achieve my wellness goals?</p>

      <p>In 2004, Covey published <i>The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness</i>.  The 8th habit is <b>“Find your voice and inspire others to find theirs.”</b> </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling.” </i>
        <br/>
        <i>–Stephen Covey</i>
      </p>
      <p>Learning to be more proactive about your wellness along with active engagement in your overall well-being is an ongoing lifelong learning process – there are always actions to take.  Remember, being proactive in your lifelong wellness is a skill you can develop and train. </p>
