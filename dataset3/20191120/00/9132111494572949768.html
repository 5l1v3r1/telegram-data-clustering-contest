      <p>The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has released provisional results of private candidates who sat for the 2019 West African Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE).</p>
      <p>Per a release issued by WAEC, some 102, 278 candidates comprising of 51, 935 males and 55, 488 females registered for the exams.</p>
      <p>Out of the total number, 5, 145 absentees were recorded.</p>
      <p>Results of some 753 candidates have been withheld for allegedly engaging in various forms of examination malpractices, one of which is bringing mobile phones into the exams hall.</p>
      <p>According to the examination body, these withheld results will be released or cancelled after the Council completes investigations into the alleged malpractices.</p>
      <p>The WAEC cautioned the general public to be wary of persons who pose as representatives of the Council with the capability of changing or upgrading results at a fee.</p>
      <p>“We wish to assure all stakeholders that the Council’s results database is well secured, as such all forged results can be detected by the confirmation/verification system which has been made available to institutions and organizations,” the Council stated.</p>
      <p>Various institutions and organizations are therefore advised to access the confirmation or verification service online through the Council’s website.</p>
