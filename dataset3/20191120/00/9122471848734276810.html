      <h1>The College Football Playoff Rankings After Week 12 Have Been Released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:11:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The first College Football Playoffs rankings of the 2019 season were two weeks ago. Heading into the release of the initial rankings, Ohio State and LSU battled for the top spot. Two weeks later, both are still vying for the top spot, but only one can win – for now.</p>
      <p>In the first playoff rankings, Ohio State held the top spot. However, LSU took over last week after taking down the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Tigers have taken control of the playoff race, but could see themselves knocked out of the top spot soon.</p>
      <p>A huge game between Ohio State and Penn State could bump the Buckeyes up to No. 1 next week.</p>
      <p>For now, though, head coach Ryan Day and company will have to be okay sitting in second.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full list:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
