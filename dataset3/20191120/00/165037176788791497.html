        <b>Jamie O'Hara has backed former club Tottenham's decision to replace Mauricio Pochettino with perennial title winner Jose Mourinho.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Jose Mourinho</b> is replacing <b>Mauricio Pochettino</b> as Tottenham head coach at the '<b>perfect time</b>', according to former midfielder <b>Jamie O'Hara.</b></p>
      <p>Ex-Manchester United boss Mourinho was appointed by <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham </a>on Wednesday, around 12 hours on from Pochettino's five-and-a-half-year tenure being brought to an end.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian was sacked on the back of a <b>poor run of form</b> that has left the club 14th in the Premier League, which O'Hara believes is an <b>indication that change was needed</b>.</p>
      <p>"I think it was the right time to go," he told Omnisport. "We've been struggling, the form hasn't been great. I think we've got 24 points from 25 games. <b>We've not been good in the league</b>. The form hasn't been good. The Champions League final overshadowed a lot last season in terms of the way we were playing. <b>I think they just looked at it and thought it's time to move on.</b>"</p>

      <p>"The squad wasn't getting the reaction you'd normally get and it was one of those moments where you thought, <b>you've taken us as far as you can and now let's move on.</b>"</p>
      <p>Pochettino guided Tottenham to four consecutive top-four finishes in the Premier League and reached the Champions League final in June, <b>where they lost 2-0 to Liverpool</b>.</p>
      <p>However, the 47-year-old - <b>tipped to take over at Bayern Munich</b> - did not win any silverware during his time in north London and O'Hara thinks that will change under his successor.</p>

      <p>"Poch is going to go on to a massive job. He's not going to be out of work for long," said O'Hara, who spent eight years on Tottenham's books before leaving in 2011. </p>
      <p>"He's had a good pay-off, he's had a fantastic time here, his stock is high, <b>he will go to another massive football club.</b></p>
      <p>"There's no-one better in the world at winning trophies than Jose Mourinho. If you talked five years ago about Mourinho coming to Spurs, you probably would have laughed at us because <b>we would never have been able to attract a manager like that. </b></p>

      <p>"To be able to attract a manager that's won everything in the game is an <b>incredible feat. </b>To get him over the line, it's the perfect time for him to take over, the club will kick on now, we'll move on, he'll bring his own stamp in and I think you're going to <b>see Spurs competing for trophies very, very soon.</b>"</p>
      <p>Mourinho, a <b>three-time Premier League title winner with Chelsea</b>, had been out of work for 11 months since being axed by United.</p>
      <p>O'Hara is confident the Portuguese will be financially backed by chairman <b>Daniel Levy</b> and expects Tottenham's defence to be completely rejuvenated in the coming months.</p>
      <p>"I think he'll have money, for sure. I think he definitely wouldn't have taken this job if there wasn't a good budget," O'Hara added.</p>
      <p>"I think he's got a good squad now where he can galvanise the squad to try and get us up the table. Once January comes, I think you'll be looking at a whole new back four. I think he's going to bring in a left-back, a right-back and a centre-half. Mourinho's teams, when they've won trophies and dominated, had the best back four you could ever ask for, and I think that's now where he's going to put all his money."</p>
