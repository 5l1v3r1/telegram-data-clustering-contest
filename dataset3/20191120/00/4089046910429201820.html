      <p>Investigators said the young attackers stormed the Snapfinger Elementary School bus when it stopped along a street in DeKalb County on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>On Monday afternoon, the school district sent a voicemail to parents that said in part: “During the morning ride to school, a group of middle and high school students boarded the bus to assault an elementary student."</p>
      <p>The school district also said more than one student was attacked. One student was injured so seriously that the child was taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Police arrested an 18-year-old non-student, a high school student and two middle school students on assault charges.</p>
