      <h1>Rey Finds Darth Vader’s Mask in a New Rise of Skywalker TV Spot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:29:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>One month from tomorrow, Rey’s journey will finally come to an end in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b></a>. Previous footage has hinted that the character might be headed down a dark path in the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga. Now, a new TV spot for the film shows her staring darkness in the face.</p>
      <p>The spot confirms there will be a scene in <b>The Rise of Skywalker</b> where Rey stumbles across the remains of Darth Vader’s helmet. You can watch it for yourself via <a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1196842344961544198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196842344961544198&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fheroichollywood.com%2Fstar-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-darth-vader%2F">Twitter</a> below.</p>

      <p>Moviegoers last saw Vader’s charred mask onscreen in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-force-awakens"><b>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</b></a>. Kylo Ren was seen speaking to it onboard his ship, begging the fallen Sith Lord to once again show him “the power of the darkness.” In life, Vader was Kylo’s grandfather, Anakin Skywalker. And even though Anakin relinquished his connection to the Dark Side in <b>Return of the Jedi</b>, Kylo nevertheless promised to “finish what [he] started.”</p>
      <p>It’s not clear what role the helmet will play in <b>The Rise of Skywalker</b>. However, it’s worth noting that Kylo tends to speak to it when he feels the light side pulling him back. The final trailer also notably featured a shot of him and Rey destroying the helmet with their lightsabers. Perhaps this marks the first step toward Ben Solo’s redemption.</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b> opens in theaters on December 20.</p>
