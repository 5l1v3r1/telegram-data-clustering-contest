        <b>Pelicans 115 (5-9), Blazers 104 (5-10)</b>
      </p>
      <p>HE’S BACK.</p>
      <p>Carmelo Anthony made his debut for the Blazers, his first appearance in an NBA game in 376 days. Melo shook some of the rust off and finished with 10 points and 4 rebounds in 24 minutes. The Pelicans spoiled his return by coming away with the win, but hoop fans everywhere should be nothing but thrilled that Melo is playing NBA basketball again.</p>
      <p>Jrue Holiday led New Orleans with 22 points and 10 assists, and Brandon Ingram added 21 points, 7 boards, and 5 assists. CJ McCollum dropped 22 in the loss.</p>

LBJ’s 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists against the Thunder made him the first player ever to record a triple-double against every team in the NBA, an insane accomplishment for The King.</p>
