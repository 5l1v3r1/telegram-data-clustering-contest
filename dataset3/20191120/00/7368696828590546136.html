      <h1>Half-Life: Alyx Story and Gameplay Details Revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Marco Cocomello</a></address>
      <p>On Monday we <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/half-life-alyx-officially-confirmed-valve-will-reveal-it-this-week/">reported</a> on a new Half-Life game in development at Valve called Half-Life: Alyx. No, it is not Half-Life 3 but we are making progress at least. While very little is known about the game as the full reveal is meant to take place later this week, a new report has emerged detailing what the gameplay mechanics and setting could be for this upcoming VR title.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/half-life-alyx-what-we-know-about-valves-upcoming-full-length-vr-game/">Ars Technica</a>, Half-Life: Alyx is a prequel VR game that takes place between Half-life and Half-Life 2. The game will put players in the shoes of Alyx Vance we all know as Gordon Freeman’s partner and the character introduced in the second game.</p>
      <p>The game will incorporate many mechanics from previous titles including the “gravity” feature. Instead of using the gun, players will make use of a new device called the “Grabbity Gloves” that will act like magnetic gloves allowing players to attract faraway objects and interact with the environment.</p>
      <p>The report claims Valve is working hard to harness the power of the Valve Index “knuckles” controllers by making almost every object in the game interactive. The report also states Half-Life: Alyx will not feature the crowbar as a usable weapon due to motion limits. This is unconfirmed though.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the report details the game will run on the Source 2 Engine which is the successor to the engine that powered the original games, as well as Portal. Half-Life: Alyx has been in development for a couple of years already and is one of three VR games currently in development at Valve.</p>
      <p>We will share more about the game later this week when the full reveal takes place. Valve will be showcasing the game this Thursday.</p>
