      <h1>Rebel Wilson Has Written a Comedy Called <i>Seoul Girls</i> About An Aspiring K-Pop Star</h1>

      <p>Here’s some news you surely considered only a matter of time. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/rebel-wilson-sorry-for-blocking-black-critics-on-twitter.html">Rebel Wilson</a> has written a comedy feature called <i>Seoul Girls </i>about an aspiring <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/bts-black-pink-and-the-continued-success-of-k-pop.html">K-pop</a> star, and Lionsgate has snatched it up. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/lionsgate-rebel-wilson-k-pop-comedy-seoul-girls-1202790233/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, the story will follow “a Korean American high school girl and her friends who enter a worldwide talent competition to be the opening act for the world’s biggest <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/review-bts-blackpink-albums-mark-unprecedented-k-pop-moment.html">K-pop</a> boy band.” The report also says the pop star hopefuls “help from an ex-member of a British girl group and a former <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/a-deeper-look-at-why-bts-has-thrived-in-america.html">K-pop</a> trainee,” and Wilson will be taking a role in the movie, but she is not explicitly described as playing that “former K-pop trainee” role. A recent script revision for <i>Seoul </i>was apparently handled by <i>Billions </i>writer Young Il Kim. So, just take all that in.</p>
