      <h1>College Football Picks: Scoreboard watching for CFP hopefuls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">RALPH D. RUSSO</a></address>
      <p>Pac-12 powers No. 6 Oregon and No. 7 Utah are on the road this weekend, trying to continue their march to a mega-meeting with huge playoff ramifications in the conference championship game next month.</p>
      <p>They should also both be keeping an eye on the Big 12, where No. 8 Oklahoma is looming. And, of course, the Ducks, Utes, Sooners and other playoff hopefuls will be scoreboard watching the Southeastern Conference to see if No. 4 Georgia stumbles against Texas A&amp;M.;</p>
      <p>Big 12 fans rooting for the Aggies?</p>
      <p>The whole point of the College Football Playoff was to connect the country and get fans interested in games involving teams from outside their regions. Who knows how many Sooners fans will have the Ducks’ game against Arizona State and the Utes’ meeting with Arizona on a second (or third) screen Saturday night, but the CFP has at least provided the motivation.</p>
      <p>The Ducks (No. 6 CFP) and Utes (No. 7 CFP) are both more than two-touchdown favorites Saturday night. Same goes for the Sooners (No. 8 CFP) at home against TCU. No. 13 Baylor (No. 14 CFP) is still in the mix in the Big 12, too. The Bears host Texas in what looks like the most competitive game involving Pac-12/Big 12 contenders.</p>
