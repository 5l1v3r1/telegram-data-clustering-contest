      <h1>Natural Wine 101 And Why You Should Serve It At Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jeanne O'Brien Coffey</a></address>
      <p>Every year, I try to come up with a new angle on the old trope of what to serve with your turkey dinner. I’ve suggested <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanneobriencoffey/2015/11/30/rose-your-new-go-to-holiday-wine/#5ee68e7c5315">rosé</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanneobriencoffey/2017/11/20/surprise-guests-with-sauternes-at-thanksgiving-dinner/#3037cee43cc3">Sauternes</a>, both of which are still terrific choices, but this year, I’m loving natural wines. Generally speaking, they are crafted to be food-friendly, and you can find a decent selection of dry wines with lower alcohol content than some of the big producers. Not to mention that pretty much every natural wine comes with a story of a producer who loves land and wine and is creating something unique – a great way to steer your dinner conversation away from politics.</p>

      <p>“The people that like natural wine follow the story of the farmers that made it, the vibrant flavors and aromas of wine not made with chemicals, and the often lighthearted and fun labels that go with it,” says Matt Mollo, who runs <a href="http://www.selectionaturel.com/">SelectioNaturel</a>, an importer of natural wines. “Labels are not to be underestimated!”</p>
      <p>Indeed, I was attracted first to the label on <a href="http://www.selectionaturel.com/tenuta-macchiarola">Tenuta Macchiarola’s Tippi</a>— a cartoon drawing of a pair of legs in a short skirt with red high heels— before realizing that it is a perfect wine to bring to Thanksgiving dinner. This spontaneously fermented primitivo rosé from Puligia, is only 10 percent alcohol and bone dry. That’s right. It’s 10 percent alcohol and it is not sweet. Lightly frizzante, a little fruity, a little bit sour, this will carry you from aperitif through your main course. Maybe dessert, if it involves cranberries.</p>
      <p>It’s a bit funky, so have an open mind when you enjoy it. Luckily, more and more consumers are expanding their palates. “I think natural wine has captivated a younger, more adventurous drinking audience, one not obsessed with points ratings or fancy reviews that were so popular in the 80s and 90s,” Mollo says.</p>
      <p>I asked Jared Brandt, winemaker/proprietor of <a href="https://www.donkeyandgoat.com/">Donkey &amp; Goat Winery</a>, which has been producing natural wines in California for 15 years, and SelectioNaturel’s Mollo, to explain the basics and offer some advice for choosing some this year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why do you think there is an uptick in interest in natural wines?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I think people are very interested in have authentic products that are made with natural ingredients - knowing who makes your product or at least their story has become important to many consumers,” Brandt says. “At the same time, the craft beer movement has opened up many drinkers to non-traditional ideas.”</p>
      <p>Adds Mollo: “I think the general rise of the movement comes from a consumer that is more aware and concerned about the origin of the products they consume, especially what they eat and put into their body.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are some surprising things that can be added to conventional wines?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The most common additives include selected yeasts and sulfur dioxide,” Mollo says. “[But] the litany of other commercial additives are what really can be the hidden and misunderstood chemicals found in conventional wines. These things range from Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to a substance called MegaPurple, used to add dark red/purple color to wine…You're spending tons of money at the high-end grocery store or farmers market, making amazing food and yet the wine you're drinking with it is an industrial product...the equivalent of Foxy Lettuce (or worse).”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s the deal with sulfites?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“This gets a lot of people's attention because the words "contains sulfites" appear on most every bottle of wine in the U.S.,” Mollo says. “In reality SO2 can be used sparingly and to good effect in tiny quantities even in what I would consider natural wine.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is natural wine a good place to look for people interested in consuming low-proof drinks?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Naturally made wines tend to be– but do not have to be –lower in alcohol,” says Mollo. “This is largely because wines made with little or no additives rely on natural acidity from the grapes to keep the wines stable. Producers tend to harvest the grapes a bit earlier in general with natural winemaking and the resulting wines are also easier to drink, leave you less groggy and overall add to a more positive experience of drinking wine.”</p>

      <p>
        <b> Is there a lot of vintage variation with natural wine?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“With natural wine, the producer is at the mercy of nature and they have to be very wise and pragmatic with farming practices and vinification techniques...often they must change and adapt every year in some way,” Mollo says. “When you're making conventional wine, using hundreds of the aforementioned additives, you can make your wine taste the same every year, good or bad, hot or cold...that's literally the point of conventional wine.”</p>
      <p>Brandt agrees.  “I think of this as a function of someone who respects terroir and vintage,” he says. “Classical Burgundian producers also experience vintage variation. That said, big commercial houses try to eliminate vintage variation, which is sad to me. I want to know what the year was.” </p>
      <p>
        <b> Since natural wines are primarily small production, and specific bottles may be hard to find, how can consumers find wines that they’ll like?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Even though natural wine has gained popularity, it is still a tiny, tiny, tiny drop in the bucket when it comes to overall wine production and what the general wine consuming public is drinking,” Mollo says. “When you walk into a big box liquor store and ask them for natural wine, they likely won't know what you mean and will point you in the direction of some very commercially made "organic" wine…. The key with sourcing natural wine is to find a retailer you can dialogue with. Generally they are smaller scale shops that focus on wine and products that share a similar ethos of quality. Talking with these type of retailers, asking questions and not being intimidated are all part of the natural wine world and I think that's what makes it so fun and enjoyable. Get to know who is selling you your bottle of wine, just like you would your baker with a loaf of fresh bread.”</p>
      <p>Seek out quality importers, adds Brandt. “<a href="http://www.jennyandfrancois.com/">Jenny &amp; Francois</a>, <a href="http://louisdressner.com/">Louis Dressner</a>, Mollo’s SelectioNatural, and <a href="http://www.josepastorselections.com/">Jose Pastor</a> are all great importers to look for.”  </p>

        <b>What will you be drinking for Thanksgiving?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brandt: I will be with friends in New York.  I expect we will start the evening with our <a href="https://www.donkeyandgoat.com/shop/detail?item=19-new-glou">New Glou</a> move to Champagne, enjoy some Beaujolais and end with Barolo. That said, I am super lucky since my friend has an incredible cellar and pallet to match” </p>
      <p>Mollo: “Honestly, Thanksgiving offers up such a smorgasbord of flavors, memories and emotions that I generally think anything goes. For me I tend to start with some light, gently sparkling wines, often called Frizzante in Italian or Pet-Nat's (short for petillant naturel), like the Tippi from Macchiarola. These open up the palate and are fun to drink with starters or through the meal. Beyond that I tend to open an array of different wines, some crisp aromatic white wines, say from Cellario in Piedmont or the Dolomite Alps of Italy. Light bodied, chillable red wines like Ciliegiolo from Umbria, Barbera from Piedmont, or even a juicy Primitivo from Puglia tend to be what my family and I love...We are Italian-Americans so, yes, there's a pasta course before the bird at our house! Keep it fun, keep it varied is what I tend to go for with Thanksgiving.”  </p>
