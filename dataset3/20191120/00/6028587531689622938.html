      <p>The U.K.’s top bicycle commuting city is Cambridge, with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-area-walking-and-cycling-in-england-2014-to-2015">43% of work journeys done by bicycle</a>. But, which of Britain’s major cities have the highest number of transportation cyclists per head of population? According to the exercise measuring app Strava, it’s not London.The U.K. capital may have the greatest number of daily cyclists, but per 1,000 citizens, London ranks behind Cardiff and Leeds.</p>
      <p>At the head of the bunch, says a new analysis, are Bristol, Newcastle, and Southampton. So says a November 20 statement from Strava, which has launched the third iteration of Metro, its transport infrastructure and planning tool based on its members’ exercise stats.</p>

      <p>Strava is the world’s largest sports participation app, with over 46 million sign-ups. The company claims that 7.5% of the U.K. population uses Strava.</p>
      <p>Metro was launched in 2014 and is sold to 300 cities globally to enable urban planners to analyze cycle commuting patterns and other forms of active transport. According to Strava, Bristol is England’s leading cycle commuter city out of those measured, with 29 cycle commuters per 1,000 head of population. Next is Newcastle, with 21 per 1,000. Third is Southampton, with 16.4 per 1,000.</p>
      <p>Manchester and Liverpool rank lowest amongst major cities, with 7.7 and 6.6 cycle commuters per 1,000, respectively.</p>
      <p>Strava’s Metro tool can be used to plot the most popular cycling commuter corridors, based on the volume of travel during commuting hours. There is a clear correlation between the amount invested in cycling infrastructure in urban environments and the concentration of cycling commuters within that city’s population, claims Strava.</p>

      <p>In Newcastle, Strava Metro’s heatmapping shows that the multi-use path across the city’s Town Moor—an urban lung—is among the most popular cycle commuting routes for locals.</p>
      <p>“Strava Metro has been instrumental in improving how we understand and plan for cycling in London,” said Louise Hall, analysis head at Transport for London.</p>
      <p>“We have used it to target our cycle-focused signal timing reviews, and it has also been used to quantify the impact of interventions and the shift towards sustainable modes of transport: it’s a unique dataset.”</p>
      <p>For Sue Jackson, group manager for transport strategy at Hertfordshire Council, Strava Metro is a problem-spotter:</p>
      <p>“Being able to see if cyclists are going out of their way to avoid particular roads, helps us understand where we need to improve our network and plan safety schemes that will make a real difference.”</p>

      <p>The Metro 3.0 platform displays metrics in an expanded dashboard, adding more visualization tools.</p>
      <p>When asked whether Strava data is representative of average cyclists rather than just performance-obsessed keenies, the company provided this boilerplate:</p>
      <p>“Several independent academic studies have analyzed the relationship between Metro data and data recorded by electronic or human bike counters and found robust correlations between the two.”</p>

      <p>The company adds: “Strava members’ travel patterns are representative of the overall population and also means that Metro partners who have collected additional count data from even a small number of fixed locations have the opportunity to combine the two data sources, generate adjustment factors, and produce very robust insights about the entire network.”</p>
      <p>The cities Strava Metro included in its analysis were Greater London, Greater Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Liverpool, Newcastle, Bristol, Cardiff Belfast, Southampton and Sheffield.</p>
