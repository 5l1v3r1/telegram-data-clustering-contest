        <b>On Wednesday, 20 November, Saeima’s Mandates, Ethics and Submissions Committee conceptually supported the legislative draft on the initiative signed by more than 11 000 residents in regards to the significant increase of funding for political parties and its submission to the parliament’s Budget Committee for review.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The committee’s chairperson Janīna Kursīte-Pakule told journalists that the committee made this decision to prevent the initiative’s review from being delayed and to ensure it is properly discussed by the responsible committee. The Mandates Committee did not try to formulate its position in this matter because it would require more than week-long discussions, said the politician.</p>
      <p>When asked if the coalition has any strict plans to support political parties funding increase and keep everything as is, making the initiative’s review by this Budget Committee pointless, Kursīte-Pakule she would not describe the assessment project in such a way.</p>
      <h3>The committee’s head said that before organizing a new discussion in «full size», she refrained from predicting if it is possible to reach some sort of compromise.</h3>
      <p>«Never say never,» said the politician, adding that the committee’s, the coalition’s and opposition’s representatives may return to this matter later and decide if it is possible to postpone plans for the increase of funding. The parliamentarian stressed that political factions may also discuss this matter in parallel to the parliament.</p>
      <p>The Saeima will still have to decide on submitting the matter to the Budget Committee for review.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, in spite of the fact residents’ signed initiative was submitted to the parliament at the end of October, the parliament ignored it when deciding on plans to increase funding for political parties and the state budget creation process.</p>
      <p><i>Manabalss.lv</i> public initiatives portal had previously explained the necessary number of signatures was collected within less than a week. On top of that, the support from residents towards this initiative was the second largest in the history of the platform.</p>

      <p>Authors of the initiative remind that Saeima’s agenda includes the legislative draft Amendments to the Law on Financing of Political Organizations. One of the main changes detailed therein is the significant increase of state budget support for political parties starting with 1 January 2020. While until now parties that overcame the 2% barrier in previous Saeima elections were paid EUR 0.71 per received vote, amendments will increase this amount to EUR 4.50 per vote. On top of that, parties that receive more than 5% of votes in previous elections will be paid an additional amount of EUR 100 000 from the state budget every year. To secure funding for this, it is planned to allocate EUR 4.5 million from the state budget.</p>
