      <p>Australian-listed Prospect Resources has found significant  reserves of lithium, a vital element in the manufacturing of electric batteries,  at its Arcadia mine just outside the capital Harare, its officials said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The company said the deposits represent a 39% increase on the ore reserves announced in December 2017.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe is pushing lithium as one of its key minerals to grow the economy in line with its plan to garner $12bn  from mining by 2023.</p>
      <p>The Arcadia project was a granted mining lease in August 2018 in an area that covers more than 1,000ha.</p>
      <p>The mineral-rich southern African country has vast lithium reserves, believed to be the largest in Africa and fifth largest in the world. But most remain unexplored due to low investment.</p>
      <p>Demand for lithium is growing in line with rising demand for electric vehicles as governments and industry players embrace the global campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Wednesday, Prospect Resources said the increase of the ore reserve confirmed Arcadia as the “seventh-largest global hard rock lithium asset”.</p>
      <p>Prospect MD Sam Hosack said: “This incredible result confirms Arcadia as a globally unique and significant lithium deposit to supply the glass and ceramics market with technical grade, ultra-low iron petalite.</p>
      <p>“We see the battery market as a key driver of lithium demand growth but remain focused on the glass and ceramics market where Arcadia seeks to become a significant, consistent and reliable high-quality supplier and access the premium prices available in this market.”</p>
      <p>The company said the upgraded ore reserve estimates at the project have increased the life of the mine beyond 15 years.</p>
      <p>It also said the mineral is close to the surface allowing for open-pit mining.  – Business Day</p>
