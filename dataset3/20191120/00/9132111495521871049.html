      <p>Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo, Chairman of the National Democratic Congress says come 2020, Ghanaians will vote massively for former president John Mahama as the next president of the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, Ghanaians do not recognise the NDC as just an opposition party but a government in waiting.</p>
      <p>"The work that we have done, and the impact on the ground Ghanaians are yearning for president John Dramani Mahama...In 2021, January 7, John Mahama will be sworn in as the next president of the Republic of Ghana."</p>
      <p>He said this Wednesday, November 20, 2019, in an interview with Osei Bonsu on 'Ekosii Sen' on Asempa FM, monitored by www.ghanaweb.com.</p>
      <p>When the host questioned him if the party had conducted scientific polls to ascertain that, he responded, "Yes we have done that, not one. We are approaching this election from the scientific point of view."</p>
      <p>He added that supporters of the NDC and Ghanaians at large have publicly shown their support to that effect by coming out in their numbers during Mahama's recent tours.</p>
      <p>"Our supporters and Ghanaians come out in their numbers to meet president John Dramani Mahama, the next president of the Republic of Ghana."</p>
      <p>Mr. Ofosu Ampofo continued that, the allegations that the NDC buses people to storm Mahama's campaign tours are false because the party does not have the resources.</p>
      <p>"I am saying that Ghaianns are looking at the NDC as the government in waiting. well, you can believe it or not, but that is the reality," he sent a message to the doubting Thomases.</p>
      <p>To the NDC Chairman, the party has done all the necessary assignments to aid them win the elections.</p>
      <p>"We have a united party. One of the ingredients for a successful campaign is unity at the front of the party, and we are all united."</p>
