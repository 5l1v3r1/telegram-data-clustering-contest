      <h1>Marshal law in Varthur from today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p>In compliance with the orders by National Green Tribunal, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will deploy 21 marshals at Varthur Lake on Wednesday. The launch was slated for Tuesday, but was later shifted to Wednesday. The marshals will inspect and prevent illegal activities in the buffer zone. <br/><br/>Col Rajbir Singh, chief marshal, says the 21 marshals will work exclusively for Vathur lake round-the-clock to keep a check on any anti-social activities and illegal dumping of construction and demolition debris at the lake. “The marshals will monitor the illegal dumping and prevent any encroachments in the lake area. They will book violators and ensure that the buffer zone is maintained well. The BBMP will comply with their part of the order. CCTV cameras and elevated towers will be installed at the lake,” he says adding that the aim is to preserve the lake after the weeding and desilting work is completed. <br/><br/><br/>The monitoring committee on Bellandur and Varthur Lakes led by Justice Santosh Hegde had submitted a report on September 20 on the measures taken for the rejuvenation of these lakes. The committee had pointed out that Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), BBMP and KSPCB (Karnataka State Pollution Control Board) have failed to implement the NGT directions.</p>

      <p>­–Col Rajbir Singh, chief marshal<br/><br/><br/>Recently, a meeting was held chaired by Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) to government EV Ramanna Reddy where the BBMP Commissioner had stated that marshals will be deployed immediately at Varthur lake. The ACS had instructed that the marshals be deployed immediately at the lake area and its buffer zone and rajakaluves be marked as per the SC order. The NGT order on 21 October had also stated about the removal of C&amp;D debris. All the agencies will now have to furnish their updated compliance report and action taken report by November 27 failing which they will have to appear before the Court.</p>
