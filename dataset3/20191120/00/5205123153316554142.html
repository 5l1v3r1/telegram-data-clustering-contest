      <p>Mauricio Pochettino out, Jose Mourinho in: Quite possibly the most bizarre managerial shake-up since Chelsea booted the new Spurs boss out in 2007 and replaced him with Avram Grant.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, change is in the air at White Hart Lane, and Pochettino might not be the only thing they lose.</p>
      <p>Republic of Ireland striker Troy Parrott has emerged as a surprise transfer for target for Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has been making waves in Tottenham's youth side, and made his Republic of Ireland debut against New Zealand last week, setting up the winner for Mick McCarthy's side in a 3-1 win.</p>

      <p>The German champions have been known to dip into the youth academies of English sides. They spent much of last season trying to pry Callum Hudson-Odoi away from Chelsea before the youngster signed an extension in the summer, and in 2011 they made the perplexing signing of Dale Jennings, after plucking him from Tranmere Rovers at the age of 19.</p>
      <p>Well it appears they're back it, eyeing up not just Parrott, but Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson, on loan from Manchester United, as a potential successor to Manuel Neuer.</p>
      <p>Transfer to the Bundesliga worked wonders for Jason Sancho, who left Manchester City in 2017 and instantly found his feet in Borussia Dortmund's side.</p>
      <p>News of Bayern's interest in Parrott came just hours after Pochettino's sacking on Tuesday night, and with the Argentine now linked with taking over at the Allianz Arena, it begs the question as to whether this is a move sanctioned by Poch himself - who was known to be monitoring the Irish youngster's progress closely.</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, this afternoon, Parrott was captured on Twitter 'liking' a post about how his chances of breaking into the first-time at Tottenham were over due to Mourinho - not exactly famed for putting faith in young players - taking over.</p>
