      <h1>Canadian dollar hits six-week low as U.S.-China tensions climb</h1>

      <p>The Canadian dollar weakened to a near six-week low against the greenback on Wednesday as investor sentiment soured on U.S.-China tensions, but the loonie clawed back some losses after domestic inflation data that was in line with expectations.</p>
      <p>At 9:19 a.m., the Canadian dollar was trading 0.1 per cent lower at 1.3285 to the greenback, or 75.27 U.S. cents. The currency touched its weakest intraday level since Oct. 10 at 1.3315.</p>
      <p>Canada’s annual inflation rate held steady in October at 1.9 per cent as expected, data from Statistics Canada showed, marking the third straight month of little change.</p>
      <p>“The external climate is of more concern (than inflation) for the loonie at the moment and Bank of Canada officials are doing a fantastic job of talking it (the currency) down,” said Simon Harvey, FX market analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the global economy is facing immense challenges that could spill over into Canada.</p>
      <p>Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz is due to speak on Thursday on economic change.</p>
      <p>World stocks were knocked off 22-month highs after the United States Senate unanimously passed legislation on Tuesday aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong amid a crackdown on a pro-democracy protest movement, drawing condemnation from Beijing.</p>
      <p>The tensions could make it more difficult for the United States and China to reach a trade deal. Canada is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so its economy could be hurt by prolonged trade uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Oil edged higher on Wednesday as Iran-related tensions escalated but receding hopes for a quick solution to the U.S.-China trade war dragged on prices. U.S. crude oil futures were up 1 per cent at $55.76 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Canadian government bond prices were higher across a flatter yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year rose 1 cent to yield 1.512 per cent and the 10-year was up 23 cents to yield 1.420 per cent.</p>
      <p>The 10-year yield touched its lowest intraday level since Oct. 10 at 1.394 per cent</p>
