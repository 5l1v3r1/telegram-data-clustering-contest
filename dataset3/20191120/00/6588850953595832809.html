      <p>A convicted internet fraudster has been placed under investigation in Nigeria for allegedly masterminding a "mega scam" from a maximum-security prison worth at least $1m (£773,000).</p>
      <p>Anti-corruption officials said Hope Olusegun Aroke used a "network of accomplices" for the fraud.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in 2012 and has been serving a 24-year sentence at the Kirikiri Maximum Security Prison.</p>
      <p>But a preliminary investigation found he still had access to the internet.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Tuesday, Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said it had received intelligence about Aroke's scam and was faced with the "riddle" of how he was able to "continue to ply his ignoble trade" from inside the Lagos prison.</p>
