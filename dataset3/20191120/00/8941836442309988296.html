      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - A U.S. aircraft carrier ordered by the White House to rapidly deploy to the Mideast over a perceived threat from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> has transited the Strait of Hormuz for the first time since its deployment.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Navy says the USS Abraham Lincoln transited the strait on Tuesday, making its way to the Persian Gulf. The carrier left Norfolk, VA, in April and was diverted to the Middle East in May, but it had remained in the Arabian Sea, avoiding passage through the strait that borders <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>.</p>
      <p>American aircraft carriers have for decades sailed through the international oil shipping route in what the U.S. describes as “defensive” operations aimed at keeping the strait open.</p>
