        <b> MLS newcomer Nashville SC have signed Ghanaian striker Abu Danladi from Minnesota United during Tuesday's MLS expansion draft.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Danladi, a former No. 1 overall draft pick, spent three seasons with the Loons.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old scored two goals and had two assists while starting four of 24 games he played this past season.</p>
      <p>Danladi played almost twice as many minutes in his rookie season as he did this past season (704).</p>
      <p>Minnesota United took the UCLA star first in the 2017 SuperDraft before its inaugural season, hoping he would become a centerpiece for its future.</p>
      <p>"The unfortunate part is you get punished for having a really deep squad when you have more than 12 really talented players," United technical director Mark Watson said.</p>
      <p>"We had some really hard decisions, and we were pretty confident one of our guys would be taken."</p>
