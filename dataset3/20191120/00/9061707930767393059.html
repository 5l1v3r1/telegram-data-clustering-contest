      <p>Luke, who is currently working at Knights Keep in Stretton, said: “I’m so pleased to be named Apprentice of the Year for the East Midlands, it’s brilliant to have my hard work recognised.</p>
      <p>“I have always found the property industry extremely interesting, and <a href="https://www.redrow.co.uk/?mpmdiv=8&amp;infinity=ict2%7Enet%7Egaw%7Ear%7E222432516434%7Ekw%7Eredrow+homes%7Emt%7Ee%7Ecmp%7EBrand+%7C+Midlands+%7C+%28Geo%29%7Eag%7EHomes+%7C+Exact&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIibm3hNvz5QIVhLHtCh2jOgvXEAAYASAAEgIK5PD_BwE">Redrow</a> has given me all the tools I need to build a solid career. I’ve learned so much already, from practical electronics skills to team building, and it’s great to have everyone working towards the same goal.</p>
