      <p>Do you own a small business? If you do, you’ll want to offer your employees an attractive retirement plan. The 401(k) plan stands as among the most widely known and used corporate retirement plans. While your employees might find them attractive, as a plan sponsor, they do pose several challenges.While not required, it’s generally accepted that plan sponsors should adopt <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscarosa/2019/11/18/7-basic-questions-concerning-401k-investment-policy-statements/#7e465e883b8c">an Investment Policy Statement</a> (IPS). These shouldn’t be confused with a similarly named tool used by individual investors. The components of a corporate retirement plan are quite specific to ERISA regulations, something individual investors don’t have to worry about.</p>
      <p>And if you’re like many small company owners, you do worry about the wisdom of formally adopting an IPS.</p>
      <p>“A lot of plan sponsors don’t understand what an IPS is or how to craft one, and of the ones that do, only larger companies have the resources and expertise to create an IPS,” says Jeff Schneble, CEO of Human Interest in San Francisco. “For smaller companies, an IPS essentially becomes another complicated step that makes it harder to get a retirement plan to their employees.”</p>
      <p>Kirk Kinder, owner of Picket Fence Financial in Bel Air, Maryland, advises small business retirement plans. He says, “These plans are run by busy owners who really don’t understand their fiduciary duty, and usually have no idea what an IPS is. The IPS then instills fear in many of these folks as they worry signing the document could come back to bite them later if they don’t follow the process perfectly. Putting your signature on any kind of document like this often scares business owners.”</p>
      <p>How do you act when you conduct a risk assessment? You generally determine both the degree of the exposure and the need to expose yourself in the first place. Often, if the need is not critical, you simply avoid the risk all together.</p>
      <p>“The most common fear plan sponsors feel when creating an IPS is the fear of failure,” says Brandon Grandbouche, Managing Partner at Wealth Harbor Capital Group in New Orleans. “Plans sponsors often don’t understand investments or fiduciary duty well enough to create an effective IPS. This typically leads to a failure to act at all.”</p>
      <p>Retirement plans are likely not part of your revenue generation model. As such, if you deem the risk of sponsoring one is too high, you may decide to skip offering the benefit. The IPS is often viewed as a major part of this risk because plan sponsors may perceive it as exposing them to a definitive regulatory risk.</p>
      <p>You already understand, once you become a plan sponsor, you are subjecting yourself to compliance oversight, and an IPS puts that in writing. By offering a 401(k) plan, you’re inviting government regulator scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“Plan sponsors fear the intrusion and auditing that lurks behind requirements, both reporting and plan design,” says Dan Gallagher of Charlotte, North Carolina, a recently retired financial planner and author of <i>The Secrets of Successful Financial Planning</i>. “These business people dread having the Labor Department and IRS team up to regulate their plan, and they perceive unclarity in regulations as a source of danger that can lead to discrimination suits.”</p>
      <p>It’s possible, if written poorly, an IPS gives those regulators a roadmap to discover compliance discrepancies.</p>
      <p>“There are some plan sponsors who are concerned that if they place a policy in the IPS then it must be followed,” says Craig Chaikin, Vice President and Senior Consultant of Segal Marco Advisors in Greenwood Village, Colorado. “They are concerned about following every single item that is written in the IPS when they aren’t sure what the future will bring.”</p>
      <p>You can’t let these fears get the better of you. To defeat them, consider what strategies you normally employ when you have to confront the unknown.</p>
      <p>“The failure to have an effective policy is just as bad as the failure to have one at all,” says Grandbouche. “To overcome this fear of failure plan sponsors should take the time to educate themselves or seek the help of outside experts.”</p>
      <p>With knowledge comes greater understanding of how to best use this tool to your advantage as a plan sponsor. “To overcome the fear, education is key,” says Kinder. “Once you understand the IPS helps you ensure compliance, without a ton of work, you will see the power of it.”</p>
      <p>Education should address two areas: the wording of the IPS and the compliance process resulting from adopting an IPS.</p>
      <p>Fundamentally, the IPS serves as a contractual agreement. Where do you go to when you want to craft a contract?</p>
      <p>“The IPS is a legal document,” says Jim Scheinberg, Managing Partner of North Pier Search Consulting in Los Angeles. “Clearly a strong ERISA consultant can help with crafting a draft IPS, but in the end an ERISA attorney should sign off on a final version. Under this process, not only do sponsors end up with a thorough document, but they also may potentially be able to claim an ‘under advice of counsel’ defense if ever challenged.”</p>
      <p>The plan sponsor is therefore not flying solo when it comes to the compliance process. In fact, the IPS can institutionalize, along with vendor agreements, the role played by third-party providers with regards to plan compliance.</p>
      <p>Gallagher would reassure plan sponsors that these third-party vendors would be “the first to be audited, not the employer, and that they know how to avoid and handle these things.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, once you’ve gone through the compliance review process once, you’ll become more familiar with it. This also reduces anxiety. Still, Gallagher warns that he’s found “some employers had a bad experience with various regulators and, so, could not be coaxed to trust the process.”</p>
      <p>The best way to avoid this kind of bad experience is to work with professionals who have demonstrated aptitude and proficiency when it comes to ERISA matters and retirement plans like yours.</p>
      <p>After all, your job is to focus on the revenue generating side of the business. That’s the ultimate measure of success and the path to long-term business sustainability.</p>
