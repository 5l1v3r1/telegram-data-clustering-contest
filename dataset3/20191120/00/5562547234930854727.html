      <h1>NCAA Suspends James Wiseman 11 Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/austinkent/" target="_blank">Austin Kent</a></address>
      <p>The NCAA has suspended Memphis Tigers big man James Wiseman for 11 games, the <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/memphis-wiseman-cleared-compete-jan-12">organization revealed</a>. The punishment is in response to the supposed recruiting inducements his family received and the games that he suited up for while ineligible.</p>
      <p>We wrote about the <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/college-hs/james-wiseman-ruled-ineligible-by-ncaa/">NCAA’s official eligibility ruling</a> earlier this month, wherein Wiseman was deemed ineligible to play for Memphis due to a favor that Tigers alum Penny Hardaway had done for the Wiseman family back in 2017.</p>
      <p>Hardaway was Wiseman’s AAU coach at the time – not the head coach of the Tigers – and helped pay for some of the moving expenses when Wiseman’s family moved to the area.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to the 2019-20 NCAA campaign and Hardaway is the head coach of the program and Wiseman, their star center. The NCAA claims that Hardaway qualifies as a booster of the program given that he has donated to the university previously – that would render his contact with Wiseman impermissible.</p>
      <p>In response, the University of Memphis filed a temporary restraining order that they figured cleared the way for the big man to play while the legal proceedings unfolded.</p>
      <p>Eligible or not, Wiseman has wreaked havoc in three college games so far this season. The 7’1″ potential No. 1 2020 NBA Draft pick has averaged 19.7 points, 10.7 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game.</p>
      <p>Wiseman’s camp initially filed a lawsuit when the NCAA made its declaration. That lawsuit, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/sports/ncaabasketball/james-wiseman-memphis-ncaa-lawsuit.html">Billy Witz of the New York Times</a>, was dropped by Wiseman’s lawyers when they figured it had become an impediment to a fair resolution with the NCAA.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/GoodmanHoops/status/1197285139988058112">Jeff Goodman of Stadium</a>, Wiseman’s camp intends to appeal the suspension.</p>
