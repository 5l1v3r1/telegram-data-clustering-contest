      <h3>Arsenal are considering a deal to sign Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Denis Zakaria which includes Granit Xhaka heading the other way, according to reports.</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-ready-use-granit-xhaka-20911632">Daily Star</a> is reporting that Arsenal are interested in a deal to sign the 22-year-old Zakaria in January as the Gunners look to add to their squad in the mid-season transfer window.</p>
      <p>The same story says that this deal would mean that Newcastle United – who have been linked with Xhaka in recent weeks – would miss out on signing the Switzerland international.</p>
      <p>According to the same article, Zakaria’s good form for the German side this season has attracted interest from a host of top clubs, including Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The same story says that Xhaka is almost certain to leave Arsenal in January after his public falling out with Gunners supporters.</p>
      <p>Zakaria has been in good form for Borussia Monchengladbach this season and has scored two goals and made one assist in 11 Bundesliga games so far.</p>
      <p>The same report says that the likes of Tottenham, Manchester United and Inter Milan have all been linked with moves to sign the Swiss midfielder in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The article concludes that any deal for Borussia Monchengladbach to sign Xhaka would be dependent on Arsenal being given first refusal to sign Zakaria in the summer.</p>
