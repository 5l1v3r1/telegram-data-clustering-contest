      <p>Protesting against police action on students and teachers during the ‘Long March to Parliament’ Monday, the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) Tuesday organised a march on campus Tuesday. The teachers also demanded the Vice-Chancellor’s resignation.</p>
      <p>Addressing the crowd, Congress MP Hibi Eden from Kerala said: “This is not just a fee hike, it’s an act of extreme fundamentalism and we strongly condemn it… Even women students were attacked by police and central forces… The central government is trying to use all resources to make sure an institute of excellence is destroyed.”</p>
      <p>The march started from Ganga Dhaba and went through several hostel areas, culminating at the Sabarmati T-Point.</p>
      <p>“We have also marched to demand the V-C’s resignation. By constituting a committee, the MHRD has accepted that the V-C is incapable of running the university. We also want to say that the hiked hostel charges have to be withdrawn,” said Surajit Mazumdar, an Economics teacher, who was among those beaten at the protest.</p>
      <p>The ABVP also “condemned in harshest terms” the way in which police “manhandled” students. However, they said they would continue their struggle separately due to disagreements with JNUSU’s mode of protest, which includes their repeated “bashing” of the ABVP and the Sangh and “vandalisation of university property” among others.</p>
