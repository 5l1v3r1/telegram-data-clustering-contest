      <h1>A Joker Sequel Is Now Likely With Duo Set To Team Up Again</h1>

      <p>Fresh from a hugely successful Box Office performance, Joker is already moving towards a sequel with several key personnel set to be involved.</p>
      <p>The film recently passed the $1bn mark at the global box office. Now, Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix are reportedly keen to team up again and deliver another instalment of the DC story.</p>
      <p>Per the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Phillips and the Warner Bros. Pictures Group are now in the final-stage discussion about the project. It comes as a surprise given Phillips had maintained at the time of release he was determined to not direct a Joker sequel.</p>
      <p>The same report also states that Phillips will be involved in a film about a different DC character. That will also be an origin story.</p>
      <p>The news comes after in an interview with the LA Times last week, Phillips suggested he has changed his mind.</p>
      <blockquote>It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that this does. Because I think that’s ultimately why the movie connected, it’s what’s going on underneath. So many movies are about the spark, and this is about the powder. If you could capture that again in a real way, that would be interesting.</blockquote>
      <p>The timeline of such a film will prove interesting given Matt Reeves is already working on his Batman with Robert Pattinson.</p>
