      <h1>Money Diary: A Student &amp; Bar Crawl Leader In Amsterdam On 9.8k</h1>

      <p><i>Welcome to</i> <i><a href="http://www.refinery29.uk/money-diary-uk">Money Diaries</a>, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking a cross-section of women how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period – and we're tracking every last penny.</i></p>
      <p><i>This week:</i> <i>"I’m a 20-year-old student in Amsterdam, working as a bar crawl host in my spare time. I have a long-distance boyfriend, who I see maybe once every two months. My parents pay for flights home for holidays and I pay for any other trips back. I’m in the lucky situation that my parents pay for the bulk of my rent and living expenses, although this will probably shift when I start my new role as a content writer/PR manager next month. I’m one of those people who is stupidly busy because I really don’t enjoy downtime, and am massively extroverted."</i></p>
      <p><b>Industry:</b> Student/Tourism <br/><b>Age:</b> 20<br/><b>Location:</b> Amsterdam<br/><b>Salary:</b> My parents give me €650 (£557) a month. I earn roughly €300 (£257) a month. So monthly, €950 (£815) and yearly, €11,400 (£9.8k).<br/><b>Paycheque amount:</b> €300 (£257)<br/><b>Number of housemates:</b> One. I moved to a studio apartment this year as I realised I’m a control freak.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Monthly Expenses </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Housing costs:</b> €510 (£437) rent, however I receive €190 (£163) back from the government every month, so really €320 (£274).<br/><b>Loan payments:</b> €0<br/><b>Utilities:</b> €0. Included in my rent, thank god.<br/><b>Transportation: </b>€30 (£25) on OV (a type of Dutch Oyster card) every month. I use my bike more than anything else.<br/><b>Phone bill: </b>£19 (my mum currently pays).<br/><b>Savings?</b> I try to put 200-300 away every month but all my savings are currently empty as I paid my university tuition myself this year – €4,500 (£3,860).<br/><b>ClassPass:</b> €59 (£50.60).<br/><b>Netflix: </b>£3 (I split with my sister so I just transfer half to my mum every month).<br/><b>Health insurance:</b> €99 (£85) but I also receive a government benefit of €99 a month.</p>

      <p><b>Day One</b><br/><br/>11am: Wake up. As I don’t have class until 12 I decided I should at least attempt to get the sleep back from the past week. I normally try and wake up around 9 on days I have later classes.<br/><br/>11.40am: Realise I am running really rather late, so cycle to class like my life depends on it (which it does, as this is a class on esotericism and the teacher may or may not be able to turn me into a frog).<br/><br/>12pm: Arrive at class mildly soaked and very unprepared; we are mainly discussing alchemy and theology today, which is incredibly interesting.<br/><br/>1.30pm: Absolutely starving so buy a mini pizza €2.60 (£2.22) and a Starbucks iced coffee €2.20 (£1.89) from the uni canteen. It's pretty overpriced but I know I won’t be eating again 'til I get home around 6 so suck it up.<br/><br/>2.50pm: Class finished a little early so decide to head out with a friend (T) to Waterlooplein, one of my fave vintage shopping destinations. While attempting to not spend any more money I fall in love with a rollneck sweater and decide money is meaningless so should spend it anyway. €10 (£8.57)<br/><br/>3.45pm: Meet up with one of my classes for a trip to Stedelijk Museum and spend the next two hours wandering around, trying to find a piece to analyse. We eventually settle on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beanery">Kienholz's "The Beanery"</a>.<br/><br/>5.45pm: Pop into supermarket to pick up some food for dinner and the next few lunches. Bf calls while shopping and we chat about the idiotic activities we’ve both been up to and decide when we’re going to see each other next as he lives in England. €7 (£6)<br/><br/>6.50pm: Realise I’ve forgotten oat milk but am now about to start my spin class so make a mental note to buy on the way home.<br/><br/>9pm: Friends come over for pre-drinks and as one had to buy mixers they also picked up oat milk for me from the supermarket (friends are the best!). €2 (£1.72)<br/><br/>11pm: Head on the biggest trek to our university’s anniversary party, which for some reason is on the other side of the city. Top up my OV (Dutch Oyster card) en route. €10 (£8.57)<br/><br/>12.30am: After spending a grand total of 30 minutes at anniversary party, we decide it's crap so head to meet our friend at a different club. We get a Via Van because it's the same price as the tram. €1.50 (£1.29) for my share.<br/> <br/>4am: Only realise I left this late the next day when I go to check price of Via Van home. Someone bought me a plethora of drinks but it wasn’t me so...oh well. €3 my share (£2.57).<br/><br/><b>Total: €38.29 (£32.83)</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Two</b><br/><br/>10am: Wake up and immediately feel the need to clean after last night’s pre-drinks left my flat looking like a tornado hit. Once cleanish, I start working on one of the readings for my philosophy class.<br/><br/>11.45am: I have a meeting with work as I’m transitioning to content writing to make some cash rather than just taking drunk idiots on bar crawls. I pick up some lunch for myself as my fave lunch spot is two minutes from the office – I have bolognas lasagne and a cannoli. €6 (£5.15)<br/><br/>12.30pm: Hit the gym for a boxing class, I have ClassPass so all my workouts are prepaid (is this adulting?). On the way back, I top up OV card so I can actually get home. €5 (£4.29)<br/><br/>2pm: Again I am late for class. I’m normally really on time so I’m not sure what’s going on in this diary…<br/><br/>5pm: Finish a fairly brutal philosophy class; I realised about 10 minutes in that I read completely the wrong text. I now have to finish up a reading report for a theology class before preparing for an event I’m hosting with the society that I help run.<br/><br/>7pm: Still working on theology report and my friend asks if I’ll go for dinner with her as she’s having a wobble about university and life. I get a burger and a coffee. €8 (£6.87)<br/><br/>7.45pm: Arrive at event and help finish setting up. The event is a 'free space to create' for all university students, we provide art materials and a place to use them.<br/><br/>10pm: Event over, I help tidy up then head home, where I finish working on uni projects and collapse into bed at some point.<br/><br/><b>Total: €19 (£16.31)</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Three</b><br/><br/>9am: Wake up and immediately panic that I slept through an entire day and it is in fact Friday. (It's not, it's Thursday.)<br/><br/>10am: After coffee I no longer feel quite so weird and head to university to do some work and prep for a meeting.<br/><br/>12.30pm: Have a meeting to discuss the next two PR campaigns I’m leading for one of the boards I’m on. Realise during meeting that I need to top up my association card. €10 (£8.57)<br/><br/>6pm: Head to my student association (there isn’t really an equivalent in the UK but it's sort of a combined sorority/fraternity). I cycle there so feel healthy and save money. #winning<br/><br/>6.45pm: Eat an incredible dinner at the association and it only costs €4 (£3.43)! I love eating there as it's cheap and generally pretty healthy food, plus I don’t have to go near a kitchen. (I use a prepaid association card so I don’t count this.)<br/><br/>11pm: Towards the end of our <a href="https://amsterdam.mokumevents.com/event/city-game-crazy-88/">Crazy 88 game</a>, which is part of our hazing, we decide as a group that we are in fact starving so head to Maccy Ds to frivolously spend our money. €7.25 (£6.22)<br/><br/>2am: After a rather dramatic evening at the association, which included being wrestled to the ground and me throwing a beer in someone's face, I head out with some friends to honestly one of the worst bars in Amsterdam – but they have cheap drinks!!<br/><br/>4am: Get home after miraculously only spending €5 (£4.29) on drinks (two shots of some sort). I cycled home so again didn’t pay for public transport*.<br/><br/><b>Total: €22.25 (£19.08)</b><br/><br/><i>*Note from R29: Please don't cycle, drive, scoot or take any other form of self-driven transport after drinking!</i></p>

      <p><b>Day Four</b><br/><br/>9am: Wake up incredibly dizzy with pretty colours dancing around my eyes and realise I have a migraine. I don’t get them often so don’t have meds but when I do, they’re so bad that I just have to sleep them off.<br/><br/>1pm: Wake up again and feel significantly better, albeit sad that I missed a class that I really like. <br/><br/>2pm: Have some oatmeal and cycle to a friend's who is ill. He looks mildly like death but is still as sarcastic as ever and takes the piss out of me the whole time. <br/><br/>4pm: Grab a salad box on my way home as realise I am now late to meet my other friend! €3.50 (£3)<br/><br/>6pm: Meet up with my only other friend from London and we head to Starbucks as for both of us it feels like a 'mini London' in Amsterdam. We discuss all the tea and both remark at how settled we are here now. €3.80 (£3.26)<br/><br/>7.30pm: Walk to the office to meet my friend who is working with me tonight. Say hi to office crew and am told I need to come earlier tomorrow to hear all the office drama!<br/><br/>11.45pm: Finish bar crawl, we had possibly the most boring group I have ever encountered but they did buy us drinks and leave a good tip so defo not the worst! I love my job but sometimes the groups are the biggest load of pervy wankers.<br/><br/>12.30am: Finally get home. I ended up getting the tram back but had forgotten my OV card so had to pay for a ticket, which is hella overpriced. €3.50 (£3)<br/><br/><b>Total: €10.80 (£9.26)</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Five</b><br/><br/>10.30am: Wake up confused from a rather bizarre dream. Make a to-do list, which includes buying food to cook with as I seem to have only eaten out so far this week – great for tastebuds, terrible for bank account.<br/><br/>2.30pm: Realise I haven’t eaten yet so chuck together some oatmeal (if you add coffee syrups it tastes 10000x better!) and make myself a coffee.<br/><br/>6.30pm: Cycle to the centre of town so I can do some shopping and hang out with office friends before my shift starts. Thankfully I just miss the rain.<br/><br/>7pm: Head to Primark to pick up some fishnets as I broke mine. While there my friend calls, asking if I can pick up a face mask for her. €4 (£3.43)<br/><br/>8pm: After picking up alcohol and trainees from office we start our bar crawl with some already very drunk Germans (which means it will at least be an interesting night).<br/><br/>11pm: Head back to the office early as we are ditched by the insane group for a strip club. They managed to get us kicked out of two bars in three hours, which is really quite impressive considering how much the bars here put up with.<br/><br/>Midnight: Meet more friends and head to Leidseplein to go clubbing. No one can decide where to go so we end up at Chupitos – cheap shots and terrible music is always a great combo, right? €7 (£6)<br/><br/>2am: My old roommate calls and asks if we can come pick her up at a party as she’s too drunk to cycle. Me and a friend (S) cycle over to meet her to attempt to sober her up.<br/><br/>4am: Still at party, still drunk, end up crashing.<br/><br/>7am: After an incident with one of the guys, I decide to cycle home as I didn’t feel comfortable staying there anymore.<br/><br/><b>Total: €11 (£9.43)</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Six</b><br/><br/>11am: Wake up, not feeling in the best state and call bf about last night. Difficult conversation and we both end up crying but he’s really supportive and I decide to discuss everything with my therapist later.<br/><br/>12pm: Shower and head to the library, which is crazy busy so end up at the café at the end of my street. €2.50 (£2.14)<br/><br/>5pm: Head to the supermarket to pick up food for the week. I just do a little shop so I can meal prep and have snacks for the week. €15 (£12.86)<br/><br/>6pm: Head over to a friend's for dinner and drinks. It's a potluck and as I get alcohol free from work I bring that.<br/><br/>8pm: Appointment with therapist. I recently got diagnosed with anxiety, which has made me realise a lot about myself and understand a lot of my 'quirks' better. <br/><br/>9pm: Decide that now is the time to meal prep/make dinner. I call my friend for a catch-up while I dance around making a huge pot of risotto.<br/><br/>11pm: Feel super organised and decide I should now deep-clean my apartment. I get halfway through before pretty much falling into bed.<br/><br/><b>Total: €17.50 (£15)</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Seven</b><br/><br/>8am: Wake up feeling more rested than I have in a while, so I put some music on and make coffee before heading to class.<br/><br/>10.45am: Cycle to the city centre for a meeting about my new job. I’m a bit nervous and have been told that I will be negotiating my salary and whether I come into the office at all or just work from home.<br/><br/>11.45am: Meeting over and went really well so I treat myself to a calzone from the Italian before calling bf to update him. €2.50 (£2.14)<br/><br/>2.50pm: Arrive at class early so grab a smoothie and an apple from the supermarket. €5 (£4.29)<br/><br/>6.20pm: Class is finally over. It was a difficult class on an area that I don’t know much about so I found it really tough. I head to a spin class to hopefully destress a little.<br/><br/>8.15pm: Get home, shower and debate ordering takeout before remembering I meal prepped for this week! Reheat risotto and curl up on the sofa to watch some trashy TV shows.<br/><br/>11pm: After chatting to bf about plans for the week I head to bed as I know this week will be insanely busy.<br/><br/><b>Total: €7.50 (£6.43)</b></p>

      <p><b>The Breakdown</b><br/><br/>Food/Drink: €79.35 (£68.05)<br/>Entertainment: €0<br/>Clothes/Beauty: €14 (£12)<br/>Travel: €33 (£28.29)<br/>Other: €0<br/><br/><b>Total: €126.35 (£108.34)</b><br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/><br/>"I think this week was particularly hectic; I’m normally busy but not quite this busy. However, in terms of spending I think it’s fairly accurate as to how I would normally spend money. I really enjoy eating out and have an absolute hatred of cooking so would always rather spend money on food/coffee than clothes etc. Saying that, I think I could definitely save more money for travelling if I were to cut down on this a bit and not use my OV so much, especially when it’s nice weather."</p>
