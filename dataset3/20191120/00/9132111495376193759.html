      <p>The fact-finding committee instituted to investigate a sex for grades allegation against Prof. Ransford Gymapo and Dr Paul Butakor, has recommended that the lecturers should be brought before the University’s Disciplinary Committee.</p>
      <p>According to a statement signed by Stella Amoa, Director of Public Affairs of Ghana’s premier university, the committee, chaired by Justice Vida Akoto-Banfo noted in its report to the Vice-Chancellor that there was a prima facie evidence against the two lecturers contrary to Paragraph 6.4 of the Code of Conduct for Academic Staff of the University of Ghana.</p>
      <p>Prof. Gyampo and Dr Butakor were filmed allegedly engaging in several forms of sexual harassment and misconduct in a documentary by the BBC.</p>
      <p>Gyampo in reaction said he is the target of a vile agenda to tarnish his image, insisting he does not do ‘sex for grades.’ In his bid to clear his name, the senior lecturer threatened to take legal actions against the BBC.</p>
      <p>“I had criticised a political party and they felt putting sexual allegations on me was a way of shutting me up. I’ve always said that the worst a politician can do is kill me but even with that, I’m not scared to die. I have a lot to say about this matter. But I am suing the BBC for defamation tomorrow, so I will keep some of the facts to myself for now,” he said.</p>

      <p>The BBC in a Q&amp;A session with Ghanaweb had maintained that Gyampo had indeed flouted the statutes of the university.</p>
      <p>It said: "The extent of our evidence in our documentary shows that Professor Ransford Gyampo broke the University of Ghana’s rules on sexual misconduct when he engaged in inappropriate amorous behaviour with our undercover reporter, Abigail, who he knew as a student at the university seeking mentorship from him, and that he attempted to exploit an academic relationship with her."</p>
      <p>"The university considers “amorous” or flirtatious behaviour towards students by lecturers as sexual misconduct. The policy prohibits sexual relationships between individuals where there is an imbalance of power – such as when one individual is in a position to make decisions that affect the educational opportunities or career of another. Prof Gyampo met Abigail in the context of providing her with academic support at the University of Ghana and advice on pursuing a career in research post-graduation."</p>
