      <h1>Boston U earns 78-70 upset win over South Carolina</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">DAVID CLONINGER</a></address>
      <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a> knew it probably couldn’t match South Carolina physically. The Gamecocks, coached by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/frank-martin/">Frank Martin</a>, are always in the opponent’s face.</p>
      <p>But if they weren’t there to run through …</p>
      <p>“Just getting into the paint, being poised, jump-stopping, pump-faking,” the Terriers’ <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javante-mccoy/">Javante McCoy</a> said after scoring 17 points in a 78-70 upset Tuesday. “I had a lot of good shooters on the 3-point line tonight.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a> (3-2) had six players score at least six points, drained nine 3-pointers and relentlessly pushed the ball past the Gamecocks’ defense. When the Gamecocks collapsed on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a>’s drivers, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javante-mccoy/">McCoy</a> or Alex Vilarino could kick out to an open shooter. When South Carolina began guarding the perimeter, Walter Whyte and Max Mahoney were zipping along the back line for easy bunnies.</p>
      <p>“They’re an old team and they just went at us,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/frank-martin/">Martin</a> said. “Our ball-screen defense was abysmal today. Like, abysmal. It was really bad.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a> recorded 15 assists on 27 field goals and turned a 60-60 game with seven minutes to go into the school’s first win over a current SEC member. The Gamecocks, led by 22 points from star guard A.J. Lawson, couldn’t work the ball inside and began settling for 3-pointers, making a mere 4 of 22.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes we’re just too trigger-happy, too ready to shoot it,” Lawson said. “I guess we’ve got to be more aggressive, get it down to the low post.”</p>
      <p>South Carolina has 10 players who are either newcomers or sat out all or most of last season due to injury or other reasons. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/frank-martin/">Martin</a> likes his collective talent but realizes there will be growing pains.</p>
      <p>“It’s the first time we’ve dealt with real adversity and we became a very quiet, in-our-feelings team. We’ve got to grow up,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/frank-martin/">Martin</a> said. “I wanted to see who would take ownership on our team and unfortunately, nobody did.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a>’s Joe Jones has five juniors or seniors on his squad, including <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javante-mccoy/">McCoy</a>. They combined for 33 points.</p>
        <p>“They’ve been a lot of fun so far this year,” Jones said. “I think there are some great things ahead for us because I think we have the right people in the locker room.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a>: The Terriers posted their first winning streak of the season. They beat New Hampshire Saturday before traveling to South Carolina.</p>
        <p>South Carolina: The Gamecocks suffered a debilitating non-conference loss for the third straight season. Last season’s losses to Stony Brook and Wyoming played a large part in them not getting a postseason bid, despite winning 11 games in the SEC. They lost to Illinois State in 2017-18, another year without a postseason berth.</p>
        <p>TURNING POINT</p>
        <p>Lawson aced a free throw to complete a three-point play and the game was tied at 60 with seven minutes to go. The Terriers immediately went on an 11-2 run to clinch the game.</p>
        <p>During the stretch, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javante-mccoy/">McCoy</a> scored eight points and South Carolina missed three 3-pointers. The Gamecocks’ only points came from two Justin Minaya free throws.</p>
        <p>STAT OF THE NIGHT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a> had 12 offensive rebounds and scored 18 points off them. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/frank-martin/">Martin</a> was worried about his team’s rebounding prowess before the season began due to only having three returning big men.</p>
        <p>That was cut to two when forward Keyshawn Bryant had knee surgery. He could be out for the next 3-4 weeks.</p>
        <p>Maik Kotsar and Alanzo Frink, the other two returnees, had 13 rebounds between them but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a> kept grabbing the crucial ones.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a>: The Terriers head to West Virginia Friday before heading to Mexico to finish the Cancun Challenge. The Terriers will play two games there.</p>
        <p>South Carolina: The Gamecocks host Gardner-Webb Friday before going to Mexico. There they will face Wichita State, led by coach Gregg Marshall, a native South Carolinian who attended South Carolina basketball camps as a youngster.</p>
