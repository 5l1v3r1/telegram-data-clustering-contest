      <h1>Watch the Borderlands 3 Show DLC Reveal Tonight and Win the Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Marco Cocomello</a></address>
      <p>2K Games and Gearbox Software will be unveiling the first Borderlands 3 DLC tonight during the Borderlands Show. Very little is known about the new story DLC, the only small snippet we have seen so far is a video clip showing a possible return of Handsome Jack. We all know we wrecked him in Borderlands 2 so unless he returns as an AI robot or something of the sorts, then we have no idea.</p>
