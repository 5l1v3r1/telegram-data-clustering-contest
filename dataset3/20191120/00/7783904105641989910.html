      <p>When contacted RTO officials, they tried to tweak the facts. Though the RTO officials refused to share numbers of BVG vehicles registered with them, they didn’t even hesitate in backing the firm on the pretext that why the big like BVG who bagged the tender would not register their vehicles?</p>
