      <p>Philadelphia 76ers star Ben Simmons made his long-awaited first regular-season three-pointer in the NBA.</p>
      <p>The number one pick in the 2016 draft, All-Star guard Simmons had attempted 17 shots from beyond the arc in the league.</p>
      <p>Much had been made about Simmons' jump shot and unwillingness to shoot the three following 171 NBA appearances.</p>
      <p>However, that changed in the 76ers' clash with the lowly New York Knicks at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Early in the opening quarter, Simmons received a pass from team-mate Furkan Korkmaz and hailed the three from the corner as the arena erupted in celebration.</p>
      <p>Entering the midweek game, Simmons had been averaging 13.7 points, 7.1 assists and 6.0 rebounds for the 76ers (8-5).</p>
