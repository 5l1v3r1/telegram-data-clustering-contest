      <p>Five members of the Western Togoland movement have been remanded on charges of treason felony after being arraigned at the Ho District court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The five remanded are Peter Godfriend Edem, Mkpe Tornyi Kudjo, Kofi Agbeko, Agbenyega Akudzia, and Ibrahim Tofa.</p>
      <p>The five, believed to be members of the separatist movement, Homeland Study Group Foundation, are to reappear in court on December 4, 2019.</p>
      <p>Peter Godfriend Edem was said to be the Master of Ceremonies [MC] at the event where the Western Togoland independence was declared.</p>
      <p>According to documents from the court sighted by Citi News, Mkpe Tornyi Kudjo admitted to police that he was a Western Togolander ad Kofi Agbeko serves the treasurer of the group.</p>
      <p>The accused persons have been under police surveillance since 2017.</p>
      <p>This comes after the Volta Regional Security Council arrested 10 members of the separatist movement, Homeland Study Group Foundation, on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>This comes after the group declared parts of Ghana as independent ‘Western Togoland State’.</p>
      <p>The leader of the group, 80-year old Charles Komi Kudzordzi, popularly known as Papavi Hobedetor, made the independence declaration at a public gathering in Ho on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>He is yet to be picked up security officials.</p>
      <p>The group first made calls for the secession of the Volta Region through to parts of the Upper East region in May 2019.</p>
      <p>Over 80 members of the separatist group were arrested for assembling for a protest over the arrest of seven leaders of the Homeland Study Group Foundation back in May.</p>
      <p>It was also alleged that group leaders were training some youth to form the core of police and military activities in the supposed new country after the declaration of independence.</p>

      <p>Charles Kormi Kudzodzi, the octogenarian leader of the group had been arrested along with seven others when they first declared their intent to secede.</p>
      <p>The Attorney General in July 2019 eventually withdrew all charges brought against the members of Homeland Study Group Foundation who were working for the secession of the Volta Region from Ghana.</p>
      <p>The accused persons were facing charges of treason, abetment of unlawful assembly and offensive conduct conducive to the breach of peace.</p>
