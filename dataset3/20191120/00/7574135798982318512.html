      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/fka-twigs-played-chicagos-riviera-theatre-pics-video-setlist/"><b>FKA twigs @ Kings Theatre</b></a><br/>It took FKA twigs over five years to finally release her sophomore album <i>Magdalene</i>, but it was worth the wait. It’s widely (and deservedly) considered one of the year’s best albums, and it’s proof that her hyped debut was no buzz-artist fluke. She brings her new songs to life at Brooklyn’s gorgeous Kings Theatre tonight and tomorrow.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/e-town-concrete-playing-first-nyc-show-in-13-years-at-bk-bazaar/"><b>E-Town Concrete, Lion of Judah, Hangman, Combust @ Brooklyn Bazaar</b></a><br/>NJ hardcore vets E-Town Concrete still bring it, though their shows are pretty rare these days and this is actually their first NYC gig in 13 years. It’s also the first NYC appearance in 13 years for Lion of Judah, the beloved and not super active DC hardcore band (who share members with Give, Trapped Under Ice, and more) who released one album back in ’06. Current local staples Hangman and Combust round out the all-around solid bill.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/mikal-cronin-announces-tour-with-shannon-lay-stream-his-new-single/"><b>Mikal Cronin, Shannon Lay @ Bowery Ballroom</b></a><br/>Mikal Cronin and Shannon Lay, fresh off a stint in Ty Segall’s Freedom Band, both just released new albums via Merge and Sub Pop respectively</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/allah-las-share-polar-onion-from-new-lp-add-l-a-nyc-release-shows/"><b>Allah-Las, Mapache, Tim Hill @ Brooklyn Steel</b></a><br/>Allah-Las one of the better current groups mining the ’60s psych-pop scene, with equal emphasis on songwriting and getting the details right.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-wild-nothing-guerilla-toss-ceremony-crack-cloud-more/"><b>Wild Nothing, Kate Bollinger, Office Culture @ Elsewhere</b></a><br/>Dreampop band Wild Nothing, who released Indigo last year, ar back on the East Coast for a few shows.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/billy-corgan-began-his-3-night-nyc-run-pics-video-setlist-announced-new-wrestling-series/"><b>Billy Corgan @ Gramercy Theatre</b></a><br/>Billy — sorry, William Patrick — Corgan has a new solo album out this week, and tonight he wraps up his three-night run at Gramercy Theatre where you can expect a mix of solo songs, Smashing Pumpkins songs, Zwan songs, and maybe a cover or two.</p>
      <p><a href="https://publicrecords.nyc/event/okay-kaya/"><b>Okay Kaya @ Public Records</b></a><br/>As she gears up to release her <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/23-new-songs-out-today-17/">first album for Jagjaguwar</a>, NYC-via-Norway alt-pop artist Okay Kaya plays a full-band hometown show tonight.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/high-on-fire-power-trip-devil-master-creeping-death-announce-tour/"><b>High on Fire, Power Trip, Creeping Death, Devil Master @ Asbury Lanes</b></a><br/>This is a ridiculously stacked bill for fans of punk/metal crossover with long-running sludge greats High On Fire, modern-day crossover thrash staples Power Trip, rising thrashy death metallers Creeping Death, and rising blackened punks Devil Master. The tour hits Asbury Park tonight, followed by two Brooklyn shows this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rapsody-tickets-82215190849"><b>Rapsody @ BUILD Studio (2 PM)</b></a><br/>Rapsody is filming a session at BUILD Studio today at 2 PM, and it’s free to attend. First come, first served.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/david-byrne-now-on-broadway-cast-recording-released-check-out-an-opening-night-video/">David Byrne’s American Utopia @ Hudson Theatre</a></b><br/>David Byrne has retooled his acclaimed “untethered” 2018 for the Broadway stage and while the setlist and arrangements are much like what they were on his tour, songs are now threaded together with new monologues from Byrne, making for a much more theatrical experience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nationalsawdust.org/event/Meredith-Monks-Birthday-Dance-Party"><b>Meredith Monk (Birthday Dance Party), Gavin Rayna Russom, DJ Rekha, Neon Calypso, Jose Rivera @ National Sawdust</b></a><br/>Composer, performer, director, vocalist, filmmaker, and choreographer Meredith Monk celebrates her 77th birthday tonight with a dance party featuring a host of cool DJs and treats by Milk Bar.</p>

      <p><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11146670"><b>Sun Seeker, Duncan Fellows, Carriers @ Union Pool</b></a><br/>Nashville’s Sun Seeker make sunshine pop, steeped in ’60s baroque psych (The Zombies, The Left Banke). Their sound is not overtly retro, though, and they’ve got a great sense of melody.</p>
