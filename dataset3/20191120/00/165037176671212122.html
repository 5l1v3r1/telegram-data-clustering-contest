        <b>There was some confusion surrounding Robert Moreno's departure as Spain head coach, but he says he has "a clear conscience".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Moreno insists he has "a <b>clear conscience</b>" after his stint as Spain head coach ended with <b>Luis Enrique's return to the role</b>, although he acknowledged "<b>a bittersweet feeling</b><i>".</i></p>
      <p>Then assistant Moreno stepped into the breach earlier this year when Luis Enrique resigned as his <b>young daughter Xana battled bone cancer. </b>She died in August.</p>
      <p>Former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique returned this week, however, replacing Moreno, who had <b>worked alongside him in a number of previous positions.</b></p>
      <p>Moreno has not reverted to his role as assistant amid <b>reports the two have fallen out</b>, although he said in a statement on Wednesday he would not assess his final days as Spain boss, avoiding "a <b>spiral of reproaches and justifications for each of the parties".</b></p>
      <p>But the 42-year-old did thank Luis Enrique, his staff, the RFEF and the media, while <b>also apologising for not addressing reporters after his final match</b> in charge on Monday.</p>

      <p>He added in the statement: "I have a clear conscience. It is impossible to please everyone, but I sincerely tell you that I respect all and all opinions.</p>
      <p>"I have always maintained that I am a man of my word and <b>would not be an obstacle in the event that Luis Enrique decided to return.Â </b>I have done so even though it has meant my departure. I wish him well because <b>his joys will be ours."</b></p>
      <p>Referring to the "extreme situation" in Luis Enrique's personal life that led to him taking charge, Moreno said he <b>wished he had never been required to become coach</b>.</p>
      <p>He concluded: "My experience as an absolute coach began and ended in the same way, with a bittersweet feeling. I have to look forward and face new challenges as a coach in my passion, football. I am <b>prepared to face the challenge of leading new projects</b>."</p>
