      </p>
      <p>Ex-Real Madrid and current Juventus player,<b> Cristiano Ronaldo</b>, has apparently married his girlfriend, the model Georgina Rodríguez, in a <b>secret ceremony in Morrocco </b>shielded away from journalists, according to 'Novella 2000'.</p>
      <p><b>Rumours</b> about Ronaldo' possible wedding started in August when the model and influencer Rodríguez published a <b>photo on Instagram talking about Ronaldo as her "husband"</b>.</p>
      <p>These rumours would be correct if we are to believe the information in the Italian magazine, who state that the player's friend Badr Hari organized the ceremony.</p>
