      <h1>Notts County to improve scouting network in a bid to identify foreign talent</h1>
      <h2>Magpies chairman Christoffer Reedtz outlined objectives at fans' forum</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:13:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:13</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Christoffer Reedtz hopes to create an “excellent scouting infrastructure” at Notts County that will look to identify talent in Europe as well as England.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> chairman told supporters at a fans’ forum on Tuesday night that improving talent spotting is one of his medium-term objectives.</p>
      <p>Notts have recruited well already this season with the likes of Wes Thomas, who has scored seven goals this season, and defender Ben Turner being two key arrivals.</p>
      <p>But answering questions that covered a wide-range of topics, Reedtz, who was accompanied by his brother and director Alexander, hopes to expand their search for players across the globe.</p>
      <p>And he hopes that it will lead to success in the future as he hoped to create new memories for the supporters.</p>
      <p>“In the more medium terms there are things we want to achieve,” he said.</p>
      <p>“One is we want to create an excellent scouting infrastructure to identify the right players not just in England but in other countries as well.</p>

      <p>  </p>
