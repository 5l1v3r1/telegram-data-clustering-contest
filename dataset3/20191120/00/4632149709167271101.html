      <p><i>Cleaner also injured in freak accident at granite factory where vehicle broke down</i> <br/><br/>A 33-year-old driver of a 12-wheel lorry died on the spot while its cleaner lost his legs, after the lorry started moving while they were under it and doing some repairs. The driver, L Venkatesh and cleaner Harish, had brought the lorry to a granite factory in Machohalli Gate on Magadi Road to deliver granite slabs on Sunday afternoon. <br/><br/>After delivering the order, Venkatesh could not get the vehicle to start. So Harish and he went under the lorry to repair the self-starter. The lorry started all of a sudden and ran over the duo. As the family members of the victim were in the process of getting insurance, they found that its insurance had lapsed last year. <br/><br/>Both Venkatesh and Harish were from Kolar. They had come to the Balaji Granites on Sunday around 6.30 am with the slabs in the Andhra Pradesh-registered lorry. Venkatesh was killed on the spot after the accident. Both were shifted to a nearby hospital, where Venkatesh was declared brought dead. <br/><br/>Harish is undergoing treatment in Victoria Hospital. <br/><br/><br/>Venkatesh’s brother L Nagaraju told Mirror they found that the insurance of the lorry had expired last year. “This amounts to gross violation on the part of the lorry owner for allowing his vehicle to ply on the roads without insurance. Along with the owner, the granite factory owner can also be equally responsible for taking the services of the vehicle without the mandatory insurance papers. Insurance has to be paid for my dead brother along with the injured lorry cleaner, who has lost his legs. We will approach the police again and will file another complaint about the insurance issue,” Nagaraju told Mirror. <br/><br/>After the accident, a case of death by negligence (IPC 304A) and causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others (IPC 337) has been registered. <br/><br/><br/>“The case has been registered against the driver as he went to repair the vehicle without taking any precautions. Though it is a freak accident, it is not clear if the driver had put the lorry on neutral gear before going under it. They should have sought the services of a mechanic instead of doing it themselves. We cannot comment on the lapse of insurance before going through the documents. If the allegation made by the victim’s family is found to be correct, then action will be taken against the lorry owner. The role of the granite factory owner will have to be checked,” said an officer. The MN Halli police have registered a case.</p>
