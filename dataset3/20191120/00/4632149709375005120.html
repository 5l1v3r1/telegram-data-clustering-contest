      <h1>The Handmade Collective bazaar is back and is celebrating its 10th anniversary with more crafts and stories</h1>

      <p>There’s something inspiring about people who switch their careers because, you know, they’ve finally figured it out! And the 10th edition of The Handmade Collective bazaar, which opens in the city today with a line-up of over 120 craft forms and many workshops, is full of crossover stories. <br/>Allow Mala Dhawan, co-founder of A Hundred Hands, the NGO behind this collective of handicraft makers, to share, “We had 22 artisans in the first year and now over 120 are coming from 22 states. Of course, this includes artisan clusters (120 of them) and a few NGOs and designers, but also a new breed of creators. They are techies, scientists and urban homemakers, who’ve rediscovered the joy of making things, which they so enjoyed as a child.” Like this: <br/><br/><b>Jagadish C</b> <br/>Until 10 years ago, Jagadish used to work as a driver at a design firm in Bengaluru. “After dropping my bosses, I would stay back in the car to pick them up, and observe how they work and reflect on what I saw. “ But even as a child, Jagadish was very creative. “As a kid, I used to make toys out of medicine bottles and since I couldn’t afford to buy gum, I would use a paste of ragi and kanji instead,” the 30-something recalls. <br/><br/>Luckily, his boss spotted the spark in him and encouraged him to make models. Today, he is a bonafide artist, who can “recycle and upcycle anything into anything.” In this edition, he’s crafted quirky things out of e-waste. Plus, he’s doing an installation on Harmony, which is the theme of this year’s bazaar, under the mentorship of art historian Suresh Jayaram. <br/><br/><b>Mita Majithia</b> <br/>She was on a career break when she started tinkering with corrugated cardboard, making lampshades, plates, fruits holders and other home décor items. “After working at a highly stressful job as a software engineering for years, I found this therapeutic,” says Majithia, who’s in her 40s. Ever since she decided not to go back to the corporate cubicle, the experiments haven’t stop and in this edition, she’s debuting her first series of punchtin art. <br/><br/><b>Arati Bedekar<br/></b><br/>Encaustic art is a mixed media technique that involves using heated beeswax, colour pigments and an iron box. It was the love for this Greek hobby that got Bedekar, a chemistry graduate and homemaker, to sign up for a course in the UK. “She’s gone from being a nervous hobbyist to a full-time artist, who’s also been invited by IIT-Bombay for a demo,” Mala says of 40-something Bedekar. From doing encaustic painting on wood to metal and corrugated cardboard in this year, she’s doing it all. <br/><br/><b>Sonia Dhawan</b> <br/>It was during the break she’d taken to look after her ailing father that Dhawan reignited her childhood interest in home remedies, which led her to start a range of personal care items. It was a perfect mix of hobby and research, which this PhD holder in human genetics is so skilled at. At this NGO, which she cofounded with sister Mala, she also heads ‘The Denim Project’, which is all about upcycling old jeans. <br/><br/><br/>Attend the bazaar from 11am, at Jayamahal Palace, November 20 to 24</p>
