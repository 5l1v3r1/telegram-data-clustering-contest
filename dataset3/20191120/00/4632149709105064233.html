      <p><i>Woman seeks grant of land which is under her unauthorised occupation</i> <br/><br/>You cannot claim grant of land from the government which you have occupied without authorisation just because the neighbouring lands have been regularised in favour of other applicants. This cannot be consented as “it is an established position of law that Article 14 (of the Constitution providing Equality of law to all citizens) cannot be invoked to perpetuate illegality,” the High Court has said. <br/><br/>“When a prohibition has been imposed under the enactment, the competent authority cannot go beyond the provisions and regularise unauthorised occupation of lands,” the HC said, rejecting the plea of a woman. The prohibition is under the Karnataka Land Revenue (Regulations of Unauthorised Occupation of Lands) Rules, 1970. It says that “the lands within Municipalities having more than fifty thousand population and constituted under the Karnataka Municipalities Act and within a radius of 5 km are prohibited from being granted, even if an application for regularisation of unauthorised occupation is made.” <br/><br/>Gangamma, from Gangavathi approached the HC after the Tahsildar in March 2017 rejected her application seeking regularisation of unauthorised occupation of 20 guntas of land in Gangavathi village of the same taluk. Her advocate argued that under the Karnataka Land Grant Rules, if such a land is not required for public purpose and not within the municipal limits of Bengaluru or within the limits of other municipalities, Taluk headquarters and town panchayat and within 1.5 km of any village can be granted for the purpose of agriculture. <br/><br/>Gangamma’s application was rejected because the land she sought was within five kilometres of the Gangavathi city. The Government advocate however argued that the case does not fall under the Karnataka Land Grant Rules but under the Karnataka Land Revenue (Regulations of Unauthorised Occupation of Lands) Rules. <br/><br/>Rejecting her petition, the HC said, “If any illegality has been committed by the Tahasildar in regularising the lands which were prohibited under the law, action in accordance with law is required to be taken. At the same time, the submission made by the learned counsel that similar benefit should be extended to the petitioner herein, cannot be countenanced.”</p>
