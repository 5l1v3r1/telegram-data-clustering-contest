      </p>
      <p>The National Youth Service Corps has said only 3,420 foreign graduates out of  the  20,000 who uploaded their certificates online came  to defend their certificates.</p>
      <p>The NYSC added that it would intensify its fight against fake graduates and fake certificates to fish out anyone ineligible to participate in the national service.</p>
      <p>The NYSC Director-General, Brig Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, stated these in Abuja when he visited former Head of State and founder of the scheme, Gen Yakubu Gowon, according to a statement  on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The  NYSC began a policy of physical verification of foreign-trained graduates with the Batch C orientation programme.</p>
      <p>It  means foreign graduates who uploaded certificates online must come to  defend them.</p>
      <p>The  DG said, “Out of a total of 20,000 foreign graduates who applied online for national service in the Batch C exercise, only 3,420 showed up to defend their credentials.</p>
      <p>“This is because we warned them earlier that if they were not qualified, they should not show up.</p>
      <p>“Awareness is also being created on the NYSC Act and the need for qualified foreign  graduates to make themselves available for service immediately after graduation as enshrined in the Act.”</p>
      <p>Gowon commended the NYSC for its efforts to transform the country’s youths to contribute to national growth and development.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the NYSC DG also noted that some of the arrested fake corps members during the Batch B Orientation Exercise had been prosecuted  and jailed.</p>
      <p>He stated this during a visit to the Kubwa Orientation Camp in Abuja, but did not disclose the number of convictions or names.</p>
      <p>“In the Batch B streams 1 and 2, we made several arrests and some have  been prosecuted and jailed,” Ibrahim added.</p>
