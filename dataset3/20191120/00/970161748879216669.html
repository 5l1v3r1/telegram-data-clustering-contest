        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> has teased a brand new scripted comedy where RuPaul is basically RuPaul but with more sequins and more sass (if that’s even possible).</b>
      </p>
      <p>AJ and The Queen has RuPaul starring as Ruby Red and although we only got a 30 second glimpse, we know we will be sat in front our our computers waiting for its release.</p>
      <p>Shantay you stay, Mama Ru, because we want to see what happens.</p>
      <p>The series is created by Sex and the City director and writer Michael Patrick King and sees the down-on-her-luck drag queen go on a road trip across the United States to visit every club she can find.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Along the way Ruby finds a young orphan named AJ (played by Izzy G) hiding in her car for a ride.</p>
      <p>But, of course, the two form a bond that we never saw coming (we did) and they pledge to spread love and acceptance across the country.</p>
      <p>This obviously includes Ruby Red performing great musical numbers.</p>

      <p>All those years of lip syncs on RuPaul’s Drag Race has prepared Ru for this moment.</p>
      <p>If that isn’t already exciting enough news, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/rupauls-drag-race-uk-confirmed-for-season-2-and-you-have-just-one-week-to-apply-11053433/">RuPaul’s Drag Race UK is coming back for season two</a>.</p>
      <p>The drag queen extravaganza has been given the green light to return in 2020 after winning over audiences (and even landing in the UK top 10) with the first batch of performers.</p>
      <p>We’re almost done with the first series, and it’s clear that the show is the jewel in BBC Three’s crown with a staggering 6.5 million total requests on iPlayer.</p>
      <p>‘I want to thank the BBC and all our fans for their overwhelming support of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK,’ RuPaul said of the news.</p>
      <p>‘This season’s queens proved that Britain’s Got Charisma Uniqueness Nerve and Talent and I want to see more! Here’s to another season of love, laughter and light!’</p>
