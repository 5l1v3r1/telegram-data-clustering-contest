      <h1>A Delayed U.S.-China Trade Deal Will Hurt U.S. Stocks, Especially The Tech Giants</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Collins</a></address>
      <p>The markets dropped sharply today at about 1PM EST as Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-timing/phase-one-u-s-china-trade-deal-may-not-be-completed-this-year-trade-sources-idUSKBN1XU2C7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29">reported</a> that a “phase one” trade deal between the U.S. and China “could slide into next year.”  It is very difficult to keep track of the constantly shifting narrative on trade, but the next step in the U.S.-China trade war is very easy to define.  The office of the United States Trade Representative issued a <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2019/august/ustr-announces-next-steps-proposed">press release</a> on August 13th, which included this passage.  <i>Further, as part of USTR’s public comment and hearing process, it was determined that the tariff should be delayed to December 15 for certain articles.  Products in this group include, for example, cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain items of footwear and clothing. </i></p>
      <p>I just cannot believe that this could happen ahead of Christmas, but no one should be surprised since the USTR statement was released more than three months ago.  The goods impacted are almost exclusively shipped on “box ships,” containerized vessels, and given the time to unload at Long Beach and other West Coast ports, it is unlikely that the availability of electronic goods for Christmas 2019 will be impacted materially. </p>

      <p>But look at the types of goods that would be impacted by new tariffs.  Cellphones. Laptops. Game consoles. Those are the bailiwick of the Nasdaq tech giants, and, to a lesser extent, the retailers that stock those goods for customers who still make physical purchases. </p>
      <p>On August 13th, the day of the USTR release, the Nasdaq 100 closed at 7,728.15.  Yesterday it closed at 8,234.67. The 6.6% gain in that time period seemingly reflected the market’s complete indifference to the potential that these tariffs would take effect.  Former CNBC contributor and current Director of the United States National Economic Council Larry Kudlow would drop some happy vibes during interviews with his old network, and the indices would continue to rise. </p>
      <p>But what if there is no trade deal?  Shouldn’t the market be pricing in at least a chance of that outcome?  Of course. Theories of efficient markets would tell us that the stock market is constantly discounting all possible outcomes, but the hyper-green performance of the indices in the past six weeks did not reflect that outlook.</p>
      <p>The markets have been out of whack, and getting in whack can really hurt your portfolio.</p>
      <p>The best way to buy protection against an extended trade war is in the form of U.S. Treasuries.  The very liquid iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treasury Bond ETF, TLT, is a nice long-bond proxy and one on which I purchased call options in the past hour.  The broad market index ETFs, SPY for the S&amp;P 500 and QQQ for the Nasdaq 100, also lend themselves to ease of implementing bearish positions, and I also bought some SPY puts his afternoon.</p>
      <p>In terms of individual stocks, “cellphones and laptops” certainly brings to mind Apple, shares of which have had a magical (+85%) run this year and are long overdue for a pullback.  Also, Tesla shares have risen recently on the hopes of a boost from production at its Shanghai factory–for which a manufacturing license was granted by the Chinese authorities last week–but trade troubles will hurt consumer sentiment in the Middle Kingdom, even for locally-produced goods with foreign nameplates. </p>
      <p>The markets have a way of punishing excesses.  Excess optimism on a U.S.- China trade deal may just be one of those teachable moments for the bulls as we head into December. l</p>
