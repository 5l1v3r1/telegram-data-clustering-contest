      <p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has started investigating the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in the foreign funding case, on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A notice was sent by the commission to both parties. According to the notice, representatives of the PPP and the PML-N have been directed to present themselves before the scrutiny committee of the commission on November 26.</p>
      <p>Both the PPP and the PML-N have been accused of receiving illegal funds from the US and UK. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) Farrukh Habib filed a petition against the PPP and the PML-N at the ECP.</p>
      <p>"The PPP and the PML-N should worry about accounting for the funds they received from the US and the UK," said Habib.</p>
      <p>Habib said that both parties were not willing to discuss facts about their funding. He said that the PML-N had used party funds to launder money.</p>
      <p>"As the petitioner in this case, I will not let the PPP or the PML-N flee," he said.</p>
      <h3>PTI foreign funding case: Opposition parties demand daily hearing </h3>
      <p>Opposition’s Rahbar Committee on Wednesday demanded that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) conduct a daily hearing of the foreign funding case against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).</p>
      <p>The Islamabad High Court was hearing an appeal against the ECP’s decision on October 10. </p>
      <p>During the hearing, PTI’s associate lawyer requested that the hearing be delayed for a short while as the senior lawyer was busy in the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>To this, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani remarked that they cannot delay the hearing. The PTI lawyer then requested that any other date be set for the hearing.</p>
      <p>The court then adjourned the hearing until the first week of December.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media, outside the Election Commission’s office, Rahbar Committee head Akram Durrani said even after five years the investigation against PTI was not complete.</p>
      <p>Durrani said the delay in the hearing of the case was harmful to the nation.</p>
