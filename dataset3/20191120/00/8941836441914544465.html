      <p>COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) - A Georgia woman convicted of shooting her boyfriend to death then confessing to the crime at a mental health facility has been sentenced to life in prison.</p>
      <p>The Ledger-Enquirer reports 45-year-old Yashicer Alexandra Pritchett was found guilty of felony murder on Monday for the 2018 attack on her boyfriend, 51-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tommy-ellis-marshall-jr/">Tommy Ellis Marshall Jr.</a> Under her sentence, she’ll be eligible for parole.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Pritchett and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tommy-ellis-marshall-jr/">Marshall</a> had a dispute over him talking to another woman. Crime scene evidence showed she shot him in the neck as he bent over to fix a TV.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors added that Pritchett checked herself into a mental health center afterward and called 911 the next day, telling dispatchers <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tommy-ellis-marshall-jr/">Marshall</a> was hurt and someone should check on him. Police found his body days later.</p>
