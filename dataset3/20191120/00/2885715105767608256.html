      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:37:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University Tuesday moved the Delhi High Court seeking contempt proceedings against its students for protesting within 100 metres of the administrative block and affecting the varsity’s day-to-day functioning, due to which its working has “come to a halt from October 28”.</p>
      <p>While acknowledging the “right of students to protest and exercise their freedom of speech,” JNU said “such rights have to be exercised responsibly, reasonably and in a peaceful manner.”</p>
      <p>It also sought directions to the police chief to provide assistance to the varsity for controlling ongoing and future contemptuous acts of other contemnors, and remove them from the said area outside the admin block.</p>
      <p>Students are demanding a rollback of a hike in hostel fee.</p>
      <p>In August 2017, the HC directed that no protest shall be undertaken by students within a 100-metre radius of the administrative block.</p>
      <p>The order added: “If the aforesaid orders are not complied with, the petitioner would be at liberty to request police authorities for assistance to maintain law and order on campus…”</p>
      <p>Referring to the 2017 order, JNU arrayed the Delhi Police Commissioner as a party to the petition, and said, “blockade of the administrative block has rendered the entire university dysfunctional”.</p>
      <p>The varsity also named 10 students as contemnors, including the current and former JNUSU office bearers and the university’s students.</p>
      <p>JNU’s standing counsel, Monika Arora filed the contempt petition on behalf of the varsity.</p>
