      <h1>Bayelsa/Kogi Election: INEC Under Attack For Not Canceling Results</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/inec/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral Commission</b></u></a> has been described by the National Coordinator Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, Barrister <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/olusegun-bamgbose/"><u><b>Olusegun Bamgbose</b></u></a>, as a great disappointment over the Bayelsa and Kogi State governorship elections.</p>
      <p>Bamgbose stated that with incidents of violence, killings and snatching of ballot boxes during the electoral process, these were enough signs for the electoral body to cancel the election.</p>
      <p>He noted that the commission did not cancel the election possibly because they were compromised.</p>
      <p>The senior lawyer in a statement released claimed that Nigeria democracy has actually been demonized.</p>
      <p>He said, <i>“The Kogi Governorship election outcome is very unfortunate and disturbing. It’s evident from the circumstances surrounding the election that it was marred by malpractices, violence, intimidation and unscrupulous rigging. INEC is really a great disappointment.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“30 ad hoc staff were abducted and later released after APC achieved their aims. Woman leader burnt alive, ballot boxes were snatched.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Thuggery everywhere. Police officers were chased away. These are obvious signs to make INEC cancel the election but they never did possibly because they were compromised.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He pointed out that Governor Yahaya Bello and others who think they can suppress the masses with their power should know that God of the masses will fight for them.</p>
      <p>Bamgbose described that violence recorded in Kogi State as political rascality and also an act of total executive recklessness.</p>
      <p>He asked how many people in Kogi State rejoiced over the re-election of the APC governorship candidate.</p>
      <p>The lawyer also pointed to the allegation raised by the candidate of SDP, Natasha Akpoti, who claimed that the Governor has ordered his assassination.</p>
      <p>He noted that such reports are not good for our democracy. He added that it is disturbing that our politicians don’t fear God again.</p>
      <p>Bamgbose stated that if things like this continue what will guarantee that 2023 elections will be free, fair and transparent.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“They have clearly shown that they don’t have the capacity and capability to organize free and fair elections in Nigeria. I’ll also want to add that President Buhari should look into this electoral recklessness.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He couldn’t have been President today if Jega had accepted to compromise the Presidential elections of 2015.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He is a beneficiary of free and fair election. He contested three times without success alleging he was rigged out but he is now beholding what he alleged.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’ll then be most unfortunate if he will look the other way in the face of total electoral bastardisation. APC will not continue to be in power forever.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“A time will certainly come when they will return to opposition. PDP boasted that they will remain in power as long as they want but what is happening today.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Our INEC as is presently constituted can’t be trusted.”</i>
