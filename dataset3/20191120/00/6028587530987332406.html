      <h1>Hidden MacBook Pro Feature Lies Behind Massive New Display</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ewan Spence</a></address>
      <p>Now that <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple’s</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbookpro">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is out in the wild, it didn’t take long for the team at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit</a> to get the awkwardly shaped screws out of the hardware <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106">to have a closer look inside</a>. The bigger battery was on show, and much of the technology behind the 2019 scissor switch keyboard echoes the pre-butterfly scissor switch keyboard.But there’s another secret inside the massive MacBook Pro that has been discovered by the team with an able assist <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-lid-angle-sensor/">from Joe Rossignol and MacRumours</a> sourcing internal documentation destined for Apple Authorized Service Providers. The MacBook Pro has a new sensor in the hardware that monitors the position of the screen frame in comparison to the lower base of the laptop:</p>
      <p>"While previous-generation MacBook Pro models have a Hall effect sensor that determines when the lid is closed for sleep/wake purposes, the lid angle sensor in the 16-inch MacBook Pro appears to be more sophisticated.</p>
      <p>“Apple’s service document does not provide any clues as to why the sensor was redesigned, but iFixit speculates that it could provide a clever way for Apple to track how often the lid was opened, closed, or adjusted in cases where the display or frayed flex cables need to be repaired — think 'Flexgate.'

      <p>The Nixonian named ‘Flexgate’ r<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/03/05/apple-macbook-pro-flexgate-problem-design-defect-warranty-repair/#6ed7618b2f0b">efers to an issue with the MacBook screen assembly that resulted in uneven lighting along the bottom of the display</a>. One potential cause was tracked down to a shorter screen cable on newer MacBook machines compared to older models. Apple did not confirm this issue, but <a href="https://ifixit.org/blog/13979/apples-2018-macbook-pros-attempt-to-solve-flexgate-without-admitting-it-exists/">the 2018 MacBook Pro returned to a longer cable</a>.</p>
      <p>The installation of a new sensor and the potential to record a significant amount of data about screen use (such as the angle that a display sits at, the number of open/close cycles, and the speed of closing and opening by an individual user) could provide a lot of diagnostic data to Apple when a machine is brought in for repair. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106#s250599">That’s certainly iFixit’s thinking</a>, and a closer look through the documentation by MacRumors highlights that this sensor needs calibrated after a repair.</p>
      <p>This wouldn’t be the first time that Apple has launched hardware without it being activated - for example we’re still waiting for Apple Tags to be activated in the iPhone 11 family . It could be a diagnostic sensor, or it could be destined for greater things.</p>
      <p>No doubt time will tell.</p>
