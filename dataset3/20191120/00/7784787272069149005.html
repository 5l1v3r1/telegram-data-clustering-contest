      <h3>The Western Bulldogs have become the latest AFL club to officially step away from the gaming industry, finalising a deal to sell their two venues in a bold statement to seven rival clubs.</h3>
      <p>Club chief executive Ameet Bains revealed on Wednesday the licences for Club Leeds in Footscray and the Peninsula Club in Dromana — which hold 65 gaming machines across both venues — had recently been purchased by the Melbourne Racing Club, with settlements to occur over coming weeks.</p>
      <p>In a passionate video to club members and supporters, Bains thanked club president Peter Gordon and the board for their “vision and resolve” in pursuing the outcome, as well as the Dogs’ financial team for their diligence.</p>

      <p>Bains said the Dogs’ decision to divest itself from gaming machine revenue had been a long-term priority.</p>
      <p>“It’s a truly historic and landmark day,” Bains said, adding the move would also better align the club to its “social objectives”.</p>

      <p>The Dogs join Collingwood as clubs to recently leave the gaming industry, with the Pies selling 156 poker machines — also to the Melbourne Racing Club — last year.</p>
      <p>Geelong, which began its pokies exit in 2015, earlier this year indicated its intention to finalise the sale of its remaining pokies by early 2020, while Melbourne’s gaming revenue will cease when its license on the Bentleigh Club in Glen Eira expires in 2022.</p>
      <p>North Melbourne was the first Victorian-based club to stop operating gaming machines in 2008.</p>

      <p>However five other Victorian clubs were recently handed new 20-year licences to operate machines, beginning in 2022 and running to 2042. Those clubs were Carlton (290 machines), Essendon (190), Hawthorn (165), Richmond (97) and St Kilda (83).</p>
      <p>While the Blues hold the most machines of the Victorian clubs, figures from the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulator in July indicated the Hawks generated the most revenue at just under $24.7 million.</p>
      <p>The Brisbane Lions (200 machines) and Port Adelaide (63) are the only non-Victorian clubs in the gaming industry, according to the <a href="https://www.pokiesplayyou.org.au/afl_action">Alliance for Gambling Reform website</a>.</p>
      <p>Sydney Swans, West Coast Eagles, Adelaide, Fremantle, Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants all don’t profit from poker machines.</p>

      <p>The recent sale by the Bulldogs, which won’t be reflected in their 2019 financial results, will help fund the club’s contribution to the Whitten Oval upgrade, as well as allow them to invest more in the Bulldogs’ community foundation and football department.</p>
      <p>“Everyone in the organisation has worked extremely hard to turn our balance sheet around over the last few years, working down significant debt to emerge in the best financial position we have ever been,” Bains said.</p>
      <p>The Bulldogs have an ambitious 2020 aim to sign up 50,000 members for the first time in the club’s history.</p>
