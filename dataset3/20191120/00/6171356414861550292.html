      <h1>Jackery helps keep the lights on throughout a power outage with this combo deal [Sponsored Post]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:05:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/sponsored-post/" target="_blank">A Word From Our Sponsor</a></address>
      <p>Large areas of California – from the Sacramento Valley, to northern Sierra, and along the North Coast – have recently gone dark as local energy providers killed the power grid to ward off potential wildfires. Unfortunately, these extreme measures have left tens of thousands of residents without electricity, air conditioning, or a way to power mobile devices for weeks at a time, and more blackouts may be on the way. In an attempt to help residents combat lengthy outages, Jackery is offering its <a href="https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-240-portable-power-station">Explorer 240 Portable Power Station</a>+ <a href="https://www.jackery.com/products/solarsaga-60w-solar-panel">60w SolarSaga solar panel</a> for $60 off with a promo code.</p>

The <a href="https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-240-portable-power-station">Jackery Explorer 240 Portable Power Station</a> comes equipped with a 240Wh battery capable of charging smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even small appliances, like a television or a mini cooler. Weighing in at only 6.6 lbs., this device is both light enough to move about your home or yard with ease and durable enough to withstand outdoor elements and emergency situations.

      <p>In terms of charging the Jackery Explorer 240 Portable Power Station, the easiest hassle-free way is with the <a href="https://www.jackery.com/products/solarsaga-60w-solar-panel">Jackery 60W SolarSaga</a>. This solar panel captures sunlight with high conversion efficiency up to 23% and routes it into the Explorer 240 Portable Power Station via an attached cable. It's made of durable cloth, zipper, and PET materials, allowing the panel to withstand high temperatures, though it isn't waterproof. When not in use, the Jackery 60W SolarSaga folds up for maximum portability and storage. The Jackery Explorer 240 Portable Power Station can also be charged via a 12V car outlet, or when your home does have power, you can use the integrated AC wall outlet.</p>
