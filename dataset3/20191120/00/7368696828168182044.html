      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Update 1.09 Nerfs Already-Nerfed 725 Shotgun</h1>

      <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is facing a shotgun issue at the moment. If you got killed by someone on the other side of the map, it could be two things, a sniper or the 725 shotgun which has an insane amount of range. Activision and Infinity Ward are working hard to balance the gun and the latest update attempts just that. Keep in mind that the 725 was nerfed just last week but clearly it was not enough.</p>
