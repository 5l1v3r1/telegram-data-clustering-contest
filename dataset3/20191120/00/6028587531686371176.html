      <p><b>Topline</b>: Twitter has vowed to take “decisive corrective action” in the future against misleading stunts pulled during the U.K. election campaign, after a Conservative Party social media account was rebranded “factcheckUK” during the first head-to-head debate between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Johnson and Labour leader Corbyn clashed on Tuesday evening over Brexit and funding for Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) ahead of the general election on December 12.</li>
        <li>During the debate, the verified Twitter account of the Conservative Party press office overhauled its design and title and claimed to be fact-checking the remarks of Labour leader Corbyn.</li>
        <li>Twitter, which has taken a stand against publishing political advertising, gave Johnson’s Conservatives a slap on the wrist this time around but said it would take action against further attempts to mislead.</li>
        <li>Independent fact-checking service FullFact condemned the move as “inappropriate and misleading.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>: “Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election. We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information—in a manner seen during the UK election debate—will result in decisive corrective action.” Twitter said in a statement shared with the BBC.</p>
      <p><b>News peg</b>: Tuesday’s leaders’ debate, aired on ITV, was the first in a series of head-to-head debates before Britain heads to the polls next month. On the agenda was Johnson’s repeated claim to end the Brexit deadlock, while Corbyn claimed that Johnson planned to privatize the NHS. No clear winners emerged—a <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/19/who-won-itv-general-election-debate">YouGov poll shows</a> viewers were pretty split down the middle on who performed best. Voters felt that Johnson was stronger on Brexit, while Corbyn took the lead on the NHS, according to the pollsters.</p>
      <p><b>Chief critics</b>: The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party could be kingmakers in this election if neither of the two main parties can form a majority government, but their respective leaders were not invited to the debate.</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: How social networks address politicians and political advertising has become a fault line issue around the world. Twitter has tried to steal a march on Facebook by announcing a global ban on political advertising from November 22, but as Tuesday’s election debate highlights, social network face tough choices policing the behavior of even verified politicians and political parties on its platform.</p>
