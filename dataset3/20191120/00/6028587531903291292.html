      <p>Tropical Storm Sebastien formed in the western Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, becoming the basin’s 18th named storm so far this hurricane season. Sebastien—like so many other Atlantic storms we’ve seen this year—is relatively weak and lopsided, and forecasters expect it to absorb into a cold front on Thursday. The storm is no threat to land.</p>

      <p>Sebastien formed from a tropical disturbance a few hundred miles northeast of the Caribbean Sea. The tropical storm formed right around <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/">where you would expect</a> to see tropical development during the month of November.  The latest forecast from the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/">National Hurricane Center</a> shows Tropical Storm Sebastien quickly falling apart by Thursday evening, absorbing into a cold front sweeping across the western Atlantic.</p>

      <p>Conditions in the western Atlantic Ocean are far from the tropical soupiness that would typically foster a named storm, but the environment was favorable enough for a tropical disturbance to grow organized. Water temperatures beneath Sebastien are around 80°F, which is suitable to sustain the thunderstorm activity needed to fuel the development of a tropical storm. The tropical storm is lopsided as a result of westerly wind shear blowing thunderstorms away from the center of circulation. A brief window of favorable winds on Wednesday could allow Sebastien to strengthen a bit before the cold front has a chance to catch up.</p>
      <p>Based on climatology, it’s reasonable to assume that Sebastien is the last named storm we’ll see this season. The Atlantic hurricane season comes to an end on November 30, but it’s not completely unheard of to get another storm after Thanksgiving. The Atlantic quickly becomes hostile territory for tropical systems this late in the year. Bursts of cold, dry air, ushered along by increasingly strong winds through the atmosphere, make it hard for thunderstorms to take root and develop.</p>
      <p>Tropical Storm Sebastien is the 18th named storm we’ve seen so far in the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. This year is now tied for the <a href="http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Realtime/index.php?arch&amp;loc=northatlantic">fourth-most active season</a> on record in terms of the number of storms that formed. The all-time record is 28 named storms in 2005, a historic year that exhausted the alphabetical list of names and required the use of Greek letters to name the season’s last six storms.</p>

        <i>Correction: An earlier version of this post stated the tropical storm formed on Wednesday. It formed on Tuesday, November 19. I apologize for my error.</i>
