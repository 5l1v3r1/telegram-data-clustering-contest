      <p>On Wednesday, 20 November 2019, IBM launched Cloud Pak for Security – featuring industry-first innovations to connect with any security tool, cloud or on-premise system, without moving data from its source. The platform is said to include open-source technology for hunting threats, automation capabilities to help speed response to cyberattacks, and the ability to run in any environment.</p>

      <p>According to IBM, Cloud Pak for Security is the first platform to leverage open-source technology, which can search and translate security data from a variety of sources, bringing together critical security insights from across a company’s multicloud IT environment.</p>
      <p>As businesses move further into cloud maturity, applications and data are spread across multiple private and public clouds and on-premise resources. Attempts to protect this fragmented IT environment require security teams to undertake complex integrations and continuously switch between different screens and point products.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here are three capabilities of Cloud Pak for Security:</b>
      </p>
      <p>1· Gain security insights without moving data. Transferring data to analyze it creates additional complexity. IBM Cloud Pak for Security can connect all data sources to uncover hidden threats and make better risk-based decisions while leaving the data where it resides.</p>
      <p>2· Respond faster to security incidents with automation – IBM Cloud Pak for Security connects security workflows with a unified interface and automation playbooks so that teams can respond faster to security incidents.</p>
      <p>3· Run anywhere. Connect security openly – IBM Cloud Pak for Security installs easily in any environment. It provides a unified interface to simplify operations.</p>
      <p>“As businesses move mission-critical workloads to hybrid multicloud environments, security data is spread across different tools, clouds and IT infrastructure. This creates gaps that allow threats to be missed, requiring security teams to build and maintain costly, complex integrations and manual response plans,” says Mary O’Brien, GM of IBM Security. “With Cloud Pak for Security, we’re laying the foundation for a more connected security ecosystem designed for the hybrid, multicloud world.​”</p>
