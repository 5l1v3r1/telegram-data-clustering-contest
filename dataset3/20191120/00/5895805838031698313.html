      <p>Take “hindsight is always 20/20,” “Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards” (Kierkegaard), and even “It seemed like a good idea at the time.” And consider what these three common expressions have in common.</p>
      <p>When you need to decide on something, you’re obliged to evaluate the evidence available and make the best judgment possible—that is, with “good reason.” And the keyword here is <i>available</i>, for rarely is the evidence you have at hand complete or definitive.</p>
      <p>Typically, you can’t be certain of the outcome of your decision: how it will affect others or lead them to respond to you, how you yourself will finally feel about it, or the influence it will have on achieving your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivation">goals</a>—both personal and professional. All you can do beforehand is carefully deliberate on the various ramifications of your decision and hope that your assumptions and inferences are correct.</p>
      <p>Yet however painstaking, however scrupulous, your preparation and planning toward making the right decision, it’s still no guarantee that you may not end up regretting it. You could <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/procrastination">procrastinate</a>, as all too many of us do. But because it’s likely that holding off tackling an issue won’t thereby offer you the assurance required to develop greater <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/confidence">confidence</a> about your (postponed) decision, such a tactic may simply wind up a “pseudo-solution.”</p>
      <p>Some instances of important decisions that are tricky—or risky—to make, for you can’t quite convince yourself that one alternative will ultimately be superior to the other(s), include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>leaving a longstanding, “okay” <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage">marriage</a> for someone you’ve fallen desperately in love with;</li>
        <li>changing careers because you think the one you’re now considering will offer you more satisfaction than the just “all right” one you’re currently in;</li>
        <li>moving to a location that you'd much prefer, but that is distant from your family and support system generally;</li>
        <li>pondering a complex surgical procedure that could fix a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/chronic-pain">chronic pain</a> condition, but which might also lead to unpredictable, negative consequences; and</li>
        <li>feeling pressure to choose a job applicant for a vital position in your firm after analyzing the unfortunately mixed results from interviews and testing with almost a dozen of them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, for most of us, the decisions we need to make almost on a daily basis are much more mundane than these examples illustrate. Still, you’ll likely discover that in many instances you lack the information to evaluate the various alternatives as objectively as would be optimal. And also that a multitude of more subjective, <i>emotional </i>considerations render making a more “detached” judgment impossible.</p>
      <p>An article published in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/when-human-judgment-works-well-and-when-it-doesnt"><i>Harvard Business Review</i> (2014)</a> by Andrew McAfee, entitled “When Human Judgment Works Well, and When It Doesn’t,” discusses the many conundrums of using our best judgment in the context of professional matters. But it has broad applicability as well to everyday layperson concerns.</p>
      <p>In his piece, he argues: “We should generally be relying a lot less on the judgments, diagnoses, and forecasts of human ‘experts,’ and a lot more on the outputs of cold, hard, data-driven algorithms.” And his reasoning is based on his analysis of a “raft load” of research that in comparing predictions of experts to those of algorithms found that the great majority of these investigations concluded that the algorithms were as good as, or significantly better than, those of the experts. More revealing still:</p>
      <blockquote>Most of these studies took place in messy, complex, real-world environments, not stripped-down laboratory settings. Commenter Sean Kennedy pointed out that ". ... many of our decisions have to be made under much less than ideal “big data” conditions. Data is often lacking, low-quality, or conflicting.” This is true, and what’s amazing is that these are exactly the conditions under which algorithms do better than people.</blockquote>
      <p>Finally, in further supporting his thesis, McAfee brings in Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman’s celebrated 2001 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"><i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i></a>. In that author’s words:</p>
      <blockquote>Statistical algorithms greatly outdo humans in noisy environments for two reasons: they are more likely than human judges to detect weakly valid cues and much more likely to maintain a modest level of accuracy by using such cues consistently.</blockquote>
      <p>Or, as McAfee puts it:</p>
      <blockquote>People often miss cues (i.e. data) in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/environment">the environment</a> that would be useful to them, and even when they are aware of such cues they don’t use them the same way every time. In other words, the fact that most real-world environments are messy and noisy does not favor human experts over algorithms; in fact, just the opposite.</blockquote>
      <p>So, to get to the main point of this post—as yet, not articulated—don’t blame yourself when your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making">decision-making</a> turns out erroneous. The unalterably “messy” framework of reality can make it difficult-to-impossible to properly weigh all the factors necessary to arrive at the right decision. Even when your thought process has been as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/conscientiousness">conscientious</a>, rigorous, and meticulous as you could make it, inevitably there will be times when you wish you’d considered things differently—and so come to a different conclusion.</p>
      <p>As a psychologist, so many people I’ve worked with have blamed themselves (at times mercilessly) for mistakes that in the past they hadn’t been able to identify as such. And, indeed, a major part of their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a> involved prompting them to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/forgiveness">forgive</a> themselves for not knowing any better than, realistically, they could have at the time.</p>
      <p>Ask yourself, then: Might you still harbor <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a> with yourself, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/guilt">guilt</a>, or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">shame</a> for decisions you made earlier that led to consequences that, at the time, you could hardly have anticipated?</p>
