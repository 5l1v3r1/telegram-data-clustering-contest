      <p>The District Court has dismissed embattled senior police officer, ACP Benjamin Agordzo’s lawyers’ attempt to have him released using legal technicalities.</p>
      <p>The lawyers, led by Martin Kpebu asked the court to allow their client to go home after state prosecutors had withdrawn the charge sheet on which he was being held.</p>
      <p>Their application was objected to by the prosecutor, ASP Sylvester Asare who described the argument by the defense as not founded on law.</p>
      <p>ASP Asare further argued that the substitution of the charge sheet was only to consolidate the two cases having to do with the alleged coup plot and not an acquittal.</p>
      <p>The Magistrate Eleanor Kakra Bans Botwe in her ruling said conventions and law do not show that prosecution has committed any wrong. The decision paved the way for a new charge sheet to be presented and the cases consolidated.</p>
      <p>The accused will still face the charges of treason felony and abetment to commit crime, namely treason felony.</p>
      <p>They were further remanded in police and military custody till the 4th of December.</p>
      <p>
        <b>High Court denies accused persons bail</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week, the High Court dismissed a bail application by the seven accused persons facing trial for their alleged plot to topple the government.</p>
      <p>According to the Judge, Justice George Buadi, none of the accused persons had been detained beyond two months and their arrest and detention are not arbitrary or unlawful.</p>
      <p>He further added that the accused persons have the capacity to interfere with investigations if released.</p>
      <p>The Judge cited an example of how Junior Officers managed to stage a coup in the country.</p>
      <p>The nine persons, three civilians, and six military personnel are facing charges of treason felony and conspiracy to commit treason felony.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Key interrogation</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Director of the Transformation Office of the Ghana Police Service, ACP Dr. Benjamin Agordzo is also facing trial over the alleged plot.</p>
      <p>The BNI and National Security operations confirmed that former Executive Secretary at the office of the IGP, Superintendent Peter Toobu Lanchene has also been invited for questioning.</p>
      <p>Supt. Toobu, who is the NDC parliamentary candidate for Wa West Constituency in the Upper West Region also worked in the office of former IGP, David Asante-Apeatu.</p>
      <p>COP Nathan Kofi Boakye, has also been interrogated in connection with the development.</p>
      <p>Already, some nine persons including Dr. Frederick Yao Mac-Palm, who’s believed to be the lead mastermind, have been charged for treason felony and are standing trial.</p>
