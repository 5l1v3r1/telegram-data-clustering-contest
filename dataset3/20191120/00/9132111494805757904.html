      <p>The Minister of Education, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh affectionately called NAPO has announced Ghana’s bid for election to the Executive Board of UNESCO, Mypurefmonline.com reports.</p>
      <p>Addressing the global body as the head of Ghana’s delegation to UNESCO’s 40th General Conference currently underway in Paris, France, the Minister solicited the support of member states in a bid and spelt out some of the areas of activity Ghana has pursued in the past year.</p>
      <p>The Education Minister outlined steps Ghana is taking to consolidate the gains of the ‘Year of Return 2019’ project announced earlier by President Akufo-Addo and which continues to enjoy support from UNESCO.</p>
      <p>He also reiterated Ghana’s proposal to upgrade the Institute of Education Planning and Administration (IEPA) of the University of Cape Coast to a Category II status, with the Government of Ghana contributing $3.4m annually to the operations of both the proposed IEPA Centre and the AIMS Ghana Category II Centre.</p>
      <p>UNESCO’s Executive Board is one of its three constitutional organs and is elected by the General Conference.</p>
      <p>Acting under the authority of the General Conference, the Board examines the programme of work for the organization and corresponding budget estimates submitted to it by the Director-General.</p>
      <p>The Board consists of 58 member states with a four-year term of office. Ghana has come to the end of its first four-year term, having previously been appointed to the board in 2015.</p>
