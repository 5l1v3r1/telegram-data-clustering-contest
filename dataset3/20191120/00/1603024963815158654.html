      <p>Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday refused to comment on the progress being made in the formation of a new government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Her response came as Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut exuded confidence that a government led by his party will be in place by next month in Maharashtra. He said the picture will become clear in the next two days.</p>
      <p>"No comments," Gandhi said in Parliament House when reporters posed questions on the political situation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra on November 12 amid a stalemate over government formation after the assembly polls last month.</p>
      <p>In the October 21 Maharashtra polls, the BJP-Sena saffron alliance won 105 and 56 seats respectively in the 288-member assembly. The Congress and the NCP, pre-poll allies, bagged 44 and 54 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>However, failing to evolve a consensus over the chief minister's post, the two saffron parties parted ways, with the Sena exploring the possibility of tying up with the Congress-NCP.</p>
