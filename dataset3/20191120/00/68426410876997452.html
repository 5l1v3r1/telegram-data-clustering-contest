      <p>Ottawa Senators forward Bobby Ryan will be away from the team indefinitely while taking part in the NHL/National Hockey League Players’ Association assistance program.</p>
      <p>The NHL and NHLPA made the announcement Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Both organizations said they will have no further comment.</p>
      <p>The Senators later put out a statement from general manager Pierre Dorion.</p>
      <p>“Bobby is an important member of the Ottawa Senators family and he has our full support as he tends to this matter,” Dorion said.</p>
      <p>Ryan, 32, did not play for Ottawa in a win in Detroit on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Postmedia reported he left practice early on Monday because he was not feeling well, according to coach D.J. Smith.</p>
      <p>The No. 2 overall pick by Anaheim in the 2005 draft, Ryan has one goal and three assists in 16 games this season. He has not played five games for Ottawa this season.</p>
      <p>Ryan is the highest-paid player on the Senators. His seven-year, US$50.8-million contract expires after the 2021-22 season.</p>
      <p>The Senators acquired Ryan in a trade with Anaheim in July 2013, on the same day they lost franchise player Daniel Alfredsson to the Detroit Red Wings in free agency.</p>
