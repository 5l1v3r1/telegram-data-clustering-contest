      <p>Two teachers of a private school in West Delhi’s Naraina Vihar have been arrested on charges of abetment of suicide, of a class VII student last year, said police. The 12-year-old girl, who hanged herself at her house, had written the names of the two teachers on her palms and hands and left behind a suicide note.</p>
      <p>Police said the girl’s class teacher and science teacher were arrested on November 17.</p>
      <p>“They were produced before a Delhi court, which sent them to 14-day judicial custody. Police arrested them after some students corroborated the victim’s allegations — that she was humiliated by them,” said a senior officer.</p>
      <p>The incident took place on December 1 last year. “On her palms and hands, she wrote that she did not want to go to school anymore. She apologised to her mother and grandmother… Initially, West district police refused to lodge an FIR but her mother moved court. After the court’s orders, a case was lodged which was transferred to the Crime Branch,” said the officer.</p>
      <p>One of the accused had applied for bail at the Delhi High Court which was rejected.</p>
      <p>Justice Brijesh Sethi said, “Material on record, prima facie reveals that the deceased was compelled to take such a drastic step because of deep mental pain/hurt caused by the alleged misbehaviour and hostile treatment extended by the petitioner. It is very difficult to ignore the suicide note, where the deceased child states that she has been falsely implicated by class VI students because of her class teacher Aarti and petitioner Ritika…”</p>
      <p>“The petitioner (Ritika) is working as a teacher in the same school where the incident took place. The deceased has clearly named her in the suicide note, and there are statements of other witnesses on record which reveal that harsh and bitter words were used by the petitioner against the child and she was called ‘characterless’… The anticipatory bail application of the petitioner is, therefore, dismissed,” the judge said.</p>
