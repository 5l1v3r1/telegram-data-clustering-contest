      <h1>Common arthritis drug could halt breast cancer before it becomes terminal</h1>

      <p>Drugs commonly used to treat arthritis could help prevent the spread of breast cancer.</p>
      <p>Researchers found three NHS <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/facts-arthritis-how-you-can-6416990">arthritis</a> drugs had the potential to stop the disease reaching a patient’s bones, where it becomes incurable.</p>
      <p>The discovery means anakinra, canakinumab and sulfasalazine could be used to treat breast cancer once more testing has been done.</p>
      <p>Scientists found bone marrow releases a protein called interleukin 1-beta that helps cancerous cells grow and make secondary tumours in bones which cannot be treated.</p>
      <p>The team from the University of Manchester and University of Sheffield found the three drugs blocked that process.</p>
      <p>Following treatment with anakinra, only 14% of mice in the study developed secondary tumours in the bone, compared to 42% of control animals.</p>

      <p>More research is needed to understand how these drugs may interact with the immune system and other cancer therapies.</p>
      <p>Lead author Dr Rachel Eyre, of the University of Manchester, said: “We will now look to see if similar processes are also involved in breast cancer growing in other organs, such as the liver and lungs.</p>
      <p>“We hope we could in future identify those at high risk of their breast cancer spreading, and where possible use drugs already available to prevent this from happening.”</p>
      <p>Breast Cancer Now, which largely funded the study, said around 55,000 women and 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, making it the UK’s most common cancer.</p>
      <p>It kills about 11,500 women a year, almost all from tumours that have spread to other parts of the body.</p>
      <p>It most commonly spreads to the bones, brain, lungs or liver.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Baroness Delyth Morgan said: ““While more research is needed, it’s really exciting that these well-tolerated and widely-available arthritis drugs may help prevent secondary breast cancer in the bone."</p>
