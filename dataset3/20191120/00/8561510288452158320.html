      <h1>Ride-Hailing Apps Linked to an Increase in Binge Drinking</h1>
      <h2>When Uber becomes your designated driver.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/victor" target="_blank">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <p>Ride hailing apps like Uber and Lyft are <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ride-hailing-apps-traffic-worse">clogging up streets</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-minimum-wage-proposal-for-drivers-california-ab5-2019-8">don’t provide</a> their drivers with a living wage. But, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418782/uber-drunk-driving-crashes-study-cities">some argue</a>, at least they might be stopping people from driving while drunk.</p>
      <p>But the relationship between binge drinking and ride-sharing apps may be more complicated than that. If you know you can get a safe ride home from the bar, the thinking goes, maybe you’ll stay for an extra round. Or five.</p>
      <p>A study by a team of researchers from the University of Louisville and Georgia State University found that alcohol consumption and binge drinking rose by three and eight percent respectively in cities where ride-hailing services become available, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/11/19/after-uber-arrives-heavy-drinking-increases"><i>Economist</i> reports</a>.  Interestingly, in cities without public transport, the effect was even greater.</p>
      <p>The researchers used data collected by America’s Centres for Disease Control and matched it to when Uber became available in major cities. A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3484845">paper</a> of their research was uploaded to the research repository <i>SSRN </i>last week and has yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/1392">different study</a>, from February, found that the number one reason people chose to grab an Uber was so that they could drink. In 2015, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-uber-restaurant-drinking-20150921-story.html"><i>LA Times</i> also reported</a> that ride-hailing services were linked to a surge in alcohol consumption.</p>
      <p>Despite the data, it’s important to note that there’s still no direct evidence of any causal link between ride-hailing services and binge drinking. Previous <a href="http://wfs.gc.cuny.edu/Economics/RePEc/cgc/wpaper/CUNYGC-WP013.pdf">studies</a> have tried to link a decline in DUI-related incidents to the use of ride-share apps, but the relationship is far more complicated than that.</p>
      <p>“DUI is a complex subject with many causes,” Chris Cochran of the California Office of Traffic Safety told the <i>LA Times</i> in 2015. “To be able to postulate whether the advent of Uber or other ride-share services had any significant effect would be difficult if not impossible.”</p>
