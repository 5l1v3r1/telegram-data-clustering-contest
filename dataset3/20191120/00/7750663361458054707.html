      <p>After a poor start to their Premier League campaign, Spurs announced on Tuesday that they had chosen to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/sack-race/news/spurs-part-ways-with-mauricio-pochettino_379916.html">remove Pochettino from his position</a> in the dugout.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the development, Mourinho was installed as the bookmakers favourite to replace the Argentine, and it now appears that the Portuguese is one of the leading candidates.</p>
      <p>According to <i>BBC Sport</i>, Mourinho is 'a strong contender', with talks already said to be underway between both parties.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old, who has previously managed Spurs' London rivals Chelsea, has been out of work since being sacked as Manchester United boss in December 2018.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is also based in England's capital, something which will only increase speculation regarding a potential appointment.</p>
