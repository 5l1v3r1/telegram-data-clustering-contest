      <h1>Manchester City lining up new Raheem Sterling contract?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> are reportedly prepared to hand <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raheem-sterling/"><b>Raheem Sterling</b></a> a new contract, which would include a substantial pay rise.</h2>

      <p>While the winger only penned extended terms 12 months ago, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> are allegedly ready to offer the England international an opportunity to move to La Liga.</p>
      <p>Despite Sterling still having over three-and-a-half years left on his current deal, it appears that City are willing to further acknowledge the 24-year-old's growing importance to the club.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, Sterling is to be offered a deal worth Â£375,000 per week in the near future.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that the wage packet would match <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-de-gea/"><b>David de Gea</b></a>'s earnings at city rivals Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Sterling has scored 14 goals from 17 appearances in all competitions during this campaign.</p>
