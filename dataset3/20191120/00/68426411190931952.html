      <p>Cody Glass recorded a goal and an assist, and the Vegas Golden Knights defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2 on Tuesday in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Mark Stone, Tomas Nosek and Cody Eakin also scored for Vegas. Max Pacioretty had two assists, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 31 saves.</p>
      <p>Jason Spezza had a goal and an assist, Zach Hyman also scored, and Frederik Andersen made 33 saves for the Maple Leafs. Toronto’s losing streak stretched to six games (0-5-1), its longest since an 0-5-1 stretch from Feb. 27-March 7, 2016.</p>
      <p>Spezza scored on a hard wrist shot at 7:26 of the third period to tie the game at 1-1 and end Fleury’s bid for a second straight shutout.</p>
      <p>The Golden Knights moved back ahead 42 seconds later when Nosek poked the puck away from Toronto defenceman Tyson Barrie at the red line, leading to a breakaway. Nosek made a move on Andersen before backhanding the puck into the net for a 2-1 lead.</p>
      <p>Stone scored from the bottom of the right circle with John Tavares in the penalty box for hooking, stretching the Vegas lead to 3-1 at 10:22.</p>
      <p>Hyman came back with a power-play goal at 12:47 to cut the deficit to 3-2.</p>
      <p>Fleury made a diving save on a rebound try by Nic Petan with 3:43 left, then helped killed a power play that began with 3:20 remaining before Eakin scored into an empty net with 21 seconds left for the 4-2 final.</p>
      <p>Vegas was on the first power play of the game when Pacioretty took a one-timer from just above the right faceoff dot.</p>
      <p>The puck squeezed through Andersen’s pads and briefly stopped in the crease before Glass pushed it across the goal-line at 8:07 of the second period.</p>
      <p>It marked the eighth straight game in which the Maple Leafs allowed the first goal.</p>
