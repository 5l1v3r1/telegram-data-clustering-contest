      <p><b>in collaboration with air co., <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/joe-doucet/">joe doucet x partners</a> (JDXP) has developed the world’s most sustainable vodka. </b>to achieve this ambitious goal, the new york city based design team considered every aspect of sustainability to create a product that is not only carbon-neutral but also removes 1 pound of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with each bottle of alcohol that is produced.</p>

      <p><b>when developing the brand identity for ‘<a href="https://aircompany.com/">air co. vodka</a>‘</b> <b><a href="http://joedoucet.com/">JDXP</a> aimed to reflect the purity of the alcohol. </b>this can be seen by the clear bottle design and the minimal labelling. in addition to the aesthetics of the product, due consideration has also been paid to the sustainability of the packaging. labelling is reduced to minimize material usage and is fixed to the bottles using a non-toxic adhesive that allows it to be easily removed, allowing the glass containers to be recycled or reused.</p>

      <p><b>the vodka itself is marketed towards air co.’s extraordinary, patented technology that transforms the core elements of air, water and sunlight into ultra-refined alcohol. </b>furthering its sustainable credentials, the process also works to remove excess carbon from the atmosphere at a rate of 1 pound of CO2 per bottle. marking the brand’s first foray into the consumer market, the design by JDXP has been closely developed with air co. founders, stafford sheehan and gregory constantine to reflect the company’s mission to <i>‘create goods that do good.’</i></p>
