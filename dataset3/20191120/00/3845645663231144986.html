      <p>When asked about the change, Police Public Relations Branch Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen said the new slogan had been introduced at events this year to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the Hong Kong Police Force.</p>
      <p>“The police force has evolved over time. We will use a new motto in reference to changes in current society,” he said.</p>

      <p>“The new motto expresses the honour, duty and loyalty of our colleagues, hoping that we will meet the ever-increasing demand from the public,” he added.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been shaken by 25 weeks of unrest triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill which would have enabled fugitive transfer to mainland China. The movement has evolved into wider calls for democratic reform and accountability for the police handling of the crisis.</p>
