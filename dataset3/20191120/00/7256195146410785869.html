        <b>In October teams of second-year Unitec Architecture students designed, modelled, then constructed interactive light installations in Devonport’s Windsor Reserve for GLOW@Artweek. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The brief is strict. Their budget is zero. And the installations must be zero waste too, both in the construction and in the afterlife of the projects. These strict conditions on Unitec’s installations for GLOW@Artweek are designed to teach the students about how to reduce waste without compromising quality. It’s an essential skill for future architects who will be working in an industry that is lagging behind in waste reduction.</p>
      <p>For most of the students, it was the first project where they built, exactly to scale, what they’d planned and designed. It was an opportunity to learn skills that will last them for their whole professional careers, and a special experience seeing their designs come to life.</p>
      <p>The Spinoff followed the process, from design to construction.</p>
