      <p>WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) - High tidal flooding forced the Battleship North Carolina to close early this week, and officials are warning visitors to check the website before planning a trip.</p>
      <p>News outlets report Battleship North Carolina spokeswoman Stacie Greene Hidek says high tidal flooding is expected to continue through the next week and may result in further limited hours. The battleship closed early on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>High tidal conditions and rising sea levels have increasingly become a problem for the battleship, which is moored along the Cape Fear River across from downtown Wilmington.</p>
