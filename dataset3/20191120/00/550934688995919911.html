      <h4>A lawsuit by Germany's far-right AfD challenging scrutiny by Thuringia state authorities has been dismissed by the region's constitutional court. Observation status was declared last year by its intelligence agency.</h4>
      <p>Thuringia's top court on Wednesday threw out the Alternative for Germany (AfD) lawsuit on the grounds that as plaintiff it had inadmissibly used a legal procedure normally reserved only for disputes between governmental "organs."</p>
      <p>As such, the AfD was not an "organ," nor did that designation apply to one of four targets of its complaint; Stephan Kramer, the president of Thuringia's domestic intelligence service (<i>Verfassungsschutz</i>), the court opined.</p>

      <p>The only applicable defendant for such a complaint had been Thuringia's interior minister, Georg Maier, but he himself had not made the scrutiny declaration challenged by the AfD, concluded <a href="http://www.thverfgh.thueringen.de/">Thuringia's ThVerfGh six-judge constitutional court</a> (<i>Verfassungsgerichthof</i>).</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Scene' preparing for violent acts</b>
      </p>
      <p>A year ago, Thüringia's own intelligence service headed by Kramer had used the presentation of  region's annual intelligence report — alongside Maier — to rank the AfD as an "examination case," allowing closer observation.</p>
      <p>Germany's news magazine <i>Der Spiegel </i>in October 2018 had quoted Kramer as saying the far-right extremist "scene" was gearing up for violent targeted acts, intimidation and "in particular" confrontation.</p>

        <b>Nationwide ranking retracted</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last March, Germany's federal BfV agency based in Cologne — otherwise known as the Office for the Protection of the Constitution — had to retract its "examination case" ranking for the AfD as a whole after a ruling by Cologne's Administration Court.</p>
      <p>Instead, the BfV ended up using a weaker label of "suspicious case" (<i>Verdachsfall</i>) but only to observe the nationwide AfD's strindent arch-conservative wing (<i>Flügel</i>), led from Thuringia by a prominent AfD figure Björn Höcke.</p>
      <p>Höcke, who led the AfD to a 23.4% second-placing in Thuringia's assembly election last month, was among AfD plaintiffs named in Wednesday's court ruling.</p>
      <p>Thuringia's top-placed post-communist Left party led by incumbent premier Bodo Ramelow is currently holding talks with electorally bruised centrist parties in the Erfurt assembly in a bid to form a second-term coalition cabinet.</p>

        <b>'Pure contempt for the state'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kramer, in remarks carried by <i>Spiegel</i> last October, warned that "many" in Germany's far-right "scene" wanted to take the law into their own hands. </p>
      <p>"Behind all this is pure contempt for the state," said Kramer, asserting that extremist right-wingers were "against foreigners, against political opponents" and were organizing martial combat contests and survival training.</p>
      <p>"Some groups and persons also take part at exercises abroad with lethal (<i>scharfen</i>) weapons," he asserted.</p>
      <p>Kramer's remarks coincided at that time with <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-thuringia-state-on-alert-for-neo-nazi-rock-concerts/a-45781026">far-right rock concerts</a>, including one terminated by police in central Thuringia's city of Apolda — otherwise known for its metallurgic tradition of making bells.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'How it began in 1933'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, Paul Ziemiak, the general-secretary of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in a guest article run by <i>Spiegel</i> accused the AfD of "openly and visibly building bridges to right-wing extremism" and was trying to "delegitimize" Germany's post-war parliamentary system from the "fringe" of Germany's constitutional order.</p>
      <p>"That's how it began in 1933," said Ziemiak, referring the rise of the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler.</p>
      <p>"Höcke is for me a Nazi and the AfD with him on the way to NPD 2.0, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/paul-ziemiak-cdu-generalsekretaer-afd-ist-anti-deutschland-partei-gastbeitrag-a-1295061.html">Ziemiak asserted</a>.</p>
