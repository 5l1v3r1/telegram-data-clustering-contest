      <p>The North Sea oil and gas industry could play a significant role in the transition to cleaner energy, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Turning the Tide, a paper by PwC and Oil and Gas UK, sets out how the sector could move towards low-carbon production and set a precedent for a greener future.</p>
      <p>It argues alternative-use infrastructure could be used for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology and the production of hydrogen.</p>
      <blockquote>There is a necessary urgency to move to a low-carbon world<cite>Drew Stevenson, PwC</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The report is based on interviews with more than 20 key energy industry stakeholders, highlighting how recent changes in ownership have seen independents and private equity-backed firms gain a strong position in the region.</p>
      <p>Drew Stevenson, energy sector leader at PwC UK, said: “There is a necessary urgency to move to a low-carbon world.</p>
      <p>“As our report illustrates, there is huge potential for the North Sea to play a significant role in the energy transition, setting a precedent for facilitating the move to a clean energy future.</p>
      <p>“The appetite exists for the North Sea energy industry to play a significant role in the transition.</p>
      <p>“Investor sentiment is rapidly becoming more committed to low carbon technologies while smaller exploration and production companies are looking at ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations.</p>
      <p>“All of this creates an opportunity for the North Sea to lead the way in the energy transition.”</p>
      <p>CCUS is the practice of capturing the carbon dioxide released by industrial sources such as power stations and burying it deep underground.</p>
      <p>Infrastructure is already in place across the region that could be used to store the gas through depleted oil and gas fields, according to the paper.</p>
      <p>It adds that the North Sea can play an important role in a technology that is seen as a way of helping to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>The report also argues the region could be important for hydrogen production, storage and transportation, whether by converting natural gas into hydrogen or through electrolysis, using offshore wind-generated energy.</p>
