      <h1>Morris, Sargent braces lead U.S. past Cuba</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sportsmax.tv/index.php/studentwriters/itemlist/user/803-paulandrewalker" target="_blank">Paul-Andre Walker</a></address>
      <p>The United States confirmed its place in the summer 2020 Concacaf Nations League Final Four with a 4-0 victory over Cuba at the Truman Bodden Sports Complex in George Town, Cayman Islands putting the U.S. atop Group A of League A.</p>
      <p>U.S. forwards Jordan Morris and Josh Sargent each had a double with the Americans facing little resistance from a Cuba side that moves down to League B after failing to pick up a point in the competition.</p>
      <p>Sargent put the United States ahead after 40 seconds, knocking home a low cross as he fell to the ground. Morris doubled the lead with a nice first touch off an assist from Weston McKennie setting up a powerful right-footed shot in the 26th minute.</p>
      <p>It was three before the half, with Aaron Long chipping up a ball that fell to him after a failed clearance of a corner kick for Morris to deflect into the box.</p>
      <p>And the cherry was on top in the 66th minute with Reggie Cannon crossing to the back post for Tyler Boyd. Boyd used his back heel in the air to keep the ball in play with Sargent finding the back of the net.</p>
