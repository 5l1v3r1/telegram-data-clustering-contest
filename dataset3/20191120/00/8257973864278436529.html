      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- After an extended absence due to a toe injury, the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_England_Patriots/?tps=1">New England Patriots</a> activated starting offensive lineman Isaiah Wynn from injured reserve.</p>
      <p>The Patriots <a href="https://www.patriots.com/news/patriots-activate-ol-isaiah-wynn-place-wr-gunner-olszewski-on-ir">announced</a> the move Tuesday. The team placed wide receiver and return specialist Gunner Olszewski on IR in a corresponding roster move.</p>
      <p>New England originally selected Wynn in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft out of Georgia. He spent his rookie season on injured reserve with a torn Achilles that he sustained in the preseason.</p>
      <p>With Wynn sitting out the entire 2018-19 campaign, he learned from veteran offensive lineman Trent Brown and Patriots offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia. Brown joined the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Oakland-Raiders/?tps=1">Oakland Raiders</a> in free agency this past off-season, pushing Wynn into the starting lineup this season.</p>
      <p>Wynn, 23, started at left tackle in the Patriots' first two games of the season before suffering his toe injury against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Miami-Dolphins/?tps=1">Miami Dolphins</a> on Sept. 15. He was subsequently placed on injured reserve Sept. 17.</p>

      <p>The return of Wynn will provide a needed boost to the Patriots' offensive line. Veteran tackle <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Marshall-Newhouse/?tps=1">Marshall Newhouse</a>, who has served as Wynn's temporary replacement, ranks 113th among all offensive linemen in the league with a 63.4 pass-blocking grade, according to <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/marshall-newhouse/5692">Pro Football Focus</a>.</p>
      <p>Newhouse also ranks 161st in pressure percentage and has a run-blocking grade of 51.2, which puts him at 74th among all tackles in the NFL with at least 100 snaps played, according to PFF.</p>
      <p>The Patriots (9-1) will host the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Dallas-Cowboys/?tps=1">Dallas Cowboys</a> (6-4) on Sunday before taking on the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Houston-Texans/?tps=1">Houston Texans</a> on Dec. 1.</p>
