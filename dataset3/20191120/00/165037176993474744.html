      <p>Tottenham have agreed a deal with Lille to bring in coaches <b>Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos</b> to work with <b>Jose Mourinho</b>.</p>
      <p>Former <b>Chelsea and Manchester United</b> boss Mourinho was appointed Spurs' new head coach on Wednesday following Mauricio Pochettino's departure the previous day.</p>
      <p>Spurs moved quickly to begin securing the desired backroom setup for their new coach, as Lille confirmed the departure of Sacramento and Santos.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have reportedly paid Â£3million for the duo, with Sacramento expected to become Mourinho's assistant. Santos joins as goalkeeping coach.</p>
      <p>"To Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos, LOSC wish all the success in this new project," a Lille statement read.</p>

      <p>ESPN report Spurs may yet return to Lille for sporting director <b>Luis Campos</b>, who previously worked with Mourinho at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's time at Tottenham saw numerous reports of tensions between the manager and chairman <b>Daniel Levy over transfers.</b></p>
      <p>The arrival of Campos as sporting director would seemingly act as a buffer, and Mourinho is said to <b>have funds to make signings in January</b>.</p>
