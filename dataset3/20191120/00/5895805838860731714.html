        <i>Hola, saludos desde Buenos Aires, Argentina.</i>
      </p>
      <p>I am writing my first post for this new blog from a condo in the beautiful Palermo neighborhood, where my family and I will be spending the next month or so. I don’t always live in Argentina. In fact, I don’t live anywhere really. I haven’t had a permanent residence for the past four years. My partner Sarah and I travel for a living and when we aren’t working, well, we travel some more. Technically, we are homeless but we like to describe ourselves as nomads or gypsies. It is a lifestyle that suits us, although I imagine most people would experience a great deal of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> over just imagining the prospect of living like this.</p>
      <p>And that brings me to the subject of this entry, ME. Comedians frequently open a joke by saying the phrase, “and now, a little about me,” so let me start by telling you a little about myself. I am Dr. Brian King, although I really only use my title as a stage name. I am a pretty casual guy so I usually just go by Brian. Besides, I’ve never been comfortable calling myself, “Dr. King”—that’s a name that has already been taken.</p>
      <p>As a public speaker with a doctorate in Psychology, I have been traveling the country teaching audiences about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a>, the benefits of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/humor">humor</a>, and how to manage stress for nearly a decade. These subjects are very interrelated, as managing stress is key to happiness, and humor contributes to them both. I devoted a good chunk of my life to teaching people how to overcome stress and live happier lives. I also perform stand-up comedy, an art form with the sole purpose of making people happy.</p>
      <p>I seem to have an ability to present research-based information in a humorous context, and this has been the key to my success as a speaker, and now, an author. In 2016, I published a book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2lcW9Ro">The Laughing Cure</a>, all about the physical and emotional benefits of humor and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/laughter">laughter</a>, which has been met with positive reviews and I am told has helped at least a few people become happier.</p>
      <p>When I look back on my life, of course I see things that I could have done differently, but I was always concerned about the happiness of others. In high school I was part of a peer <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/coaching">counseling</a> program, the basis of which being that a troubled student may prefer talking to another student rather than an adult in a position of authority. In college, I volunteered with an organization that helped organize and train a new generation of those student mentors. I also volunteered my time to a few charities, and worked in a home for emotionally disturbed children. When I became a public speaker, it was an opportunity to pursue something I had been interested in all my life.</p>
      <p>When I introduce myself to seminar audiences, I often start by stating that I am quite happy, and this is true. I am definitely not the happiest person I have ever met, but I am above average in this regard. I know how to take it easy. For the cover <a href="https://amzn.to/2lcW9Ro">The Laughing Cure</a>, my brother provided the following endorsement: “Brian has been unaffected by stress since I met him when he was five. I think he tapped into how to manage stress and live on his own terms at an early age.” Generally speaking, I live a pretty stress-free life and as a result I experience more emotional highs than lows. This does not mean that I have not dealt with my share of adverse events; I absolutely have. Bad things happen all the time, but what ultimately makes the difference in our lives is how we deal with those situations.</p>
      <p>With the growing field of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/positive-psychology">Positive Psychology</a>, there has been a lot of research on what makes people happy and how some are able to handle stress better than others. Certain characteristics and behaviors have been identified and somehow, I managed to grow to adulthood with a good set of skills for achieving happiness. In other words, I practice what I preach. Whether it was the gift of my genetic inheritance or the circumstances of my upbringing, I developed into someone with a very high tolerance for stress. I know how to take it easy, hence the title of my new book <a href="https://amzn.to/2O4erE6">The Art of Taking It Easy</a>.</p>
      <p>After a seminar on happiness one day, an audience member came up to me and said, “So you are happy . . . are you married?” to which I replied, “Of course not, I said I was HAPPY.”</p>
      <p>On more than one occasion, someone implied that my happiness and apparent lack of stress were a function of my being single and childless. Although it is true that I loved being unattached and only responsible for myself, there is a giant pile of research that suggests married people are happier than single people, and people with children are happier than people without. Researchers also suggest that one of the primary drivers of happiness is having a sense of purpose. For example, traveling the country helping people can, and did, provide a guy with a healthy dose of purpose. But you know what else works? Being a good partner to someone. Or being a good parent.</p>
      <p>My life has changed dramatically over the past few years. My partner, Sarah, and I began seeing each other as I was writing the manuscript. She was working in Colorado for the summer and I was still in Los Angeles trying to be famous. Despite the distance, we felt a connection so strong that we decided to take our relationship to the next level: sell most of our belongings, get rid of our homes, and travel the world together as nomads. You know, like everyone does when they fall in love. A year and a half later we were joined by our beautiful daughter, Alyssa. With a partner and a child (holy crap that’s a family!), my life is barely recognizable from its previous state.</p>
      <p>As high as my stress tolerance may be, I have never been more <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressed</a> than I am as a parent. My daughter hated me for the first six months of her life because as much as I tried, I simply could not lactate. Whenever I was home alone with her, I was a constant source of disappointment. But beyond being occasionally screamed at, on a daily basis I am concerned about her future, as I hope all parents are for their children. I am frequently plagued by worries about providing for her and doubts about if I am doing the right thing. Besides being a new source of stress, my daughter is also a source of unbelievable happiness for both Sarah and I. All my life, people had been telling me that having children changes everything. Yeah, I’d reply, I know. I had a dog.</p>
      <p>I had no idea, and there is no way anyone can know, how incredible gratifying it is to reproduce. Every time I look into my daughter’s eyes, my heart melts. Other than crying, everything she does fills me with joy. I love watching her learn, grow, and develop. Oh, and when she does cry, I want to do everything in my power to make things better. And because I know that someday she may read this, in case I say differently in the future, every diaper I have ever changed has been an absolute honor (remember that if you ever have to change mine, kid). I never anticipated how much my life would change. Before having a child, I would have never considered sharing a lollipop with another human being.</p>
      <p>Sarah and I know plenty of parents who are constantly under stress. We hear from parents of older children all the time about how difficult this period was for them. You know what? Other than a few infrequent situations it has never been that bad for us, and overall it has been spectacular. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting">Parenthood</a> is like any other life event in that how you deal with it influences how it affects you. Before Alyssa, we were both generally positive, resilient people, so it seems reasonable that we would carry those characteristics into this stage of our lives. One thing is certain, I doubt future audience members will suggest that the reason I am so happy and stress free is my lack of children.</p>
      <p>For this blog, I will be focusing heavily on stress <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/leadership">management</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/resilience">resilience</a>. Stress, as a contributor to so much mental and physical pain, is something that we absolutely need to address. If we could just get people to deal more effectively with stress, we could reduce or even eliminate a great deal of pain and suffering. In the columns to come, I will share a combination of stories and information that you will hopefully find entertaining and maybe help increase your stress management toolset. Because we can all use a little help once in a while. Even those of us who are already happy can benefit, because who can’t be happier? It’s not like you can max out on happiness.</p>
      <p>So let’s start taking it easy.</p>
