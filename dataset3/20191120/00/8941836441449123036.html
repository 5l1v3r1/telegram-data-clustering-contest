      <h1>Hedge fund Alden becomes Tribune’s largest shareholder</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Hedge fund Alden Global Capital is now the largest shareholder of Tribune Publishing, the company that owns the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and New York Daily News.</p>
      <p>Tribune says Alden, a hedge fund known for layoffs and slashing costs at newspapers it acquires, purchased the 25% stake from former Tribune chairman Michael Ferro. Tribune says it’s talking with Alden about adding two board seats.</p>
      <p>Ferro stepped down as chairman in 2018 amid sexual misconduct accusations. His time at Tribune was marked by a much-maligned company name change to “Tronc,” later reverted; the sale of the Los Angeles Times; and pushing off an unsolicited merger bid from rival Gannett.</p>
