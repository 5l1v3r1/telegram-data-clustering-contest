        <b>Mauricio Pochettino might have been honoured with a statue at another club but got sacked by Tottenham, said Peter Crouch.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham </a>striker <b>Peter Crouch</b> was "<b>flabbergasted</b>" by Spurs sacking <b>Mauricio Pochettino</b>, claiming other clubs would have rewarded him with a statue.</p>
      <p>Pochettino and his coaching staffÂ dismissed on Tuesday with Tottenham winless in their past five Premier League matches and <b>sitting 14th</b>.</p>
      <p>But the former Southampton boss led Spurs to their first Champions League final in June, overseeing <b>incredible victories against Manchester City and Ajax</b> before missing out on the trophy to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Crouch, who <b>came through Tottenham's academy and played for the club between 2009 and 2011,</b> could not believe how quickly Pochettino's achievements had been forgotten.</p>
      <p>"I'm flabbergasted by Tottenham's decision," ex-England star Crouch wrote in the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>"I know results have been poor and I understand why the top teams act when their <b>potential to qualify for the following season's Champions League is in jeopardy</b>, but it is <b>ridiculous to think Pochettino has suddenly lost his spark.</b></p>

      <p>"He led Tottenham into the Champions League final on June 1. Some clubs, who<b> aren't accustomed to that stage</b>, would build a statue for a manager who took them to the biggest game in club football.</p>
      <p>"But all Pochettino has got is his marching orders. <b>I fear it is a decision Tottenham will regret</b>."</p>
      <p>He added: "[Pochettino] was the best thing that had happened to them for 20 years. Good luck to them if they think they can find someone better.</p>
      <p>Since his statement, Jose Mourinho has replaced Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
