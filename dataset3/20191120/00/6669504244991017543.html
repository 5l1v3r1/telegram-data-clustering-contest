      <p>EDMONTON - Days after addressing Don Cherry's dismissal during a "Hockey Night in Canada" broadcast, sports broadcaster Ron MacLean says he doesn't believe his former co-host is a racist.</p>
      <p>MacLean, the long-time co-host of "Coach's Corner" with Cherry, is in Edmonton to receive an honorary doctor of laws degree at the University of Alberta.</p>
      <p>Before receiving the degree, MacLean told reporters it's been a difficult time.</p>
      <p>Sportsnet fired Cherry on Nov. 11, two days after controversial on-air comments during "Coach's Corner."</p>
      <p>The 85-year-old broadcaster made comments that many felt were critical of immigrants for not wearing Remembrance Day poppies.</p>
      <p>Cherry used the phrase, 'You people,' during the segment but later denied that he was singling out visible minorities.</p>
      <p>"You people that come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that," Cherry said on the segment. "These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price."</p>
      <p>In Saturday's address, MacLean said "Coach's Corner" is no more.</p>
      <p>"We are all hurting. I have collapsed 100 times this week, if not more," he said during the broadcast. "We are all disappointed."</p>
      <p>MacLean said he has received an email from Cherry since he spoke out Saturday.</p>
      <p>"He's upset, but we're all raw," he said Tuesday in Edmonton. "We're just going through one of the most difficult situations."</p>
      <p>MacLean said he doesn't believe Cherry is racist.</p>
      <p>"Don has started to come around ... he knows we projected an idea, an attitude or a behaviour on someone. He knows, I feel like in what I've listened to, he's trying now to admit to that.</p>
      <p>"If I have one regret, it's that when I apologized on Sunday night, I used Don's name and, if I am sitting at home watching it, that would hurt me. That might have created some resolve in Don not to apologize."</p>
