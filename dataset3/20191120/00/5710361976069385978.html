      <h1>China Drags Global Electrified-Car Sales Down for Second Month</h1>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Global sales of electrified vehicles declined for a second straight month as China’s cooling economy and the country’s move to reduce subsidies weighed on demand, SNE Research said.</p>
      <p>Sales of pure electric and hybrid vehicles fell 0.9% from a year earlier to 444,000 units in September, the battery research firm said in a statement Wednesday. About 126,000 units were sold in Europe, 113,000 in China and 64,000 in the U.S. In the first nine months, sales increased 17% to 3.74 million.</p>
      <p>A prolonged car-sales slump in China, the world’s biggest consumer of electric vehicles, is dragging down the global market. The country is reducing EV subsidies amid concerns about a bubble in the industry just as a slowing economy weighs on demand for big-ticket items such as cars.</p>
      <p>Sales of electrified vehicles measured by battery capacity fell 10.5% in September -- also the second consecutive monthly drop -- led by declines in China and the U.S., SNE Research said. Demand for pure electric cars was weak, while sales of hybrids increased, it said.</p>
      <p>In the first nine months, sale of electrified vehicles by battery capacity increased 46%.</p>
