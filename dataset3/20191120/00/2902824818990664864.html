      <p>With a bio-diaphragm speaker unit and wireless headband with AptX HD, the headphones are able to provide 24-bit hi-res audio with minimal background noise, allowing for both better performance and convenience. Alcantara material, memory foam and NAC acoustic bio-cellulose speakers make the headphones stiffer, lighter and stronger, while cancelling out degrees of distortion.</p>
