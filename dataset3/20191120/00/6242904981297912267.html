        <b>Awal Sulemana the pitch invader in the Ghana-South Africa game met his idol Thomas Partey after the Atletico Madrid star extended an invitation to him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Suleman was arrested by security officials after the incident and was held in custody for two days before granted bail last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Awal came on to the pitch in the 74th minute, holding a phone in search of Partey but was given a hot chase by the security officials and apprehended.</p>
      <p>According to the 25-year old his decision to go on to the pitch was because he wanted to have a selfie with the Atletico Madrid star.</p>
      <p>In an interview, Awal stated that he idolizes Thomas Partey and it was a dream come true for him to watch him play at the Cape Coast Stadium in Ghana’s game against South Africa which they won by 2-0.</p>
      <p>He later apologised for his actions and asked other soccer fans not to emulate his behaviour.</p>
