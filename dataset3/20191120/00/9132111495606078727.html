      <p>Member of Parliament for Kumbungu Constituency, Ras Mubarak has apologised to the leadership of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) for his endorsement of a Yes vote in the upcoming 17 December 2019 referendum and said he is “convinced that a “NO” vote is the way to go.</p>
      <p>The Kumbungu MP recanted his endorsement of a Yes vote in the forthcoming referendum over whether or not local elections should be made partisan.</p>
      <p>The opposition MP had, a few days ago, broken ranks with his party’s No vote position.</p>
      <p>However, following a comment by Minority Leader Haruna Iddrisu that rank breakers would be sanctioned by the Caucus, Mr Mubarak had a rethink of his position.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Tuesday, 19 November 2019, Mr Mubarak said: “Upon a sober reflection and advice from very distinguished senior party members, especially the parliamentary leadership, I have come to the conclusion that it is improper to deviate from my party’s official position for a NO vote in the upcoming referendum on Article 55(3) of the Constitution”.</p>
      <p>“I recognise that my personal position must be subsumed under the broader interest of the party”, he noted, adding: “I have, therefore, decided to uphold the party’s position for a NO vote on the matter”.</p>
      <p>The NDC’s Bono Regional Youth Organiser, Efo Worlanyo Tsekpo petitioned the Functional Executive Committee of the party to sanction Mr Mubarak for openly breaking ranks with its stance so as to engender discipline.</p>
      <p>However, in another statement issued on Tuesday, 19 November and signed by Mr Mubarak, the MP conveyed his “regrets” and “sincere apologies to the leadership and membership of the great Akatamanso family who may have been hurt by my previously held position in respect of the upcoming referendum on article 55 (3) of the constitution of Ghana.”</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the lawmaker noted that: “after a detailed discussion of the merits of the issues with leadership” of the NDC at a meeting to discuss his media interviews on the upcoming referendum on article 55(3) of the constitution of Ghana at the party’s national headquarters, the lawmaker is “convinced that a “NO” vote in this referendum on the current amendment is the way to go.”</p>
      <p>Mr Mubarak also added that: “The NDC is a party I grew up in and hold so dear to my heart. Once again, I offer my unreserved apology.”</p>
