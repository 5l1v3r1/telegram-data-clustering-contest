      <p>DEFENCE attorney Bert Samuels submitted to the state witness in the ongoing trial against Tesha Miller yesterday that he met his client for the first time last week.</p>
      <p>Samuels also suggested to the witness, who is being referred to as Witness One by the <b>Jamaica Observer </b>because court instructions are that all witnesses should remain anonymous, that he made up stories about knowing Miller since he was 11 years old and that he had only heard about him during the three years that he said he along with other members, including “Blackman”, were housed at a security facility.</p>
      <p>Samuels, during cross-examination, put forward to Witness One, who admitted that he was raised by the Klansman Gang, that he did not experience what he outlined in the statement he gave to the police along with his testimony.</p>
      <p>“No,” Witness One replied.</p>
      <p>“And that is why you made mistake like this, that you knew Tesha from 2004,” Samuels pressed yesterday.</p>
      <p>“I know dem from a very tender age,” said Witness One, who admitted that he was not ashamed to tell the jurors that he killed “nuff” people.</p>
      <p>“I (was) wanted from when I was 13. I was wanted for the Klansman Gang. Everything I said is the truth and I am not telling any lies,” Witness One continued.</p>
      <p>Witness One, who received a life sentence for murder and would have had to serve 16 years before being eligible for parole but got it reduced to 10 years last week Tuesday, after a plea bargain with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, told the court that he said certain things in his statement at the time and was trying to prevent an additional charge because he did not know what was coming.</p>
      <p>“You told the police that you never fire shots but you told them you killed,” Samuels asked.</p>
      <p>“Yes, at that time I mek up my mind to tackle anything that come,” Witness One replied.</p>
      <p>Samuels then suggested to the witness: “Is this court case yuh come know Tesha Miller.”</p>
      <p>“Yuh waan me tell yuh how me know him,” the witness replied.</p>
      <p>“And a Horizon yuh know bout him,” Samuels put forward to the witness.</p>
      <p>“No,” the witness replied.</p>
      <p>“And because yuh making up statement it took one year, one month and 14 days,” Samuels suggested.</p>
      <p>“If me did mek up dis story yuh woulda hear a lot more,” the witness replied.</p>
      <p>“And that is why you told the police you wasn't sure when the JUTC (Jamaica Urban Transit Company) manager was killed,” Samuels suggested.</p>
      <p>“No,” the witness replied.</p>
      <p>Samuels argued that the witness made up the story while he was at Horizon (Adult Remand Centre) and that was why it took him so long to compile the 14-page statement that took him 13 months and four days to complete.</p>
      <p>“It seems like you were there in Horizon with us,” the witness replied.</p>
      <p>“I don't like prison,” Samuels said.</p>
      <p>Samuels then asked the witness: “Remember you said Blackman shot the man and killed him. Blackman was acquitted of that.”</p>
      <p>“Dat man and Mr Miller kill out 13 a mi family. Me and dem a nuh friend,” the witness said.</p>
      <p>Samuels then asked if they became friends while he was at Horizon.</p>
      <p>Witness One, who agreed that, he, Blackman and Miller were all friends, told the court during the morning session that “all of us was one; lived as one, go down as one”.</p>
      <p>Miller is on trial for being an accessory before and after the fact in relation to the June 27, 2008 murder of then Jamaica Urban Transit Company Chairman Douglas Chambers.</p>
      <p>The trial is expected to resume on Thursday.</p>
