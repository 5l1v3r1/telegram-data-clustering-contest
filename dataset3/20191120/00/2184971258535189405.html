      <p>Just over a third of Irish adults are of normal weight, according to official statistics.</p>
      <p>While the proportion of men who were overweight and obese dropped slightly since 2017 (from 70% to 66%), overall figures show that 60% of those surveyed were found to be overweight or obese.</p>
      <p>Just 37% of adults recorded a normal weight this year.</p>
      <p>A survey for the Department of Health also found a significant drop in the number of people smoking.</p>

      <p>Health Promotion Minister Catherine Byrne said: “The levels of overweight and obesity in our population remains a great cause for concern.</p>
      <p>“While levels appear to be stabilising, there is no room for complacency.</p>
      <p>“In recent years Government has introduced evidence-based policies and a range of initiatives and actions to tackle both obesity and physical inactivity, and implementation of these remains a priority.</p>
      <p>“This year’s survey shows a small increase in the number of people meeting the guidelines on physical activity, which is encouraging.”</p>
      <p>Half of those surveyed were achieving the recommended level of physical activity.</p>
      <p>The prevalence of smoking has dropped from 23% in 2015 to 17% in 2019, which means there are now an estimated 165,000 fewer smokers than five years ago.</p>
      <p>Plain packaging with health warnings, introduced under a new law last year, was cited by 25% of smokers as a good motivation to quit.</p>
      <p>In the last year, 40% of smokers have made an attempt to quit, with health concerns being the prime motivator.</p>
      <p>Minister for Health Simon Harris said:” I welcome the findings of this year’s Healthy Ireland Survey and in particular the continued drop in the smoking rate.</p>
      <p>“This shows that our multi-pronged approach, with legislation, support for smoking cessation and policies to denormalise smoking in our society, is bearing fruit and we are heading in the right direction to being a tobacco-free Ireland.”</p>
