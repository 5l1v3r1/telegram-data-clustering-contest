      <p>CAIRO - 20 November 2019: “The Educational Hospitals Authority will complete the construction of the largest institute for the treatment of liver diseases in the Middle East in 2020,” said Chairman of the authority Mohamed Salah on Tuesday. <br/><br/>Salah added that the institute will cost about LE 780 million, stressing that it will provide the best medical service for patients. <br/><br/>Salah explained that the state pays great attention to hepatitis patients in light of the implementation of “100 Million Seha "initiative,which provides the patients with free treatment. <br/><br/>For his part, dean of the Liver Institute of the Ministry of Health Mohamed Ismail told Egypt Today that Egypt has more than 18 centers for liver transplant, which treat about 300 cases annually free of charge as part of President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s initiative to end the waiting lists. <br/><br/>He also said that the Health Insurance Authority bears the cost of these cases; the cost of one surgery amounts to LE 225,000. <br/><br/>In 2018, Egypt was launched the "largest medical campaign in the world" to detect and treat Hepatitis C virus for 50 million citizens upon President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s orders, according to a statement by Presidential Spokesperson Bassam Rady. <br/><br/>President Sisi also directed to examine 50 million people to treat Egyptians of hepatitis as well as non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension and diabetes in order to contribute to early detection of diseases and offer treatment to patients. <br/><br/>Egypt's anti-Hepatitis C initiative is considered the biggest of its kind in the whole world. <br/>In the same context, the head of the National Committee for Liver Viruses at the Ministry of Healh Wahid Dos told Egypt today that the virus has decreased to 90.000 cases annually.</p>
