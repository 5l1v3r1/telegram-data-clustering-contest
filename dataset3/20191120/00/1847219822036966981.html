        <b>The number of people who died in terrorist attacks around the world had dropped 15.2% in 2018. Nevertheless, the number of countries that are under risk of terrorist attacks has only increased since then, as reported by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) on Tuesday, 20 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>IEP’s this year’s published Global Terrorism Index (GTI) shows that when compared to 2014, when terrorist organization Islamic State had first expanded its influence in the Middle-East and 33 555 people lost their lives in terrorist attacks around the world, the number of victims had declined 50% (to 15 952) by 2018.</p>
      <p>The number of victims of terrorist attacks had declined the most in Iraq in 2018. The country had announced victory over the Islamic State last year. A major decline in the number of victims has also been observed in Somali, where the US forces have been performing air strikes against Shabaab terrorist group since 2017.</p>
      <p>For the first time since 2003, Iraq is no longer the country affected by terrorism the most, according to GTI, where terrorism is defined as application of force and violence or threats by a non-government player in an attempt to achieve political, economic, religious or social goals using fear, coercion or intimidation.</p>
      <h3>In 2018, Afghanistan was the country that suffered the most from terrorism. A total of 1 443 attacks took place there, claiming the lives of 7 379 people, as concluded in the study.</h3>
      <p>Iraq is second with 1 131 terrorist attacks last year (1 054 lives lost), and Nigeria with 562 terrorist attacks (2 040 lives lost).</p>
      <p>Syria is fourth in GTI with 131 terrorist attacks and 662 lives lost in 2018.</p>
      <h3>In Europe, where no major terrorist attacks happened in 2018, the number of deaths has declined from 200 to 62, when compared to 2017.</h3>
      <p>IEP CEO Steve Killelea says Western Europe had experienced the smallest number of terrorist attacks since 2012. One of the factors that contributed to this was that the influence of the Islamic State’s has declined considerably in Syria and Iraq.</p>
      <p>He says not a single dead registered in Western Europe last year was related to this terrorist group.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, he warns that the situation remains unstable and there are still terrorist groups active in Syria. These groups are smaller, but they sympathize with the Islamic State. This means future terrorist attacks in Europe are still possible.</p>
      <p>The study also mentions that in spite of reduced intensity of terrorist attacks, they remain widely spread.</p>
      <h3>In 2018 at least one person in 71 countries had died to terrorist attacks. This is the second largest number since the beginning of the century.</h3>
      <p>The study concludes that there has been a rapid surge of deaths caused by attacks of far-right terrorists in Western Europe, North America and Oceania. In the past five years the number of deaths from attacks performed by far-right terrorists in these regions has increased by 230%.</p>

      <p>The study mentions the attacks on two mosques in New Zealand in March 2019 as example of the spread of far-right ideology in the country in which almost no terror attacks had happened in the past.</p>
      <p>51 people were killed in the aforementioned attacks in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The study mentions that far-right terrorism is reflected in USA in different hate crimes.</p>
      <p>Still, most terrorist attacks took place in war-torn countries, the study concluded.</p>
