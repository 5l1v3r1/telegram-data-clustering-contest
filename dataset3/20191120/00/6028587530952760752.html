      <p>Last month saw the highly anticipated opening of Zambia’s newest safari lodge, <a href="https://www.chiawa.com/puku-ridge/">Puku Ridge</a>, in wildlife-rich South Luangwa.</p>

      <p>Bordered to the west by a steep escarpment, with the Luangwa River running along the eastern side, South Luangwa National Park covers a staggering 9,059 square kilometres of eastern Zambia. The southernmost of three national parks around the Luangwa River, it’s characterized by its ever-changing oxbow lagoon system, which flows into a landscape of woodland, sandy floodplain, riverine forest and grassland punctuated with giant baobab and sausage trees. The oxbow lagoons provide a life-support for a wealth of wildlife and unique species such as the Crawshay’s zebra, Thornicroft’s giraffe and Cookson’s wildebeest can only be found here.</p>
      <p>This is the extraordinary setting for Zambia’s newest luxury safari lodge, Puku Ridge. This tented camp previously existed here as a Sanctuary Retreats property, but it has now been rebuilt from the ground up by the new owners, Chichele Safaris, and Zambia’s long-running safari specialists, Chiawa Safaris.</p>

      <p>In partnership with Chichele, Chiawa Safaris has transformed the lodge to ensure it has minimal impact on the surrounding environment while still offering a luxury safari experience. Luxury Frontiers, a firm with brands such as Belmond and Aman in its portfolio, designed the new-look lodge to blend into its surroundings. Utilising materials such as lightweight bamboo composite, the firm fused natural elements with modern luxury and the integration of traditional local art. Every piece of furniture is custom designed and the work of a local photographer decorates the walls. The entire camp is now suspended above the ground and all of it operates on hydropower.</p>
      <p>You can now unwind by the terrace’s fire-pit and in the open-sided lounge, watch wildlife from a photography hide and take a dip in your villa’s private plunge pool. Each of the eight suites comes with its own deck, sun-loungers and pool, and they all feature a rooftop with four-poster bed for sleeping under the stars.</p>

      <p>The newly opened lodge lies within an especially secluded area of the national park. The terrace and all of the rooms here overlook a wildlife-rich plain and waterhole frequented by elephants, hippos, antelope and abundant birdlife.</p>
      <p>The camp naturally follows the classic safari schedule; rise early to set out on a game drive at dawn, take time out on your private deck during the hottest hours, then depart for another game drive taking you from the late afternoon sun to sun-downers in the bush and a thrilling night drive of possible porcupine, leopard and civet sightings.</p>
      <p>At Puku Ridge, guests then dine on well-executed dishes using local ingredients paired with South African wines before stargazing from the terrace of the main lodge.</p>

      <p>In South Luangwa, walking safaris are an alternative to game drives during the cooler hours of the day. Being on foot connects you with the sights, sounds and smells of the bush. This is when the experience is about being on nature’s terms, bringing to light what you otherwise wouldn’t have seen, smelt or heard, from lion tracks, insects and a bird’s call to occasional animal encounters with your feet on the ground.</p>
      <p>South Luangwa’s diverse landscape is said to have one of the greatest wildlife concentrations in Africa. Herds of elephants trundle through the mahogany forest, the park’s endemic giraffe munch on leaves growing high up in the woodland’s trees and leopards hide in the branches of sausage trees, waiting for antelope to eat the maroon flowers that have dropped to the ground below.</p>
      <p>Impala kick up dust as they run across the dry earth, watched with one eye by the lions sleeping in the day’s sun, and wild dogs roam in their tightly knit packs. Hippos wallow in the park’s lagoons and carmine bee-eaters dart between submerged trees and their riverbank nests.</p>

      <p>Chiawa Safaris knows that the privilege of being in this environment comes hand in hand with protecting the wildlife. The family-run company has pioneered a number of conservation initiatives in Zambia. Chiawa was the world’s first carbon neutral safari company and the first in Africa to have silver status meaning even guests’ domestic travel is offset.</p>
      <p>Now that Puku Ridge has opened as a part of the Chiawa Safaris collection, it will contribute to initiatives such as Conservation South Luangwa, Zambia Carnivore Project and Chipembele Wildlife Education Trust, as well as being carbon neutral itself.</p>

      <p>For Chiawa Safaris, this lodge follows on from <a href="https://www.chiawa.com/chiawa-camp/">Chiawa Camp</a> and <a href="https://www.chiawa.com/old-mondoro/">Old Mondoro</a> tented camps in Lower Zambezi National Park.</p>
      <p>The Lower Zambezi offers more water-based safari experiences. You can step aboard a riverboat for a Zambezi cruise or paddle along the channels in a two-person canoe. Here you’ll see elephants crossing as the sun goes down and navigate past hippos as they bob beneath the surface of the water. Troops of baboons watch as you glide by their resting spot in the shade of the riverbank’s trees and the mountains of the Zambezi escarpment lie on the horizon.</p>
      <p>On land, big cats are in abundance. Lion sightings are a daily occurrence as they spend their days resting with the pride and leopards can be spotted making their way through the wilderness alone.</p>

      <p>Making the journey to Puku Ridge enables you to experience South Luangwa’s wilderness with the lightest footprint possible. Combining your stay with Chiawa Camp and Old Mondoro makes for a well-rounded wildlife experience in Zambia.</p>
