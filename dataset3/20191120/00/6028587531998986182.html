      <p>A brief and potentially spectacular meteor storm may see 400 shooting stars light up the night sky on Thursday, November 21, 2019. According to experts, the obscure and usually minor Alpha Monocerotid meteor shower could produce a rare “meteor outburst” with a duration of as little as 15 minutes and as long as 40 minutes. Observers in Europe, Africa, South America and in the eastern part of the US will likely get the best view if predictions prove correct.</p>
      <p>Here’s why, as well as exactly where, when and how to see the Alpha Monocerotid meteor outburst. Just hope for clear skies ...</p>
      <h3>What is the Alpha Monocerotid meteor shower?</h3>
      <p>All meteor showers are caused by comets, which leave dust trails that Earth smashes into on its orbit around the Sun. Most of them occur annually, and the comet that causes them is known to astronomers. However, the Alpha Monocerotid meteor shower is different. Astronomer do not know its origin, though it’s suspected to be a long-period comet that orbits the Sun around once every 500 years. There exists a narrow dust trails that Earth almost never encounters, but when it does, a meteor outbursts can occur. Astronomers know that Earth has encountered this stream before, and each time it’s produced a powerful meteor shower event:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1925: 1,000 shooting stars per hour (“meteor storm”)</li>
        <li>1935: 1,000 shooting stars per hour (“meteor storm”)</li>
        <li>1985: 700 shooting stars per hour (“meteor outburst”)</li>
        <li>1995: 400 shooting stars per hour (“meteor outburst”)</li>
        <li>2019: Between 100 (“meteor outburst”) and 1,000 (“meteor storm”) shooting stars per hour are predicted</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s that “meteor outburst” of 1995 that November 21’s outburst looks set to most closely resemble.</p>
      <h3>Why is there going to be an Alpha Monocerotid ‘meteor outburst?’</h3>
      <p>The source for this prediction is a paper called <a href="https://www.meteornews.net/2019/11/06/likely-alpha-monocerotids-amo246-outburst-on-the-morning-of-november-22-2019/">“Likely Alpha Monocerotids (AMO#246) outburst on the morning of November 22, 2019</a>” on MeteorNews by Peter Jenniskens, a senior research scientist with the SETI Institute and NASA's Ames Research Center, and Esko Lyytinen of the Finnish Fireball Network. However, Bill Cooke at the NASA Meteoroid Environment Office <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/2019/11/19/about-the-upcoming-maybe-alpha-monocerotid-meteor-shower-outburst/?fbclid=IwAR2HSQ6pLQc1ubLu03N0h3HE5JBfDBRpTALk2q0BQd0ewtGpZP0tfj9apH0">has published an article</a> in response that’s a little more pessimistic.</p>
      <h3>When to look for the Alpha Monocerotid ‘meteor outburst’</h3>
      <p>The expected outburst is predicted to occur at 04:50 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on Friday, November 22, when only North and South America, Europe and Africa are in darkness (everyone in Asia or Australasia will miss out). However, the experts advise that you’re outside and looking up at 04:15 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>That translates to these times on Thursday and Friday for a sample of well-situated population centers in those regions (you should <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html">convert for your exact location and time-zone</a> and <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun">check the time of local sunrise</a>). I’ve left out locations west of Denver because the meteor outburst will take place below the horizon.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mexico City, Mexico: 10:15 p.m. CST on Thursday, November 21</li>
        <li>New York City, NY &amp; Washington DC: 11:15 p.m. EST on Thursday, November 21</li>
        <li>Santiago, Chile: 1:15 a.m. CLST on Friday, November 22</li>
        <li>São Paulo, Brazil: 1:15 a.m. BRT on Friday, November 22</li>
        <li>Buenos Aires, Argentina: 1:15 a.m. ART on Friday, November 22</li>
        <li>Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain: 4:15 a.m. WET on Friday, November 22</li>
        <li>Cardiff, Edinburgh &amp; London: 4:15 a.m. GMT on Friday, November 22</li>
        <li>Madrid, Paris &amp; Brussels: 5:15 a.m. CET on Friday, November 22</li>
        <li>Marrakech: 5:15 a.m. CET on Friday, November 22</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Anyone who is going to try to observe should not be late at all,” advise Jenniskens and Lyytinen. “The strongest maximum would fit in about 15 minutes, or maybe a little bit less. It will be almost completely over in about 40 minutes. I recommend starting the observations at the latest at 04h30m and if you don’t want to miss any meteor, then start no later than at 4h15m.”</p>

      <h3>Where to look for the Alpha Monocerotid ‘meteor outburst?’</h3>
      <p>Like all meteor showers, this one gets its name from its apparent radiant point in the constellation of Monoceros, the Unicorn, which is close to the bright star Procyon in Canis Minor. More generally, the more famous constellations of Orion and Gemini is where to face. Although the shooting stars won't really come from there—they will just appear to do so—it’s best to look in that general direction.</p>
      <p>Since more shooting stars will be visible the higher Monoceros is in the night sky, it’s Europe that has the best view, followed by the east coast of North America and South America. For the west coast of the U.S., Monoceros will be very low on the horizon.</p>

      <p>If it’s a clear night, here’s how to find shooting stars from the Alpha Monocerotids “meteor outburst” (though shooting stars can occur anywhere in the night sky):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Find as dark a sky as possible. </b>Preferably away from a city, but if you’re in an urban area, stand in the shadow of a building if you can. Make sure there’s no bright light in your field of view.</li>
        <li><b>Go outside 20 minutes before</b> the Alpha Monocerotids “meteor outburst” is due to begin, to get your night vision in time for the shooting stars.</li>
        <li><b>Look generally to the southeast.</b> Try to pick-out Orion’s Belt, which from North America will be east/southeast and from Europe will be in the southwest. Now range your eyes slightly to the east.</li>
        <li><b>Keep looking, be patient.</b> Don’t look at your smartphone, which will instantly kill your night vision, which takes 20 minutes. Only those that stand outside for an hour will see it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you miss the Alpha Monocerotids “meteor outburst,” Jenniskens and Lyytinen predict that the next one—set to be a full-blown meteor storm—will be in 2043.</p>
