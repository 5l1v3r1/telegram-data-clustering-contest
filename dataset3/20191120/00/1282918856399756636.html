      <p>Higher the qualification, higher is the success? This theory is often proven wrong by those who went on to achieve massive success in their fields, despite being not being overly qualified. Internationally, Microsoft founder Bill Gates often makes it to the list of most successful ‘dropouts’. In India, many sportspersons and film stars have proved that educational qualifications aren’t proportional to success. One such film star who went on to achive success as a politician is Smriti Irani. The Union Minister connected with this similarity with Bill Gates when there were snapped together. As Smriti quipped about what they should do, going forward, her close friend and indsustry mentor Ekta Kapoor jokingly suggested that she should return as Tulsi on their serial <i>Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.</i></p>

Tulsi kyunki abh bhi yaaa hai......pls waaapsi Karein 😂” (Kyunki... is still remembered, please return as Tulsi).</p>
