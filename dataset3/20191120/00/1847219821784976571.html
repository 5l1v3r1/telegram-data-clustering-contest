        <b>In the event of a threat to the state, supplying Latvian residents with food would cost the state budget approximately EUR 12 million per day, according to estimates from Agriculture Ministry, which were performed in line with adoption of a comprehensive state security system.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ministry explains that it performs in-depth assessment of all sectors under its responsibility based on guidelines developed by Defence Ministry. Results and conclusions will lay in the foundation of the State Protection concept the Defence Ministry plans to develop in 2020.</p>
      <h3>The ministry reminds that the goal of the comprehensive state protection system is ensuring protection of all state sectors and preparedness for overcoming crises, including in the event of military conflicts.</h3>
      <p>Its adoption and costs have to be planned in a de-centralized way – through agreement and cooperation between different state institutions. The process will be coordinated by Defence Ministry by providing each state institution with specific objectives and role in protection of the state.</p>
      <p>For its part, Agriculture Ministry performs evaluation of its sector, analyses the situation and identifies matters that need improving.</p>
      <p>Agriculture Ministry also plans to optimize requirements of the Cabinet of Ministers on food range available to residents in the event of state threats, primarily focusing on the products the national economy is able to supply. This mainly means products that can be prepared quickly and have a good shelf life. The ministry has developed amendments to relevant requirements of the Cabinet of Ministers. It is planned to submit amendments for inter-institutional coordination soon.</p>
      <p>The ministry’s developed rules project provides for adopting normalized food supply with basic products in the event of state threat. For example, residents will be provided with cereal flakes, flour, porridge, pasta, canned food, rusks, drinking water and other quickly prepared products with a long shelf life. Discussions about the full list of products will continue.</p>
      <h3>The ministry explains there are 2% of residents under state care. In the event of a crisis situation they have to be supplied with food.</h3>
      <p>However, the ministry has performed not only estimates of the costs of supplying residents with a minimum of necessary amount of food, as well as costs of supply of food for all of Latvia’s residents. According to the ministry’s estimates, supply of food products to all Latvian residents would cost the state budget about EUR 12 million per day.</p>
      <p>Agriculture Ministry adds that the comprehensive state protection system also provides for involvement of producers. This is why there are plans to consult with food industry representatives to reach an agreement on food supplies in crisis situations. Food producers have been contacted. If need be, they could provide food supplies to residents.</p>
      <p>The ministry adds that current requirements of the Cabinet of Ministers provide that food supplies in the event of a crisis should be organized using delayed deliveries. However, the current situation with delayed deliveries shows that with limited budget accessibility it would be necessary to reach an agreement on a different approach to food supplies in a crisis situation.</p>
