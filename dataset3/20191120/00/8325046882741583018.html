        <li>YouTuber Gabbie Hanna issued <a href="https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1196222725410316288">an apology</a> addressing parts of a drama centering around her, former Vine stars, and messaging fans with screenshots of private texts.</li>
        <li>Previously, YouTuber Trisha Paytas accused Hanna of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSSDVBAZBFs">harassing and slandering</a> her and has since threatened to take out a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybbN6ptXpNY">restraining order</a> against her, stemming from an incident in which Hanna told Paytas’ then-boyfriend Jason Nash that Paytas had herpes – which Paytas says is untrue.</li>
        <li>Then, a <a href="https://twitter.com/deanime_/status/1193995943693242376">fan tweeted</a> that “a lot of people forget or don’t know that Gabbie Hanna chose a rapist […] over her then best friend, who was the victim,” referring to when former Vine star Curtis Lepore <a href="https://observer.com/2014/02/vine-star-curtis-lepore-takes-plea-deal-in-rape-case-is-a-major-dick-about-it/">plead guilty</a> to felony assault of fellow Vine star Jessi Vasquez, better known as Jessi Smiles, who accused him of raping her.</li>
        <li>Hanna messaged the fan, named Deanna, and told her that any accusation that she sided with Lepore over Vasquez was fabricated. Deanna tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/deanime_/status/1194462560042602496">an apology</a>, which caught the attention of Jen Dent, another former Vine star and friend of Vasquez. Dent reached out to Deanna and connected her with Vasquez.</li>
        <li>Vasquez then made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbO_X_15lqE&amp;amp;t=12s">a video</a> about Hanna sending screenshots of private text messages between Dent and Hanna and Vasquez and Hanna to Deanna. She said Hanna had spent time with Lepore’s friends after he was prosecuted and that Hanna told Vasquez “Curtis’ friends didn’t rape you” when Vasquez expressed that she felt betrayed.</li>
        <li>Before apologizing, Hanna began sending more Twitter DMs to a 15-year-old fan explaining why she had yet to address the accusations that she had sided with a rapist.</li>

      <p>A convoluted drama has enveloped several of YouTube’s biggest stars, along with some former Vine stars, resulting in Gabbie Hanna issuing <a href="https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1196222725410316288">an apology</a> for sending fans screenshots of private texts.</p>
      <p>In addition to sending DMs to a fan <a href="https://twitter.com/deanime_/status/1193995943693242376">who tweeted</a> that Hanna had sided with “a rapist […] over her then best friend, who was the victim,” Hanna, 28, also sent numerous DMs to a 15-year-old fan concerning her support of Curtis Lepore, who <a href="https://observer.com/2014/02/vine-star-curtis-lepore-takes-plea-deal-in-rape-case-is-a-major-dick-about-it/">plead guilty</a> to felony assault of his then-girlfriend Jessi Vasquez (known online as Jessi Smiles).</p>
      <p>Hanna didn’t address her conversation with her underage fan in her apology, and she went back to posting her regular content soon afterward – in the meantime, threats of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybbN6ptXpNY">restraining order</a> from YouTuber Trisha Paytas still linger after the conflict that started it all continues to die down.</p>

      <p>A few days before Hanna became wrapped up in a social media drama that just won’t end, she <a href="https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1191392145115975681">tweeted that</a> she hoped to have a scandal soon because her “views are down.” The resulting series of feuds did increase her view count, but it also lost her <a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/thegabbieshow">more than</a> 70,000 YouTube subscribers in the process, according to SocialBlade.</p>
      <h3>Drama first erupted on November 9, when Paytas uploaded a video addressing a conflict between her, Hanna, and YouTuber Gabi Demartino</h3>
      <p>The conflict between Hanna and Paytas, 31, started on Hanna’s Instagram stories. The original stories are included in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybbN6ptXpNY">Sebastian Williams’ video</a> about Paytas’ threat of a restraining order.</p>
      <p>Hanna asked her Instagram followers if it was wrong to tell a friend that the person they were in a sexual relationship with had an “incurable STD,” if a close friend of the person with the sexually-transmitted disease had told you first. Hanna didn’t use names, but as Paytas’ video would explain, it was about her.</p>
      <p>In her video “WHY I DON’T TRUST GABBIE HANNA,” Paytas said that Hanna had previously texted Paytas’ then-boyfriend Jason Nash and told him that she heard Paytas had herpes. Paytas says she has never had herpes.</p>
      <p>Hanna defended her actions on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1193370791762710533">by saying</a> “it wasn’t my business to know if trisha had herpes, i have no reason for her to tell me. it WAS my business to warn a friend that he might be at risk. know what i mean? asking her would just be gossip. telling him to be safe and find out is caring for his health. [sic]”</p>

      <p>As Paytas explains in her video, the drama continued because Paytas spent the week preceding her video with another YouTuber, Gabi Demartino, who is friends with Hanna. While working on content together, Paytas says she told Demartino, 24, that she doesn’t like Hanna. After Paytas left, Hanna texted Demartino and asked if Paytas had talked about her.</p>
      <p>Demartino, who has since apologized for lying, told Hanna that Paytas had heard Hanna didn’t like her (Paytas). Paytas says this resulted in Hanna harassing her with text messages, resulting in the first video she uploaded.</p>
      <p>In since-deleted tweets, Hanna accused Paytas of blackmailing Demartino, and in an email shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybbN6ptXpNY">with Sebastian Williams</a>, Paytas appears to tell her lawyers that she needs “a restraining order ASAP or some sort of protection from someone slandering my name.”</p>
      <p>The resulting back-and-forth has since calmed down, Demartino told Insider. She says she and Paytas have “made up” and that she is still friends with Hanna.</p>
      <p>“Both girls respect my mistake and feel sorry for putting me in the middle. Both women are trying to move forward from the situation,” Demartino said in an email. The end of the Hanna-Paytas-Demartino conflict sparked another.</p>
      <h3>Hanna began DM-ing a fan who tweeted about her “choosing” Lepore over Vasquez, who accused him of raping her</h3>
      <p>In the midst of the Hanna-Paytas-Demartino drama, a former fan of Hanna’s named Deanna tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/deanime_/status/1193995943693242376">an unrelated addition</a> that caught Hanna’s attention.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of people forget or don’t know that Gabbie Hanna chose a rapist […] over her then best friend, who was the victim,” Deanna said, referring to Vasquez and Hanna, who used to live together and create content together, and Lepore.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/deanime_/status/1193995943693242376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Hanna saw the tweet, and began DM-ing Deanna about it. Hanna told her that there were no tweets she issued in support of Lepore, and that she never created content with him. Hanna said that any tweets that had ever existed would be on the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>, an internet archive.</p>
      <p>Specifically, Hanna said that “you can check anything that’s ever been on the internet on the way back machine” – which isn’t true, and none of Hanna’s old tweets from when her handle was @thegabbieshow (it’s now @gabbiehanna) appear cataloged on the website.</p>
      <p>Deanna was convinced she had erred, and tweeted an apology, which caught the attention of former Vine star Jen Dent. Dent used to be friends with Hanna and is still friends with Vasquez. She tweeted her <a href="https://twitter.com/JentotheDen/status/1196146894394843137">own screenshots</a> of replies to deleted tweets from Hanna’s account that appear to show Hanna interacting with Lepore after the point she maintains she no longer interacted with him either online or in person.</p>
      <p>In addition, Dent told Insider that she reached out to Deanna and put her in contact with Vasquez. In addition to denying what Deanna said in her tweet, Hanna also sent Deanna screenshots of private texts between her and Vasquez.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbO_X_15lqE&amp;amp;t=12s">Vasquez’s video</a>, she says Hanna also spent time with Lepore’s friends after he was prosecuted, and that when Vasquez expressed that she felt betrayed, Hanna said “Curtis’ friends didn’t rape you.” In her apology, Hanna says she can’t confirm or deny that she said so, because she says she doesn’t remember.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XbO_X_15lqE" width="480" height="270" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>

      <p>“Jessi was very careful with her video. It took her a long time to film it and put it up,” Dent told Insider. “All I can say is that it has been building up for five years and it was time for this to happen.”</p>
      <h3>Before issuing an apology, Hanna started DM-ing a 15-year-old fan about the conflict, sparking more outrage</h3>
      <p>Deanna told Insider that she agreed to be a part of Vasquez’s video because she realized that Hanna was being manipulative.</p>
      <p>“Jessi reached out to me to apologize and when she did and was so kind, I looked back and was like, “Wow, wait a minute,” Deanna said. In the meantime, Hanna began <a href="https://twitter.com/abikathryn/status/1196209077761822728">sending Twitter DMs</a> to a 15-year-old fan who tweeted at her asking to respond to the situation.</p>
      <p>Hanna told the fan she hadn’t watched Vasquez’s video yet and asked her to explain what Vasquez said about her. When the fan told Hanna about the “Curtis’ friends didn’t rape you” comment, Hanna said being friends with Vasquez at the time of Lepore’s prosecution was isolating.</p>
      <p>“i don’t remember saying it so it’s hard to say why i said it, but if i had to guess it would be bc i completely isolated myself for a year to be friends w jessi bc no one wanted anything to do w the rape drama and everyone sided w him, and i sided w her [sic],” Hanna wrote. “i prob just snapped bc i was lonely and tired of being told who i could and could not hang out w [sic]”</p>
      <p>Once the 15-year-old fan posted the screenshots of Hanna’s DMs with her, Vasquez responded on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I made it very clear in my video that this behavior needs to stop,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jessismiles__/status/1196223857931087872">she wrote</a>. “@gabbiehanna, STOP messaging fans. Especially 15 year old ones. This fan is now being brought into something she had no business being involved in. Enough is enough.”</p>
      <p>Shortly afterward, Hanna posted her apology, and resumed posting her normal content. She addressed her DMs with Deanna, but not her underage fan.</p>
      <p>“I should have stopped there, but if I’m being honest, I just felt a closeness to her and felt I could vent,” Hanna wrote. “I feel like, especially right now, I’m constantly under fire for something and do feel misrepresented a lot. I don’t like to engage in drama, so I’ve never gotten to tell my side of this before.”</p>
