Based in Berlin, Cardini continues travelling all around the world, making people dance, and even extend support to the LGBT community.<br/><br/>Anushka<br/>Anushka, one of India’s leading fashion and beauty photographers, always had an appetite for experimental sounds. And so, in early 2015, she got together with her friend Smita (aka Agent) and started ANU$HKA + AGENT. Within a year, the duo was playing fests such as VH1 Supersonic and Bass Camp, they opened for ARCA at the Gucci WOM Night, and they even did informal sets on the Cheeky Iguana at the Burning Man Festival.<br/><br/>Shri <br/>With years of formal training in Carnatic music, her ability to blend classical and contemporary vocal elements in both live and studio settings gave form to her band Gods Robots. And being the indie singer/songwriter that she is, she extensively collaborates with electronic music producers from across the world. <br/><br/>Noni Mouse<br/><br/>Her real name is Radhapriya, and she is famous for blending elements of thick soundscapes, eerie percussion lines, and R&amp;B vocals in her sets, often creating ambient-pop anthems that stick to people like glue. Her track Deadpan in Van was featured on the all-women Jwala compilation titled Now, her track BFF was a part of Azadi Records x She Said So’s Women Day Compilation, and her latest EP is a take on contemporary pop music, with hooky motifs made of detailed, unexpected arrangements. It’s called noni-pop. So apt. <br/><br/>Attend the FiveSixZero music summit and fest from November 22 to 24, at The Lalit Ashok, Kumarakrupa Road, tickets on bookmyshow.com, details on fivesixzero.in<br/></i><br/><br/><b>To feature an event on this page, send the details and photographs to mybangaloremirror@timesgroup.com with the subject line ‘Unwind’</b></p>
