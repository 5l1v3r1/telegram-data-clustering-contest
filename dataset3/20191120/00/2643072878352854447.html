      <h3>APC Replies Seriake Dickson Over Bayelsa Polls</h3>
      <p>The <b>All Progressives Congress</b> (APC) has countered the claims by <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/seriake-dickson/"><u><b>Governor Seriake Dickson</b></u></a> that it rigged the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>In its response, the APC attributed the victory of the APC in last Saturday’s election to the failure of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), further accusing it of fielding an unpopular candidate in the person of <b>Senator Douye Diri</b> as its candidate for the polls.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports the APC made this submission <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/20/dickson-reveals-what-apc-did-to-jonathan-to-win-bayelsa-governorship-election/"><u>in reaction to initial claims</u></a></b> by Gov. Dickson that the party massively rigged the Bayelsa governorship election for its candidate and eventual winner, David Lyon.</p>
      <p>The Bayelsa State APC chairman <b>Mr. Jothan Amos</b>, in a statement on Wednesday, said his party won freely and squarely in Saturday’s election.</p>
      <p>Amos said the arrogant attitude of Gov. Dickson in events leading up to the election made the victory easier for the APC.</p>
      <p>The APC chairman also noted that the people of the State decided to put an end to the tyrannical reign of Dickson and the PDP by voting for the APC candidate.</p>
      <p>He said, <i>“the PDP lost the election because of the attitude of Dickson. The manner he insulted and disrespected the people of the state, especially elders, is unprecedented. He has insulted everybody in Bayelsa, including former president of Nigeria, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“If Dickson has insulted the likes of Dr. Goodluck who picked him from nowhere and made him governor, then nobody should be surprised that he is bracingly accusing the Presidency and the INEC of complicity when he knows that the right thing to do at this point is to head to the Election Petition Tribunal if at all he has a case.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“What happened in the just concluded election was the manifestation of the will of the people who wanted to be librated from the bondage Dickson subjected the to. They simply expressed the fact that they were tired of darkness, underdevelopment, non-payment of salaries, too many abandoned projects, dilapidated schools, insecurity and misappropriation of public funds.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The people expressed their disappointment in the PDP led government at the polls, this was done without any form of financial inducements. If at all Dickson has learnt to receive wise cancel, I would suggest he rather start offsetting the many debt he owes Bayelsa civil servants and not to continue to make comments that would bridge the existing peace Bayelsans currently enjoy.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He should start preparing his hand-over note because the battle is lost. In spite of the fact that he has failed to congratulate our governor-elect, Chief David Lyon, the people are happy about the way the election turned out. Go to the streets of Yenagoa, you would see people celebrating the victory of our party. And the APC is more focused on how to bring the needed change the people desire, and not to pay attention to hate speeches of Dickson.”</i>
