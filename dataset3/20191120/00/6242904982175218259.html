      <p>Polley, son of former Ghana international Prince Polley, is saddened by the defeat to the Ivorians but has urged his teammates and Ghanaian to keep their hopes alive for Friday's clash.</p>
      <p>“Full bag of experience I take it with me for the journey. Sad that I still not have prove the player I am it takes time. As team we lost a battle but not a war Friday we have the chance to still get the tickets to Tokyo so don’t lose hope,” Robin Polley posted after the game.</p>
