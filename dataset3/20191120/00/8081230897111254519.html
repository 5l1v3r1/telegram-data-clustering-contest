      <p>Two Aurora, Ill. police officers shot in the line of duty during the <a href="https://www.wwdmag.com/henryprattshooting">Henry Pratt mass shooting</a> are returning to full duty after nine months of recovery.</p>
      <p>“Today is a good day,” said Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman <a href="https://www.aurora-il.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=317">in a news release</a> from the Aurora Police Department.</p>
      <p>Officer Adam Miller was shot in the face confronting <a href="https://www.wwdmag.com/aurora-police-identify-victims-shooting-henry-pratt-co-release-photo-shooter">the shooter</a>. He was heard over the police radio saying, "I'm shot – still in the fight." Miller returned to full duty Nov. 11, <a href="https://www.kcchronicle.com/2019/11/12/two-aurora-police-officers-shot-in-deadly-henry-pratt-shooting-return-to-full-duty/aoyvi11/">according to the Kane County Chronicle</a>.</p>
      <p>“His resilience and fighting spirit have been an inspiration to us all,” <a href="https://www.aurora-il.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=317">said Ziman in the release</a>. “On behalf of a grateful police department, thank you for the love and support you have given our officers as they have fought their way back to wellness.”</p>
      <p>The shooting left five Henry Pratt employees dead and several Aurora police officers wounded. </p>
      <p>Officer Rey Rivera also returned to full duty. He was shot in the leg during the incident and has undergone nine months of physical therapy to regain full use of his leg. </p>
      <p>Officer James Zegar has also returned to full duty shortly after the shooting, <a href="https://www.kcchronicle.com/2019/11/12/two-aurora-police-officers-shot-in-deadly-henry-pratt-shooting-return-to-full-duty/aoyvi11/">reported the Kane County Chronicle</a>. Officer John Cebulski and Officer Marco Gomez are continuing the recovery process and are currently on restrictive duty assignments.</p>
      <p>“It’s really amazing how we have become closer as a police department,” <a href="https://wgntv.com/2019/08/13/6-months-after-henry-pratt-company-shooting-aurora-continues-to-heal/">Gomez said to WGN News</a>. “How closer I am with my family. How close the community is with the police and how close the community is with each other. And I think it’s a credit to the community. When something bad happens, you’re going to either fall or rise up. And they’ve risen up. It’s just better.”</p>
      <p>Among those killed in the shooting was Trevor Wehner, a human resources intern at Henry Pratt. Also killed were Josh Pinkard, Clayton Parks, Russell Beyer, and Vicente Juarez. </p>
