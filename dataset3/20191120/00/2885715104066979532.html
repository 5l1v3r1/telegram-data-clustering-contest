      <h2>The decline in gross NPAs of banks had come after banks reported an 18.9 per cent rise in bad loans to over Rs 10 lakh crore during the second quarter of last year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:17:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/george-mathew/" target="_blank">George Mathew</a></address>
      <p>The banking sector, led by public sector banks, has seen a 7.5 per cent fall in bad loans, or gross non-performing assets (NPAs) from Rs 9,92,964 crore in the second quarter of last year to Rs 9,18,487 crore in September 2019 as they managed to achieve a considerable reduction in loan slippages and boost recoveries.</p>
      <p>PSBs managed to bring down their bad loans by about Rs 80,000 crore during the 12-month period ended September 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>Significantly, PSBs registered a contraction in their gross NPA amount by 10 per cent and stood at Rs 7,27,296 crore for Q2FY20, compared to Rs 8,07,937 crore in Q2FY19, as per a study by Care Ratings.</p>
      <p>The decline in gross NPAs of banks had come after banks reported an 18.9 per cent rise in bad loans to over Rs 10 lakh crore during the second quarter of last year.</p>
      <p>State Bank of India reported a Rs 44,000-crore decline in gross NPAs to Rs 1,61,636 crore (7.19 per cent of advances) from Rs 2,05,864 crore (9.95 per cent) a year ago.</p>
      <p>However, banks are worried over bad loans rising again as crisis-ridden DHFL, the telecom and power sectors are likely to add to their bad loan woes in the coming quarters. Many banks, including SBI, have already indicated that they would soon classify DHFL, which owes close to Rs 1 lakh crore to banks, as NPA.</p>
      <p>“It is difficult to assess the impact of the Supreme Court judgment on average gross revenue issue, involving a payout of over Rs 92,000 crore to the government, he said,” SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said.</p>
      <p>“We have decided not to take any more exposure in telecom and power,” said the CEO of a nationalised bank.</p>
      <p>“PSU banks recorded an 18.4 per cent rise in their gross NPAs amount during the second quarter of last year. The GNPA ratio for the PSU banks stood at 11.6 per cent for the quarter under review as against 13.5 per cent in Q2 of last year,” Care Ratings said. PSBs have been seeing a marked decline in their stressed assets over the past couple of quarters amid sustained initiatives to arrest fresh slippages and recoveries.</p>
      <p>However, private banks posted a rise in NPAs with the Reserve Bank of India getting tough on under-reporting of NPAs, Care Ratings said. Gross NPA amount of private banks rose by over Rs 6,000 crore — from Rs 1,85,027 crore during Q2FY19 to Rs 1,91,191 crore in Q2FY20, a rise of 3.3 per cent. The GNPA ratio for private banks, however, witnessed a slight moderation from 5.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent in the September quarter. “Private banks with greater exposure to corporate loans are now in the process of recognising their stressed assets,” it said.</p>
      <p>The considerable improvement in the asset quality of the banking sector has led to a decline in the provisions made by most banks. The provisions against stressed assets have contracted for banks from Rs 70,458 crore in Q2 FY19 to Rs 62,754 crore in Q2 FY20, a decline of 10.9 per cent. PSBs recorded a contraction in their provisions to the tune of 15.6 per cent during the quarter as against a growth of 1.5 per cent during Q2FY19, Care Ratings said.</p>
      <p>The growth in the provisions by private banks has moderated considerably from 28.7 per cent recorded last year to 1.5 per cent in Q2FY20. The growth in provisions has come on account of rise in the recognition of stressed assets by the private banks.</p>
      <p>While the asset quality of PSBs have improved, they recorded a net loss of Rs 727 crore in the September quarter, down from the steep loss of Rs 11,114 crore in the year-ago period. PSBs recorded a net profit in Q1FY20. The net profit of the private sector banks recorded a marginal decline in Q2FY20 on account of changes in the deferred tax rate.</p>
      <p>Overall, the aggregate net profit of all commercial banks during the September quarter improved on account of lower provisioning and the steady rise in interest income augmented by considerable growth in other income.<br/>The sector recorded a net profit of Rs 6,348 crore during Q2FY20 as against net loss of Rs 3,918 crore in the same period previous year.</p>
