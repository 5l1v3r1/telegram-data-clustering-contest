      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Ambassador <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Gordon Sondland</a> says a July cellphone call with President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> “primarily discussed” rapper A$AP Rocky, who was imprisoned in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sweden/">Sweden</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> told a House impeachment inquiry into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> on Wednesday that testimony from U.S. diplomat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-holmes/">David Holmes</a> had jogged his memory of the discussion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> says his July 26 call with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> from a Kyiv restaurant mainly focused on the rapper, instead of Ukraine military aid. At the time, the rapper was in a Swedish jail awaiting trial on charges stemming from a June 30 street brawl in Stockholm.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-holmes/">Holmes</a> previously testified behind closed doors that he overhead <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Sondland</a> tell <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> that the president should let Rocky “get sentenced, play the racism card, and give him a ticker-tape when he comes home.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> publicly weighed in to support the Grammy-nominated rapper, who pleaded self-defense. The rapper, along with his two bodyguards, on Aug. 14 were given “conditional sentences,” meaning they wouldn’t serve prison time unless they commit a similar offense the in the future.</p>
