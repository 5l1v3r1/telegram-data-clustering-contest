      <p>Investing.com – Here's a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.</p>
      <h3>1. Data Deluge: Jobless Claims, Philly Fed, Housing</h3>
      <p>The Labor Department at 08:30AM ET (13:30GMT) releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Nov. 16.</p>
      <p>Economists forecast that <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/initial-jobless-claims-294">initial jobless claims</a> fell to 219,000 from 225,000 previously.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve will release its measure of manufacturing activity in the region.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/philadelphia-fed-manufacturing-index-236">Philly Fed index</a> is expected to rise to a reading of 7.0 from 5.6 last month.</p>
      <p>The latest data on <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/existing-home-sales-99">pending home sales</a>, meanwhile, is slated for 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT).</p>
      <p>On average, economists predict that pending home sales rebounded in October, rising 1.4%, to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.47 million units, compared with a 2.2% decline in the previous month.</p>
      <h3>2. Splunk Earnings Due</h3>
      <p>Splunk (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/splunk-inc">SPLK</a>) is slated to report earnings after the closing bell, with analysts keen for signs on whether its transition to a subscription-based cloud model has continued to keep a lid on cash flows.</p>
      <p>The data analytics firm is <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/splunk-inc-earnings">expected to report</a> earnings of 54 cents on revenue of 604.23 million.</p>
      <p>Splunk said it expects third-quarter revenue of about $600 million, and full-year revenue of about $2.3 billion, up from a previous forecast of about $2.25 billion.</p>
      <h3>3. Macy's and Nordstrom Continue Retail Earnings Parade</h3>
      <p>Macy’s (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/macys">M</a>) is expected to report <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/macys-earnings">third-quarter earnings</a> of 1 cent on revenue of $5.33 billion before the market opens. A year ago, the retail giant reported earnings of 27 cents a share on revenue of $5.4 billion.</p>
      <p>Sentiment on the retailer ahead of its results is far from positive after it recently cut its outlook on growth, forecasting earnings for the year in a range of $2.85 to $3.05 a share.</p>
      <p>In the second quarter, the retailer’s results fell short of estimates and there are few holding out for improved performance amid pressure from e-commerce competition and higher costs resulting from the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
      <p>Nordstrom (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/nordstrom-inc">JWN</a>), meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/nordstrom-inc-earnings">expected to report</a> earnings of 64 cents on revenue of $3.67 billion after the closing bell.</p>
      <p>Performance in its off-price Rack stores, which accounts for roughly a third of Nordstrom’s total sales, is touted to rebound in the third quarter after sales dropped 1.9% in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>“We look for slight upside to consensus for 3Q results at Nordstrom (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/nordstrom-inc">JWN</a>), driven mostly by strength at Rack, where we are seeing notable improvement in traffic and revenue correlated search interest data,” Wedbush said in a note to clients.</p>
      <p>The retailer said it expected net sales guidance to decline by 2% for 2019, compared with previous guidance in the range of 0% to a 2% decline.</p>
