      <p>My holiday snacking is about to get a major upgrade now that I know how to get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ms-Crispy-Chocolate-Spread-Flavour/dp/B079Z6GT99/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=crispy+m%26m+spread&amp;qid=1574192358&amp;sr=8-1">M&amp;M's Crispy Chocolate Spread</a> ($15) in the US. Previously <a href="https://www.popsugar.co.uk/food/Mars-Chocolate-Spreads-44546617">limited to UK availability</a>, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/trader-joes-chocolate-lava-gnocchi-46891645">the sweet snack</a> can actually be bought on Amazon and eaten as topping or a dessert all on its own!</p>
      <p>It appears the treat launched sometime at the beginning of 2018, but through the ecommerce company, even foodies in the states have the chance to enjoy the M&amp;M's jar. I'm ready to dip any fruit, carb, or candy in sight into the hazelnut-chocolate spread once it hits my doorstep â€” crispy candy pieces and all. Friends and family, beware! I'm otherwise occupied in eating my heart out until further notice.</p>
