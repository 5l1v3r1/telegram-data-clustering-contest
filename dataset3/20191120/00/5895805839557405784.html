      <p>Many of us are dogged by self-doubt, wondering if we’re on the wrong track, feeling small because we don’t feel up to the big challenges our lives impose.</p>
      <p>Many, but not all of us. Some people have discovered a solution available to all of us.</p>
      <p>The solution starts with an epiphany, a revelation, a sudden awakening to the feeling that the absolute highest truth has been revealed to you. There’s great relief in that moment of awakening –relief you'll never want to lose. You now have your marching orders, your priorities set for life. Maybe you’ve got a guide for life too into the bargain, the leader or guru who introduced you to your revelation. Look to them for what to do. Never again be lost and wondering. From now on your path is clear.</p>
      <p>And so you set out to clear your path forward, sweeping away anything and everything that gets in the way of you marching forward to the tune of the absolute truth you now possess.</p>
      <p>You study in the service of your epiphany. You study the sacred texts and pundits who affirm your epiphany.</p>
      <p>It makes you feel smart to be studying like that, studying all the ways to defeat all opposition to your bright and shining truth. You feel like a wise scholar as you arm yourself with ways to refute all challenges.</p>
      <p>You may have come for the cause, but you stay for the relief, the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/confidence">confidence</a> gained but not just.</p>
      <p>The power too. Because now that you feel like you have the absolute truth down to your very core, you can insist and demand without worrying that you’re overstepping. You can speak with intense, absolutist passion, a steadfastness that no one can budge.</p>
      <p>In debate with you, people give up, benighted losers that they are. Armed with your truths and your reasons for it, you can out-dominate anyone.</p>
      <p>It’s breathtaking, incredible, this combination of insight, self-certainty and power you’ve gained. You no longer feel self-doubt. You no longer feel small. You’re big now. It’s you aligned with the greatest truth.</p>
      <p>Have you become arrogant? Not a chance! You humble yourself before your leader, the greatest truth-teller, and if it was a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/spirituality">spiritual</a> epiphany your leader too is humbled before the great leader, the highest power, whose truths you now possess.</p>
      <p>You’ll never let go. Why would you? Your epiphany solved it all. No way are you ever going to let anyone mess with it. No way are you ever going to have another epiphany as great, some epiphany that makes you doubt your first epiphany. You’re armed not just with refutations for battles with outside challenges, but inside doubt. You can counter any <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxious</a> doubt that might arise in you. With your one great last-word epiphany you saw the light and there’s no turning back. Ever.</p>
      <p>More accurately, you saw the light at the end of self-doubt and you’ve been racing toward it ever since. You are not a wise scholar, but a self-convincing <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception">lying</a> lawyer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/wisdom">Wisdom</a> comes from continuing <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/education">education</a>, no epiphany so great that you assume it’s your last.</p>
      <p>What is wisdom? The serenity prayer suggests that it’s the wisdom to know the differences that make a difference but that’s not quite right. After all, what does “Wisdom to know” even mean? Isn’t that just knowledge?</p>
      <p>No, wisdom is the ongoing, lifelong quest to know better and better the differences that make a difference. Wisdom is the praying or questing itself, recognizing that there’s more learning to be done, more refinements to be made.</p>
      <p>That light of absolute truth that you scramble toward is not wisdom but its opposite: Wise-guy, know-it-all, self-aggrandizement. As you study your sacred texts, spiritual, political, whatever, you’re not coming to understand the reasons why your awakening happens to have been proven to be the best possible. Rather, you’re becoming a master rationalizer. You now put your claim of having gained absolute truth above all else, including your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ethics-and-morality">conscience</a>.</p>
      <p>You have joined a cult. A party-above-all-else party. And why? You may claim that it’s for the great cause, but it isn’t. You’ve joined the party-above-all-else party because it puts you above all else. It clears the way for you to feel big and self-certain, like a god, eternally infallible, invincible and incorruptible, right, righteous and mighty.</p>
      <p>Passionate self-certainty is power and power is a joy and a relief. Power gives one the false sense that one has command over one’s circumstances, freed from self-doubt forevermore.</p>
      <p>Power, however gained is something people crave, value and are unwilling to surrender. It’s therefore easy for people to become fervid crusaders for causes they don’t care about at all. They’re in it to win it, not because they care about what they’re winning other than the unbounded license to demand for more power.<br/><br/>That’s an amazing fact about human life. One can crusade as if in possession of last word on a topic that one has neither thought about nor cares about. Virtual virtue – the sensation of virtue with none of the disorienting ongoing wisdom-quest.</p>
      <p>It starts with one of those last-word epiphanies. They mark our escape from reason to rationalization, self-doubt to self-certainty, feeling small to feeling indominable, curiosity to absolutism. What wouldn’t we give for such escapes? People gladly sacrifice their consciences for the cause ­– the cause of freeing ourselves from the entangling burdens of conscience. I once was lost but now I’m blind.</p>
      <p>So that’s how it’s done. That’s how to free ourselves once and for all from self-doubt and that torturous feeling of smallness. Have a conscience-ectomy. Shed the extra weight and stride forth ever-<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">thankful</a> for your once-and-for-all, last-word epiphany.</p>
