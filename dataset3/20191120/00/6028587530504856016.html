      <p>Have a chronic health condition? Now is the time to examine your care needs and financial picture while comparing health insurance options for next year.Even if you plan to keep the job-based coverage you have for 2020, your benefits structure may have changed or you may have overlooked a useful benefit that could help your health or wealth, so it pays to open the plan documents and sneak a peek. Think of it as step one of your health-related New Year’s resolutions.</p>
      <p>If you have employer-based coverage, chances are you face a coming deadline to enroll or reenroll in a health plan. No job-based plan but under age 65 and not eligible for Medicare? Try the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare marketplace, with subsidies available to offset the premium cost for those who qualify. The sign-up period ends Dec. 15 for a Jan. 1 start date. Go to <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">Healthcare.gov</a> or call a marketplace navigator in your state (number available on the state exchange website) for help with the process. </p>
      <p>“If you’ve got a chronic condition then you have foreseeable medical bills so you want the insurance that gives you the most protection against them,” said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the <a href="https://www.kff.org/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization in Washington that offers consumers a <a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/">calculator</a> to estimate subsidies on the exchanges. “You definitely have to pay attention to deductibles, copays and cost-sharing and how that works for the stuff you need.”</p>
      <p>For the 30 million Americans with diabetes, for example, shopping for insurance can bring up layers of questions, said Christel Marchard Aprigliano, vice president for strategic alliance advocacy at the American Diabetes Association, which estimates that people with diabetes have <a href="https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/cost-diabetes">expenses 2.3 times higher</a> than those without diabetes. </p>
      <p>“This is the exact time when people need to sit down and say ‘What are the drugs that I take? How many times do I see a specialist?’” she said, “and talk to a health professional, if they have to be switched to another medication, about what they can do about it. Sometimes they can get overrides.”</p>
      <p>People with diabetes sometimes face non-medical switching, meaning they are switched to different medications or different levels of prescription coverage due to economic factors out of their control, such as rebates their health insurers receive, Aprigliano said.</p>
      <p>The big message: Don’t go without any coverage at all, Aprigliano said. Be aware of your options, from high deductible health plans to copay cards, seeing specialists to general practitioners and diabetes educators. </p>
      <p>
        <b>High Deductibles and Patient Assistance Plans</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2020, qualifying high-deductible health plans paired with health savings accounts will have a minimum deductible of $1,400 for individuals or $2,800 for family coverage. For those with high incomes or whose employer offers money toward the deductible, HSAs can be a useful financial planning tool. They offer an attractive triple tax benefit: money goes in the account pre-tax, grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free as long as it’s used for qualified health expenses. </p>
      <p>But keep in mind that by law HSAs require you to self-fund all costs except preventive care until you meet the deductible, Pollitz said. Only then will insurance kick in to reimburse you. If your deductible is substantially higher than the minimum level and you have a bad year, or if your savings is low, you can end up with big medical bills. </p>
      <p>Insurance coverage for things like continuous glucose monitors has improved but is still not universal, Aprigliano said.</p>
      <p>“You need to be your biggest advocate and contact your health insurance company and find out what devices are covered, what is considered durable medical equipment, what is considered on formulary, and if they have copay cards for the existing medications you have.”</p>
      <p>All three U.S. insulin manufacturers — <a href="https://www.insulinaffordability.com/discount-programs.html">Eli Lilly</a>, <a href="https://www.novomedlink.com/diabetes-patient-support/prescription-savings.html">Novo Nordisk</a>, and <a href="https://www.teamingupfordiabetes.com/sanofidiabetes-savings-program">Sanofi</a> — offer patient assistance programs. Copay cards are available to those with private insurance, with some offering a month of insulin for less than $100. </p>
      <p>“Diabetes is a self-managed disease that requires a lot of knowledge and a lot of support,” said Aprigliano, who has had type 1 diabetes for 36 years. “I spend probably about 10 hours a year with medical professionals in an exam room. The rest of the time I’m making decisions on my own about how to stay healthy.”</p>
      <p>That can be daunting, especially when you’re first diagnosed. Do you want to do finger sticks to check blood sugar throughout the day or wear a pump? If you’re open to a device, what kind should you consider? What about diet and exercise? </p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of crowdsourcing that’s done and a lot of information that’s shared, and it comes back to what your insurance pays for,” Aprigiliano said, noting that many tubed pumps cost thousands of dollars. “It’s not like you can test drive this car and return it. You do a lot of homework before you get a device.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Look for Hidden Benefits like Education</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another option is to discuss your health insurance tradeoffs and self management issues with a diabetes educator, now called a diabetes care and education specialist. These are health professionals with extra training in diabetes management, which can help prevent hospitalization and lower the risk of complications. </p>
      <p>Coverage for these visits varies, but Medicare covers 10 hours of diabetes self-management education in the first year and two hours every subsequent year, Diana Isaacs, spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.diabeteseducator.org/">American Association of Diabetes Educators</a>, wrote in an email. Private insurers often use Medicare as a benchmark for coverage.</p>
      <p>Visits with a diabetes educator require a doctor’s referral and are recommended at four critical junctures: At the time of a diabetes diagnosis, every year thereafter, when new complicating factors arise and when a patient experiences transitions in care, according to Isaacs. But less than 5% of Medicare beneficiaries and just shy of 7% of privately insured people with diabetes participate in services within the first year of diagnosis. It’s worth asking your doctor and checking your insurance to see if it’s covered.</p>
      <p>Patients also can use the association’s <a href="https://www.diabeteseducator.org/practice/educator-tools/app-resources/affordability-resources">cost saving resources</a> for more information on insulin and non-insulin medications. </p>
      <p>“It's also good to work with your pharmacist to see if generic medications or lower cost options could be used and to constantly reassess the treatment plan to see if any medications can be discontinued,” wrote Isaacs, who is also a pharmacist.</p>
      <p>In some cases, exercise can help bring total costs down.</p>
      <p>”Physical activity can be one of the best and cheapest medicines and can be as simple as walking or chair exercises,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>People with diabetes should seek all the support they need as they go into open enrollment, Aprigliano said. “It can be a very lonely disease. Despite all the efforts, it can be a disease where we’re judged. Nobody can poke our pancreas and go, ‘Well, it didn’t work very well, so that’s the reason.’ </p>
      <p>A common assumption is that people with diabetes somehow brought it on themselves, she said. ““We still face a lot of discrimination and stigma, especially my type 2 friends.”</p>
