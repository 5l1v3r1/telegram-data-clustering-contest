      <h1>Calling health sector startups</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.innovatorsmag.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Staff reporter</a></address>
      <p>A dedicated digital heath and wellness hub at <a href="https://www.4yfn.com/barcelona/">4YFN Barcelona 2020</a> will give startups pioneering solutions in this area the chance to pitch to investors. Building on the success of this year’s Digital Health and Wellness Summit at 4YFN, which will run again in 2020, the startup platform of GSMA’s MWC series is partnering with <a href="https://echalliance.com/">ECHAlliance</a> on delivering the new hub.</p>
      <blockquote>“Healthcare is one of the fastest-growing sectors for startups and we are seeing incredible advances in the field of medicine, increasingly powered in large part by entrepreneurs and small businesses as the consumer health revolution gathers pace. We need a dedicated space to convene, discuss and network for all of the corporations, investors and startups that make up this vibrant ecosystem and 4YFN Barcelona is the perfect place to do so,” said Bleddyn Rees, ECHAlliance Deputy Chair.</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://www.4yfn.com/barcelona/">4YFN Barcelona 2020</a>, an event we are media partners with, takes place from 24 to 26 February. <a href="https://www.4yfn.com/barcelona/">Be part of it</a>.</p>
