      <p>DOTHAN, Ala. (AP) - A judge in Tennessee has dropped a human trafficking charge against former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a> player <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-farmer/">Jim Farmer</a>.</p>
      <p>The Dothan Eagle quotes defense lawyer Worrick G. Robinson IV as saying a court dismissed the charge against the one-time University of Alabama standout on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Robinson says the decision came during a preliminary hearing for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-farmer/">Farmer</a>.</p>
      <p>The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation says the 55-year-old resident of Franklin, Tennessee, was among 16 men arrested last month on charges of seeking sex from minors. The men were arrested during a two-day sting operation.</p>
