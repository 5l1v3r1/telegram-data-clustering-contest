      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Thinks Top-5 Team Is Just “A Placeholder”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:57:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday night, the third <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">College Football Playoff Rankings</a> of the 2019 season were released. After yet another wild weekend of college football, there wasn’t much change at the top of the rankings, but the middle of the rankings saw significant turnover.</p>
      <p>LSU, Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia held down the top spots after all winning last weekend.</p>
      <p>The most-interesting storyline to follow over the final few weeks of the season centers around Alabama. The Crimson Tide lost star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, but still sit at No. 5 in the rankings.</p>
      <p>After the rankings were released, ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit suggested the Crimson Tide are just a “placeholder” right now, per <a href="https://247sports.com/LongFormArticle/college-football-playoff-rankings-Kirk-Herbstreit-Alabama-LSU-Clemson-Ohio-State-Michigan-Georgia-Oklahoma-Oregon-138880977/#138880977_1">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Alabama is a little bit of a wild-card right now with a big part of their offense obviously Tua. Tua now out. We’ll see how Mac Jones does. I view Alabama is somewhat of a holding pattern until we see them with Mac Jones. It’s very difficult to penalize them. I’ll call Alabama as a placeholder right now.”</blockquote>
      <p>Alabama is in an awkward spot. Either Oregon or Utah could jump the Tide with a conference title.</p>
      <p>Nick Saban and company have proved their worth over the years, but it seems they could be on the outside looking in this time around.</p>
