      <h1>A New Type of Migraine Medication Just Passed a Promising Large-Scale Trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">CARLY CASSELLA</a></address>
      <p>A new class of migraine medication could make a "<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-11-19/new-type-of-drug-might-ease-migraines">big difference</a>" for those in desperate need of relief.</p>
      <p>The drug ubrogepant has not yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, but a large-scale clinical trial suggests this oral pill might work safely where other treatments do not.</p>
      <p>Within two hours of being taken, researchers found ubrogepant could stop a severe migraine in its tracks, performing significantly better than a placebo and with fewer risks than other drugs.</p>
      <p>"Having ubrogepant as a potential new medication for the acute treatment of migraine will provide much-needed innovation for a disease that causes lost time for millions of people," <a href="https://www.allergan.com/News/Details/2019/11/Allergan%20Announces%20Positive%20Phase%203%20ACHIEVE%20II%20Trial%20Results%20for%20Ubrogepant%20Published%20in%20The%20Journal">says</a> neurologist Richard Lipton, a consultant for Allergan, the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the trial.</p>
      <p>A debilitating migraine is more than just a bad headache, and it's much harder for physicians to treat. In the US, more than 38 million people suffer from this neurological disease, and surveys show <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/otolaryngology/_docs/Migraine%20patient%20handout.pdf">less than a third</a> are satisfied with their care.</p>
      <p>When it comes to effective and safe treatment, <a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2019/02/migraine-future.php">each patient is a little different</a>, and in some of the more severe cases, options are limited and can even make things worse.</p>
      <p>Since the 1990s, triptans have remained the most popular class of migraine medication for cases where over-the-counter meds simply don't work.</p>
      <p>But while triptans might help reduce pain and inflammation, they also constrict the body's blood vessels. As a result, these drugs are not safe for people with <a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/oral-triptan-therapy/">high risks of heart disease or stroke</a>, and still others don't respond to them at all.</p>
      <p>Even so, there haven't been any new treatments for acute migraines in a long time. In fact, the FDA only recently approved a novel class of medication, called gepants, which can help stop severe headaches before they even get started.</p>
      <p>Unlike triptans, which target serotonin in the brain, gepants target a molecule called <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cgrp-new-era-migraine-treatment-2018030513315">calcitonin gene-related peptide</a> (CGRP) that has a <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-effective-migraine-drug-available-soon-erunumab-cgrp">known role</a> in migraines.</p>
      <p>So far, only three CGRP inhibitors have <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-11-19/new-type-of-drug-might-ease-migraines">been approved</a> by the FDA and all of these are injections. If ubrogepant is deemed safe and effective enough, it will be one of the first oral gepants that can prevent acute migraines.</p>
      <p>In a Phase 3 clinical trial, which was randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, researchers tested out two different doses of ubrogepant on 1,686 patients, all of whom reported migraines between 2 and 8 times a month.</p>
      <p>Participants were either given a tablet of ubrogepant containing 50 mg, 25 mg, or a placebo. During the trial, they were instructed to take one tablet as soon as possible, or within 4 hours of a moderate or severe migraine coming on.</p>
      <p>If that initial dose wasn't enough to stop the pain, a second dose was allowed, and this was randomised so that the patient either received a placebo or a repeat dose of ubrogepant. 'Rescue medication', like acetaminophen, NSAIDs, opioids, antiemetics, or triptans, was only used in cases where both doses did not work.</p>
      <p>Of all those who took the lower and higher dose of ubrogepant, over 20 percent were free of pain within two hours. In comparison, the placebo relieved only 14 percent.</p>
      <p>Getting rid of the most bothersome symptoms was a bit harder and required a higher dose of ubrogepant. In this case, only those taking 50 mg were significantly better off than those taking the placebo.</p>
      <p>"The current results indicate that 50 mg of ubrogepant has the potential to address key treatment goals in the acute treatment of migraine," Lipton and his colleagues <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2755615?guestAccessKey=ebc7732d-e666-466d-ada8-55e70734166b&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=111919">write</a>.</p>
      <p>"Ubrogepant's mechanism of action may make it an option for people who do not respond to currently available medications."</p>
      <p>It's an effective drug, but it's not as impressive as other medication already on the market. Previous research, for instance, has shown that within an hour, triptans can <a href="https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/pain/headache/migraine/choosing-right-triptan">show safe and effective response rates</a> in up to 70 percent of patients.</p>
      <p>Neurologist Stephen Silberstein who was not involved in the study <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/health/ubrogepant-migraine-drug-trial/index.html">told</a> CNN that while ubrogepants might be useful for those who can't tolerate triptans, they aren't better and they aren't a magic cure-all.</p>
      <p>Instead, it's better to consider ubrogepant as a promising new mode of treatment for those patients who have slipped through the cracks.</p>
      <p>"For the first time in a long time we've gone from no news to lots of good news," Silberstein <a href="https://www.neurologylive.com/clinical-focus/the-impact-of-gepants-cgrp-inhibition-on-the-migraine-treatment-landscape">wrote</a> in a recent review of the research.</p>
      <p>"We've gone to these new medicines for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have new medicines for the prevention of migraine."</p>
      <p>Further research will be needed to evaluate the long-term safety of these drugs, but <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-11-19/new-type-of-drug-might-ease-migraines">according to Lipton</a>, FDA approval could come as early as next month.</p>
      <p>This study was published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2755615?guestAccessKey=ebc7732d-e666-466d-ada8-55e70734166b&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=111919"><i>JAMA</i></a>.</p>
