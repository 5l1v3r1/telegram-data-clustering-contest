      <h4>The budget airline's policy is now null and void in Spain following a passenger's complaint. However, Ryanair has indicated it may not follow the ruling.</h4>
      <p>A Spanish court on Wednesday ruled <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/ryanair-ceo-micheal-oleary-says-job-cuts-are-coming/a-49834347">Ryanair</a> could no longer charge an extra fee for hand luggage in the Iberian country.</p>
      <p>The court termed it "abusive" after a passenger complained following a trip from Madrid to Brussels. She then took the airline to court over the incident after airline staff forced her to pay €20 ($22) to bring her 10 kilogram (22 pound) luggage on board.</p>
      <p>The court ordered the Dublin-based airline to refund her the €20 plus interest, but turned down the passenger's request for an additional €10 in compensation.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Immediate change</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ruling, which cannot be appealed, means the budget airline's cabin baggage policy is now null and void and states the airline must "remove it" from its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>Until now, Ryanair only allows small bags into the cabin if they can be placed under the seat in front, but larger bags of up to 10 kilograms incur a fee, or a priority boarding pass which customers must also pay for.</p>
      <p>In November 2018, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/ryanair-challenged-over-misleading-cabin-baggage-information/a-46401229">the Federation of German Consumer Organizations (vzbv) accused Ryanair</a> of providing misleading information and insufficient pricing information about its cabin bag policy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Possible flouting of the new ruling</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Irish company hinted that it may ignore the Spanish court's decision when it released a statement in response saying: "This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, as it misquoted the (European Court of Justice) and misinterpreted the airlines’ commercial freedom to determine the size of their cabin baggage."</p>
      <p>When asked if it was planning to carry on regardless or appeal the ruling in the European Court of Justice, the airline declined to comment.</p>
