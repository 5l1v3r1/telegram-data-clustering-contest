      <p>The prosecution in the case in which embattled Chief Executive Officer of Menzgold Ghana Limited Nana Appiah Mensah (NAM1) is standing trial has demanded a long adjournment following “recent discoveries.”</p>
      <p>The state was expected to substitute the old charges with a new one where 48 new charges are expected to be added to the 13 that were earlier slapped on him.</p>
      <p>In Court on Wednesday, ASP Sylvester Asare informed the Accra Circuit Court presided over by Her Honour Mrs Harriete Akweley Quaye that they want a long adjournment “preferably January.”</p>
      <p>He said investigations are in progress and “We are at an advanced stage and we humbly invite the court to give us a long date preferable first week in January.</p>
      <p>He said prosecution wanted to substitute the charge sheet with an amended version but upon recent discoveries, they wanted long date.</p>
      <p>The court wondered why the prosecution did do the necessary things before filing the charge sheet.</p>
      <p>The court said adjourning the case to January next year is not appropriate and asked the parties to take a date in December.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor and defence team led by Andrew Twum who held brief for Lawyer Kwame Akuffo settled on December 23, 2019.</p>
      <p>Nana Appiah Mensah, affectionately called NAM1 and three others have been charged with fraud.</p>
