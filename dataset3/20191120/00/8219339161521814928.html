      <h1>Porsche CEO talks iPhone vs Android popularity among owners in the United States and China</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:16:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Speaking today at the <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/16/2019-la-auto-show-promises-big-ford-and-tesla-ev-reveals-startup-news/">Automobility conference in Los Angeles</a>, Porsche’s North American president and CEO, Klaus Zellmer, touched on the popularity of iPhone and Android among Porsche owners. Zellmer also explained how those statistics affect development of Porsche features.</p>
      <p>The executive explained that among Porsche owners in the United States, 91% use an Apple device. That’s a very high percentage, especially when you consider <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/09/iphone-north-america-marketshare/">Apple’s overall marketshare</a> in the United States compared to Android.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, if you look at China, Zellmer said that 80% of Porsche customers use an Apple device. Again, that’s abnormally high when you factor in some of the challenges <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/18/apples-china-problems/">Apple has faced in the Chinese market</a>. But, Zellmer said that if you ask those owners in China what their next device will be, 40% say they plan to switch to Android.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Zellmer said on stage at Automobility:</p>
      <blockquote>“We will offer Android solutions. Why aren’t we doing that right now? Let’s take a look at the United States. 91% of Porsche customers have an Apple device. So, this is how you most efficiently invest your money. But if you take China for example, of our current customers in China, 80% of them have an Apple device, which is also staggering.<br/><br/>If you ask them what their next device is going to be, actually 40% of those say it’s going to be an Android device. So there’s a lot of movement in the market and obviously you have to do what customers do.”</blockquote>
      <p>Zellmer’s explanation came in response to a question about how Porsche plans to better integrate Android solutions. For example, the <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/porsche-taycan/">Porsche Taycan</a> features Apple CarPlay integration, as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/19/apple-music-porsche-taycan/">well as in-car Apple Music streaming</a>. Zellmer seems to think that over time, Porsche will expand with more Android-centric solutions, but for now, it makes much more sense to focus on the iPhone from a business perspective.</p>
