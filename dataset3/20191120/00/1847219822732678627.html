        <b>«Evaluation and reorganization of small and very small state institutions so far has not given us desired results. This is because there has not been a reduction of the number of state institution employees or funding,» said chairman of Saeima’s Public Expenditures and Audit Committee Kaspars Ģirģens.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, 20 November, representatives of the State Chancellery informed members of the committee about the situation with reorganization of small and very small state administration institutions, which is part of the State Administration Reform Plan 2020. As part of the plan, functions and organization of said institutions are to be reviewed and their support functions are to be gradually centralized.</p>
      <h3>Meanwhile, Ģirģens said after the committee’s meeting that centralization of such support functions like accounting and procurement does not always ensure reduction of the size of the state apparatus.</h3>
      <p>On top of that, reorganization is made all the more complicated by the fact that the processes part of it are supervised by ministries, not the State Chancellery, which had developed the reform plan, says Ģirģens.</p>
      <p>In State Audits evaluation of 17 small and very small state administration institutions performed in 2017 it was concluded that there are no major legal obstacles before the reorganization of institutions mentioned in the report. At the time, the State Chancellery told members of the Public Expenditures Committee that the institution will decide on reforming smaller institutions.</p>

      <p>«What we’ve heard so far basically means in two years’ time only one institutions has been liquidated. Discussions still continue about several others. This could mean there is resistance from ministries and a shortage of cross-sectoral coordination,» stresses Ģirģens.</p>
      <p>Deputies asked the State Chancellery to keep the committee informed about the reform’s progress.</p>
