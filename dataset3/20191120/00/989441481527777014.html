      <p>Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) difference with the ruling coalition EPRDF, soon to be rebranded as “Prosperity Party,” seems to be widening.</p>
      <p>As news that TPLF central committee is meeting in Mekelle following its disagreement with the merger of member parties of the coalition to form a single national party in social media, TPLF wrote a letter to EPRDF saying that it will not take part in the upcoming EPRDF council meeting which is anticipated to approve decision from executive committee meeting.</p>
      <p>The letter which is signed by the Organization’s political head, Alem Gebrewahed, is shared on the official facebook page of TPLF. Merger of the ruling coalition is not something that could be decided at the level of the executive committee of EPRDF council level, says the letter among other things. . For that reason, said TPLF, its members will not take part in the council meeting which will take place on Thursday, November 21, 2019.</p>

      <p>Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Council (EPRDF) council has 180 members equally drawn from the four-member parties that constitute the coalition namely, Amharic Democratic Party (ADP), Oromo Democratic Party (ODP), South Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (SEPDM) and Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).</p>
      <p>If TPLF is not sending central council members to the council meeting, it means that the ruling coalition could only carry out with 135 council members assuming that all the non-TPLF council members could make it to the meeting.</p>
      <p>The council is one of the platforms where major political battles take place and it seems the case that TPLF possibly anticipated political defeat in that platform. </p>
      <p>Last week, TPLF started to attend the executive committee meeting of the coalition which was called to discuss the merger of members of the ruling coalition, including the non-voting members, but discontinued it on the second day of the meeting (Sunday) after the party’s executive committee approved the merger agenda with majority votes. The agenda was approved after the committee agreed on the result of the research conducted for years to determine the merger agenda.  Six members of TPLF voted against the merger during the executive meeting.</p>
      <p>What will be the fate of TPLF if the EPRDF council approves the merger? It is unclear at this point. But TPLF’s letter said that “TPLF’s fate can be determined in the organization’s congress after discussions at different levels of the party structure carried out.”</p>
      <p>This week, the party’s newspaper said, as reported by VOA Amharic that TPLF could create a <a href="https://borkena.com/2019/11/19/ethiopia-tplf-abiy-ahmed-meeting-ended-in-vain/">“de facto state”</a> since it has the capacity to form “all the necessary institutions of the state”</p>
      <p>TPLF leaders have been talking for several months now that there is a <a href="https://borkena.com/2019/06/12/people-of-tigray-have-developed-sentiment-for-secession-debretsion/">secessionist sentiment in Tigray</a> at this time but opposition voices in the region and public opinion do not seem to suggest that way.</p>
