      <h1>Huge feedback on controversial plan to light up Hagley Oval</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/louis.day%40starmedia.kiwi" target="_blank">Louis Day</a></address>
      <p>About 2200 groups and individuals have made submissions on the controversial plan to install six 48.9m permanent lights at Christchurch's Hagley Oval.</p>
      <p>“Staff will now analyse all of the submissions and prepare a report for the elected members’ hearings panel that will be convened in early December to consider the feedback and make recommendations to the council,’’ said Christchurch City Council head of parks Andrew Rutledge.</p>
      <p>The number of submissions received tops the 1063 submissions made on the proposed $10 million grant for Christ Church Cathedral. The deadline for submissions was 5pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>The high number comes after New Zealand Cricket sent an e-newsletter to cricket fans nationwide, outlining its support of the Canterbury Cricket Trust’s bid to get the six permanent lights installed.</p>
      <p>“Given there are currently no South Island international cricket venues with lights, New Zealand Cricket strongly supports the CCT’s proposal and invites readers to make submissions to the two authorities involved,” the e-newsletter read.</p>
      <p>The trust wants to use earthquake recovery laws to fast track the installation of the lights in a bid to secure high-profile games for the 2021 Women’s Cricket World Cup.</p>
      <p>It has also applied to the city council for a new lease to accommodate the lights.</p>
      <p>Crown-council planning agency Regenerate Christchurch applied to the city council for a new lease to accommodate the lights and to associate Greater Christchurch Regeneration Minister Poto Williams to fast track changes to the District Plan under section 71 of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act to allow for the lights to be installed.</p>
      <p>Public consultation for the proposal to Ms Williams closes on December 2.</p>
