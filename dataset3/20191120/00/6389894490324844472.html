      <h1>Meet the UK’s 70 fastest-growing tech firms</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:01:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Menin</a></address>
      <p>70 of the most promising high-growth tech firms in the UK have been named as the country’s top scaleup companies by tech group Silicon Valley Comes to the UK (SVC2UK).</p>
      <p>Media intelligence company Signal AI, car insurance specialist Cuvva, and online plant store Patch are among the firms that have been selected for SC2UK’s 2019 Scale Up Club.</p>
      <p>The chosen scaleups - fast-growing companies that have expanded beyond the startup stage - are invited to a special summit in London later this month, and are offered mentoring and support from SVC2UK from businesspeople on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>“The UK’s most ambitious tech scaleups have been going from strength to strength, and we’re proud to celebrate what this year’s founders have achieved,” said SVC2UK director Janet Coyle.</p>
      <p>This year’s club members boast a total of 3,246 employees and a combined revenue of £180m in 2018.</p>
      <p>Previous Scale Up Club Alumni include currency transfer specialist Transferwise, travel website Skyscanner and virtual keyboard app Swiftkey.</p>
      <p>“London continues to work with Silicon Valley and other tech hubs around the world to promote greater inclusivity and we are proud to see that 39% of this year’s scale ups are led by women entrepreneurs,” said Coyle.</p>
      <p>“The Scale Up Club provides a great opportunity to bring together some of the best entrepreneurs, chief executives and mentors from the UK and Bay Area and we can’t wait to demonstrate the power of collaboration."</p>
