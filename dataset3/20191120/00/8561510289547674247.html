      <h1>Research: DMT’s Effects on Brainwaves Could Explain Consciousness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <p>In April, Imperial College London <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/worlds-first-center-psychedelics-research">launched the Centre for Psychedelic Research</a>, a first-of-its-kind facility focused on the study of mind-altering substances.</p>
      <p>While much of that research has centered on psilocybin and LSD, one team out of the Centre recently published a study focused <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/natural-psychedelic-mammal-brains">dimethyltryptamine (DMT)</a>, the ingredient that makes the psychoactive brew <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27203322">ayahuasca</a> cause hallucinations — and they say the insights gleaned from that research could help us finally understand consciousness.</p>
      <p>For their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51974-4?fbclid=IwAR1QOx0Dwzm8XXLYhJAj6vI4_SD_zfULw6SDUfFAQY0OuzNj-ma13ZAokDc">study</a>, which was published on Tuesday in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>, the researchers asked 13 volunteers to strap on brain activity-monitoring EEG caps and electrodes while the scientists pumped DMT into their veins.</p>
      <p>Based on the researchers’ analysis of the data, DMT might share psilocybin and LSD’s psychoactive traits, but it does something very different to a user’s brain — while those drugs mainly reduce brainwave activity, DMT produces a brief increase in theta waves, which are associated with the dreams you have while you’re asleep.</p>
      <p>DMT also made users’ brain activity generally more chaotic and harder to predict, except at the “peak” of their trip, at which point a pattern began to form in the brainwaves.</p>
      <p>“From the altered brainwaves and participants’ reports, it’s clear these people are completely immersed in their experience,” research Christopher Timmermann said in a <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/193993/ayahuasca-compound-changes-brainwaves-vivid-waking-dream/">press release</a>. “It’s like daydreaming only far more vivid and immersive; it’s like dreaming but with your eyes open.”</p>
      <p>Robin Carhart-Harris, head of the Centre, said in the press release that it’s still too soon to know whether DMT might have therapeutic uses — but the knowledge that the drug appears to produce something akin to waking sleep could help unravel the mystery of <a href="https://futurism.com/brain-activity-creates-consciousness">consciousness</a>.</p>
      <p>“Our sense [is] that research with DMT may yield important insights into the relationship between brain activity and consciousness,” he said, “and this small study is a first step along that road.”</p>
