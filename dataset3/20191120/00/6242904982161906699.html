        <b>Deportivo Alaves midfielder Mubarak Wakaso has started training after recovering from an injury, GHANAsoccernet.com can confirm.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old completed the entire session at the José Luis Compañón Sports City with a protective cover.</p>
      <p>Wakaso missed Ghana's 2021 Africa Cup of Nation qualifiers against South Africa and Sao Tome and Principe due to the setback.</p>
      <p>He suffered a fracture in the metacarpus of his right hand, which saw him miss Alaves 4-2 defeat to Osasuna in the La Liga two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The Ghana international underwent a successful surgery to correct the defect.</p>
      <p>He has now returned to full scale training after recovering fully from the injury.</p>
      <p>The swashbuckling midfielder has been a mainstay in manager Asier Geratino's side this season, missing just a single game through suspension.</p>
      <p>He could now be available for selection against Eibar on Sunday.</p>
