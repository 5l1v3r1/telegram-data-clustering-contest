      <h1>Asia shares numbed by trade noise, oil takes a spill</h1>
      <h2>Japan's Nikkei eased 0.2% and South Korea 0.4%. E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.1%.</h2>

      <p>Asian shares lumbered lower on Wednesday as the Sino-U.S. trade talks produced nothing but a stream of conflicting messages, while concerns about a glut of supply saw oil prices suffer their biggest spill in seven weeks.</p>
      <p>Figures from the American Petroleum Institute out late Tuesday showed a far larger rise in crude stocks than expected. That followed reports Russia was unlikely to deepen its cuts to crude output.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures stood at $60.91 a barrel early on Wednesday, after sliding 2.6% overnight, while U.S. crude recouped a single cent to $55.22.</p>
      <p>Action in share markets was subdued with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off 0.25%. Japan's Nikkei eased 0.2% and South Korea 0.4%. E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Hopes for progress on the U.S.-China dispute had risen on Tuesday when Bloomberg reported that the previous talks that failed in May were being considered as a benchmark on what U.S. tariffs on China would be rolled back.</p>
      <p>But later, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs further if China would not agree to a deal that he liked.</p>
      <p>The aggressive tone unsettled Wall Street and the Dow ended Tuesday down 0.36%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.06% and the Nasdaq added 0.24%.</p>
      <p>Dour forecasts from retailers Home Depot and Kohl's fuelled worries about consumer spending, while the energy sector was the S&amp;P's biggest loser as oil slid.</p>

        <b>FED IN FOCUS</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The immediate focus remains on the U.S.-China trade talks, and markets seem reluctant to move much in either direction until they are resolved," wrote analysts at ANZ in a note.</p>
      <p>"It was noticeable that fixed income markets rallied despite equity markets being stable, suggestive of a market that remains cautious about the growth outlook."</p>
      <p>Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries dropped to a two-week trough at 1.77%, with a marked flattening of the curve hinting at a possible return of recession fears.</p>
      <p>The dip in yields nudged the dollar down on the safe-haven Japanese yen and it was last at 108.43, though still within the 107.87 to 109.48 range of the last five weeks.</p>
      <p>The euro inched up to $1.1077, but faced chart resistance at $1.1090. The dollar was steadier on a basket of currencies at 97.829 .</p>
      <p>Investors are now awaiting minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting where it cut interest rates and signalled a pause for the time being.</p>
      <p>"The minutes will elaborate on the Fed's view that the downside risks to the U.S. economy have eased, and that a "material reassessment" of the economic outlook will be needed for it to cut rates again," said Joseph Capurso, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>
      <p>"We see the FOMC now on hold until March, 2020."</p>
      <p>The market has all but given up on the prospect of an easing in December, which is now priced at just 0.8%. A move in March is put at a probability of around 42%.</p>
      <p>The risk-off tone helped spot gold firm 0.1% to $1,474.14 per ounce.</p>
