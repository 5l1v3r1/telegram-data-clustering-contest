        <b>Basilisk, one of the most improved horses at Kranji, looks ready to greet the judge again on Friday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Leslie Khoo-trained five-year-old showed his winning intentions with a brilliant hit-out yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>Giving a stablemate some headstart, the bay New Zealand-bred gelding picked up nicely to overtake his stablemate and clock 37.1sec for 600m on the Polytrack.</p>
      <p>Basilisk finished so full of running that his rider allowed his mount to carry on cruising until deep into the backstraight.</p>
      <p>Basilisk pulled up very well. He looked a ball of muscle as he trotted back into the tunnel leading to the stable blocks.</p>
      <p>Basilisk, struggled a while before coming right again at the start of his Kranji career.</p>
      <p>He scored first success at his eighth start, in a Restricted Maiden affair, after securing three seconds and a third.</p>
      <p>He struggled after that, although he popped in for a few more placings. Then the turnaround came and it was onward and upward for the Tan Le En-owned galloper.</p>
      <p>It was on that Aug 16 meeting that made the day for both horse and rider. Basilisk won and gave apprentice jockey Joseph See his first winner after resuming from a long layoff as a result of a disqualification.</p>
      <p>See rode a well-judged race, bringing Basilisk storming home to take a Class 5 event over 1,400m by two easy lengths from Born To Win.</p>
      <p>Promoted to Class 4 in his next race on Sept 15, the Basilisk-See combination nearly scored a back-to-back double.</p>
      <p>See brought Basilisk home with his customary brilliant finish, but Sacred Don was safely home by less than 1/2 length. It was over the Polytrack 1,200m.</p>
      <p>Back to the 1,400m on turf with jockey Benny Woodworth astride on Oct 6, Basilisk made amends. He beat Silver Sky by half a length in 1min 22.25sec.</p>
      <p>Then at his last start on Oct 25, also with Woodworth aboard, he came charging home from way back to beat all but Siam Blue Vanda by 13/4 lengths. The winner clocked 1:22.49sec for the 1,400m on turf.</p>
      <p>Judging by his spirited gallop yesterday morning, Basilisk looks set to return to the winner's circle in Friday night's Class 4(1) event over 1,400m.</p>
      <p>Gentlemen Agreement was the other star worker yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Shane Baertschiger-trained five-year-old looked flashy when he galloped over 600m in 36.7sec with From The Navy for company.</p>
      <p>Jockey Ben Thompson was astride Gentlemen Agreement, while Matthew Kellady was aboard the stablemate.</p>
      <p>Last week, I highlighted Gentlemen Agreement as a horse to watch for his next race should he not get a start as the emergency acceptor.</p>
      <p>The horse had won his trial and had worked exceptionnaly well. But there was no scratching, so he failed to secure a run in that assignment over 1,200m.</p>
      <p>He is handicapped in Friday's Class 4(2) event and the 1,400m is more his cup of tea.</p>
