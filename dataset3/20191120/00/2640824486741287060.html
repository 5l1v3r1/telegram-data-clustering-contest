      <p><b>design studio <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/nervous-system/">nervous system</a> has created a series of new spiral puzzles in the shape of ancient fossils.</b> working from the inside-out, the puzzles are pieced together in a swooping spiral to eventually form either an ammonite or a nautilus.</p>

      <p><b><i>‘ammonites are extinct cephalopods related to octopi and squid which roamed the seas from 200 million years ago to 66 million years ago,’</i> explains <a href="https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/">nervous system</a>.</b> <i>‘their fossils feature beautiful and intricate suture patterns where the walls of their shell meet the outside. the branchy shapes of the pieces are based on these patterns.’</i></p>

      <p>meanwhile, nautiluses are cephalopods similarly related to octopi and squid that like the ammonite become larger and larger to accommodate the growing creature it houses inside.</p>

      <p><b>in addition to the branch-like pieces that make up the puzzles, each one contains special pieces in the shape of seahorses and octopi.</b> each one is made-to-order in new york from laser-cut birch plywood and feature a photograph of each fossil, which is viewable once completed.</p>
      <p>
        <b><i>‘our plywood puzzles combine the artistry of classic jigsaws with the possibilities of new technology,’</i> the studio explains.</b>
        <i> ‘we use custom software inspired by natural patterns to grow the intertwining shapes of the puzzle pieces. the organic forms are cut from plywood by a laser, resulting in a uniquely challenging puzzle crafted from premium materials.’</i>
