      <h1>&amp;#039;I wasn’t allowed to buy a red Audi’- Reggae Boy Austin recalls experience of fierce Leeds, Man U rivalry</h1>

      <p>Jamaica international Rodolph Austin recently admitted he was forced to learn the hard way when it comes to the seriousness of local rivalries in English football.</p>
      <p>The hard-nosed central midfielder spent three seasons at the West Yorkshire club Leeds United where he became somewhat of a folk hero for his no-holds-barred brand of play.  The Jamaican, who signed for the club in 2012, was given an education on the nature of English football’s rivalries soon after at a most unlikely place, the car dealership.</p>
      <p>"I needed a car and I remember going to a dealership.  I saw a red Audi and I remember saying: 'Wow, this is nice, I'm going to get it!’</p>
      <p>Austin told Esbjerg fB, his current club in Denmark.</p>
      <blockquote>"I went up to the guy and asked him the price for the red Audi outside and he said: 'You can't get it.' So I said: 'I have the money, why can't I get it?”</blockquote>
      <p>"He said: 'When you play for Leeds, you can't drive anything red, you can't have anything to do with anything red.' I was like: 'Why?'</p>
      <p>"He said: 'You cannot have anything to do with red because of the rivalry between Manchester United and Leeds is so big so no-one can wear red or have anything to do with red.'</p>
      <p>"I didn't even know the guy was a Leeds fan and it just shows you the rivalry so strongly and I had to end up buying a white car."</p>
      <p>Austin made more than 100 appearances for the Elland Road club, even winning the club’s goal of the season award in the 2014-2015 season.  He left England for Denmark after failing to secure a work permit in 2015.  The 34-year-old has made 84 appearances for the Jamaica national team.  The player has served as captain for both Leeds and his national team.</p>
