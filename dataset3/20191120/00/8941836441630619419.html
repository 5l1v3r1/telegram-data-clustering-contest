      <h1>Paul Brown, Halas, Lambeau among all-time coaching finalists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>Such architects of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> as Paul Brown, George Halas and Curly Lambeau are among the 20 coaching finalists for the league’s All-Time Team.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> announced the finalists Wedneday, and 10 of them will make the team. A 26-member voting panel is making the choices.</p>
      <p>Brown recently was selected as professional football’s greatest game changer. Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967, the former Cleveland and Cincinnati coach - he also owned the Bengals - is credited with bringing many now-common elements to the sport like game plans and playbooks; the use of game film in scouting; coaches or coordinators calling plays; a radio transmitter inside the quarterback’s helmet for play-calling; and the helmet facemask.</p>
      <p>Halas was a founding member of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> and long-time coach and owner of the Chicago Bears. Lambeau, whose name is on the iconic stadium in Green Bay where the Packers play, was a championship coach for the franchise.</p>
      <p>The finalists, in alphabetical order:</p>
