      <p>Government will not rule the possibility of building a national shrine for traditional worshippers, the Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi has said.</p>
      <p>According to him, some traditional groups have been canvassing for a national shrine and government will explore the possibility of constructing one.</p>
      <p>“Since I took office, as I said, we have a national mosque and now we are in the process of building a national cathedral. And few times, some traditional groupings have also approached me. There was a group of Wulom?i [Ga Traditional Priests] who also approached me and actually asked for a traditional shrine,” he disclosed at the Meet the Press series Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He continued: “I think that since the constitution allows freedom of worship, we will study it very well and see how possible that will also be. We are not ruling out traditional shrines”.</p>
      <p>The minister also revealed plans to set up a charity commission to evaluate and audit the humanitarian activities of churches.</p>
      <p>He noted the Commission will audit the activities of churches at the end of every year and ensure that they use their financial resources for their intended humanitarian purposes.</p>
      <p>“What we intend doing is to set up what we call a charity commission whereby all churches will be registered so that at the end of the year, the commission will see to the work of the churches and see how they have used their resources for the betterment of their people. So a charity commission is the option and not taxes,” he said.</p>
