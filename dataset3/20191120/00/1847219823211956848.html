        <b>Estonia’s top diplomate Urmas Reinsalu (<i>Pro Patria</i>) has announced prior to a meeting with counterparts from other NATO nations that he considers the alliance strong and sees no alternatives to it.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://news.err.ee/1004995/foreign-minister-nato-is-strong-and-there-is-no-alternative">Estonian public broadcaster ERR reports</a> that on Wednesday, November 20, Reinsalu is among the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels to discuss burden sharing, defence and deterrence, Russia and China.</p>
      <h3>«NATO is strong and there is no alternative to it. The Alliance plays an irreplaceable role in Estonia’s and Europe’s security.</h3>
      <p>Maintaining a strong transatlantic bond is the duty of each and every ally, and in the last five years European allies and Canada have notably increased their spending on defence,» Estonia’s Foreign Minister stated ahead of the meeting.</p>
      <p>The ministers also planned to finalise preparations for the meeting of NATO leaders in London on December 3 and 4.</p>
