      <p>Former House Speaker <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/boehner-paul-ryan-federal-debt-deficit-disappointment-2018-4">John Boehner</a> was immortalised in the House with a congressional portrait unveiling ceremony in a uniting moment for Democrats and Republicans amid a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nancy-pelosi-invites-trump-to-testify-in-impeachment-inquiry-2019-11">divisive impeachment inquiry</a> into President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>The ceremony took place at the House of Representatives on Tuesday. Boehner, a Republican, served as House Speaker for three terms in the last decade before resigning in 2015.</p>
      <p>The former House Speaker received praise from both Democrats and Republicans alike, a rare occurrence since House Democrats opened the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-impeachment-measure-denies-trump-basic-rights-2019-10">all been at odds</a> throughout the impeachment probe, but came together to honour Boehner at the portrait unveiling ceremony.</p>
      <p>Pelosi, who was unseated from a term in 2011 by Boehner, described him as a “great patriot” and “the personification of the American dream.”</p>
      <p>Boehner was known for getting emotional throughout his years he served in the House, and Pelosi recalled a moment in 2006 when Democrats regained House control.</p>
      <p>“I think he was crying when he gave me the gavel as Speaker of the House,” Pelosi said.</p>
      <p>McConnell also joked about Boehner’s tendency to cry, saying he “always worn his heart right on his sleeve.”</p>
      <p>“John was the best dealmaker and negotiator but the worst poker face in American political history,” McConnell said.</p>
      <p>All jokes aside, Schumer spoke to Boehner’s character during his time as House Speaker.</p>
      <p>“Speaker Boehner was always a good man, a decent man,” Schumer said. “He worked to guide the House under the most difficult circumstances. We are glad to see he is enjoying the next chapter of his life.”</p>
      <p>Boehner was not shy to convey his own emotions at the ceremony, and was often seen reaching for tissues throughout.</p>
