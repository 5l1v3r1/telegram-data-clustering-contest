      <p>On August 28, 1922 America’s first radio advertisement was broadcast on New York City’s WEAF. It lasted ten minutes and promoted the Hawthorne Court Apartments in Jackson Heights.The marketers’ gripe about radio advertising in 1922 has followed the medium for almost a century. Audience measurement is deeply flawed.</p>
      <p>In today’s world of audio distributed globally on diverse platforms, the gripe is much the same. </p>
      <p>I recently asked Targetspot client strategist Michael Orfaly to shed light on new offline attribution capabilities that could prove helpful for media planners struggling to accurately measure digital audio.</p>
      <p><b>Paul Talbot:</b> What’s the significance of these new offline attribution capabilities for digital audio?</p>
      <p><b>Michael Orfaly:</b> Broadly, these new offline attribution capabilities put digital audio on the same level with other digital media. The trajectory of digital audio remains significant, and while there is steadily growing agency and advertiser interest, the medium remains undervalued.</p>
      <p>This is one opportunity for advertisers to better understand audio’s value, and thus, increase investment. For us at Targetspot, these new offline attribution capabilities allow us to learn more about our audience and to optimize our inventory. The added depth and granularity of Cuebiq’s data allows us to best measure the impact of ads on real consumer behavior.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> How does the technology work and how has it been vetted?</p>
      <p><b>Orfaly:</b> Cuebiq collects its first party data through its proprietary SDK in mobile apps, via a privacy-compliant opt-in/opt-out process from the user. When Targetspot delivers an impression to a potential customer, Cuebiq’s pixel is activated.</p>
      <p>Then, Targetspot’s proprietary ad serving solution, Passport, combines Cuebiq’s location-based insights with a retail location within the attribution window to credit an ad served with a conversion. Conversion data helps gather insights about certain locations, markets, creatives, demographics and much more.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> What can buyers, planners and clients do with this data?</p>
      <p><b>Orfaly:</b> By assessing a campaign’s efficacy in driving foot traffic to stores, buyers, planners and clients will be able to demonstrate impact both mid-flight and for future campaigns.</p>
      <p>For example, a quick service restaurant would be able to gather precise footfall attribution data for individual locations based on their digital audio campaigns, which leads to clearer marketing ROIs and paves the way for new opportunities.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> If the goal of a campaign does not involve driving traffic to a brick and mortar location, are there other applications for the technology?</p>
      <p><b>Orfaly:</b> Segmentation helps our clients reach audiences that are receptive to their messaging and products. In addition to measuring visitation lift and the ROI on digital audio campaigns, the addition of location-based insights enhances existing audience segmentation, which can be aggregated into behavioral, psychographic, occupational and more.</p>
      <p>Even if a brand is not looking to measure foot traffic, they can now more accurately target listeners.  </p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> Any other thoughts you’d like to share?</p>
      <p><b>Orfaly:</b> Audio ad spending in the U.S. totaled $2.25 billion in 2018, up 22.9% from 2017,  and these figures are projected to increase in 2019 and 2020.</p>
      <p>Additionally, 48% of ad agencies have stated that digital audio was an important part of their cross-channel marketing strategy. Podcasts, especially, have been proven to be a good way to engage listeners and drive purchases, as Midroll Media’s survey showed that 60% of listeners had purchased something after hearing it advertised on a podcast.</p>
      <p>We are obviously big believers in digital audio. There is significant audience out there beyond the major streaming platforms, and advertisers can see the value these publishers and their audiences provide.</p>
