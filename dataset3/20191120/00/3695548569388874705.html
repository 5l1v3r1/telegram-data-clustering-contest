        <b>Seven-time NASCAR champion and Hendrick Motorsports driver Jimmie Johnson will retire from the Cup Series at the conclusion of the 2020 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Johnson was <a href="https://www.autosport.com/nascar/news/146399/johnson-determined-to-delay-retirement-decision">keen to delay his call on when to retire</a> for as long as possible, although one of his major sponsors had committed to 2023.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old's seven cup championships is equal with Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for the most all-time. Five of those titles came in succession between 2006 and 2010, a NASCAR record, Johnson proving a master of NASCAR's playoff system.</p>
      <p>The California driver has also won 83 races - the most among active drivers and sixth all time - in a career dating back to 2001 spanning 651 races.</p>
      <p>He is also a two-time winner of the Daytona 500 in both 2006 and 2013.</p>
      <p>Johnson tweeted announced his decision on social media, saying, "I'm so thankful for 18 incredible careers of racing in NASCAR.</p>

      <p>"This sport has been good to me and allowed me to do something I truly love.</p>
      <p>"I showed up chasing a dream and achieved more than I ever thought possible.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking forward to next season and celebrating what will be my last year as a full-time NASCAR Cup driver.</p>
      <p>"I know what this team is capable of and I hope that 2020 is one of the best yet."</p>
      <p>However, he currently faces the longest winless streak of his career with his most recent victory coming at Dover in May, 2017.</p>
      <p>Hendrick Motorsports will announce plans for its 2021 team alignment at a later date.</p>
