      <p>Get ready to speak to ‘advanced natural language processing’ Einstein Bots set to take over Kayo Sports customer service as the sports streaming service aims to reach 100% self-service and customer support automation.</p>
      <p>Kayo is already on its way to achieving greater than 95% self-service and customer support automation in its first 12 months but is now introducing further artificial intelligence-led customer service with help from AI solutions business Salesforce.</p>
      <p>Julian Ogrin, Kayo CEO, revealed the plan at the annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, telling conference-goers that the customer service journey is at the heart of the company’s success.</p>
      <p>‘We have built a platform and a strategy that is customer future-focused.’</p>
      <p>Working closely with the Salesforce team, Kayo has constructed an innovated customer service strategy implemented in just 16 weeks from scope to execution.</p>
      <p>Of the customers that visit Kayo’s help centre, 95% can completely self-serve their issue through the automation process, with 40% of those that require further assistance being manged through Kayo’s support channel augmented by Einstein Bots.</p>
      <p>Easy to create, train and deploy, the Einstein Bots use advanced natural language processing (NLP) technology, ‘to handle the majority of cases and escalate complex cases to customer service agents.’</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://systempartners.com/kayo-sports-case-study">SystemPartners</a>, the customer service team sits directly within the data team allowing for high data-driven customer service targets.</p>
      <p>The Salesforce Einstein chatbot can draw on the customer data and handle transactions and updates in Service Cloud, as well as the self-service knowledge base within Salesforce Communities.</p>
      <p>While most users would prefer to speak with a real human when requesting customer service, occasionally, automation can streamline support requests and troubleshooting.</p>
      <p>Salesforce EVP &amp; GM, Ulrik Nehammer explained that ‘as service expectations rise, the use of AI and machine learning becomes increasingly important to meet and exceed those expectations’.</p>
      <p>Kayo Sports has a current subscriber base of 443,000 customers, with 402,000 of those paying since day one.</p>
      <p>In fact, when Mr Ogrin was speaking with <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/foxtel-on-the-ball-for-entertainment-push/news-story/adf398eec476be8a5273000b7dac1bf1">the Australian</a>, he identified Kayo’s streaming latency of fewer than 10 seconds, substantially less than its competitors who generally see a delay of up to 30 or 35 seconds.</p>
      <p>‘We’re doing that with 300 games, a delay of less than 10 seconds really is pretty amazing’.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, customers are reportedly watching seven sports a week and streaming an average of 5 hours and 20 minutes, according to Mr Ogrin, who also stated that Kayo Sports is, ‘just getting started’.</p>
