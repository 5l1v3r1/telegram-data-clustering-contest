      <h1>New Huawei Mate Pro 30 Only Scores 5/10 In Reliability Tear Down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/dwr/" target="_blank">David Richards</a></address>
      <p>The all new Huawei Mate Pro 30 which has a limited Android OS denying owners official access to services such as G Mail or Maps has only managed a 5/10 in a recent reliability tear down by iFixit.</p>
      <p>Under the weight of a myriad of tariffs and embargoes, Huawei released their Mate 30 Pro in Australia despite the banning of access to the key elements of the Google OS.<br/>In comparison</p>
      <p>The Chinese Company brags it has seven cameras and a unique display.</p>

      <p>The waterfall glass on the Huawei Mate 30 Pro was always going to be the biggest hurdle in repairing the device.</p>
      <p>What’s been revealed is that the display can be removed without removing the battery inside.</p>
      <p>iFixit said that the waterfall display leaves zero margin between the display and the frame, making it quite hard to pry it open. Also, unlike most smartphones of 2019 which have separate plugs for digitizer and screen, Huawei Mate 30 Pro’s display connects to the board via a single small-sized connector which if one is broken both are made inoperable.</p>
      <p>The reviewers said, “We momentarily scratched our heads as we wonder why Huawei only listed two front cameras in the spec sheet, until we realize that one of these must be the gesture sensor”.</p>
      <p>A double-wide camera couple houses the larger 32 MP ƒ/2.0 selfie cam on the right, (1/2.8″ IMX616 sensor) and the aforementioned 2.4 MP gesture camera on the left (1/6.95″ IMX332 sensor).</p>
      <p>Almost every component inside the device is modular and can be replaced independently. Plus, standard Phillips screws ensure you don’t have to carry multiple tools or remove a lot of glue inside the device.</p>
      <p>A few components require extended disassembly for service.</p>
      <p>The display can be removed without removing the battery, although it’s still tough to pry off and impeded by some cables.</p>
      <p>Glued-down front and back glass means greater risk of breakage, while making all repairs more difficult and lengthier.</p>
