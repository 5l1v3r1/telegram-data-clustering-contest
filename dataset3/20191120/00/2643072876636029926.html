      <h3>Court Sacks Kaduna Lawmakers</h3>
      <p>Two members of the <b>Kaduna State</b> House of Assembly were on Tuesday, sacked by the Court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna State.</p>
      <p>The sacked lawmakers represented Kagarko and Sanga constituencies respectively in the Kaduna state assembly.</p>
      <p>The sacked lawmakers are <b>Mr Morondia Tanko</b> representing Kagarko constituency and <b>Mrs Confort Amwe</b> of Sanga constituency both on the platform of the <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/pdp/"><u>Peoples Democratic Party</u></a></b> (PDP).</p>
      <p>The court also ordered the <b>Independent National Electoral Commission</b> (INEC) to conduct a rerun to determine who will represent Kagarko and Sanga constituencies in the state assembly, NAN reports.</p>
      <p>It will be recalled that Mr. Tanko had approached the appeal court after the state assembly election petition tribunal had ordered for fresh election in the 22 polling units located in two wards of the constituency in the case instituted by <b>Mr. Nuhu Shadalafiya</b> of the All Progressives Congress (APC) challenging Tanko’s victory.</p>
      <p>However, in the appeal court judgement read by <b>Justice Daniel Kaliop</b>, it affirmed the earlier ruling of the state assembly election Tribunal in respect of Kagarko constituency.</p>
      <p>The appellate court in a unanimous decision dismissed the case for lacking in merit</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Appeal Court has ordered for re-run in Sanga constituency after it upturned the earlier ruling of the Tribunal, which affirmed the election of Mrs Confort Amwe of the PDP following the challenge by <b>Alhaji Gambo Danga</b> of APC over the tribunal’s decision.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/"><u>Naija News</u></a></b> understands Mrs. Amwe is the only female lawmaker in the Kaduna state assembly.</p>
