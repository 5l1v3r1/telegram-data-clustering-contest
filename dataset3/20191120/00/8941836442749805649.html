      <p>PARIS (AP) - The French government is to boost funding into the country’s public hospitals over the next three years by 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) after years of cost cuts.</p>
      <p>The plan includes an annual 800-euro bonus for about 40,000 caretakers and nurses living in the Paris region with modest salaries.</p>
      <p>Public hospitals across France will also get a financial package allowing them to grant employees a bonus of up to 300 euros.</p>
      <p>The plan follows a series of protests since March, including a big demonstration last week in Paris involving exasperated nurses, doctors and other public hospital workers.</p>

        <p>The French state will also take over a third of the public hospital debt, which amounts to around 30 billion euros.</p>
