      <p>Some people who come from a famous pedigree see it as a responsibility to follow in their forefather’s footsteps, and some intentionally eschew the family business, whatever it is. Either way, that pedigree becomes a starting point for their career choices.</p>
      <p>Not Gabrielle (Ellie) Rubenstein.  In fact, she told me <a href="http://www.greenconnectionsradio.com/">on my podcast</a>, Green Connections Radio, that when she went to graduate school in Indiana to study agricultural economics, her famous investor-philanthropist father, classic urbanite <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/about-carlyle/team/david-m-rubenstein">David Rubenstein</a>, said “Ellie, you so don’t belong here.” Instead of leaving the program, she pushed back, and said, “Dad, I so <i>totally</i> belong here!” and is now teaching him new things.</p>

      <p>Today, as CEO and Co-founder of <a href="http://www.mannapartners.com/">Manna Partners</a> she’s an entrepreneur-investor on a mission to make our food supply more transparent, traceable, accessible and healthy, she’s doing work that blends both sides of her family. Her mother is an outdoorswoman-hunter-fisherwoman in Alaska who, Rubenstein said, gave her home remedies like boiling bone marrow to treat some of her health issues.</p>
      <p>When I interviewed Ellie Rubenstein on my podcast and for Forbes about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2019/11/10/how-to-make-the-food-supply-more-transparent-and-healthier/#26f7861033dc">how to make our food supply more transparent and healthier</a>, I discovered she had made choices we can all learn from.</p>
      <p><b>Here are 10 insights from her story, and a few tips she gave when I asked her directly for career advice for mid-career women</b>:   </p>
      <p>1. <u>Go your own way</u>. Ellie Rubenstein could easily have entered her father’s uber-successful private equity firm and never looked back. Instead, she followed her own muse and is happier and more fulfilled doing so.</p>
      <p>2. <u>Get outside your comfort zone.</u> “I really wish that more people would get outside of their comfort zone,” she insisted, adding, “You are just going to see the world in different viewpoints.” I would add that you’ll also learn you have much more potential – in intellect, skills, resilience and strength – than you ever imagined. A woman who personifies this is Tracy Edwards, who built and captained the first all-female crew to do the grueling, life-threatening, 33,000 mile Whitbread Round the World yachting race at 24 years old (and won the two most dangerous legs of it, coming in second overall).</p>

      <p>3. <u>Realize how much you know and how much expertise you already have</u>. “Most people don’t realize that the knowledge they’ve already gained….can actually be used to make money,” Rubenstein explained. She had not realized how much she learned about investing just by being around her dad until some of her female investors validated her thinking. Women in particular tend to underestimate how much they know and emphasize what they do not know, which is counterproductive. Own what you know.</p>
      <p>4. <u>Find your niche in a challenge you face</u>. If you’re facing it and struggling with it, chances are that others are too. So excavate that challenge and figure out how you can work on it.  Rubenstein discovered her passion for and aptitude in agriculture and the food supply chain when she was trying to find solutions to her myriad allergies and health issues. Now, she’s working to make the food supply chain as transparent, healthy and accessible as possible for everyone.</p>
      <p>5. <u>Ask any questions.</u> Rubenstein talked about how some people in food markets or restaurants seem bothered by her collection of questions about where their food came from, but their attitude doesn’t bother her. Ask what you need to know to make the best decisions you can, whether it’s about ingredients to keep you from an allergic reaction, or your quest for answers to solve another challenge. Your thought process is just as valid as anyone else’s.</p>
      <p>6. <u>Work with people you get along with.</u> Rubenstein said her investment firm will not invest in teams who do not share their values. The most successful collaborations – in a job or a venture  or any relationship – are those among people who truly seek each other’s input, and whose skills or expertise are complementary. It’s also about working with people “who build you up,” she said.</p>

      <p>7. <u>Keep a global perspective</u>. Whatever you’re doing, it’s being done differently someplace else that you can learn from. She has learned very useful things, both big and small, from traveling overseas or researching how food supply chains or business works in other countries.</p>
      <p>8. <u>“Create your own jobs,”</u> Even if you work for someone else, tweak your tasks and projects to reflect your own values, skills and interests. When I went to Chrysler’s EV division to lead their communications, we revised the job to match the unique assets – in terms of skills, contacts, ideas, experience and strengths – that I brought to it, and ended up driving “best year ever” growth.</p>
      <p>9. <u>Inclusive and diverse means everyone</u>.” Teams need to be truly diverse – in gender, race, experience and background. Everyone brings new ideas, perspectives and skills, even if we don’t always agree with them.</p>

        <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/after-lifetime-learning-atlanta-woman-earns-college-degree/uEIEeAjs5jB158iK2L2ArL/">After a lifetime of learning, Atlanta woman earns college degree at 93<br/>ajc</a>
      </p>
      <p>10. <u>It’s never too late</u>. In today’s world, with aging slowed so much and energy and vitality remaining high, don’t let age hold you or anyone you know back. At 59, Rubenstein’s mother just got her pilot’s license and bought a newspaper. I recently saw a story about a woman who just <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/after-lifetime-learning-atlanta-woman-earns-college-degree/uEIEeAjs5jB158iK2L2ArL/">graduated college at 93 years</a> young. Never give up.</p>

      <p>“I actually think mid-career is the best time. You have knowledge. You have somewhat of confidence to probably go exercise on that knowledge,” Ellie Rubenstein emphasized, adding, “It’s about (women) proving to themselves they can do it and do it really well.…I would encourage people to think about, what can only you do? And go do it.”</p>
