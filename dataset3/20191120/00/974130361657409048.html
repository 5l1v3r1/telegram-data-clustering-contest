      <h1>West Ham Delete Jose Mourinho Video After Backlash</h1>

      <p>Jose Mourinho's first game as Tottenham manager got that bit more interesting after fellow Premier League club West Ham posted a video goading him ahead of their clash this week.</p>
      <p>It was confirmed earlier today that Mourinho would replace Mauricio Pochettino as Spurs boss. The deal was for a three-and-a-half-year contract worth up to £13 million-a-year. He took control of his first training session today ahead of their trip to the London Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Hammers released a video ahead of that tie that was later deleted. It played footage of Mourinho's previous failures against West Ham including footage from Man United's defeat at the ground last season.</p>
      <p>The video was captioned “See you Saturday, José" and included a Mourinho quote about West Ham's style of play. However, it was taken down after a huge backlash online.</p>
