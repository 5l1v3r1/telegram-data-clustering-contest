      <h1>Disney+ Receives D- For Security</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ accounts have already been hacked within a week of its launch, adding a brand new commodity to the streaming accounts black market.</p>
      <p>Reaching 10 million subscribers on its first day, the now ‘unsecured’ Disney+ streaming service is receiving reports of technical difficulties, glitches, outages and now, account hijacking.</p>
      <p>An investigation by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/"><u>ZDNet</u></a> revealed the hacking issue highlighting a number of users complaining on Disney+ forums and Twitter that their accounts had been hacked, with one user losing access just ten hours after logging in for the first time.</p>

      <p>While the early reports do not confirm or identify the culprit for the slew of account hacks, it does reveal a security flaw within the Disney+ platform.</p>
      <p>Hacking forums are reportedly being inundated with the hijacked Disney+ accounts, with prices ranging from US$3 to US$7, despite the monthly cost for the streaming service being only US$5.99 a month.</p>
      <p>Though in some cases, hackers were sharing accounts for free as Disney permits account sharing, happy borrowing?</p>
      <p>Disney has not yet issued a statement on the hacking issue, though ChannelNews would advise any current user to use a strongly unique password to avoid account hijacking in future. </p>
      <p>Though, two-factor authentication couldn’t go astray for Disney+.</p>
