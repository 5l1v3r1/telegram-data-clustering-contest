      <p>The inaugural <a href="https://www.digitalimpactweek.com/">Digital Impact Week</a> was held in London between the 7th and the 11th of November and packed in three big events: Women in Blockchain; Healthcare Unblocked; and the Digital Impact Summit. The event was the first of its kind in London to set the stage for how digital technologies are combing with capital and are creating positive global social change. For a geek capitalist like me with one foot in the money-making machine and the other in the sustainable impact investment machine, I was like a kid in a candy shop. I spoke to several global leaders and influencers, and what is of note is the many initiatives that are currently up, running and in-train. Digital impact is here, now, and happening.</p>
      <p>In an often bleak political epoch, what a ray of light—capital and digital are working in partnership and we are moving the dial on impact.</p>
      <p><a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a>, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume has established a non-profit organization dedicated to achieving global sustainable development by unlocking the power of blockchain to help deliver the <a href="https://unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/sustainable-development-goals/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtrnuBRDXARIsABiN-7Dc1r5YL6XnoLfqgiN08mgt6n2xP3mlKaIJZjaRwY_Gw-DHVKrjZGgaAsmVEALw_wcB">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.binance.charity/">Binance Charity Foundation (BCF)</a> delivers a transparent donation system on the blockchain where 100% of the more than $5 million in donations to date has been delivered to over 90,000 beneficiaries, in projects for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccacampbell1/2019/02/25/binance-blockchain-pilot-lunch/#f98b1fb20bb5">children in Uganda</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/385728335832162304/Binance-Charity-Joins-Forces-with-Mercy-Corps-to-Launch-Impact-Token-to-Aid-the-Displaced">partnerships with Mercy Corps</a>, and support for young girls in emerging economies with the <a href="https://www.binance.charity/period-poverty">Pink Care Token</a>.</p>
      <p>“The Pink Care Token delivers feminine hygiene products to young women in developing economies who are not able to afford feminine care – this helps to build confidence and dignity in young girls and transparency in charity,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yongjie-athena-yu-813183171/">Athena Yu</a>, an executive director with BCF.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.cceg.org.uk/">Centre for Citizenship, Enterprise and Governance (CCEG)</a> is the world’s leading think tank on the movement of value with over 160,000 members. Since 2011 CCEG has been developing the <a href="https://youtu.be/pF7qoBRauT8">Currency of Non-Financial Value</a> starting the measurement. They developed the corollary to the Price Earnings Ratio (p/e), the Social Earnings Ratio (s/e). Known as the God Metric, it is one of the fastest adopted social impact metrics in the world underpinning legislation in U.K., the EU, India, Indonesia, and Mauritius.</p>
      <p>“We understand the currency of financial value is the dollar, but what is the currency of non-financial value? If you can resolve that, then you can transact soft intangible value side by side with hard financial tangible value. What blockchain does is to move digital assets from A to B, like money, land, diamonds, but of equal value is love, happiness, kindness. Total value captures both, p/e and e/e combined.</p>
      <p>“The <a href="https://www.seratio-coins.world/">Seratio Blockchain</a> allows impact to become transactable by aligning values with value. This is the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle called impact investment, to help stimulate impact based consumerism,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/professor-olinga-taeed-phd-fiod-34b9366/">Professor Olinga Taaed</a>, a director at the CCEG.</p>
      <p>A disturbing trend is emerging where companies and governments have begun using deeply flawed impact indices and measures to report on progress towards the SDGs and more broadly <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp">Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)</a> factors. This leads to a misalignment of capital and a reduction in the pace of progress towards the intended goals.</p>
      <p>At the same time corporate executives and government leaders are interested in implementing new innovation programs to meet the SDGs. Many of these decision-makers are turning to the idea of ecosystems, fostering an enabling environment for innovation and economic development, where multiple stakeholders work together to build value.</p>
      <p>“Using big data and AI, we can now measure, instead of guessing, which interventions produce the greatest impact. Using blockchain, we can make this data transparent, and provide an unchangeable record of what’s been done, what has worked, and what hasn’t.</p>
      <p>“My new Engineering Innovation Ecosystems project will use advanced analytics and large-scale data sets to deliver a definitive set of answers around which choices by government and private sector leaders produce the optimal outcomes, starting with GDP and income growth - investors and asset allocators are demanding greater accountability and more accurate measures of impact,” says futurist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-shrier/">David Shrier</a>, who holds a dual appointment with <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> and with <a href="https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/">Said Business School, University of Oxford</a>.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to big data, we now have access to a generous source of information on environmental, social and governance items that–if leveraged correctly–could help meet sustainable development goals,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yves-guillaume-a-messy-b27a53b3/">Yves Messy</a>, architect and engineer at <a href="https://www.r3.com/">R3 </a>&amp; <a href="https://site.globalcsr.net/">Global CSR</a>.</p>
      <p>“Financial institutions’ large-scale adoption of blockchain technology presents organisations with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put sustainability at the heart of their digital transformation journey.</p>
      <p>For charities and non-profit organisations, blockchain technology can give identities to previously excluded populations, help build more accurate and transparent reports of carbon footprints of payments and investments, and even create female-centric financial products,” adds Messy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gooddollar.org/">GoodDollar</a> is a not-for-profit experiment in reducing global wealth inequality using a combination of the blockchain and <a href="https://youtu.be/UvErJvuWrWc">Universal Basic Income (UBI)</a> principles to address the grim statistics that 94 percent of the world’s wealth is owned by 20 percent of its people – by giving the poorest people in the world a dollar a day, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wAzx1_EdylmTQq-JIFlMIP1fIw_L3bKxFVHZt3Ac2-g/edit#slide=id.g5feb96aa12_0_20">the impact of community Gini score, a measurement for the distribution of wealth, is impacted in five years</a>.</p>
      <p>GoodDollar, a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, has zero percent transaction fees and can be used for the exchange of goods and services on the The GoodMarket marketplace, where there a pilot is running with over 700 participants who are incentivised to offer their unwanted goods or skills, in order to buy high-value goods.</p>
      <p>"Blockchain is a truly transformational technology that will have a seismic impact on a vast number of industries and shape the future of money and investments. What is most exciting to me, however, is blockchain’s potential to supercharge humanity. I believe if we embrace it we can find solutions to some of our greatest challenges says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/advzivkeinan/">Ziv Keinan</a>, GoodDollar’s legal counsel.</p>
      <p>Although there are many forms of DLT technology, ultimately it is around digital infrastructure, connection, and the secure use of data in a much more automated economy. One where value can be captured in novel ways such as <a href="https://systemsinnovation.io/tokenization-articles/">tokenisation</a>, peer-to-peer activities that are much more streamlined, where existing processes can be automated and digitised, accountability is transparent and centralised functions can be unpacked for reasons of trust or security to be more decentralised.</p>
      <p>“The entire narrative around how we measure success and value within the economy is being reimagined, and in order to drive any meaningful change around the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300">SDG’s</a>, the measurability of trust, freedom, and new forms of value, it needs to be embedded into the mandate across the entire <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/why-the-circular-economy-needs-to-link-up-the-whole-supply-chain/">value chain</a> across the economy, be targeted, and incredibly specific with the right accountability,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hdnakib/">Hazem Danny Al Nakib</a>, a partner with venture capital firm <a href="https://7bc.vc/">7BC</a>.  </p>
      <p>"Initiatives throughout Europe have been surging throughout 2019 including <a href="https://decodeproject.eu/">Decode</a> to protect individuals data, the launch in April of the <a href="https://inatba.org/">International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications</a> with the European Commission, which is also running the <a href="https://www.eublockchainforum.eu/">EU Blockchain Observatory &amp; Forum</a>, and <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">Euro 83M in research funding and further Euro 45M</a> toward blockchain and AI companies but not much in the U.K.” says Al Nakib.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitalimpactweek.com/">Digital Impact Week</a> was hosted by <a href="https://www.fintechworldwide.com/">Fintech Worldwide</a> ceo and <a href="http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London, Centre for Blockchain</a> associate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-jane-thomason-85997276/">Dr. Jane Thomason</a> who added, “The ultimate goal of the event was to stimulate a conversation about how to accelerate the positive benefits for society and it certainly achieved all of that and much more, including making a lot of great new global friendships and connections with people actually doing great stuff and executing in this space.”</p>
