      <h1>Why It’s Time for Asian Prime Day — AKA Gold Rush</h1>
      <h2>"Diversity isn't just beautiful. It's smart business."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/mikkoh-chen/" target="_blank">Mikkoh Chen</a></address>
      <p>We remember watching our parents try to hold their heads high when they came home from a long day’s work. They worked tirelessly without complaint so that we could focus on excelling in school, getting that coveted job, and frankly, living an easier life. And when we went from cap-and-gown to suit-and-tie, we thought we finally pulled ourselves out from our humble upbringings onto an equal playing field. The reality of Corporate America, however, is far from such a naive misconception. Yes, all the “Diversity and Inclusion” initiatives are well-intended — and have made some progress — but like so many of our diverse colleagues, we face subtle biases with profound implications on our success. No matter how often we spoke, we still needed to “speak up” more. No matter how many initiatives we spearheaded, we still needed to show more “leadership” and “confidence.” They applauded our “strong work ethic” but kept our potential at bay. It became clear that we, as a community, need to champion and lift ourselves up to break through these barriers.</p>
      <p>Asians are the least likely to get promoted to management in the country (Harvard Business Review). We are nearly 1/3 of the Silicon Valley workforce but half of that in executive ranks–and it’s just as dire in financial services. We also don’t <i>look</i> the same or get <i>paid</i> the same: while some Asian subgroups appear to make more than their white male peers, <a href="http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/understanding-challenges-of-aapi-women-to-achieve-equal-pay">those are outliers</a>. For instance, women of Indonesian descent make 81.4% as much; Pacific Islanders, 62.1% as much; Burmese, 49.3%. This, of course, is why myths like our Model Minoritism are, well, myths, and are often used to easily dismiss any biases against our people.</p>
      <p>So we’re faced with two options: we can climb the corporate ladder and wait for a seat at the table — or we can build our own table. There are more than 2 million Asian-founded businesses in the U.S.–39% of them are founded by women. In fact, nearly 20% of the unicorn businesses founded in the last decade (i.e. more than $1 billion valuation) were Asian-founded: Twitch, Snapchat, Stitch Fix, Sweetgreen, and Pinterest, are among them. But we don’t just make–we consume. We are the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country and over-index in our economic contribution, whether it’s in online media consumption or theatre-going (we are the second most-frequent moviegoers in the country). </p>
      <p>That’s why we built Gold Rush: we realize that diversity isn’t just beautiful — it’s smart business. It’s odds in our favor. Gold Rush is a promotional system that includes a quarterly flash sale that delights consumers with exclusive and discounted products and once-in-a-lifetime gifts; provides intimate access for Asian founders to venture capitalists and industry leaders for strategic guidance; and convenes a cohort of like-minded, promising founders who can help each other grow. It’s happening every quarter to align with the Solstices and Equinoxes as an homage to our ancestor’s commitment to nature (Lunar New Year, anyone?) and focuses on real Maslowian needs: fashion and wellness; food and beverage; shelter and experiences. </p>
      <p>The first Gold Rush occurs a week before Black Friday from November 20-22 from Noon EST to Noon EST at goldhouse.org/GoldRush and features passionate fashion icons like Phillip Lim and Prabal Gurung; beauty founders like Soko Glam and Musely; as well as wellness startups including smart vibrator Lioness (sexual wellness is wellness!) and a plant marketplace called Rooted. It’s a mosaic not dissimilar from the diversity within our diaspora of dozens of ethnicities and hundreds of dialectics. </p>
      <p>150 years ago, the first transcontinental railroad line was complete, an effort that exploited Asian labor to accelerate America’s own Gold Rush — an effort that America often forgets. That’s why we’re taking it back. It’s to honor our ancestor’s commitment to delivering the American Dream for so many in this country. It’s to show that we’re still here — and driving the economy and culture forward more than ever.</p>
