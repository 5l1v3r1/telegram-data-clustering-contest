      <p>While nearly every fan and media member flocked to Madison Square Garden on a chilly Thursday evening to check out Dallas Mavericks star Kristaps Porzingis to New York to play the Knicks, a small group of journalists and PepsiCo representatives only had cheese on their minds.A brisk escalator ride from MSG’s main entrance brought the group to section 202. That’s where Chester’s Spot, a Cheetos-themed concession stand with black and orange spotted walls and a gold framed photo of the tiger mascot Chester regally lounging on a leather chair, now lives as a permanent Garden fixture. After Cheetos unveiled temporary pop-up restaurants in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3NzyQsqpI">New York in 2017 </a>curated by Food Network chef Anne Burrell and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aajmy01BsE">2018 Los Angeles installment</a> led by food truck impresario and Netflix star Roy Choi, a long-term ballpark concession stand was the next logical step according to Chas Cahn, a senior director of marketing at PepsiCo specializing in what the company calls “away from home food marketing.”</p>

      <p>“When you look at overall consumer experiences and where consumers are going,” Cahn said at the arena, “it is in sports, entertainment, music venues. So thinking through the dynamics of how can we actually come to life in a stadium, in an arena, in an exciting way, it felt like a perfect fit.”</p>
      <p>After PepsiCo took over the Garden’s beverage contract from Coca-Cola in the summer of 2018, ending Coke’s 108-year run with the World’s Most Famous Arena, it brought the idea of a standalone Cheetos eatery to MSG this past February, Cahn said.</p>
      <p>“When we had the idea from the food service perspective to elevate the overall concession stand,” he said, “Cheetos was a good overall fit because of restaurant partnerships. and Cheetos’ desire to keep disrupting and creating mischief wherever they go.”</p>
      <p>After months of planning and preparing the right ballpark-style concession fare, Cheetos launched its stand in September to coincide with the beginning of the season for the NBA’s Knicks and the NHL’s New York Rangers. It debuted a five-item menu that the group proceeded to sample at an MSG luxury suite, featuring Cheetos popcorn ($8), a Cheetos-crusted pretzel with a Cheetos dipping sauce ($7), a flamin’ Cheetos hot dog ($9), a mac n’ Cheetos dish that was also on the Los Angeles menu ($12) and most famously, a $9 Cheetos ice cream sundae that went viral in late October.</p>
      <p>Cahn acknowledged that when you’re trying to <a href="https://uproxx.com/dimemag/knicks-rangers-cheetos-ice-cream-sundaes-photos/">introduce something new</a> into the pop culture sphere, you’re going to get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyfoodporn/comments/dmi53b/madison_square_garden_is_now_selling_cheetos/">different reactions online</a> and in social media. They wanted to have at least one menu item at Chester’s Spot that every fan at Madison Square Garden could enjoy, which is why there are more standard items like popcorn and pretzels and those like the vanilla ice cream with a Cheetos sauce and a crunchy topping that proved to be more polarizing.</p>
      <p>“Those that prefer more conventional twists love those items, and those that love twists on food items that push the envelope love those too,” Cahn said. “So we’re excited about being able to deliver that wide range of variety.”</p>

      <p>Between February and September, Cheetos whittled down 20 potential food options to the five on display, but Cahn would not disclose the 15 dishes that didn’t make the menu because they didn’t permanently miss the cut. So if you noticed Cheetos fries, meatballs, wings, grilled cheese and elote corn on the cob in other videos and speculated that they could one day be available at The Garden, there’s still hope.</p>
      <p>“The intention is for as the menu is out there and consumers engage with it and we see what sticks and what we might want to swap out,” Cahn said, “those are other ideas that actually have the ability throughout the season to be woven in.”</p>

      <p>Cahn and a PepsiCo spokesman declined to disclose the profit and revenue split from the Cheetos stand between MSG and PepsiCo, but PepsiCo does generate money from the Cheetos items it sells to the Garden and then there are other items Pepsi doesn’t supply that the arena has to purchase elsewhere.</p>
      <p>PepsiCo wasn’t ready to discuss revenue goals and estimates from Chester’s Spot just yet, but they do see and envision an added benefit and value from the brand awareness the concession stand brings from what Cahn called the shareability of the experience through social media or word of mouth.</p>
      <p>“It’s a similar impact to advertising and digital media,” he said.</p>
      <p>There’s no current end date in sight for Chester’s Spot, and PepsiCo will evaluate how things go with the Cheetos experience as the Knicks’ and Rangers’ seasons progress. It’ll also give the company an experimental look at how a branded concession stand could work outside The Garden. Cahn said that PepsiCo has brought up the idea on leveraging the company’s portfolio in similar ways and is already having preliminary conversations with two stadiums. Perhaps that means a Mountain Dew-themed concession stand in your local arena, or stadium bars featuring Pepsi products like Gatorade, Tropicana or Sierra Mist.</p>
      <p>“We currently don’t have an official partner yet,” Cahn said, “but we are certainly open to expanding it.”</p>
