      <p>There is every reason to believe Deontay Wilder is going to knock Luis Ortiz even sooner than he did in their first fight in March 2018. The WBC champion was badly hurt in the seventh round of that fight before stopping Ortiz in the 10th. Wilder has a date with Tyson Fury for a major rematch in February, if he beats Ortiz. Wilder couldn’t actually lose, could he?</p>
      <p>Ortiz is 40 years old and Wilder is 34. Usually, the older man sees worse results in a rematch with a younger fighter that he’s already lost to previously. There are exceptions, but the thought process behind this concept is solid. An older man’s skills will have depreciated over time, and if he didn’t have enough to win the first time, why would he be better in the rematch?</p>
      <p>Wilder tends to get better against later in fights after he’s had time to find a weakness, and in the only rematch of his career, he demolished Bermane Stiverne. Prior to the draw with Fury, Stiverne was the only opponent Wilder hadn’t knocked out.</p>
      <p>All of these factors seem to work against Ortiz. That’s why I’m picking Wilder to win by third-round KO.</p>
      <p>However, that’s not to say Ortiz has no chance.</p>

      <p>In the heavyweight division, everything can change with one punch. Lesser fighters have taken down major champions on the strength of a single shot. Hasim Rahman vanquished Lennox Lewis, as did Oliver McCall and the list goes on. We nearly saw Ortiz pick off Wilder in their first fight, and his brief advantage didn’t come as a result of a lucky shot.</p>
      <p>Ortiz’s boxing skills, southpaw stance, deceptively quick hands and counter-punching ability created this opportunity. It’s not beyond the scope of realism to think that he could create another moment for himself.</p>

      <p>Wilder is a huge puncher–one of the biggest in boxing history–but when is the last time you saw someone try to get inside to muscle him around to make the fight dirty? I’m not sure I’ve ever seen an opponent do that to Wilder.</p>
      <p>It’s understandable considering the massive price you could possibly pay by walking into something huge from the towering champion. However, it seems like a viable strategy considering Wilder’s reach is so long, his jab is underrated and being caught on the end of that right hand often spells the end of a challenger’s night.</p>
      <p>If Ortiz can make the fight ugly and physical, it might work in his favor.</p>

      <p>Getting a seek-and-destroy fighter like Wilder deep into a fight is easier said than done. He comes looking to do damage, and 42 opponents have tried to avoid feeling his power, and none of them have succeeded.</p>
      <p>If Ortiz can avoid taking the major shot, while also getting inside and working Wilder’s body, he’ll put himself in the best position to pull the big upset.</p>
      <p>Again, I’d never bet or advise anyone to wager on Ortiz. However, if the unthinkable happens, look for one of these three scenarios to play out.</p>
