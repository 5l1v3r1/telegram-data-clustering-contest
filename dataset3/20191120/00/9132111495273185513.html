      <p>On November 20, 2012, the General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Johnson Asiedu Nketia, won a defamation suit he brought against the Daily Guide newspaper after it alleged in a publication that he had embezzled state funds to buy a mansion.</p>
      <p>The paper alleged that Asiedu Nketia used his position as chairman of the Bui Power Authority Board to divert building materials for his personal building project.</p>
      <p>In a story headlined “Asiedu Nketia’s Plush Mansion,” and published on March 2 2011, a Fast-Track High Court in Accra on that day awarded him damages to the tune of GH¢250,000 and a cost of GH¢15,000.</p>

      <p>After shouting on rooftops and totally tagging all members of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) as thieves and people baptized with gross corruption, the General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Johnson Asiedu Nketia is a proud owner of the multi-billion three-storey mansion that would be the envy of the richest in society.</p>
      <p>Mr. Asiedu Nketia who was jobless during the ruling NDC’s time in opposition some four years ago, has now managed to erect a mansion of a magnitude that would be the envy of an Arab Sheik.</p>
      <p>The Daily Searchlight is reliably informed that Mr. Asiedu Nketia affectionately called ‘General Mosquito’ started this construction of huge edifice barely five months into his party’s administration.</p>
      <p>This mansion is located at Oyarifa in the Abokobi Madina-Aburi highway. The building is so outstanding amongst other buildings in the area that one could see it from an outright distance.</p>
      <p>Though the area is undergoing massive development with very beautiful edifices, none can be compared to that of the NDC general secretary.</p>
      <p>The area, which had no easy access roads now, has well created untarred access roads leading mainly to the mansion of General Mosquito because that is the haven for high profiled NDC meetings, especially during the weekends.</p>
      <p>In the evenings, the place looks like heaven on earth due to the aesthetic nature of the lighting systems in the mansion.</p>
      <p>The decorations to the two-storey mansion are beyond description and can only be reserved for the eyes.</p>
      <p>Mr. Asiedu Nketia is on record to have stated emphatically, “If I am putting up a mansion what is wrong with that? Am I the only person building in this country? I have every right to build because I have the means. My family would even perceive me to be an idiot if after 4 years in power I do not have any building of my own. I don’t think there is anything wrong with putting up a house if you have the means to do.”</p>
      <p>This was what he said when the Daily Searchlight first reported on the construction of this particular mansion barely two years ago. True to his words, Mr. Asiedu Nketia is now living comfortably in his dream mansion and still sees nothing wrong with that.</p>
