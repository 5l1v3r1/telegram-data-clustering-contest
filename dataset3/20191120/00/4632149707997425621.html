      <p>If you are a government pensioner, November is the month when you will be planning a visit to your bank or post office to submit your life certificate (Jeevan Pramaan Patra). The annual pilgrimage to the disbursing authority for physical submission of the life certificate is an inconvenient and time consuming exercise for senior citizens. Failure to submit the certificate by November 30 can put a stop to pension payments. However, pensioners can avoid the whole process now. For the past few years, the government has provided a platform that enables pensioners to submit the certificate online. <br/><br/><br/>To obtain the digital certificate, pensioners must generate a unique Pramaan ID. This ID is generated for the individual pensioner using his or her Aadhaar number and biometrics. You can generate this ID for the first time by visiting the local Citizen Service Centre that facilitates Aadhaar transactions or at the branch of the pension disbursing agency. The pensioner has to provide Aadhaar number, mobile number pension payment order (PPO) number and pension account number apart from fingerprint. After successful authentication, an SMS acknowledgement is sent to your mobile number, which includes your Pramaan ID. <br/><br/>Once generated, you do not have to submit the DLC to the pension disbursing agency. You can do so digitally through the Jeevan Pramaan portal (jeevanpramaan.gov.in). The agency can also access the life certificate from the portal. Pensioners can also generate the certificate on the mobile phone or PC through the Umang app on Android and Windows, respectively. <br/><br/><br/>For senior citizens who are bedridden or unable to visit bank branch, a doorstep service for Aadhaar based authentication is also offered by disbursing agencies. Also, several banks organise Jeevan Pramaan certificate camps.</p>
