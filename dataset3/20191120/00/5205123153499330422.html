        <b>A DOG, who had been missing for 15 days, has been reunited with his family.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Beloved Collie Roy, who had run off after being spooked by fireworks around Halloween, was brought back to his home in Omeath, Co Louth after a frantic two-week search.</p>
      <p>The family searched high and low for Roy, who had once refused to leave the side of his owner after he became trapped under an overturned quad-bike for hours, covering a 400-mile area, before finally finding him on a farm around 4km from where he was last seen.</p>
      <p>Roy's owner Paul O’Hanlon spoke of his delight when they were finally reunited with Roy, who he insists is "part of the family".</p>
      <p>"We live up the mountains in Omeath and Roy has been with us 10 years since he was a puppy," Paul said.</p>
      <p>"He's much more than a pet to us, he's part of this family.</p>

      <p>"Roy was out farming with dad when a firework went off and spooked the dog who ran off.</p>
      <p>"After a day or so, we put up posters and launched a campaign to try and find him. There were lots of rumoured sightings and we answered all of them."</p>
      <p>Paul then described the day Roy refused to leave the side of his father Francis, after he overturned his quad-bike and became stuck.</p>
      <p>"Dad was especially devastated. About five years ago, Roy was with him rounding up sheep and the quad toppled over, trapping dad underneath with a broken collar bone and ribs.</p>
      <p>"He was unable to reach his phone to call for help.</p>
      <p>"Roy could get out but he refused to leave Dad’s side until a hill walker noticed them four hours later so Dad has a particular bond.</p>
      <p>"As the weeks passed, we were kind of giving up hope and then last Saturday we got a call from a farmer in Ravensdale about a dog who was with his cattle.</p>
      <p>"When we arrived, we were shouting his name but he wasn’t reacting but as we got closer, he recognised us.</p>
      <p>"He came bounding over and it was just pandemonium."</p>
      <p>*<i>We love a happy ending.</i></p>
