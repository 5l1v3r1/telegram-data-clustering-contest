      <h1>Towns where homes are selling twice as fast as the rest of the Britain</h1>
      <h2>It's no secret that people selling homes are having a tough time, but that doesn't mean would be buyers can relax, with properties in some towns still being being snapped up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>There are just 31 days between the average home in Edinburgh going on the market and someone buying it, making it the fastest-moving property market in Britain at the moment.</p>
      <p>By contrast, homes in Middlesbrough take 114 to find a buyer and London properties not much less at 107 days, according to a new report from Hometrack and <a href="http://www.barclays.co.uk/mortgages">Barclays</a> mortgages.</p>
      <p>Overall the amount of time to sell is getting longer, with a national average of 84 days to sell, nine days longer than last year.</p>
      <p>But despite the nationwide slowdown, there were some places that were things were improving.</p>
      <p>Newcastle saw the biggest improvement, with the time to sell a home dropping 19 days compared to last year, followed by Middlesbrough (16 days quicker) and Liverpool (13 days quicker).</p>
      <p>Derby saw the biggest slowdown, with homes there taking 34 days longer to sell this year than last, followed by Hull (18 days slower) then Nottingham and Sunderland (both 13 days slower).</p>

      <p>Shepherd Ncube, founder of estate agent <a href="https://www.springbokproperties.co.uk/">Springbok Properties</a>, said: “The UK market continues to be a real mixed bag and we’re seeing diverse conditions across neighbouring markets at county level or lower, let alone from one region to the next.</p>
      <p>"Yes, the time to sell has generally extended and this is of course due to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> uncertainty and a refusal from buyers in the more inflated areas of the market to adust their asking price and sell for less."</p>
      <p>Regionally, Scotland had the fastest selling homes, though the time to secure a sale was a week longer than last year.</p>
      <p>"The landscape is tough, but the foundation of a strong buyer appetite remains and when the cogs start to turn once again, the time it’s taking to sell will reduce and the sold price being secured will once again lift,” Ncube said.</p>
