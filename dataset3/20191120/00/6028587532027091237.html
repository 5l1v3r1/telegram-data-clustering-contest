      <p>During the Dubai Airshow, Emirates has adjusted its order commitments with Boeing, firming up orders for 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion in list prices, and reducing the number of 777X on order by 30, down to 126 aircraft, by exercising its substitution rights.</p>

      <p>Boeing’s 777X aircraft program has experienced delays stemming from engine problems and other complications during load testing. Emirates, as the launch customer for the aircraft has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-boeing-transport-aero/emirates-president-says-he-does-not-expect-to-take-any-boeing-777x-in-2020-idUSKBN1WT0KJ">previously expressed frustration</a> and adjusted expectations on delivery.</p>
      <p>In firming up its Dreamliner order, Emirates also switched from the 787-10 variant to the smaller 787-9 variant.</p>
      <p>“The 787s will complement our fleet mix by expanding our operational flexibility in terms of capacity, range and deployment. We are also pleased to reaffirm our commitment to the Boeing 777X programme and look forward to its entry into service,” said His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive, during the order signing.</p>
      <p>Emirates is still the world’s largest Boeing 777 operator, with a fleet of 155 aircraft in service today.</p>
      <p>“Our agreement solidifies Emirates' plan to operate the 787 Dreamliner and the 777X, which make up the most efficient and most capable widebody combination in the industry,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President &amp; CEO Stan Deal. </p>
      <p>Earlier this week at the airshow, Emirates <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2019/11/18/airbus-books-order-16-billion-order-for-50-a350xwb-from-emirates/">announced an order for 50 Airbus A350-900</a> aircraft valued at $16 billion at list prices. Emirates is also the world’s largest operator of the Airbus A380, an aircraft program which the airline had largely sustained.  </p>
      <p>In addition to the Dreamliner orders, Boeing and Emirates also agreed that Boeing Global Services will provide worldwide replacement parts support for the Emirates 777 fleet.</p>
