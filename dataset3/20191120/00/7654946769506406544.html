      <p>This Thanksgiving, it’s all about the sprouts.</p>
      <p>Back in the day, no foodie would dream of serving up controversial, cruciferous Brussels sprouts at their annual feast. That’s because people used to misguidedly boil the leafy spheres — a technique that emphasized their bitter flavors and created a stench that’d put anyone off their dinner. But a few years ago, chefs had a collective aha moment and started preparing the maligned veggies differently: roasted, thin-shaved, stir-fried. Now diners can’t get enough of these green queens.</p>
      <p>Here, NYC restaurants share their crowd-pleasing recipes for the star sprout.</p>
