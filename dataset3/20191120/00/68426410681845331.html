      <p>All our lives we’ve been told New York is the city that doesn’t sleep. Not true, says the mainstream police drama <i>21 Bridges</i>. Manhattan goes to bed, apparently setting its alarm clock for 5 o’clock the next morning. That’s the self-imposed deadline for Chadwick Boseman’s sharp detective Andre Davis to solve a cocaine heist gone bad and a multiple cop killing that happened at midnight. To keep the two suspects in Manhattan, it is decided to block off the island’s exits to keep them from vanishing rat-like into the other boroughs and points beyond.</p>
      <p>The premise is a manufactured one, amplified by police cars roaring to the city’s bridges – somewhere between 20 and 22 by my count – with lights flashing and tires skidding. After that it’s all about the chase and the spoon-fed suspicion that <i>something doesn’t quite add up</i>.</p>
      <p>The always excellent Bosman (<i>Jackie Robinson</i>, <i>James Brown</i>, <i>Black Panther</i>) is the avenging son of a slain cop who has built up quite a body count over his career on the force. His reputation as a shoot-first guy is the reason he’s assigned to find the two men who gunned down eight police officers – one imagines his idea of a Miranda warning is something along the lines of, “You have the right to remain dead.”</p>
      <p>There’s enough action to keep things moving along, but the drama is ho-hum, juiced up with a turgid soundtrack and sirens howling in the night. It’s all just so average.</p>
      <p>21 Bridges <i>opens Nov. 22.</i></p>
