      <p>Devlin explained that the protest is a result of "insufficient action" on the part of Irish political leaders.</p>
      <p>"My main motivation to go on hunger strike is my anxiety for the future of our planet and in particularly the legacy I am leaving for my grandchildren,” she added.</p>
      <p>The decision was not taken likely, with Devlin undergoing a check-up with her doctor before deciding to stage the action.</p>
      <p>Devlin is being supported by other Extinction Rebellion Ireland activists who will hold up banners and placards throughout her hunger strike.</p>
