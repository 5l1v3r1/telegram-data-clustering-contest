      <p>We have yet another Twitter map that is showcasing that the NFL remains the dominate sport over the NBA in terms of popularity across the United States.</p>
      <p>Betonline.ag used geotagged Twitter data that they gathered over the past month, which included mentions and hastags for both leagues, and used that information to create a map of team popularity across the United States.</p>
      <p>The NFL dominates in pretty much every state except, Utah, Arizona, Hawaii, Oklahoma, and New York.</p>
      <p>There are several NFL franchises where their popularity extends outside of the state that they in. Those teams include the Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings, Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans Saints, and New England Patriots.</p>
