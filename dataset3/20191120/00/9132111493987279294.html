      <p>The Executive Director of the Institute of Democratic Governance (IDEG), Dr Emmanuel Akwetey, insists that a "Yes" vote in the upcoming national referendum will enhance Ghana's democracy.</p>
      <p>He has, therefore, called on all stakeholders, particularly the political parties and institutions that are against the "Yes" vote, to reconsider their position and see the overall benefits of supporting the referendum.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a public lecture organised by IDEG in Accra yesterday, Dr Akwetey said the country "stands to benefit a lot from amending Article 55 (3) of the Constitution to pave the way for political parties’ participation in district level elections”.</p>
      <p>Background</p>
      <p>Ghana will, on December 17, this year, head to the polls to vote in a referendum to amend Article 55 (3) of the Constitution to allow for the election of metropolitan, municipal and district chief executives (MMDCEs).</p>
      <p>Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution, which is an entrenched provision, states: “Subject to the provisions of this article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character and sponsor candidates for election to any public office other than the district assemblies or lower local government units.”</p>
      <p>On the same day of the referendum, there will be the election of members of the district assemblies and unit committees.</p>
      <p>Since the campaign began, there have been divergent opinions by stakeholders on the referendum.</p>
      <p>Whereas some are calling for a "Yes" vote, with the explanation that it will transform Ghana's democracy, others contend that allowing parties to participate in district elections will not benefit Ghana and so people should vote "No".</p>
      <p>The IDEG is one of the institutions that believe that amending Article 55(3) will enhance Ghana's democracy.</p>
      <p>In his lecture, titled: "The national referendum on Article 55(3) of the Constitution — Is it important?", Dr Akwetey said a “Yes” vote would deepen Ghana's democracy.</p>
      <p>He said amending Article 55 (3) would go a long way to break the duopoly of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC), while allowing smaller parties to have a say in Ghana's development agenda.</p>
      <p>With a "Yes" vote, Dr Akwetey said, political parties which did not win national elections would have the chance to contest district-level elections and, if they won, they would maintain control of some assemblies.</p>
      <p>“It will encourage more inclusiveness in the governance of the country,” he added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Parties’ concerns</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the lecture, two political parties — the Convention People's Party (CPP) and the Liberal Party of Ghana (LPG) — expressed their support for a “Yes” vote.</p>
      <p>The Chairperson of the CPP, Hajia Hamdatu Ibrahim, said amending Article 55(3) would set the tone for a whole new transformation in Ghana's democracy.</p>
      <p>For his part, the acting Chairman of the LPG, Mr John Ameka, called for a “Yes” vote in the referendum.</p>
