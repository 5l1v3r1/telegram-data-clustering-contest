      <p>Lagos lawmakers probing former governor of the state, Akinwunmi Ambode, over the purchase of 820 buses as part of the Bus Reform Project during his administration on Wednesday said the suit he filed against them was incompetent.</p>
      <p>Represented by Mr Lawal Pedro (SAN), the lawmakers told an Ikeja High Court that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear the suit, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>They are also opposing the injunction Ambode wants to restrain them from probing him.</p>
      <p>Pedro said, “We have filed a notice of preliminary objection, highlighting the incompetence of this suit.</p>
      <p>“We are as well challenging the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit.</p>
      <p>“We also filed a counter-affidavit and a written address for the claimant’s motion for an interlocutory injunction.”</p>
      <p>Ambode seeks an injunction restraining the lawmakers from compelling him to appear before them pursuant to a resolution passed by House of Assembly on August 27 as well as any other resolution passed in respect of the probe.</p>
      <p>The former governor seeks a second injunction restraining the respondents from representing or continuing to represent to the public that he procured 820 buses in breach of budgetary approval.</p>
      <p>The claimant wants a court declaration that the powers of the National Assembly under Sections 103, 128 and 129 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, does not include the power to indict him as contemplated by Sections 66(1)(h), 137(1)i and 182(1) i of the constitution.</p>
      <p>Ambode also seeks a court declaration that the provisions of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 of the Appropriation Law of Lagos State, 2018, requiring the approval of the House of Assembly before certain expenditure of money are incurred by the executive arm of the state government is not in accordance with constitutional provisions.</p>
