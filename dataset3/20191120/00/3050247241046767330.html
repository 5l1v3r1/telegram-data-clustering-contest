      <h1>Online Gaming Platform Lets Gamers Collect BTC In First-Person Shooter Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:38:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:38</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>Donnerlab, an online gaming platform that builds lightning games and applications, lets gamers hunt for Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) and pick-up “Satoshi cubes.”</p>
      <h3>Shoot other players and collect satoshis</h3>
      <p>In a tweet on Nov. 19, Donnerlab <a href="https://twitter.com/donnerlab1/status/1196856002118852611">announced</a> the launch of its latest project, titled Bitcoin Bounty Hunt, a fully lightning-native multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) game. The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network">Lightning network</a> is a payment protocol that allows for fast, micropayments between two so-called nodes — in this case, gamers.</p>
      <p>Donnerlabs was <a href="https://bitcoinundco.com/de/konstantin-nick/">founded</a> by twenty-five-year-old Konstantin Nick after the 2018 <a href="https://lightninghackday.fulmo.org/">Lightning Hackday</a> in Munich, Germany, as a means to introduce the world’s largest cryptocurrency to more people. </p>
      <p>The FPS game features an integrated neutrino wallet, where gamers can store coins in a noncustodial fashion, an ad space for Hodl-auctions, and of course the ability to kill off other players in order to collect bounties. </p>
      <h3>Bitcoin adoption through games</h3>
      <p>In October, Bitcoin-enabled games startup Satoshis Games <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fortnite-meets-bitcoin-lightning-network-in-new-lightnite-video-game">announced</a> the development of a Fortnite-like game with built-in Lightning Network microtransactions, titled Lightnite, where interactions between players trigger a monetary reward or penalty for the user. Satoshis Games said at the time:</p>
      <blockquote>“In simple words, players earn Bitcoin by shooting other players and lose Bitcoin when they get shot.”</blockquote>
      <p>The game reportedly updates in real-time when the player damages another player, gets damaged or picks up an item with BTC value and allows gamers to instantly withdraw their balance via Lightning Network when they wish to do so.</p>
      <h3>“Lightning network will drive Bitcoin to $250,000”</h3>
      <p>In November, the pro-cryptocurrency venture capitalist Tim Draper <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/lightning-network-will-drive-bitcoin-to-250-000-by-2023-tim-draper">said</a> that innovations such as the Lightning network would be key in propelling the Bitcoin price higher. Draper believes that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2022 or 2023, in part due to “Bitcoin payment processors”, which “are really going to open the floodgates.” He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s because of Lightning Network and OpenNode and maybe others that are allowing us to spend Bitcoin very freely and quickly, so that it’s not just a store of value but it can be used for micropayments; it can be used for retail, it can be used all over.”</blockquote>
