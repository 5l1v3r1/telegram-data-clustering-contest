      <p>A little more than a month after its grand opening celebration, the sparkling new St. Regis Venice experienced the city’s worst flooding in half a century. Despite rising waters that infiltrated the ground floor, the latest European crown jewel in the St. Regis portfolio remained open and was soon restored to near-full functionality with most of its facilities, including the restaurant and bars, open and welcoming guests and visitors.Located just a short walk from Piazza San Marco with the longest water-frontage in the city, the property spans five Venetian palaces, the oldest of which dates back to the 17th century.</p>
      <p>More than a century ago, when well-heeled travelers ventured to Venice as part of their Grand Tours of Europe, they would stay at the former Grand Hotel Britannia, opened in 1895. There, they could sit in the garden overlooking the bustling Grand Canal with views of Venetian landmarks, such as the Santa Maria della Salute Basilica and the Punta della Dogana Museum. (More recently, the hotel was known as the Hotel Europa &amp; Regina, which operated under the Westin banner.)</p>

      <p>Today that historic garden, which had been converted into an interior banquet space, has been restored, much to the delight of guests who can lounge or sip a cocktail under the trees and watch Venetian life flow by on the city’s main thoroughfare. “The aim to replicate a curated Italian garden experience was something very strategic,” says Antonello de' Medici, the hotel’s general manager. “You can really feel in a different mood when you are surrounded by flowers in Venice. This is something very special, it’s a different gift to the guest that not everyone else has to offer.”</p>
      <p>The hotel features 129 guest rooms and 40 suites, 11 of which have private terraces, another rarity in Venice. These private outdoor spaces allow you to take in the spectacular views over breakfast, sunset drinks, or a midnight supper under the stars, in the style of socialite Caroline Astor, mother of John Jacob Astor IV, who founded St. Regis in New York in 1904.</p>
      <p>Historic traditions, such as nightly Champagne sabering rituals, have been preserved across the brand’s properties worldwide. Each St. Regis also offers a local interpretation of the Bloody Mary cocktail first served at the New York flagship in 1934.</p>

      <p>The hotel’s butler service is another distinguishing factor that has been updated for the modern age. “That is something that is exceptional in the world, because this is not just a service it’s a philosophy of life,” de' Medici explains, adding that the butler philosophy infuses every department. “Everyone should be anticipatory, be polite, and also be very proactive and give a sense of home. The philosophy is to replicate the House of Astor in Venice.”</p>
      <p> “It makes it so special that we have pulled through the traditions that started at the original property at 55th Street and Fifth Avenue,” says Lisa Holladay, global brand leader and vice president of St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton. “And then, we ask our GMs and our concierges to bring the destination to life in really special ways that would be hard to discover on your own or with such exclusive access.”</p>
      <p>In Venice, for example, they can arrange for a private after-dark tour of the famed St. Mark’s Basilica. Not only can you skip the daytime crowds, you will have the remarkable experience of quietly sitting in the Byzantine architectural jewel when the golden mosaic ceilings are illuminated to show off their full glory.</p>

      <p>The hotel’s walk-in entrance is tucked into a quiet courtyard near the city’s bustling premier shopping street, Calle XXII Marzo. Inside, the London-based interior design studio Sagrada sought to blend a mid-century-modern sense of glamour with historical references to local culture, conveying St. Regis’ contemporary international spirit infused with Venetian touches.</p>
      <p>Public spaces pay homage to the great 20th-century Venetian artist and architect Carlo Scarpa. Traditional Venetian terrazzo flooring is accented with a blue line, adding a modern flourish in the colorful library. Throughout the hotel, tailored fabrics and custom, handcrafted furnishings suggest the curves of gondolas, the patterns of the Doge’s Palace, the pavements of St. George’s churchyard, and the flowing waters of the canals.</p>
      <p>The dreamy color scheme takes inspiration from paintings of Venice by Claude Monet, who stayed at the Grand Hotel Britannia in 1908 and painted the scenes he regarded in the changing light throughout the day.</p>

      <p>Today, contemporary artworks evoking Venetian references serve as focal points throughout the public and private spaces. The hotel will host international artists to take residence and create unique pieces inspired by the property and its surroundings.</p>
      <p>The hotel’s first resident artist, Parisian Olivier Masmonteil, was commissioned to create original artworks for the Monet Suites and the Grand Salone, which features four of his paintings portraying contemporary interpretations of Tintoretto masterpieces. The colorful canvases interact with Massimiliano Pelletti’s heads sculpture, <i>Erosions</i>, and The <i>Tower </i>by Tony Cragg.</p>

      <p>A partnership with Murano’s Glasstress, the creative project of Berengo Studios, puts a modern twist on the region’s traditional glassmaking craft. Founded by Adriano Berengo in 2014, the initiative collaborates with international artists to create innovative works in glass, marrying Muranese glass-making traditions with contemporary art. One striking example is <i>Reclining Nocturne 3 </i>by Karen La Monte displayed in the hotel’s Long Gallery. The piece depicts a reclining female form in a blue-gray draped grown. In the adjacent Arts Bar, glass works by Erwin Wurm and Tony Cragg are on display.</p>
      <p>These contemporary artworks made using ancient Muranese techniques embody the hotel’s aspiration of creating a unique 21st-century travel experience while paying tribute to the city’s rich cultural history. “It was a challenge to create something global into a local atmosphere,” says de' Medici. “We need to tell the story that this is still Venice—not necessarily that you are in a formal palazzo that’s a bit opulent and rich, but you are in a different type of luxury environment with contemporary art.”</p>
