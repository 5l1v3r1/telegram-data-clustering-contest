      <h1>ESPN Analysts Give Brutally Honest Assessment Of Oklahoma’s Playoff Chances</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:26:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>After rallying to beat undefeated Baylor on Saturday, Oklahoma fans were likely hoping for a nice bump in the new College Football Playoff Rankings.</p>
      <p>Their hopes were dashed when <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">the rankings were unmasked</a> on ESPN moments ago and the Sooners came in at No. 9. Oklahoma gained just one spot from last weekend’s win.</p>
      <p>The committee has made it clear. As of now, Oklahoma is pretty buried, and they are probably not going to get in at 12-1 without chaos, even if they win out and win the Big 12.</p>
      <p>On the playoff rankings release show, ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit and Rece Davis both offered honest analysis on OU’s playoff hopes. According to Davis, Sooner fans should be rooting for Arizona and Arizona State this weekend.</p>

      <p>Looking at the rankings, Oklahoma needs to win out and have Georgia, Oregon, Utah and Penn State to all pick up a second loss.</p>
      <p>Even if that happens, the Sooners could be 12-1 and the Big 12 champs and still get snubbed in favor of 11-1 Alabama, which is ranked fifth right now. The Crimson Tide lost star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for the season on Saturday but did not drop in the rankings.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma will close out the regular season with TCU and Oklahoma State before a likely trip to the Big 12 title game.</p>
