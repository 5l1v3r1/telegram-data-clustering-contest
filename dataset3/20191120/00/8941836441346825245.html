      <p>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) - A Montana jury has convicted a man of killing a disabled veteran, burying his body in the dirt floor of a barn near Great Falls, selling his pickup truck and stealing his disability benefits for several months.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Brandon Lee Craft</a> was found guilty of deliberate homicide, tampering with evidence and deceptive practices in the February 2016 death of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Adam Petzack</a>, who was shot in the back of the head.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Petzack</a>’s mother said she was relieved with Tuesday’s verdict, which followed a five-day trial.</p>
      <p>“I took a deep breath,” Lori Petzack told the Great Falls Tribune. “I got my closure. I can now finally mourn and grieve my child and then celebrate his life and try and build a life for myself now that the majority of hell is done and over and gone.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutors presented evidence that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Craft</a> confessed in August 2016 to shooting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Adam Petzack</a> seven months earlier and drew a map to guide investigators to his body.</p>

      <p>Authorities say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Craft</a> wrote letters to his grandmother and his father-in-law acknowledging he killed the 28-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Petzack</a>. The letters said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Craft</a>’s wife had nothing to do with it, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Craft</a> testified that his now ex-wife, Katelyn Zdeb, was responsible for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Petzack</a>’s death. The couple divorced in 2017.</p>
      <p>During closing statements, Assistant Cascade County Attorney Kory Larsen said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Craft</a>’s claim that Zdeb killed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Petzack</a> didn’t make sense.</p>
      <p>Zdeb earlier pleaded guilty to stealing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Petzack</a>’s money and his pickup truck and agreed to testify against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Craft</a> as part of her plea agreement.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Petzack</a> was receiving disability payments because of a traumatic brain injury he suffered in Iraq and post-traumatic stress disorder, court records said.</p>
        <p>Lori Petzack, who is from New York, said she will return to Montana for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brandon-lee-craft/">Craft</a>’s sentencing. A sentencing date has not been set.</p>
        <p>“There is no forgiveness ever from me, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Adam</a>’s sister, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Adam</a>’s brother, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-petzack/">Adam</a>’s entire New York and Montana families. Ever,” she said. “This is unforgivable.”</p>
