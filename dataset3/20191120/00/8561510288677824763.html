      <h1>Penn State’s SETI Center Could Legitimize Alien Research</h1>

      <h3>Money, Please</h3>
      <p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is stuck in something of a catch-22.</p>
      <p>Researchers often have trouble funding their SETI efforts because the lack of discovered aliens <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientists-terrified-seti-research">makes the hunt seem pointless</a>. But we need more scientists looking for aliens to improve our chances of finding them.</p>
      <p>Now, a new <i>Scientific American</i> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/space-alien-research-could-get-its-first-grad-program/">story</a> details how an in-development center at Pennsylvania State University could break researchers out of that pattern — potentially signaling a shift in alien hunting from fringe science to legitimate academic pursuit.</p>
      <h3>SETI Support</h3>
      <p>Penn State astrophysics professor Jason Wright is currently spearheading the effort to create the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center (PSETI Center).</p>
      <p>The goal is for the academic center to become a hub of SETI research, <a href="http://pseti.psu.edu/">providing</a> “reliable funding for SETI for the long term” and legitimizing the search for aliens in a way that might actually speed up their discovery.</p>
      <p>“[Academia] formalizes disciplines and creates a canon of work that gets cited and a common body of knowledge to build upon,” Wright told <i>Scientific American</i>. “And that’s what SETI has been missing.”</p>
      <h3>Get Centered</h3>
      <p>Donors have already pledged roughly $3.5 million to the PSETI Center’s endowment, but as it stands, the center doesn’t actually exist — it’s still awaiting final approval from university officials.</p>
      <p>However, Douglas Cavener, dean of Penn State’s Eberly College of Science, is optimistic that the PSETI Center will get the go-ahead from the higher-ups.</p>
      <p>“The president [of Penn State] is already on our advisory board even though we don’t have a center,” he told <i>SA</i>.</p>
