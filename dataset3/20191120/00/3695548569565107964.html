      <h1>McLaren's Sainz: Brazilian GP was definitely best race of my career</h1>

        <b>McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr has no doubt his charge from the back of the Brazilian Grand Prix grid to a maiden Formula 1 podium was the best of his career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>An engine problem prevented Sainz from setting a time in qualifying, but he bounced back from that and finished fourth - before gaining a further spot when world champion Lewis Hamilton was given a penalty for clashing with Red Bull's Alex Albon.</p>
      <p>Sainz said he had been in "full attack mode" throughout the Brazilian GP, despite committing early on to a one-stop strategy that he knew would leave him exposed at the end.</p>
      <p>Asked by Autosport about how he rated his race, Sainz said: "My best. Definitely, because it was a normal race.</p>
      <p>"It was dry, people were between one and two stops and we committed to a one-stop.</p>
      <p>"I had to make moves on the first few laps and I did them. There was a move on [Sergio] Perez especially that was really, really good and from then on the tyre management kicked in.</p>
      <p>"I managed to extend on the soft and then the management on the medium. I started passing [Lance] Stroll, passing Lando [Norris] and other people, and all of a sudden I found myself in P8.</p>
      <p>"Then, the decision came to either pit or not and we decided not to. For once we took a bit of a gamble and this time it paid off.</p>
      <p>"The two SC restarts were probably the most difficult restarts of my life."</p>

      <p>Sainz added he had no explanation for how he was able to hold on to his place at the end of the race, with his tyres well past their best.</p>
      <p>"I had literally no grip," he said. "I was wheel-spinning in fourth and fifth gear at the start because we were so slow, so I couldn't put any energy on the tyres.</p>
      <p>"I got to Turn 1, locked up, just no grip, but somehow I managed to pick up the right line.</p>
      <p>"And from then onwards it was just defend, defend, defend as much as I could and we managed to finish."</p>
