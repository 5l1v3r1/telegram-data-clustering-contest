      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:15:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/ryan-lakich/" target="_blank">Ryan Lakich</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Buy the vigilant <a href="https://zdcs.link/e6eR1">SimpliSafe 9-piece wireless home security system at it's lowest price ever of $265.05</a> at Amazon. You likely won't get a better offer on Black Friday, and it's not the only sale you'll find at Amazon on other home security accessories. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The holidays are already stressful. After all your time and money spent on gifts, the last thing you should worry about is someone snatching them right off your doorstep. </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-home-security-cameras/">good home security system</a> is the best path to holiday peace of mind, and a better option than hoping your dog will scare thieves away. </p>
      <p>Amazon will help you stay one step ahead of aspiring Grinches with some early Black Friday offers on <a href="https://zdcs.link/e6eR1">SimpliSafe home security</a> and other popular brands like <a href="https://zdcs.link/0gYlr">Arlo</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/EAoPy">Ring</a>. While we expect other deals once <a href="https://blackfriday.com/ads/black-friday/amazon">Black Friday arrives</a>, it's never a bad idea to get a head start ahead of the rush. </p>
      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/e6eR1">SimpliSafe 9-piece wireless home security system with HD camera</a> — Save 31%</h3>
      <p>The best early Black Friday deal of the bunch is a $116.90 discount on a 9-piece SimpliSafe home security system that's the biggest we've ever seen on this model. It only requires a quick installation with no tools necessary and comes with a base station, key pad, four entry sensors, two motion sensors, and HD SimpliCam. With SimpliSafe, you can see everything that goes on at home from your phone, tablet, and any other device. And with all of the sensors and cameras in this kit, you get total protection all around your home. </p>

      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/0gYlr">Arlo Pro 2 wireless home security system with siren</a> — Save 35%</h3>
      <p>This system is one we ranked as one of the best overall home security systems due to its ability to continuously record on 1080p cameras whether indoors or outside. The only knock we had against the Arlo Pro 2 was the high cost, but a $169 discount on the 2-camera system mitigates that concern. On top of advanced motion detection and weather-resistant cameras, you get 2-way audio through your smartphone to give instructions for deliveries or scare away would-be Wet Bandits.</p>
