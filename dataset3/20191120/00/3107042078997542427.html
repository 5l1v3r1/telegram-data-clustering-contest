      <p>It doesn't look like Office 365 will be up for all 365 days of this particular year.</p>
      <p>The cloud version of Microsoft Office is offline for many users in what seems like a worldwide issue.</p>
      <p>At 2.13pm NZT, Microsoft posted a bulletin saying, "We've identified a problem that may be preventing customers from accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center and multiple services. We're working to restore access to the admin center, and we'll provide more information when we've isolated the root cause."</p>
      <p>Administrative functions are inaccessible for many users in the US, Australia, NZ and elsewhere and functions including Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, Skype, Yammer and Outlook 365 are offline.</p>
