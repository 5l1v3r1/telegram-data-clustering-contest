      <p>The West African Examination Council (WAEC) has withheld the entire results of 753 candidates out of 102,278 candidates who sat for the 2019 private West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).</p>
      <p>A statement signed by the Head of Public Affairs, Agnes Teye-Cudjoe on Tuesday, alleged the candidates were involved in various examination malpractices.</p>
      <p>“The withheld results will be released or cancelled as soon as the Council concludes its investigations,” the press statement read.</p>
      <p>However, this years’ examination malpractice is a major improvement on that of 2018.</p>
      <p>In 2018, WAEC withheld the entire results of 2,160 private candidates out of the 133,986 candidates who took part in the WASSCE as compared to this years’ 753 candidates.</p>
      <p>The Council further cautioned citizens to beware of fraudsters who will use dubious means to dupe them of their money.</p>
      <p>It further assured stakeholders that the result database is secured and any forged results will easily be detected through verification.</p>
      <p>“Institutions and organisations are therefore advised to confirm or verify results presented to them directly from the Council,” she said.</p>
