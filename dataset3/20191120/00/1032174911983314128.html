      <p>In a Facebook post in September, Cali-Mex fast-food chain Taco Bell announced it would <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/article/taco-bell-announces-melbourne-locations">open its first Victorian stores</a> in Hawthorn and South Yarra by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Today, real estate agents Fitzroys announced the location of one of those stores: Taco Bell has leased the 320-square-metre space formerly occupied by Chinese restaurant Chinacy at 352 Chapel Street, South Yarra.</p>
      <p>Taco Bell tried to enter the Australian market in the 1980s and ’90s, but closed. This newest attempt to break into the market launched in Queensland in late 2017, and the company has been slowly rolling out stores since then.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/hospitality/taco-bell-australia-stores/">As reported by Smart Company</a>, the roll-out around Australia is being led by two franchising businesses: Collins Foods Limited and Restaurant Brands. Both have sub-franchising agreements with Taco Bell.</p>
