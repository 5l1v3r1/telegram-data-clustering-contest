        <b>Chelsea's appeal hearing for a FIFA sanction banning them from signing new players until February 2020 took place on Wednesday. The hearing's outcome will not be known well into December, a few days before the winter market begins.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea will have to wait until the verdict on their appeal is decided, <b>without knowing whether or not they will be able to make any signings</b> in the winter transfer market. FIFA found the London club guilty of <b>150 offences in the contracts of 71 under-age players.</b></p>

      <p>Chelsea fought from day one to avoid the sanction, as did <b>Real Madrid or Barcelona</b>, but ended up having to abide by it, like Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>The 'Blues' could not sign anyone in summer, and now have a remnant of more than <b>170 million to invest in signings</b>. A blessing in desguise? If the transfer ban is indeed lifted, Chelsea would come into the winter transfer market with that amount to spend.Â </p>
