      <p>The Lands and Natural Resources Ministry has received preliminary findings into a mining accident that led to the death of two people at Yenyeya and Pabortaaba mining group’s site in the Upper East Region.</p>
      <p>The two, Jonathan Tengbil and Solomon Toshongba were reportedly hit by some large boulders as they watered a working area yesterday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Citi News, a Deputy Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Benito Owusu-Bio, said the Inspectorate Division of the Minerals Commission has advised the mining firm to carry out a structural integrity audit on the affected shaft.</p>
      <p>“In situations like this, what the Inspectorate division does is to ask the mining companies to stop work in that particular shaft to know how deep it is and ensure that it works need to be done to strengthen the place and to make all the sealing and the linings of the shaft hole that is done.”</p>
      <p>The company says it has launched an investigation into the matter to ensure safety on the mine.</p>
      <p>In the past, frequent deaths of miners in pits in the area have been recorded.</p>
      <p>Seventeen illegal miners were trapped and killed between 2017 and 2019 in the area as they attempted using illegal pits to steal gold ore.</p>
      <p>Recommendations made by the Inspectorate Division of the Minerals Commission have been to seal all illegal pits following casualties.</p>
