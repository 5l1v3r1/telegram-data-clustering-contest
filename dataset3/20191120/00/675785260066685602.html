      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:01:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Rachel Pugh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A woman has revealed a cheap 'hack' to helps drivers quickly melt the ice on their car windscreens.</p>
      <p>The driver shared her secret on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>, telling friends to fill up an old bottle of carpet stain remover with warm water to wash away the ice.</p>
      <p>Angela Hickling uploaded a video showing her using the container, which comes with a brush, to clear her windscreen, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/money-saving/genius-hack-melts-windscreen-ice-17281072">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The product only costs £2.80 and can be used multiple times, saving drivers from getting cold hands in the morning.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "I'm a genius. Get yourself one of these bottles, fill it with warm water and you're sorted.</p>

      <p>"No cold hands scraping anymore and it cleans your window screen too, the brush bit is ideal. Off to work now, have a great day people."</p>
      <p>The post quickly went viral, with over 3,400 people sharing it on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>"You are a genius," responded one Facebook user.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Nope, I would have never thought that! Honestly gonna buy one just for that reason."</p>

      <p>"That's amazing. I need some more of that so I will save the bottle after lol," wrote somebody else.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Angela revealed how she had come up with the savvy idea.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was just looking through my boyfriend's cupboard to find some sort of gadget as I really didn't want my fingers freezing off, and saw the bottle.</p>
      <p>"I had a light bulb moment.. filled it with warm water and it worked perfectly. I was so happy."</p>

      <p>She added: "As you can see on the video it worked instantly, I didn't even need all the water in the bottle."</p>
      <p>To replicate the hack, you'll just need to buy yourself a bottle of Dr Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover.</p>
      <p>The cheapest one we can find is currently <a href="https://fave.co/343o4I5">£2.80 from Wilko</a> - though once you've bought it you'll be able to use it time and time again.</p>
      <p>Make sure you've emptied it and thoroughly rinsed it before using it on your car.</p>
      <p>Then you'll just need to fill it with warm water and watch the ice melt away. Don't use boiling water as it might crack your car windscreen.</p>
