      <h1>Foldable Samsung W20 5G arrives in China with Snapdragon 855+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=32" target="_blank">Yordan</a></address>
      <p>Samsung has been doing its W series clamshells in China since 2013, with the latest editions having two touch screens as well as a T9 keyboard. Today Samsung took that to another level with the W20 5G foldable phone in China. Essentially the China Telecom version of the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_fold_5g-9851.php">Galaxy Fold 5G</a>, the W20 comes in its own unique paint job and a new chipset.</p>
      <p>The phone is exclusive to China Telecom and has a Snapdragon 855+ chipset, which is a slight upgrade over the 855 in the original version of the foldable device.</p>

      <p>The specs of the phone are well known - 7.3” Dynamic AMOLED panel on the inside and a secondary 4.6” Super AMOLED screen on the cover.</p>
      <p>Samsung is shipping the Galaxy W20 5G with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage, while the battery is 4,235 mAh. It is slightly less than the 4,380 mAh capacity in the non-5G variant, presumably since the antennas take more space.</p>

      <p>The color option is only one - White - and is exclusive for China Telecom. The W20 5G will be available next month, but the actual date and pricing will be announced later. It should be a bit more expensive than the basic <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_fold-9523.php">Galaxy Fold</a> that sells for CNY15,999, which translates to $2,270.</p>
