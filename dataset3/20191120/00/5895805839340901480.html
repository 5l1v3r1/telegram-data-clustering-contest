      <p>The number of older adults is increasing in America and throughout the world. From Baby Boomers entering their later years to advances in health care extending longevity of life, this segment of the population is rapidly growing. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dementia">Dementia</a> is one of the most common mental health conditions affecting this group. In recognition of Alzheimer’s Awareness Month, we wanted to focusare focusing this month’s blog on this important condition that impacts many Americans and their families.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory">Memory</a> Loss and Dementia</b>
      </p>
      <p>We all have moments when we forget someone’s name or cannot recall an item on our to-do list. Some slight decline in memory and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognition">cognition</a> is normal with aging. But all too often, more advanced memory loss is attributed to aging when in fact a true underlying mental health condition exists. One such mental health problem that can cause advanced memory loss is dementia. By definition, dementia refers to any decline in memory, behavior, and thinking abilities severe enough to affect daily functioning on a consistent basis.</p>
      <p>While many forms of dementia exist, Alzheimer’s dementia is by far the most common. In fact, Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60 to 80% of the dementia cases. The disease usually starts of off slow and subtle but progresses to be more serious over time. The disease is characterized by the development of abnormal protein deposits being formed in the brain.[1] While the pathologic findings are well recognized in this disease, its precise cause remains unknown, and thus treatments are limited. However, there are some known interventions that can help enhance quality of life not only for those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease but also for their caregivers.</p>
      <p>How is dementia treated? The first step naturally involves making the correct diagnosis, but unless friends and/or family recognize a problem exists, the opportunity to diagnose early (when treatments are most effective) is often lost. Many quick screening tests are now available that can be performed by any health professional, and memory-screening programs (including local National Memory Screening Day programs) exist. If dementia is suspected based on these screening tools, then further testing may be performed in order to guide treatment. Treatments range from medications to behavioral therapies. The goal of treatment interventions is to seek to enhance memory abilities, address mood disturbances, and improve behaviors and levels of functioning. If you suspect a loved one has a memory problem, don’t assume it’s a normal effect of getting older. Instead, have them formally screened so proper care can be provided.</p>

        <b>Family Issues with Alzheimer’s Disease</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having a loved one with dementia poses many challenges for friends and family members. The person you have come to know and love suddenly isn’t the same anymore. Bit by bit, they lose the capacity to remember and perform routine tasks, declining before your very eyes. For this reason, the process of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/bereavement">mourning</a> the person you love begins well before their eventual passing, and the emotional challenges for family members can be immense throughout this time. Especially for spouses and partners, having a loved one suffer from advancing dementia can trigger <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a> as well as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a>, requiring treatment for these individuals as well.</p>
      <p>While you can imagine the emotional pain for anyone with a family member who suffers from dementia, the struggles for primary caregivers are even more profound. In the US, more than 65 million adults perform some type of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/caregiving">caregiving</a> role, and about one quarter of these individuals care for someone with Alzheimer’s disease.[2] Given the demands of the caregiver role, some studies report that close to half of all caregivers experience depression. Self-reported surveys of caregivers show 15 percent reporting excessively high levels of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a>, with 21 percent also reporting physical strain.[3] Thus, making sure caregivers have adequate support (and treatment when needed) is essential to avoiding this secondary complication of dementia.</p>
      <p>Other challenges develop when a loved one has to make the tough decision of whether to place a family member suffering from dementia in a nursing home or other type of long-term care facility. No one wants to make such a decision, but circumstances may dictate otherwise. If promises were made in the past to never allow placement outside the home to happen, such a decision can be especially emotionally exhausting and ridden with <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/guilt">guilt</a>. Predicting the future is impossible when such promises are made, and often the time comes when it may be in a patient’s best interest to be in such a facility for their own safety and well-being. Maybe you as a caregiver have reached your limit and can no longer provide the care needed. Or perhaps the person’s level of dementia has progressed to the point at which the home environment can no longer protect them from harm.</p>
      <p>Different scenarios exist for each family, and no single “right” decision exists. In such situations, family members and caregivers need support, guidance, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/coaching">counseling</a> to help them make the best choices possible. In addition to support and guidance from the patient’s physicians and health-care providers, individual and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/marriage-and-family-therapy">family therapy</a> interventions are available for caregivers and families as well. Professional and community-based group therapies also exist. In some cases, individual treatment for depression or anxiety disorders may be needed when these interventions are inadequate. Dealing with dementia is certainly fraught with an array of challenges for caregivers, family members, and even close friends. Seeking support and assistance becomes very important when faced with these extremely difficult issues.</p>
