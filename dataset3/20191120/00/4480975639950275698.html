      <p>Given the US Senate’s latest bill on Hong Kong, coupled with the below-trend AU Westpac Leading Index, weighing on the AUD/JPY pair, the quote trades near 74.00 during Wednesday’s Asian session.</p>
      <p>The Bloomberg news that the United States (US) Senate unanimously passed a bill aimed at supporting protesters in Hong Kong seems to have recently fueled the market’s risk-off moves. The bill is sent to the House of Representatives for approval and if passed will warn China against a violent suppression of the demonstrations. This indicates further hardships for the US-China trade negotiators who are jostling over the phase one talks with the concerns over tariff rollback acting as the latest roadblock.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Australia’s Westpac Leading Index for October rose past downwardly revised -0.12% to -0.07%. However, the Westpac report published after the release says, “the Leading Index growth rate remains materially below trend and continues to point to weak economic momentum carrying well into 2020.”</p>
      <p>Also occupying the economic calendar were Japan’s trade numbers for October. The headlines Trade Balance weakened below ¥301 B forecast to ¥17.3 B while Imports recovered to -14.8% versus -16% expected but Exports slipped to -9.2% against -7.6% market consensus.</p>
      <p>With this, the US 10-year Treasury yields remain under pressure around 1.77% while the S&amp;P 500 Futures lose -0.13% to 3,112 by the press time.</p>
      <p>Considering the lack of major statistics/events on the economic calendar, traders will keep eyes on headlines concerning the US-China trade relations and Hong Kong for fresh impulse.</p>
      <h3>Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 74.30 acts as an immediate upside barrier ahead of early-month low near 74.60. On the contrary, 73.40/35, comprising the monthly bottom, could keep checking sellers.</p>
