      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Tennessee officials say they’re committing not to halt or limit coverage under a revised proposal to become the first state to receive funding in a lump sum for its Medicaid program, TennCare.</p>
      <p>The block grant plan heading for federal consideration Wednesday was amended to say the state “would not be permitted to use this authority to make reductions to its benefits package.”</p>
      <p>Though Republican Gov. Bill Lee assured that patients wouldn’t risk losing benefits or eligibility, the first draft elicited overwhelming concern about possible cuts to those areas.</p>
      <p>The submitted version also says possible state savings could be used to expand TennCare eligibility.</p>
