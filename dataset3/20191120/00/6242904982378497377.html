      <p>GFA President Kurt E.S. Okraku has urged the Black Meteors to forgo their loss against Ivory Coast and grab a ticket to the 2020 Olympic Games in the third place play-off.</p>
      <p>The Ghana U23 lost on penalties in the semi-finals of the U23 Africa Cup of Nations to Ivory Coast on Tuesday which blocked their chance of securing a place in next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors have another chance to book a place in the summer Olympics as they play South Africa in the third place play-off on Friday.</p>
      <p>A win will see Ghana booking their ticket to Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Following Tuesday's defeat, the GFA Boss was at the team's hotel after the game to inspire and encourage the players and technical staff that all is not lost.</p>
      <p>"This match is gone let’s focus on the next match on Friday and our next opponents. All hope is not lost." he said.</p>
      <p>"Our ambition is to qualify to the Olympics if we fight like we did in the second half (against Ivory Coast) we will make it to the Olympics."</p>
      <p>He implored the entire team to remain positive ahead of the third place play off.</p>
      <p>"Let’s be positive about Friday and get the conviction that we can do it."</p>
      <p>He also advised the team to let go all the challenges and focus on achieving their priority.</p>
      <p>"This team has gone through battles and people have lost hope. Once again We will give hope back to the entire nation on Friday by securing a ticket to Tokyo."</p>
