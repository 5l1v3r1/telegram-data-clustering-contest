      <p>Former Nigeria striker, Odion Ighalo, has passed a vote of confidence in Victor Osimhen, saying the Lille’s star is capable of leading Super Eagles attack.</p>
      <p>He said this few days after Eagles coach Gernot Rohr revealed that criticisms followed his choice of taking Osimhen to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>Osimhen helped Nigeria defeat Benin 2-1 victory last Wednesday, and grabbed a brace and two assists in Eagles 4-2 win against Lesotho on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ighalo, who retired from his international career in July after Eagles’ third-place finish at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt, warned Osimhen to be focused on his career.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Shenhua forward also warned the 20-year-old Eagles striker against pride, urging him to be ready to learn.</p>
      <p>“I always told him that he has everything it takes to lead this attack, but it all depends on him.</p>
      <p><i>“I told him he has to keep working hard, stay humble and always be ready to learn, and above all not to get carried away with success or hype but just to keep improving,” Ighalo told </i>ESPN<i>.</i></p>
