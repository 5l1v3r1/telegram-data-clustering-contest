      <h1>Apple starts construction of new $1 billion campus in Texas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/apple-computer-inc">AAPL</a>) said on Wednesday it had started construction of a new campus in Austin, Texas, beside its existing facility where it makes the new MacBook Pro laptops.</p>
      <p>Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is set to give a tour of the Texas factory to U.S. President Donald Trump later on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The company has come under fire from Trump because it makes most of its products in China. But Cook and Trump have developed a good relationship. In 2017, Trump said Cook had "promised me three big plants â€” big, big, big."</p>
      <p>The new $1 billion, 3-million-square-foot campus will initially house 5,000 employees, with the capacity to grow to 15,000, and is expected to open in 2022, Apple said.</p>
      <p>Austin is one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities, with a population of about 1 million, and is home to the University of Texas and other tech companies, including Dell Technologies Inc in nearby Round Rock, Texas.</p>
      <p>Apple currently employs about 7,000 employees in Austin.</p>
      <p>The company also continues its expansion in Boulder, Culver City, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego and Seattle, it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Apple said it is also preparing to ship the new Mac Pro desktop computers to customers, at a production facility just a short distance away from Austin, starting in December.</p>
      <p>The new Mac Pro desktop became a political flashpoint earlier this year when the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was moving production to China.</p>
