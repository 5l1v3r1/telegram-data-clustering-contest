      <p>This festive season, Emirates has announced special fares for some popular Europeans destinations on its network. Valid for bookings until November 25, 2019, this ongoing sale includes discounted economy and business class fares for passengers looking to travel between November 24, 2019 to September 30, 2020.</p>
      <p>Travellers booking their flights from India to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Manchester, and Vienna can avail discounts on economy class fares, while those travelling from India to Frankfurt, Milan, Prague, and Zurich can obtain these fares by booking tickets on business class.</p>
      <p>Emirates Skywards members can book their tickets using Cash+ Miles which allows them to pay partly by cash and partly using the skywards miles. In addition to this, skywards members can earn twice the miles by flying Emirates to or from Mexico City via Barcelona, starting December 9, 2019.</p>
      <p>At present, Emirates operates 170 weekly flights to and from nine cities in India including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata and Mumbai; and offers connectivity to over 150 global destinations. <a href="https://www.emirates.com/in/english/"><b>emirates.com</b></a></p>
