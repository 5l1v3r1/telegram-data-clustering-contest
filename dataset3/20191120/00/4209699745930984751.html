      <p>Nigeria’s Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami, on Wednesday said that the country had appealed a $200m payment imposed by a United Kingdom court in its contention with the controversial Process and Industrial Development LTD over a failed 2010 contract. </p>
      <p>The court ordered that the payment be made before it can give a stay of execution on the ruling by Justice Butcher that P&amp;ID could seize over $9bn worth of Nigeria’s assets pending its appeal in a higher court.</p>
      <p>“We have appealed against the payment,” Reuters quoted Malami as saying. </p>
      <p>Nigeria was given permission to appeal the seizure in September but was ordered to pay the $200m within 60 days. </p>
      <p>The time frame expires next week. </p>
      <p>In his statement however, Malami left out details of when the appeal was made and if any response had been received from the court.</p>
      <p>In its appeal, Nigeria would have to prove there was an error in the previous ruling. </p>
      <p>Malami said the nature of the appeal would necessitate the hiring of a new set of lawyers.</p>
      <p>“We may decide to bring on board new sets of lawyers to handle the new brief but we may decide that the old and new lawyers should work together,” he said. </p>
      <p>P&amp;ID is owned by two Irishmen, Michael Quinn and Brandon Cahill. </p>
      <p>A Bloomberg report detailed how Quinn conned the Nigerian Government in partnership with military officials and intended to use the gas processing contract as his big break. </p>
      <p>Quinn had previously sued the Nigerian Government for two similar contract breaches like the case gaining media attention.</p>
