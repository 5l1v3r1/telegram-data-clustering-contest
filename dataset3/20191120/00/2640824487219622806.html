      <p><b>the new <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/audi/">AUDI</a> e-tron sportback made its debut at the 2019 LA auto show, launched as the company’s second <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/electric-automobiles/">electric car</a>.</b> it uses largely identical hardware to the <a href="https://www.designboom.com/technology/audi-e-tron-interior-preview-electric-sound-07-05-2018/">e-tron SUV</a>, which was revealed last year, packing the same 95 kWh battery with a few new features and specs.</p>

      <p><b>slated for a 2020 europe release, the dynamic SUV coupé offers up to 277 miles of range and uses dual electric motors with an output of 265 kW and a combined peak of 355 horsepower.</b> a slightly less powerful version of the sportback with a smaller battery will also be available, starting at €71,350 (around $79,000).</p>

      <p><b>its roof extends flat over the muscular body, dropping down steeply to the rear and flowing into the steeply raked D-pillars.</b> the lower edge of the third side window rises towards the rear—a typical sportback feature.</p>

      <p><b>inside, the driver can activate functions using voice controls and amazon alexa is built in.</b> there is a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel, a 12.1-inch main touchscreen in the dashboard, and another 8.6-inch touchscreen below that for text input and climate controls.</p>

      <p><b>digital matrix LED headlights are a new feature, available for the first time in a mass-production vehicle.</b> their light is broken down into tiny pixels and can be controlled with exceptional precision. this makes safe lane-centring easier on narrow stretches of road and shows the position of the vehicle in the lane.</p>
