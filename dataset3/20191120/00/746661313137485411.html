      <p>Sweden’s prosecution authority says it had dropped its investigation into WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over a 2010 rape allegation, despite prosecutors finding the plaintiff’s claim “credible”.</p>

      <p>The rape investigation was launched after a woman who met Assange at a Stockholm conference in August 2010 accused the Australian of having unprotected sex with her while she was sleeping. She said she had repeatedly refused to have unprotected sex with him.</p>
      <p>Assange has always denied the allegation.</p>
      <p>Swedish deputy director of public prosecutions Eva-Marie Persson told reporters on Tuesday said that, in part due to how many years had passed since the incident, “the evidence has weakened in such a way that there is no longer reason to continue the investigation”.</p>
      <p>“My assessment is that all investigative measures that can be taken have been taken. But… the evidence is not strong enough to file an indictment,” deputy director of public prosecutions Eva-Marie Persson told reporters.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors had struggled for years to interrogate Assange in person, but an interview was carried out with the help of an Ecuadorian prosecutor at the embassy in 2016.</p>
      <p>Persson said she didn’t think another interview with Assange would add to the investigation in a meaningful way.</p>
      <p>But she stressed that “the plaintiff has given a credible and reliable account.”</p>
      <p>“I have… determined that it cannot be proven that a crime has been committed. But it would be totally wrong of me to say that it is the plaintiff’s fault,” Persson told AFP.</p>
