        <b>José Mourinho is the man of the day in the world of football. One of the most talked-about issues is the astronomical salary that Daniel Levy has given him at Tottenham, almost twice the salary that Mauricio Pochettino received.</b>
      </p>
      <p>From being unemployed to receiving an astronomical salary in a year. He is about the become the<b> 2nd highest-paid manager in the world</b> after Pep Guardiola. According to 'Daily Mail', this money doesn't just go to anyone.</p>
      <p>A total of 15 million pounds a year. With the current exchange rate, this would be the equivalent <b>to just more than 17.5 million euros</b>. His predecessor in the Tottenham hot seat earned just less than 10 million, according to the same source.</p>

      <p>Breaking down his wage, he earns 52,000 euros a day to manage spurs. A salary more than considerable and that surely helps him to digest the possible criticisms from Chelsea after breaking his word four years later. </p>
      <p>News of the Portuguese's appointment at Spurs has, therefore, cost the club quite a lot of money after sacking the Argentine and strongly backing Mourinho.</p>
