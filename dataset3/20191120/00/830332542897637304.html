      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Engineering crews will start drilling vertical holes at the end of Nov. in Reindahl Park to test the soil for its strength for the Imagination Center at Reindahl Park project, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>The holes will be 6-nches wide and 20-feet deep so engineering crews can determine the soil's consistency, strength and durability. The results will be used to help with planning the building's foundation, floor slab, pavement design and construction, according to the release.</p>
      <p>According to the release, the holes will be refilled once the work is done.</p>
      <p>CGC, Inc. has been hired to oversee the work and Badger State Drilling as the subcontractor for the drilling, which will take several days, according to the release.</p>
