      <h1>Boost housing benefit to ease homeless crisis, says charity in general election plea</h1>
      <h2>The call comes from Crisis, which wants welfare-dependent families to be able to afford rising rents</h2>

      <p>Fewer than one in 10 homes is affordable to small families on housing benefit across swathes of the country, a study warns today.</p>
      <p>Analysis by homelessness charity Crisis says a third of Britain is clobbered by having less than 10% of housing affordable for households relying on the welfare benefit.</p>
      <p>Urgent investment in housing benefit is needed so it covers rental costs and does not push families towards homelessness, the charity says.</p>
      <p>Crisis chief executive Jon Sparkes said: “Ending homelessness is truly possible but we have to tackle the root causes, not just treat the symptoms.</p>

      <p>“We need to see commitment from the next Government to sign up to our manifesto to end all forms of homelessness, which includes urgent investment in housing benefit.</p>
      <p>“The next Government cannot ignore the widespread public desire to change the system – it must do all it can to make sure everyone has a home they can afford.”</p>
      <p>Housing benefit was designed to help people on low incomes who are unable to meet the cost of private rent.</p>
      <p>Rates were previously set so people could afford the cheapest 30% of properties in their area - but a freeze on the benefit since 2016 has made properties less affordable, Crisis said.</p>
