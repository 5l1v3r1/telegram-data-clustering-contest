      <p>Epic Games announced that Season 11 of <i>Fortnite </i>would be extended by about two months in order to prepare material for the Christmas break and other events.That’s almost the length of an entire season! It’s a strange move by the game’s creator, especially since we’re only in the first season of Chapter 2 and one would expect a bit more . . . momentum?</p>
      <p>In any case, today’s v11.20 update has been datamined, and a bunch of very cool new skins have been unearthed. These include the first Christmas skins for this year’s holiday season, as well as some good demonic skins and some special forces style skins. We’ll start with . . .</p>
      <p>
        <b>Globe Shaker (Epic)~ Make it snow</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Globe Shaker (Epic)~ Make it snow<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is very clearly a Christmas skin, and I actually really like it. A snow globe for a head and a llama sweater? Count me in.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bundles (Rare) ~ Bundle up for the battle</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Bundles (Rare) ~ Bundle up for the battle<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I think Bundles qualifies as a Christmas skin–the Christmas version of Cuddle Team Leader, essentially. At the very least a decidedly wintry skin, whether you want to call it Christmas or not.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Autumn Queen (Rare) ~ Ruler of the forest</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a5382c886a0007eca2c5/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>The Autumn Queen (Rare) ~ Ruler of the forest<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is a terrific skin that isn’t really Christmas-themed what with it being the Autumn Queen. Epic is almost late to the party with this one, as Autumn quickly fades. Winter is coming, after all.</p>
      <p>Most of this leak’s skins are <i>not </i>Christmas-themed. I expect we see many more in the coming updates, and especially once we’re a bit closer to Christmas itself. The rest are really cool skins, though!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sorana (Legendary) ~ She's here to crash the party</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a5f0e0af7b0006b1db07/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Sorana (Legendary) ~ She's here to crash the party<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sorana is a Legendary special ops style skin with multiple styles which all seem to be leggings-related. Pretty cool skin but not my favorite of the batch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Big Chuggus (Epic) ~ Small chugguses need not apply</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a635ea103f000652e892/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Big Chuggus (Epic) ~ Small chugguses need not apply<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I suppose this guy comes from the Slurpy Swamp, continuing with the Slurp-Juice theme of this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dominion (Epic) ~ Set the world on fire</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a64fe0af7b0006b1db1c/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Dominion (Epic) ~ Set the world on fire<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I really like this Dominion skin. We’ve had devil skins but there’s something really cool about this one, with the shotgun shells and the fiery symbol. He’s kind of like an elfish version of Hellboy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kurohomura (Epic) ~ Born of fire and destined for greatness</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a6aaea103f000652e925/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Kurohomura (Epic) ~ Born of fire and destined for greatness<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>More of an Asian style devil skin, I also think this one is pretty cool.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sklaxis (Epic) ~ Sssss</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a6dae0af7b0006b1db24/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Sklaxis (Epic) ~ Sssss<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This Sklaxis is basically a snake ninja. That’s pretty neat. Reminds me of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/10/15/fortnite-chapter-2-the-tier-100-battle-pass-skin-comes-with-a-twist/#1d74b25d4346">this season’s Tier 100 skin a bit–Fusion.</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Terns (Epic) ~ The spirit of the forest</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a7302c886a0007eca337/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Terns (Epic) ~ The spirit of the forest<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>One of my favorite skins in this batch, Terns reminds me a lot of <i>Ori and the Blind Forest, </i>which I suppose is fitting since his tagline is “spirit of the forest.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brilliant Bomber (Rare) ~ Show your shine</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a774ea103f000652e947/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Brilliant Bomber (Rare) ~ Show your shine<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This new take on Bright Bomber is . . . a little ho-hum, to be honest. If it were a style variant that’d be one thing but she looks far too much like the original.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Depth Dealer (Rare) ~ Deep six the competition</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a7b9e0af7b0006b1db37/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Depth Dealer (Rare) ~ Deep six the competition<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Depth Dealer is an aquatic special forces style skin with cool aquamarine camo. Pretty cool if nothing terribly special.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hush (Rare) ~ Silence the opposition</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a7f3ea103f000652e968/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Hush (Rare) ~ Silence the opposition<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ninja assassin chick with a face mask and lots of midriff showing. Sounds good to me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stringray (Rare) ~ Beware the silent sting of doom</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a8282c886a0007eca34a/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Stringray (Rare) ~ Beware the silent sting of doom<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Special Forces ninja style skin with a very cool mesh mask. You’ll notice that on this skin as well as Sorana there’s a little skull icon on their uniform. It’s possible other skins in this batch have the same icon. I wonder what it stands for? It must have something to do with the–as of yet nonexistent–Season 11 storyline. Right?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Razor (Uncommon) ~ Reclaim your kingdom, one break at a time</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd5a8ab2c886a0007eca365/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Razor (Uncommon) ~ Reclaim your kingdom, one break at a time<cite>Credit: Epic</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Last but not least, Razor looks like a cross between a pilot and a German beer girl wearing what almost appears to be a dirndl. Her tagline–about reclaiming a kingdom “one break at a time” is very peculiar. I’m not sure what to think.</p>
      <p>In any case, that’s all the leaked skins from the v11.20 patch. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/20/fortnite-miraculously-brings-back-patch-notes-for-v1120/">You can read the patch notes right here.</a></p>
