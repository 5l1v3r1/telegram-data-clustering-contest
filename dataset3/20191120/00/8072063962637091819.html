      <p><b>(AP) —</b> Britain’s Prince Andrew said Wednesday he is stepping back from public duties with the Queen’s permission.</p>
      <p>Andrew said it has become clear to him in recent days that his association with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has become a “major distraction” to the royal family’s work.</p>
      <p>He said he regrets his association with the former US businessman and that he “deeply sympathises” with his victims.</p>
      <p>The prince said his mother Queen Elizabeth II had given him permission to step back from royal duties.</p>
      <p>Andrew has been heavily criticized for his performance in a TV interview Saturday in which he failed to express concern for Epstein’s victims.</p>
      <p>He seemed to show no remorse for his close association with a convicted sex offender who had abused many underage girls.</p>
      <p>Some charities that he has worked with as a patron have said they were reviewing their association with the prince because of his actions.</p>
      <p>Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, robbing his alleged victims of a chance for their day in court. His death on August 10 in a New York prison has been ruled a suicide by the city’s medical examiner.</p>
      <p>Andrew said Epstein’s suicide left many unanswered questions.</p>
