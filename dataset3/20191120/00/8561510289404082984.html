      <h1>Astronomers Just Found the Wreckage Cloud From a 1987 Supernova</h1>

      <h3>Stargazing</h3>
      <p>Scientists finally found the cosmic wreckage of a famous supernova that detonated 32 years ago.</p>
      <p>The remains — from a neutron star that collapsed on itself after exploding — was hidden away in a thick cloud of space dust that Cardiff University astronomers only just pierced with the extremely sensitive ALMA telescope in Chile, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab4b46">according to research</a> published Tuesday in <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>. Now that it’s been spotted, scientists can better understand the process of how <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/brutal-supernova-recorded-history">stars live and die</a>.</p>
      <h3>Missing Piece</h3>
      <p>This particular supernova was closer to Earth than any other in recent centuries — the months-long explosion helped scientists understand the life cycle of stars. Now that astronomers found the aftermath, they can put more of the pieces together.</p>
      <p>“Our new findings will now enable astronomers to better understand how massive stars end their lives, leaving behind these extremely dense neutron stars,” <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-11-scientists-evidence-neutron-star.html">said study author</a> and Cardiff astronomer Mikako Matsuura.</p>
