      <p>Wellington.Scoop<br/>A sewage leak at the corner of Willis Street and Dixon Street is affecting the inner Wellington Harbour, with people being warned to stay out of the water, specifically in the Whairepo Lagoon.</p>
      <p>Wellington Water reports:</p>
      <p>We have narrowed down the location of the leake to a 10m long concrete chamber at the North/Western corner of the intersection and will continue carrying out investigations to understand the extent of the issue. From this investigation we will form a construction plan to repair the concrete chamber.</p>
      <p>We expect these works to continue throughout the day from 9am-4pm for at least the next week. We will continue with the current stop/go traffic management, however any changes to the works area may alter the traffic flow.</p>
      <p>The leak is affecting the inner Wellington Harbour, so we continue to warn people to stay out of the water specifically in the Whairepo Lagoon.</p>
      <p>We are carrying out testing in the Harbour and will advise of the results.</p>
