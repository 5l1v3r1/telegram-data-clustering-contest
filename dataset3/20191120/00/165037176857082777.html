        <b>Belgium were in clinical form against Cyprus and, according to Roberto Martinez, look worthy winners of Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Roberto Martinez </b>believes <b>Belgium</b> deserve to win<b> Euro 2020</b> but acknowledges that will count for little if they do not perform at the finals.</p>
      <p>Belgium completed their qualification campaign on Tuesday, thrashing <b>Cyprus 6-1</b> to end with <b>10 wins from 10 </b>in Group I, scoring 40 goals in the process.</p>
      <p>Martinez has already seen enough to suggest Belgium are worthy of a maiden major<b> international title</b>, yet he knows there is plenty of work to do.</p>
      <p>"Whether <b>we can win the European Championship</b>, that is something that we have in our hands," head coach Martinez said. "We need to get even better and then we see if we can play another great tournament.</p>
      <p>"We have <b>set the standard at the World Cup</b> [finishing third] and we are continuing to develop into a team with a great deal of togetherness. And the fans are also important.</p>

      <p>"We now have seven months to become as good as possible. This team deserves to win the European Championship but, in football, <b>it's not that simple</b>."</p>
      <p>Reflecting on qualifying, he added: "I think <b>everyone just worked really well</b> this year. The players know what to do and they do it with an incredible focus.</p>
      <p>"Scoring six times and then playing again in this way is <b>very good</b>."</p>
      <p>Kevin <b>De Bruyne</b>, who scored twice in a playmaking masterclass against Cyprus, added: "It's always beautiful. Nobody has given it to us.</p>
      <p>"Once you start the qualification, you have to go <b>match by match</b> and we did. It's very nice to finally get there [with 10 wins]."</p>
