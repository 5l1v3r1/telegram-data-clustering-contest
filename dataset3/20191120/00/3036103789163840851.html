      <h1>Beware fake Windows update that installs ransomware</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>A fake Windows update email is being used to infect devices with ransomware.</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity company <b><a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/fake-windows-update-spam-leads-to-cyborg-ransomware-and-its-builder/">Trustwave</a></b> spotted an email that claims to be from Microsoft and warns the recipient to update their operating system.</p>
      <p>The email contains the subject line “Install Latest Microsoft Windows Update now!” or “Critical Microsoft Windows Update!”, and a message stating “Please install the latest critical update from Microsoft attached to this email”.</p>
      <p>The attached “update” file has a .jpeg extension, but it is actually an executable .NET downloader.</p>
      <p>Once this file is opened, additional payloads are pulled from a GitHub account named “misterbtc2020” and an executable called “bitcoingenerator.exe” encrypts the victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible.</p>
      <p>A text file with the name “Cyborg_DECRYPT.txt” is left on the user’s desktop, demanding that $500 in bitcoin be transferred to a specified cryptocurrency wallet to decrypt their data.</p>
      <h3>Remain alert</h3>
      <p>Trustwave said the associated GitHub account has since been removed, but Windows users should remain wary of any further attempts to install ransomware through false update alerts.</p>
      <p>The company added that any malicious actor with access to the Cyborg ransomware builder can attach this malware to an email.</p>
      <p>It recommended that users who receive similar emails not open any email attachments or links from unknown sources.</p>
      <p>Trustwave noted that Microsoft will never push patches to its operating systems via email. Microsoft deploys and installs updates to Windows systems through the built-in Windows Update feature.</p>
