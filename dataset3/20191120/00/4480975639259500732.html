          <b>A downside break of 21-day SMA holds the key to further declines towards recent range lows, 200-day SMA.</b>

      <p>GBP/JPY traders look for direction as the pair seesaws between 21-day SMA and 61.8% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> retracement while taking rounds to 140.30 during the Asian session on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>While recent lows near 139.40/35 can offer immediate support to the pair during the downside break of 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) level of 140.07, 200-day SMA around 138.50 will be the key to watch afterward.</p>
      <p>If prices slip below 138.50 on a daily closing basis, sellers targeting 50% Fibonacci retracement of March-August downpour, at 137.76, will sneak in.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, a daily closing beyond 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 140.40 can again push buyers towards late-May high nearing 141.75. Though, pair’s further advances will target 143.80/75 area including multiple lows marked in March and April month.</p>
