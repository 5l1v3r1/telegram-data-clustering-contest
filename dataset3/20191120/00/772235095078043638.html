      <p>The <b>2020 MG HS</b> will launching Australia priced from <b>$30,990</b> drive away for the price-leading Vibe variant, with the range-topping Excite priced from <b>$33,990</b> drive away.</p>
      <p>The MSRP for those two models are $29,990 and $32,990 respectively, and the HS replaces the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mg/gs/">previous GS</a> that Australian buyers will be familiar with.</p>
      <p>Danny Lenartic, MG marketing and product director, is positive about where the brand is headed in Australia.</p>
      <p>"The Australian market has helped us to continue to grow in what has been a challenging year in Australia," he said.</p>
      <p>"We've had opening orders for our first electric model, we've opened our flagship store here at Sydney City MG, which is located in an automotive hub and it's also our spiritual home in Australia."</p>
      <p>“The HS is our new flagship, the most stylish, savvy and our most refined vehicle to date," Lenartic went on to say.</p>
      <p>"The level of tech is unparalleled by any previous MG model launched in Australia, it will be available in two specifications, and is designed to be purposeful, sporty and at home on Australian roads.”</p>

      <p>Akshat Ahuja, MG product planning manager, explained the evolution of the HS and the two model structure.</p>
      <p>"The entry-level is called Vibe, while top spec is called Excite," he said. "The design language evolved from the ZS, now takes the shape of the HS."</p>
      <p>MG HS is well specified, with LED daytime running lights standard – and while Vibe gets halogen headlights, the Excite gets full LED lights as standard.</p>
      <p>Vibe is fitted with 17-inch alloy wheels, while Excite gets 18-inch alloy wheels as standard equipment. Excite also gets LED tail-lights and sequential illumination.</p>
      <p>HS will compete in the ever-growing and fiercely-competitive Medium SUV segment, dominated by the likes of Toyota's RAV4, Mazda's CX-5 and Mitsubishi's Outlander but at launch the dimensions look right.</p>
      <p>It's 4574mm long, 1876mm wide, 1685mm high and sits on a 2720mm wheelbase. Those dimensions are 74mm longer, 21mm wider, and 20mm lower with a wheelbase that's 17mm longer than the ZS.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite initial speculation that a 2.0-litre engine might power the HS, it has launched with a 1.5-litre, turbocharged four-cylinder engine that generates <b>125kW</b> and <b>250Nm</b> and is mated to a seven-speed twin-clutch transmission.</p>
      <p>Crucial safety assistance systems have been included on the HS, and the headline act is 'MG Pilot', which is standard across both variants. There's a visible radar mounted in the front bumper and a camera at the top of the windscreen.</p>
      <p>Both work to activate the MG Pilot systems including adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, traffic jam assist, intelligent cruise assist, blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert, intelligent headlamp control, speed assistance systems (a system that illustrates the legal speed limit).</p>
      <p>The HS does have cyclist detection as well and has been put through ANCAP testing, but MG isn't reporting the rating at the moment.</p>
      <p>Inside the HS cabin there's a flat-bottomed steering wheel, while the Excite gets a Super Sport mode activated by a steering wheel mounted button.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It increases throttle response, shifts at higher RPM, delivers more precise steering, and the ambient lights inside the cabin change to red.</p>
      <p>Both models have steering wheel mounted shift paddles and a 10.1-inch touchscreen. Excite gets standard on-board satellite navigation, while both variants are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.</p>
      <p>There's enough room for the family in the second row, along with a substantial luggage space offering 463 litres with the second row in play. That second row is a 60/40 split fold design and the space opens out to 1287 litres with the seats down.</p>
      <p>The MG HS will come with MG's seven-year/unlimited kilometre warranty and roadside assistance for the same period.</p>
