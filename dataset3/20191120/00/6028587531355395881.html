      <p>In an increasingly connected world, cult outerwear brand, <a href="https://thearrivals.com/">The Arrivals</a> wants humans to explore outdoors without distraction or connectivity.</p>

      <p>To encourage their customers to do so, they’ve introduced the next generation of their <a href="https://thearrivals.com/products/woman-aer-6-0#boltripstop">AER puffer</a> with a Faraday pocket which temporarily blocks all cellular, GPS, Wifi, Bluetooth, RFID and NFC, EMR, EMF and radiation signals to your devices. “With people spending an increasing amount of time indoors and connected to their devices, we were inspired to create an outerwear tool that brought individuals back outdoors,” Jeff Johnson, co-founder and creative director shares. “On average Americans spend approximately 90% of their time indoors so our solution is to offer consumers thoughtfully engineered garments that not only allow them to disconnect from the day-to-day, but refuel that desire to explore the world ‘Out There’.” AER is one of the brand’s most durable styles for harsher weather conditions, so Johnson felt it was only natural to integrate the Off the Grid Pocketing System to this season’s range.</p>

      <p>While there have been bag and accessories manufacturers that have incorporated this anti-electromagnetic technology, The Arrivals is the first to incorporate this in garment form. With new tech inventions that keep us glued to a screen or at home, Jeff Johnson makes it his responsibility to provide simple solutions that celebrate the present.</p>

      <p>Johnson’s background in architecture is injected into every design and iteration with thoughtful elements from structure to hardware, as well as the brand’s retail concepts. The latest pop-up for The Arrivals is labeled the OutThere Lab, a 2,000 square-foot retail space that reinforces the brand’s mission to encourage exploration in the elements. The space was inspired by extreme microclimates with a product offering that acts as a toolkit to help you embrace the elements whether you’re in Atacama or Patagonia.</p>

      <p>An avid traveler himself, we asked Johnson what’s on his bucket list – places that he’d want to experience completely disconnected to take advantage of his own creation. The designer reveals, “The Andean highlands are on the top of my list. I recently spent two weeks in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the northern limits of the Andean Mountain range. Spanning 7 countries, the magnitude and isolation of Andean Highlands completely captivated me.”</p>
      <p>Pricing ranges from $295 - $445 available <a href="https://thearrivals.com/">online</a>. So, turn your “Out Of Office” on and get out there.</p>
