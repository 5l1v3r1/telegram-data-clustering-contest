      <p>HAVANNA, a new elite cigar café for the trendy and discerning adult is set to be opened in Bulawayo today.</p>
      <p>The spot is situated at Copa Cubanna and is an extension of the popular joint.</p>
      <p>A brief visit to Havanna by <i>Chronicle Showbiz</i> yesterday revealed that the spacious spot was ready to open.</p>
      <p>Havanna manager, Chris Mariwande, said: “Havanna is a lifestyle bar that caters for the trendy and upmarket clientele. This is for discerning adults who appreciate the finer things in life.</p>
      <p>“So, I urge people to come and see what we have in store for them at Havanna.”</p>
      <p>He said they were not shutting down Cubanna, but extending the experience of the place by adding Havanna.</p>
      <p>“We’re not shutting down Cubanna as it is running efficiently. There was a need to expand because Cubanna was becoming congested for our patrons, that is why we opened Havanna which is at the back of Cubanna,” said Mariwande.</p>
      <p>“The official launch will be held to allow people to experience the ambience that we have set.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is welcome and there’ll be eats and drinks for sale so that people soak up the atmosphere.”</p>
      <p>Mariwande said Havanna will be open from Wednesday to Saturday and depending on demand, they may increase the days.</p>
      <p>“Havanna will be open from Wednesday to Saturday in the evenings while Cubanna will be open during the day.</p>
      <p>We’ll see as we go if we can open on a daily basis,” he said.</p>
      <p>The opening of Havanna comes at a time when the city is gearing up for the festive season which kickstarted at the beginning of the month.</p>
