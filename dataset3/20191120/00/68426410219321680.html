            <h3>Curaleaf revenue jumps on retail growth</h3>
            <p>Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. said late Tuesday that total revenue for the third quarter of 2019 increased 189 per cent year-over-year to US$61.8 million, compared to US$21.4-million in the third quarter of 2018. Total Revenue for the third quarter of 2019 increased 27 per cent over the second quarter of 2019. The Wakefield, Mass.-based grower, processor and retailer, which operates in several legal U.S. states, said retail and wholesale revenue increased more than threefold to US$50.7-million during the quarter, compared to US$16.6-million in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in retail and wholesale revenue was primarily due to organic growth in Florida, New York and acquisitions in Arizona and Maryland, the company said. Additionally, wholesale revenue increased in Massachusetts as a result of the number of newly opened adult-use dispensaries. Adjusted EBITDA was US$9-million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to a loss of US$3.2-million for the third quarter of 2018. Net loss for the third quarter of 2019 was US$7.4-million, compared to a net loss of $35.6-million in the third quarter of 2018.</p>

                <h3>New York likely to drop case clouded by marijuana-hemp confusion</h3>
                <p>Prosecutors are planning to drop all charges in a New York City case that spotlighted how similarities between legal hemp plants and marijuana can cause confusion. The Brooklyn district attorney’s office said Tuesday that Ronen Levy’s felony marijuana possession case will likely be dismissed Dec. 2. Levy was arrested Nov. 2 after going to a police station to collect 48 kilograms of plants that were seized during shipping from a Vermont farm. They were headed to his brother’s CBD shop. The Levys said the plants were legal hemp used for extracting CBD. Police said a field test came back positive for marijuana, but those tests often can’t distinguish legal hemp from pot.</p>
