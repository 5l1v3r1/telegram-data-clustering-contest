      <p>SOUTHLAND - (INT) - The arrival of another so-called rainy season is welcomed by many but is not without its consequences. <br/><br/>Seasonal fire fighters will soon be sent home as the wildfire danger eases. Some mountain ski resorts are getting back into action. Sun bathing is over for another year. <br/><br/>This weeks two-pronged storm ended a nearly 6-month-long spell without any measureable rain in some localities including Riverside. <br/><br/>Mountain travelers found getting from one place to another problematical. Chains or snow tires were required on some roads Wednesday as the snow level plunged to 3800 feet. Troubled Highway 243 was closed briefly Wednesday between Banning and Twin Pines because of debris flows. The highway was reopened November 1st after an 8-and-a-half-month closure to repair damage from a Valentines Day storm last February. <br/><br/>The Palm Springs Aerial Tramways Annual Snow Guessing Contest officially ended on Wednesday. Ten people correctly guessed the first date that an inch of measureable snow fell at the tramways Mountain Station. <br/><br/>In the desert, unusually heavy rain and flash flooding closed a section of Highway 62 to Route 177.</p>
