      <p>What does it mean to be a high-performing team in today’s business climate? It’s very different than what it used to be. Sure, the ability to get along with others is still paramount but it goes beyond that. The disruption that technology has caused in so many industries has created a business mandate to build teams that create and adapt to the changes needed to keep the company relevant and competitive in the marketplace.Teams have to move from being siloed structures that rely on clear roles and responsibilities and hierarchy to collaborative and autonomously operating organisms, flexing, moving and resizing based on the needs of the business. To do that, leaders have to cultivate a very different culture than what may currently exist for their teams.</p>
      <p>Key things to focus on include:</p>
      <p><b>Build positive intelligence</b>. <i>Positive intelligence</i> is a term coined by best-selling author, speaker and coach, <a href="https://www.positiveintelligence.com/about/">Shirzad Chamine</a>. In his book, <i>Positive Intelligence: Why Only 20% of Teams and Individuals Achieve Their True Potential and How You Can Achieve Yours</i>, he discusses the evolution of mindset from focusing solely on functional intelligence, to including emotional intelligence to now adding positive intelligence. This is the ability to spot opportunities in the face challenges. You can see how critical that might be when the things change so rapidly and often, the changes are seen as dangerous vs. advantageous.</p>
      <p><b>Leverage positive language for development</b>. Speaking with former Navy Seal, bestselling author and entrepreneur, <a href="https://brandontylerwebb.com/">Brandon Webb</a>, he shared how one of the toughest schools, sniper training, used positive language to decrease their failure rates from 30% to only one percent. He shared that pointing out mistakes when someone is in the middle of learning something new doesn’t help them do it better. Instead, they focused on showing the trainees how to do it right. When asked by trainees what would be a good score, they stopped sharing the average score of graduates which was in the 90’s and simply stated it was a 100. This raised the trainees expectations of themselves, in turn, raising their score.</p>
      <p><b>Prioritize decision making over fear. </b>In a culture where being right is paramount, you eliminate the space to experiment and innovate. This can be death to a company. You have to value decision making over fear of being blamed for being wrong. In a fast-paced environment with a lot of unknown variables, focusing on the perfect answer is a recipe for failure.</p>
      <p>In his most recent book, <i>Mastering Fear: A Navy Seal’s Guide</i>, Webb lays out a structured approach to using fear as a fuel to go beyond what we may have thought was possible. "Fear can be a set of manacles, holding you prisoner," writes Webb. "Or it can be a slingshot, catapulting you on to greatness."</p>
      <p>If you and your staff don’t know how to move past the fear, you’ll find yourselves in analysis paralysis. This isn’t about making hasty decisions. It’s about being decisive and moving forward no matter what level of unknown you may be facing.</p>
      <p><b>Require recommendations and solutions when hearing complaints. </b>In his media company, <a href="https://sofrep.com/">SOFREP</a>, Brandon Webb leads by emphasizing the importance of everyone coming to the table with solutions vs. complaints. “Nobody on my team is going to blame or complain…they are going to focus on how to move forward and solve the problem.” He does this by leading via the golden rule he learned while serving in the military of having three possible solutions for any complaint you may have.</p>
      <p><b>Develop skills for productive conflict. </b>Because team structure is less black and white and the need to collaborate across teams, functions and divisions is so much higher than it was just ten years ago, there’s been an increased demand for people who can quickly build trust, respectfully debate and make others feel safe to work with them. In other words, people who are good at productive conflict.</p>
      <p>To be skilled in this area, one needs to feed their curiosity when things aren’t going the way they wanted vs. feeding their anger and fear. It also means setting egos aside and putting the good of the company front and center. It also requires the ability to present clear perspectives and viewpoints without attacking others. Not always an easy task when deadlines loom and pressure mounts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Restructure for commitment to the new culture.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When asked what he thinks are the most critical steps to shifting an established culture into a new direction, Webb admits that it can be tough, especially with people who are used to things being a certain way. You will have some who are glad it’s changing. Some will be on the fence. And others will be firmly against the new way of doing things. It’s the leader’s job to align incentives, support those that are committed to the new culture, win over those on the fence and help those exit that don’t want to come along on the next chapter.</p>
      <p>There’s no perfect recipe for building a high performing team. It requires a great deal of commitment, communication and willingness to experiment and empower. But it could be the difference between creating the future success of your business or causing its demise.</p>
