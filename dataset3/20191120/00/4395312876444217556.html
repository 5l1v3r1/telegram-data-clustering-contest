      <p>Finding inspiration and fulfillment in your job each and every day may seem like a challenge. You will often be presented with situations or tasks you may not be fully passionate about or perhaps hate the idea of doing. Oftentimes the cause of our stress is in the way we perceive a certain task as opposed to the task itself. Here we seek to show you how anyone can be the best at their job every day with a few, simple lifestyle and mindset tweaks.</p>
      <h3>Prioritize Well Being</h3>

      <p>The only way to be the best at your job every day is to be your best self every day. Nothing gets accomplished when you’re stressed, depressed or upset and it’s true how your personal life and working life go hand in hand. If one suffers, so will the other. You may now be wondering; how do I focus on wellbeing?</p>
      <p>Firstly, exercise more and focus on your fitness. By exercising, you are indirectly improving your productivity and ability to focus at work due to improvements in energy, better sleep, and a happier mood. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson">Richard Branson</a>, the founder of the Virgin Group who is worth billions of dollars, has an intense exercise routine consisting of Bikram yoga, rock-climbing, running and weightlifting, which all go into making him a positive and productive person.</p>
      <p>Exercise isn’t the only thing you can do to improve your wellbeing. Meditation is also proven to increase focus, reduce stress and contribute towards a happier life which on the whole will lead you on the path to be the best at your job every day. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeff-weiner">Jeff Weiner</a>, CEO of LinkedIn stated that in order “to avoid feeling overwhelmed or unfocused, I spend about one hour meditating each morning”. So, adopt the habit of meditation and watch your work productivity skyrocket.</p>
      <h3>Focus on What’s Important</h3>
      <p>No matter who you are, we are all given the same 24 hours in a day. What you do in that working time will determine how good you can be at your job. How do you determine the most important tasks?</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that this is highly dependent on the job being done. Warren Buffet and Bill Gates were both asked at one point what the most important factor contributing to their success was, the answer for both was the focus. Many other successful entrepreneurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/pagidips?lang=en">Sidd Pagidipati</a>, founder of Inventcorp and John C. Maxwell, an author and speaker also showcase how focus can play a big part in an individual’s success.</p>
      <p>There are a few important factors when it comes to improving focus, these include taking short breaks, by doing so you give your brain the ability to unwind and perform better when you need to reengage your mind. Turning on some gentle, relaxing music or using binaural beats can also help improve focus. Coffee doesn’t just wake you up but can help you get in the flow for the day and ultimately lead you to perform better in a professional environment.</p>
      <h3>Get Organized</h3>
      <p>To get better at your job, it’s important to get organized and know what you are doing in each hour of the working day. Distraction is prevalent in all areas of life, with email, social media and instant messaging buzzing every minute, knowing when to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324560">shut off from distraction</a> and focus is key to be the best at your job you can be.</p>
      <p>When you think of a distraction, things like email, social media and instant messaging may spring to mind. Although these are huge distractions in people’s lives, there is one that trumps them all. Procrastination. Staying stagnant and procrastinating on what needs doing will result in more wasted time than anything else. This is why staying organized is so important. Organize your daily tasks for each hour of work you plan to do and combine this with the focus activities previously mentioned to triumph in your working life.</p>
      <h3>Develop a Healthy Attitude</h3>

      <p>Your mindset and attitude in life can take you a long way. Even if you aren’t particularly passionate about the work you do, it’s important to see the good in everything, including the tasks you don’t like. Training your mind to be grateful and think positively about all tasks will force you to become a more positive person and in turn make you a more enjoyable person to be around, which will reflect in the quality of your working day.</p>
