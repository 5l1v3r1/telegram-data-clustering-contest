      <h1>New Apple media apps coming to Windows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Apple is currently looking for software developers to help create Windows apps for its media services.</p>
      <p>This is according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1541300853/?src=aff-lilpar&amp;veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&amp;trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&amp;clickid=TVxRUB0FNxyOWKewUx0Mo3EUUkn1L6zBJVhC2c0&amp;irgwc=1"><b>job posting on LinkedIn</b></a> titled “Senior Software Engineer – Windows Media Apps”.</p>
      <p>The job description states that the successful applicant will work on the “next generation of media apps for Windows” and notes that experience in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and cross-platform experience with Mac and Windows is beneficial.</p>
      <p>UWP can be used to build apps for both Windows 10 and the Xbox One, which could indicate that Apple also wants to bring the apps to Microsoft’s consoles.</p>
      <h3>iTunes break-up</h3>
      <p>In June, Apple <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/308331-the-end-of-itunes.html"><b>announced</b></a> it was splitting iTunes into three separate dedicated apps for macOS – Podcasts, TV, and Music.</p>
      <p>Windows users, however, are stuck with the iTunes and iCloud desktop applications.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Windows users with Apple Music and Apple TV+ subscriptions are confined to using the web versions of these services, as there are no dedicated Windows 10 apps available.</p>
      <p>The development of media apps for Windows comes as Apple seems to be taking a more open approach to rival platforms, as it has recently extended several of its services to devices from other brands.</p>
      <p>The Apple TV+ app is available on a range of non-Apple hardware, including Roku devices, Amazon’s Fire TV devices, and Samsung’s Smart TVs.</p>
