      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed new safe streets legislation into law Tuesday that requires the Department of Transportation to issue and implement a citywide transportation plan every five years.</p>
      <p>The legislation, introduced by City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, is the latest step in the city's Vision Zero initiative designed to make streets safer.</p>
      <p>The Streets Master Plan includes eight measures:</p>
      <p>1) 150 miles of protected bus lanes over five years.<br/>2) Transit signal priority at 1,000 intersections per year, with 750 of those in the first year.<br/>3) 250 miles of protected bike lanes over five years.<br/>4) Bus stop upgrades at 500 stops each year.<br/>5) Redesigning at least 2,000 signalized intersections.<br/>6) Accessible pedestrian signals at no fewer than 2,500 intersections.<br/>7) Assessing and amending commercial loading zones and truck routes.<br/>8) Developing parking policies to improve safety, mass transit, accessibility, etc.</p>
      <p>"I'm proud to sign this new safe streets legislation that will further the ambitious commitments we've begun under Vision Zero," de Blasio said. "We thank Speaker Johnson for his leadership and look forward to continuing our work with elected officials and communities on creating new bus lanes and protected bike lanes in their districts even before this new plan takes effect. Over the next two years, we will continue to lay the critical groundwork that will allow this plan to be put into motion on Day One, and we are confident that this new plan firmly cements New York City's reputation as the nation's leader on street safety."</p>
      <p>In addition, within the first two years, the plan would implement 1 million square feet of pedestrian space.</p>
      <p>"Today, we take a giant leap closer to reclaiming our streets and making them safer for our residents," Johnson said. "The Streets Master Plan, now signed into law, will revolutionize the way New Yorkers use our streets, creating more bus and bike lanes, more pedestrian space and safer street infrastructure. This law helps us make alternative transportation options more viable, which is necessary in our fight against climate change. Today would not have been possible without the hard work of transportation and street safety advocates, including families who lost love ones on our dangerous streets. Their persistence and passion led to a plan that will ultimately make New York City a more enjoyable place to live, work and play. New Yorkers for generations to come will be safer because of them."</p>
      <p>The new law requires DOT to implement a master plan for street design every five years and contains specific targets for protected bike lanes, accessible pedestrian signals, transit signal priority and stop upgrades for buses, and new pedestrian public space. As part of the first master plan, the city will build 50 miles of protected bus lanes and 30 miles of protected bike lanes annually.</p>
