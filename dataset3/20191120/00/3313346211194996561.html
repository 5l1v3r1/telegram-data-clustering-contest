      <p><b>Newsbrief: </b><i>Pokemon Sword </i>and <i>Pokemon Shield</i> have amassed over 1.36 million physical sales in Japan during their first three days on shelves.</p>
      <p>That's according to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/201911/20187303.html">the latest figures from Famitsu</a> (<a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/pokemon-sword-and-shield-sold-1-36-million-retail-copies-in-first-three-days-in-japan">via Gematsu</a>), which factor in sales of retail copies, download cards, and the Pokemon Sword and Shield Double Pack -- but not digital sales.</p>
      <p>It's a total that means <i>Pokemon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> have performed better on home soil than fellow Switch-exclusive <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i>, which <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/332832/Super_Smash_Bros_Ultimate_breaks_the_series_launch_sales_record_in_Japan.php">sold 1.23 million units in three days</a> to set a new launch sales record for the series.</p>
