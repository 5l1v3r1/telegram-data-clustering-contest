      <h1>Ryan Giggs hails Wales' Euro 2020 exploits as 'greatest day of my life'</h1>
      <h2>Wales qualified for their second European Championships in a row after two Aaron Ramsey goals helped them see off Hungary and finish second in Group E</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:44:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:44</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Wales manager Ryan Giggs said helping his country qualify for Euro 2020 was among the greatest days of his life following their 2-0 win over Hungary at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> City Stadium.</p>
      <p>A brace from Aaron Ramsey meant Wales finished second in their group and therefore qualified automatically for next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>Giggs won 13 Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues as a player at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> but never represented his country at a major tournament, and the 45-year-old said leading Wales to the European Championships was among the proudest of all his achievements in football.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sky Sports, Giggs said: "It doesn't get any better, it's amazing! From where we were in the summer, all credit to the lads for coming back. One of the best days of my life.</p>

      <p>"We defended really well, we can play better. Overall two goals and a clean sheet and they didn't really trouble us apart from the one save from Wayne Hennessey.</p>
      <p>"This side can do a lot more. There is quality in the squad, not just the starting 11. Every player has shown their class, some of the lads were on their last legs at the end there."</p>
      <p>Giggs also reserved special praise for Ramsey, who was ruled out of the majority of Wales' qualifying campaign due to injury before he returned against Azerbaijan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He added: "Aaron Ramsey has shown that class, his finishes - we missed him! Better late than never I suppose.</p>

      <p>"To be honest I haven't really thought about what it means personally - there's been a lot of hard work put in and I am blessed with the best staff I could ask for."</p>
      <p>The result means Wales will try to emulate their heroic performances in Euro 2016, when they made it to the semi-finals before eventually being knocked out by eventual winners Portugal.</p>
