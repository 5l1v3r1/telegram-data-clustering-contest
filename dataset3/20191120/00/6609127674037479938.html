      <p>Another 793 had to hang around for more than eight hours in the week ending November 10.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government’s target of having 95 per cent of patients dealt with inside four hours has not been hit since August 2017.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said Health Secretary Jeane Freeman made “big promises” on tackling waiting times but “can’t escape the fact the SNP Government hasn’t met the A&amp;E target for years”.</p>
      <p>Mr Cole-Hamilton, the party’s health spokesman, added: “To offer patients a bright future, staff must have the resources they need to do their job.”</p>
      <p>Just 84.6 per cent of people were seen in under four hours — the lowest rate since March last year. It meant a whopping 4,338 people spent over four hours in A&amp;E.</p>
      <p>The largest health board, NHS Greater Gla- sgow and Clyde, hit the target. in just 80.9 per cent of cases.</p>
      <p>An SNP Government spokeswoman said: “Scotland’s core A&amp;E departments have been the best performing in the UK for more than four years despite high attendance levels.”</p>
