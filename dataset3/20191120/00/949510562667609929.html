      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — New uncertainty hangs over the Democratic presidential primary as 10 candidates meet on the debate stage once again.</p>
      <p>No longer is there a clear front-runner, the fight for African American voters is raging and concerns are growing that impeachment may become a distraction from the primary.</p>
      <p>Those issues and more will play out Wednesday night when the Democratic Party’s top 10 face off in Atlanta just 75 days before primary voting begins. The debate will be carried live by MSNBC.</p>
      <p>Turbulent polling across the first states to vote in the presidential primary has created a murky picture of the top tier of Democratic candidates. A sign of whom the candidates themselves consider to be out in front may come during the debate. Usually the perceived leader takes the most heat.</p>
