      <p>Senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan on November 20 said that the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will be able to form a "strong and stable" government "at the earliest".</p>
      <p>"There are some discussions that need to happen which will happen today or tomorrow and I am confident that a stable government will be in place soon," the former chief minister of Maharashtra said.</p>
      <p>Chavan, who addressed the press along with NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik, said that the discussion between the two parties at NCP chief Sharad Pawar's residence had been "very positive".</p>
      <p>"Congress-NCP together decided that we must give an alternate govt in Maharashtra. It is not possible without NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena coming together. We are trying our best to resolve all issues. We will provide alternate govt as soon as possible," Malik told news agency ANI.</p>
      <p>Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, Jairam Ramesh, Mallikarjun Kharge, Prithviraj Chavan, K C Venugopal and Balasaheb Thorat attended the meeting.</p>
      <p>Those representing the NCP included Supriya Sule, Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Nawab Malik.</p>
      <p>Moneycontrol had earlier <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/maharashtra-government-formation-congress-ncp-might-finalise-contours-of-common-minimum-programme-in-meeting-today-4657261.html">reported </a>that senior leaders from Congress and the NCP are likely to finalise the contours of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) andÂ "other aspects" of government formation during today's meet.</p>
      <p>"We had decided that we will not set a fixed timeline and rush into things. We will weigh in every aspect before taking a final call on anything, and that is what we are doing. But it is likely that if all goes well, a final deal might come into place before the first week of December," a source had said.</p>
