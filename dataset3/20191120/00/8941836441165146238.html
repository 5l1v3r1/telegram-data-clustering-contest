        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Secretary of State <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pompeo/">Mike Pompeo</a> has announced U.S policy toward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>’s “settlements” is reverting to one held by the Reagan administration; that is the right of Israelis to settle in the ancient lands of Judea and Samaria “is not, per se, inconsistent with international law.”</p>
      <p>This is good news, not only for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> and its right to national security and sovereignty, but after seven decades of enemy attempts to eradicate the Jewish state it says to the world, “time’s up.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>’s enemies have had the most generous offers to live in peace, including the relinquishing of land captured by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> after many aggressive and unprovoked wars and terrorist attacks. With ongoing propaganda statements by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>’s enemies, the firing of rockets into civilian areas from Gaza and elsewhere, and ongoing sermons attempting to justify the violent overthrow of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> and the murder of Jews, a reality check is long overdue.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>, under all of its prime ministers, has gone more than halfway trying to make peace. The responses have been as if no outreaches were ever made. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> and the West have a right to question the sincerity of those Arab and Muslin nations when they continue to denounce and defame <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> and the Jewish people as illegitimate occupiers of “Palestinian” land. As long as such denial continues, there can be no opportunity for peace and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> is well within its rights to defend itself against such ominous and ongoing verbal, theological and military threats.</p>
      <p>It is and always has been wishful thinking to believe that people motivated by hate, a mandate from Allah to conduct what would amount to genocide against Jews and revisionist history as to the original owners of “occupied land,” would miraculously change their minds and agree to reverse decades of provocations and proof of their ultimate objective. </p>

      <p>This has always been the danger when Westerners believe all humans are alike and given the right incentives can be persuaded to act in ways consistent with Western values and practices.</p>
      <p>The next step is for the Israeli Knesset to validate the Trump administration’s new policy, which aligns with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ultimate goal.</p>
      <p>As reported in the Jerusalem Post, “Likud MK Sharren Haskel proposed the bill weeks ago, but decided to fast-track it in light of the change in U.S. policy. Haskel submitted a request to exempt her bill to annex the Jordan Valley from the mandatory six-week waiting period for any new legislation, so that it can go to a vote in the plenum next week.”</p>
      <p>Columnist Caroline Glick wrote for the publication Israel Hayot, “In the interest of promoting peace, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pompeo/">Pompeo</a> instead told the truth. Not only are Israeli settlements not illegal. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pompeo/">Pompeo</a> noted that they are arguably more justified than civilian settlements built in other disputed territories.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“In his words, the administration’s determination ‘is based on the unique facts, history, and circumstances presented by the establishment of civilian settlements in the West Bank.’ That is, it is based on the historic ties of the Jewish people to Judea and Samaria. These ties lay at the heart of Jewish history and religion.”</p>
        <p>Indeed, they do. Now if the European Union, whose hatred of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> goes back to the shameless days of Nazi anti-Semitism, and is now resurging, would only see the light and end its recently announced policy to require “goods from illegal settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories to be labeled as such,” perhaps some real steps forward might occur.</p>
        <p>As long as a religious motivation for wiping out <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> persists, there will be no peace, and no two-state solution. It is why the Trump administration’s position on the legality of settlements in Judea and Samaria is not only correct, but a necessary contribution to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>’s security and any true peace, or at least stability.</p>
