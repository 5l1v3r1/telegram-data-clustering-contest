      <h1>Stocks - U.S. Futures Fall as Trump Reiterates China Tariff Threats </h1>

      <p>Investing.com - U.S. futures tumbled on Wednesday after President Donald Trump repeated threats to increase tariffs against China if the two sides do not reach a trade deal soon.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. His comments spooked investors, who have been sensitive to trade developments. Beijing and Washington are working on a “phase one” deal to end their 17-month impasse but so far no details on progress have come forth.</p>
      <p>Tensions were exasperated by the U.S. Senate passing legislation backing Hong Kong protesters, that would ban the export of items like tear gas and rubber bullets to the city's police force, as conflict between the two sides escalated this week. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang lashed out against the vote, saying it “seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations.”</p>
