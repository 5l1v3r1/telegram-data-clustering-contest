      <h1>Planning to emigrate to Australia? Better think twice</h1>

      <p>Australia’s unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 5.3 percent in October, up 0.4 percentage point from the beginning of this year. The underemployment rate also climbed to 8.5 percent.</p>
      <p>Australia is one of the most popular immigration destinations for Hongkongers. But those planning to live down under better think twice because it’s getting increasingly difficult to find a job there.</p>
      <p>The total number of jobs in the country fell by 19,000 in October, compared with market expectations of an increase of 15,000. It’s the first decline in nearly two years.</p>
      <p>Although the economy is benefiting from the surging prices of gold and iron ore, which are expected to lift the country’s natural resources exports to a new high this year, leading mining companies like BHP Billiton and Newcrest Mining are actually shedding jobs as a result of automation.</p>
      <p>The trickle-down effect from the mining boom will thus be very limited.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, retail sales dropped 0.2 percent in the 12 months to September from a year ago, something not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has already taken swift action and cut interest rates thrice this year to a record low of 0.75 percent.</p>
      <p>The Australian government has also rolled out fiscal measures to boost the economy, including a A$158 billion (US$107.53 billion) tax cut plan it unveiled in July.</p>
      <p>But so far, these measures don’t seem to be working.</p>
      <p>Unless one has enough assets to support themselves without having a regular job, or has very much sought-after skills, whoever wants to emigrate to Australia must be prepared to have a tough time in finding a job.</p>
