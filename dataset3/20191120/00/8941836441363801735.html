      <p>GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) - The Latest on a possible norovirus outbreak that has shuttered schools in western Colorado (all times local):</p>
      <p>4:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>All 46 schools in a western Colorado district have been closed for cleaning because of a possible norovirus outbreak among students and staff.</p>
      <p>Colorado Public Radio reports six of the schools in Mesa County had closed as of Wednesday afternoon before the districtwide shutdown was announced. All the schools also will be closed Friday heading into the Thanksgiving break, which lasts the entire week of the holiday from Nov. 25 to Nov. 29.</p>
      <p>Tanya Marvin, the school district’s nursing coordinator, says, “We are taking this highly unusual action because this virus is extremely contagious and spreading quickly.”</p>
