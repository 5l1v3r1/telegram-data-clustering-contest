      <p>Slack, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Gmail. These are among the many platforms we now use to communicate every day, and they all flow into one device primarily: our smartphones. In some ways, our phones make life immeasurably easier. In under a minute, we can congratulate a coworker on a promotion, say happy birthday to a friend, ask a colleague about a deliverable or ping our spouse with a quick question. Yet our phones are also complicating our lives by fragmenting our attention and draining our productivity. With so much information streaming into (and out of) one ultra-accessible device, our focus is increasingly split between the present moment and our pocket-sized screens.</p>
      <p>We all know the drill: every day, multiple times an hour, be it at home or on the job, we check our phones—only to re-check moments later. Logically, we know our messages aren’t going anywhere, so what’s driving this urge? The answer is digital addiction, a phenomenon that has a lot to do with the brain’s reaction to the hyper-accessible, always-on-call state that is the 21st century.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Psychology Behind Your Addiction</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’ve come to expect our phones to beep and buzz all day; it’s the new norm. Because of the way we evolved socially, the brain registers each <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">notification as a potential communication- positive</a>. With every new alert, the brain releases dopamine, a “feel good” neurotransmitter. However, the opposite is also true: if some time passes and we don’t receive an alert, anxiety begins gnawing at us, asking, “What if I’m missing something important?” We check our phones to alleviate that anxiety, but—and here’s the catch 22—many actions that ameliorate anxiety also prompt the release of dopamine. Whether we realize it or not, with every glance at our phones, we’re being rewarded on a neuro-chemical level. Adding to this is a curious complication: the brain only releases dopamine when there’s an appropriate stimulus, while at the same time trying to anticipate the next reward.</p>
      <p>However, since phone alerts are intermittent, there’s no way of predicting the next dopamine-dose, meaning that some part of our brain now lives in a perpetual state of uncertainty. The upshot is that we sometimes check our phones simply because we’ve gone too long without a dopamine rush.</p>
      <p>Digital addiction isn’t just behavioral, it’s chemical, and it’s a tough cycle to break all around. Since orphaning our phones isn’t feasible in today’s world, here are four ways we can foster digital wellness while boosting productivity.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Multitasking Myth</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many of us believe we’re expert multitaskers. We can boil a pot of noodles, answer a text, feed the dog and email our boss, all in the same moment. But can we, really?</p>
      <p>Researchers have long understood that <a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask">multitasking is hard on the brain</a> . While we <i>think</i> we’re increasing productivity by doing several things at once, we’re actually <i>decreasing</i> it by inviting in errors and confusion. This is because the brain strongly prefers single cognitive tasks. We can toggle quickly between tasks—and this <i>feels</i> like multitasking—but we can only focus with precision on one thing at a time. When we try to split our attention, we’re essentially tiring out the brain.</p>
      <p>Because our phones perforate the otherwise natural compartmentalization of our lives—office, home, social life—they very much reinforce the multitasking myth. With every seemingly innocuous glance at our screen, we are in fact redirecting our attention from something else. Case in point: <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/state-laws/issues/Distracted-Driving">48 states currently have bans on texting and driving</a>, because we really can’t do both at once.</p>
      <p>At work in particular, it’s important to cultivate a digital environment conducive to focus. When you’re working on a specific project, the first and perhaps most crucial step is silencing your phone and moving it out of sight. (This may cause some anxiety at first. If so, set a hard boundary: after thirty minutes of work, you can check your phone—but not before.) Beyond this, create a modified silent mode on your computer that works in tandem with your phone-free focus. Close all tabs on your browser that don’t relate specifically to your project. Exit any unneeded programs. Sign out of email, log out of Skype. Then take a cleansing breath and give yourself permission to concentrate.</p>
      <p>In lessening digital distraction, you’re shifting your full attention to your most important task—that project—which will allow you to complete your work more thoroughly and quickly. Deep focus also has the added benefit of distracting the brain from any phone-related dopamine cravings, ameliorating another barrier to concentration. By working with your brain’s “one thing at a time” need, your productivity may very well skyrocket.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Smartphone Codependence</b>
      </p>
      <p>For many of us, we now use our phones in place of a computer for Internet-based tasks. No longer do we need to be at our desks to send an email or answer a Slack message—our phones can do it all, every waking moment of every single day.</p>
      <p>However, if you’re over-depending on your phone, you’ve probably noticed that a sinking feeling can begin settling in when you put it down for long stretches, especially if you don’t have a task to occupy your focus. Nervousness, agitation or simply a general sense of something being “off” can often accompany being separated from your device. What is that, and why does it happen?</p>
      <p>That feeling is your cortisol level rising, a hormonal stress-reaction. (Cortisol is one of the hormones that triggers our infamous fight-or-flight mode). While much research has been dedicated to the dopamine connection, researchers are now exploring the effects of our phones on <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/2/119/4067530">cortisol levels as well</a>. Maybe it’s no surprise that phone-use is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/well/mind/putting-down-your-phone-may-help-you-live-longer.html">source of stress</a>, but, oddly enough, our phones can cause generalized stress even when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cell-phone-sabotages-productivity-2018-3">we’re not using them</a>. This can inhibit the work we do and the choices we make.</p>
      <p>Balance is key to mitigating generalized phone-related stress. Not everything in our lives needs to be digitally tethered, even though it may seem that way. Try purposefully engaging in non-digital tasks at least a few times a week—writing meeting notes by hand, reading a magazine in lieu of your kindle, doing a pen-and-paper crossword puzzle, watching the sunset after work. Periodically giving yourself a few non-digital minutes will offer you a break from phone-related cortisol spikes and help you recharge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Panic: Keeping Up With Your Phone</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’ve all done it. A Skype message comes in and we begin answering it, but then we get distracted by a WhatsApp pop-up. Five minutes later, we think we’ve answered the Skype message, but the next day, we find our half-drafted response sitting unsent. It’s an embarrassing moment, one that can leave us scrambling.</p>
      <p>It happens. Our phones are high-traffic areas, and often we’re simply spread too thin. With so many apps and messages vying for our attention, it’s easy to believe we’ve completed a task when we haven’t. At this frantic pace, how is anyone supposed to keep up? A little digital maintenance can help.</p>
      <p>First, turn off as many alerts from as many platforms as you can. (Most apps offer some level of customization in this vein.) Think of how these notifications impact you and your day. While it may be beneficial to receive an alert when a direct-message on Facebook arrives, do you really need a pop-up every time a friend of a coworker’s friend comments on your post? Or perhaps following Slack threads is an important part of your department’s culture, but you can probably do without alerts for routine Human Resources threads.</p>
      <p>Secondly, devote specific times daily for reviewing everything that’s landed in your phone. For example, at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., take fifteen minutes to scroll through all your notifications. Confirm that you’ve given due attention to each, then delete anything you don’t need. Check your drafts folders to guard against that wayward unsent message; if you find one, read it over now that you’re less frenzied and make any needed edits. This system doesn’t mean you can’t answer your messages throughout the day, but it does mean that you’ll stay on top of everything that much more easily. Your focus and productivity will thank you for it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Quick Responses—Enemy or Friend?</b>
      </p>
      <p>With your phone always within arm’s reach, it’s tempting to fire off replies without much thought. Yet not all messages are equal, nor can your replies be, especially at work. Today, your professional persona <i>includes</i> the messages you tap out on your screen; responding appropriately is now a part of your job.</p>
      <p>Sometimes quick messages at work can get the job done. If you’re on a site visit, rushing into a meeting or doing your final review before a presentation, it may be okay to respond to your boss on the fly, if only to signal that you’re attentive but occupied. Be polite.</p>
      <p>Yet quick replies can hurt you if you’re not careful. When you’re writing to a manager about something important, it’s on you to present yourself professionally. Think about the content you need to communicate and the best tone to use. Consider writing your reply on your computer—not your phone—so you can craft your message more precisely, as well as proofread it more easily. Include all relevant information; sending a scattered string of messages rather than a single thorough one never looks professional.</p>
      <p>Putting extra thought and effort into your important replies will delay your response time by a few minutes, but that’s a <i>good </i>thing. Not only will you nail your tone, but your mind will also begin considering additional information, nurturing a richer thought process. By routinely examining the type of response that’s most appropriate, you’ll shine through your words.</p>
      <p>Even though smartphones are a newer phenomenon, hyper-connectedness is here to stay. In this new digital world, it’s important to mitigate addiction and mindfully engage in well being practices. With just a little awareness and effort, you can foster a healthier relationship with your phone, transforming it into a productivity powerhouse.</p>
