      <p>While excitement for 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technology, might be in the air for paramedics across the country <a href="https://newsroom.bt.com/uhb-and-bt-demonstrate-uks-first-remote-diagnostic-procedure-using-a-5g-connected-ambulance/">following BT Enterprise’s demonstration last week</a>, some experts think it could be premature. The demonstration, which took place at the University Hospital in Birmingham, involved an acting emergency department consultant advising a paramedic who was situated just under two miles away in a 5G connected ambulance. Using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets, the consultant gave information on the “patient” directly to the paramedic, saving them travelling to the A&amp;E department.</p>
      <p>According to FullFact, in October 2019, <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Timeseries-monthly-Adjusted-October-2019-bv6tg.xls">83.6% of patients</a> attending <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/03/AE-Attendances-Emergency-Definitions-v2.0-Final.pdf#page=7">all types</a> of A&amp;E departments in England were admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. The lowest level on record (2010). It has been suggested that this demonstration shows how levels could be improved.</p>
      <p>“Currently the urgent care system is based on a model navigating against huge numbers of patients every day,” says Lucy Baker, technology director at BT Enterprise. “Since the creation of the NHS 70 years ago, major changes have taken place that challenge the quality of care that the health service can deliver.</p>
      <p>“Increased life expectancy and the resulting ageing population will increasingly put substantial strain on NHS resources, raising questions about its sustainability, and by 2020, 20 per cent of the UK population will be over 65 and likely to be receiving treatment for one or more long-term conditions, for circa 15 years on average,” she continues.</p>

      <p>Reports over the recent years have also seen ambulances experiencing delays, waiting to get into the hospital, patients being treated in car parks by nurses and hospitals actually asking patients to stay away from the A&amp;E department unless it is urgent.</p>
      <p>BT’s demonstration seemingly provides an alternative for procedures that can be done safely outside the A&amp;E department. “The characteristics of 5G mean it will provide many advantages, including speeding up diagnoses for patients and potentially reducing the number of ambulance and A&amp;E department visits,” explains Baker. “In particular, being able to perform diagnoses remotely means a doctor or clinician could determine an appropriate care pathway without necessarily having to see someone in hospital, responding directly to the waiting times issue as above.</p>
      <p>“In addition, by linking hospital clinicians with community practitioners and paramedics in real-time using the power of 5G, we can improve the first point of triage,” she continues. “This can reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and ensure patients get the appropriate treatment upon arrival at hospital – all by diagnosing earlier in the field. This is particularly beneficial for the elderly, frail or for infants needing urgent medical treatment.”</p>
      <p>According to the GSMA, 5G is expected deployed fully in the next three years and could account for up to 1.2 billion connections by 2025, with networks covering one-third of the world’s population. This next generation network is expected to enable robust real-time connectivity, providing high speeds and low latency, according to Vodafone.</p>
      <h3>But is 5G feasible for the ambulance service?</h3>
      <p>“To truly address the feasibility of 5G within the emergency services, we must address the question of infrastructure,” explains Ian West, head of telecoms, media and technology, KPMG U.K. “We will require coverage across the region at a high degree of reliability; these are truly life and death situations, where a dropped line or a frozen screen could make all the difference.</p>
      <p>“At present not all mobile network providers are offering the same coverage on 5G, and only two thirds of the country can currently receive full coverage on 4G,” he continues. West also point out that 5G will see additional demands from “over-air updates and in-car navigation” which will need increased wireless bandwidth and stability.</p>
      <p>There is also the legacy being left by the upgrade to the emergency services network (ESN). The government expects that 300,000 frontline emergency service users, using handheld devices or operating equipment in 50,000 vehicles, 115 aircraft and 200 control rooms, who will depend on ESN, however the roll-out to date hasn’t been plain sailing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubacc/1755/1755.pdf">According to a report in June 2019</a> by the Public Accounts Committee, the deployment of the 4G communication network is expected to be three years later and will cost the taxpayer at least £3.1 billion more than planned. The chair of the committee, Meg Hillier Labour Co-Op MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, said at the time: “The key technology behind the ESN is not yet fully proven and we were not convinced that the Home Office has the capability and plans to deliver a coherent single system that provides the functionality and dependability the emergency services demand.”</p>
      <h3>With 4G proving a challenge to the U.K. Home Office, is there much hope for 5G being used within the emergency services?</h3>
      <p>James Gray, director of Graystone strategy, who works with operators, Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) and partners on what 5G will bring to consumers and businesses in the short and longer term, thinks there could be some further hurdles: “The key question is what are the applications that need the high speed data and capacity that 5G delivers?</p>
      <p>“Things like VR and complex imaging are on the list but it is likely that they will carry some significant equipment costs and training overheads to male them happen,” he explains. “So the question then becomes one of investment rather than coverage and applications being available or mature enough.”</p>
      <p>Posing a difficult question to the U.K. government, Gray asks: “Is it better to invest more in existing infrastructure, air ambulances, doctors and nurses on board ambulances, or in the high tech kit and training that makes doctors virtually available?”</p>
      <p>If the technology isn’t yet fit for purpose and the costs will become a burden to the taxpayer, it looks like 5G-connected ambulances could remain a concept in the years to come.</p>
