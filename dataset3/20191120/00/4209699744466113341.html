      <p>Count eight reads, “That you Abdulrasheed Abdullahi Maina and Igwe Ann Olachi on or about 23 August, 2010 in Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court dishonestly received an aggregate sum of N20,198,400 (twenty million, one hundred and ninety eight thousand naira only) from Jolance Integrated Concept Limited through Ganiyu Owolabi Rasaki and Salami Kareem Adesokan knowing that the said money was stolen from  the Federal Government of Nigeria under the guise of contract for biometric enrolment of pensioners.</p>

Lamurde, Chairman” under the guide of payment for official Estacode.”</p>
      <p>Maina is currently facing a 12-count bordering on money laundering, operating fictitious bank accounts and fraud.</p>
      <p>This is after the court had ordered the forfeiture of 23 property linked to him.</p>
      <p>A former chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Maina was arrested by operatives of the Department of State Services at a hotel in Abuja after allegedly sneaking into the country from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, following a four-year hunt for him.</p>
      <p>The Federal Civil Service Commission had dismissed him in 2013 for absconding from duty following recommendation by the office of the Head of Service after he was accused of being involved in a N2bn pension fraud.</p>
      <p>A warrant for his arrest was soon issued after an investigation by the Senate Joint Committee on Public Service Establishment.</p>
      <p>He was subsequently declared wanted by the police after he disappeared from public glare.</p>
      <p>But in 2017, he returned to Nigeria under controversial circumstances and was soon reinstated as a Director in the Ministry of Interior – an incident, which led to crisis between Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari, and Head of Service at the time – Winifred Oyo-Ita.</p>
      <p>However, following outrage by Nigerians, President Buhari ordered Maina's immediate sack and called for a detailed inquiry into his re-appearance and reinstatement in the federal civil service.</p>
