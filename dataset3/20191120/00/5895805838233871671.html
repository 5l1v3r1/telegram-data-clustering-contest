      <p>When we think of improving our lives, we tend to think of adding or changing, but pruning your life’s weak wood often helps more. Here’s a checklist. Should you prune any of these from your life?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your boss, a coworker, supervisee, customer, or vendor. If you can’t prune them out, can you cut back your involvement with them?</li>
        <li>A romantic partner.</li>
        <li>A friend.</li>
        <li>A family member.</li>
        <li>An onerous form of exercise—perhaps jogging or that modern torture chamber, the gym? Should you replace it with, for example, a daily walk or hike with a friend? Basketball? Yoga at home or in a class? The experts recommend 30 to 45 minutes of exercise five or six days a week. Are you spending more than that? If so, there probably are better uses of your time.</li>
        <li>Screen time. Some TV, video games, social media, music videos?</li>
        <li>Overeating. Is it time to prune your kitchen of calorie-dense temptations, perhaps one or more of the <i>3 Ch's</i>: chips, cheese, or chocolate? Or find a substitute for your after-work reward other than Calorie City?</li>
        <li>Spending. How about pruning some of your spending? For example, do you cringe at each month’s credit card bill? Are you getting your money’s worth from that club membership? From the payments on that fancy car? Do you want to prune daily restaurant lunches or $6 grande lattes with a shot of almond?</li>
        <li>Health no-nos. Is it finally time to put out that ciggie for good? The vape pen? The booze?</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting">Parenting</a> temper. Pruning applies not just to things but to behavior. For example, in parenting your child, are you letting yourself show fury or even hit your kid? At best, that works only in the short run. Longer term, you, your child, and your child’s children will likely pay the price of your modeling that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a> or even violence is an appropriate response to frustration.</li>
        <li>How about pruning your home of "stuff?" Is your home approaching hoarder heaven? Should you, perhaps with a friend, purge most of it and fill any emotional hole that the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/hoarding-disorder">hoarding</a> was aimed at filling with good work, creative outlets, friends, and love? Lest you think I’m only about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-harm">cutting</a>, is there something, like the ugly couch that’s your living room’s centerpiece, that should be pruned out and replaced?</li>
        <li>Religion. Do you want to prune out or cut back your involvement in religion? Some people’s lives are greatly enhanced by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/spirituality">belief</a> in God and prayer, and by religion’s ritual and community. But other people remain religious out of habit and unjustified <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/guilt">guilt</a>, perhaps because they had a religious parent. Is it time to join <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/">America’s fastest growing religious group: No religion?</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The takeaway: </b>Pruning your life’s weak wood allows your roots to send all its energy to the good in your life. Rather than adding or changing, pruning may be the most likely way to make your 2020 your best yet.</p>
