      <h1>Pramit Jhaveri, who brought scale to Citi India, quits</h1>
      <h2>Jhaveri resignation was announced by the Citi Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Babej over email to the employees, the sources said.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Pramit Jhaveri, the former country head of Citi India, has quit for unspecified reasons, sources said on November 20.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Jhaveri had joined the Wall Street major as a management associate in 1987, and had a steady rise to become vice-chairman of banking, capital markets and advisory for Asia Pacific earlier this year, after heading the India operations for almost a decade between 2010 and 2019.</p>
      <p>His resignation was announced by the Citi Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Babej over email to the employees, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Babej's mail lists out the key milestones in Jhaveri's 32-year-long association with Citi, including his leadership of India operations.</p>
      <p>"Jhaveri's leadership, partnership and friendship will be missed across our firm," the memo, which was reviewed by PTI, said.</p>
      <p>A Citi spokesperson confirmed the development but without offering details.</p>
      <p>"Jhaveri has decided to retire from Citi. During his tenure, he built a strong team and established Citi as a market leader," the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Under his helm, Citi India's total assets almost doubled (95.48 percent to be precise) between FY10 and FY19, to Rs 1.86 lakh crore, while gross non-performing assets improved to 1.37 percent in March 2019 from 3.43 percent in March 2010.</p>
      <p>Net profit has grown 386 percent to Rs 4,185 crore in the same period, when a majority of domestic banks were passing through a tumultuous period.</p>
      <p>When he took over, the bank was witnessing a surge in bad loans in its unsecured portfolio and he went in for a restructuring, which resulted in the shuttering of 280 branches of Citifinancial, its in-house NBFC.</p>
      <p>There was also an instance of an internal fraud in its wealth management business in 2010, which was reported to be up to Rs 350 crore.</p>
