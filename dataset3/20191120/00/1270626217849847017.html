      <p>Police Commissioner Sitiveni Qiliho says a parallel internal investigation is also being conducted in the case where three Police</p>
      <p>Constables allegedly assaulted and poured hot water on a man last Monday. </p>
      <p>Qiliho says in this internal investigation the officers allegedly involved will also face internal disciplinary tribunal proceedings. </p>
      <p>He had said that the Director of Internal Affairs is investigating whether there were attempts to cover up the issue by the officers allegedly involved. </p>
      <p>Qiliho has given a deadline until this Friday. </p>
      <p>Apart from the Internal Affairs investigation, the three police constables have each been charged with one count of Act Intended to Cause Grievous Harm and will appear in the Suva Magistrates Court this afternoon. </p>
      <p>The man who was arrested from his home in Navua last Monday morning claims that police officers allegedly poured hot water on him during the questioning process.</p>
      <p>He sustained burns and has since been admitted at the Navua Hospital.</p>
