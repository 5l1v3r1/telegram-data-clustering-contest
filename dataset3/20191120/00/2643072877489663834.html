      <h1>Kogi Election Was Free, Fair And Credible – Yahaya Bello Insists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Kogi State, Governor <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello/"><u><b>Yahaya Bello</b></u></a>, has claimed that the electoral process in the state was free, fair and credible.</p>
      <p>The Kogi State governor claimed that there was a level playing field for all political parties during the election in the state.</p>
      <p>Bello while speaking on Channels TV breakfast programme, Sunrise Today, said despite the recorded violence, the election was free and fair.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“The conduct of the election was quite very credible, a level-playing field was provided and it was free and fair. In every election, there is bound to be one issue or the other and you can’t take a pocket of issues to judge the general conduct of the election.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Regarding the comment of the civil society organisation, they are entitled to their own opinion but let us know the parameters with which they are judging this election.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“How many polling units did they visit out of 2,548 polling units, 239 wards and 21 local governments across the difficult terrains of this state? How many people have they reached out to?”</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Have they interviewed all the electorates? So what are their yardsticks.?”</i> The governor queried.</p>
      <p>Recall that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/"><u><b>Naija News</b></u></a> had reported that <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/19/thugs-burn-kogi-pdp-women-leader-to-death/"><u><b>the women leader of the Peoples Democratic Party was burnt alive in her residence</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>With numerous reports of violence, INEC had declared Bello winner after polling 406,222 votes to defeat his closest rival, Musa Wada of PDP, who scored 189,704 votes.</p>
