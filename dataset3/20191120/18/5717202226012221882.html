      <p>Mourinho arrives having been out of work for just under a year after leaving Manchester United in December 2018.</p>
      <p>The work will begin immediately for the Portuguese tactician, with West Ham United next up for Spurs in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take the next couple of days to get to know his new players in training, and one man who will be hoping to catch his eye is youngster Oliver Skipp.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – McTominay rise will encourage Skipp</h3>
      <p>Some Tottenham fans have expressed concern that Mourinho could be a barrier to the younger players’ route to the first-team.</p>

      <p>Mourinho made some questionable decisions as Manchester United manager, but he can be commended for the faith he showed in midfielder Scott McTominay.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was the man who handed him his debut at the end of the 2016/17 season, and called upon him regularly over the next couple of years.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international’s rise at Old Trafford has been impressive, and he is now a regular in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team and very popular with the fans.</p>
      <p>Skipp will see no reason why he can’t become Mourinho’s next McTominay.</p>
