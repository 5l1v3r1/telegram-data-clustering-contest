      <p>The Government Vellore Medical College Hospital is observing ‘Newborn Baby Week’ to promote better health care among infants.</p>
      <p>S. Gopaul, former director of Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children, Egmore, in his address to the participants said that in India the infant mortality rate was high 50 years ago, particularly with regard to neonatal mortality.</p>
      <p>The situation at present was a vast improvement, with infant mortality rate coming down after the Health department took steps to combat lack of nutrition, birth deficiency and poor medical facilities.</p>
      <p>Dr. Gopaul said in the last 30 years, the Central and State governments, along with medical colleges, have been creating awareness about the need to ensure institutional delivery and avoid delivery of babies at home.</p>
      <p>He said that pregnant women giving birth to babies at home have been doing so with the assistance of experienced nurses only.</p>
      <p>He added that a committee formed by the Health department does a death audit, or conducts a study of the reasons for the death of each newborn baby in the State, and advises necessary preventive steps along with promoting breastfeeding of mothers by celebrating Breastfeeding week and Newborn Baby week.</p>
      <p>Congratulating the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital for organising such functions, Dr. Gopaul said such functions help in sharing knowledge to practising medical specialists and nurses.</p>
      <p>He lauded the hospital for having the best health facilities for newborn babies in the State.</p>
      <p>A quiz programme was also held for the doctors and nurses. Government Vellore Medical College Hospital Dean R. Selvi and Head of Department of Paediatrics A. Theranirajan participated.</p>
      <p>Newborn Baby Week is observed from November 15 to 21.</p>
