      <h1>Church builds huge baby Jesus statue — that looks like Phil Collins</h1>

      <p>Is this Jesus’ Genesis?</p>
      <p>A Mexican church claims it has “accidentally” erected the largest baby Jesus statue in the world. Also an accident: the statue’s uncanny resemblance to British singer Phil Collins.</p>
      <p>The nearly 22-foot-tall, 2,000-pound giant traveled 12 hours from the city of Chimalhuacán, where it was built for the La EpifanÍa del Señor church in the central Mexican state of Zacatecas, where it now resides.</p>
      <p>The Rev. Humberto Rodriguez tells Central European News he only meant to commission a statue that would “fit the church,” but in so doing, he may have created the biggest Jesus/Phil lookalike on the planet.</p>
      <p>“There is a space of between 26 feet between the ceiling and the floor and I ordered a statue measuring 21 feet, but I never intended to make it the biggest baby Jesus statue in the world,” he says.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez had nothing to say about the statue’s resemblance to Collins, the Genesis frontman and drummer who sported a similar front hair tuft in the mid-1980s.</p>
      <p>Today, the 68-year-old “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-rfCnW5VlE">Jesus He Knows Me</a>” singer no longer rocks a tuft — or any head hair at all. He does, however, still have those big baby blues.</p>
      <p>Collins’ reps did not immediately reply to The Post’s request for comment about this massive — albeit accidental — honor.</p>
      <p>Sculptor Roman Salvador says his artwork is made of fiberglass, resin, automotive paste and automotive paint.</p>
      <p>Upon its completion, the church began investigating the sizes of other baby Jesus statues around the world and found that the previous record-holder was just 16 feet tall and 661 pounds.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez says he’s contacted Guinness World Records to confirm their new, inadvertent record-beater.</p>
      <p>If the submission is approved, La EpifanÍa del Señor will be the first title-holder for “largest baby Jesus statue,” Guinness tells The Post in an email.</p>
      <p>The Guinness record-holder for tallest statue of Jesus Christ is ”Christ the King.” It measures 120 feet tall and is located in Swiebodzin, Poland. It was completed on Nov. 6, 2010.</p>
      <p>BTW: Brazil is also home to a shockingly large grown-up Jesus statue. Constructed over the course of a decade and completed in 1931, Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer stands 98 feet high, his arms stretching 92 feet across.</p>
      <p>Eureka Springs, Arkansas, and Lux Mundi, Ohio, are home to the biggest Jesus figures in the United States. Arkansas’ Christ of the Ozarks measures 66 feet tall, and Ohio’s King of Kings stands at 62 feet.</p>
