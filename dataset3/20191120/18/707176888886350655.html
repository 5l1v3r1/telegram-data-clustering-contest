      <h1>GM sues Fiat Chrysler over alleged union bribes</h1>
      <h2>US carmaker says rival obtained unfair advantages by bribing UAW officials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:53:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Campbell</a></address>
      <p>General Motors has claimed it was forced to pay billions of dollars in higher wages and other workforce costs after bargaining talks were corrupted by bribes paid to union leaders by its rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</p>
      <p>In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, GM said its rival carmaker had obtained unfair advantages by bribing officials of the UAW union. The illegal behaviour of its Detroit rival left GM at a disadvantage, the carmaker said.</p>
      <p>Part of the aim was to weaken GM over time, in order to make an eventual merger with FCA more likely, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit names Sergio Marchionne, the former FCA chief executive who died last year, as a central figure of the scheme, but also names FCA as a defendant, as well as several FCA executives.</p>
      <p>The UAW, which represents auto workers in the US, has been investigated since 2017 over corruption that saw some of its leaders accepting bribes from FCA.</p>
      <p>Three FCA officials and four former UAW officials have pleaded guilty to operating a long-running bribery scheme, following an investigation by the US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. One former FCA executive, Alphons Iacobelli, who was the former lead negotiator, is serving a prison sentence following the probe.</p>
      <blockquote>We intend to vigorously defend against this meritless lawsuit and pursue all legal remedies in response to it<cite>FCA spokesman</cite></blockquote>
      <p>GM’s lawsuit comes at a delicate time for FCA, which is in negotiations with UAW over the latest pay deals and is also attempting to push through a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11e7b5c8-fbab-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">merger with PSA</a> of France to create the world’s fourth-largest carmaker. If successful, the deal would see FCA and its combined French partner overtake GM in global scale.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for FCA said: “We are astonished by this filing, both its content and its timing. We can only assume this was intended to disrupt our proposed merger with PSA as well as our negotiations with the UAW. We intend to vigorously defend against this meritless lawsuit and pursue all legal remedies in response to it.”</p>
      <p>Last month, GM workers ended a 40-day strike over the latest round of four-year pay negotiations with the UAW. Ford has finished negotiations with the UAW, while FCA is still in talks.</p>
      <p>Two rounds of pay negotiations — in 2011 and 2015 — happened while the bribery was going on, the lawsuit states, while GM’s costs were also affected from 2009.</p>
      <p>GM alleges that Mr Marchionne, who had several merger offers to GM rebuffed in 2015, was “central” to the scheme.</p>
      <p>The skewed deal with FCA led to GM facing “massive monetary damage in the form of higher costs,” the lawsuit states.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit claims that FCA “embarked on a systemic and near decade-long conspiracy to bribe senior union officials to corrupt the collective bargaining process and labor relations.”</p>
      <p>The bribery ran into the millions of dollars and took several forms, the lawsuit states, citing the earlier investigation.</p>
      <p>This included letting UAW officials use credit cards to pay for Louboutin shoes, Disney World theme park tickets and in one case a Beretta shotgun that were ultimately paid for by FCA.</p>
      <p>It also included setting up front companies that received large payments, including a photography business that received $70,000 allegedly to give photography classes to underprivileged children.</p>
      <p>The business “only taught a handful of classes, cancelled most of them, and then spent the money on fancy clothes, nightclubs, and restaurants,” the lawsuit states.</p>
      <p>Craig Glidden, general counsel at GM, said: “This lawsuit is intended to hold FCA accountable for the harm its actions have caused our company and to ensure a level playing field going forward.”</p>
