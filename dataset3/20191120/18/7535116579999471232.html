      <p>If you had the kind of parents who threatened to disown you if your report card had anything but an A on it, youâ€™ll relate to this story from <a href="https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2149604.html">Sin Chew Daily</a> a little too well. After all, thereâ€™s a reason why weâ€™re called <b>A</b>sians.</p>
      <p>Recently, two Standard 6 boys from Suzhou, China, were caught after running away from home because they were worried about scoring <b>less than 90% on their exams!</b></p>

      <p>The boys allegedly took the school test yesterday and<i> knew</i> they wouldnâ€™t score the grades their parents expected them to get. Out of fear, they didnâ€™t dare go home.</p>
      <p>Late last night, authorities were alerted to the missing boys when their concerned mothers launched police reports about their sons who had not returned from school that day.</p>
      <p>The police immediately looked through surveillance footage that revealed the children walking past the school and into a residential community at around midnight. Thankfully, they managed to find the kids at the corridor of the community gate an hour later.</p>

      <p>Upon further investigation, it was revealed that both parents had high expectations for their kids and <b>refused to accept anything less than 90%</b>. However, when they took the test, the kids mutually agreed that they didnâ€™t perform to the standard that was required of them and hence decided that going home was <i>not an option</i>.</p>

      <p>Once the police contacted the parents to pick up their missing kids, they also advised them not to put so much pressure on their children and to adjust their disciplinary methods.</p>

        <i>This is truly pushing the limits of kiasu parenting. What do you guys think?</i>
