        <b><a href="https://www.legit.ng/1274925-cristiano-ronaldo-escape-heavy-fine-insulting-juventus-boss-sarri.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> could be leaving Italian champions Juventus for a sensational return to Premier League club Manchester United if the Old Lady fail to win Champions League title.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spanish panelist Eduardo Inda made the claim that Ronaldo will not play for the Turin based club next term if they should fail to win Champions League this season.</p>
      <p>And Old Trafford is reported to be his likely destination as he could rejoin the club where he made his name in football.</p>
      <p>His future at Juventus looks uncertain after his reported fallout with Old Lady manager Maurizio Sarri.</p>

      <p>The former Real Madrid star was substituted by Maurizio Sarri which made Ronaldo livid while leaving the pitch.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri claimed that he took off Cristiano Ronaldo because he was injured, but the Portuguese countered the claims afterwards.</p>
