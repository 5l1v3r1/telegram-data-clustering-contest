      <p>Spotify today made its free service even more attractive for users in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. For the first time, Spotify free tier users can now stream music to smart speakers from Amazon, Sonos, and Bose. For example, you can now ask Alexa to play Today’s Top Hits even when you don’t have Spotify Premium subscription. Similarly, through Spotify Connect, Sonos and Bose speakers can now play Spotify free music content.</p>
      <p>“Incorporating Spotify into these devices is all part of our goal to create a truly frictionless experience for our users. Play from your phone, transition to your smart speaker, back to the phone, over to the car—with just a tap or the sound of your voice,” Spotify mentioned in its blog post.</p>
