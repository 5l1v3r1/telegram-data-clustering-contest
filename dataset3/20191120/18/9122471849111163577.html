      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Iowa vs. Illinois</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:18:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Kinnick Stadium has been a nightmare for top teams in recent seasons. That continued last weekend, with Iowa’s win over previously undefeated Minnesota. The Hawkeyes need to avoid a letdown spot on Saturday, with a surprising Illinoi squad coming to Iowa City.</p>
      <p>The Fighting Illini are just one game worse than the Hawkeyes in the record books, and have the same 4-3 mark in Big Ten play. Starting with their <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/wisconsin-loses-to-illinois-shocker-2019">shocking win over Wisconsin</a>, Lovie Smith’s team has ripped off four straight win, beating Michigan State last weekend to clinch bowl eligibility.</p>
      <p>Even with Illinois’ hot streak, Iowa enters as a big favorite. The current line is hovering around Iowa -15.5 or -16, depending on the sportsbook.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Bill Connelly, creator of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28099946/sp+-rankings-week-12-battle-1-loss-teams">SP+ ratings system</a>, has logged its Week 4 picks and score projections. The system basically has that line right on the money.</p>

      <p>SP+ gives Iowa a projected win margin of 15.3, and rounds the score to 33-17 in favor of the Hawkeyes. That rounded score would be a push at a spread of 16, while the more precise margin is slightly in favor of Illinois, though there’s little room for error there.</p>
      <p>The total points over/under is set at 47. SP+ likes the over on that bet.</p>
      <p>The Hawkeyes have struggling Nebraska to end the season, while Illinois finishes the year with a two-win Northwestern team, so both have the opportunity to finish up with two wins here.</p>
