      <h1>BTS didn't receive single nomination at the Grammys; Hasley says the K-Pop band deserved many</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:15:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Everyone was expecting <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hasley">Hasley</a>'s song '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Without-Me">Without Me</a>' to be a frontrunner at the Grammy 2020. However, the pop singer didn't receive any appreciation for the ceremony. After the nomination list dropped over the internet on November 20, fans of the singer were quick to notice that Hasley's 'Without Me' was missing.</p>
      <p>For the unversed, 'Without Me' was Halsey's first Billboard Hot 100 no. 1 song as a lead artist!</p>
      <p>Hasley took to her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> to express her feelings and also wrote that Korean boy band <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/BTS">BTS</a> also deserved many nominations. She tweeted, "deleting and ignoring all negativity. BTS deserved many nominations. I am however, unsurprised that they werenâ€™t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come."</p>
