      <p>Wild elephant Arisi Raja, which was captured from Arthanaripalayam near Pollachi on November 14, has started accepting hand-fed food in captivity, said a senior official of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR).</p>
      <p>A.S. Marimuthu, Deputy Field Director of ATR and District Forest Officer of Pollachi Forest Division, told <i>The Hindu</i> on Wednesday that the elephant, aged around 20, started accepting hand-fed food from the fifth day in the kraal (wooden enclosure) at Varagaliar near Topslip.</p>
      <p>“The elephant was naturally aggressive in the first two-three days in the kraal. Now it is accepting hand-fed food like sugarcane and forest fodder from trainers. Accepting hand-fed food means that the elephant is getting accustomed to the new environment,” said Mr. Marimuthu, who inspected the kraal at Varagaliar.</p>
      <p>Mr. Marimuth said the handlers assigned for the elephant have also started using basic commands to train the elephant.</p>
      <p>The mahout and kavadi (assistant to mahout) will condition the elephant to obey 48 basic commands and their combinations when it is kept in captivity.</p>
      <p>According to the official, forest veterinary officers are constantly monitoring the elephant and its health.</p>
      <p>The elephant's diet in the kraal includes boiled rice, ragi, jaggery, sugarcane, coconut, fruits, salt, health supplements, plenty of forest fodder and water.</p>
      <p>The elephant got the name “Arisi Raja” for its habit of stealing rice from houses and shops, before it was captured.</p>
