      <p>Last year’s <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/10/29/oneplus-6t-review/">OnePlus 6T</a>, which is also a really quick phone, is also getting a $200 discount, making it cost $600 in Canada. This device also comes with a free case.</p>
      <p>Beyond the two phone deals, the manufacturer is also taking down the price on cases, chargers, and other accessories to celebrate the shopping event.</p>
      <p>You can check out the prices on <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=320330&amp;mid=10855&amp;awinaffid=597253&amp;linkid=2023646&amp;clickref=">the company’s deal page. </a></p>
