      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>An Accountability Court (AC) on Wednesday adjourned the hearing of a corruption reference against former finance minister Ishaq Dar and other co-accused till November 27 pertaining to assets beyond known sources of income.</p>
      <p>The defence counsel would continue cross-examination with National Accountability Bureau (NAB’s) investigation officer (IO) Nadir Abbas on the next hearing.</p>
      <p>AC-I Judge Muhammad Bashir conducted hearing of the case filed by the anti-graft buster.</p>
      <p>Co-accused former National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) president Saeed Ahmed had filed an application seeking one-day exemption from the hearing which was accepted by the judge.</p>
      <p>NAB IO and last prosecution witness Nadir Abbas pleaded that the connection of co-accused with the foreign assets of Dar could not be proved so far.</p>
      <p>He said that there was no connection of accused Mansoor Raza and Naeem Mehmood with Dar’s bank accounts mentioned in the interim reference.</p>

      <p>Defence lawyer Qazi Misbah asked whether the person in whose account an amount of $2million was transferred in 1995 investigated.<br/>Abbas replied that it was not part of his investigation but was the record of joint investigation team (JIT).</p>
      <p>NAB prosecutor Afzal Qureshi objected over the defence queries stating how the counsel of a co-accused could inquire about the former finance minister who had been declared proclaimed offender.</p>
      <p>He said that Dar had not even hired lawyer for his defence.<br/>The investigation officer denied any relation of the co-accused Mehmood and Raza with the accounts and finding of record against Raza in JIT record.</p>
      <p>Objecting to the NAB record, the defence lawyer asked for the record of accounts’ transactions to be presented in the court.</p>
      <p>The court directed the investigating officer to present the record in the next hearing and adjourned the case till November 27.</p>
