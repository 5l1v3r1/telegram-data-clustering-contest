        <b>When you first think of Laura Dern and Carrie Fisher, you wouldn’t think the two had much in common with each other.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, the two can relate more than one may think as they both grew up in famous families.</p>
      <p>Laura learned everything she knows about acting from her mother Diane Ladd who starred in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore while Carrie’s mother was Singing in the Rain star Debbie Reynolds.</p>
      <p>Not enough for you?</p>
      <p>Both of these actresses also had famous but less involved fathers.</p>
      <p>The singer Eddie Fisher was Carrie’s father, and the actress even revealed he had an affair with Princess Margaret.</p>
      <p>Laura’s father, on the other hand, is Nebraska actor Bruce Dern.</p>
      <p>Carrie had been a loud comedian who wasn’t afraid to bring humour to uncomfortable situations, the same with Laura.</p>
      <p>She once said she enjoyed finding ‘humour in broken places’, which was what Carrie was great at.</p>

      <p>The late actress wrote books that used comedy to explore the sexual harassment that is so prevalent in Hollywood.</p>

      <p>She also used to write about her struggles with addiction and mental health issues, both topics she’s been very open about.</p>
      <p>The two talented actresses got to work together on Star Wars: The Last Jedi before Carrie died in 2016.</p>
      <p>Carrie, of course, reprised her role as Leia Organa while Dern played Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a female rebel leader.</p>
      <p>In the movie, the Admiral and Leia had a complicated relationship as they were lifelong friends since before the events of The Last Jedi.</p>
      <p>On working with the original Star Wars actress, Laura said: ‘She has always been one of the most extraordinary beacons, an original screen icon.’</p>
