      <p>The Queen has given permission for Prince Andrew to ‘step back from public duties for the foreseeable future’ amid criticism over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York said in a statement that it was ‘clear’ his association with the billionaire paedophile was causing ‘disruption to my family’s work’.</p>
      <p>He wrote to Her Majesty asking to take a step back from his work as a Royal.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York also said he was ‘willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required’ over the Epstein probe.</p>
