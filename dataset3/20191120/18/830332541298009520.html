      <p>Some children ask for the usual gifts for Christmas, the latest gadget or toy, or sometimes a new puppy or kitten.</p>
      <p>One Los Angeles 10-year-old, though, went all out with her wishlist —  to the tune of about $10,000.</p>
      <p>Her hopefulness warranted <a href="https://twitter.com/a_johnson412/status/1194689352992903169">a now-viral Twitter post</a> by her father, and the internet responded as the internet tends to do.</p>
      <p>"My 10 year old daughter must be out of her mind with this Christmas list," posted @a_johnson412 on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>The awe-inspiring list included items you might expect a child to ask for, but perhaps on a less expensive scale. Among them were an iPhone 11, Air Pods, a new MacBook Air, a real bunny (and clothes for the bunny), Gucci slides and a Chanel purse. (See the full list below.)</p>
      <p>The little fashionista also asked for $4,000, likely to pick up whatever Santa failed to leave.</p>
      <p>The Twitter post, which has 25,000 retweets and over 125,000 likes, led to the internet responding with humor.</p>
      <p>"Sneaking in that 4K at the bottom is a rockstar move," wrote @R_Lehmeier.</p>
      <p>"She has some reasonable things as well. An alarm clock, new sheets (responsibility and comfort) and dolls (she's still your little girl). American girl is reasonable and clothes. At least she cant say you didnt pick from her list," responded @DClutterstuff.</p>
      <p>Another parent, @SparkSeekerrr, commiserated with the original poster: "My daughter and your daughter must know each other. Just yesterday she told me Santa was going to bring her a Gucci backpack, new bedroom set, iPhone 11 and a kitten."</p>
      <p>We can only hope that whatever @a_johnson412's daughter finds under the tree, her dad returns to tell the internet all about it.</p>
