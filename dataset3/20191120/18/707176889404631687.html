      <h2>Moves comes as Trump administration struggles to reach truce in trade war</h2>

      <p>The Trump administration has approved “several” individual licences for US companies to do business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, as it seeks to cushion the impact of an export ban introduced this year that has soured trade relations between Washington and Beijing.</p>
      <p>The US commerce department announced the move in a statement on Wednesday, as officials from the world’s two largest economies struggled to reach a limited truce in their trade war that would avoid a new escalation in tariffs in the middle of next month.</p>
      <p>“The Department is issuing these narrow licences to authorise limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,” it said.</p>
      <p>The commerce department said the green light had been given after an inter-agency review including representatives of the US state department, US defence department, and US energy department, without naming any of the companies involved. It pointed out that it would also be denying some individual licences to sell to Huawei.</p>
      <p>The export ban imposed on US sales to Huawei took effect in May following accusations that the company could be a vehicle for espionage on behalf of the Chinese government and military.</p>
      <p>It has been a sore point between Washington and Beijing, coming on top of the Trump administration’s diplomatic <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2927883a-0b8c-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">campaign</a> to prevent countries around the world from using Huawei to build out their 5G networks. It also caused a backlash among US technology groups with ties to Huawei, which mounted an aggressive lobbying campaign to persuade the Trump administration to relax the ban.</p>
      <p>The US commerce department quickly approved a temporary general licence allowing some transactions with Huawei, mostly involving US rural telecommunications carriers, which was extended for three more months this week.</p>
      <p>But the fate of a crop of individual licences to sell to Huawei — offering more certainty to the affected companies — has been up in the air, since Washington had not made any decision on those nearly 300 applications until now.</p>
      <p>John Neuffer, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said he was pleased with the move. “Sales of these non-sensitive commercial products help ensure the competitiveness of the US semiconductor industry, which is essential to national security,” he said. “We hope licence approvals continue to proceed in an appropriate and timely manner.”</p>
      <p>Although the Trump administration has faced pressure from business to relax the Huawei export ban, the move could face resistance from China hawks in Washington who have long argued that the US should take an even tougher line towards the Chinese group and the White House should not use it as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. </p>

      <p>The commerce department’s move on Huawei comes as the US and China failed to meet their own goal of agreeing to a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/07c0d99c-0706-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">“phase one” trade truce</a> by the middle of this month, amid persistent disagreements over tariff relief and the limited concessions on structural economic issues coming from Beijing.</p>
      <p>If no agreement is reached by December 15, the US will impose tariffs on a further $156bn of Chinese imports at a level of 15 per cent, further exacerbating the economic conflict.</p>
      <p>The prospects of a deal were further clouded during the political crisis in Hong Kong, and the subsequent move this week by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a859e138-0b24-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">US Senate</a> to express its support for the protesters. As he headed to Texas on Wednesday to visit an Apple manufacturing plant, Mr Trump betrayed no concern that the trade talks might collapse. </p>
      <p>“We continue to talk to China. China wants to make a deal,” Mr Trump said. “The question is: Do I want to make a deal? Because I like what's happening right now. We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars,” he added. </p>
