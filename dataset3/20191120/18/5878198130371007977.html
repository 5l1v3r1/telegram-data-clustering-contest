      <p>A Report on international education shows that there is an overall increase in the number of African students in United State education institutions.</p>
      <p>The 2019 <a href="https://www.iie.org/opendoors">Open Doors Annual Data</a> released in Washington, D.C. at the U.S. Institute of Peace provides a wealth of information and data on the numbers of international students studying in the United States in the 2018/19 academic year.</p>
      <p>It said the United States hosted nearly 1.2 million international students during the 2018/2019 academic year and the number of Sub-Saharan African students hit a record high at 40,290, marking a 2.1 per cent increase over the previous year.</p>
      <p>This makes Africa the only region of the world with the highest percentage of growth for the second time in a row. The giants of West Africa, Nigeria and Ghana, made an overwhelming contribution to the growth in the region.</p>
      <p>Around 500 institutions participate in this survey, a subset of the more than 2,800 institutions surveyed for Open Doors and here are the top five African countries with the highest number of students in American schools.</p>
