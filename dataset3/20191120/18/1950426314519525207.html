        <b>A student at a high school in Illinois voiced her opposition to a new transgender policy that allows male students to change in the girls’ locker room.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Students had mixed reactions following the Palatine-Shaumburg District 211 school board’s 5-2 decision last Thursday to pass the policy, which grants transgender students “unrestricted” locker room access.</p>

      <p>“I feel uncomfortable. My privacy’s being invaded,” Fremd High School student athlete Julia Burca stated in an interview following the vote.</p>
      <p>“As a swimmer, I change multiple times, naked, in front of the other students in the locker room,” Burca said.</p>
      <p>“I feel very uncomfortable and I feel it’s against my rights as a student,” Burca <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/education/palatine-school-board-votes-to-give-transgender-students-unrestricted-access-to-locker-rooms/5698527/">said</a> in another interview.</p>
      <p>Another female student interviewed by ABC 7 Chicago related, “I do not want to see a transgender student naked in the locker rooms.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, purple-haired trans student Nova Maday was happy the policy was enacted, but says it didn’t go far enough.</p>
      <p>“I’m ecstatic,” Maday said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely a first step forward in many more steps. It’s a great policy. Unfortunately it’s not everything we want,” Maday stated.</p>
      <p>Maday was one of the students who filed a lawsuit against the district back in 2017 over locker room access, claiming his gender identity trumped natural biology.</p>
      <p>According to ABC 7, the board indicated that only students who’ve “officially identified” as a different gender will be allowed access to the locker room “that corresponds to their identity.”</p>
