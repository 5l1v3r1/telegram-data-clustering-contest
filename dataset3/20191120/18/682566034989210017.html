      <p>Cape Town - <b>Mercedes'</b> <b>Lewis Hamilton</b> says it is an honour to hear English fans call for his knighthood, but insists he does not expect to receive the honour.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, who has already received an MBE from the Queen, is without a doubt Britain's most successful Formula 1 driver.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month he wrapped up his sixth Drivers' Championship, putting him just one away from equalling Michael Schumacher's all-time record.</p>
      <p>His success has led to calls from the likes of Motorsport UK chairman David Richards for the 34-year-old to be knighted.</p>
      <p>Hamilton has downplayed the hoohah.</p>
      <p>"I don't really like to think too much about it," he said.</p>
      <p>"Just the fact that people have mentioned it, it's already an honour, but it's not been something that I've been chasing in my life.</p>
      <p>"If, at any point, that was to happen, I don't particularly know how I would handle it.</p>
      <p>"I have stood in front of Her Majesty The Queen before and it was pretty incredible and I think she's just awesome.</p>
      <p>"Again, I don't think it's going to happen, and again, it doesn't bother me if it doesn't.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't mean I'm not British.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't mean I'm not continuing to try and raise the flag as well as I can but I do appreciate all the support I've had from my fans and also from the British media."</p>
      <p>Pressed as to why he didn't think it would ever happen, he replied: "I don't know, I just don't think about it. I don't know."</p>
      <p>Although Hamilton is arguably one of the UK's most successful sportspeople, his team boss Toto Wolff feels he doesn't receive the appreciation that his success deserves.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult for me, as an Austrian, to understand the importance of the British honours system," Wolff toldÂ <i>The Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>"What I feel is that there is a lot of polarisation around Lewis, particularly in the UK. Why that is, I don't know.</p>
      <p>"But one thing I'm certain of is that one day, if he decides to stop his career, people will acknowledge his successes and what a great superstar he was."</p>
