      <h1>Grammy Awards snubs include Taylor Swift, Maren Morris</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:15:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Sahadeo</a></address>
      <p>The nominees for the 62nd annual <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/grammys">Grammy Awards</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2020-grammy-nominations-lizzo-scores-most-nominations-beside-artists-like-lil-nas-x-and-billie-eilish">were unveiled on Wednesday</a> and featured new faces such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lizzo-ariana-grande-good-as-hell-collaboration-remix">Lizzo</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/old-town-road-rapper-lil-nas-x-appears-to-come-out-during-pride-month">Lil Nas X</a> — but the list also contained a number of notable omissions.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest snubs for the 2020 Grammys is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a>’s “Lover,” which missed out on the nomination for album of the year. “Lover” features production from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lena-dunham-and-longtime-boyfriend-jack-antonoff-reportedly-break-up">Jack Antonoff</a>, who received a nomination for producer of the year.</p>
      <p>Although Swift received nominations for best pop vocal album, best pop solo performance and song of the year, her album of the year snub comes as a shock considering that Swift was the first female artist to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seamuskirst/2016/02/16/taylor-swift-is-first-woman-to-win-album-of-the-year-twice-her-team-is-disproportionately-male/#6f3d205277c3">win album of the year twice</a> for albums “1989” and “Fearless.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nick-jonas-groped-concert">The Jonas Brothers</a>, who recently made their resurgence after a six-year hiatus, received their first Grammy nomination in 10 years. The group received the nomination for best pop duo/group performance for “Sucker,” but failed to receive nominations in major categories such as record of the year, album of the year and song of the year.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ed-sheeran-anxiety">Ed Sheeran</a> was also snubbed for album of the year. His album “No.6 Collaborations Project” debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and features a range of guest appearances from artists such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/travis-scott-be-safe-rage-hard-fans-injured-astroworld-festival">Travis Scott</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/eminem-interviewed-by-the-secret-service-over-threatening-lyrics-aimed-at-trump-documents-show">Eminem</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cardi-b">Cardi B</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/50-cent-nancy-pelosi-capitol-hill">50 Cent</a>.</p>
      <p>Another Grammy snub comes in the form of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-friendship">Shawn Mendes</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-romance-began">Camila Cabello</a>’s “Senorita.” Though the song received the nomination for best pop duo/group performance, the hit single did not receive the nomination for song of the year considering its vast popularity.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, “Senorita” currently has 982 million listens on Spotify.</p>
