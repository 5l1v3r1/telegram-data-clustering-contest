      <p>While never specifically mentioning the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2021-hyundai-tucson-corners-flat-at-nurburgring-has-cayenne-taillights-138559.html">Tucson</a>, the concept hints at its name and the grille+headlight combo is basically unmistakable at this point. Hyundai even goes as far as to give us some specs, though nothing about the engine itself.</p>
      <p>The Vision T measures 181.5 inches (4,610 mm) long, 79.3 inches (1,938 mm) wide, stands 67.1 inches (1,704 mm) tall, and has a 110.4-inch (2,804 mm) long wheelbase. These very specific numbers are likely to translate into a chunky crossover, which would be about 5 inches longer than before, as well as much wider. We like these changes, especially as Hyundai now makes a variety of slightly smaller vehicles.</p>
      <p>“We pursue innovative solutions in design and add emotional value to our product experience through sensuous sportiness design language,” said the automaker’s senior VP and head of global design, SangYup Lee.</p>
      <p>The Vision T is said to have a plug-in powertrain, which is not surprising, considering even the smaller Kona has a <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/p.html#ge-plug-in-hybrid-electric-vehicle"><u>PHEV</u></a> system. Alongside this, Hyundai will offer a hybrid drive too, just like on the Sonata. But the bulk of sales will still come from engines which area already available.</p>
      <p>In America, that means a 2.5-liter Theta3, packing about 180-190 horsepower. Rumors talk about an N performance version with a turbocharger strapped onto it, but we haven't seen any such prototypes yet. Europe, meanwhile, will buy those hybrids, together with the 1.6 T-GDI turbo and perhaps a diesel or two.</p>
      <p>The debut of the 2021 Tucson is likely to take place in Spring 2020. For now, let's just enjoy the beauty of that jewel-like grille design. Tell us which brand you think inspired this concept the most. Maybe it's got Lexus concept wheels or <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-toyota-rav4-is-less-comfortable-than-mazda-cx-5-says-consumer-reports-133379.html">Toyota RAV4</a> fenders. 🏁</p>
