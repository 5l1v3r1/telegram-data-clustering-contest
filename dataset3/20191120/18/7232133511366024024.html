      <h1>Annual XRP Swell Pump Amounts To Bearish Ripple Retest</h1>

      <p>Each year, the annual <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ripple">Ripple</a>-hosted Swell conference causes a strong XRP price pump leading up to the event, but the asset typically corrects in a post-event sell-off back to normal price ranges.</p>
      <p>This year, the pump was underwhelming, and according to one crypto analyst, has amounted to nothing more than a bearish retest that was rejected, signaling that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/xrp">XRP</a> may have a lot further to fall.</p>
      <h3>Swell-Driven XRP Pump Results in Bearish Retest and Rejection</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ripple">Ripple</a>’s annual conference acts as a gathering of the finest minds in the finance sector and payments space, putting a central focus on the company’s many products and services, as well as Ripple protocol’s native cryptocurrency token, XRP.</p>

      <p>In past years, it’s acted as a stage for big names like former United States President Bill Clinton, former Fed Chairman Dr. Ben Bernanke, and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, often considered to be the inventor of the world wide web.</p>
      <p>With so much news and buzz expected from the event, investors begin loading up on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/xrp">XRP</a> in advance of each year’s Swell, causing the price of the asset to swell, as well. This year was no different, and the price of XRP rose from a<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/09/25/xrp-breaks-below-bear-market-bottom-will-the-rest-of-crypto-follow/"> fresh bear market low at 21 cents per XRP</a>, to as high as 31 cents before the asset was rejected and a sell-off began.</p>

      <p>The resulting Swell pump and following rejection, according to one crypto analyst was nothing more than a bearish retest of former diagonal support turned resistance. And now that the asset has been rejected from key resistance on high timeframes, XRP is at risk of falling much further.</p>

      <h3>Ripple Rejection Coincides With Long-Term Moving Averages, Is 1 Cent Ripple Ahead?</h3>
      <p>Interestingly, the diagonal support where the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ripple">Ripple</a> Swell pump was rejected from also coincided with a retest of both the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XRPUSD/YlDIxTx4-XRP-Bearish-Retest-Rejected-Could-Ripple-Fall-Below-a-Penny/">50-week and 200-week moving averages</a>. XRP was unable to close a weekly candle above either of the key moving averages, and it could signal that another massive decline is coming.</p>

      <p>Below current price levels, horizontal support lies at roughly 14 cents per XRP – a support level dating back to the 2017 crypto bull market. If support there cannot hold, a far deeper drop would be possible, one that would take the price per XRP to as low as 3 cents per XRP.</p>

      <p>Long-term support lies back as low as one cent or lower per <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/xrp">XRP</a>, which would take Ripple back to pre-crypto bubble prices. However, such a drop would represent another 90+ percent fall from current prices – and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/11/list-of-crypto-all-time-high-prices-shows-how-far-market-must-recover/">Ripple is already down over  90% from its all-time high price of $3.80</a>.</p>
