      <p>LONDON: Jose Mourinho has been appointed as the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by the Premier League club on Tuesday.<br/><br/>The former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United manager signed a contract with the London club until the end of the 2022-2023 season.<br/><br/>Mourinho said: "I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."<br/><br/>Mourinho won the UEFA Champions League with both FC Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010. The 56-years-old Portuguese is also a three-time Premier League champion with Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Tottenham's chairman Daniel Levy said: "In Jose, we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honors at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room."<br/><br/>Mourinho was dismissed by Manchester United in December 2018, midway through his third season at the club.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pochettino, 47, joined Spurs in 2014. The Argentine led the team to reach the final of the UEFA Champions League last season but disappointed the board as Spurs are currently ranked 14th in the Premier League. They also suffered a humiliating 7-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the group stage at Champions League.</p>
