      <p>In late October, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/28/apple-releases-ios-13-2/">Apple released</a> <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.co/tag/ios-13/">iOS 13.2</a> and iPadOS 13.2 to the public. Now the company is looking ahead to the mobile operating system’s next minor update.</p>
      <p>Apple on Wednesday seeded the third betas of iOS 13.3 and iPadOS 13.3 to developers. Apple has been updating its latest major version of its mobile operating system on a semi-regular basis since its public launch earlier this year, and that trend continues with iOS 13.3 on the horizon. We already know that this newest version offers some new features, and it will also be improving the overall performance and squashing bugs.</p>
      <p>For devs to update their devices, they will need to make sure they are properly registered and have the correct configuration profile installed. The new software can be downloaded and installed from Apple’s developer portal.</p>
      <p>Looking back, the public launch of iOS 13.2 brought with it quite a few new features. That includes Deep Fusion for even better photographs taken with the iPhone 11/iPhone 11 Pro’s camera(s), more than 70 new emoji options, and more. You can check out all of the new things in iOS 13.2 <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/29/ios-13-2-features-tutorial/">right here</a>.</p>
      <p>As far as what’s new in this latest beta, that remains unclear. If any new major features are added to the mix, we will update this post accordingly.</p>
      <p>Apple did add new features and changes to a previous beta, though. <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/05/ios-13-3-includes-communication-limits-in-screen-time/">That includes</a> a brand new Communication Limits option in Screen Time. There is an updated Apple Watch icon, and an easier way to disable the Memoji options from always popping up in the keyboard.</p>
      <p>Apple also seeded the third beta of tvOS 13.3 to developers as well.</p>
      <p>Finally, Apple seeded the third beta of watchOS 61.1.1 to developers. To update the Apple Watch to the latest beta, the smartwatch must have at least 50% battery life, be connected to its charger, and also be within range and connected to the iPhone.</p>
      <p>The third developer betas of iOS 13.3, iPadOS 13.3, tvOS 13.3, and watchOS 6.1.1 are available now.</p>
