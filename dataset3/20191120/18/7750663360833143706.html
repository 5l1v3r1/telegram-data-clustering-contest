      <p>Having helped his country qualify for next summer's Finals, Bale was given a national flag which included the words 'Wales. Golf. Madrid', which plays up to a suggestion in the press that the forward has regularly played golf during his stint in Spain.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>ESPN</i>, Real officials have been left angry with Bale, with it being claimed that they regarded the actions as 'a joke in very bad taste'.</p>
      <p>Despite having over two-and-a-half years left on his contract, Bale has been heavily linked with an exit from the Bernabeu in one of the upcoming transfer windows.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that Real are increasingly open to parting ways with the 30-year-old in January.</p>
