      <h1>Arsenal fans react as Everton star Alex Iwobi posts Tweet after excellent international break</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:45:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Alex Iwobi helped Nigeria get their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign off to a flyer with two wins from two during the international brerak – and Arsenal fans have reacted to the Everton star’s Tweet.</p>
      <p>Nigeria took on Benin and Lesotho in a matter of days as they looked to take maximum points from their opening two games. Iwobi, 23, started and finished both matches as Nigeria did indeed win both matches – scoring six times in the process.</p>
      <p>Gernot Rohr’s side picked up a 2-1 win over Benin, before coming from behind to secure a 4-2 win over Lesotho. Iwobi scored Nigeria’s first, with an excellent first-time finish with his right foot from an acute angle.</p>
      <p>Iwobi, who was born in Nigeria but played for England’s youth setup until the Under-18 level before switching his allegiance to Nigeria – where the Everton star has since clocked up 40 caps for his country.</p>

      <p>Iwobi came through the Arsenal academy and after clocking up 149 appearances for the Gunners, he made a surprise deadline-day switch to Everton in the summer. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/08/08/everton-sign-alex-iwobi-for35m-butmarco-silvas-defence-still/">The Guardian claimed</a> Everton spent £35million to sign the versatile attacker.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans reacted to Iwobi’s Tweet after helping Nigeria pick up six points from their opening two matches, with many Gunners supporters urging the winger to return to The Emirates at some point in his career.</p>
