      <ul>
        <li>Blockchain card game Gods Unchained has registered a record number of transactions on the Ethereum ERC-721 standard.</li>
        <li>Despite eclipsing CryptoKitties transactions in a matter of days, Gods Unchained is not clogging up the blockchain.</li>
        <li>The Gods Unchained marketplace will soon go live and provide a useful test-case for the future of Ethereum gaming.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Crypto asset market research firm CoinMetrics has confirmed a huge spike in blockchain card trading over the last three days. The bulk of the transactions have come from the Hearthstone-inspired game <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a>.</p>
      <p>According to CoinMetrics, transactions in the Ethereum ERC-721 standard spiked 4x to record a staggering 3.7 million exchanges on Nov. 17.</p>
      <h3>What Is Gods Unchained &amp; ERC-721?</h3>
      <p>Gods Unchained is a decentralized digital card game that allows players to own cards and verify that ownership via a blockchain.</p>
      <p>All players receive a free set of untradable cards while rarer cards can be bought or earned through in-game play. Those cards can then be sold or traded on an Ethereum marketplace.</p>

      <p>Unlike traditional games, blockchain integration means you take complete ownership of your digital assets. In the old model you could potentially lose thousands of hours of in-game hustle if, for example, a publisher goes bust.</p>
      <p>Ethereums’s ERC-721 standard facilitates this. More commonly known as non-fungible tokens, NFTs differ from the more familiar ERC-20 standard which spawned the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/600-million-altcoin-bubble/">2017 altcoin euphoria</a>. NFTs in contrast are completely unique and specifically tied to an Ethereum owner’s wallet.</p>

      <h3>Ethereum Holding Strong in the Wake of the Transfers</h3>
      <p>Those who’ve been in the crypto space for a few years will remember another digital collectible phenomenon. In 2017, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/cryptokitties-reveals-ethereum-scalability-issues/">CryptoKitties stormed the Ethereum network while simultaneously revealing some major scalability issues</a>.</p>
      <p>Now thanks to efficient batching, Gods Unchained developer Immutable is proving that scalability is not the issue it once was.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/coinmetrics/status/1196894490340085761?s=20">CoinMetrics explains</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>For context, CryptoKitties has had about 4.7 million transfers over the course of its lifetime, which includes original purchases and secondary sales. @GodsUnchained has officially created over 6m tokenized in-game assets, which is more than any other Ethereum game to date.</blockquote>
      <p>Immutable has almost completed activating over <a href="https://godsunchained.info/">6 million Genesis season cards</a>, accounting for the ERC-721 spike mentioned earlier. Those numbers are insane for a three-day turnaround.</p>
      <p>The good news for Ethereum is, as CoinMetrics points out, that transactions remain “unclogged”, largely unaffecting transaction blocks since mid-October.</p>
      <h3>Marketplace Go Live</h3>
      <p>At 98% card activation, <a href="https://blog.godsunchained.com/2019/11/18/marketplace-preview/">the Gods Unchained marketplace is almost ready to go-live</a>. The following days should provide an interesting test-case for the effects of trading on the Ethereum network.</p>
      <p>In terms of the game’s rarest cards, Immutable plans to create a maximum of four titans every year known as the mythics. Two were already found in sold packs (with a one in a million odds) while one was auctionable.</p>
      <p>The auctionable card, known as the Hyperion, sold for a staggering $62,000 last year:</p>

      <p>Gods Unchained recently saw a huge uptake in players after its largest competitor <a href="https://www.ccn.com/blizzard-blitzchung-ban-u-turn-backlash/">Blizzard controversially banned a Hong Kong Hearthstone grandmaster</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear yet what kind of censorship Immutable will have over its own player base, however, providing its players with proper digital ownership is a great first step in disrupting the industry.</p>
