      <p>A mathematics teacher at the Panchayat Union Middle School at Alangariyur village in Ammapettai block in Bhavani Taluk was placed under suspension on Tuesday, after parents staged a protest accusing him of caning students.</p>
      <p>S. Selvaraj (35) of Bhavani worked as a BT Assistant in the school and handled Classes VII to VIII. It is alleged that Selvaraj caned 12 students of Class VII for not doing their homework. After the students started crying, people in the nearby area gathered at the school. The students complained to their parents, following which they were taken to a hospital. Later, the parents staged a protest demanding action against the teacher.</p>
      <p>Bhavani District Education Officer K. Palani and Ammapettai Police arrived at the school and held talks with the parents who wanted the teacher to be suspended. Later, the DEO held inquiries with the teacher and the headmaster and issued an order placing Mr. Selvaraj under suspension.</p>
