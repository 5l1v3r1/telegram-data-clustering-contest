      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson indicated that 2020 will be his last season in the NASCAR Cup Series.</p>
      <p>Johnson posted a video on Twitter Wednesday, expressing his gratitude for 18 “incredible” years of racing in NASCAR.</p>
      <p>Johnson, 44, has spent his entire career with the Hendrick Motorsports No. 48 Chevrolet operation, which he has called home since his premier series debut in 2001, NASCAR <a href="https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/11/20/jimmie-johnson-retire-2020-season-seven-time-champion-nascar/">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to next season, and celebrating what will be my last year as a full time NASCAR Cup driver,” Johnson said in a Twitter video.</p>

      <p>“This sport has been good to me, and has allowed me to do something I truly love," Johnson said in the video. "I showed up chasing a dream, and achieved more than I ever thought possible.”</p>
      <p>Johnson has won seven titles in NASCAR’s top division, tied for the most all-time with Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty, NASCAR reports. He ranks in a tie for sixth on NASCAR’s all-time win list.</p>
      <p>“Johnson emerged from the world of motorcycle racing and off-road trucks, moving to asphalt — first in the American Speed Association (ASA) circuit and eventually to a brief stint in what is now the NASCAR Xfinity Series,” <a href="https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/11/20/jimmie-johnson-retire-2020-season-seven-time-champion-nascar/">NASCAR reports</a>, “Once there, he caught the attention of four-time champion Jeff Gordon, thanks to a fortunate seating arrangement at a drivers’ meeting in 2000.”</p>
      <p>"NASCAR history will always hold Jimmie Johnson in the highest regard, for his hard-charging success on the racetrack and the way he conducted himself as a champion off the track. This remarkable seven-time champion – through his competitive spirit, immense talent and sportsmanship – has made NASCAR a better sport. On behalf of my family and the entire NASCAR community, I thank Jimmie for his dedication to NASCAR and, along with his legions of fans, wish him all the best in his final season. I look forward to watching him race for wins and an eighth NASCAR Cup Championship in 2020.” <br/>- Jim France, NASCAR Chairman and CEO</p>
      <p>“I know what this team is capable of and I hope 2020 is one of the best yet,” Johnson said.</p>
