      <p>Commuters sitting on platforms is a common sight at the municipal bus stand here as adequate chairs or benches are not present for them.</p>
      <p>Thousands of commuters from various parts of the district and from other places use the bus stand every day to reach their destination. However, presence of a few chairs at the platforms serve less than 30 to 50 commuters at a time while others were forced to stand for long hours or simply sit on the platform. “Only three to four chairs with total seating capacity of 12 is present in each platform which is inadequate in a bus stand like this”, said Vadivelu from Vellode. He said that town buses to rural areas are not available frequently and passengers have to wait on the platform for at least 30 minutes. “There is no option to sit on chairs as it is fully occupied and we have to stand”, said the 48-year-old man, who wanted the basic amenities improved on the premises.</p>
      <p>During morning and evening hours, commuters throng bus stand in large numbers every day. However, search for empty chairs is not possible, said Poongodi from Sivagiri. She said that a few occupy the chairs for longer hours and in the absence of waiting rooms, most of the commuters have to stand or sit on platforms. Flower vendors and shopkeepers encroach upon the space in platforms leaving little space for the movement of commuters, said a college student Pushpa from Modakurichi. She wanted basic amenities improved on the bus stand premises, including adequate chairs, and the police to patrol the premises round-the-clock.</p>
      <p>Corporation officials said that there is a proposal to modernise the bus stand during which basic amenities would be upgraded.</p>
