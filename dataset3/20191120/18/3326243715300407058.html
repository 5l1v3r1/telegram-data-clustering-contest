      <p>One of the more <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/28/iphone-11-smart-battery-case-new-rumor/">consistent rumors</a> for months now has been that Apple is working on a Smart Battery Case for the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> and <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro</a> handsets. And here we have another case of a rumor coming true!</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Apple officially launched a brand new Smart Battery Case for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVH2LL/A/iphone-11-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVL2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11 Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVQ2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-max-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-white">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>. Each of the new smart cases feature wireless charging support as well, which should be a welcomed addition for the new accessories.</p>
      <p>Apple took a bit of a break from its Smart Battery Case lineup last year, deciding not to launch the accessory for the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-xr/">iPhone XR</a>, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-xs/">iPhone XS</a>, or <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-xs-max/">iPhone XS Max</a>. But it looks like the company has decided to bring the family back.</p>
      <p>As far as what the new Smart Battery Case brings to the table, Apple says you can get up to 50% more battery life while using the case. It features a soft-touch silicone finish on the outside, making it comfortable to hold and use on a daily basis. The case also features a dedicated camera button (!), which can launch the stock camera app whether the phone is locked or not.</p>
      <p>Here’s how Apple describes that feature:</p>
      <blockquote>The case features a dedicated camera button that launches the Camera app whether the iPhone is locked or unlocked. A quick press of the button takes a photo and a longer press captures QuickTake video. It works for selfies, too.</blockquote>
      <p>You will be able to charge the iPhone and the Smart Battery Case wirelessly thanks to its Qi certification. The case can also be charged through a wired connection.</p>
      <p>The Smart Battery Case is available in a variety of colors (Pink Sand, White, and Black), and it retails for $129.</p>
      <p>Apple should probably update its guide guide to include the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/20/apple-2019-holiday-gift-guide/">new Smart Battery Case</a> for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max!</p>
      <p>Are you planning to pick one (or more) up?</p>
