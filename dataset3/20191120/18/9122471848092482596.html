      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Notre Dame-Boston College</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:56:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Having already lost their games against top opponents Georgia and Michigan, <a href="https://thespun.com/notre-dame-fighting-irish">Notre Dame</a> is just hoping for a New Year’s Six bid at this point. In their final home game of the season, the Irish will take on Boston College in a new edition of the Holy War rivalry.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are no slouches though, and Notre Dame shouldn’t take them lightly. They’ve scored at least 30 points in seven of their ten games. Perhaps the biggest reason that they’re only 5-5 is that their defense is so ineffective.</p>
      <p>ESPN analyst Bill Connelly has examined the win probably of both teams using the <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28099946/sp+-rankings-week-12-battle-1-loss-teams">SP+ computer model</a>.</p>
      <h3>Based on the model, Connelly has determined that Notre Dame has an 89-percent chance of winning. Notre Dame is projected to win the game, 42-21.</h3>

      <p>ND has not lost a game to Boston College in a decade. But it’s often been a tight game as half of their last six games have come down to one score.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the Irish will be heavy favorites at Notre Dame Stadium this weekend. They’re currently 19-point favorites according to Connelly, and are coming off a dominating win over Navy.</p>
      <p>Steve Addazio will need to pull off one of his best gameplans of the year to overcome what Brian Kelly and the Irish have in store for his Eagles.</p>
