      <h1>Decision to put on hold property tax revision may hit the civic body</h1>
      <h2>The Corporation finds itself in difficult spot as it would not able to take up new projects</h2>

      <p>Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani's announcement at a press conference in Chennai on Tuesday that the State government had put on hold the 2018 property tax revision may hit hard the Coimbatore Corporation's finances.</p>
      <p>After the announcement, the Corporation revised property tax for residential buildings by 50% and others by 100%. The revision, it estimated, would bring in ₹ 120 crore more to take the total property tax demand to ₹ 276 crore.</p>
      <p>The Corporation had also estimated that the government's decision to levy the revised tax from the 2018-19 financial year would help it net an additional ₹ 139 crore in arrears – the difference between revised tax and tax paid.</p>
      <p>The revision had come as a blessing for the Corporation that was facing financial crunch and finding difficult to raise money. The poor finances resulted in the civic body making delayed payments to contractors and they in turn waiting for the money to complete the work.</p>
      <p>It also handicapped the Corporation in that the civic body found it difficult to even repair damaged roads or maintain street lights or parks, officials said.</p>
      <p>To overcome the problem the Corporation had in 2018-19 revised water connection deposit and started demanding people to pay the difference between the revised deposit and the money they had already deposited.</p>
      <p>The Corporation had also started levying user fee from houses and commercial establishments for waste collection.</p>
      <p>But as public and political opposition grew to the measures, the Corporation suspended the collection drive within a few months. It found itself in a situation where it had to ask the State government or any of its funding agencies for money to lay roads or undertake any new projects or even meet its share in projects funded by the Central or State governments.</p>
      <p>The State government’s decision now to withhold the property tax revision might see the Corporation finding itself back in the difficult spot and it would sooner than later as the Corporation would have to partly fund the ₹ 168 crore Vellalore bus stand project, said officials.</p>
      <p>They also pointed to the Corporation's obligations to service debts, which according to one officer, was upward of ₹ 500 crore.</p>
      <p>But the silver lining that the Corporation bureaucracy saw was the Central Finance Grant of ₹ 10 crore a month that the Central government would release once an elected was in place. The Government had withheld the disbursement as the city was without an elected council for around three years, they added.</p>
