      <p>European shares fell on Wednesday as concerns over US-China trade escalated after the US Senate passed legislation backing human rights protestors in Hong Kong, drawing condemnation from Beijing.</p>
      <p>The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 0.4 per cent, while the Iseq index in Dublin lost 1.2 per cent to 6,805.60.</p>
      <h3>DUBLIN</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Kerry+Group">Kerry Group</a> was among the main decliners, falling 3.9 per cent to €112.10, as its main shareholder Kerry Co-op took advantage of the stock hitting an all-time high earlier this week to sell €90 million worth of shares.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Origin">Origin</a> Enterprises slid by 7.3 per cent to €4.16 as the agri-services group issued a profit warning as Irish and UK farmers experienced lower crop plantings following abnormally high rainfall levels in the three months through October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Ryanair">Ryanair</a> was also out of sorts, falling by 0.8 per cent to €13.80, as a Spanish court ruled against its policy of charging an extra fee for hand luggage.</p>
      <p>Bucking the trend, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Permanent+TSB">Permanent TSB</a> added 3.7 per cent to €1.19, while Greencoat Renewables gained 1.3 per cent to €1.22.</p>
      <h3>LONDON</h3>
      <p>The FTSE 100 lost 0.8 per cent on its worst day in almost three weeks, as trade concerns weighed on Asia-exposed financial stocks such as <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=HSBC">HSBC</a>, while oil majors <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Shell">Shell</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=BP">BP</a> and industrial stocks also slipped.</p>
      <p>Shares in Aviva fell 3.5 per cent as investors were underwhelmed by a strategy update from the insurer, which analysts say is struggling for direction since replacing its top boss.</p>
      <p>Domestic stocks, which have benefited from polls indicating a likely Conservative victory in the upcoming election, weakened after three sessions.</p>
      <p>Markets are viewing a prospective Tory victory as a positive on hopes that prime minister <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Boris+Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, with a majority in parliament, will be able to reduce uncertainty by delivering Brexit by the January 31st deadline.</p>
      <p>Better-than-expected earnings released by pubs operator Mitchells &amp; Butlers, which is 23.5 per cent own by Irish billionaires JP McManus and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=John+Magnier">John Magnier</a>, pushed its stock up 5.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Other news-driven moves saw AIM-listed Fevertree, which slid in early trading, recoup to rise 8 per cent as the market seemingly shrugged off the tonic water maker’s revenue warning to focus on sales growth in the US.</p>
      <h3>EUROPE</h3>
      <p>European shares logged their worst day in three weeks on Wednesday on mounting worries that rising US-China tensions could take a toll on trade negotiations between the two countries.</p>

      <p>The travel and leisure sectors posted the steepest slide among sub-sectors, led by losses in UK’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=SSP">SSP</a> Group shares after the airport and train food operator issued a cautious full year outlook.</p>

      <p>On the bright side, Nexi shares jumped 5 per cent, helping the Milan index stay in positive territory, after Italy’s biggest retail bank <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Intesa">Intesa</a> Sanpaolo said it was in early talks with the payments group for a potential deal.</p>
      <h3>NEW YORK</h3>
      <p>Wall Street’s main indexes edged lower in early afternoon trading as escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing raised doubts about a trade deal, overshadowing upbeat earnings from retailers <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Target">Target</a> and Lowe’s.</p>
      <p>Target and Lowe’s were the bright spots, with their shares jumping, after the two companies also raised their profit forecasts.</p>
      <p>The interest-rate sensitive financial index fell 0.4 per cent after the benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield hit a three-week low. Banks lending margins are typically squeezed in a low interest-rate environment.</p>
