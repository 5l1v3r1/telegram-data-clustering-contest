      <p>SHELBYVILLE, Ind. – An Indiana photographer has a knack for combining our love for classic Christmas movies with the adorable nature of newborns.</p>
      <p>This year, Amy Haehl at Coffee Creek Studio celebrated the holidays a bit early with an amazing infant photo shoot based on the 1989 film, “National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.”</p>
      <p>Haehl released three <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoffeeCreekStudio/posts/2897137373638954?__xts__[0]=68.ARBd77Ps6G4RI94taq8areERj28NrdQRxvT9b7Tvyw--8mb_epT1CiQ5spUxs5B242lmmZoLuUUWOrIYK0ekh4cdeijRPnBIiudaI8bxObNx-KMXfg3yy7NfSwEOR2s3ZmdM0ktGKtCciU2cqBxH_mAFEaBUau1_YFvBRPdRRLZ7j6eiLMqZOjVvd9SqXoZUZmB4lh6B41orGhRilfLn3Y73JD_ztl6KkKw7oneQ4tqSK5MJ-oC9-LZbcuoEtNxoHofkgCNU1BWQEgasjVNkVvEqL3IMZ83dwe4Ki9S3Zf1ia4KnuOA-4W5ElXiPuadjI6vBTGGC8yh9b6G5PmvqE8Uqj1CCh6st70EXWAvih9q1IcXBXHxRAkWypgpzyLOhduIFj3m281bWjMGV0mKGEjkQ4YVChSLZwVKar2KBJpU4ECK3XdoBFblxYI0mpvmhE9hrYXLsdaYD0QQ347Im&amp;__tn__=-R">photos from the shoot on Facebook,</a> all depicting scenes from the film.</p>
      <p>In one photo, two babies dressed as Clark Griswold and Cousin Eddie are seen taking a snooze on a miniature couch with the infamous burnt Christmas tree in the background and the remnants of a singed cat on the floor.</p>
      <p>Cousin Eddie is also depicted in a second photo, showing the scene where he dumps the waste from his family's RV into the sewer outside the Griswold house.</p>
      <p>A third photo depicts the scene where Clark Griswold fantasizes about a pool and a beautiful woman in his backyard. But in place of the woman is another newborn.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Haehl has ventured into Christmas movie themes. Last year, her <a href="https://fox59.com/2018/11/08/indiana-photographer-defends-a-christmas-story-themed-photo-with-baby-posing-with-bb-gun/">“A Christmas Story”-themed photo shoot went viral</a> , depicting a baby dressed as the main character Ralphie, holding a replica of the BB gun from the film. While the photo shoot was widely praised online, it had its fair share of critics because of the infant holding the gun.</p>

      <p>It seems Haehl wasn’t put off by the controversy though. Her new photos include things some may find inappropriate, like a newborn holding beer and cigar replicas.</p>
      <p>Haehl says the planning for the new photos took well over a year and she hopes everybody gets a good laugh out of them.</p>
      <p>“Figuring out all of the perfect little details and pulling this off has been quite an exhausting process and all I can say is...'Hallelujah! Holy Sh*t! Where's the Tylenol?' - Clark Grizwold”</p>
