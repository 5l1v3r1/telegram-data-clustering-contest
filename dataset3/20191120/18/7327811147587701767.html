      <p>The original Gerber baby, Ann Turner Cook, is celebrating her 93rd birthday on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Cook was just 4 months old when her newborn face became famous.</p>
      <p>In 1928, Gerber held a contest to find a face to represent their baby food advertising campaign.</p>
      <p>According to the company's <a href="https://www.gerberlife.com/about/who-is-the-gerber-baby"><b>website</b></a>, some artists submitted elaborate oil paintings, but one artist, Dorothy Hope Smith, an artist who specialized in children's portraits and who just happened to be Cook's neighbor, submitted a simple charcoal sketch and offered to elaborate on it if it was accepted.</p>
      <p>Gerber executives said they couldn't resist the adorable baby face and selected the classic drawing as is.</p>
      <p>Cook began appearing on Gerber products in 1928 and became the company's official trademark in 1931.</p>
      <p>After growing up, Cook worked as an English teacher for most of her life.</p>
