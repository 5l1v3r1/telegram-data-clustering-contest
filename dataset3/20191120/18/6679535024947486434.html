      <p>Stating that her 29-year-old husband refuses to live with her, a 19-year-old woman sat in protest outside his house at Thappakuttai village in Elampillai here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A third-year degree student, she had married the man a month ago after she and her parents had complained to the All Women Police Station at Sankari that he was avoiding her after having promised to marry her. The man was accused of luring her with the promise of marriage and making her pregnant.</p>
      <p>When she informed him about her pregnancy, he told her that he would marry her after she completed her studies. Later, she aborted the three-month-old foetus. However, she said that the man began avoiding her. It was that she and her parents had complained to the police. Their wedding was then performed at a temple located on the court premises.</p>
      <p>While staging the protest on Tuesday, she said that even after the wedding the husband had not been visiting her house. Magudanchavadi police tried persuading her to withdraw her protest.</p>
