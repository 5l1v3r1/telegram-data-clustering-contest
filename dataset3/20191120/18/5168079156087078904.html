      <p>Sydney: Pakistan have lost their last 12 Tests on Australian soil, with the last win dating back to November 1995. Azhar Ali's young side is aiming to end the losing streak.<br/><br/>Pakistan's ICC World Test Championship campaign begins with a tough assignment first up, as they face a power-packed Australian unit in their own conditions.<br/><br/>Pakistan were decent with the bat when they last toured Australia in 2016-17, but with the bowlers conceding scores of 429, 624/8 declared and 538/8 declared in the first innings of each of the three Tests, they were always left with an uphill task.<br/><br/>This time, leading the charge is a group of young bowlers, who justified their selection by skittling the Australia A side out for a mere 122 in the first warm-up match. Azhar confirmed on the eve of the match that Naseem Shah, the 16-year-old speedster, will make his debut, becoming the youngest male cricketer to play his maiden Test in Australia.</p>
      <p>For Australia, the form of their key players and their track record at the venue, where they last lost a Test more than three decades ago, give them an edge over the visitors. David Warner seems back to his fluent best after a disappointing Ashes series in England, and dismissing Steve Smith early continues to be an unsolved mystery. Their fast-bowling unit, led by Pat Cummins, the top-ranked bowler on the MRF Tyres ICC Test Rankings, seems as dangerous as ever, not to forget the guile of Nathan Lyon, the off-spinner.<br/><br/>Their over-reliance on Smith during the Ashes was a worry, and more consistency will be expected from Joe Burns, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Cameron Bancroft and skipper Tim Paine himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Remember the last time</b><br/><br/>After a draw in the first of two Tests, the series was set up for a decider in Abu Dhabi. Batting first on a slow surface, Pakistan put up 282 with Fakhar Zaman and skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed contributing 94 each. Mohammad Abbas then picked up five wickets, as Australia were bundled out for a mere 145.<br/><br/>Pakistan consolidated their lead of 137, as Babar Azam (99), Sarfaraz (81), Fakhar (66) and Azhar Ali (64) powered them to 400/9 declared, setting Australia a 538-run target. Abbas did it again with another five-for, skittling the visitors out for 164 in 49.4 overs, to give Pakistan a 373-run win â€“ their highest victory margin against Australia, in terms of runs.</p>
