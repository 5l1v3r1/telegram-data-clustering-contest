      <p>We're often envious of <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29476471/pippa-middleton-son-arthur-stroll-london-first-birthday/">Pippa Middleton's wardrobe</a>, and her latest outfit is the perfect example of why. <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a28321019/pippa-middleton-stella-mccartney-wimbledon-2019/">The Duchess of Cambridge's sister</a> made a chic appearance at the ParaSnowBall 2019, which is organized by Disability Snowsport and celebrates the achievements of Paralympic athletes. For the occasion, Middleton wore a beautiful Anna Mason gown, which somehow hasn't sold out just yet.</p>
      <p>The tulle dress retails for $1,405, and features long sleeves and intricate floral embroidery. According to Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/KateMCambridge/status/1197103014273789952">@KateMCambridge</a>, it's thought that Middleton's <a href="https://www.emmylondon.com/">Emmy London</a> clutch and shoes were borrowed from her sister, which is beyond adorable. She completed the look with an eye-catching gold belt and posed for photos with fellow attendees, looking amazing.</p>

      <p>Of her involvement with the event, <a href="https://www.delancey.com/disability-snowsports-uk.html">Middleton revealed</a>, "I am honoured to be supporting Disability SnowSport UK and as a keen skier myself, I feel very passionately about enabling those with a disability to experience the joy of skiing alongside non-disabled people. The ParaSnowBall sponsored by Delancey was an inspirational celebration of Paralympians.”</p>
