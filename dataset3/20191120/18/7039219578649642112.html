      <h1>OPINION: Soybean futures risk is to the upside, trade deal or not</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:59:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:59</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Sernatinger</a></address>
      <p>At a time of rising geopolitical tension between the US and China and with a trade deal appearing less likely to be on the horizon, what upside opportunities are there for soybean prices?</p>
      <p>The answer seems to lie in the sharp fall in ending stocks projected by the USDA for this marketing year.</p>
      <p>From the 2018/19 to 2019/20 marketing year, the USDA ending stock forecasts have virtually halved from 913 million bushels (24.85 million mt) to 475 million bushels (12.92 million mt).</p>
      <p>In the modern era of grain trading, we can find three times when this situation has more-or-less happened.</p>
      <p>The first was from the 2012/13 marketing year to the following marketing year when the carryout went from 143 million bushels down to a modern-day record of 92 million bushels.</p>
      <p>Futures prices averaged $14.76/bu in the 2012/13 season, but then actually fell to an average of $13.53 at the beginning of the 2013/14 period despite the pressure on stocks.</p>
      <p>We can attribute this to two factors.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the 2012/13 crop was hit by a drought crippling the harvest in 2012. Secondly, soybean production rebounded the following year to a record high with traders then realising that large bushel volumes were headed their way.</p>
      <p>So, if this first example was the exception, what about the other two cases?</p>
      <p>From the 2006/07 marketing year to 2007/08, ending stocks fell from 574 million bushels to 205 million bushels. And in this case, tighter supply did have an impact on prices, with average nearby futures rising from $7.30/bu to $12.58/bu.</p>
      <p>For the third example, from the 1994/95 year to 1995/96 soybean ending stocks fell from 335 million bushels to 183 million bushels.</p>
      <p>In this period, average soybean futures prices hit $7.39/bu in 1995/96, up from the $5.70/bu average seen in the preceding marketing year.</p>
      <p>If you think that ending stocks still donâ€™t reflect the situation we are in because of the huge 2019/20 beginning stocks then try this:</p>
      <p>The stocks to use ratio this 2019/20 marketing year is projected to fall from 23% to 11.4%.</p>
      <p>Similar falls were witnessed in all three historical examples given, with the ratio falling in 2013/14 to 2.6% from 4.3% in 2012/13.</p>
      <p>From 2006/07 to 2007/08, the ratio fell from 18.7% to 6.7% and from 1994/95 to 1995/96 it fell from 14% to 7.8%.</p>
      <p>With exception of the first example that we can discount because of the large uptick in production for 2013/14 year in addition to the very high average prices in 2012/13, the other two examples saw average futures prices rise year-on-year by an average 72% (2006/07 to 2007/08) and 30% (1994/95 to 1996/97).</p>
      <p>I think that the risk is looking to be on the upside for the rest of this marketing year.</p>
