        </b>
      </p>
      <p>For so many years, the media space in Nigeria has been populated to the point of over saturation with unwholesome and unhealthy content which do not particularly strive to discover, develop and harness the right value system, culture and principles which lend to a quest for true self discovery with a potential to be a catalyst for a purpose and value driven life and by extension lifestyle.</p>

      <p>With the booming growth in social media accessibility and usage today this challenge had even grown to become one that has almost become and endemic national crisis of identity, direction and aspiration.</p>
      <p>This is largely fueled by higher levels of and exposure to unhealthy tv and media content which leaves a subliminal message imprint on the mind of the viewers who in turn start to adjust themselves to fit into the mould for what become the “acceptable norm” of behaviour or what is termed “cool” through the eyes of the Nigerian youths.</p>
      <p>The Next Titan Nigeria is Nigeria’s foremost entrepreneurial reality TV show which looks to empower young Nigerian entrepreneurs with the requisite information, knowledge and business training to stand them in great stead to start their dream businesses.</p>
      <p>The show has been running consistently for the past 5 years and has empowered five young Nigerian entrepreneurs to start their dream businesses which are today adding value to the Nigerian economy and also creating employment opportunities for more Nigerians.</p>
      <p>This is quite remarkable as other international entrepreneurial show franchises have been brought into Nigeria but due to reasons which are best know to the organizers could not be sustained, yet the Next Titan Nigeria has stayed consistent and committed to her goal which is to empower young Nigerians with the tools, training and funding required to live their dream .</p>
      <p>Without a doubt, the knock on effect of having such an impactful and educative show on TV with widespread publicity and widespread acceptance is that more youths will be inspired to pursue their dreams, make a conscious effort to live value-driven and purposeful lives as well as generally improving the commitment to strong, positive values in the society generally.</p>
