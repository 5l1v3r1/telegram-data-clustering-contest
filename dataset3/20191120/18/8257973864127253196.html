      <h1>Judge orders defamation suit against Tesla chief Elon Musk to trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:16:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ed Adamczyk</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- A California federal judge has ordered a defamation lawsuit against Tesla and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/SpaceX/?tps=1">SpaceX</a> CEO <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Elon_Musk/?tps=1">Elon Musk</a> to move on to a jury trial.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson on Tuesday denied Musk's request to dismiss the charges -- ruling that British explorer and cave diver Verson Unsworth, who Musk criticized, is not a public figure. The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/elon-musk-to-face-trial-over-pedo-guy-tweets.html">decision means</a> Unsworth's suit will have a lower burden of proof in court when the trial starts Dec. 3.</p>
      <p>The case stems from an offer by Musk to send miniature submarines to aid in the rescue of several trapped children inside a Thailand cave last year. Unsworth was critical of Musk's suggestion, which led to a public feud online in which Musk referred to Unsworth via Twitter as a "child rapist" and a "[pedophile] guy."</p>
      <p>A September deposition showed that Musk suggested Unsworth might be "another <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jeffrey_Epstein/?tps=1">Jeffrey Epstein</a>" and the billionaire spent thousands on private investigators to find disparaging evidence against him.</p>
      <p>Musk has said the term "pedo guy" was an insult and not to be taken as a fact -- and argued Unsworth is a public figure because of his involvement in the widely-reported cave rescue. Public figures must meet a higher burden of proof, known as "actual malice," to demonstrate defamation. "Actual malice" indicates a person knowingly expressed a falsehood.</p>
      <p>In his 18-page decision, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/business/media/elon-musk-defamation-lawsuit.html">the judge ruled</a> Unsworth is a private person and must only prove that Musk acted negligently in expressing his views.</p>
      <p>Unsworth seeks damages from Musk in excess of $75,000.</p>
