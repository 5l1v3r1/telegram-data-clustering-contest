        <b>Dundalk have signed former Manchester City academy player Will Patching.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year old creative midfielder was most recently with Notts County for whom he played ten times.</p>
      <p>Patching is the SSE Airtricity Premier Division champions' second arrival of the close season following that of ex Derry midfielder <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/greg-sloggett-swaps-derry-city-dundalk-923145">Greg Sloggett</a>.</p>
      <p>He's a player Dundalk head coach Vinny Perth has clearly admired for some time, "We have been working on this one for a while.</p>
      <p>"Will has had a Rolls Royce upbringing in football. He has been at the very best club in Manchester City. He has been capped underage at England."</p>
      <p>Indeed, Patching captained his country at the 2015 U17 World Cup in a squad that also included Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold, Everton midfielder Tom Davies and Arsenal forward Chris Willock.</p>

      <p>Perth feels Dundalk is the ideal finishing school for Patching, "We feel he may have lost his way a bit in the last year in the game.</p>
      <p>"The final part of his development as a footballer is learning how to play menâ€™s football and becoming a man on the football pitch.</p>
      <p>"A certain amount of that has been done at Notts County where we have watched a lot of his football and we have been very impressed with what we have seen.</p>
      <p>"We believe we are signing a player with huge potential. We believe he can become a real star."</p>
      <p>Patching was impressed by his meetings with Perth, and was sold on the boss's vision for the club, "It has been good and I am glad to be here.</p>
      <p>"The facilities are great and it seems like a good place to play.</p>
      <p>"I have done my research on the club and we have been very successful.</p>
      <p>"I am a player who loves to score goals, assist and play high up the pitch. I am hoping to bring that to the team."</p>
      <p>On paper it appears Patching has replaced <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/robbie-benson-joins-st-patricks-athletic-dundalk-924676">Robbie Benson</a>, who left for St. Pat's after the Unite the Union Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>He wants to help the Lilywhites continue their trophy haul next season, "I want to do well in Europe. That is a big thing for me.</p>
      <p>"I know that the club got to the Group Stages of the Europa League a few years ago and the aim is to get back there.</p>
      <p>"I want to be successful and win everything while I am here."</p>
