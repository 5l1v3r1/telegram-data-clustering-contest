      <h1>PopSockets’ PopGrip AirPods Holder is a detachable iPhone grip/stand and AirPods case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:14:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>PopSockets has debuted an interesting new product for iPhone and AirPods customers today, the <a href="http://bit.ly/2CZXBPN">PopGrip AirPods Holder</a>. It works as a detachable iPhone grip and stand as well as a way to protect and keep your AirPods handy. Follow along below for a closer look…</p>
      <p>PopSockets launched the new PopGrip AirPods Holder today that serves a few fucntions. The <a href="http://bit.ly/2CZXBPN">PopGrip AirPods Holder</a> brings together two simple ideas: an <a href="https://amzn.to/35cORlw">AirPods</a> case and a PopSocket iPhone grip/stand.</p>
      <p>The good news is a quarter turn will release the AirPods Holder from the back of your iPhone anytime you want to keep things slim, charge wirelessly, or use a <a href="http://bit.ly/35hUBKI">different PopGrip</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>This PopGrip has a swappable top — just close the grip flat, press down, and twist 90 degrees to swap out the top. Then, you can swap in a new PopTop or do a little wireless charging. Or just click it in and out again and again to give your fidgety hands something to do.</blockquote>
      <p>The PopGrip AirPods Holder (for first and second-gen AirPods) is available now <a href="http://bit.ly/2CZXBPN">direct from PopSockets priced at $20</a>. It comes in black, white, cobalt, iris purple, and neo mint.</p>
      <p>PopSockets notes that a PopGrip base won’t stick directly to the back of an iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max and will adhere best to “smooth hard plastic cases.”</p>
