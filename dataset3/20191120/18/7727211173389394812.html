      <p>An animal rescue centre posted heartwarming pictures of a dog's miraculous recovery - a year after <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/someone-poured-boiling-water-six-15926535">a sickening attack</a> in which she had boiling water poured over her.</p>
      <p>Staff at Freshfields Animal Rescue said they were left "reeling" over the horrific state of the injured puppy when she was brought to their door.</p>

      <p>Although they were told the puppy had been found in the street, her injuries pointed strongly to her having been subjected to severe, sustained cruelty and abuse.</p>
      <p>On further examination by a vet, it was found the puppy's horrendous injuries were caused by boiling water being poured over her.</p>

      <p>She was covered in wounds consistent with untreated scald burns. Her ears were torn and bleeding and she showed obvious signs of malnourishment.</p>
      <p>The animal rescue centre has now posted new pictures on Facebook of the amazing transformation of the puppy - named Maple by staff - over the past year.</p>
