      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">President Donald Trump</a> told reporters on the White House lawn on Wednesday that he didn’t make any requests of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that there was no quid pro quo for Ukraine to investigate former <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Vice President Joe Biden</a> and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid.</p>
      <p>Trump dismissed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearing-updates-sondland-cooper-hale-testimony-2019-11">testimony in the impeachment inquiry from Gordon Sondland</a>, his handpicked ambassador to the European Union who had donated $1 million to his inauguration fund and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181560708808486914">was described by Trump in October</a> as “a really good man and great American.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know him very well. I haven’t spoken to him very much. This is not a man I know well,” Trump said of Sondland. “Seems like a nice guy though.”</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zelensky-ukraine-call-transcript-quid-pro-quo-biden-2019-9">White House’s memo</a> of Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky – which Trump frequently insists everyone read – says Trump asked Zelensky to do him a “favor” and speak to his attorney general about investigating the Bidens. Five witnesses in the impeachment inquiry so far have testified under oath that Trump wanted the investigation in exchange for releasing the military aid, which Trump also discussed in the call, as part of a quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>Trump made the comment about Sondland while reading from notes written in giant Sharpie lettering on Air Force One stationary.</p>
      <p>The notes said: “I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing. This is the final word from the pres of the U.S.”</p>

      <p>He also <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/1197209371308109824">appeared to hold a piece of paper with a single tweet</a> in which a Reuters White House correspondent described Sondland as saying that Trump didn’t tell him that aid for Ukraine – already authorized by Congress – would be released only if Ukraine investigated the Bidens.</p>
