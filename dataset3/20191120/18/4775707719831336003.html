      <p>With the last Turkey Trial in 2016, the idea was to hunt Super-Turkeys and harvest wishbones, which could then be used to craft a Chieftain Hat, Turkey emote, or to summon the DodoRex to do your bidding for a short while. Super-Turkeys are back this year, and just as deadly as ever. They look like normal-sized turkeys, but are very aggressive and will fight back when hunted. Plus, whichever wild animals are nearby might join in to help them in the fight. Super-Turkeys drop hides, meat, and the coveted wishbones. These wishbones will again unlock new cosmetic items such as the Pilgrim Hat Skin, the Chieftain Hat Skin, and the Turkey Swim Bottom Skin.</p>
      <p>Along with Turkey Trial 3 are new <b>event rates.</b> During the event, there'll be<b> 2x breeding</b> (which includes the mating interval, egg hatching speed, and maturation), along with <b>2x Player XP</b> and <b>Harvesting. </b>There'll be <b>new emotes</b> available: the Belly Rub Emote, Hungry Emote, and Food Coma Emote. The full <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/community-crunch-207-mysterious-mysteries-turkey-trial-3-and-on-the-horizon-r1446/">list</a> of new <b>event items</b> is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pilgrim Hat</li>
        <li>Bonnet Hat</li>

        <li>Turkey Leg club skin</li>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres â€” when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
