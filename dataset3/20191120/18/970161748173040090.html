      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-fans-shocked-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184419/">Emmerdale viewers had a shock last night</a> when they learned that paedophile <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein) is pregnant.</p>
      <p>Tuesday night’s episode of the soap saw Maya released from prison after serving half her sentence, following her grooming and sexual abuse of teenager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (Joe Warren-Plant).</p>
      <p>However the character was seen sporting a noticeable baby bump as she left prison and headed off.</p>
      <p>So just who is the father of her baby – and could this mark <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/22/is-maya-stepney-returning-to-emmerdale-what-happened-between-her-and-jacob-10615145/">a return to Emmerdale for the character?</a></p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Who is the father of Maya’s baby in Emmerdale?</h3>
      <p>As it stands we don’t know who the father of Maya’s baby is.</p>

      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>So either one of them could feasibly be Maya’s babyfather.</p>
      <p>The shock pregnancy was revealed as Jacob learned from David and Leyla (Roxi Shahidi) that Maya was due for release – and initially he seemed to brush the news off, claiming he was going out to the cinema <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-jacob-maya-pregnant-age-leanna-return-11187552/">with Leanna (Mimi Slinger).</a></p>
      <p>While David and Leyla were pleased that the teenager appeared to be moving on with his life, he later disappeared as he attempted to track Maya down.</p>
      <p>He failed to do so, but did attempt to ring her – with viewers seeing Maya deleting Jacob’s number from her phone before walking off, and making it very clear that she’s expecting.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/is-maya-stepney-returning-to-emmerdale-11176820/">As it stands Maya is not set to come back,</a> with a spokesperson <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-no-return-planned-for-maya-stepney-amid-pregnancy-twist-11184975/">for the soap telling metro.co.uk:</a> ‘There are no current plans for Maya to return.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>However Louisa Clein – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-louisa-clein-reacts-shocking-maya-stepney-baby-twist-11184494/">who took to Twitter in the wake of the reveal</a> – recently explained that she wasn’t ruling it out, adding that there could be more to explore with the character.</p>
      <p>‘There’s certainly room for the story to develop,’ she said at the Inside Soap Awards.</p>
      <p>‘We purposefully made this story go for a long long time and there will be long long repercussions with Jacob, with David, with all the people she affected in the village, so who knows?’</p>
