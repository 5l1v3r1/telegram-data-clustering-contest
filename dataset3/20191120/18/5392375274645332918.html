      <h1>Qualcomm 5G expectations disclosed in a rollout roadmap for 2020+</h1>

      <p>Qualcomm 5G expectations disclosed in a rollout roadmap for 2020 and beyond<br/>1 (20%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>The US giant of chipsets, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/5G">Qualcomm</a> is one of the major companies in the mobile segment, but also has an important role to play with the adoption of 5G. The company recently held its 2019 Analyst Day in New York City. During the event, Qualcomm’s president Cristiano Amon disclosed a visual roadmap for the global rollout of 5G networks. Qualcomm 5G expectations can be seen through a comprehensive visual roadmap. For instance, it lists several countries where the 5G network is ready or coming.</p>
      <p>Amon states that Qualcomm expects 5G to become broadly available in major cities during the next year. Moreover, the company believes that 5G will spread among developing countries in 2021. The visual roadmap also reveals that the mid-band (sub-6GHz) variant of 5G is projected to spread far and wide during 2020.</p>

      <h3>Qualcomm 5G will gain traction in developing markets in 2020</h3>
      <p>The initial set of countries included in the initial rollout are Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Austria, France, Turkey, India, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Africa. In addition, the faster but shorter-distance millimeter-wave 5G will reach Japan, South Korea, and Russia in the next year.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Qualcomm expects to see mid-band 5G spreading across Peru, Nigeria, and developing countries in Asia starting in 2021. Moreover, 22 small European countries will also receive it.  When it comes to the Millimetre-wave 5G, it may spread to Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, Hong Kong, and Singapore at the same time.</p>

      <p>Of course, to kick off the 5G adoption we will need chipsets with proper support to the new network standard. According to the company’s exec, the 5G support will become available on its entire portfolio of products in 2020. He mentions the Snapdragon 6xx, 7xx, 8xx series and beyond. He omits the 4xx series, so we probably won’t see sub $100 smartphones with 5G coming with Qualcomm chipsets. At least not in the next year. The company will offer premium-chips with 5G regardless of the coverage. So it will be up to the country’s respective telecom companies to offer proper 5G solutions to support this new batch of smartphones.</p>
