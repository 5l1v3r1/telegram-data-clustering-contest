      <h1>5 things we noticed as Jose Mourinho takes Tottenham training for first time</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho held his first training session as Tottenham manager on Wednesday and was keen to make a good first impression</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:15:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho began life as Tottenham Hotspur manager by leading his new charges in their first training session on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese was announced as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor at 6:30am, following the Argentine’s sacking on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Between the departure of Pochettino and the welcoming of the ex-Manchester United and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss, Spurs chiefs made the decision to change their training schedule.</p>
      <p>Spurs stars back from international duty had been due to get down to work at Hotspur Way on the morning, but the session was subsequently moved to the afternoon.</p>
      <p>That decision was made so that Mourinho and members of his new-look training staff could immediately get down to work, ahead of their debut in Saturday’s London derby against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Here’s five things we spotted from Mourinho’s first session at the club’s Enfield base…</p>

      <h3>1) Getting the captain on side</h3>
      <p>Harry Kane is clearly a senior figure in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> dressing room.</p>
      <p>So it is no surprise Jose Mourinho is keen to get the captain on side.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Kane paid tribute to Mauricio Pochettino after his departure, but Mourinho was spotted in deep talks with Kane at the training ground.</p>
      <p>Getting the England front-man on side will not only be key to dressing room morale, but also on-field success as they need their talisman firing.</p>
      <h3>2) Keeping a close eye</h3>
      <p>Jose Mourinho was seen getting right up close to the action as he runs the rule over his new players.</p>
      <p>Mourinho says he has inherited a squad any manager would want due to its young talent.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But he still has plenty to learn about his new squad.</p>
      <p>His first session saw him getting stuck in and keeping a very close eye on proceedings as his players were put through their paces.</p>
      <h3>3) Plenty of plans.</h3>
      <p>Mourinho walked onto the training ground with clipboard in hand - and he seems armed with ideas.</p>
      <p>It is hoped the legendary manager will provide a fresh impetus on the squad which reached the Champions League final last year.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>His clipboard already seemed thick and containing plenty of plans for his very first training session.</p>
      <p>Did it contain the wisdom they need to get their Premier League campaign back on track?</p>
      <p>I guess we'll soon find out...</p>
      <h3>4) Words of wisdom for Dele</h3>
      <p>When Jose Mourinho walked into Chelsea back in 2004, he told Frank Lampard: “You are the best player in the world.”</p>
      <p>You have to wonder whether he has said something similar to Dele Alli upon their first meeting today.</p>

        <figcaption>Mourinho seemed to have some words of wisdom for Dele Alli (Image: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s been a difficult season for Alli so far, in and out of the side, having largely sacrificed himself in a deeper midfield role during 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Last year he scored just seven times, well down on the 14 of 2017-18 and the 22 of 2016-17.</p>
      <p>So the question now is how does Mourinho see him?</p>
      <p>And can he make him into his new Lampard?</p>
      <h3>5) Building relationships</h3>
      <p>Mourinho was seen giving his players a drinks break to stay hydrated during their training session.</p>
      <p>But he was keen to stay close by and take the chance for a casual chat with his players.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>First impressions are key as Mourinho chatted with his players (Image: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Portuguese boss knows he will need to build morale quickly if he's to make an instant impact.</p>
      <p>It's easy to see why he wants to make a positive first impression.</p>
