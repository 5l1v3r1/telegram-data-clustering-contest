      <p>Wednesday is our Newcastle United Q &amp; A day and this week it was the turn of Football Publishing Editor Mark Douglas to answer reader posers on all matters black and white.</p>
      <p>With United’s next game on Monday, there was plenty of interest in other matters before turning to the Villa Park clash. Here’s a full transcript of what was said.</p>
      <h3>What are the chances of the club being sold in the near future? Or is it completely dead?</h3>
      <p>Near future? I think pretty low. We’ve heard the noises from potential buyers down the years and fans are cynically expecting another burst of publicity before the next transfer window but there doesn’t seem to be anything on the horizon. <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-takeover-peter-kenyon-17108120">Peter Kenyon’s group don’t seem to have made any progress</a> and the Orlegi consortium, strangely thrust back into the fray by David Ornstein at the Athletic, aren’t in a position to broker anything soon.</p>
      <p>Mike Ashley is not an easy man to do business with when it comes to Newcastle and I think it’ll take determination, funds and a huge commitment to buying the club to get past the beefed up due diligence process (since the summer) and to actually agreeing a deal with him.</p>
      <p>I wouldn’t say it’s dead because I hear of interest all the time. But if it gets sold I think it blindsides us and is done quickly.</p>

      <h3>Are Newcastle United going to be busy in January?</h3>
      <p>That’s what agents and intermediaries believe. <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-transfers-bruce-xhaka-17261999">Steve Bruce is playing things very low-key at the moment</a> and I think that’s a deliberate tactic to depress expectations of another big splurge by the club.</p>
      <p>I’d be surprised if they did anything huge but one or two additions should be forthcoming – with the domestic loan slots looking the best bet to supplement what they’ve got.</p>
      <p>In terms of permanent transfers, my feeling is that it’ll depend on whether anyone with first team potential is sold. They’ll be listening to offers for Dwight Gayle – although don’t expect that to be advertised publicly – and if he leaves, a replacement would be possible.</p>

      <h3>What is the situation with Sean Longstaff’s contract – and Matty’s?</h3>
      <p>Sean is in talks with the club based on the agreement of both parties that his contribution – and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-manchester-united-sean-longstaff-17273784">the interest from Manchester United in the summer</a> – has bumped up his status and value to the club. His representatives believe he is due another wage bump and the player wants to stay but Newcastle will no doubt see it as a balancing act: he only signed a new deal 12 months ago and we’re in the first year of a four-year deal.</p>
      <p>It’ll get done, but expect to-ing and fro-ing. Academy graduates never seem to get the rewards or recognition of other players.</p>
      <p>On Matty, despite the claims a deal is sealed it’s not there yet. Again, I’d expect it to be sealed before he walks away but Newcastle need to reflect his improved status with a fair offer. There is interest in him and United are vulnerable.</p>

      <h3>Is the Xhaka talk accurate?</h3>
      <p>Steve Bruce wants him so there is certainly interest. What we don’t know is how the club views the idea of an expensive loan move until the end of the season for a player closer to 30 than 20.</p>
      <p>Rafa Benitez got Salomon Rondon on loan of course but it was a major bone of contention. Before we start getting his name on the back of black-and-white shirts, it might be worth considering how the hierarchy view the idea of the loan.</p>
      <p>Newcastle want to back Bruce, having been impressed with the way he’s handled himself and worked with players signed in the summer who were effectively scouted for him. There’s certainly more goodwill in terms of recruitment going into January than there was with Benitez 12 months ago (the relationship seemed close to collapse by then).</p>
      <p>Don’t write it off entirely but it’d still be a surprise to see the deal done. A pleasant one given how capable he is, despite his travails at Arsenal.</p>

      <h3>Do you think the pundits proclaiming Steve Bruce deserves all the credit for Newcastle being mid-table will live to regret it?</h3>
      <p>Nothing sums up modern-day Newcastle more than the debate over Bruce. In one corner we have those who refuse to give him any credit – with some still handing Benitez the credit for results, crazily – while pundits (usually the ones who played or know Bruce) are eagerly clambering over themselves to show that this is proof they were right to say he should be given a chance and he’s a better boss than given credit for.</p>
      <p>The reality is probably somewhere in between <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/what-happened-jamaal-lascelles-confronted-17016741">the visceral criticism that followed Leicester</a> and the possibly over-the-top praise after Bournemouth. There’s a lot of road left to run in this season yet and Newcastle could easily get dragged back into things with back-to-back defeats in late November and early December.</p>
      <p>Bruce was never as incompetent as some of his detractors made out when he was appointed, but he’s not Pep Guardiola reincaranted because they’ve won twice. As I said at the start of the season: give him a chance. But let’s not rush to a positive judgement before the year has even turned.</p>

      <h3>What is happening with the Fans Forum and Mike Ashley’s promise to open the accounts?</h3>
      <p>My understanding is that the club have been working with the remaining Fans Forum members and the Newcastle United Supporters Trust (NUST) on the composition of the fans forum and an announcement isn’t far away.</p>
      <p>The club tell us they’re going to provide detailed accounts to the NUST. No timescale has been put on it yet.</p>

      <h3>What do you think of the Strawberry Place saga?</h3>
      <p>A damning indictment of Ashley and his way of running Newcastle that poses some big questions of the owner. Strawberry Place might only be a relatively small patch of land but it represents something much bigger: potential for the club to possibly expand or at the very least increase its city centre foot print under a different manager.</p>
      <p>Instead it’s been sold – with Ashley’s MASH Holdings benefiting from the sale and not United – with no benefit whatsoever to Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Why has the money not been pumped back into the club? Why was it sold in the way it was? Someone should be answering those questions.</p>
      <p>By the time it came to the planning decision earlier this month, it was too late. It raises big questions about the accountability of Ashley over something that does have an impact on the club long after he’s sold up.</p>
      <p>As Alex Hurst of the NUST said to me: “This may actually linger longer than the two relegations.”</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Why has Ashley not been at games?</h3>
      <p>The suggestion is he thinks it may be a distraction but he goes through periods of being much more hands-off from time to time (before then taking a keen interest). Who knows how his mind works when it comes to United?</p>
      <p>I’d be surprised if we didn’t see him at a match before the end of the season, though.</p>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article16503196.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1042954280.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Do you expect any changes for the Aston Villa match?</h3>
      <p>Obviously Jamaal Lascelles will be replaced, with Paul Dummett the likely contender to come in for him. It would be interesting to see how close Florian Lejeune is – he’s arguably the most influential centre-back of the lot when fit.</p>
      <p>Otherwise I think it’ll be the same again for Newcastle. They’re looking pretty sprightly at the moment so they’ll travel to the Midlands full of confidence.</p>
