      <h1>Kanye West announces 'Jesus is King Part II' in collaboration with Dr. Dre</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">The Jakarta Post</a></address>
      <p>Last month, West unveiled his ninth studio album, "Jesus is King," which was named to reflect his recent recommitment to Christianity.</p>
      <p>Although the gospel-infused opus suffered from a chaotic album rollout, the rapper recently announced that he is working on the follow-up to "Jesus is King" with legendary producer Dr. Dre.</p>
      <p>"Ye and Dre Jesus is King Part II coming soon," he announced in a post on Twitter, which also features a photo of the pair in the recording studio.</p>

      <p>Although details about the album are still scarce to this date, "Jesus is King Part II" would likely continue West's foray into taking gospel rap mainstream.</p>

      <p>This past September, the musician reportedly announced that he will no longer be making secular music, stating that he will solely focus on making "only gospel from here on out."</p>
      <p>"Jesus is King Part II" would also mark West's first official collaboration with Dr. Dre, who Yeezy described in a previous Rolling Stone essay as "the definition of a true talent."</p>
      <p>At the time, the rapper also added that "Dre feels like God placed him here to make music"-- a statement in tune with the recent declarations that West made while paying a visit to renowned televangelist Joel Osteen in his Houston megachurch.</p>
      <p>"I know that God's been calling me for a long time and the devil's been distracting me for a long time. Jesus has won the victory. I told you about my arrogance and cockiness already. Now the greatest artist that God has ever created is now working for him," West stated.</p>
      <p>In addition to announcing "Jesus is King Part II," the musician revealed earlier this week that his first-ever opera, "Nebuchadnezzar," will debut on November 24 at Los Angeles's Hollywood Bowl.</p>

      <p>The upcoming opera will be directed by his frequent collaborator and Italian performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, with music by his Sunday Service collective as well as Peter Collins &amp; Infinities Song.</p>
