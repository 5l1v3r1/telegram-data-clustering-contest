      <blockquote>After several weeks of work it's finally finished! I'd like to share a few things from behind the scenes while I created this in blender.<br/><br/>This video had so many moving parts that the viewport couldn't play it in real time. So I split everything into collections that I could toggle on or off depending on what I was working on.<br/>The steps each had a "follow path" constraint with the "offset" property driven by a driver. Each step needed to have the driver be slightly different so the steps were positioned around the curve. This was all done through a python script that I wrote.<br/><br/>The rotation of each step was also done in a similar manner. I manually set up the fcurves for the driver on one of the steps and then copied it to the rest. I used a python script to set up all of these drivers. I can't image the night mare it would have been to manually do this by hand! My next video hopefully won't contain this many moving parts.<br/><br/>Thanks for watching and let me know if you have any feedback!</blockquote>
