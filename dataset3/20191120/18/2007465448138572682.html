      <h1>2020 Aston Martin DBX SUV is what 007 drives when he has kids</h1>
      <h2>What do you think of Aston Martin’s very first SUV?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:19:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/jose-altoveros.html" target="_blank">Jose Altoveros</a></address>
      <p>Since the brand started 106 years ago, Aston Martin has continuously built some of the most beautiful, head-turning sports cars and grand tourers ever. Despite going through some tough times in the past, never has the British marque ever built a high-riding crossover or SUV. Today, that has changed.</p>
      <p>This is the DBX, Aston Martin’s first-ever SUV, and we reckon it's going to be 007's drive of choice if he had a family.</p>

      <p>007 won't be disappointed as the DBX features similar design cues to Aston Martin's current lineup of sports cars. In particular, it looks like a high-riding Vantage with four-doors and large cargo space. Going into the details, one can easily recognize the SUV’s front end as that of an Aston Martin with the signature grill and high mounted headlights. At the rear, it has Vantage design cues especially the integrated ducktail.</p>

      <p>This goes without saying: the DBX has a lot more room as compared to any other Aston Martin model available today. There’s no shortage of luxury goods either. The seats are wrapped in full-grain leather. Meanwhile, the headliner and electric roof blind are being offered in Alcantara. Want a personal touch? Q by Aston Martin can machine the center console out of solid wood as well. A full-length glass panoramic sunroof then lets lots of light in if needed.</p>

      <p>Since it is an SUV, the DBX can hold a lot of stuff compared to other AM models. Specifically, there is 1,540 liters worth of space in the boot with the second row folded. With the second row up, that goes down to 832 liters. Items at the rear can be accessed through a 40:20:40 split rear seats.</p>
      <p>There’s no shortage of technology in the DBX either. A 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay is fitted dead center, keeping occupants entertained. Meanwhile, a 12.3 digital instrument cluster provides the driver with all the necessary information needed. A 360-degree camera system makes it easier to maneuver the vehicle in tight spaces.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the DBX is powered by a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8; the same engine used in the DB11 and the Vantage. However, the engine has been tuned for the DBX, now producing 550 horsepower and 700 Nm of torque. Power is then sent to all four wheels via a 9-speed automatic transmission. An active central differential and an electric rear limited-slip differential ensure traction no matter the terrain.</p>

      <p>Want a DBX? Aston Martin is offering its first-ever SUV with the 1913 package. Choosing to do so adds an extra touch of exclusivity with unique fender badges and plaques all around. Meanwhile, the first 500 DBX owners will have their vehicles personally inspected and endorsed by Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer.</p>
      <p>The Aston Martin DBX comes with a retail price of $189,900 in the United States. Given the affinity of the Philippine market for SUVs, we expect them to be laying the groundwork to bring the DBX to our roads. Given our taxes though, we expect the SRP to be easily double the price in Europe or in the United States.</p>
