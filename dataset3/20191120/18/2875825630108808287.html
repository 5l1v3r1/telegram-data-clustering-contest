      <h1>Homeless kids in emergency accommodation twice as likely to be hospitalised and far more likely to be bullied</h1>
      <h2>These are just some of the shocking findings in a report from the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland released on World Children's Day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:13:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Ferghal Blaney</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/homelessness">Homeless</a> children living in emergency accommodation are twice as likely to be hospitalised and far more likely to be bullied in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/schools">school</a> or develop chronic diseases like <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/asthma">asthma</a>.</p>
      <p>These are just some of the shocking findings in a report from the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland released on World Children's Day today.</p>
      <p>It is another shameful indictment of the Government’s failure to tackle the housing crisis as there are 4,000 children among 10,000 homeless who have no place to call home every night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/labour">Labour</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/housing">housing</a> spokeswoman, Jan O’Sullivan, has called for urgent action in the wake of this report.</p>
      <p>She said: “This is a truly heartbreaking situation and a poor reflection on modern Ireland.”</p>
      <p>The evidence from the report shows that: 38% of homeless children have mental health or behavioural disorders of clinical significance, those in unsafe housing are more likely to be bullied and less likely to see their friends and twice as many homeless children require emergency hospitalisation.</p>
      <p>The paper highlights the unacceptable health risks and harm experienced by thousands of children affected by Ireland’s housing crisis and which potentially can have long-term health implications for them into adulthood.</p>
      <p>Dr Julie Heslin, lead author on the paper, said delaying action is detrimental to our children and their futures.</p>

      <p>“We know that the impact on a person’s health and wellbeing of adverse experiences in childhood lasts well beyond childhood and becomes apparent in adult life as mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and relationship difficulties, as well as physical disease, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes.</p>
      <p>“These children are the future of our society – not just some of these children, all of them.</p>
      <p>“We must listen to them.</p>
      <p>“Where they have no voice and no understanding of their situation, we have a responsibility to speak up for them.”</p>

      <p>Ms O’Sullivan added: “At the very least, we believe that in a crisis accommodation situation, the rights of a child should be at the heart of every decision made regarding a homeless family.</p>
      <p>“We’re again calling on the Government to progress our Homeless Families Bill which we believe would bring about a change in approach in how local authorities deal with families in this regard, and would prevent for example, a homeless family being placed in a Garda station overnight as has happened in the past.</p>
      <p>“The housing and homelessness crisis is one of the biggest issues facing the country at present and is having a harmful effect on our children. It needs to be treated with the urgency it requires.”</p>
