      <h1>Amazon Stock Will Eventually Be Boosted by Its Cloud Unit</h1>
      <h2>Investors should buy AMZN stock</h2>

      <p>One can forgive investors for not knowing what to make of <b>Amazon </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/"><b><u>AMZN</u></b></a>) stock. The conglomerate attracts attention partly because of its numerous initiatives across multiple industries. However, of course, it’s most well–known for its e-commerce operations.</p>

      <p>Admittedly, those who focus on Amazon;s retail business will  view AMZN stock as a loser. That’s largely because the company’s  new initiatives in that area are cutting into its profits.</p>
      <p>However, most of Amazon’s profits are now generated by its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon had a crucial setback in that area as well, as it recently lost a huge Pentagon contract to <b>Microsoft </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/"><b><u>MSFT</u></b></a>).</p>
      <p>However, given the growth of the cloud and the profits that Amazon’s cloud business should generate, investors can still profit from AMZN stock.</p>
      <h3>AMZN Is Stuck in a Holding Pattern</h3>
      <p>Recently, AMZN stock has been range-bound, partly because the company is offering costly new benefits to Prime members such as one-day shipping. Those initiatives are weighing  on the company’s profits and hurting the performance of AMZN stock.</p>
      <p>Still, for all of the focus on Amazon’s retail operations, they have never generated the majority of the company’s profits. The e-commerce business has helped the company’s revenue climb rapidly. But the business’s low margins have kept a lid on its profitability, preventing it from lifting Amazon stock price very much.</p>
      <p>In fact,  Amazon stock hasn’t risen much over the last 18 months. There are a few reasons for that.</p>
      <p>In the past, investors have been concerned about the valuation of AMZN stock. Amazon’s retail business has  also lost its air of invincibility as retailers such as <b>Walmart </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/wmt-stock-quote/"><b><u>WMT</u></b></a>) and <b>Target </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tgt-stock-quote/"><b><u>TGT</u></b></a>) have successfully fought back against Amazon recently.</p>
      <h3>Focus on Profit Growth</h3>
      <p>Still, the company’s cloud business, AWS, drives the majority of its profits. So Amazon stock price should primarily be determined by its cloud business.</p>
      <p>AWS has had some problems lately. It did not obtain a $10 billion contract to upgrade the Department of Defense’s cloud infrastructure. Microsoft got the lucrative deal instead.</p>
      <p>Competition from other cloud providers  has also worried the owners of AMZN stock. For example, <b>Alphabet’s </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/googl-stock-quote/"><b><u>GOOGL</u></b></a>, NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/goog-stock-quote/"><b><u>GOOG</u></b></a>) Google Cloud just made itself more of a threat to AWS by acquiring CloudSimple.</p>
      <p>Still, I think investors are ignoring  the massive amount of earnings increases that AWS will likely generate.</p>
      <p>Analysts, on average, forecast mean annual profit growth for AMZN  of 50.3%  over the next five years.  The anticipated rapid profit growth makes Amazon’s forward price-earnings ratio of around 62.4 acceptable.  The fact that the P/E ratio of AMZN stock has  often been well over 100 in past years makes its current valuation more attractive.</p>
      <p>More importantly, Amazon;s profits are expected to increase at a rate typically achieved by successful start-ups. Yet, based on market cap, Amazon is the fourth-largest company in the world,. It’s unusual for such a large company to increase its profits so rapidly.</p>
      <p>Amazon’s profit growth has decelerated this year. But the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/04/07/public-cloud-soaring-to-331b-by-2022-according-to-gartner/#67ed9cea5739">cloud industry</a>, which generated revenue of $182.4 billion in 2018, is expected to grow to an estimated $331.2 billion by 2022. For all of the talk about its competition, AWS remains the leader of this segment.</p>
      <p>As investors begin to see AWS rapidly grow, I think they will again overlook the high valuations of AMZN stock, enabling Amazon stock price to retest its highs above $2,000 per share.</p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line on AMZN Stock</h3>
      <p>After trading at triple-digit-percentage  P/E ratios for a long time, AMZN stock now has a forward P/E ratio of around 62. Moreover, for all of the attention its retail business receives, Amazon primarily depends on the cloud for most of its profits.</p>
      <p>Despite losing the Pentagon deal, Amazon is expected to generate annual earnings growth  of over 50% on average after this year. As these numbers begin to show up on the company’s earnings reports, Amazon stock should jump to $2,000 per share and beyond.</p>
