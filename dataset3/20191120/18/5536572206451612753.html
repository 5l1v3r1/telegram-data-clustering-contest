      <h1>Dez Bryant Seemingly Takes Shots At The Cowboys, Saints On Twitter: ‘Ask Any Black Player’ (TWEETS)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:47:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Dez Bryant stated he would be trying to get back into the league in 2019, but ranting on Twitter is certainly not how you do it.</p>
      <p>The free agent WR jumped on Twitter Tuesday to ask Colin Kaepernick a couple of questions after his controversial workout this past weekend, and it had social media coming after Bryant.</p>
      <p>In the midst of his responses about Kaepernick — Bryant seemingly blasted the Saints and the Cowboys, first taking aim at the team that drafted him and their treatment of Black players.</p>
      <p>“Ask any black player on the Cowboys how I acted.”</p>

      <p>He then went after the Saints:</p>

      <p>He then attempted to clarify his earlier tweets, but left another vague response about telling the story of what happened with no further details.</p>

      <p>Bryant seems to be all over the place with his story. As he said, I guess we have to wait for the real story to come out, if it ever comes out.</p>
      <p>Still no word on if he’ll be back in the league anytime soon.</p>
