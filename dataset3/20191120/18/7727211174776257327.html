      <p>In the Premier League in 2019, how far can you make £50million stretch?</p>
      <p>Enough to buy France international midfielder? Not quite. Tottenham paid that plus the best part of a further four million to land Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>A young winger with bags of potential? Not necessarily. Chelsea were made to pay £58m for Christian Pulisic to snare him from Borussia Dortmund in January.</p>
      <p>An England centre-back? They don't come cheap these days following Harry Maguire's £80m switch to Manchester United in August.</p>
      <h3>Liverpool news and transfers <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-latest-transfer-news-live-17284632">LIVE</a> - Karim Adeyemi linked, Training ground latest, Sander Berge chase</h3>
      <p>Little wonder then, that Jurgen Klopp and his backroom staff at Liverpool opted to keep their powder dry in the transfer market after sealing a Champions League triumph in June.</p>
      <p>A 97-point haul in the Premier League saw them miss out on the title by just a single point to the most expensively assembled squad in football in Manchester City, three weeks before European Cup number six <a href="https://championsleaguewinners2019.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">was paraded in front of 750,000 celebrating supporters</a> on the city streets.</p>
      <p>Put simply, Liverpool's was a squad that was not in need of costly surgery back in the summer months. An eight-point lead at the summit of the Premier League is proof of that, just now.</p>
      <p>Instead, the club are making their latest £50m investment work harder than any energetic central midfielder could as progress remains ongoing <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/latest-50m-kirkby-training-facility-17286379">on their new state-of-the-art training facility in Kirkby</a>.</p>
      <p>Anfield officials remain on course - and crucially, on budget - <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-academy-melwood-klopp-kirkby-16683425">to open their new training facility</a> in time to welcome Klopp's first-team stars for the beginning of pre-season in July.</p>

      <p>They, along with all the club's various age groups in their development squads, will be housed under one roof for the first time in their history as the club wave goodbye to the iconic Melwood.</p>
      <p>A bright new future awaits when the door closes on the legendary West Derby ground next year for the final time.</p>
      <p>It's sure to be an emotional affair when that day comes, but eight miles up the road, a revolution, of sorts, is firmly in motion.</p>
      <p>The 9,200 square metre centre will be a facility that will aim to shape the next generation of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> stars as well as seamlessly helping out the current crop in their ongoing pursuit of becoming the best team in world football.</p>

      <p>It's an expansive and ambitious plan from the club - one in-keeping with their current status in the world game - and the sprawling, new-look complex, designed by London architects KSS, will be set up to compete with some of the best facilities anywhere in European football when they are eventually unveiled.</p>
      <p>They comprise of two gyms, a full-size sports hall, pool, a hydrotherapy complex as well as specialist sports rehabilitation suites for injured players to use when aiming to regain fitness.</p>
      <p>Open-plan rooms have been designed for the gyms to allow players recovering from injury to see the training pitches in front of them as a source of motivation in their often arduous and draining recovery processes.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most telling plan of all, however, centres around the Liverpool first team and logistics of the Kirkby site itself..</p>
      <p>Restrictions will be placed on entrances to the first-team area of the training ground as Klopp aims to make promotion to the senior part of the complex an incentive rather than a right for Academy hopefuls.</p>
      <p>It is a move designed to refocus any young player on the club's books who thinks the hard work is over now they can feasibly rub shoulders with established talents like Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mane or Mohamed Salah.</p>
      <p>The message is simple - first-team exposure must be earned. The Kirkby compound will give them every opportunity to achieve it.</p>

      <p>Klopp may currently be earning his corn at Melwood, but the Reds manager has made sure his fingerprints are all over the brand new complex as its grand opening draws ever nearer.</p>
      <p>This is a £50m investment that aims to shape and mould the future of the club for decades to come. Not bad for the price of a decent midfielder.</p>
      <p>How far does £50m stretch in 2019? Liverpool are making sure theirs goes a long, long way.</p>
