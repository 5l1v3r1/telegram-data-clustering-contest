      <h1>Gordon Sondland says Trump wanted ‘nothing’ from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky</h1>

      <p>Ambassador Gordon Sondland <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-gordon-sondlands-testimony/">testified under cross-examination</a> from Rep. Devin Nunes and staff counsel that President Trump told him during a September phone call that Trump “wanted nothing” from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>“President Trump, when I asked him the open-ended question, as I testified previously, ‘What do you want from Ukraine?’ His answer was, ‘I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.‘ That’s all I got from President Trump.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he knew that Rudy Giuliani was pushing the investigations on Trump’s behalf, he referred to his previous, closed-door testimony.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to dispute what I said in my deposition. I made the call and I asked as I said the open-ended question: ‘What do you want from Ukraine?’ That’s when I got the answer. He was unequivocal, ‘nothing.'”</p>
