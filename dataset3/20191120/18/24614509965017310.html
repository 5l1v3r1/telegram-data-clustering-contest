      <p>Junk bonds had a bad day yesterday.</p>

      <p>While the <b>S&amp;P 500</b> continued to levitate near all-time highs, the high-yield bond market got hit with some selling pressure. The <b>iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond Fund</b> (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hyg-stock-quote/"><b><u>HYG</u></b></a>) dropped 0.36%.</p>
      <p>Skeptics will scoff at that action. They’ll say HYG is up more than 12% for the year so far. A one-day loss of 0.36% is nothing.</p>
      <p>But… it could be a big deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.jeffclarktrader.com/market-minute/this-pattern-is-another-warning-sign-for-stocks/">The last time we looked at HYG</a>, we noted the chart had formed a bearish rising wedge pattern with negative divergence on the <a href="https://www.jeffclarktrader.com/glossary/#macd">MACD</a> and <a href="https://www.jeffclarktrader.com/glossary/#cci">CCI</a> momentum indicators.</p>
      <p>This pattern usually leads to a breakdown – which would mean a selloff in the high-yield bond market. And, a selloff in junk bonds usually leads to a decline in the broad stock market.</p>
      <p>Here’s an updated look at the chart I first showed you three weeks ago…</p>

      <p>For the past three weeks, HYG has been chopping back and forth in a tight trading range. It’s clinging just above the <a href="https://www.jeffclarktrader.com/glossary/#support">support line</a> of its rising wedge pattern.</p>
      <p>This choppy action has caused all of the various moving averages to coil together. So, there’s a lot of pent-up energy available to fuel a big move.</p>
      <p>And, it looks to me like that big move will be to the downside.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s 0.36% decline caused HYG to close below the support of all of its various moving averages. By itself, that’s not all that big of a deal. But, with HYG also threatening to break down from a bearish rising wedge pattern, yesterday’s decline could be an ominous warning for the junk bond sector.</p>
      <p>It looks to me that if HYG closes below $86.20 anytime over the next few sessions, then we’ll have a decisive breakdown from that pattern and junk bonds will be headed lower.</p>
      <p>And, if junk bonds head lower, then the stock market should follow close behind.</p>
      <p>Best regards and good trading,</p>
