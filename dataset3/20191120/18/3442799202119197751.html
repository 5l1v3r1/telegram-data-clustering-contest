      <h1>Apple Releases Smart Battery Case for iPhone 11 and 11 Pro with Dedicated Camera Button</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:21:07+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macstories.net/author/ryanchristoffel/" target="_blank">Ryan Christoffel</a></address>
      <p>Today Apple has launched new versions of its Smart Battery Case for the latest iPhone models, the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max, which are available to order now from the company’s website with November 25 delivery, which is the same date the case will be available in local stores.</p>
      <p>Like previous editions of the Smart Battery Case, the case’s exterior is made of silicone. There are three color options for the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max case: Pink Sand, White, and Black. The standard 11 case, however, is only available in Soft White and Black. All different versions of the Smart Battery Case are available at the same price: $129.</p>

      <p>Each version of the Smart Battery Case offers a quoted 50% longer battery life, making the already-excellent battery life of this year’s iPhones even better. They also all come with a new feature not available with any other previous case: a dedicated button for launching the camera, which sits on the lower-right side of the case.</p>
      <p>From the product listing:</p>
      <blockquote>The case features a dedicated camera button that launches the Camera app whether the iPhone is locked or unlocked. A quick press of the button takes a photo and a longer press captures QuickTake video. It works for selfies, too.</blockquote>
      <p>This is a very intriguing development, and one that’s particularly fitting for the iPhone 11 lineup due to its heavy emphasis on cameras. Now with the Smart Battery Case, you can shoot photos and videos for much longer than before without killing your battery, while also gaining more convenient access to the Camera app than is possible without the case.</p>
