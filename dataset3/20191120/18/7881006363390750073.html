      <p><b>Mumbai: </b>The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) annual general meeting is set to take place on December 1. And it is learnt that Laxman Sivaramakrishnan will replace MSK Prasad as BCCI’s head selector. The selection committee meeting that will take place on November 21 to decide India’s squad for the upcoming West Indies series will be Prasad’s last work.</p>
      <p>According to a report in The New Indian Express, the former spinner Sivaramakrishnan will head the panel after Prasad’s tenure comes to an end. This year was MSK Prasad’s last year as the chairman of BCCI’s selection panel. There have also been talks that the entire selection panel could be removed and replaced with a completely new one. The current selection panel has also faced constant criticism from various sectors regarding their failure to find a suitable No. 4 for India in the World Cup.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>According to rumours, other names on the candidates include Arshad Ayub and Venkatesh Prasad from South zone, Gyanendra Pandey from Central Zone, Ashish Nehra from North zone, Deep Dasgupta and Rohan Gavaskar from East Zone.</p>
      <p>There were, however, very few people to apply for the job, primarily due to the low amount of salary provided. There is also a possibility that salary of the selectors could be increased in the AGM in order to attract more candidates.</p>
      <p>The Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) will appoint the new chief selector and possibly a few changes will be done in the selection panel during the annual general meeting.</p>
      <p>It is also alleged that MSK Prasad is close to a luscious commentary deal in Telugu that he will join as soon as he is relieved of his duty.</p>
