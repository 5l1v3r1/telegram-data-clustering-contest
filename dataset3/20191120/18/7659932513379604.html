      <p>Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit condemned on Wednesday Iran for its official recognition of the Houthi militias and for transferring the Yemeni embassy in Tehran over to them.<br/><br/>This step is flagrant violation of diplomatic norms and blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, Vienna Convention and relevant Security Council resolutions, he said.<br/><br/>An official source at the Arab League said the move reflects Iranian “insistence in pursuing its hostile policy aimed at destabilizing Yemen, which will in turn threaten the security of its neighbors.”<br/><br/>The Arab League fully supports all legal and political measures the Yemeni government will take to counter Iran’s behavior, he added.<br/><br/>He stressed the importance of the UN Security Council assuming its responsibilities in this issue.</p>
