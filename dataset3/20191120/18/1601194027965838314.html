      <p>In one of the most awaited clashes of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/t10-cricket-league">T10 League 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/deccan-gladiators-cricket">Deccan Gladiators</a> face the defending champions, Northern Warriors in the final game on Thursday. The Warriors are in do or die situation. With two wins from five games, they need to get two points against a formidable Gladiators side to stay alive in the competition.</p>
      <p>It isn't as straight forward as it sounds with the Deccan Gladiators losing only one game so far in the competition. Both sides have a lot of firepower in their sides. While the Northern Warriors boasts of Andre Russell, Lendl Simmons and Nicolas Pooran in their ranks, Deccan Gladiators aren't light on resources with the duo of Kieron Pollard and Shane Watson donning the Gladiator jersey. Here are a few tips to help you pick your Dream11 team for NOR vs DEG.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Squads to choose from:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Northern Warriors:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Daren Sammy (C), Andre Russell, Sam Billings, George Munsey, Mark Deyal, Asela Gunaratne, Lendl Simmons, Nicholas Pooran, Sikander Raza, Chris Green, Ansh Tandon, Rayad Emrit, Nuwan Pradeep, Chris Wood, Pravin Tambe and Amir Hayat.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deccan Gladiators:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shane Watson (C), Anton Devcich, Mohammad Shahzad, Kieron Pollard, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Ben Cutting, Migael Pretorius, Fawad Ahmed, Zahir Khan, Mason Crane, Zahoor Khan, Tymal Mills, Prashant Gupta</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Playing XI Updates:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Northern Warriors:</b>
      </p>
      <p>No changes are expected from Northern Warriors for this pivotal game. Their top three of Lendl Simmons, Nicolas Pooran and Andre Russell hold all the aces with Sam Billings also capable of chipping in with a match-winning knock. Their bowling, however, will be expected to step up against the Gladiators with only Chris Green and Rayad Emrit putting inconsistent performances. The Warriors do look a batsman short and could possibly bring in Mark Deyal for Pradeep although it is highly unlikely for the aforementioned to happen.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: Pooran(WK), Simmons, Russell, Billings, Sammy(C), Green, Gunaratne, Emrit, Pradeep, Wood and Siddiqui.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deccan Gladiators:</b>
      </p>
      <p>As for the Gladiators, they should field an unchanged side with Shane Watson and Mohammad Shahzad opening the batting for them. While Kieron Pollard takes up the floaters role, Anton Devcich and Dan Lawrence's contributions are also equally valuable. Their bowling unit is heavily dependant on the spinners with Fawad Ahmed and Mason Crane bowling in different phases of an innings. Kieron Pollard and Ben Cutting should handle the sixth bowler duties as Deccan look to win this game and seal a place in the playoffs.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: Watson(C), Shahzad(WK), Pollard, Devcich, Bhanuka, Lawrence, Cutting, Fawad, Crane, Cottrell and Zahoor</p>

        <b>Match Details:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Northern Warriors vs Deccan Gladiators, Match 21</p>
      <p>21st November 2019, 9:30 PM IST</p>
      <p>Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Pitch Report:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The drizzles on Wednesday seems to have slowed the pitch down with considerable turn on offer for the spinners to exploit. Nevertheless, both teams would love to chase on this surface, on which 110 is par.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Fantasy Tips and Suggestions:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Wicket-keeper:</b> Nicolas Pooran is the second-highest run-scorer in T10 history with over 400 runs to his name. He should be able to score some runs for the Warriors as he is picked alongside Mohammad Shahzad. Mohd Shahzad is slowly finding his feet in the tournament and is a valuable asset to have in the side.</p>
      <p><b>Batsmen</b>: While West Indian, Lendl Simmons is a viable option from the Northern Warriors roster, the likes of Daniel Lawrence and Shane Watson have shown enough promise to warrant a place in the fantasy side. If one were to pick an extra Northern Warriors' batsman, Daren Sammy would suffice.</p>
      <p><b>Allrounders</b>: Andre Russell and Kieron Pollard are two of the most destructive batsmen in world cricket right now. Considering their ability to go berserk in the latter half of an innings, both of them are ideally picked in the side for this game. If credits are an issue, Chris Green and Anton Devcich are viable alternatives for the aforementioned duo.</p>
      <p><b>Bowlers:</b> Fawad Ahmed picked two wickets on Wednesday and seemed to enjoy the turn on offer. He is a great asset to any fantasy team along with Rayad Emrit. Sheldon Cottrell is also a wicket-taking option from the Gladiators roster who could be opted for in this game while one of Junaid Siddiqui or Chris Wood should suffice as well.</p>
      <p><b>Captain:</b> Nicolas Pooran is one of the most explosive players in the competition with a proven track record as well. He is the front-runner for captaincy for this game. Another such option would be Andre Russell with the burly West Indian expected to deliver with both bat and ball. Mohd Shahzad's form makes him a worth-while option as well for captaincy from the Deccan Gladiators roster.</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #1:</b> Nicolas Pooran, Mohd Shahzad, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Daniel Lawrence, Lendl Simmons, Andre Russell, Chris Green, Kieron Pollard, Rayad Emrit, Chris Wood and Sheldon Cottrell. Captain: Andre Russell, Vice-Captain: Mohd Shahzad</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #2:</b> Mohd Shahzad, Nicolas Pooran, Shane Watson, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Daniel Lawrence, Anton Devcich, Andre Russell, Sam Billings, Junaid Siddiqui, Fawad Ahmed and Rayad Emrit. Captain: Nicolas Pooran, Vice-Captain: Mohd Shahzad</p>
