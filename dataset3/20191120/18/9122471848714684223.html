      <h1>Coach O Has Update On When Veteran LB Michael Divinity Could Return To Team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:56:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Prior to LSU’s showdown with Alabama, senior linebacker Michael Divinity<a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/lsu-veteran-player-leaves-team-before-alabama-game"> left the team due to personal reasons</a>. He’s not set to return in the regular season, but Ed Orgeron did reveal the earliest possible date for his return.</p>
      <p>The loss of Divinity is a pretty significant blow for LSU’s defense, which has struggled in back-to-back games without him.</p>
      <p>Divinity had 22 tackles and three sacks this season for the Tigers. His best performances came against marquee opponents, such as Auburn and Texas.</p>
      <p>LSU is currently on track to play in the SEC Championship. Although the defense would benefit from having Divinity on the field for that game, Coach O made it clear that won’t happen.</p>
      <p>However, Orgeron said it’s possible that Divinity would be eligible to play in the national championship game</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/sports/lsu/article_ffc0c8c0-0baf-11ea-a0fc-afedf7e3fff7.html"><i>The Advocate</i></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Maybe he will be eligible for that,” Orgeron said on the Southeastern Conference coach’s teleconference. “Up until then, Mike will not be eligible to play.”</blockquote>
      <p>Orgeron didn’t fully commit to playing Divinity in a potential national title game, but he’ll cross that bridge if he gets there.</p>
      <p>At the very least, the LSU Tigers won’t have Divinity for two regular season games against Arkansas and Texas A&amp;M. He could also miss a conference championship game against Georgia and College Football Playoff semifinal.</p>
