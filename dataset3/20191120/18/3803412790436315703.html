Additionally, you'll find information on App Store Gift Card, AirPods, and the company's engraving service. There's also links for the Apple Card and Apple TV.</p>

      <p>Apple usually offers limited discounts on select products on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which are on November 29 and December 2, respectively, this year. Whatever the discounts, they should appear on the online gift guide at the appropriate times.</p>
      <p>Cupertino has lots of new products to highlight for 2019 as the year enters its final few weeks. Newbies include the iPhone 11 series, Apple AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro, new Macs and iPads, and much more.</p>
