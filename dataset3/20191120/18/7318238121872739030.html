      <p>The son of a former German president has been stabbed to death while delivering a lecture at a clinic in Berlin.</p>
      <p>Fritz von Weizsäcker, 59, was attacked on Tuesday evening by an audience member wielding a knife at the Schlosspark Clinic, where he was a head physician.</p>
      <p>A 33-year-old off-duty police officer who intervened was also seriously injured in the attack, Berlin police said in a statement, and was taken to hospital for treatment for non-life threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>His intervention, along with several audience members, eventually led to the arrest of the 57-year-old attacker, the statement added.</p>

      <p>The attacker was not previously known to police and was not believed to be a patient at the clinic. He is due to appear in court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.schlosspark-klinik.de/medizin-pflege/innere-medizin-i/chefarzt-von-weizsaecker.html">Weizsäcker</a>, who was an expert in gastroenterology, hepatology, oncology and infectiology, was delivering a lecture to around 20 people about liver fats when he was killed.</p>
      <p>He is also the son of the late German president Richard von Weizsäcker, who served in the role between 1984 and 1994, and died in 2015.</p>

      <p>In response to the attack, the spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was a "horrible blow", and expressed condolences to the family.</p>
      <p>"We don't know much about what happened here in Berlin last night,'' he said, adding: "It's a horrible blow to the von Weizsäcker family and the chancellor's condolences, and certainly also those of all the members of the government, go to the widow, to the entire family.''</p>

      <p>Germany's Free Democratic Party leader Christian Lindner said he was "stunned" by the death of his friend.</p>
      <p>Describing him as "a passionate doctor and a fine person", he wrote on Twitter: "Recently, he was at my home for a barbecue. I am stunned and must share my grief.</p>
      <p>"Once again, one asks oneself in which world we live."</p>
      <p>The victim's sister Beatrice also shared a post to social media, which simply said: "Take care of my brother" next to a picture of a Christian cross.</p>
