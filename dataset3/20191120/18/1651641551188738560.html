      <h1>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp introduces paid subscription service</h1>

      <p>
        <b>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, the Animal Crossing spin-off game for iOS and Android, is the latest game to add in an option for a paid monthly subscription service in the form of Pocket Camp Club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pocket Camp Club has two different plans in the form of the Happy Helper Plan and the Cookie &amp; Depot Plan.</p>
      <p>All Pocket Camp Club subscribers will gain access to a special journal that shows sneak peeks of upcoming items and will also enjoy significantly shorter item crafting times, regardless of which plan they choose. Both plans also come with 60 free Leaf Tickets (Pocket Camp’s premium in-game currency) each month.</p>

      <p>The Happy Helper Plan, priced at $2.99/month, allows you to choose a camper to work as a caretaker, meaning your camp will be taken care of even when you’re away. Your caretaker will do things such as help out with event quests and fulfil requests from animals visiting your camp.</p>
      <p>There’s a 1-month free trial available for the Happy Helper Plan for those who want to test it out but aren’t quite willing to shell out $2.99 to get an animal camper to essentially play the game for them.</p>

      <p>The Cookie &amp; Depot Plan is a little more glamorous, priced at $7.99 a month. Along with the perks of the Happy Helper Plan, this plan also allows players to access the brand new Cookie Shop where they can pick out five Fortune Cookies a month, some of which contain items that are exclusive to the Cookie Shop.</p>
      <p>Fortune Cookies contain exclusive items, such as furniture and clothing that can’t be acquired by normal crafting means. The Cookie &amp; Depot plan will include Cookies from previous events that have since been retired. Normally, players have to purchase Fortune Cookies with Leaf Tickets.</p>
      <p>This plan also gives players access to several warehouses, where they can store up to 5,000 items.</p>
      <p>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is currently down for maintenance until 10pm PST on November 20th. We can assume that, when it’s back online, the option to buy your way into Pocket Camp Club will be available.</p>
      <p>The game is free-to-play and can be picked up <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp/id1179915619">on the Apple App Store here</a> and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zaca&amp;hl=en_GB">the Google Play Store here</a>.</p>
      <p>In related Animal Crossing news, the next mainline instalment, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-for-switch-announced-at-e3-world-rejoices/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons, is set to release on Nintendo Switch on March 20th, 2020</a>.</p>
