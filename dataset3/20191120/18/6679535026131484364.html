      <p>The High Court has insisted that the government and the Travancore Devaswom Board ensure implementation of its order of July 23, 2018, pronouncing a complete ban on plastic, in whatever manner and whatever form, in Sabarimala and surrounding areas.</p>
      <p>In its order on November 13, the High Court Bench comprising C.T. Ravikumar and N. Nagesh, maintained that the “menace of plastic pollution continues even after such an order.”</p>
      <p>The judges were of the view that directions should be issued to the secretaries of all devaswom boards “to issue appropriate circulars to ensure that in temples where ‘kettunira’ is being performed, plastic articles or materials wrapped in plastic covers like sachets, wraps, covers, etc. shall be cut open and the contents therein transferred to eco-friendly covers or paper covers before putting in the Irumudikkettu.”</p>
      <p>The court order of July last had banned plastic bottles, sachets, wraps, drinking straw, covers, or any other, including plastic sachets for carrying puja articles in the Irumudikkettu.</p>
