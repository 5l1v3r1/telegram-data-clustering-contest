      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Raytheon Missile System in Tucson has been awarded an $84 million contract for support on the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile Block 2's production requirements.</p>
      <p>The contract, announced Tuesday by the Department of Defense, will allow Raytheon to procure the remaining materials in support of the ESSM fiscal year 2020 low rate initial production Lot 3 all up rounds and spares.</p>
      <p>The Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile can be launched from surface ships to destroy threats that include high speed anti-ship cruise missiles, low velocity air threats, high-diving threats and surface-based targets.</p>
      <p>The Navy will obligate the full value of the contract at the time of the award, which will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The bulk of work on this project will be performed in Tucson, with other work executed at sites across North America, Europe and Australia.</p>
      <p>This contract modification was not competitively procured, per a U.S. government contracts code clause exempting the government from awarding contracts competitively when the terms of an international agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government requires the use of non-competitive procedures.</p>
