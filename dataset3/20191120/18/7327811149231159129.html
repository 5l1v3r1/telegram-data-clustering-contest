      <p>A studio executive once suggested Julia Roberts should play Harriet Tubman in a film about the anti-slavery crusader.</p>
      <p>The movie "Harriet" which came out last month stars actress Cynthia Erivo.</p>
      <p>The conversation happened 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>The movie's script writer, Gregory Allen Howard, said one studio head said, "This script is fantastic. Let's get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman."</p>
      <p>When someone pointed out that Roberts couldn't be Harriet, the executive responded, "It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference."</p>
      <p>When talking about the episode, Allen said the climate in Hollywood was very different 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>Allen told the story in an interview posted by Focus Features, the Studio behind "Harriet."</p>
