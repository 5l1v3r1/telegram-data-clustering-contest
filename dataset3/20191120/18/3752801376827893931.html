      <p>Pupils who were expelled from St Francis College in Marriannhill, KwaZulu-Natal, have been reinstated following an urgent intervention and arbitration by Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu, the provincial Department of Education has said. </p>
      <p>They were expelled after being accused of contravening the school's code of conduct.</p>
      <p>According to the department, 13 pupils were initially expelled and nine have been reinstated. </p>
      <p>Mshengu intervened in the matter between the independent school and parents.   </p>
      <p>"We are glad that these learners have been accepted back in the school set-up. In the meantime, we will assist the affected learners by having them undergo corrective and support programmes so that they can be rehabilitated," he said. </p>
      <p>Mshengu added people deserve a second chance, saying the department had a strong belief that schools could help in transforming society and ensuring that these future citizens develop self-discipline and a sense of self-worth.</p>
      <p>"It is therefore vital that all schools take a positive approach to the issue of conduct and discipline."</p>
