      <p>Vanhelleputte had paid a courtesy call to the Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga to hand over 200 pieces of the kit for the legislators.<br/> <br/>The marathon has in recent years according to organisers consistently attracted over 20,000 participants. This is, however, the first time that MTN officially come out to state that 25,000 kits have been sold.<br/> <br/>This is a huge improvement from 1500 entrants in the inaugural edition of the annual event.</p>
