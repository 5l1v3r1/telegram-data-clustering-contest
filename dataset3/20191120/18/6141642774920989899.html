      <p>Virtual reality may be able to transport our sight and sound senses to new heights but one area it has failed to immerse us in is the power of touch.</p>
      <p>Scientists in the US have developed a prototype device which aims to put this third sense within VR’s reach, using a flexible material fitted with tiny vibrating components that can be attached to skin.</p>
      <p>But researchers from Northwestern University believe the system, known as epidermal VR, could be useful in other cases as well, from a child touching a display relaying the gesture to a family member located elsewhere, to helping people with amputations renew their sense of touch.</p>
      <p>In gaming, it could alert players when a strike occurs on the corresponding body part of the game character.</p>
      <blockquote>It could be very powerful for social interactions, clinical medicine and applications that we cannot conceive of today, beyond the obvious opportunities in gaming and entertainment<cite>Professor John A Rogers</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“Virtual reality is a very important emerging area of technology,” said Professor John A Rogers, who worked on the project.</p>
      <p>“Currently, we’re just using our eyes and our ears as the basis for those experiences.</p>
      <p>“The community has been comparatively slow to exploit the body’s largest organ: the skin. Our sense of touch provides the most profound, deepest emotional connection between people.”</p>
      <p>The team’s design features 32 vibrating actuators on a thin 15cm by 15cm silicone polymer which sticks on to the skin without tape or straps and is free of large batteries and wires.</p>
      <p>It uses near-field communication (NFC) technology – which is used in many smartphones for mobile payment today – to transfer the data.</p>

      <p>“With this wireless power delivery scheme, we completely avoid the need for batteries, with their weight, size, bulk and limited operating lifetimes.</p>
      <p>“The result is a thin, lightweight system that can be worn and used without constraint indefinitely.”</p>
      <p>Scientists hope that the technology could eventually find its way into clothing, allowing people with prosthetics to wear VR shirts that communicate touch through their fingertips.</p>
      <p>Their research is published in the Nature journal.</p>
