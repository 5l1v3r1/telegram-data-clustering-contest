      <h1>Next Star Wars Movie Announcement Expected to Arrive in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:11:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Math Erao</a></address>
      <p>Lucasfilm already has a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> film planned for release in 2022, but don't expect to hear anything about it until next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-uncertainty-extends-kathleen-kennedys-disney-future-1256357">The Hollywood Reporter</a> has a massive profile on Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, which dives deep into the continued future she'll have as the head of one of media's most successful franchises. While the piece is full of interesting news regarding the universe, perhaps the biggest reveal is that 2022 will see the next <i>Star Wars</i> film hit theaters. According to the report, Kennedy even has a director attached to the film. That said, an announcement reportedly won't arrive until January 2020.</p>

      <p>The article notes that this new film will not be part of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/rian-johnson-hopes-star-wars-trilogy-still-happening/">Rian Johnson's planned trilogy</a>. Beyond that, we can only speculate about what it will mean for <i>Star Wars</i> and who will be helming. What we do know is <a href="https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-season-8-deleted-scenes-daenerys/amp/">Game of Thrones</a> showrunners <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-game-of-thrones-creators-depart-planned-trilogy/">D.B. Weiss and David Benioff</a> are no longer attached to their own planned trilogy. Of course, the 2022 film could still be based around the same concept, which will apparently delve into the Old Republic and its storied place in <i>Star Wars</i> history.</p>
      <p>Beyond that possibility, we know MCU architect <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvel-studios-president-kevin-feige-developing-star-wars-film/">Kevin Feige will be producing a film</a> in the galaxy far, far away, something that's been a dream of his since childhood. Though he's unlikely to direct, the upcoming film could be the one he's in charge of, as Disney may be eager for Feige to work his magic sooner rather than later.</p>

      <p>The same piece also revealed <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-jon-favreau-influence-increase/">Jon Favreau will have an increased role</a> in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. With his series <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian/">The Mandalorian</a> clearly a hit, it's possible he could be directing the new film. After all, he's already helmed both Marvel and Disney movies and now has his own <i>Star Wars</i> project.</p>
      <p>While they await 2020 and what news it brings, <i>Star Wars</i> fans will have plenty to hold them over, as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">The Rise of Skywalker</a> is right around the corner. And before we know it, January will be here.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives December 20, 2019.</p>
