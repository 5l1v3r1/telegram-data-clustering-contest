      <p>uBlock Origin on Firefox can now block first-party tracking scripts that attempt to bypass filters and rules by utilizing DNS CNAME records to load scripts from a third-party domain.</p>
      <p>A first-party tracker is when the tracking script is located on the same domain as the web site, while a third-party tracker is when the tracking script is located on another domain.</p>
      <p>As browsers begin to block third-party trackers as part of their tracking protection features, some web sites have switched to first-party trackers in order to bypass these protections.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780">new issue</a> posted to the uBlock Origin ad blocker's GitHub issues page, a user posted a new issue about a web site loading tracking scripts from a subdomain of the site, which makes it look like a first-party tracker.</p>
      <p>According to the user, though, this subdomain was actually a DNS CNAME record that resolves to a different domain that provide tracking services.</p>
      <p>As uBlock Origin is seeing these as a first party tracking scripts being loaded from the website's domain, it does not block them and allows them to run.</p>
      <h3>First-party tracker protection only available in Firefox</h3>
      <p>In order to block first-party trackers that utilize CNAME records, uBlock Origin would first need to perform a DNS lookup of the hostname loading a script  to determine the underlying domain that it resolves to.</p>
      <p>For example, if a script is being loaded from the user's domain, the ad blocker will perform a DNS lookup and check if it resolves to known tracking domains, and if so, block them.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Chrome does not provide an API that allows an extension to perform DNS lookups, but uBlock Origin developer Raymond Hill <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780#issuecomment-552465524">was able to find</a> an API in Firefox that could perform this function.</p>
      <p>"I am looking at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns/resolve">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns/resolve</a>, it can be used to expose the CNAME:"</p>
      <p>Hill later <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.24.1b1">released uBlock Origin 1.24.1b0</a> that <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780">contains a new feature</a> that will "uncloak" CNAME records in order to block first-party tracking that utilizes scripts on third-party domains.</p>
      <p>"If using 1.24.1b0 and above, to "uncloak" actual (canonical, CNAME) hostname, set advanced setting <code>cnameAliasList</code> to <code>*</code>.</p>
      <p>Network requests for which the actual hostname differs from the original hostname will be replayed through uBO's filtering engine using the actual hostname. When I started developing the feature I could spot <code>eulerian.net</code> in the logger when visiting <code>https://www.liberation.fr/</code>, but I can no longer reproduce this. Regardless, uBO is now equipped to deal with 3rd-party disguised as 1st-party as far as Firefox's <code>browser.dns</code> allows it."</p>
      <p>With this new feature added, if using uBlock Origin version 1.24.1b0 or newer, when installing the extension it will require a new DNS permission described as "Access IP address and hostname information", which will be used by the extension resolve the CNAME records.</p>

      <p>Users can then enable this feature by following these steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Go into the extension's <b>Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>Put a checkmark in the "<b>I am an advanced user (required reading</b>)" checkbox and click on the  icon.</li>
        <li>When the Advanced settings page opens, find the <b>cnameAliasList </b>setting and change it from '<b>unset</b>' to '<b>*</b>'.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When finished making the changes, it should look like the image below.</p>

      <p>With this new setting enabled, any first-party trackers that use CNAMES to third-party domains will be unmasked and blocked.</p>
