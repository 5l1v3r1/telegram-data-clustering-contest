      <p>This holiday season, you may be called upon to give a gift to someone at work, your family, friends or loved ones. Instead of doing the regular gift buying, consider some craft beer from the Pacific Northwest for a different flavor.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Tavour:</b>
      </p>
      <p>For those looking for a gift that highlights the craft beer culture at it’s finest consider a <a href="https://gifts.tavour.com/">gift box</a> from Tavour. This company based in Washington State has developed a reputation as a go to place for securing hard-to-find craft beer from not only Washington State and Oregon but also 45 other states. Every beer they sell is a certified independent beer, so consumers know they are getting beer brewed by small producers and artisans. Furthermore, thanks to Tavour’s ongoing relationships with craft brewers, they can access seasonal beers and other unique offerings as soon as they are released.</p>

        <b>Merchandise: Holiday Gifts from Pacific Northwest Breweries</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another holiday option is to select a gift of beer merchandise. For example, celebrate Seattle based Pike Brewing’s 30th anniversary by purchasing a Pike flannel shirt, Pike beanie, or one of their other signature items. Also, <a href="http://store.pfriembeer.com/">Pfriem Beer</a> based out of Hood River, Oregon offers stylish bottle openers, T-shirts, and signature glasses that can be shipped anywhere, as well as bottles of their signature beers that can be sent to those living in Oregon.</p>

        <b>Celebrating with Beer Events:</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the gift recipient will be visiting the Pacific Northwest, consider showering them with tickets to one of the many holiday and post-holiday beer festivals happening in the area.
