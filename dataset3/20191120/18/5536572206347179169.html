      <h1>RUMOR: Philip Rivers Would “Love” To Play For The Titans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:18:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Philip Rivers is having a really bad 2019 campaign that might turn out to be his final season for the only franchise that he has ever known.</p>
      <p>The Chargers legend has thrown 14 interceptions so far this season, and that includes 7 within the last two games. After losing to the Kansas City Chiefs in Mexico City, the team has now dropped to 4-7 and their playoff hopes are dying by the week.</p>
      <p>Rivers is set to become a free agent after this season, and all signs are pointing to the team not bringing him back, which has now started the rumor mill of where he might end up.</p>
      <p>According to a report by Matt Miller of Bleacher Report — Rivers would “love” to join the Titans.</p>

      <p>Rivers, who will turn 38 in December, is amidst his 16th NFL season and has spent every moment of his career with the Chargers after he was traded from the Giants for Eli Manning on the day of the 2004 NFL Draft.</p>
      <p>With Marcus Mariota falling out of favor in Tennessee, there just might be a spot for Rivers if the franchise looks at him the way he reportedly looks at them.</p>
