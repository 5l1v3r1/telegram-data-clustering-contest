      <h2>Witnesses claimed the London station was overcrowded but the British Transport Police have said the rush hour incident is not being treated as suspicious as the man remains in hospital</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:06:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p>A man in a critical condition after being struck by a Tube train suffered a "medical episode" before he fell onto the tracks in front of horrified commuters, police believe.</p>
      <p>The man is in a critical but stable condition and has been taken to a major trauma centre with serious leg injuries, emergency services have now said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/british-transport-police">British Transport Police</a> were at the scene along with paramedics treating the injured man at London's Oxford Circus Tube station which was evacuated and closed at rush hour.</p>
      <p>Witnesses claimed the station was 'overcrowded' with one saying people were 'pushing and shoving each other'.</p>
      <p>The incident happened at around 5.35pm, the busiest time for commuters.</p>
      <p>Photos from the scene showed huge crowds building outside the popular central London station.</p>

      <p>BTP said the incident is not being treated as suspicious.</p>
      <p>Former England cricketer Ebony Rainford-Brent said she witnessed a man fall under a train right in front of her.</p>
      <p>Documenting what she saw in a series of tweets, she wrote: "1. I cannot believe what I have just witnessed. Absolutely horric scenes at Oxford Circus and I just watched a man fall under the tube 2m in front of me. @TfL this is UNACCEPTABLE that in one of the most sophisticated cities in the world stations are allowed to get this RAMMED. (sic)</p>

      <p>"2. People pushing &amp; shoving each other &amp; putting life at risk just trying to get home from work. @TfL something needs to be DONE URGENTLY to create safety. Sending prayers out to the family &amp; friends of the young man, some horrible conversations to be had. Still shaking. So sad."</p>
      <p>She added: "For clarity it was overcrowded and not managed at all."</p>
      <p>Ms Rainford-Brent told the PA News Agency the platform was the "most packed" she had ever seen in her 35 years living in London.</p>

      <p>A Londoner wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>: "Was just leaving the platform at #oxfordcircus and suddenly people start screaming/ crying and running towards me."</p>
      <p>One commuter warned people to avoid the station saying there were "lots of police around".</p>
      <p>Another said he didn't see what happened but was on the platform at the time and heard calls for doctors.</p>
      <p>He added: "Huge number of ambulances and emergency services now."</p>
