      <p>A fire burnt down over a dozen shops in New Rajdhahi Supermarket in the capital’s Tikatuli yesterday.</p>
      <p>The fire began at a mattress store on the first floor of the two-storey market around 5:15pm, officials said.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five fire engines were deployed to douse the fire.</p>
      <p>Director General of the Fire Service and Civil Defence Brig Gen Sajjad Hossain said 14-15 shops were burnt down and 2-3 other shops were partially damaged. The fire was extinguished around 6:45pm.</p>

      <p>However, several shop-owners and witnesses claimed that around 50-60 shops on the first floor had been gutted.</p>
      <p>A committee will be formed to find the cause of the fire and how much damage had been done, the DG told reporters at the scene.</p>
      <p>The market, built with corrugated-iron sheets, was listed as a risky establishment and fire officials conducted a fire drill around a month ago, the DG said.</p>
      <p>He added that they had asked the market authorities to improve safety in two months.</p>
      <p>The market houses around 170 stores.</p>
      <p>Russell, a shopkeeper at a mattress store, claimed that sparks from a welding work being done close to his store caused curtains and mattresses in his store to ignite.</p>
      <p>He claimed that they used fire extinguishers but could not supress the fire. People then ran out of the market. At least five other witnesses gave similar accounts.</p>
      <p>Three people suffered minor injuries and took treatment at hospitals.</p>
      <p>Power connection to the area was cut and nearby roads were closed to traffic until the fire was put out.</p>
      <p>Babul, owner of Faisal Bedding Store on the first floor, said he just bought blankets worth Tk 10 lakh for sale in winter.</p>
      <p>“Everything has been gutted,” Babul said, adding that he had lost goods worth Tk 30 lakh in total.</p>
