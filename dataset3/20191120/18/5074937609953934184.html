      <h1>Increase nutrition services at the district level - GTLC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:34:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author">Fatima Anafu-Astanga, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Bolgatanga, Nov. 19, GNA - Mr Emmanuel Wullingdool, a Policy Officer at the Ghana Trade and Livelihood Coalition (GTLC), has said there is the need for increased nutrition service delivery at the district level, to ensure that children get the right nutrition at all times.</p>
      <p>The Policy Officer also called on district assemblies to intensify efforts at promoting nutrition related services under their medium term development plans and adequately budget for it to foster good health and the wellbeing of children.</p>
      <p>Mr Wullingdool, who made the call in an interview with the Ghana News Agency in Bolgatanga, said nutrition service delivery is crucial in ensuring that problems of malnutrition in communities are addressed.</p>
      <p>He said the key role of stakeholders in health delivery such as the Ghana Health Service (GHS) in the curative aspect of malnutrition is important and required all the needed logistics to attain desired results.</p>
      <p>“When a child is malnourished it is a case of concern, since the cognitive ability of the child is likely to be affected and can retard the child’s education”, he said.</p>
      <p>Malnutrition goes beyond a health issue and a multi-sectorial effort is required for the various actors in health and nutrition to be effective, he said, and called on district assemblies to play key roles to promote the preventive aspect.</p>
      <p>GLTC is a CSO partner of the SNV under the voice for Change (V4C) programme which is an evidence based advocacy programme implemented by SNV in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p>The emphasis of the partnership is on sustainable nutrition, ensuring gender and nutrition sensitive value chains, post-harvest losses and food safety for all.</p>
      <p>To this end, GTLC since 2016, has been facilitating community nutrition committees in the Upper East and Upper West Regions to work and exchange information on preventive and curative measures in malnutrition are as well as collaborate and coordinate with district assemblies, in the area of nutrition sensitive activities.</p>
      <p>GTLC has been influential in the formation of nutrition sub–committees in Poyentenga in Wa West, to address acute malnutrition and is currently working with some CSOs especially the Talensi Women Development Association in the Talensi District in the Upper East Region.</p>
      <p>The project is expected to contribute to ensuring sustainable nutrition for all through the reduction in Post- Harvest Losses in the district.</p>
