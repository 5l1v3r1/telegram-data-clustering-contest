      <h1>Woman died of sepsis after 'being denied antibiotics', inquest hears</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:59:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/mason-boycott-owen/" target="_blank">Mason Boycott-Owen</a></address>
      <p>A HR director who died of sepsis after being denied antibiotics was stuck outside a hospital in an ambulance for almost three hours, an inquest has heard.</p>
      <p>Samantha Brousas, 49, from Gresford in Wales died on 23 February last year, two days after being admitted to Wrexham Maelor Hospital.</p>
      <p>Ms Brousas’ daughter, Sophie, a fourth-year medical student, told the inquest that she saw her mother in the ambulance outside the hospital where she was refused antibiotics.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard how paramedics had told Me Brousas' daughter that they could not administer antibiotics in the ambulance, despite asking whether her mother had sepsis and if she should be given the medication.</p>
      <p>She said that “No-one from the hospital came out to see her in the ambulance", but that she trusted the paramedics because they were professionals.</p>
      <p>When Ms Brousas was admitted to A&amp;E it took a further hour before she was administered antibiotics, before being transferred to an intensive care unit there she died less than 48 hours later from septic shock and multiple organ failure.</p>
      <p>Her partner, Simon Goacher, told the hearing in Ruthin, North Wales, that both he and his partner had common cold symptoms over the New Year period.</p>
      <p>When Ms Brousas’ condition did not improve, she was prescribed a medical inhaler, but continued to feel ill.</p>
      <p>The assistant coroner Joanne Lees was told that on 20th February, one day before she was admitted to hospital, Ms Brousas attended a GP appointment with Dr Greetha Bala where she was told she had viral gastroenteritis and that she was not going to die.</p>
      <p>Official NHS advice states that a patient should be administered antibiotics within an hour of arriving at a hospital, however Ms Brousas waited around four times that before being given the life-saving medication.</p>
      <p>A nurse at the practice, told the court that Ms Brousas' symptoms did not trigger an automated sepsis warning on the NHS computer system.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that new technology can help some patients get antibiotics quicker. Yesterday the Telegraph reported on NHS trials for sepsis alert systems that could potentially save thousands of lives.</p>
      <p>Sepsis happens when the body’s immune system damages tissues and organs as it responds to infection in the body.</p>
      <p>The mortality rate for sepsis patients in hospitals is around 18 per cent and accounts for around 48,000 deaths in the UK every year.</p>
      <p>Ms Brousas’ daughter, Sophie, will be running a half marathon to raise money for the UK Sepsis Trust, which raises awareness around the condition.</p>
      <p>The inquest, listed for four days, continues.</p>
