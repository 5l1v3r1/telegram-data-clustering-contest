        <b>Dundalk FC have announced the signing of England underage international Will Patching on a two-year deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Manchester City academy graduate was most recently at Notts County, who were relegated to non-league last term, although Patching does come with a strong reputation having played for his country 25 times at juvenile level, including at the 2015 U17 World Cup.</p>
      <p>There, he lined out alongside Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, among other high profile players.</p>
      <p>Dundalk's second signing of the off season, following the capture of Greg Sloggett, 21-year-old Patching said: "It’s a great feeling to be at the club.</p>
      <p>"It happened all in the last week, I met Vinny and have been impressed with everything. It has been good and I am glad to be here. The facilities are great and it seems like a good place to play. I have done my research on the club and we have been very successful.</p>

      <p>"I am a player who loves to score goals, assist and play high up the pitch. I am hoping to bring that to the team.</p>
      <p>“I want to win trophies here, that is what I have come here to do. I want to do well in Europe. That is a big thing for me.</p>
      <p>"I know that the club got to the group stages of the Europa League a few years ago and the aim is to get back there. I want to be successful and win everything while I am here.”</p>
      <p>His new head coach, Vinny Perth, added: "We are delighted to finally get Will to the club.  </p>
      <p>"We have been working on this one for a while. Will has had a Rolls Royce upbringing in football. He has been at the very best club in Manchester City. He has been capped underage at England.</p>
      <p>"We feel he may have lost his way a bit in the last year in the game. The final part of his development as a footballer is learning how to play men’s football and becoming a man on the football pitch.</p>
      <p>"A certain amount of that has been done at Notts County where we have watched a lot of his football and we have been very impressed with what we have seen. We believe we are signing a player with huge potential. We believe he can become a real star.</p>
      <p>“The challenge is ultimately up to Will to become a top player. We believe that for the development of him as a player he has come to the right club. At 21 years of age, he is a vastly experienced young player. The future is bright. The hard work for him starts now but we believe in him.</p>
      <p>“Supporters should expect a talented, attack minding footballer who has magic in his feet. With the right fitness level and the right understanding of the game, he will be a real asset to the squad. We look forward to working with him and he is one for the future. He has a bit of work to do and we have a bit of work to do but we believe he is at the right club to make it happen."</p>
