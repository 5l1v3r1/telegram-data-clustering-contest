        <b>A young woman has spoken out about having a large part of her skull removed after being knocked down in a hit and run.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Steph Blake, 22, was in a coma for 19 days following the accident, and suffered swelling on the brain. Her condition forced doctors to make the decision to remove a large part of her skull from the top of her head.</p>
      <p>Over a year on, Steph, from Totton, Hampshire, has bravely released her X-ray images as part of Road Safety Week, with the hopes of spreading awareness of the ‘massive’ consequences of failing to drive carefully.</p>

      <p>Sadly, Steph’s dreams of working as a cabin crew member were dashed on account of her injuries, and she was unable to take up a position offered to her by EasyJet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Steph said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The past year or so has been the most difficult of my life and the incident has affected me in so many ways. I was devastated that I couldn’t take up my cabin crew job and it is difficult not to think about how things could have been different.<br/><br/>However, I have to remember that I’m lucky to be alive. I’m determined to look to the future and move forward with my life.<br/><br/>Nothing will change what has happened, but I just want to encourage people to always be careful on the road. Failing to do so can have massive consequences.</blockquote>
      <p>The incident occurred on the morning of June, 22, 2018, when Steph was waiting for a green man before crossing the A35 in Totton.</p>
      <p>After the lights changed, Steph stepped out onto the road. However, while one lane of traffic had stopped, a car in the second lane had not.</p>

        <b>Steph said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I remember the cars had stopped and the lane being empty, then I remember a car at my left hip.<br/><br/>I can also remember laying on the ground and think I have memory of people coming to help. After that there is just nothing.<br/><br/>The next thing I recall is waking up in hospital and seeing my Dad.</blockquote>
      <p>After being rushed to Southampton General Hospital, Steph was admitted to Wessex Neurological Unit. As well as the six-hour surgery to remove part of her skull, Steph’s traumatic injuries have since required two further operations.</p>
      <p>Since the incident, Steph has thankfully made progress. However, she still has to contend with issues such as fatigue, memory loss and concentration, as well as some behavioural issues.</p>
