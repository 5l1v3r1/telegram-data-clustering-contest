      <p>MNP and an Okanagan accounting firm are joining forces.</p>
      <p>Chun and Co., which is based in Kelowna, will be merging with MNP in February.</p>
      <p>MNP is the fifth largest national accounting and business consulting firm in Canada, and it was looking to expand its Okanagan presence.</p>
      <p>Chun and Co., meanwhile, was seeking to deliver more specialty services to its clients.</p>
      <p>“Changing market conditions are impacting the way businesses must operate,” Dan Chun said in a press release. “As such, we are continually looking at new ways to enhance our service offerings and help our clients achieve their goals. By joining MNP, we add more resources, more specialized services and a wider range of experiences, all of which will bring greater value to our clients."</p>
