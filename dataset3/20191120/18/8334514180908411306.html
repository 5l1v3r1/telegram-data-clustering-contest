      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) on Wednesday said it would ask its members whether they wanted to back a coalition government deal between the Socialists and the left-wing Unidas Podemos.</p>
      <p>The left-wing separatist ERC, which could act as a kingmaker in the formation of a new government, plans to clarify its position based on the response of grassroots members.</p>
      <p>The binding consultation, which will be held on November 25, hinges on whether acting prime minister Pedro Sanchez will engage in dialogue over the issue of Catalan independence.</p>
      <p>In a convoluted question, ERC is asking its members: “Do you agree with rejecting the investiture of Sanchez if previously there has not been an agreement to address the political conflict with the (Spanish) State around a negotiating table?”</p>
      <p>Sanchez won an election earlier in November. But his 120 seats, combined with the 35 won by Podemos, leave them short of a majority in the 350-seat parliament, meaning the 13 elected lawmakers of the ERC party could play a key role in unblocking the political stalemate in Madrid.</p>
      <p>The separatist party told Reuters last week its support in parliament is conditional on receiving an offer of dialogue on Catalan independence.</p>
      <p>Catalonia’s independence drive loomed large over the election campaign, after anger at long jail sentences for nine separatist leaders sparked protests - at times violent - and prompted national parties, including the Socialists, to harden their stance on Spain’s most economically important region.</p>
