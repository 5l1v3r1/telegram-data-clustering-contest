      <p>A suspected drug peddler was killed in a “gunfight” with members of Rapid Action Battalion in Hazaribagh area of the capital early yesterday.</p>
      <p>The dead -- Nadim Bahadur, 38 -- is a listed drug dealer and accused in nine cases, Rab claimed in a short message circulated to journalists. </p>
      <p>Sajid Mia, deputy assistant director of Rab-2, told The Daily Star that one of their teams came across two men on a motorbike around 4:00am near Sikder Medical College Hospital in Hazaribagh.</p>
      <p>As soon as the Rab team signalled the motorbike to stop, the duo opened fire on them, forcing the law enforcers to retaliate, he claimed.</p>
      <p>At one point of the “gunfight”, Nadim was shot and another unknown person managed to flee. Nadim was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) where doctors declared him dead, the Rab official added.</p>
      <p>Rab confirmed the identity of the dead from a national identity card found with him.</p>
      <p>The elite force also claimed to have seized a motorcycle and recovered a pistol along with few bullets, 35 bottles of phensidyl, and 180 pieces of yaba.</p>
      <p>The body was sent to DMCH morgue for autopsy.</p>
