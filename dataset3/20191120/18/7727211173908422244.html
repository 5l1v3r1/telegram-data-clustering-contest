      <h2>Liverpool legend John Aldridge looks ahead to the Reds resuming their Premier League campaign with a testing trip to Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:01:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/john-aldridge-le/" target="_blank">John Aldridge</a></address>
      <p>It will be a tough test for Liverpool when the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> resumes for us at Selhurst Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/roy-hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a> is a nice man, unfortunately his time at Anfield didn't have any inspiration with all due respect and I mean that.</p>
      <p>It was the wrong place at the wrong time with the Hicks and Gillett era coming to an end and it was always going to be difficult dealing with them.</p>
      <p>He did his best but we weren't seeing the kind of football that we like.</p>
      <p>Wherever Roy's been though he's given it everything and he is very passionate about the game.</p>

      <p>I totally respect the man and you can guarantee he'll set up his team to try and do a job on us.</p>
      <p>I still can't believe how few clean sheets we've had this season, it's drove us mad!</p>
      <p>That the lads have been still able to keep getting results week-in, week-out says everything about them but, as a manager, as grateful as you are when the lads are digging it out like that, clean sheets are your bread and butter and the sooner we get back to notching them up regularly the better.</p>
      <p>There's no better place to start than Palace, they've got some good players and Zaha is always a handful and they've got a few players who can get hurt you going forward but you can get at them.</p>
      <p>Let's have it right, we can get at anyone, we just put three past City!</p>
      <p>We've just got to make sure we don't keep going behind as we have a few times recently, you can't keep fighting back all of the time even though our lads seem to be determined to prove that theory wrong this season!</p>
      <p>It would be nice to go there and have a lovely one or two nil-er and see it out with a bit of comfort but it is a tough place to go.</p>
      <p>They're very fervent the Palace fans, Selhurst is one of my favourite grounds to go to if I'm honest, it's very old-fashioned and rowdy and they probably generate the best atmosphere in London.</p>
      <p>They're really good honest fans and will definitely be up for it but so will our lads.</p>
      <p>We just have to hope everyone comes back fit from international duty and then go for it so we can keep this brilliant run going.</p>
