      <p><i>“<b>I tested the most important things yesterday</b>”,</i> <b>starts Andrea Dovizioso, having completed day two of testing at Valencia.</b> Yesterday, Dovi was able to get a taste of the GP20, finding the right confidence with the new bike and trying to understand the positives.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So what did today's work involve?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I had to try other things and make some decisions, because the season starts soon and we need to define certain things. I haven't made any frame comparisons today". </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>On Monday and Tuesday, you have another two-day test at Jerez, what are the key things to work on there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We need to better understand everything I tested yesterday. <b>I hope conditions are good at Jerez</b> because that track can tell us more about the new material”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Are they important days?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“In MotoGP, testing should be taken with a pinch of salt, particularly the end of season tests. There are some who want to push and others who don't, it's not a race weekend where everyone's doing their best. I don't think it's important to push too much during these days". </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Yet we've seen some great lap times. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Yes, but <b>you need to understand what everyone else tested and what tyres they used for those laps, it's all relative</b>”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>All three of you have tested the new bike (Dovi, Petrucci and Miller). Have you talked?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“<b>All our feedback was the same </b>and is very positive”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Did Petrucci's limited work due to injury condition your work?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“No, <b>I had a clear programme and stuck to it. It's always best to test everything properly, in the right way"</b>. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>And the 2020 Michelin tyres? You didn't like them at Phillip Island. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Yes, I tested the front today, and <b>confirm what I said at Phillip Island”</b>. </i>
