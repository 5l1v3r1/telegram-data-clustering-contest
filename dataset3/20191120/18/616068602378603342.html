      <p>Social media users are hailing Greta Thunberg the time traveller sent 'to save us' after a photo emerged of her Canadian lookalike from 1898.</p>
      <p>The black and white photo taken 121 years ago shows three children at a gold mine in the Yukon, one of whom bears an uncanny resemblance to the 16-year-old climate change activist – even featuring her signature hairstyle. </p>
      <p>After being dug up from the University of Washington’s archives, the image has brought out conspiracy theorists in droves. </p>
      <p>One Twitter user said: "What it is, right, is that actually she’s a time traveller, and she’s come to warn us about the future. It’s the only explanation."</p>
      <p>Another asked: “How many times does time-travelling #GretaThunberg need to show up to warn humanity before we heed her advice and do the right thing – for the sake of both ourselves and the planet?”</p>
      <p>Others were more concerned with a different aspect of the viral photo. </p>
      <p>“Everyone is talking about #GretaThunberg being a @timetraveler. I’m way more concerned with this creepy dog.”</p>
      <p>Thunberg took the UN by storm earlier this year when she gave an impassioned speech on the responsibility of leaders to act on climate change. </p>
      <p>"We will not let you get away with this," she said. "Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not."</p>
