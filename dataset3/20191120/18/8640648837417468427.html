      <h1>NFR Express bus service includes Convention Center, 24 hotels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:21:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a></address>
      <p>Rodeo fans looking for transportation to and from the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo will have the option to utilize the complimentary shuttle bus service — the NFR Express — with routes from the Las Vegas Convention Center and NFR official host hotels on the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown to the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.</p>
      <p>From Thursday, Dec. 5 through Saturday, Dec. 14, shuttle buses will pick up at Cowboy Christmas at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The one-way route will serve as the Rodeo Express Shuttle and will run from the Las Vegas Convention Center South Hall directly to the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.</p>
      <p>Also beginning on Dec. 5, the NFR Express will begin complimentary routes to and from the NFR sponsor hotels. There are 14 routes, covering 24 hotel properties.</p>
      <p>“The NFR Express is the most efficient means to get to the Thomas &amp; Mack Center,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events. “In addition to the routes that service our hotel partners, there is a one-way shuttle that allows fans to move from Cowboy Christmas to the arena. Because ofincreased traffic and parking congestion at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, we encourage fans to consider this complimentary mode of transportation.”</p>
      <p>In 2019, all Wrangler NFR performances begin at 6:45 p.m. PST. NFR Express will begin pick-ups at 5 p.m. and include return service until 10:30 p.m. There is no shuttle bus service during the actual rodeo performance.</p>
      <p>Rodeo fans are urged to utilize the NFR Express for round-trip transportation. In addition, fans are asked to allow approximately 15 minutes for traffic conditions from each hotel pick-up point. The NFR Express routes and pick-up points are as follows:</p>
