      <p>SHELBOURNE HAVE added Georgie Poynton to their ranks ahead of next season’s return to the top flight. </p>
      <p>The SSE Airtricity League First Division champions have signed 22-year-old midfielder Poynton from Waterford, where he made 28 appearances last season. </p>
      <p>An Ireland underage international, the Dubliner has previously been on the books at Dundalk, Bohemians and, briefly, St Patrick’s Athletic. </p>
      <p>“When I heard Shels were interested as a northside lad it made it that bit more exciting and I’m looking forward to get going,” Poynton said.</p>
      <p>“Obviously it’s a big year for the club with a lot of history behind them but we’re definitely on the rise again.</p>
      <blockquote>It was a very positive in the way Ian Morris was thinking and how it is going to go this year so I just want to be apart of it.”</blockquote>
      <p>Shels boss Morris added: “He comes from a fantastic upbringing of clubs.”</p>
      <p>“He went from East Meath to Dundalk at 15, where he has been given a fantastic football education.</p>
      <p>“At only 22 he has great experience at Premier Division level. He will bring energy and quality to our squad.”</p>
