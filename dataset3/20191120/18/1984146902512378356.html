      <h2>Friends and relatives tell of popular pub-goer's tough childhood after Bigg Market tragedy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Doughty</a></address>
      <p>New details of popular Mark Connelly's mysterious life have have emerged following his sudden death on the Bigg Market.</p>
      <p>The Chronicle reported last week how <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mark-connelly-bigg-market-death-17244599">Mark, who was a familiar face around Newcastle city centre, was pronounced dead</a> after he collapsed on the Bigg Market, last Monday.</p>
      <p>But despite having legions of friends in the pubs where he drank, the 50-year-old's many pals knew little about his home life.</p>
      <p>Since the tragedy staff and customers at the Duke of Northumberland, where Mark was a regular, have been donating money to a collection set-up for his family.</p>
      <p>But today a distant relative, who had not seen Mark for almost 20 years, has told how he had lost contact with most of his relations.</p>
      <p>And as the woman, who the Chronicle has agreed not to name, revealed details of Mark's difficult childhood she told of her relief at finding out how popular he was.</p>
      <p>She said:"I am so pleased he had so many friends who loved him for who he is. He was a lovely kid, so loving. I'm so pleased he had friends who cared for him."</p>
      <p>Mark, who was also known as John and Joseph, was very popular among staff and regulars at the Rose and Crown, The Duke of Northumberland, The Beehive and other city bars.</p>

      <p>Following his death <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mark-connelly-bigg-market-death-17244599">friends described him </a>as a 'larger than life character' who was 'always smiling'.</p>
      <p>However, his relative has revealed how Mark's childhood was taunted by tragedy.</p>
      <p>She said he was brought-up by his grandmother following the death of both his parents, and lost contact with much of his family.</p>
      <p>Allison Elliott knew Mark when he was a child and attended school with her brother.</p>
      <p>She said he had suffered from learning difficulties.</p>
      <p>"I have known him since he was a child, he went to school with my brother," the 53-year-old, who knew Mark as Joseph, explained.</p>
      <p>"He lost his parents when he was young and has a brother, as I know that’s the only relative.</p>
      <p>"Joseph lived in Winlaton for a while and was a popular young lad once working in Bleach Green Labour Club as a glass collector. He was really friendly and helpful.</p>
      <p>"He was always a quiet kid, but I think as he got older he must have got more confident. His parents died when he was young.</p>
      <p>"He was always smiling, even though he had such a tragic life."</p>
      <p>It is understood Mark, whose real name was John, had been out for a drink with a friend when he collapsed while walking from the Beehive to the Rose and Crown, at around 5.30pm last Monday.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses said passing police officers attempted to revive him, but nothing could be done to save his life and he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Following his death, pub staff and customers paid tribute to Mark, who is thought to be from the Felling area of Gateshead</p>
      <p>Mary McDaid, 45, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fenham">Fenham</a>, who works behind the bar at The Duke of Northumberland, also known as The Clock, said: “He was in here nearly every day. Everybody knew him.</p>
      <p>And Rose and Crown customer Bill Irwing, 75, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/benwell">Benwell </a>said: “He was one of the city’s biggest characters without a doubt. He was very well liked.</p>
      <p>“He was always happy. He will be a big miss.”</p>
      <p>Joseph Chappell, manager at The Clock has been trying to find out more about Mark's background.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old said: "Everyone has been gutted. We have had people crying in here.</p>
      <p>"We have had lots of customers donating money, there’s a few hundred pounds. I’m going to have to ring the police to find out if there is any family we can donate it to.</p>
      <p>“But I think his friends were his family.”</p>
      <p>Joseph said there had been a sombre atmosphere in his pub since Mark’s death.</p>
      <p>He added: “Everyone has been gutted. We have had people crying in here.”</p>
