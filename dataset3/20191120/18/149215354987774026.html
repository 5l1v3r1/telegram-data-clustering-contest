      <p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-andrew-denies-claims-of-epstein-accuser-virginia-roberts-giuffre-in-rare-interview/">has alleged</a> she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, which he denied in a recent BBC interview, saying, "I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened." But the Duke of York came under fire for many of his answers about his friendship with Epstein in this interview, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/world/europe/prince-andrew-epstein.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">including when he said</a>, "Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes."</p>
      <p>"Unbecoming?" journalist Emily Maitlis shot back. "He was a sex offender." At another point in the interview, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50451953">he said</a> his relationship with Epstein had some "seriously beneficial outcomes" and tried to refute Giuffre's claims against him <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/claudiakoerner/prince-andrew-epstein-bbc-interview">by saying that</a>, although she recalls seeing him sweating, "I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I didn't sweat at the time."</p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein," the Wednesday statement reads. Prince Andrew had <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein">reportedly been considering</a> a follow-up interview.</p>
