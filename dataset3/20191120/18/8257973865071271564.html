      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Coldplay released a new music video Wednesday for their song "Daddy" that uses 2D animation and puppets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWhiCkEY-Yk&amp;feature=emb_logo">The clip</a> features a young child alone at sea who travels using a small boat. The child falls into the water and rides a flying whale before the boat reaches a sandy beach.</p>
      <p>Another character, presumably the child's father, then lends a helping hand.</p>
      <p>"Daddy are you out there?/ Daddy won't you come and play?/ Daddy do you not care?/ Is there nothing that you want to say?" Coldplay frontman <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chris_Martin/?tps=1">Chris Martin</a> sings on the track.</p>
      <p>The music video was directed by Asa Lucander and produced by Aardman Animations with Brunskill &amp; Grimes handling the puppetry.</p>
      <p>Coldplay also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE9cCb-s_UY">lyric video</a> for a new song titled "Champion of the World."</p>
      <p>"I tried my best to be just like/ The other boys in school/ I tried my best to get it right/ And died at every duel/ This mountainside is suicide/ This dream will never work/ Still the sign upon my headstone, write/ A champion of the world," Martin sings.</p>
