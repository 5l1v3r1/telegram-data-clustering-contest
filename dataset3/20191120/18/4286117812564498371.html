      <h1>Maharashtra government formation: Hiccup over secularism as NCP-Congress hold marathon meeting</h1>
      <h2>Sources confirmed to India Today TV that 'secularism' continued to remain the prickly issue between the Shiv Sena and the Congress, the latter being persistent on including it in the common minimum programme.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:33:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Mausami Singh</a></address>
      <p>Late-night meetings continued at 6 Janpath, the plush Lutyen's Delhi bungalow of Sharad Pawar, as Congress troubleshooter Ahmed Patel and NCP supremo remained locked in close-door meetings with other leaders to iron out the hurdles as they inch towards forming a government with the Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Sources confirmed to India Today TV that 'secularism' continued to remain the prickly issue between the Shiv Sena and the Congress, the latter being persistent on including it in the common minimum programme.</p>
      <p>A top source present in the meeting confirmed that the Congress has been cautious of the hardline Hindutva image of the Sena and wants the CMP to include a clear message that the new formation will have 'secular' credentials.</p>
      <p>Leaders discussed the issue in the meeting and later Ahmed Patel went back to brief Congress president on the same.</p>
      <p>The source said that attempts were being made to reach out to the Sena on the matter and convince them that the word 'secular' is enshrined in the preamble of the constitution.</p>
      <p>It seems that the stalemate over government formation in Maharashtra is likely to end in a few days as the Congress-NCP on Wednesday announced that they would soon provide a<b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/after-key-meeting-with-ncp-congress-says-stable-government-in-maharashtra-soon-1620977-2019-11-20"> stable government in the state after finalising the terms of partnership with the Shiv Sena</a>.</b></p>
      <p>Sources said that that <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maharashtra-government-formation-congress-ncp-shiv-sena-sonia-gandhi-sharad-pawar-1620883-2019-11-20">Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi had given a go-ahead for an alliance with Shiv Sena</a></b> during her meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday.</p>
      <p>The high-level meeting was being eyed carefully as it was called to discuss the blueprint for the common minimum programme, which is a document outlining the minimum objectives of a coalition government in the state.</p>
      <p>After the conclusion of the key meeting with the NCP on Thursday, Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said there will be a stable government in the state at the earlier. He said talks with NCP will continue on Thursday</p>
      <p>"Congress-NCP has had long and positive discussions today. Discussions will continue; I am sure we will be able to give a stable government to Maharashtra very soon," he said.</p>
      <p>Addressing the media, Chavan also said another meeting will be held between senior leaders of NCP and Congress on Thursday to discuss further issues related to government formation.</p>
      <p>The NCP has been pushing for a rotational CM with a two-and-a-half-year tenure falling in its kitty while it has mooted for a deputy CM post for the Congress. Sources said ministerial berths are likely to be distributed according to a 16-15-12 formula according to the quota of MLAs that each party has.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NCPâ€™s Nawab Malik said all the three parties have to come together for government formation in Maharashtra and added that best efforts are being put in to resolve all issues.</p>
      <p>"Congress-NCP together decided that we must give an alternate govt in Maharashtra. It is not possible without NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena coming together. We are trying our best to resolve all issues. We will provide alternate govt as soon as possible," Malik said.</p>

          <b>Several key members of both parties, including Mallikarjun Kharge, KC Venugopal, Ahmed Patel, Jairam Ramesh, Prithviraj Chavan, Naseem Khan, Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar, Supriya Sule and Sunil Tatkare were a part of the meeting.</b>

      <p>Reacting to the development, senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the government in Maharashtra will be formed in the next four to five days. He said Congress and NCP leaders have met today and agreed that common ground has to be reached for a coalition government.</p>
      <p>"They (Congress-NCP) are right. If a three-party government is to be formed then it will take time. The common minimum programme will be discussed," Raut said. <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maharashtra-government-formation-shiv-sena-sanjay-raut-congress-ncp-1620990-2019-11-20">He also said that the work towards forming a stable government in Maharashtra started today and it will be done in the next four to five days</a>.</b></p>

      <p>Raut further added that the public wants the chief minister to be from Shiv Sena and that Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray should lead.</p>
      <p>In the October 21 Maharashtra polls, the BJP-Sena alliance had secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively in the 288-member Assembly. The Congress and the NCP, the pre-poll allies, had won 44 and 54 seats respectively.</p>
