      <h1>$400,000,000 in XRP Linked to Illegal Activity, Crypto Firm Says Bitcoin (BTC) Used on the Dark Web More Often</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:47:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>A data analytics firm says a scan of the XRP Ledger shows $400 million in XRP transactions involve illegal activity.</p>
      <p>Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elliptic-launches-the-worlds-first-xrp-transaction-monitoring-system---identifies-400m-of-illicit-activity-in-xrp-transactions-300961520.html">says</a> the illicit transfers make up fewer than 0.2% of all XRP transactions, showing that the vast majority of activity involving the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is legitimate.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We began researching XRP more than a year ago and have already identified several hundred XRP accounts linked to illicit activity ranging from thefts to scams and the sale of stolen credit cards.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>As criminal use of crypto-assets such as XRP evolves, we are committed to shining a light on this illicit activity, giving financial institutions the confidence they need to engage with the crypto ecosystem.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The company says it has assessed risk on transactions worth several trillion dollars across the crypto ecosystem in a push to identify activities involving money laundering, terrorist fundraising, fraud, and other financial crimes.</p>
      <p>Its <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/our-thinking/bitcoin-money-laundering">analysis</a> of Bitcoin finds that 0.5% of BTC transactions are tied to the dark web.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“As of 2019, only $829 million in bitcoin has been spent on the dark web1 (a mere 0.5% of all bitcoin transactions.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Since blockchain technology provides a public record of each transaction, exposure to the risk of financial crime in cryptocurrency including bitcoin money laundering is manageable.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>In comparison to the risks presented by cryptocurrencies that fuel illicit activities, a <a href="https://www.unodc.org/wdr2017/field/Booklet_5_NEXUS.pdf">report</a> published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime tracks over a trillion dollars that are funneled through the traditional monetary system every year.</p>
      <p>A separate report by <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/02/05/banks-not-bitcoin-carry-the-torch-for-the-2-trillion-money-laundering-industry/">Bloomberg</a> also highlights the multi-trillion-dollar money laundering industry involving banks and national currencies.</p>
      <p>Elliptic is backed by SBI Group, Octopus Ventures and Santander Innoventures, among others.</p>
      <p>The company recently added XRP to its analytics platform, which is designed to help clients identify and avoid risk in the blockchain and crypto industries.</p>
      <p>Its support for XRP is currently in beta, with a full roll out planned for next month.</p>
