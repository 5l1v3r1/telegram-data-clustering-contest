        <b>The Supercopa de Espana will see goal-line technology and the new “Vardict” system used for the first time in Spanish football.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The RFEF’s Technical Committee of Referees is making changes for the Supercopa de Espana, introducing goal-line technology for the first time while improving communication for VAR decisions.</p>
      <p>A revamped Supercopa will take place in Saudi Arabia in January, with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Valencia involved.</p>
      <p>For the first time in Spanish football, goal-line technology will be implemented in order to aid officials, with previous such calls made with the help of the VAR.</p>
      <p>Referees chief Carlos Velasco Carballo explained on Wednesday: “The system consists of 14 cameras on the pitch. A high resolution camera will be on the goal line.</p>
      <p>“This system is connected to the referees and, in less than a second, you hear the word ‘goal’ three times and the watch will vibrates to indicate the goal.</p>
      <p>“It’s historic in Spanish football.”</p>

      <p>The use of VAR in the first part of the LaLiga season was also discussed, with Velasco Carballo revealing the system had corrected 19 of 23 officiating errors.</p>
      <p>Criticism of VAR has often come from the way calls are communicated to supporters within the stadium, but Velasco Carballo has outlined plans to improve this problem for the Supercopa.</p>
      <p>A “Vardict” system on screens aims to ensure fans are kept up to date.</p>
      <p>He said: “It will serve to communicate the decisions to the spectators in the stadium, a fundamental aspect in the success of the VAR. They will have the same information as the spectators watching on television.”</p>
