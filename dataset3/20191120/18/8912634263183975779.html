      <p>LONDON: Prince Andrew on Wednesday said he was canceling his public engagements, as the outcry from the British royal’s friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed no sign of abating.<br/>Queen Elizabeth II’s second son has been under pressure since a television interview broadcast Saturday in which he defended his links to the disgraced financier, who was found dead in prison in August.<br/>An increasing number of organizations and initiatives backed by Andrew have said they were not renewing or would review their support because of the revelations.<br/>Andrew, 59, said in an emailed statement he now recognized his links to Epstein had become a “major disruption” to the royal family and the charities and organizations associated with it.<br/>“Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty (the Queen) if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission,” he added.<br/>“I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.<br/>“His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.<br/>“I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”</p>
