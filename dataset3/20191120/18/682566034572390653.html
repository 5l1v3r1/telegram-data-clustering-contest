      <p>Cape Town - Proteas batsman <b>David Miller</b> has been snapped up by the <b>Hobart Hurricanes</b> for next month's Big Bash League in Australia.</p>
      <p>Miller is the latest South African to land a Big Bash deal following AB de Villiers (Brisbane Heat), Dale Steyn (Melbourne Stars) and Chris Morris (Sydney Thunder).</p>
      <p>According to the <b><i>Hurricanes</i></b> <a href="https://www.hobarthurricanes.com.au/news/miller-signs/2019-11-20">official website</a>, Miller, who has played 126 One-Day Internationals and 72 T20s for the Proteas to date, will be available for <b>all</b> 14 home and away T20 games before returning to South Africa.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old will be making his Big Bash debut as the tournament gets underway from December 17 - February 8.</p>
      <p>"It's very exciting to welcome a player of David's calibre to the Hurricanes," said Cricket Tasmania CEO Nick Cummins.</p>
      <p>"We expect to lose some batting experience throughout the season, so David will provide valuable runs in our drive to our third successive finals campaign."</p>
      <p>The Hobart Hurricanes campaign gets underway December 20 against the Sydney Sixers at Traeger Park.</p>
