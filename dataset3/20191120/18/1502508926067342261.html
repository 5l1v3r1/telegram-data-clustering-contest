      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/microsoft">Microsoft </a>is planning to integrate some of Google's services into its Outlook.com webmail client.</p>
      <p>The company has started testing integrating Gmail, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>Drive, and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>Calendar on some Outlook accounts. Once linked, Google's services will be automatically displayed inside Outlook.com on the web, The Verge notes.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Florian B who got early access explained that the feature does not allow adding more than one <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>account and as it is an early test, switching between Outlook and Gmail accounts refreshes the entire page.</p>
