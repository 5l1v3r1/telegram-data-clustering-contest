      <h3>Jonas Brothers Score First Grammy Nomination In Ten Years</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/jonas-brothers/">The Jonas Brothers</a> have scored their first Grammy nomination in ten years, earning a nod for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for their comeback single, “Sucker.” The members of the group took to Twitter to reveal their surprise and delight at the honor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/nick-jonas/">Nick Jonas</a> tweeted, “We’re Grammy-nominated!!!!!” and brother <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/joe-jonas/">Joe</a> celebrated the news with the word “Ah!’ and an emoji.</p>
      <p>Kevin Jonas added a video of the family and their friends finding out that they were being recognized for their work, which can be seen below.</p>
      <p>The musical group is up against some tough competition in their category.</p>
      <p>The Jonas Brothers will square off against Ariana Grande &amp; Social House’s “Boyfriend,” Lil Nas X feat. Billy Ray Cyrus’ “Old Town Road,” Post Malone &amp; Swae Lee’s “Sunflower” and Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello, for “Señorita.”</p>
      <p>The last time The Jonas Brothers were nominated for a Grammy Award, they lost to Adele in the category of Best New Artist. Others nominated in that category at that time were Duffy, Lady Antebellum and Jazmine Sullivan.</p>
      <p>The year 2019 has been a watershed year for the family band, who reunited after a six-year hiatus to create new music which was included in an album titled <i>Happiness Begins,</i> as well as a subsequent world tour that has lasted throughout the better part of 2019.</p>

      <p>The Jonas Brothers have evolved from a Disney-backed teen pop band who starred in their own Disney Channel show <i>Jonas</i> and films like <i>Camp Rock</i> and <i>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</i> into a more mature, thoughtful group of men who now create music that reflects their move into adulthood.</p>

      <p>All of the brothers are now married: Joe to actress Sophie Turner, Nick to actress Priyanka Chopra and Kevin to Danielle Jonas, with whom he shares two daughters Alena and Valentina.</p>

      <p>These loving relationships are reflected in the band’s current music and tour, which is a family affair where fans can usually see the three women in attendance at their shows. The Jonas wives were also featured in the video for “Sucker” as well.</p>
