      <p>A baby girl was left with a stare ‘like nothing was there’ after being bludgeoned so badly by her dad she later died, police say.</p>
      <p>The seven month-old infant, who has not been named, ‘went limp’ after the alleged attack by her dad Alexander Romero in Kimball, Nebraska in March this year.</p>
      <p>Landscaper Romero, 24, will stand trial for the intentional child abuse death of the girl in March, it was announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>The little girl was found to have suffered bruising on both her temples near the midline of her skull.</p>
      <p>Doctors also discovered wounds to her liver and spleen, with the girl declared brain dead and taken off life support on April 3.</p>
      <p>Romero offered police two different stories after being taken in for questioning.</p>
      <p>He initially claimed to have placed his daughter on the couch after she woke up from a nap, only for her to fall off and injure herself.</p>

      <p>Officer Mike Winget put this claim to a doctor who treated the little girl, only to be told it was ‘absolutely not’ credible.</p>
      <p>He said the injuries bore the hallmarks of being intentionally rather than accidentally inflicted.</p>
      <p>Romero is then said to have approached police again with what he claimed was the true story, the <a href="https://www.westernnebraskaobserver.net/story/2019/04/18/news/suspect-faces-child-abuse-death-charge/5593.html">Western Nebraska Observer</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The dad claimed to have been running around the house with the baby in his arms when he tripped in his bedroom.</p>
      <p>He claimed to have fallen to the bed, then onto the floor while holding the little girl, inflicting the terrible injuries that ultimately killed her.</p>
      <p>The girl’s mother was interviewed, with the unnamed woman telling police that Romero had ‘a short tempter.’</p>
      <p>Police and prosecutors have yet to say whether they believe Romero’s version of events.</p>
      <p>He faces up to life in prison if convicted, and is being held in lieu of $100,000 bond.</p>
