      <p>HANOI, Vietnam — U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper is ending an Asia tour with the same troubles he found on arrival last week on the Korean peninsula.</p>
      <p>Together they pose risks to U.S. national security and to the future of Washington’s alliance with Seoul.</p>
      <p>The toughest of these problems is North Korea’s refusal to restart negotiations with Washington on eliminating its nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>Esper had hoped that his decision to postpone a military flying exercise with South Korea would help nudge the North back to the negotiating table.</p>
      <p>The North rejected the gesture.</p>
      <p>Esper told reporters Thursday in Hanoi that he was disappointed by the North’s negative response.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t regret trying to take the high road, if you will, and keep the door open for peace and diplomacy.”</p>
