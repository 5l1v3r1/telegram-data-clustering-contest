      <p>The Nandini Layout police have solved the case of murder of a 31-year-old taxi driver, Santosh, and arrested a couple who allegedly killed him as he was blackmailing and harassing them.</p>
      <p>The victim’s body was discovered last Friday in a gunny bag that had been dumped near the compound of a private school at Laggere.</p>
      <p>During the course of their investigation, the police narrowed the suspects down to a couple, Manjunath and his wife, Savithri, who were running a chit fund. “Evidence gathered pointed that they had a hand in his death,” said a police officer.</p>
      <p>When questioned, Manjunath allegedly confessed that Santosh was one of the chit fund members who frequently came to their house. During one of his visits, he reportedly filmed Savithri without her knowledge and used the footage to blackmail her. He extorted close to ₹4 lakh from her, and allegedly started sexually harassing her. Unable to bear the harassment Savithri told Manjunath about the video, and the duo decided to eliminate him.</p>
      <p>“As per the plan, Savithri invited Santosh to the house on Friday night where Manjunath, who was hiding, bludgeoned him to death. The couple later stuffed his body in a gunny bag and dumped it near the school compound,” the police officer added.</p>
      <p>The police have obtained CCTV camera footage from a nearby house that shows the couple carrying the gunny bag into an auto, which they used to dump the body.</p>
      <p>The couple have been charged with murder and taken into custody for further investigation, the police said.</p>
