      <h1>Spotify is finally giving millions of free users a crucial feature that paid users have had for years, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>

          <b><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/spotify">Spotify</a> is the world’s most popular music streaming service, with over 100 million paying subscribers and over 217 million monthly users.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Spotify’s paying users get access to certain functionality that free users do not. One such feature was the ability to stream Spotify music on Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo devices, Sonos speakers, and Bose speakers.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>That changed on Wednesday, as Spotify announced support for free users across a variety of devices.</b>

      <p>Spotify has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spotify-stock-price-beats-expectations-earnings-2019-4-1028148436">over 100 million people paying monthly</a> for its music streaming service. The reason is simple: Ads.</p>
      <p>Paying a monthly subscription fee to Spotify means accessing a massive library of on-demand music without having to encounter any advertising. It also infers other benefits: Saving music for offline listening, for instance, and the ability to stream through Spotify on a variety of home speakers – including Amazon’s ubiquitous echo devices.</p>
      <p>As of Wednesday, though, Spotify is finally offering free users a feature that paid users have had for years: The ability to stream music through Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo devices, in addition to Sonos and Bose speakers.</p>

      <p>Just like Spotify’s free version for smartphones and elsewhere, the free version on the newly-supported devices is expected to run ads.</p>
      <p>In its <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-11-20/spotify-free-users-you-can-now-stream-music-on-amazon-alexa-sonos-and-bose-speakers/">announcement blog post</a>, Spotify specifically names Amazon’s Echo and Fire TV devices, Sonos’ various home speakers, and Bose’s “smart speakers and soundbars” as getting support for free Spotify users.</p>
      <p>It’s a small change that impacts a massive number of Spotify users – though the company boasts over 100 million paying subscribers, it has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spotify-stock-price-spikes-19-after-posting-surprise-quarterly-profit-2019-10-1028635918">over 248 million monthly users</a>. For now, however, it sounds like support for the devices is limited to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.</p>
