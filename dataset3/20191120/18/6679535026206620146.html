      <h1>Indirect election of Mayors raises concern</h1>

      <p>The State cabinet’s decision to revert to indirect election of Mayors, including that of Coimbatore mayor, has led to those whom <i>The Hindu</i> spoke to believe that it may not be to the city’s advantage.</p>
      <p>The cabinet on Tuesday decided that elections to the posts of Mayors, municipal chairpersons and heads of town panchayats would be indirect in that councillors or members would elect one among them to lead the local bodies.</p>
      <p>The first casualty of the cabinet’s decision is that voters in Coimbatore city will not know who the Mayoral candidate is, a retired bureaucrat and consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon say. “Unless parties declare and front a candidate, the voters will be at a loss to know who will be the city's first citizen,” the bureaucrat says.</p>
      <p>The absence of Mayoral candidate may also result in a situation where voters get to hear more of ward-level promises from contestants for councillors' posts and very little of city manifesto, unless the political parties come forward to release theirs, adds Mr. Kathirmathiyon.</p>
      <p>In case of no party getting majority in the 100-member Coimbatore Corporation Council, there will be instances of horse-trading and kidnapping of councillors, says a former Mayor on condition of anonymity. And as far as optics go, an indirectly elected Mayor will not be seen on a par with a directly elected Mayor.</p>
      <p>A councillor-turned Mayor will be at the mercy of those who elected him, says DMK urban district in-charge and Singanallur MLA N. Karthik. This will lead to a situation where he favours the wards of his supporters or his ward and may not always have the city's best interest in mind.</p>
      <p>But this is not always true as even directly elected Mayors are known to favour only those wards that voted for him or her, just as ruling parties are often accused of neglecting areas where opposition members are elected.</p>
      <p>Direct or indirect election it does not make much of a difference as the post and the Corporation Council have clearly defined powers, says former CPI councillor K. Purushothaman. A directly elected from one party and a council with majority from rival party may lead to a stalemate and city's development taking a hit.</p>
      <p>An indirect election to Mayor at least eliminates this possibility, he argues and says ultimately the council majority will prove powerful.</p>
      <p>But when it comes to removing a Mayor, the law does not make a distinction between directly or indirectly elected persons. Three-fifths of councillors will have to propose a no-confidence motion and four-fifths of councillors will have to vote to have the motion approved.</p>
