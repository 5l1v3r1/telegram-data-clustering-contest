      <p>Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) officials have suspended vehicle safaris in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve after a dispute between the Forest Department and the drivers, and also owing to a feud among the drivers.</p>
      <p>The vehicle safaris in the buffer zone are a part of the Eco-Development Committee’s activity, comprising 160 drivers. The EDC was formed to regularise the safaris, particularly around Moyar, Singara and Masinagudi, in view of illegal safaris in those parts of the tiger reserve that were off-limits for tourists.</p>
      <p>However, the EDC has been closed down for the last week, due to a dispute between the drivers and the Forest Department over the restrictions on the entry of vehicles into the MTR through the Kalhatty Ghat Road.</p>
      <p>As for the feud among the drivers, Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), L.C.S. Srikanth said “There were two drivers’ unions which had been part of the EDC. However, another union had recently sprung up, and the vehicle operators were themselves feuding and trying to stop each other from operating. So, the Forest Department decided to step in and suspend vehicle safaris in the buffer zone for the time being”.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the drivers held a meeting with the Forest Department, the district police and local politicians. They had also called for the tiger reserve’s management to ease restrictions on entry of vehicles into MTR via Kalhatty Ghat Road.</p>
      <p>Field Director of MTR K.K. Kaushal said that following the discussions with the drivers, it was expected that the vehicle safaris in the buffer zone would resume next week.</p>
      <p>The EDC in Theppakadu in the core area of the reserve was not affected by the dispute.</p>
