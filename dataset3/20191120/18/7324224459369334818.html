      <p>“Doughnut-shaped” rings of cancer DNA make tumours more aggressive and resistant to treatment, scientists believe.</p>
      <p>Circles of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) are found abundantly in human tumour cells, according to researchers from the United States.</p>
      <p>The shape is different to normal human DNA, which forms twisting double helixes of genetic material, similar in appearance to ladders.</p>
      <p>These are packed into cell nuclei by being tightly wrapped around clusters of protein complexes.</p>
      <p>To read the genetic instructions, cells rely on enzymes to cut and move sections, making only part of the DNA accessible at any one time.</p>
      <aside>This unique shape in human cancer cells is quite unlike normal human DNA<cite>Professor Paul S Mischel, co-senior author</cite></aside>
      <p>The researchers likened the process to “reading a partially opened scroll”.</p>
      <p>But cancer cells share some similarities with bacteria, which contain circular DNA that is generally more accessible.</p>
      <p>This “highly accessible” shape provides more access points where genetic information can be quickly transcribed and expressed, allowing cells to generate large amounts of growth-promoting genes, the scientists said.</p>
      <p>It also allows them to evolve more quickly and respond more forcefully to their changing environment and threats, such as chemotherapy and radiation, they added.</p>
      <p>The research comes from the University of California San Diego, the UC San Diego branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Stanford University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>
      <p>Paul S Mischel, professor at the UC San Diego School of Medicine Department of Pathology and co-senior author, said the discovery marks a “paradigm-shift”.</p>
      <aside>It really shines a new light on to the 3D organisation of the screwed-up cancer genome and epigenome, which now provides a mechanistic basis for understanding why certain tumour cells are so aggressive<cite>Professor Paul S Mischel</cite></aside>
      <p>He said: “This unique shape in human cancer cells is quite unlike normal human DNA.</p>
      <p>“It really shines a new light on to the 3D organisation of the screwed-up cancer genome and epigenome, which now provides a mechanistic basis for understanding why certain tumour cells are so aggressive.”</p>
      <p>The authors say ecDNA was previously thought to be rare but is now believed to be detected in nearly half of human cancers.</p>
      <p>When the cells propagate they parcel out ecDNA in a seemingly random way, which allows for more rapid evolution and genetic change than if they simply divided into genetically identical cells, the scientists said.</p>
      <p>The findings are published in the journal Nature.</p>
