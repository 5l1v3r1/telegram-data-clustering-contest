      <p>Being honest won't likely be enough to get an Osoyoos man off the hook for some dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>A 52-year-old man driving a Ford F-250 pickup truck on Highway 97 at Island Road north of Oliver Nov. 19 at 9:10 p.m. went off-road, striking a power pole.</p>
      <p>The collision resulted in wires snapping which left power out in the area for approximately three hours, RCMP said.</p>
      <p>When police arrived the Osoyoos man allegedly told the RCMP he was drunk. A roadside alcohol screening test confirmed this and he was issued a 90 day driving prohibition under the Motor Vehicle Act as well as had his vehicle impounded for 30 days.</p>
      <p>"The man was fortunate to not have received any serious injuries," Sgt Jason Bayda said in a press release. "It is even more fortunate he did not hurt any innocent bystanders. With all of the education out there on the risks of driving while impaired it is unfathomable we still have some people choosing to do so, putting theirs and others lives at risk."</p>
      <p>If you see an impaired driver, pull over and call 911 and report as much of the following you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>location</li>
        <li>direction of travel</li>
        <li>vehicle make, model, colour</li>
        <li>offending vehicle licence plate</li>
        <li>description of driver</li>
        <li>why you suspect impairment (vehicle weaving, driving erratic, driver openly consuming alcohol, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
