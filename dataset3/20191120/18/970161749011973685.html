        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brad-pitt/">Brad Pitt</a> has been moving on from ex-wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/angelina-jolie/">Angelina Jolie</a> as he was spotted spending time with Arrested Development’s Alia Shawkat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 55-year-old was recently spotted at am art gallery with the 30-year-old, following reports claiming the two have been going on several outings together.</p>
      <p>Snaps show the two at the same gallery, and although they were not pictured talking to each other, they were standing next to each other talking to friends.</p>
      <p>A source close to Pitt said: ‘They are absolutely just friends.’</p>
      <p>Meral Melika Duran posted the pictures of Brad and Alia talking to the artist behind the works, Martin Wethmann, and boy are we glad she did.</p>
      <p>‘Supporting arts &amp; artist as usual. Thank you Brad Pitt for joining us,’ she captioned the post. ‘Had the pleasure to introduce my great artist friend Martin Werthmann to Brad (please check out his work).</p>

      <p>‘Had a very interesting conversation with Brad. Like [his] positive attitude.’</p>

      <p>Brad looked relaxed as he sported his signature flat cap and shirt with one button undone.</p>
      <p>If he was trying to go for the inconspicuous look, he might want to find a new cap.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Alia went for a boho chic look and chatted to other people.</p>
      <p>One photo appears to be them talking to each other (probably about their next dinner outing).</p>
      <p>According to now-deleted pictures, the two celebs were spotted grabbing dinner together before the exhibition and also attended a comedy show together the month before.</p>
      <p>Brad was previously married to Maleficent star Angelina Jolie but the couple split in September 2016.</p>
      <p>Since then, the Once Upon A Time In Hollywood actor has been seen with multiple women. It is Brad Pitt after all.</p>

      <p>Angelina – who he shares six children with – is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/angelina-jolie-dates-moves-messy-brad-pitt-divorce-11147413/">also apparently dating again, according to reports</a>.</p>
      <p>She is back on the market and open to love and who can find anything wrong with that?</p>
      <p>As she continues to blaze a Hollywood trail, following the sequel to Maleficent, Mistress Of Evil, and filming the upcoming Marvel’s Eternals, sources have claimed Ange is taking some time to get back out there in the dating world. Snaps for Angelina!</p>

      <p>‘She isn’t closed to the idea of meeting someone new, but it’s not her main priority,’ a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/angelina-jolie-has-been-on-a-few-dates-since-brad-pitt-divorce/">source told Us Weekly</a>.</p>
      <p>‘She’s all about focusing on the kids, her job, and cleaning up her messy divorce.’</p>
      <p>Once all that’s taken care of, the source added: ‘She’ll get back to the dating scene, without a doubt.’</p>
