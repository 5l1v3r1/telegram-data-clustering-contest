      <h1>Coldplay Deliver Two New Singles, "Daddy" &amp; "Champion of the World"</h1>
      <h2>One of them comes with an animated visual.</h2>

      <p>With their eighth studio album just days away, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/coldplay">Coldplay</a> are introducing two more new songs off <i>Everyday Life</i>. First up “Champion of the World,” which features additional contributions from Frightened Rabbit’s Scott Hutchison and a co-writing credit for the songwriters behind Owl John’s “Los Angeles Be Kind.” The other half of today’s releases is “Daddy,” and that effort comes to us alongside its accompanying visual — an animated piece put together by Asa Lucander and Aardman Animations.</p>
      <p>“I knew when I had the opportunity to pitch on this project that is was going to be a very special one,” “Daddy” director Asa Lucander shares via an official statement. “A few minutes into listening to the track ‘Daddy’ – It spoke to me in a way that stories and visual images began to dance in front of me. And when this happens you know that you are on to something very special indeed. I tend to get drawn to emotional stories and this was certainly one I wanted to tell.”</p>
      <p>“Scott had a song called ‘Los Angeles Be Kind,’ which I love,” Coldplay’s Chris Martin explains in an additional set of remarks. “When I first heard it, I thought it was going to go one way; but it went another. Anyway ‘Champion Of The World’ is the song that came from following the other path, and that’s why Scott is a co-writer on this song. Today is also his birthday. So happy birthday Scott and thank you for your beautiful music, wherever you are.”</p>
