      <p>Prince Andrew said in a statement Wednesday that he would step back from public duties "for the foreseeable future" following a firestorm of criticism over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Here's the full statement from the Duke of York:</p>
      <p>"It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organizations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>
