      <h1>Demand grows for Siddharth Shukla’s eviction from Bigg Boss after he indulges in more violence against Asim Riaz</h1>

      <p>Demand is growing for Siddharth Shukla’s eviction from the <i>Bigg Boss </i>reality show after he indulged in more violence against Asim Riaz on Wednesday night. Wednesday night’s episode also saw Siddharth Shukla and Mahira Sharma flirt with each other. Their ‘romance’ included Siddharth praising Mahira’s beauty saying that her face was priceless.</p>

      <p>Siddharth Shukla was provoked by Paras Chhabra against Asim Riaz as the former began to make fun of the latter’s modeling career in South Africa. Little did he realise that Asim was listening to his conversation with Paras. What provoked Siddharth was the statement made by Paras, which said that Asim was being disloyal to him after he continued to protect him in the competition all along.</p>
      <p>Aarti Singh rightly detected the game played by Paras, who was seen creating fissures between the two erstwhile friends. When he later told Siddharth to not lose his cool, Aarti chided him saying that why he didn’t think of the adverse reaction from Siddharth when he was provoking him against Asim.</p>
      <p>Even Devoleena Bhattacharjee and Rashami Desai wondered how Paras and Mahira Sharma had developed so much of a liking for Siddharth. Both had locked horns with Siddharth all through this season of the reality show.</p>
      <p>Shehnaaz later told Paras and Mahira that Asim had formed his own independent team with Shefali Jariwala, Himanshi Khurana and Hindustani Bhau. Aarti, she said, was acting neutral and may reveal her cards soon. Shefali, Himanshi and Asim were heard agreeing to approach Hindustani Bhau that they will support him for the captaincy role only if he makes Siddharth work in the kitchen without giving him an easy time.</p>
      <p>Aarti nailed it when she said that Siddharth was allowing himself to be used as a puppet by the likes of Paras and Mahira even though he accused ‘Paras of the same’ in the past.</p>
      <p>Hindustani Bhau also agreed with Aarti stating that Paras and Shehnaaz desperately wanted either Asim or Siddharth to physically assault each other.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, several prominent individuals from the entertainment industry have slammed <i>Bigg Boss </i>for ignoring Siddharth’s shenanigans accusing the makers of the reality show of brazen biases.</p>
