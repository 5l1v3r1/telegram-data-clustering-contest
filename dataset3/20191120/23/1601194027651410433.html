      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/randy-couture">Randy Couture</a> is one of the most respected and loved fighters in MMA history and if anyone tells you otherwise, then he or she is certainly not a fan of the sport.</p>
      <p>As reported by TMZ last month, the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> Hall of Famer suffered a major health scare when he was diagnosed with a heart attack after a routine work-out session.</p>
      <p>Couture has finally come out to give the fans a positive update on his health. The former UFC Heavyweight Champion told TMZ Sports that he feels amazing now and that he has a second follow-up this Friday. He also outlined what he needs to do to avoid further complications with his health.</p>
      <blockquote>“Everything’s great, man. I feel amazing. I should have thinned this blood out a long time ago, I guess. Second follow-up on Friday. Everything’s normal, back to normal. So I gotta stay on top of the thick blood. Gotta give blood on a regular basis. Unfortunately, they have to throw my blood away because I was stationed in Germany in the 80s. That’s just the way it is.”</blockquote>
      <p>Couture experienced chest pain last month after he worked out in Los Angeles. Despite the discomfort, the UFC legend walked to a hospital and was told that he had suffered a heart attack as his blood was thicker than usual.</p>
      <p>As stated by 'The Natural' himself, he is paying closer attention to the thickness of his blood and is fit again to continue his regular schedule.</p>
      <p>The former Light Heavyweight Champion works as a colour commentator for Professional Fighters League (PFL) and the 56-year-old veteran is also expected to continue with his Hollywood career going forward.</p>
