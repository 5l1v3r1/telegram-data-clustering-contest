      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a> isn't retired but that doesn't mean he isn't happy.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> Middleweight Champion recently spoke to MMAFighting and revealed that he is content with sitting on the sidelines and focussing on other things in his life.</p>
      <p>Rockhold admitted that he doesn't intend on being a headlining act anymore and that he has lost the passion and hunger to compete inside the Octagon.</p>
      <blockquote>“My head is content where I’m at right now. I’ve done a lot of things in the sport. I’m not trying to be a headline maker. I’m not trying to say I’m going to retire and then want to come back. I don’t like to close doors on things in life. Right now, I’m just happy not fighting. It feels good to focus on other things.”</blockquote>
      <p>Despite stepping away from the cage, Rockhold has a steady flow of income from his modelling assignments. He is also working towards setting up a career as an actor.</p>
      <p>Rockhold is diverting his energy to other areas in his life and he is getting good dividends out of them. He is glad that he is away from the 'political bull****' that is prevalent in the UFC and that has added to his overall happiness.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m well off. I can choose what I want to do. I’ve got a couple companies I’m working with, and I’ve got checks flowing from so many different ways. I’m not like the rest of these guys where I have to pursue and beat the thing into the ground with fighting or jiu-jitsu or anything.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Obviously, you can’t fight forever. I can make more money outside the cage so if I can do that, why not? Not have to deal with the political bullsh*t that comes with fighting and the UFC, all that stuff we know about. I like it. It makes me happy.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rockhold will be involved in a grappling match at the Polaris 12 event against Nick Rodriguez later this month.</p>
      <blockquote>“A couple grappling matches to keep myself entertained in the process, I think the people who tune in will have some fun watching. I’m going to bring it to this kid, and if I do another one, I’m sure it’s going to be fun and entertaining.”</blockquote>
      <p>While Rockhold is satisfied giving up his MMA duties, the former Strikeforce Champion didn't close the door on a return to Octagon.</p>
      <blockquote>"I know I have a lot of fans out there. I’m sorry I’m not fighting but you never know. Maybe someday I will but I don’t foresee it at this point."

      <p>Rockhold last fought and lost to Jan Blachowicz in July this year in what was his Light Heavyweight debut and he isn't expected to be back anytime soon.</p>
