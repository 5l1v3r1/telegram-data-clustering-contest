      <h1>Hunger pains: JLaw drops price on UES condo — again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:33:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:33</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Gould Keil</a></address>
      <p>Oscar-winning, newlywed actress Jennifer Lawrence has slashed the price of her Upper East Side penthouse yet again, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/newlywed-jennifer-lawrence-selling-secret-nyc-penthouse/">just weeks after Gimme Shelter reported</a> it was on the market.</p>
      <p>The three-bedroom, 4½-bathroom home, at 400 E. 67th St., is now asking $12 million — down from an already discounted $14.25 million. That’s far less than the $15.6 million she paid for it in 2016. (The penthouse was asking an astonishing $21 million in 2014.)</p>
      <p>Lawrence also owns a unit at 443 Greenwich St., <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/24/celebrity-packed-tribeca-building-has-an-8-5m-opening/">the star-studded former bookbinding factory in Tribeca</a> that claims Meg Ryan and Justin Timberlake as residents, but she seems content to rent that one out.</p>
      <p>This Upper East Side home measures 4,073 square feet and comes with 3,000-plus square feet of outdoor space — including a summer kitchen and a built-in ping-pong table. The condo opens via a key-locked elevator and has 12-foot ceilings, an all-white chef’s kitchen, plus an open dining/living room with a two-sided limestone gas fireplace.</p>
      <p>Amenities in the building, named The Laurel, include a two-story gym, a 50-foot lap pool, a double-height lounge and private storage.</p>
      <p>The listing broker is Pamela D’Arc, of Compass.</p>
