      <p><b>MADISON, Wis.Â (AP)</b> - Sen. Ron Johnson is taking on the unusual and high-profile role of being one of President Donald Trump's most vocal supporters at the same time the Wisconsin Republican has emerged as a witness to key meetings and conversations at the heart of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Johnson could also serve as a juror who will decide the president's fate.</p>
      <p>Despite his personal involvement and concerns he raised about Trump's actions, the former plastics manufacturer has said he won't recuse himself if there's a Senate trial should the House impeach Trump.</p>
      <p>Johnson has questioned the integrity of witnesses and suggested impeachment is part of an effort to sabotage Trump.</p>
      <p>University of Missouri law school professor Frank Bowman questions Johnson's behavior but says he knows of no requirement that he recuse himself.</p>
