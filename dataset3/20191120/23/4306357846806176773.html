      <h2>Jamie Carragher has his say on Jose Mourinho's appointment as Tottenham Hotspur's new manager</h2>

      <h3>Jamie Carragher believes that Jose Mourinho could be the man to deliver a trophy at Tottenham Hotspur following his appointment as the club’s new manager.</h3>
      <p>Mourinho was officially confirmed as Spurs’ new boss on Wednesday morning after the north London club opted to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-manager">he was “reluctant”</a> to sack Pochettino, with Mourinho’s first game in charge of the Lilywhites an away clash against West Ham United this weekend.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been out of work since he was sacked by Manchester United in December of last year and he will now try to prove himself once again in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Spurs reached the Champions League final last season under Pochettino but Carragher seems to think that Mourinho could be the man to take them one step further in their quest for silverware.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/11865330/mourinho-named-tottenham-head-coach">Sky Sports</a>, Carragher said: “If Jose wants to get into top-level management, you’ve only got to look at his CV.</p>
      <p>“People question the Manchester United job, but his career as a whole has been hugely successful, and that’s one thing Tottenham have lacked at the moment.</p>
      <p>“As well as Pochettino has done, they haven’t quite got over the line to get a trophy, and that’s what Jose Mourinho does when he goes to a club.”</p>
      <p>Spurs currently find themselves down in 14th place in the Premier League table and having won just three of their opening 12 games in the top flight.</p>
      <p>They have lost six of their opening 12 games to leave them well off the pace in the race to seal Champions League qualification for next season.</p>
