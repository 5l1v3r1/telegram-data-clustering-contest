      <p>The 70-year-old, who transitioned in 2017, said: "This girl thing is pretty good!"</p>
      <p>She explained that when she appeared in the US version of the show back in 2003 as Bruce, things were different.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the Bush Telegraph, Caitlyn revealed: "As Bruce, I was doing everything for everyone, but here everyone is offering to make me tea.</p>
      <p>"This girl thing is working out pretty good." </p>
      <p>Viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to laugh at Caitlyn's quip.</p>

      <p>"‘This girl thing is working out pretty good’ I am howling at Caitlyn!", chuckled one.</p>
      <p>"'Last time I was in here, as Bruce, I was doing everything for everybody, doing this, doing that.</p>
      <p>"'Now I'm thinking to myself, this girl thing's working out good' - I like how Caitlyn can look it things in the correct, humorous manner", said another.</p>
      <p>"‘This girl thing is working out pretty good’ Caitlyn is an icon", added a third.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn is reportedly being spurred on in the jungle by heartache she’s carried for more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>The former Olympian was left distraught when her beloved younger brother Burt was killed aged 18 – in a Porsche she had lent him.</p>
      <p>Writing in her ­autobiography The Secrets Of My Life, the reality star wrote: “Burt has taken the Porsche on Old Canton Road. Because the road was old, it was narrow and curvy.</p>
      <p>"There was a rise, and Burt took it too fast. The Porsche went airborne and then crooked.</p>

      <p>“It hit a tree and then a rock wall of sizable boulders. Hutchings was flung from the car and killed instantly. Burt suffered critical injuries.”</p>
      <p>The Jenner family had to make the unimaginable decision to turn off Burt’s life-support.</p>
      <p>“I have struggled with guilt", she said, but "never in my life have I ever beat myself up about it."</p>
