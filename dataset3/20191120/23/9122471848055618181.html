      <h1>Todd McShay Updates His Draft Grade For QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:43:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a dislocated hip that will not only end his season, but keep him out of action for roughly six-to-eight months. As a result, the talented prospect could see his stock go down as the 2020 NFL Draft approaches.</p>
      <p>Prior to his injury, the thought around college football was that Tagovailoa would be the first quarterback taken off the board. Now, the top-rated quarterback on most draft boards is LSU’s Joe Burrow.</p>
      <p>ESPN analyst Todd McShay made a few changes to his latest draft rankings due to Tagovailoa’s injury.</p>
      <p>McShay revealed on Twitter that he lists Tagovailoa as the No. 13 prospect in his draft class. He originally had the Alabama gunslinger as the second-best prospect heading into last weekend.</p>

      <p>Another interesting move from McShay was his decision to bump Burrow up to the No. 2 spot in his rankings.</p>
      <p>Even though it seems like an overreaction from McShay, he did state that his stance on Tagovailoa will change if the medical results are all positive moving forward.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa could ultimately return to Alabama if he wants, but McShay and other draft analysts believe he should leave after this season.</p>
      <p>Where would you rank Tagovailoa among all the draft-eligible quarterbacks this year?</p>
