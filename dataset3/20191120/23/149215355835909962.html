      <p>Impeachment testimony <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879521/kurt-volker-reverses-past-testimony-admits-sondland-brought-biden-investigations-meeting-ukraine">changes</a> are turning out to be game changers.</p>
      <p>In the second of Wednesday's back-to-back impeachment hearings, Defense Department official Laura Cooper had something to revise from her closed-door testimony right off the bat. While Cooper <a href="https://twitter.com/addysue/status/1197290694718763009">originally testified</a> Ukrainian officials started asking about withheld security aid on Sept. 5, she said Wednesday she's since heard from aides that Ukrainians had inquired months earlier.</p>
      <p>The withholding of aid to Ukraine is a major part of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It's one half of the quid pro quo Trump has denied, allegedly withheld by the Trump administration until the Ukrainian government agreed to announce an investigation into the Bidens. Several officials have testified the aid was held up for this reason, but one <a href="https://twitter.com/MarshallCohen/status/1197292110736703488">major point made by Republicans</a> has been that the aid was eventually released, and that the Ukrainians <a href="https://twitter.com/ktbenner/status/1197292469223936000">didn't even know</a> it was missing until after Trump's infamous July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he requested the Biden investigation.</p>
      <p>Cooper's testimony undercuts that narrative. She said Wednesday she'd since seen emails provided by staffers showing Ukrainian officials asked about the aid on July 25, the day of the call where Trump asked Zelensky to "do me a favor." If that's true, it would be much harder to claim the Ukrainians didn't feel pressured by Trump's request.</p>
