      <p>He said that Greece for the sixth year has overreached primary surplus targets and is expected to meet targets in 2020.</p>
      <p>He said Greece has taken important steps in dealing with non-performing loans which will allow banks to extend credit to businesses and individuals.</p>
      <p>Moscovici said the positive report will determine the disbursement of more funds to Greece, the return of profits on Greek bonds from EU central bank.</p>
      <p>He said the business environment shows that the government is meeting its 2019 targets.</p>
