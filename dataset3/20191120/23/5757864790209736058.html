      <p>The holiday season means gifts, lavish meals, stocking stuffers, and what appear to be literally hundreds of holiday-themed movies running in perpetuity on the Hallmark Channel, which has come to replace footage of a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72899/luminous-story-behind-tvs-yule-log">crackling fireplace</a> as the background noise of choice for cozy evenings indoors. Last year, roughly 70 million people <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1086486/how-hallmark-channel-christmas-movies-unexpectedly-became-a-coveted-rite-of-passage">watched</a> Hallmark's holiday scheduling block. If you’re curious how the <a href="https://www.hallmarkchannel.com/christmas">network</a> manages to assemble films like <i>Check Inn to Christmas</i>, <i>Christmas at Graceland: Home for the Holidays</i>, and <i>Sense, Sensibility &amp; Snowmen</i> with such efficiency—a total of 40 new films will <a href="https://people.com/tv/hallmark-holiday-movie-lineup-2019/">debut</a> this season on the Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies and Mysteries, and Hallmark Movies Now—keep reading.</p>
      <h3>1. The Hallmark Channel Christmas movie tradition started with ABC.</h3>
      <p>The idea of unspooling a continuous run of holiday films <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hallmark-channel-christmas-movies-with-lacy-chabert-candace-cameron-bure-2017-10">started</a> in the 1990s, when ABC offshoot network ABC Family started a "25 Days of Christmas" programming promotion that would go on to feature the likes of Joey Lawrence and Mario Lopez. The Hallmark Channel, which launched in 2001, didn’t fully embrace the concept until 2011, when ABC Family moved away from the concept in an effort to appeal to teen viewers.</p>
      <h3>2. Most Hallmark Channel Christmas movies are shot in Canada.</h3>

      <p>To <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hallmark-channel-christmas-movies-with-lacy-chabert-candace-cameron-bure-2017-10">maximize</a> their $2 million budget, most Hallmark Channel holiday features are shot in Canada, where tax breaks can stretch the dollar. Wintry Vancouver is a popular destination, though films have also been shot in Montreal and Toronto. One film, 2018's <i>Christmas at the Palace</i>, was <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a25049086/hallmark-christmas-at-the-palace-filming-location/">shot</a> in Romania to take advantage of the country's castles.</p>
      <h3>3. Each Hallmark Channel Christmas movie only takes a couple of weeks to film.</h3>
      <p>If you’re wondering why a holiday movie on basic cable can regularly attract—and keep—a list of talent ranging from Candace Cameron Bure to Lacey Chabert, the answer is partly scheduling. Most Hallmark holiday movies take just two to three weeks to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1086486/how-hallmark-channel-christmas-movies-unexpectedly-became-a-coveted-rite-of-passage">shoot</a>, meaning actors don’t have to commit months out of the year to a project. Actors like <a href="https://www.hallmarkmoviesandmysteries.com/a-blue-ridge-mountain-christmas/cast/rachael-leigh-cook">Rachael Leigh Cook</a>, who stars in this year's <i>A Blue Ridge Mountain Christmas</i>, have also complimented the channel on giving them opportunities to be with their families while on location: Cook said that the production schedule allowed her time to <a href="https://www.etonline.com/rachael-leigh-cook-on-valuing-the-hallmark-family-if-a-fourth-vineyard-film-is-in-the-works-118530">FaceTime</a> with family back home.</p>
      <h3>4. Hallmark Channel Christmas movies use a variety of tricks to create snow.</h3>

      <p>Even more pervasive than <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/christmas/251003/dean-cain-s-christmas-movies-an-almost-definitive-guide">Dean Cain</a> in the Hallmark Channel Christmas line-up is snow. Because some of the films shoot in the summer, it’s not always possible to achieve that powder naturally. Producers use a variety of tricks to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hallmark-channel-christmas-movies-with-lacy-chabert-candace-cameron-bure-2017-10">simulate</a> snowfall, including snow blankets that mimic the real thing when laid out; foam; commercial replica snow; crushed limestone; and ice shavings. Actors might also get covered with soapy bubbles for close-ups. The typical budget for snow per movie is around $50,000.</p>
      <h3>5. There’s a psychological reason why Hallmark Channel Christmas movies are so addictive.</h3>
      <p>Like a drug, Hallmark Channel Christmas movies provide a neurological reward. Speaking with CNBC in 2019, Pamela Rutledge, behavioral scientist, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, and a faculty member in the Media Psychology department at Fielding Graduate University, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/here-s-why-it-feels-so-good-watch-those-hallmark-ncna1080841">explained</a> that the formulaic plots and predictability of the films is rewarding, especially when viewers are trying to unwind from the stress of the holiday season. “The lack of reality at all levels, from plot to production, signals that the movies are meant to be escapism entertainment,” Rutledge said. “The genre is well-defined, and our expectations follow. This enables us to suspend disbelief.”</p>
      <h3>6. Hallmark Channel Christmas movie fans now have their own convention.</h3>
      <p>Call it the Comic-Con of holiday cheer. This year, fans of Hallmark Channel’s Christmas programming got to attend ChristmasCon, a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/hallmark-christmas-con-2019.html?utm_source=tw">celebration</a> of all things Hallmark in Edison, New Jersey. Throngs of people gathered to attend panels with movie actors and writers, scoop up merchandise, and vie for prizes during an ugly sweater competition. The first wave of $50 admission tickets sold out instantly. Hallmark Channel USA was the <a href="https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/2019/11/01/hallmark-channel-christmas-con-nj-looks-have-own-happy-ending/3929137002/">official</a> sponsor.</p>
      <h3>7. Hallmark Channel Christmas movies are helping keep cable afloat.</h3>

      <p>In an era of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86456/ready-cut-cord-12-cost-saving-alternatives-cable">cord-cutting</a> and streaming apps, more and more people are turning away from cable television, preferring to queue up programming when they want it. But viewers of Hallmark Channel’s holiday offerings often tune in as the movie is airing. In 2016, 4 million viewers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hallmark-channel-christmas-movies-with-lacy-chabert-candace-cameron-bure-2017-10">watched</a> the line-up “live.” One reason might be the communal nature of the films. People tend to watch holiday-oriented programming in groups, tuning in as they air. The result? For the fourth quarter of 2018, the Hallmark Channel was the most-watched cable network among women 18 to 49 and 25 to 54, even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/movies/christmas-movies-television.html">outpacing</a> broadcast network programming on Saturday nights.</p>
      <h3>8. You can get paid to watch Hallmark Channel Christmas movies.</h3>
      <p>If you think you have the constitution to make it through 24 Hallmark Channel holiday films in 12 days, you might want to consider applying for the Hallmark Movie Dream Job <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/2019/11/get-paid-1k-to-binge-watch-hallmark-christmas-movies.html">contest</a>, which is sponsored by Internet Service Partners and will pay $1000 to the winning entrant who seems most capable of binging the two dozen films and making wry comments about them on social media.
