      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/extinction-rebellion/">Extinction Rebellion</a>’s co-founder has sparked outrage after appearing to downplay the Holocaust in an interview with a German newspaper.</p>
      <p>Roger Hallam told the German newspaper Die Zeit that the murder of 6 million Jews was merely one of many genocides.</p>
      <p>In extracts from the interview released by Die Zeit on Wednesday, Hallam was quoted describing the Holocaust as ‘just another f***ery in human history.’</p>
      <p>His comments were widely condemned, including from German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who called the industrial-scale murder of Jews ‘uniquely inhuman.’</p>
      <p>Mr Maas wrote on Twitter: ‘We must always be aware of this to ensure: never again!”</p>
      <p>The co-leader of Germany’s environmentalist Green Party, Robert Habeck, told the newspaper Bild that ‘there must be no place for anti-Semitism or downplaying of the Holocaust.’</p>
      <p>Habeck urged Extinction Rebellion – known for its disruptive protests such as road blockades – to distance itself from Hallam.</p>

      <p>The group’s German branch tweeted that ‘Roger has breached the principles of XR, which don’t tolerate anti-Semitism, and isn’t welcome any longer at XR Germany.’</p>

      <p>Extinction Rebellion UK issued a statement condemning Hallam’s comments ‘unreservedly.’</p>
      <p>A statement read:  ‘Jewish people and many others are deeply wounded by the comments today.’</p>
      <p>It added that internal conversations had begun about how to address the issue, and that the group ‘stood by restorative outcomes as preferable, although in some cases exclusion is necessary.’</p>
      <p>Hallam’s publisher in Germany, Ullstein, said it was stopping delivery of the German version of his book following the remarks.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the widespread anger his comments caused, Hallam told British media that he fully acknowledged ‘the unimaginable suffering caused by the Nazi Holocaust’.</p>
      <p>However, he accused rich countries of allowing genocide to happen again ‘on a far greater scale, and in plain sight’ by failing to stop global warming, the Daily Telegraph reported.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘We are allowing our governments to willingly, and in full knowledge of science, engage in the genocide of our young people.’</p>
