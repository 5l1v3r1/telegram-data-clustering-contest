      <h1>Memphis phenom James Wiseman gets 12-game ban, NCAA charity order</h1>

      <p>The NCAA has cleared heralded freshman James Wiseman to return to the basketball court on Jan. 12.</p>
      <p>Wiseman will sit out a total of 12 games under a decision announced by the NCAA.</p>
      <p>The sports governing body also announced Wednesday that Wiseman must donate $11,500 to charity of his choice to regain his eligibility.</p>
      <p>Wiseman withdrew his lawsuit against the NCAA on Nov. 14 after Memphis played him in the Tigers’ first three games of the season. The 16th-ranked Tigers were 2-1 with the 7-foot-1 center on the court.</p>
      <p>Once Wiseman <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/memphis-james-wiseman-withdraws-lawsuit-and-will-be-forced-to-sit/">withdrew his lawsuit</a>, Memphis held him out of a win over Alcorn State while working to resolve his eligibility status with the NCAA. His first game back will be when the Tigers visit South Florida.</p>
      <p>The NCAA had ruled Wiseman was “<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/ncaa-says-possible-top-2020-pick-james-wiseman-is-ineligible-lawyer/">likely ineligible</a>” due to $11,500 coach Penny Hardaway gave the center’s family for moving expenses from Nashville to Memphis in the summer of 2017.</p>
