      <h1>Danny Kanell Has Message For ‘Delusional’ Alabama Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:15:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Danny Kanell has never shied away from blasting the SEC over the past few years. This time around he’s speaking out against Alabama as he believes Nick Saban’s team doesn’t really have a clear path to the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Alabama’s situation is a lot more complicated than usual for two reasons: Tua Tagovailoa is out for the season and the team already lost in the regular season.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide could make a statement to the selection committee by defeating the Auburn Tigers in the Iron Bowl. However, Kanell still doesn’t think that will be enough.</p>
      <p>In fact, Kanell thinks Alabama fans are “delusional” if they believe they have a better chance of making the Playoff than Oregon or Utah.</p>
      <h3>Kanell’s biggest reason for being against Alabama is the fact that Oregon and Utah have a chance at finishing with just one loss and a conference title.</h3>
      <blockquote>“The Pac-12 has been left out the past couple of years. Alabama has been given the benefit of the doubt multiple times. As a non-conference champ they got in and won the national championship. Without Tua this is the year to get away with it. You can make a strong stance by saying ‘Conference championships matter and that was the 13th game that Alabama didn’t get to play, so we’re going to give it to Oregon.’ Ultimately, I think Alabama fans that think they’re in a good spot at five are a little bit delusional because I think the Pac-12 is in a better spot.”</blockquote>
      <p>You can listen to his full argument here:</p>
      <p>Oregon and Utah need to avoid losing another game before the Pac-12 Championship if they want any chance at making the Playoff.</p>
      <p>As for Alabama, the SEC powerhouse will need a bunch of help around the country while also taking care of its own business with Mac Jones as the starting quarterback.</p>
      <p>Do you agree with Kanell’s take?</p>
