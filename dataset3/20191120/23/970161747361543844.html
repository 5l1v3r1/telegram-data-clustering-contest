      <p>A mum who sat down on piping hot curling tongs says her backside has been ‘branded for life like a farm animal<b>’.</b></p>
      <p>Kimberley Davies was curling her hair naked when she momentarily placed the 200°C tongs on her bed and stood up to reach for her hairspray.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old accidentally sat down onto the scorching curlers, causing a pain so sharp she feared she had been ‘electrocuted.’</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one tried to alleviate the burning by running her bum under cold water and applying sudocreme before heading off to work.</p>
      <p>She sat in pain for six hours before deciding to go to the hospital, where nurses declared she had second-degree burns.</p>

      <p>To make matters worse, Kimberly says the shape of the curling tongs left her with a five-ball scar that looks uncannily like ‘anal beads.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The business manager said: ‘More people have burned themselves with curling tongs than I realised, but mine is probably the most adventurous shape. It looks like anal beads.</p>
      <p>‘I wish I had used the curling wand as a sex toy because clearly I wouldn’t have burned my arse [with it].’</p>
      <p>Despite the unfortunate shape of the scar, Kimberly, from Eastbourne, managed to see the funny side.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a fabulous scar that I have’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘It does look like the solar system on my right cheek. I do have sizeable balls burned into my cheek.</p>
      <p>‘It’s my fault for a split-second putting them on the bed, grabbing my hairspray and completely forgetting that the curlers were right behind me. I won’t forget that [again].’</p>

      <p>Rather than feel embarrassed about her scar, Kimberly decided to speak out to warn others about the dangers of curling their hair naked.</p>
      <p>‘I have put a lot of stonage on that hair curler. I’m not a light girl. If you sit down with no care, it’s not like you gently sit down, I’ve just gone straight on it and it’s jolted me back off’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘I just want to say don’t curl your hair naked, because I’m now scarred for life on my arse.</p>

      <p>‘It’s second-degree burns because it’s gone through to the dermis level. I will have five balls imprinted into my arse cheek.</p>
      <p>‘I have scarred myself. I’ve branded myself like a farm animal. I’ve been branded.’</p>
      <p>Luckily for Kimberly her ‘trooper’ fiancé Ben Mellor, 36, saw the funny side and has been helping her keep the burn clean.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘He has to remember that it’s on my cheek because there will be times where he’s like, ‘come on girl’, and will tap my arse and I will shout at him. He’s been really good’.</p>

      <p>She is now having follow-up appointments to make sure the burn is healing, but says it’s starting to ‘ooze’ and is going ‘manky’.</p>
      <p>Despite her trauma she is undeterred from using her tongs against and has curled her hair since the incident.</p>
      <p>However she said she would be more careful moving forward and vowed never leave her tongs on the bed or floor again.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I think my pride is more hurt than anything. I have curled my hair since. I am completely undeterred and have since taken measures to not put them on the bed or the floor.</p>
      <p>‘I put them on a heat mat or on a storage box. I’m not taking any precautions.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t not use them again. Silly mistakes happen – and they do blinding curls.</p>

      <p>‘But I have learned a very valuable lesson. A bit of complacency has led me to scar myself.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘My new mindset is that they are hot, they are plugged in – don’t leave them around for anybody, even for a split second.</p>
      <p>‘These are hot because they are curling your hair and need to be put away safely.’</p>
