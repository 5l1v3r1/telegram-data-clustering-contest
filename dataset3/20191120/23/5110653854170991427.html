      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy WR Rankings: Chris Godwin, Mike Evans both top-five receivers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:32:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>Injuries have wreaked havoc on the wide receiver position over the past few weeks, with players starting and exiting in the first halfbecoming an increasingly common occurrence. Last week, it was JuJu Smith-Schuster, and in weeks prior, guys like Adam Thielen, DeSean Jackson, and Will Fuller have suffered that same fate. With four teams on bye (Cardinals, Chargers, Chiefs, Vikings), fantasy football owners will already be without some key pass-catchers, and these injuries don't help. Throw in a host of shaky QBs around the league, and you have a, well, shaky set of Week 12 fantasy WR rankings.</p>
      <p>Obviously, there's nothing we can do about injured/idle receivers. If they're out, they're out, and that's honestly better than having them leave early. The bigger worry for fantasy owners is the start 'em, sit 'em calls they'll have to make on talented pass-catchers in favorable matchups with bad quarterbacks. Our rankings say play most of them, but obviously they're risky.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The best examples of these receivers are Kenny Golladay (@ Redskins), Terry McLaurin (vs. Lions), Allen Robinson (vs. Giants), and, assuming he plays, Smith-Schuster (@ Bengals). These players are simply too talented to sit in these matchups. We're even willing to trust guys like Courtland Sutton (@ Bills) D.J. Moore (@ Saints), and Golden Tate (@ Bears), who are in much tougher matchups with shaky QBs.</p>
      <p>There really aren't many easy calls at receiver this week. Even guys like Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods (vs. Ravens) are question marks because the Rams suddenly run-heavy scheme. John Brown (vs. Bills) gets enough volume to produce in tough matchups, while Tyler Boyd (vs. Steelers) has disappointed but should see a lot of targets with Auden Tate (neck) likely out. Consider him a boom-or-bust WR3.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Finding legit sleepers is tough this week, as most of the prime matchups go to the aforementioned teams with questionable QB play. The Jets (vs. Raiders) are a good team to target, as both Demaryius Thomas and Robby Anderson could be available in your league. Taylor Gabriel (vs. Giants), Danny Amendola (@ Redskins), Hunter Renfrow (@ Jets), Russell Gage (vs. Buccaneers), and, depending on who else is active for the Colts, Marcus Johnson (@ Texans) also make for interesting dart throws.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Once you see that list, you'll probably decide to stick with your normal starters, regardless of their QB situation or matchup. That's fine -- we saw from DeVante Parker last week against Buffalo that wideoutscan produce despite being blanketed by a top corner -- but there's risk involved either way.</p>
