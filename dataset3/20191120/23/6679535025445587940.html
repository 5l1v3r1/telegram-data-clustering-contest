      <p>On the heels of the Coimbatore district administration serving notices on 141 brick kilns that were operating illegally without permits in five panchayats in Thadagam valley, directing them to immediately stop production, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has started serving notices on the brick kilns that did not obtain its permit.</p>
      <p>The notice served on some of the brick kilns said that they were found operating without obtaining permit from TNPCB, which is mandatory under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (Amended in 1987).</p>
      <p>Some of the brick kilns were served notice for violating Sections such as 21 and 25 of the Act. The process of serving the notice, which was originally issued by TNPCB's District Environmental Engineer (Coimbatore North) on October 22, was under way, said sources. The total number of violators was not mentioned in the notice.</p>
      <p>District Environmental Engineer (Coimbatore North), in reply to a query under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, had stated in September this year said that the TNPCB had not issued permits to any of the brick kilns.</p>
      <p>According to activists, they have mapped 187 brick kilns operating in five panchayats namely Chinna Thadagam, Nanjundapuram, Veerapandi and Somaiyampalayam. However, the show cause notice issued by the district administration said that there were only 141 brick kilns.</p>
      <p>As per the notices issued by the TNPCB, the action was taken after its officials inspected the facilities and found that they were operating without obtaining permit from board under provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.</p>
      <p>The notice has directed the violators to show cause within 15 days from its receipt, as to why penal action should not be taken against them for operating without valid consent from the Board. The notice also warns of action against the violators if they fail to reply within 15 days.</p>
      <p>Environmental activist K. Mohanraj alleged that several brick kilns in the five panchayats were functioning even after receiving the notice from the district administration. He also said there were several facilities in the five panchayats that made raw bricks and sold them to bigger units equipped with kilns. A few others were only engaged in collecting and stocking red earth, the raw material. “The authorities should inspect those facilities and check for any violations” he said.</p>
      <p>S. Ganesh of Thadagam, who had obtained information on certain violations involved in the functioning of brick kilns through the Right to Information Act, said that a petition would be submitted to the District Collector to ensure compliance by the violators to the notices issued by district administration and the TNPCB.</p>
