      <p>Latvia's broadcasting watchdog has suspended nine Russian TV channels owned by Yuri Kovalchuk, a Russian oligarch under EU sanctions for his role in Russia's aggression against Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Similarly as in Lithuania, Russian channels were previously banned in Latvia due to their content, but it's the first time a decision was made in connection to EU sanctions, <a href="https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1117604/latvia-s-broadcast-watchdog-bans-nine-russian-tv-channels">LRT </a>reports.</p>
      <p>The channels to be blocked are 'Vremya: dalekoye i blizkoye', 'Bobjor', 'Dom Kino', 'Dom Kino PREMIUM', 'Muzika Pervogo', 'O!', 'Poyekhali', 'TELECAFE' and 'Peterburg – 5 kanal', according to the Latvian public broadcaster, LSM.</p>
      <p>The ban will be in place as long as Kovalchuk is under EU sanctions, according to Ivars Āboliņš, board member of the National Electronic Mass Media Council (NEPLP) in Latvia.</p>
      <p>Kovalchuk is a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to media reports, and was named "Putin's personal banker" by Radio Free Europe, and Putin's cashier by the U.S. White House.</p>
