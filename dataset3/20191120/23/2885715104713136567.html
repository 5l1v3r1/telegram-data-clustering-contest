      <p>Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday was shown black flags allegedly by some Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers on his way to Domkal in Murshidabad district to attend an inaugural event.</p>
      <p>Dhankhar said the reception was on the expected lines considering that ruling party leaders are “making comments” against him. He accused the state government of controlling his movement by denying him a helicopter for the event. The governor, who has been engaging in a war of words with TMC leaders, was also subjected to “go back” slogans.</p>
      <p>He was in Murshidabad to inaugurate a new building at Domkal Girls’ College. When his convoy was passing through the area, a group of 50 people accompanied by some district TMC leaders waved black flags from both sides of the road. The governor rolled down the car’s windshield and waved at the protesters with a smile.</p>
      <p>“I saw that it was police officials who were protecting the protesters. When the protestors were waiving black flags, I waved my hand and they too started waving their hands,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>“When senior ministers of the state government are making comments against me, it is quite expected that lower rung leaders will stage protest against me,” Dhankhar said.</p>
      <p>He said he had sought a helicopter from the state government to travel to Murshidabad district but there was no communication from the other side in this regard. Last week, his request for a helicopter was shot down twice by the state government.</p>
      <p>Later, he wrote on Twitter, “A tumultuous welcome as I inaugurated the new building of Domkal Girls’ College. Senior leader and veteran MLA Anisur Rehman and others received me. The emotive enthusiastic reception by girl students was very touching.”</p>
      <p>The TMC distance itself from the incident.</p>
      <p>TMC leader Soumik Hossain said, “I have heard about the incident. I have no idea who showed the black flags to the governor. But I can assure that our party was not involved.”</p>
      <p>Another TMC leader, Chandrima Bhattacharya, a state minister, said, “He should ponder over what he has been doing since assuming charge as governor. What he is doing doesn’t behove the post of the governor. The people of the state are angry, so a few may have protested against him.”</p>
      <p>The TMC and the governor have crossed sword over many issues, ranging from his seating arrangement at a Durga Puja pandal to his visit to Jadavpur University to “rescue” Union minister Babul Supriyo from students.</p>
