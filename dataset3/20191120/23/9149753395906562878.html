      <h1>This MSI gaming laptop with a GTX 1650 is just $650 right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:19:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Prices for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">gaming laptops</a> just keep dropping, perhaps in preparation for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a>. No matter the reason, it's great to see laptops with modern Nvidia graphics becoming cheaper, and now you can get one MSI laptop with a GTX 1650 for just $649.00 at Walmart. For context, that's $50 less than <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100167732%20601329749&amp;Order=PRICE">the cheapest GTX 1650 laptop on Newegg right now</a>.</p>
      <p>The full specifications of this model aren't bad at all for under $700. The CPU is an Intel Core i5-9300H, with 4 cores, 8 threads, a 45W TDP, and a max turbo clock of 4.10GHz. Other hardware include 8GB of 2666MHz RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD, and a 15.6-inch 1080p "IPS-Level" screen. The display only 60Hz, but 120Hz+ screens are usually only available on laptops $1,000 or more. Windows 10 Home is preinstalled.</p>
      <p>The GTX 1650 in this laptop is an entry-level graphics card, so while it's a lot better than Intel HD integrated graphics, you might have trouble playing some large-scale AAA titles. This laptop is best suited for games like Fortnite, The Sims, Overwatch, and other optimized titles. You can get a good idea for how it performs from our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-review/">review</a>.</p>
