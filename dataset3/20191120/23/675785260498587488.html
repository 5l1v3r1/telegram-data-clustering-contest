      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Premier League Wolves announced Crypto Millions Lotto as their official online lottery partner, and the lottery's homepage boast of their link-up with Wolves</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:49:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:49</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Wolves could be forced to pull a new bitcoin lottery sponsorship deal amid growing concern about their new partner's business background.</p>
      <p>The Premier League club announced Crypto Millions Lotto as their official online lottery partner on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The organisation pledges to allow registered users to compete for a £23million jackpot prize and receive referral fees in bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Headlines on the lottery's homepage boast of their link-up with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> , who are in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>But concerns are growing at Molineux after it emerged the CEO Sulim Malook was behind a failed company called Fat Cat Gaming.</p>
      <p>It could prompt a review of Malook's operating practises as he doesn't have a UK gambling licence.</p>

      <p>Crypto Millions Lotto's parent company is Ofertas365 , based out of Curacao off the coast of Venezuela , which also launched <a href="http://www.afromillionslotto.com/">'AfroMillionsLotto'</a> in Nigeria in 2017.</p>
      <p>Its website no longer works with visitors given a chance to buy its domain name.</p>
      <p>But Malook claims he has expanded and migrated the business to Crypto Millions Lotto which also draws on the German National Lottery numbers.</p>
      <p>Yet scrutiny of Crypto Millions Lotto's terms and conditions state pay-outs for “large winnings” depend on their insurance partner Lloyds paying up and could be suspended for up to two years, pending negotiations. <br/>Molineux officials have since gone back to the outside agency, who recommended Malook's latest company.</p>

      <p>A previous business Fat Cat Gaming was launched in 2015 by crowd-funding platform fundedbyme with an investment of £8,500 in return for a 1% stake.</p>
      <p>It promised users a free-to-play mobile game, called Lucky 6 but all hyper-links to its sites have been disabled.</p>
      <p>Angry bloggers claim they were encouraged to promote the game in India in exchange for shares which were either worth little or tough to cash in.</p>
      <p>Fundedbyme were contacted by MirrorSport and claimed not to have been in contact with Malook for “many years”.</p>
      <p><i>Mirror Sport</i> phoned Mr Malook for comment and he said: “I have done a contract with Wolves and signed it on behalf of our company (Ofertas365).</p>
      <p>“I have paid them. A lot of people are very happy with it and I am happy with it.</p>
      <p>“We don't have a UK gambling licence but we aren't doing business in the UK.”</p>
      <p>Wolves earlier announced the deal with Steve Morton, head of commercial at Wolves, stating: “We’re delighted to partner with Crypto Millions Lotto, an ambitious company that is keen to increase its exposure with the help of Wolves’ global reach across various platforms.</p>
      <p>“We’re also excited to develop our relationship, which will also see the Wolves brand reach new audiences in Eastern Europe and South America.”</p>
