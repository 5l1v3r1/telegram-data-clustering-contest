      <p><b>DETROITÂ (AP)</b> - A jury has acquitted a Pittsburgh-area elected official of disturbing the peace but couldn't reach a verdict on a felony charge of obstructing police at a Detroit hotel.</p>
      <p>Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner was accused of interfering with police as officers tried to remove her husband, Khari Mosley, from the Westin Book Cadillac hotel last March. They were in Detroit to attend a concert.</p>
      <p>The jury delivered the verdict Wednesday. It's not known if Wagner will face a second trial.</p>
      <p>Hotel staff had called 911 to report that Mosley was alone and unruly in the bar.</p>
      <p>Police say Wagner was drunk in her room and that she boasted about her job. She denied being drunk during her testimony Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Wagner, a Democrat, was recently re-elected to a third term.</p>
