      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/prince-andrew">Prince Andrew</a> is stepping back from public duties in the wake of the BBC interview he gave about his ties to billionaire paedophile <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York said it had become clear to him in recent days that his association with the late convicted sex offender had become a “major distraction” to the royal family’s work.</p>
      <p>The prince said he regrets his association with Epstein and “deeply sympathises” with his victims.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-queen">The Queen</a> gave him permission to “step back from public duties for the foreseeable future”, Andrew said in a statement.</p>
      <p>He also said he was “willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required” over the Epstein probe.</p>
      <p>Andrew has been heavily criticised for his performance in the TV interview on Saturday, in which he failed to express concern for Epstein’s victims.</p>
      <p>He appeared to show no remorse for his close association with the convicted sex offender, who had abused many underage girls.</p>
      <p>Pressure has been mounting in the days since the interview, with firms including BT and Barclays among a number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities which have distanced themselves from Andrew.</p>
      <p>In his statement, issued by Buckingham Palace, he said: “It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.”</p>
      <p>The duke added: “I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>

      <p>“I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”</p>
      <p>In the <i>Newsnight</i> interview, the duke denied claims he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, on three separate occasions – twice while she was underage.</p>
      <p>He said the alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
      <p>Ms Giuffre said the same alleged sexual liaison began with the duke sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp.</p>
      <p>But the duke said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat. He said he had no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre.</p>
      <p>When asked by the BBC’s Emily Maitlis if he regretted the “whole friendship with Epstein”, the duke replied: “Now, still not and the reason being is that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful.”</p>
