      <p>A head teacher has been jailed for two-and-a-half years after making and publishing depraved child abuse images.</p>
      <p>Daniel Chapman, 31, portrayed himself as the "safeguarding champion" of a school while secretly gratifying himself with the cruel sexual exploitation of children as young as four, Essex Police said.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on Wednesday after admitting 12 offences including making indecent photographs of children, publishing obscene articles, and possessing extreme pornographic images, the force added.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Nick Riley said the six-month investigation "involved some of the most horrific social media messaging concerning child abuse that I had ever investigated".</p>
      <p>He said: "Daniel Chapman had taken it upon himself to become a safeguarding champion for the school, whilst he was simultaneously involved in activities which promoted the abuse of children, some of whom were of a similar age to those he was meant to be safeguarding.</p>

      <p>"He portrayed himself as a respectable head teacher, however, was found to have been using messaging applications and social media to engage in making, possessing and publishing indecent images of children as young as four.</p>
      <p>"I am delighted this individual is now paying the price for his appalling actions.</p>
      <p>"Every time an indecent image of a child is viewed, it re-victimises that child over and over again."</p>
      <p>Chapman, of Meadgate Avenue, Chelmsford, was also put on the sex offender's register for 10 years, given a decade-long sexual harm prevention order, and banned from teaching for life.</p>
