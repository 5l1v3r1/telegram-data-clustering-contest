      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy Sleepers: Bo Scarbrough, Derrius Guice go from waiver pickups to solid 'starts'</h1>

      <p>It's always nice when the topwaiver wire pickups lineup with weekly sleepers list. That means that those of you who rushed out to pick up Bo Scarbrough and Derrius Guice (or picked up Guice a few weeks ago, when we first started suggesting it) can slide them right into your Week 12 fantasy lineup. That makes for easiereasy start 'em, sit 'em decisions at the running back spot, if nothing else.</p>
      <p>This week's sleeper list also includes a quarterback and defense playing against each other, and it actually makes sense. Sam Darnold and the Jets offense should continue to score some points against Oakland, but Darnold and company are also susceptible enough to sacks and turnovers to make the Raiders D/ST profitable.</p>

      <p>We also are targeting the Steelers' matchup this week in Cincinnati. The Bengals don't have any especially strong areas of their defense, so we believe in both the Pittsburgh running game and potentially James Washington (if he's the No. 1 WR for Pittsburgh this week). We also return to the Raiders game on the other side of the ball, expecting good things out of Hunter Renfrow.</p>
      <p>And we shouldn't forget to point out the triumphant return Baker Mayfield makes to the sleepers list. He's been a bust a number of times for us this year, so it will be refreshing for him when he surely reads our articles on Saturday night tofind himself as a sleeper this time around.</p>

      <p>Kalen Ballage saved our trust in him a week ago by finding the end zone. The same cannot be said for James White or Brian Hill, though. Nick Foles disappointed, too, but he was offset by a good pick on Sam Darnold and his career-high four passing touchdowns. We also didn't hit on Tre'Quan Smith or Auden Tate, and tight end was pretty much a wasteland. We're definitely due for some positive regression this week.</p>

      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Sleepers: Running backs</h3>
      <p><b>Derrius Guice, Redskins vs. Lions (Billy Heyen). </b>The Lions allow more fantasy points to running backs than any other team, and after an eight-touch return from injury (and a touchdown), it would make sense for Guice to rise up to 12-15 touches, which is enough to have solid fantasy value in this matchup.</p>
      <p><b>Bo Scarbrough, Lions @ Redskins (Vinnie Iyer).</b>The trust factor is really hard here with Matt Patricia’s revolving backfield, but he ran well enough to be the power back of choice in a great matchup.</p>
      <p><b>Benny Snell Jr./Trey Edmunds, Steelers @ Bengals (Matt Lutovsky).</b>A few thingshave tohappen for either of these guys to pay off. First, James Conner (shoulder) needs to be out. Second, Snell (knee) needs to be healthy. If that happens, he could easily get more carries that Jaylen Samuels, who will still be involved and have more PPR value. But given the Bengals horrible run defense, 10-plus carries can yield FLEX value in standard leagues. If Snell is also out, Edmunds would be in that spot and be worth a look.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football Sleepers: Quarterbacks</h3>
      <p><b>Jeff Driskel, Lions @ Redskins (Heyen). </b>Driskel has averaged 25.5 fantasy points per game (FPPG) across the past two weeks. Now he gets to face a Redskins defense that is simply bad across the board. The Lions don't have much of a running game (besides Driskel's legs), so expect him to have plenty of weight on his shoulders to produce.</p>
      <p><b>Baker Mayfield, Browns vs. Dolphins (Iyer).</b>He’s back in the weekly starting conversation as the offense has looked solid the past two games, and this is a great spot.</p>
      <p><b>Sam Darnold, Jets vs. Raiders (Lutovsky).</b>After a decent showing in Week 10, Darnold broke out in Week 11, throwing for 293 yards and four scores against the Redskins. The Raiders come to town in Week 11, and they’re tied for seventh in FPPGallowed to QBs. Darnold will come through again in this spot.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football Sleepers: Wide receivers</h3>
      <p><b>Hunter Renfrow, Raiders @ Jets (Heyen). </b>The Jets allow a ton of fantasy points to receivers, and Renfrow has turned himself into a solid floor player week in and week out. As long as bye weeks are still going, a player with Renfrow's floor can be useful.</p>
      <p><b>Allen Lazard, Packers @ 49ers (Iyer). </b>Here’s taking a shot on him being busy on Sunday night as Green Bay's probable new No. 2.</p>
      <p><b>James Washington, Steelers @ Bengals (Lutovsky).</b>There isn’t much to like about the Steelers’ passing game, but withJuJuSmith-Schuster (concussion, knee) and Diontae Johnson (concussion) banged up, Washington has a chance to continue his late-season “surge." In truth, that hasn’t resulted in huge stats, but he’s received consistent targets and is averaging 16 yards per catch. He could be the de facto No. 1 receiver this week, and that alone gives him value against a bad defense.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football Sleepers: Tight ends</h3>
      <p><b>Dallas Goedert, Eagles vs. Seahawks (Heyen). </b>This pick is even better if Alshon Jeffery (ankle) is out. Goedert is the second-best receiver Philadelphia has behind Zach Ertz in that scenario, meaning his floor is as high as can be for a No. 2 tight end.</p>
      <p><b>Cameron Brate, Buccaneers @ Falcons (Iyer).</b>O.J. Howard looks ready to be removed from the passing equation, and Jameis Winston rekindled his connection with Brate last week. They can do more damage together in the middle of the field.</p>
      <p><b>Benjamin Watson, Patriots vs. Cowboys (Lutovsky).</b>The Cowboys allow the fifth-most FPPG to TEs, and Watson was more involved in the Pats offense last week, catching four-of-five targets for 52 yards. Tom Brady will have a tougher time getting the ball to his wide receivers in this matchup, making Watson and James White the most likely safety valves.</p>
      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Sleepers: Defenses</h3>
      <p><b>Tennessee Titans vs. Jaguars (Heyen). </b>Nick Foles looked terrible in Week 11, so I'm happy to assume it'll happen again. The Titans have enough good individual defenders to believe in their defensive abilities overall regardless.</p>
      <p><b>Detroit Lions @ Redskins (Iyer).</b>They preyed on another NFC East rookie quarterback in Week 8 with a scoop-and-score fumble recovery against Daniel Jones, and Dwayne Haskins should make several mistakes here.</p>
      <p><b>Oakland Raiders vs. Jets (Lutovsky).</b>The Raiders will give up yards and points, but they can also get sacks (five in each of the past two games) and takeaways (at least two in each of the past three games). Sam Darnold is always loose with the ball, so this is a situation where both the QB and the defense facing him can produce in fantasy.</p>
