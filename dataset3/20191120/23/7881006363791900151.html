      <p><b>CHENNAI:</b> DMK president M. K. Stalin slammed the AIADMK government for coming out with an ordinance for holding indirect election to posts of mayors of municipal corporations and chairpersons of municipalities, saying the “despotic” decision was made as the AIADMK government was unable to hold the local bodies elections in a democratic manner.</p>
      <p>Averring that the Edappadi Palaniswami government went back on its earlier decision to hold direct elections, Mr. Stalin said few days ago the Chief Minister (Edappadi K. Palaniswami) asserted that there was no change in the system of holding direct elections to mayors’ post. And even Deputy Chief Minister (O. Panneerselvam) had claimed that there was no move to alter the existing system.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But media reports indicted that the State Cabinet had on Tuesday decided to favour indirect elections for mayoral posts. This decision has been taken in a despotic manner as the AIADMK finds itself unable to hold the local bodies elections in a democratic manner,” Mr. Stalin claimed.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters on Wednesday after chairing his party’s emergency meeting on the government ordinance, he said indirect election to mayors’ post is anti-democratic. “You may ask whether we had not held indirect elections?. The political situation was then different, as the civic bodies could not function independently. Today, the local bodies are functioning independently. There is no need for indirect elections for mayors and chairpersons of corporations and municipalities,” he said condemning the move.</p>
      <p>Probably, the AIADMK’s decision hinged on its assumption that it has the backing of the people, especially after it won in two by-polls. “But unlike the AIADMK, we have faith on the people. Whether its direct or indirect election, we are ready to face it. The DMK will emerge victorious in the local bodies elections,” Mr. Stalin said.</p>
      <p>TNCC chief K. S. Alagiri too flayed the government saying it was against democratic norms to hold indirect election. DMK allies: the left parties and MDMK too condemned the government’s decision.</p>
