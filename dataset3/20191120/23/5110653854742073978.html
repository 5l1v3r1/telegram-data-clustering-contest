      <h1>Recent trend suggests winner of 49ers vs. Packers on Sunday night will win Super Bowl</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:57:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>The winner of Sunday night's 49ers-Packers game in San Francisco will win the Super Bowl this season.</p>
      <p>That is, as long as one trend associated with such a rare late-season matchup continues.</p>
      <p>The 49ers, entering Week 12 with the NFC's best record at 9-1, are facing the 8-2 Packers. According to the NFL, itmarks just the fifth time since 2007 that teams with two or fewer losses have played each other this late in a season. The winners of the last two such games — the Broncos in 2015 and the Seahawks in 2013 — went on to win Super Bowls at the end of those seasons.</p>

      <p>Four years ago, Denver beat a previously unbeaten New England team in overtime on Nov. 29then route to its third title. Seattle earned its first Super Bowl victory a couple months after it blew out a 9-2 New Orleans team on Dec. 2, 2013.</p>
      <p>Below are the NFL games since 2007 that have included teams with two or fewer losses in Week 12or later:</p>

      <p>Of course, the winner of Sunday night's game still faces quite a challengein order to join the Broncos and Seahawks as Super Bowl champs. According to <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/championship-winner/futures/">Super Bowl odds</a> prior to Week 12, the 49ers have the fourth-best chances to win the title this season, behind the Patriots, Ravens and Saints. The Packers have the sixth-best odds, just behind the Chiefs.</p>
      <p>For the 49ers, Sunday night's game against the Packers also marks the beginning of what could be the toughest three-game stretch this late in a season in NFL history.</p>
      <p>As ESPN's Nick Wagoner <a href="https://twitter.com/nwagoner/status/1196868928145907717?s=20">points out</a>, no team in the Super Bowl era has ever faced three straight opponents with a winning percentage of .800 or better this late in a season. After Green Bay, San Francisco draws 8-2 Baltimore on the road in Week 13, then 8-2 New Orleans, also on the road, in Week 14.</p>
      <p>In order to maintain records of .800 or better prior to their games against the 49ers, the Ravens need to beat the Rams this week, and the Saints need to beat the Panthers and Falcons over the next two weeks.</p>
      <p>The Packers, who would take over the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoff picture with a win over the 49ers, enter Sunday night's game as three-point road underdogs, basically making this crucial game a toss-up in the eyes of oddsmakers.</p>
      <p>As for Sporting News' predictions for 49ers vs. Packers, we're split in our picks against the spread and picks straight up. Below are the explanations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/1tjq0ocrnmrlb1hzigphiidlly">49ers vs. Packers pick against the spread</a>:The Packers will have Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones coming off a bye to attack a 49ers defense that has shown more vulnerability against offenses with athletic quarterbacks and quick backs. But Green Bay hasn't played the run well all season, and the diversity and versatility of San Francisco playing off that strength will be difficult to defend. The 49ers have more viable weapons among their backs, wideouts and tight ends for Jimmy Garoppolo than Matt LaFleur can effectively deploy for Rodgers on the road. In this big game under the spotlight, the Niners will barely have the Packers' number. <i>Pick: 49ers win 30-27 and cover the spread</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-predictions/1o5rmt44twusm1xkrsyqxe4efs">49ers vs. Packers pick straight up</a>:This is a big one for the NFC playoff picture. Should the 49ers lose to the Packers and give up the inside track to the No. 1 seed, they would be in trouble given their tough schedule over the next few weeks. San Francisco, which up to this point has taken advantage of a relatively light schedule, looks better than Green Bay statistically, but Rodgers and Co. are coming off a bye completely healthy. The 49ers' pass rush will make it challenging, but Rodgers will outplay Garoppolo on the national stage. <i>Pick: Packers 24, 49ers 20</i>.</p>
