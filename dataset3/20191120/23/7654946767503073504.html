      <h1>Bloomberg will drop $20M to defeat Trump in battleground states</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:18:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:18</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Campanile</a></address>
      <p>Michael Bloomberg — likely <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/michael-bloomberg-again-eyeing-2020-presidential-bid-sources/">on the verge</a> of announcing a White House bid — announced Wednesday that he will spend $15 million to $20 million on a voter registration drive in battleground states to help the Democrats defeat President Trump in the general election.</p>
      <p>The billionaire and three-term former New York City mayor touted the investment a week after he revealed plans bankroll $100 million in ads targeting Trump in battleground states</p>
      <p>“Mike is taking the fight directly to Trump where it matters most — in general election battleground states,” said Bloomberg spokesman Jason Schechter. “He did it last week through a $100 million digital ad buy. He’s doing it this week at the ballot box.”</p>
      <p>The voter registration campaign aims to enroll under-represented black, Latino, Asian and younger voters in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg backers were on the ground in Arizona this week and contacted Democratic Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>“Mayor Bloomberg’s team reached out to us to let us know they would be visiting Arizona. Arizona will be a critical state in the 2020 election — we believe the path to the presidency runs directly through Maricopa County,” Gallego said in a statement.</p>
      <p>However, she added that she “will not be endorsing any candidates until next year.”</p>
      <p>Gallego has participated in a training program for new mayors funded by Bloomberg at Harvard University.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Democratic primary will be held on March 17, two weeks after 14 states vote on March 3 — Super Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old has already filed papers to appear on the ballot in several states, including <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/bloomberg-files-paperwork-for-democratic-primary-in-arkansas/">Alabama and Arkansas</a>.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg’s staggering financial commitment to register Democratic voters and run attack ads against Trump shows he’s all in to defeat the incumbent — even if he doesn’t win the Democratic nomination, campaign sources said.</p>
      <p>The spending announcements come as Bloomberg continues to position himself for a likely run.</p>
      <p>The media mogul <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/bloomberg-apologizes-for-stop-and-frisk-police-policy/">stunned the political world</a> Sunday by apologizing for the New York City Police Department’s aggressive stop-and-frisk searches while he was mayor, after zealously defending the policy for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>He made the mea culpa during a speech at the Christian Cultural Center, one of the city’s largest African American churches in the East New York section of Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>“I can’t change history,” Bloomberg told congregants. “Today, I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong, and I am sorry.”</p>
