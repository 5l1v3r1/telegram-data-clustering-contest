      <h1>Former Browns Star Calls Out Steelers QB Mason Rudolph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:10:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph released a new statement today, addressing last week’s incident with Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns. Rudolph admitted he should have done a better job handling things.</p>
      <p>“I should’ve done a better job handling that situation,” Rudolph said today. “I have no ill will towards Myles Garrett. Great respect for his ability as a player. And I know that if Myles could go back, he would handle the situation differently.</p>
      <p>“As for my involvement last week, there’s no acceptable excuse. The bottom line is I should’ve done a better job keeping my composure in that situation and [not] fall short of what I believe it means to be a Pittsburgh Steeler and a member of the NFL.”</p>
      <p>The statement isn’t sitting well with some, including former Browns star Joe Thomas.</p>
      <p>“If we’re going to do prepared statement apologies 6 days after an incident, wouldn’t the statement being accurate be somewhat important? I mean, they had 6 days to come up with this statement and this is the best they can do?” Thomas wrote.</p>

      <p>No one is excusing Garrett’s actions, but there are some who believe Rudolph isn’t taking enough heat for his role in the on-field fiasco.</p>
      <p>Garrett, meanwhile, is expected to hear from the NFL soon regarding the appeal of his indefinite suspension.</p>
      <p>We’ll get Steelers-Browns again in two weeks, too.</p>
