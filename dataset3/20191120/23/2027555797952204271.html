      <h1>HC stays demolition of Belur Ambedkar Nagar slum</h1>

      <p>The Karnataka High Court passed an interim order staying the demolition of Belur Ambedkar Nagar slum in Yamalur.</p>
      <p>The slum at NAL Wind Tunnel road is home to over 120 families for the past 40 years.</p>
      <p>A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay S Oka and Pradeep Singh Yerur passed the order on a public interest litigation filed by Belur B R Ambedkar Nagar Residents Welfare Association which sought a stay on the scheduled demolition on Thursday by the Karnataka Slum Development Board.</p>
      <p>Clifton D’Rosario, the petitioners’ advocate, submitted that the slum — located on a 4-acre-37-gunta land — houses families belonging to the economically and socially weaker sections of society. Most of the residents are daily-wage labourers, domestic workers and auto-rickshaw drivers.</p>
      <p>The advocate said several families are second-generation residents and the children are almost entirely third-generation. He also argued that the area was declared as a slum under Section 3 of the Karnataka Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1973.</p>
      <p>The Karnataka Slum Development Board, however, put up a notice at the Anganwadi in the area, stating that as per the order of the National Green Tribunal, they have to remove encroachments on what was once a lakebed.</p>
      <p>He said the action of the board violates the petitioners’ fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>The court stayed the demolition scheduled for Thursday morning and issued notices to the slum board and the state government.</p>
