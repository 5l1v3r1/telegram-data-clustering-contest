      <p>QUEBEC - Premier Francois Legault is open to the creation of a Quebec version of Amazon, which his economy minister described Wednesday as a way to serve nationalist customers.</p>
      <p>Legault and Pierre Fitzgibbon spoke Wednesday about an “Amazon Quebec” ahead of a meeting with representatives of the online giant's Canadian division.</p>
      <p>The premier told reporters he is concerned about the lack of Quebec-made products available on Amazon and wants to make sure the company isn't just selling American products to Quebecers.</p>
      <p>The idea of a Quebec-focused platform was first floated in 2017 by businessman Alexandre Taillefer, who later became campaign director for the Quebec Liberal Party.</p>
      <p>Fitzgibbon went further then the premier, saying the province could “absolutely” invest in a Quebec platform, as long as it was sustainable.</p>
      <p>Any such platform, he added, would also have to a include a homegrown delivery mechanism to ensure goods reach their destinations quickly.</p>
      <p>“We have products, we have nationalist clients who like to buy in Quebec, so maybe it's time to look more closely at having a structure,” he said, adding that he was a big believer in Amazon's model.</p>
      <p>Fitzgibbon said Quebec has the capacity to deliver groundbreaking solutions. “I keep hammering on how we need to innovate,” he said.</p>
      <p>Legault, for his part, said his priority is finding a way to reassure Quebec suppliers.</p>
