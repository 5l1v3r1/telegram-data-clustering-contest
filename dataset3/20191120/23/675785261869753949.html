      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo hits back at claims he's 'secretly married' girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez</h1>
      <h2>The Juventus and Portugal superstar has, via his representatives, Gestifute, denied reports that he and his long-time girlfriend have tied the knot in Morocco</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:36:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:36</time> by <a rel="author">Gerard Couzens</a></address>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has denied claims that he and long-term girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez have tied the knot in a secret ceremony.</p>
      <p>Italian gossip magazine <i>Novella 2000</i> has claimed that the couple were wed in Morocco earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Those reports have since been picked up by papers and magazines in Portugal and across Europe.</p>
      <p>Novella 2000, which is promising to reveal more details, quoted a source it described as close to the couple saying: “I understood everything on August 29.</p>
      <p>“That day Cristiano went to Madeira with his lawyers and changed his will to protect Georgina as well</p>
      <p>“Before that his assets were administered by his mum Dolores.”</p>

      <p>However, representatives for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> superstar, who this week moved onto 99 international goals, have told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/20/cristiano-ronaldo-not-married-georgina-rodriguez-wedding/">TMZ Sports:</a> "He hasn't gotten married."</p>
      <p>Sources close to the footballer on Wednesday night have also described the secret wedding reports as "fake news".</p>
      <p>The couple, who have been dating since 2015, have a daughter Alana Martina, who turned two earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Georgina, born to a Spanish mum and Argentinian dad, helps raise Ronaldo’s other three children.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old model admitted in February she would love to become the 34-year-old’s wife, as she quashed rumours they were already engaged.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Spanish magazine Hola! she declared that he had yet to ask for her hand in marriage.</p>
      <p>But she admitted: “Every couple wants to get married and I would love to personally.</p>
      <p>“Right how we have priorities and a lot of responsibilities, although in the future it would be marvellous to become Cristiano’s wife.”</p>

      <p>Cristiano forged his relationship with Georgina during lock-ins at the upmarket clothes store in Madrid where she used to work.</p>
      <p>She soon became his first serious girlfriend since he broke up with Russian beauty Irina Shayk at the start of 2015.</p>
      <p>He moved her into his luxury home on a gated estate on the outskirts of the Spanish capital before setting up home with her in Turin.</p>
      <p>Speculation of a wedding comes just weeks after Ronaldo, who has been dating Georgina since 2016, revealed plans to marry.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Piers Morgan, he said: "She helped me so much. Of course I’m in love with her.</p>
      <p>"We’ll be (married) one day, for sure. It’s my mum’s dream as well."</p>
