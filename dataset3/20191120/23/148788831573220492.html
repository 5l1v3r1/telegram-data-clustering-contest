      <h1>‘RoboCop Returns’ Now in the Hands of ‘Little Monsters’ Director Abe Forsythe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:40:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ethan-anderton/" target="_blank">Ethan Anderton</a></address>
      <p><i>District 9</i> director Neill Blomkamp was previously working on a new <b><i>RoboCop</i></b> project that would act as a direct sequel to the original 1987 movie, following in the footsteps of recent retcon sequels like <i>Halloween</i> in 2018 and this year’s <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>. But <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/robocop-returns-director-neill-blomkamp-exits/">he left the project</a> towards the end of this past summer, and now a new filmmaker is jumping into the director’s chair to take over the film being called <b><i>RoboCop Returns</i></b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robocop-returns-lands-little-monsters-director-abe-forsythe-1256699">The Hollywood Reporter</a> has word that <i>Little Monsters</i> director <b>Abe Forsythe</b> is being lined up to take over as the <i>RoboCop Returns</i> director. The project has been in the works since the summer of 2018, and funnily enough, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> writer Justin Rhodes is rewriting a scrip from the original <i>RoboCop</i> scribes <b>Ed Neumeier</b> and <b>Michael Miner</b>, who are both producing and executive producing the return of Detroit’s cyborg crimefighter. The original film’s production company, Orion,  is also producing again along with <b>Richard Suckle</b> from Atlas Entertainment.</p>
      <p>Forsythe is an up and coming Australian filmmaker. You can see his zombie horror comedy <i>Little Monsters</i> on Hulu right now (a movie <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/little-monsters-review-sundance/">which is an absolute blast</a>). That’s more of a broad comedy with a lot of raunchy humor and blood, but our managing editor Jacob Hall informs me that Forsythe’s first movie, an Aussie comedy called <i>Down Under</i>, is “<span dir="auto">the kind of vicious satire you’d want in a <i>RoboCop </i></span>director.” Unfortunately, that movie never got released in the United States other than playing at Fantastic Fest some years ago</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if <i>RoboCop Returns</i> will be a direct sequel or the kind of sequel that <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> was where it also operated as a franchise reboot of sorts. Neumeier actually teased the project all the way back in January of 2018 and said this about the project:</p>
      <blockquote>“There’s been a bunch of other <i>RoboCop</i> movies and there was recently a remake and I would say this would be kind of going back to the old <i>RoboCop</i> we all love and starting there and going forward. So it’s a continuation really of the first movie. In my mind. So it’s a little bit more of the old school thing.”</blockquote>
      <p>Previously, when Neill Blomkamp was attached to direct <i>RoboCop Returns</i>, there was talk of not only bringing the original <i>RoboCop</i> suit back but possibly getting <b>Peter Weller</b> back as Alex Murphy. We’re not sure if there are any solid plans in place to make either of those things come to fruition, but we’re hoping for the best. Hopefully <i>RoboCop</i> fans are more eager to see the metal man of the law return than <i>Terminator</i> fans were for <i>Dark Fate</i> this month.</p>
