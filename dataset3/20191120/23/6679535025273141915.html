      <p>Streets of Usilampatti were deserted on Wednesday except for a few people, who had gathered near the Thevar statue in the centre of the town to protest against the State government for not releasing water for irrigation of around 3,000 acres in the 58 Canal.</p>
      <p>O. Sivaprakasam, deputy secretary, Usilampatti Taluk 58 Villages Irrigation Farmers’ Association, said that the people of this region had been protesting for 33 years for the 58 Canal to get water supply for the dry region.</p>
      <p>A total of 300 mcft of water was released through the main canal and the left and right canals to fill the rain-fed tanks in the dry areas of (31 tanks) Usilampatti and (4 tanks) Nilakottai taluks in August 2018.</p>
      <p>“The government has invested ₹100 crore in the project and despite receiving water on a trial basis, the government is yet to issue an order for permanent supply to the 58 villages as soon as Vaigai dam level reaches 67 feet,” he said. He added that the protest would continue till the government initiated talks.</p>
      <p>All shops in the town remained closed and autos did not ply. Bus services, however, remained unaffected.</p>
