      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here saw it’s second clash of the series – this time it was over crocodile feet – yes you heard that right.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a> had a little disagreement over a crocodile foot (which looked like a chicken wing), as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts and Roman Kemp won the camp a luxury meal for collecting 10 stars during the bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone is a bit cautious on how they think their food should be cooked, if it was on the outside world I may get annoyed but you can’t in here,’ Myles Stephenson began.</p>
      <p>But as the camp tucked into their meal, they all had something to say about it.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a bit like chicken-fish,’ Adele Roberts described.</p>
      <p>While Jacqueline Jossa added: ‘It was a mixture between pork and chicken but just quite hard and tough.’</p>

      <p>‘Ian everyone has had some there’s two there, go,’ Andrew added.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Come on seriously Ian.’</p>
      <p>The former footballer calmly responded: ‘I honestly don’t want no more.’</p>
      <p>It was when Andrew exclaimed: ‘Jesus the drama’ when Ian got a bit snappy (see what I did there) as he raged: ‘I said I don’t want no more f***ing crocodile.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/who-is-adele-roberts-and-what-has-the-im-a-celebrity-star-done-since-leaving-big-brother-11167584/">Adele Roberts</a> had the first clash of the series over the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">iconic Jane McDonald photo, which Adele brought in as her luxury item.</a></p>
      <p>Talking together in the main camp, Kate Garraway and Roman are talking about the picture, which Adele brought in as her ‘luxury item’.</p>

      <p>While Adele’s girlfriend Kate Holderness has since cleared up why she brought in the framed photo, the campmates where nonethewiser.</p>
      <p>But Kate saw the plus side, as Kate asked: ‘Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?’</p>
      <p>Admitting she didn’t know any, Adele said: ‘I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.’</p>
      <p>Adele then feels cornered by Myles and Roman who laugh at her, with Roman declared: ‘No one knows what she does.’</p>

      <p>As Kate backed up Adele and Jane, Roman put her on the spot, and asked her: ‘She’s a legend is she? Name a song?’</p>
