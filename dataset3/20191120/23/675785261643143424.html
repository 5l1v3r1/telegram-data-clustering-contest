      <p>New I'm A Celebrity arrival Cliff Parisi had planned a genius way to make friends in the jungle by bringing in contraband.</p>
      <p>But his cunning scheme has been rumbled - so he will have to get the current campmates on side in the traditional way.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actor, who is filling up on a big breakfast before he enters the jungle, fears it will be a struggle to form friendships as a newbie.</p>
      <p>Cliff said: "It is going to be tricky going in late though because they will have bonded and made friendships.</p>
      <p>"How will I make friends with them? I am going to try and bring in a bag of sweets!"</p>

      <p>The Call the Midwife is feeling guilty going into the camp late with a full stomach when everyone else will be starving.</p>
      <p>He had a long think about taking part in the show - but realised he needs the money.</p>
      <p>Cliff said: "I had always said ‘no’ to anything with the word ‘celebrity’ tagged to it,” he explains. “And I have avoided those shows like the plague!</p>
      <p>"But everyone on last year’s series was so much fun and I loved watching it. I realised it would be great fun to do. And now I am going to do it, I am hoping it will be cathartic."</p>

      <p>He added: "I do think the trials will be scary but I will still give them a go. I will try my best to win the stars."</p>
      <p>Cliff is a seasoned camper but think he may bore everyone with all of his stories.</p>

      <p>He admits: "I will be the camp bore! I am looking forward to doing it now but I know it is going to be tough.</p>
      <p>"When you have a crucial time in your life, you always have a cup of tea. To go without tea, no telly and not much food will be tough. It’s going to be hard being away from my creature comforts."</p>
      <p>As for what his colleagues on Call the Midwife will think when they find out he is swapping the popular drama for snakes and rats, he says: "They will be screaming with delight once they find out. I know they won’t be disappointed and they will be rooting for me.</p>
      <p>"In fact, I know they will be phoning up for me to do the trials! Doing I’m A Celebrity is going to be so much fun. It is going to be the best year!"</p>
