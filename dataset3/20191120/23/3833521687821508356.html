      <p>CALGARY - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. says it will acquire the Central Quebec and Maine Railway, which operates the tracks at the centre of the Lac-Megantic disaster in 2013.</p>
      <p>CP Rail and Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC, a New York investment firm, say they have entered into a definitive agreement for the nearly 800 kilometres of track that stretches to ports in Maine and Saint John, N.B. The price of the deal wasn't disclosed.</p>
      <p>The rail line encompasses the tracks that saw a runaway train hauling tanker cars loaded with volatile crude oil break loose on July 6, 2013, and barrel into Lac-Megantic, where it derailed and exploded into a massive ball of fire that consumed much of the downtown core and killed 47 people.</p>
      <p>The line remains under scrutiny, with Transport Canada recently flagging more than 250 defects on the tracks. In September, a group of Lac-Megantic residents sought an injunction to block the shipment of dangerous goods in the area pending repairs, while a coalition of municipalities has called on the federal and provincial governments to take further steps toward track safety.</p>
      <p>Transport Canada says the railroad operator has notified it that the problems have been fixed. Nonetheless, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada announced a derailment last weekend in Bolton West, Que. It said no there were no injuries or dangerous goods released.</p>
      <p>CP Rail says the deal is expected to close at the end of 2019 and remains subject to customary closing conditions.</p>
      <p>A subsidiary of Fortress Investment Group LLC bought the bankrupt Montreal Maine and Atlantic Railway for US$17 million in 2014.</p>
