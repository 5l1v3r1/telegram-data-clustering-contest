      <p>This is the eleventh locally transmitted dengue fever case in Miami-Dade County in 2019 and the 13th case reported in the state of Florida (one case reported each in Broward and Hillsborough Counties).</p>
      <p>Dengue is a virus spread through mosquito bites through the <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes which also spread chikungunya and Zika virus. Most people infected with dengue have mild or no symptoms. Those that do develop symptoms recover after about one week.</p>

      <p>The common symptoms of dengue are fever and one or more of the following symptoms: headache; eye pain (typically behind the eyes); muscle, joint, or bone pain; rash; nausea and vomiting; or unusual bleeding (nose or gum bleed, small red spots under the skin, or unusual bruising). Severe dengue can occur resulting in shock, internal bleeding, and death. If you or a family member develop the mentioned symptoms, visit your health care provider or local clinic.</p>
