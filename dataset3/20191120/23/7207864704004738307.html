      <h1>Congratulations! DNA Proves Hunter Biden is a Father</h1>
      <h2>Is it a boy?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:49:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:49</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Margaret Olohan</a></address>
      <p>DNA test results confirmed Wednesday that Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, is the father of former basketball player Lunden Alexis Roberts’s baby, The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.</p>
      <p>Hunter Biden is the father of Lunden Alexis Roberts’s baby, a motion filed Wednesday in Independence County on behalf of Roberts <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/20/dna-test-shows-hunter-biden-father-arkansas-womans/">shows</a>.</p>
      <p>The motion <a href="https://media.arkansasonline.com/news/documents/2019/11/20/191119_Motion_to_Seal_02578_cwl_cwl2X.pdf">stated</a> “that DNA testing has established with scientific certainty” that the defendant is the father of the plaintiff’s child and that Hunter Biden “is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.”</p>
      <p>Roberts said the baby’s “paternal grandfather, Joe Biden, is seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States of America,” and is considered “by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Documents filed by Roberts’s attorney Clint Lancaster show Hunter Biden eventually agreed to take a DNA test that confirmed his paternity, The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.</p>
      <p>The Trump Team congratulated 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden on his new paternity in a Wednesday tweet, saying, “Congratulations, Joe Biden!”</p>
