      <h1>James Wiseman's five-figure donation may be tougher than NCAA suspension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:22:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:22</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gatto</a></address>
      <p>The NCAA on Wednesday announced two penalties against Memphis freshman James Wiseman for his family receiving $11,500 from current Tigers coach Penny Hardaway in 2017, when Hardaway was coaching high school basketball in Memphis, and for playing in three games while ineligible.</p>
      <p>The first: Wiseman must sit out the Tigers' next 11 games aspart of a 12-game suspension (Memphis announced it was appealing the ban). The second, and perhaps the more Draconianone: Wiseman must repay that $11,500 in a donation to "a charity of his choice."</p>
      <p>How, exactly, will Wiseman and/or his family will come up with the cash between now and whenever the NCAA wants the money to be paid? It may be unwise to speculate, given that outsiders don't know the Wiseman family's finances. It's not irrational, though, to think Wiseman will need to be careful with the sourcing, lest he again run afoul of the NCAA and put Hardaway's program in further jeopardy.</p>

        <b>DeCOURCY: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-basketball/news/james-wiseman-ncaa-eligibility-questions-memphis-basketball/rx84r9z4b9kr1c7dcbr6c2365">Explaining Wiseman's NCAA eligibility case</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps the NCAAwill allow the 7-1 Wiseman to make the donation after he signs his first NBA contract next year. Wiseman is considered a lottery pick, and maybe even the top selection, so he would likely be able to afford it then. If the NCAA wants it done this season, however, that could be tough. (<b>UPDATE:</b> As SN's <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-basketball/news/memphis-discovers-the-cost-for-fighting-ncaa-over-james-wisemans-eligibility-may-be-exorbitant-penny-hardaway-north-carolina/1u9naeortijht1hz8fs1ws6cd1">Mike DeCourcy notes, pointing to NCAA rules</a>, Wiseman has "through the duration of his eligibility." The assumption, though, is that he will enter the NBA Draft next spring.)</p>
      <p>As always, the internet has some friendly advice, and a warning of sorts:</p>
