      <p>BAGHDAD: A fractured spine, paralyzed leg, hole in the back: Hamza took to the streets of Iraq’s capital to demand a better life but now he has even less than ever.</p>
      <p>“This is my sacrifice for Iraq,” said the 16-year-old, his strained voice barely audible over the phone in Baghdad.</p>
      <p>“If I could walk, I would be back in the protests now.”</p>
      <p>Hamza is one of at least 3,000 people who have been maimed in Baghdad and southern Iraq since anti-government protests erupted on Oct. 1, according to the NGO Iraqi Alliance for Disabilities Organization (IADO).</p>
      <p>The staggering number is the latest burden for a country already struggling with one of the highest disability rates in the world, according to the UN.</p>
      <p>After decades of back-to-back conflicts, Iraq is in the thick of its largest and deadliest grassroots protest movement, with more than 300 people dead and 15,000 wounded.</p>
      <p>To disperse protesters, security forces have used tear gas, rubber bullets, flash bangs, live rounds and even machine-gun fire — all of which can seriously maim or even kill, as Hamza learned.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 4, the teenager was among around 20 protesters wounded by live fire in Baghdad.</p>
      <p>A bullet pierced Hamza’s stomach and exited through his back, leaving a gaping hole.</p>
      <p>Two others hit his legs.</p>
      <p>By the time he arrived at a nearby hospital, he had lost liters of blood and his heart was failing, said his father, Abu Layth.</p>
      <p>Doctors revived the boy with a defibrillator, injected him with four units of blood and rushed him into surgery.</p>
      <p>“He was basically dead. The doctors brought him back to life,” he said.</p>
      <p>CT scans and medical reports shared by Hamza’s family revealed multiple fractures to his lower spine, leading to paralysis in his right leg.</p>
      <p>After more than a week in hospital, the teenager has gone back home and is on steady doses of analgesics.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes he screams from pain at night,” his father said.</p>
      <p>Iraq has a long history of bloody conflict, from the 1980-1988 war with its neighbor Iran to the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein and the fight against Daesh.</p>
      <p>Each war has killed tens of thousands and left even more Iraqis impaired for life.</p>
      <p>The government’s Central Statistical Organization says that in the wake of decades of conflict, more than 2 million of Iraq’s 40-million population are disabled people entitled to state support.</p>
      <p>But IADO and other rights groups say the real number sits at more than 3 million — and counting.</p>
      <p>“The number of disabled people continues to grow ... We exit<br/>one crisis and enter another,”<br/>said IADO head Muwafaq Al-Khafaji.</p>
      <p>He told AFP his group’s estimate of 3,000 maimed since Oct. 1 is an approximation, as the government is either not documenting or not releasing precise figures.</p>
      <p>To fill the gap, IADO<br/>members have been contacting hospitals and reaching out to families in Baghdad and<br/>southern cities.</p>
      <p>Although Iraq is party to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, disabled people suffer from poor health services, lack of job opportunities and social exclusion.</p>
      <p>They have organized their own rallies in Baghdad as part of the larger protest movement, demanding more support from the government.</p>
      <p>“Infrastructure in Iraq is not even equipped to meet the needs of the non-disabled,” said Khafaji. “We need more than just ink on paper.”</p>
      <p>Iraq suffers from an extremely dilapidated health care system, with hospitals severely under-equipped and doctors threatened on the basis of political or tribal disputes.</p>
      <p>In the protests, rights groups have documented the abduction of volunteer medics as well as arrests of protesters from medical facilities.</p>
      <p>The additional strain on both patients and doctors means wounded demonstrators do not get quality care quickly enough, leading to severe wound infections.</p>
      <p>Medics have even had to sever limbs to save protesters’ lives, said Farah, a 19-year-old medical student volunteering in Baghdad’s main protest camp of Tahrir (Liberation) Square.</p>
      <p>Tahrir is full of makeshift clinics treating protesters, including 30-year-old Ali, who wears a bandage where his right eye should be.</p>
      <p>On the night of Oct. 24, the father of four was on a nearby bridge when he heard shots ring out and saw hundreds of protesters scrambling away in panic.</p>
      <p>Before he could do the same, a flash bang exploded at his feet and he collapsed, regaining consciousness an hour later in a nearby hospital.</p>
      <p>But Ali could only open his left eye, as his other had been lost to a piece of shrapnel.</p>
      <p>“They want to deter protesters, but we’re becoming even more determined,” he said, as crowds of bandaged men walked around him.</p>
      <p>“The Iraqi people have endured everything. We were born to die.”</p>
