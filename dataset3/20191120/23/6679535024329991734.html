      <p>The hallways of Tirumalai Nayak Palace were abuzz with students from various schools as they lost themselves amidst the pillars, here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The students who visited the palace as part of World Heritage Week said that they were looking forward to seeing the jewels and armoury used by the Nayak rulers and added that they were informed of the importance of the week ahead of their arrival to the monument that morning.</p>
      <p>A board outside the mahal announced that entry could be gained for free into the monument from November 19 till November 25 to the palace.</p>
      <p>Officials from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Madurai said that the rule applied to all sites managed by them.</p>
      <p>“It is a nation-wide move to raise awareness about our rich heritage,” an ASI official said.</p>
      <p>However, despite the confirmation from the department, few tourists said that they were aware of the celebrations.</p>
      <p>Santosh Mengle who had travelled to Madurai from Mumbai said that he was touring the South as part of a packaged service.</p>
      <p>“Our tour guides charged us for entry even before we came here. Only then did we read the sign stating that entry is free. We have asked the service to return our money for the sites,” he said.</p>
      <p>His wife, Jyothi, said that if ASI takes to social media about such an initiative, more tourists will visit such places and inform friends and family.</p>
      <p>“After all, this city is filled with history. Well informed local guides, pamphlets or even gift shops can increase their [ASI’s] revenue, making Madurai a fantastic destination,” she said.</p>
      <p>She added that as an employee at a private travel website, free entry into monuments would help in tourist retention too.</p>
      <p>Tamar Abadi, a tourist from Israel said that a guided map of places close to the Tirumalai Nayak Palace would help her navigate easily. “This monument looks fantastic. I would love to see more. It is fitting that free entry is given to this palace. If we are intimated about other places for foreigners to gain free entry, it would be useful,” she said.</p>
      <p>An official from the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department in-charge of the Palace said that drawing and painting competitions were held last year to celebrate World Heritage Week but since local body polls may be soon approaching, senior officials have asked for the celebrations to be low-key.</p>
      <p>“To compensate, we are hosting a five-day workshop in six cities across the State on epigraphy and archaeology in December,” he said. He added that despite the lack of advertisement, thousands visited the palace over November 19 and 20.</p>
