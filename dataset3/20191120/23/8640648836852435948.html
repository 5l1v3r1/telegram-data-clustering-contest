      <p>ALAMEDA, Calif. — That the Raiders season-high three-game winning streak coincides with their league leading plus-5 turnover ratio over that time is no surprise.</p>
      <p>Throw in the fact they’ve feasted off the seven turnovers — including five interceptions — by scoring 24 points and it’s no coincidence they are in the race for the AFC West title.</p>
      <p>“The pass rush usually plays a big role in that,” coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. “Pressure on the quarterback. And we’ve had a lot more pressure on the quarterback and it’s I think helped in gaining turnovers.”</p>
      <p>The manner in which the Raiders are forcing turnovers and the synergy and trust being created on the front and back ends of the defense.</p>
      <p>The Raiders have increased pressure on the quarterback. The 12 sacks they’ve generated over the last three games — fourth-best in the NFL in that time — reflects how relentlessly they are generating pass-rush heat. They also have the fourth-highest quarterback pressures with 36 and their 19 quarterback hits is tied for 11th in the NFL.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of guys back there that can make plays,” said Raiders rookie defensive end Maxx Crosby, who had a career-high four sacks on Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals. “And it comes down to us making the quarterback get rid of the ball. That’s what we’ve been doing.”</p>
