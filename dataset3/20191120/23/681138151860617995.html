        <b>THIS IS NOT A DRILL</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ipswich Town have won an FA Cup game. I repeat, Ipswich Town have won an FA Cup game. This is not a drill.</p>
      <p>It's only taken 16 games and 3,601 days. In the end, relegation, entering at the first round stage and a last-gasp goal in a replay at Lincoln finally lifted the curse.</p>
      <p>It looked for all the world like we were heading for extra-time. Lincoln had the better of the first half but were simply not clinical enough. Ipswich played much better after the break without ever really creating any golden openings.</p>

      <p>Then, in the fourth and final minute of stoppage-time, Alan Judge was alert when tired opponents switched off at the death, ramming home the winner in front of 607 jubilant away fans.</p>
      <p>It was his first goal in 46 games for club and country. It's a moment that will hopefully kick-start his season, the attacker having admitted recently that he's been well-below his self-set high standards.</p>

        <b>LONELY UP TOP</b>

      <p>Why do Town's lone strikers always look so lonely?</p>
      <p>When you play one up front, it helps if that striker is a bone fide target man. Will Keane is not that.</p>
      <p>The former Hull City striker was lightweight and isolated against two big centre-backs. That didn't give the wingers anything to feed off. In the first half, the midfield was too deep.</p>
      <p>By contrast, Lincoln's lone forward, John Akinde, was powerful and energetic. He won headers, ran deep to win possession and provided a focal point for his team-mates to work off.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Thankfully for Town, the lower league journeyman didn't have his shooting boots on. He dragged a gilt-edged chance wide in the 15th minute and saw a one-on-one opening saved by Tomas Holy's legs soon after the restart.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MIXED BAG</b>
      </p>
      <p>This was yet another curate's egg of a performance from Toto Nsiala.</p>

      <p>He produced some strong tackles, brave headers and well-read interventions, but also some of those heart-in-mouth moments that always seem to blot his copy book.</p>
      <p>Twice in the first half he presented attempted crossfield passes straight to Bruno Andrade, with the lively left-winger seeing a shot deflected behind following the second gift.</p>
      <p>There was worse to come when, under pressure, he left a back pass short. Tomas Holy got there ahead of the on-rushing Ellis Chapman, but only just.</p>
      <p>Holy, back in the side after a three-game stint for Will Norris, produced some solid stops when called upon. He produced smart reactions to keep out Jake Hesketh's close-range effort just before the winner.</p>

      <p>Janoi Donacien had a solid game at right-back, Myles Kenlock less so at left-back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MAKING A NAME FOR HIMSELF</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a shame to see Brett McGavin limp off in the 65th minute.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Following on from an impressive senior debut in last week's EFL Trophy loss at Colchester, the homegrown 19-year-old furthered his reputation with another mature display.</p>
      <p>Sitting between midfield and defence, everything he does is calm and assured.</p>
      <p>Town aren't exactly short of central midfielders, but he may well have forced his way into the first team picture just as his former Bury Town loanee team-mate Jack Lankester did last season.</p>

        <b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Remember that League One thing that Ipswich play in? Seventeen days on from the 1-0 win at Rochdale, Town host Blackpool on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Eight senior players - Will Norris, Luke Chambers, Luke Garbutt, Cole Skuse, Flynn Downes, Jon Nolan, Kayden Jackson and James Norwood - were all left behind in Suffolk tonight with that significant second versus fifth fixture in mind.</p>
      <p>So will the squad rotation gamble pay off? In a drive to keep fringe players sharp and happy, there is a serious danger of deconditioning key men.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Of the aforementioned seven outfield players, only Downes (90 minutes v Lincoln in game one) and Norwood (four minutes v Lincoln in game one) have played since victory at Spotland.</p>
      <p>Let's hope they all looked rested rather than rusty because there's a big month ahead.</p>
      <p>After Blackpool, it's league leaders Wycombe (h), an EFL trophy trip to Peterborough, then third-place Coventry (a) followed by Bristol Rovers (h) and Portsmouth (a).</p>
