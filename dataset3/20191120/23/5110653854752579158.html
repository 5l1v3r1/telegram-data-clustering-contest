      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy RB Rankings: Ezekiel Elliott falling, but still in our top 10</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:33:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:33</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>If you like watching star running backs play, does Week 12 have the game for you! The No. 1 back in our Week 12 fantasy RB rankings for Week 12, Christian McCaffrey, takes on our No. 2 RB, Alvin Kamara, in Panthers vs. Saints. If you're like me and drafted Ezekiel Elliott second in your fantasy football draft (after Saquon Barkley), it's a perfect opportunity to kick yourself for not taking a chance on McCaffrey or even Kamara. With Barkley's injury issues and Zeke's overall ineffectiveness, every top fantasy drafter would feel a lot better about themselves if they had just taken a chance and drafted CMC.</p>
      <p>It will feel even worse when you watch Elliott get stonewalled by the Patriots this week. Enough self-loathing, though -- you and I both will have to save our weeks through running backs further down the rankings. Maybe that will be Phillip Lindsay, who for the first time all season was the much more utilized back relative to Royce Freeman. Lindsay doubled his teammate in carries, 16-8, and averaged more yards per tote, too.</p>

      <p>Or maybe the waiver wire will be your best running back friend this week. There you can snag Jonathan Williams as he fills in for Marlon Mack (hand) on Thursday night or give former Alabama back Bo Scarbrough a try as he seems to be the flavor of the week for the Lions. Derrius Guice has also returned and should see at least half of Washington's backfield touches against a Detroit defense waiting to be run all over.</p>

      <p>Things fall off quickly after some of those potentially available options, although it wouldn't be a late-season RB rankings if we didn't pay homage to Kalen Ballage (who's also available in a lot of leagues). He carried nine times for nine yards and caught five passes for eight yards in Week 11. Thankfully for owners relying on him, he fell into the end zone to add six points to his fantasy total. You might have to close your eyes when you play Ballage(who has a favorable matchup against the Browns), but at some level of desperation, that volume means something.</p>

      <p>Also keep an eye this week on the injury to James Conner (shoulder) in Pittsburgh. The Steelers face a vulnerable Cincinnati run defense in Week 12, which would make the combo of Jaylen Samuels and Trey Edmunds potentially useful in fantasy this week -- and Edmunds is widely available.</p>
