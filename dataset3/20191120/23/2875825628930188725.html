      <h2>A first look at the celeb jungle's newest recruits facing their first Bushtucker trial</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:04:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:04</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Two new celebs are joining the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> camp tomorrow night, and they are being thrown in at the deep end.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> actor Andy Whyment and EastEnders actor Cliff Parisi are entering the jungle for a Wild West themed trial.</p>
      <p>Ol' Dingo Town is a special town built for the trial, and will see Andy and Cliff become outlaws.</p>
      <p>Andy, who played Kirk Sutherland, and Cliff, who played Minty Peterson, will be dressed head to toe as cowboys.</p>
      <p>Over the coming days, all Bushtucker Trials will take part in Ol' Dingo Town and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way.</p>

      <p>Cliff admitted he was worried that the camp mates had already bonded and would ostracise him when he joined them.</p>
      <p>He seemed ready for the jungle's critters, declaring: "Come on you spiders! Come on you crocodiles!"</p>
      <p>Brave Andy claimed he did not have any fears or phobias, but neither did he have any survival skills.</p>
      <p>Cliff has admitted that he initially turned down the job until he was shown a huge tax bill by his accountant, which changed his mind.</p>

      <p>Cliff said: “What made me sign up? The taxman. I have got a bill I need to pay.</p>
      <p>"Like everyone at this time of year, you go, ‘Oh no. Again...' You would think I earn a lot of money but I don’t.</p>
      <p>"I work for the BBC, so it ain’t that big.</p>
      <p>“I had a meeting about this earlier on in the year, and I thought about it long and hard and said no.</p>
      <p>"And then as I got an estimate for my tax, I phoned them up and said, is it too late to say yes?</p>

      <p>“So here I am. But it could be an amazing experience and I hope it is.</p>
      <p>“Life throws up things like this for you, and if you don’t take them you are a bit of a mug.</p>
      <p>So I give myself a bit of a talking to, and then I spoke to the accountant and he made my mind up.</p>

      <p>What is the worse-case scenario? A big snake is gonna bite you or the taxman is gonna bite you. Which do you want?”</p>
      <p>Andy is not perfectly equipped to take on the jungle liftstyle and trials. He admitted: “Last time I went camping was at V Festival '99 So I’ve not been camping since 2000 and that was actually in a tent.</p>
      <p>"Now I’m actually in the outdoors in the Australian outback so that’s completely different.”</p>
      <p>But he has some experience of creepy crawlies, and said: “You could come face to face with a spider or a snake but my brother actually had a tarantula when I was a kid so I’m used to holding spiders and stuff like that.</p>

      <p>“I don’t mind snakes but if there’s a snake rearing up at you that’s a bit different.</p>
      <p>"Another one I’m a bit wary about is if you have to put your hand in and you don’t know what’s in there.</p>
      <p>"Like when Amir Khan had to put his hand in and pulled the snake out. But I’m going to have a go at everything. I am looking forward to it and just want to get in there and get on with it.”</p>
