      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Hospital consultant Dr Ravi Gowda, 51, has spoken of how his mum aya ­Thimmegowda, 71, lay crying from a stomach ulcer in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, because of staff shortages</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:51:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:51</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Thornton, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lucy-thornton/</a></address>
      <p>A hospital consultant says the NHS is at “breaking point” after his seriously ill mother was left on a trolley for 16 hours.</p>
      <p>Dr Ravi Gowda, 51, watched in horror as his “scared” mum Jaya ­Thimmegowda, 71, lay crying from a stomach ulcer, feeling “abandoned”.</p>
      <p>Both praised staff but said they were shocked at the “dangerous” shortage of doctors and beds.</p>
      <p>Blasting Tories for running down the health service to crisis point, he said: “My mum could have died. The shortage of frontline NHS staff is a risk to patients and people need to be aware of the crisis.”</p>
      <p>His mum, who spent 10 days in hospital, collapsed at home in Dewsbury, West Yorks.</p>
      <p>She said: “When I got to hospital I laid so many hours crying on a trolley. I couldn’t take it.</p>

      <p>There was not enough staff to look after all the patients and not enough beds.</p>
      <p>"Even when I got a bed I was moved twice with my drip and treatment. I can’t blame anybody, the doctors and nurses were very good.</p>
      <p>"It’s the funding. There was only one doctor.”</p>
      <p>Her son, a Labour Party member, tweeted: “She was very ill and subsequently she was on a trolley in A&amp;E for 16 hours.</p>
      <p>“This Government has chronically underresourced our NHS. That’s why in December I’ll be voting Labour.”</p>

      <p>Dr Gowda, of Warwick, said they took his mum to Dewsbury District Hospital at 8pm on October 20.</p>
      <p>But he was told they no longer admit seriously ill patients at A&amp;E and only stabilise them.</p>
      <p>Medics then called his mum an ambulance, which took 90 minutes to arrive. She was moved to Pinderfields General Hospital in Wakefield, 12 miles away, arriving at midnight.</p>
      <p>Dr Gowda said: “There are supposed to be four registrars but there was one.</p>
      <p>"I was holding vigil as I knew things could go wrong.</p>
      <p>“The staff did their very best but the cuts are hitting hard.</p>
      <p>“I left at 2.30am... I came back at noon to find she had had hardly any fluids, hardly any treatment.</p>
      <p>“She was seen by a junior doctor and had not been seen by a consultant. She got a bed about 2.30pm.”</p>
      <p>Trudie Davies, chief Operating Officer, at The Mid Yorkshire ­Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “We apologise for any distress.”</p>
