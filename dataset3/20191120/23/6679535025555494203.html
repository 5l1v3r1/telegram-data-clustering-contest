      <p>The United States official in charge of talks with North Korea says time is running short to achieve a deal, but not because of the end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un (gihm jung oon).</p>
      <p>US envoy Stephen Biegun tells the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that any crisis or other distraction could derail talks.</p>
      <p>Biegun says the window is still open but the North Koreans need to seize the moment.</p>
      <p>The envoy says Kim needs to grant more authority to his negotiating team.</p>
      <p>Biegun says the U.S. has seen no concrete evidence that North Korea intends to denuclearize.</p>
      <p>Negotiations faltered after the U.S. rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the Northâ€™s nuclear capabilities.</p>
