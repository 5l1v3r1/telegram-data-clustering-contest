      <p>On Wednesday morning, Spurs confirmed that Mourinho had been appointed as the replacement for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>, who had been removed from his position a day earlier.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese has been tasked with securing a spot in the top four of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League table</a>, with Spurs currently sitting 11 points adrift of a Champions League place.</p>
      <p>On his first day in charge of the north Londoners, <i>The Mirror</i> claims that Mourinho made an effort to hold a one-on-one chat with club captain and top goalscorer Kane.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that other senior players were spoken to ahead of Saturday's encounter away at West Ham United.</p>
      <p>Chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> has allegedly assured Mourinho that Kane will not be sold during the summer transfer window.</p>
