      <p>Fox revealed she had come to grips with her difficulties with alcohol and that she was grateful to be a few months sober.</p>
      <p>Fox shared her experience, strength and hope to all the recovering alcoholics that are currently battling their own demons. The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> veteran revealed that she had learned new skills to cope with her struggles and was thankful that she could finally get this message off her chest.</p>
      <p>Here's what Alicia Fox wrote in a very positive Instagram post:</p>
      <blockquote>For a WHILE I thought I could avoid addressing my #recovery of alcohol.

      <p>Alicia Fox has had a tough year. The Superstar reportedly arrived drunk and was allowed to wrestle at a live event in February. Arn Anderson, who was the producer of her match, was shown the door for permitting her to compete while being intoxicated.</p>
      <p>She wrestled her last match on the Main Event taping in April and has since been moved to the alumni section of the WWE website after she was spotted with the WWE Legends during the RAW Reunion show.</p>
      <p>It has been widely reported that the 33-year-old's in-ring career could be over. It was also reported that the company reached out and tried to help her deal with her alcoholism.</p>
      <p>Reports stated that she went AWOL when WWE first tried to provide her with the opportunity to get her life back on track. However, it seems Fox accepted the help that was required and is now in recovery.</p>
      <p>We're glad that Fox has taken the steps to come out of the deadly clutches of alcoholism and convey all the good wishes as she continues to be on the path of sobriety.</p>
