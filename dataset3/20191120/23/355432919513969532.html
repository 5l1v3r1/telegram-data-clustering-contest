      <h1>Tennessee becomes first state to ask permission for Medicaid block grants</h1>

      <p>Tennessee on Wednesday formally asked the Trump administration for permission to convert its Medicaid program into a limited, block grant–type model, a controversial plan that, if approved, could be the first in the nation.</p>
      <p>The proposal will test the Trump administration’s ability to allow states the flexibility to make drastic changes to Medicaid. </p>
      <p>Imposing block grants in Medicaid has long been a major conservative goal and has been encouraged by the Trump administration, but it is not clear if the administration alone has the legal authority to allow such drastic changes.</p>
      <p>Administration officials had drafted a guidance that would make it easier for states to apply for a capped payment or block grants, but the document was quietly removed from the White House Office of Management and Budget last week.</p>
      <p>No states have been granted permission to date, but if Tennessee’s plan is approved, it would likely embolden other Republican-led states. The proposal will also mobilize opposition from patient advocacy groups, who have already been protesting since the state passed a bill </p>
      <p>“This proposal represents a significant opportunity for the federal government to test a potential innovative, national solution at how to incentivize states’ performance in maximizing the value of taxpayer dollars,” the state said in its application.</p>
      <p>Republicans say policies like block grants allow for more state flexibility and are more fiscally sustainable.</p>
      <p>Critics fear a block grant would ultimately lead to states kicking people off their rolls or pulling back services. But Tennessee’s proposal is a novel one that departs from some of the more traditional block grant ideas, even as it imposes financial caps on federal spending. </p>
      <p>Under Tennessee’s proposal, the state would receive a nearly $7.9 billion block grant from the federal government, which is based on projected Medicaid costs. The amount would be adjusted for inflation, but unlike a traditional block grant, it could increase in the future based on enrollment. </p>
      <p>If enrollment drops, the block grant amount would not decrease. The state said no current TennCare members would experience a loss or rollback of benefits.</p>
      <p>Also unlike a traditional block grant, if the state spent less in a given year than it would have under the traditional Medicaid system, Tennessee would split those savings with the federal government.</p>
