      <p>Not all electric toothbrushes are created equal, and no matter how regularly you clean, some brushes are going to let you down.</p>
      <p>If dental hygiene is important to you (and it should be), we recommend investing in a quality device from a respected brand, like the <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdyd">Philips Sonicare DiamondClean</a> electric toothbrush. This mean-looking model has five cleaning modes, hidden LED controls, and a battery life of 14 days.</p>
      <p>You can now pick up the <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdyd">Philips Sonicare DiamondClean</a> electric toothbrush for just <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdyd">£99.99 on Amazon</a>. This is down by 67% in the "Countdown to Black Friday Sale," saving you £199.01. This also includes a two-year warranty and a 28-day money-back guarantee, so you are covered if things go awry. </p>
      <p>There are a bunch of other electric toothbrush deals available on Amazon right now, but this is probably the pick of the bunch. It's still on the pricier side of things, but you get a lot for your money, including a travel charger.</p>
      <p>Invest in a next-level clean with the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean electric toothbrush.</p>
