      <p>SEATTLE -- Tolling in the new SR99 waterfront tunnel is in its second week of existence and now the first toll bills are in the mail, WSDOT officials say.</p>
      <p>But if you do get a bill in the mail, it means your toll was as much as $2 more per trip than it needed to be.</p>
      <p>"Remember, drivers who choose Pay By Mail are charged an additional $2 per trip, which covers the cost of processing and mailing a bill," <a href="https://wsdotblog.blogspot.com/2019/11/the-first-toll-bills-for-sr-99-tunnel.html">writes Chris Foster with WSDOT</a>. "So any trips taken on Saturday would cost $3 each (as opposed to the Good To Go! rate of $1)."</p>
      <p>Let's say you forgot to set up an account and now you're bummed the toll is even more than you were anticipating. Sunk cost? WSDOT says no -- you can still get much of that extra toll back, even if you don't have a toll sticker or pass.</p>
      <p>"It's not too late to lower your bill, even after you receive it in the mail," Foster says.</p>
      <p>If you call the WSDOT customer service center at 1-866-936-8246 to set up a Good to Go account, you can have your existing tolls reduced to the rate for those who do have an account -- a savings of $1.75 per toll. You'll just be charged the quarter extra for not having a toll pass.</p>
      <p>Plus all future tolls would be billed at the 25-cent extra toll as opposed to the $2 mail fee.</p>
      <p>"All you have to do is call and ask," Foster says.</p>
      <p>Or, get a toll pass and pay the posted rates and dodge even the quarter fee.</p>
      <p>Foster warns those who ignore a toll bill in the mail face a $5 late fee after 15 days, and a $40 fine for each unpaid toll after 80 days. If you still want to pay by mail, just remember bills are sent to the address where the car is registered via the license plate, so make sure you have your correct address on file with the DOL and the correct license plate on file with WSDOT.</p>
