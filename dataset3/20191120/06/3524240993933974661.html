        <b>Sunday Aborisade, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Senate on Tuesday directed the Federal Ministry of Health to stop quackery in public hospitals and the issuance of fake medical reports across the country</p>
      <p>The Senate gave the directive after a debate on a motion on the proliferation of fake medical reports from public hospitals in Nigeria. The motion was sponsored by Senator Uche Ekwunife.</p>
      <p>Presenting her motion, Ekwunife cited a recent investigation which revealed the ease “authentic” medical reports could be obtained from some public hospitals in Nigeria for a fee.</p>
      <p>She said the reports could be obtained without any medical tests whatsoever or even proof of identity.</p>
      <p>She said the development could result in fatal misdiagnosis of patients or anyone relying on the contents of such medical reports.</p>
      <p>She said, “I am aware that the Code of Ethics for the medical profession abhors the illegal issuance of medical certificates and records to patients without conducting all the relevant tests.</p>
      <p>“I am aware that guidelines exist in the medical profession which prescribes these conducts, but no effective implementation of these regulations.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan,  on Tuesday administered the oath of office on Senator Ibrahim Danbaba, a  Peoples Democratic Party member representing Sokoto South Senatorial District.</p>
      <p>He replaced Shah Tambuwal of the All Progressives Congress, who was sacked by the appeal court penultimate week.</p>
      <p>The development has reduced the number of the APC senators to 63 while the PDP rose to 43.</p>
      <p>One seat is currently outstanding in Kogi West Senatorial District</p>
      <p>Lawan also acknowledged on the floor the receipt of a communication on the Aviation Sector Bills from the executive for consideration and passage into law.</p>
      <p>The communication reads, “Pursuant to Section 58 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended, I formally request that the following six bills be considered for passage into law by the Senate.”</p>
      <p>The bills, according to the Senate President includes Civil Aviation Bill 2019, Federal Airport of Nigeria Bill 2019, Nigeria College of Air Space Management Agency establishment etc 2019 and Nigeria College of Aviation Technology Establishment bill 2019.</p>
      <p>Others are Nigerian Meteorological Agency Establishment Bill 2019 and Nigerian Safety investigation Bureau 2019.</p>
