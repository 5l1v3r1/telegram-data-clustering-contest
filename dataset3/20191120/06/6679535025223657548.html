      <p>India’s Manu Bhaker and Rahi Sarnobat failed to qualify for the finals of the women’s 25m air pistol event at the World Cup Finals here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Commonwealth Games gold-medallist Manu shot 292 and 291 in the precision and rapid events respectively for a total of 583 in the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>While two other shooters, Germany’s Doreen Vennekamp and Elena Galiabovitch of Australia, also ended with a qualification score of 583, the German qualified owing to a superior tally of inner 10s.</p>
      <p>Manu and Galiabovitch had 17 inner 10s, while Vennekamp shot 23 to be way ahead.</p>
      <p>Rahi, on the other hand, endured a disappointing outing. The Asian Games gold-medallist finished bottom of the heap in the qualifiers with a score of 569.</p>
      <p>Later on Wednesday, Anish Bhanwala will compete in the men’s 25m rapid fire pistol event.</p>
