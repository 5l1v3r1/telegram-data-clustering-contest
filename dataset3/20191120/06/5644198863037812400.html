      <p>MELBOURNE: New Zealander Dave Rennie has been appointed Wallabies coach on a three-and-half-year deal that will see him lead Australia at the 2023 Rugby World Cup, Rugby Australia said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Rennie, who led the Waikato Chiefs to two Super Rugby titles, replaces Michael Cheika, who resigned in the wake of Australia's quarter-final exit from the Rugby World Cup in Japan.</p>

      <p>Rennie will fulfil his coaching commitments with Scottish side Glasgow Warriors before joining the Wallabies in July 2020, Rugby Australia (RA) said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"I've been coaching professionally for over 20 years and wherever I've gone, I've immersed myself in the community and culture. I believe I can make a difference here," Rennie said in the RA statement.</p>
