      <p>Ten PKK terrorists were killed in an air-supported anti-terror operation in northern Iraq, the Defense Ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The terrorists were killed as part of Operation Claw-3 in the Haftanin region, the ministry said.</p>
      <p>The operation also destroyed heavy ammunition and fuel used by the terrorists.</p>
      <p>Operation Claw-3 was launched on Aug. 23 to ensure security along the border, especially in southeastern Turkey's Şırnak and in northern Iraq's Sinat-Haftanin.</p>
      <p>Operation Claw has also targeted terrorist elements in Zap, Avasin, Basyan, Gara, Metina and Qandil in air and ground attacks.</p>
      <p>All three operations have secured an area of 370 square kilometers, preventing terrorists from entering Turkey or gaining a foothold in the region.</p>
      <p>On May 27, Turkey launched Operation Claw against the PKK in the Hakurk region of northern Iraq. Operation Claw-2 was launched on July 12 as a follow-up to the successful offensive.</p>
      <p>The Turkish military continues its counterterrorism efforts against the PKK, its affiliate the People's Protection Units (YPG) and Daesh both within and outside Turkey's borders.</p>
      <p>In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU, has been responsible for the deaths of some 40,000 people, including women and children.</p>
