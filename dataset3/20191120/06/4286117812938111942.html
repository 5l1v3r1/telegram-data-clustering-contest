      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Kamal Haasan has backed Rajinikanth's promise of joining hands for Tamil Nadu</li>
        <li>Haasan said, "My friend and I have agreed to work together if need be"</li>
        <li>Rajinikanth had said on Monday the two of them can come together for the welfare of Tamil Nadu</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After Rajinikanth said on Tuesday he is open to joining hands with fellow actor and colleague Kamal Haasan for the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu, now Hassan has backed the promise and said if needed the two actor-turned-politicians will come together for the state.</p>
      <p>"My friend Rajinikanth and I have agreed that if needed we will come together and work for the betterment of the people of Tamil Nadu. We can't tell when it will be," said Kamal Haasan on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He added, "The operative word here is 'if need be' and 'for the welfare of Tamil Nadu'."</p>
      <p>On Monday, Rajinikanth triggered speculation of the two immensely popular south superstars coming together in a political alignment.</p>
      <p>The first pitch was made by Kamal Haasan who on Tuesday backed superstar Rajinikanth over his comments describing Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami coming to the top post as a wonder, saying it was a "not a criticism but the reality."</p>
      <p>Rajinikanth, who has announced he would launch his political party to contest the state assembly elections due in 2021, was responding to questions from reporters on Kamal Haasan's remarks earlier.</p>
      <p>While Kamal Haasan has announced his political party Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), Rajinikanth is yet to announce a name of his party.</p>
      <p>Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan have been part of the Tamil film industry for many decades and have worked together in several films.</p>
      <p>Rajinikanth made his debut in the Tamil film Apoorva Ragangal (1975) starring Haasan and the late Srividya and 'Major' Sundarrajan in key roles.</p>
      <p>The two actors later went on to star in many movies, before both emerged icons.</p>
