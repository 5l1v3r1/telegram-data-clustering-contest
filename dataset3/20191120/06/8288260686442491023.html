      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn went head-to-head in the first of three election debates tonight.</p>
      <p>Both leaders received rounds of applause as they answered a series of questions from the audience on a range of subjects including Brexit, the NHS and the monarchy.</p>
      <p>Here are five things we have learned from ITV's head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <h3>- Brexit reigns supreme in the election debate - despite differing opinions</h3>
      <p>Mr Johnson said a vote for the Tories is a vote to "get Brexit done" as his party has a deal that is "ready to go" and backed by all 635 Conservative candidates at the election.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said the Prime Minister's pledge was "nonsense" as he repeated his promise to negotiate a new deal and hold a second referendum to let the public decide which path to follow.</p>

      <h3>- Opposing politicians can unite</h3>
      <p>Host Julie Etchingham invited the two leaders to shake hands to make a gesture to improve the nature of debate in the country.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson stepped towards Mr Corbyn's podium and the pair shook hands - a rare moment of unity in the debate.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>- They differ royally on royalty amid criticism of the Duke of York</h3>
      <p>With Andrew under continued criticism over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, both candidates were asked whether the monarchy is fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>Appearing to show restraint, Mr Corbyn replied: "Needs a bit of improvement."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: "The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."</p>

      <h3>- Both can be the butt of the joke</h3>
      <p>The PM - whose "do or die" Brexit deadline passed nearly three weeks ago - was met with laughter when he asked the audience to "look at what I've said I'm going to do as a politician and look at what I've delivered". More chuckles ensued when he said he believes the truth matters.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, who wants to hold a fresh referendum on a new Brexit deal but would not say whether he would campaign for it, tickled the audience when he said: "I've made the position clear."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>- The leaders would gift literary Christmas presents</h3>
      <p>Asked what gifts they would leave each other under the Christmas tree, Mr Corbyn said he would give Mr Johnson a copy of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens to "understand how nasty Scrooge was".</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said he would give the Labour leader a copy of his Brexit deal. But, when Etchingham urged him to give a non-political present, he said he would gift some damson jam.</p>
