      <p>A brave 100-year-old celebrated her birthday in the fast lane with an action packed go-karting experience.</p>
      <p>Margaret Mitchell turned 100 in August and has wanted to do go-karting for a long time. The four ladies went to The Experience in Glasgow for their adrenaline fuelled trip.</p>
      <p>The trip was organised by Rose Brennan, events coordinator at Parksprings care home in Motherwell.</p>
      <p>She said: “It was an awesome day out for the ladies and they loved it. The staff at The Experience treated them so well and they had the place to themselves which was also great.</p>
      <p>“Margaret doesn’t like being 100, she loves to challenge herself. I think she feels about half her age, she certainly acts it.”</p>
      <p>Margaret took three of her friends at Parksprings with her, Francis Carson, Helen Stewart and Helen Wells.</p>

      <p>They were all given nicknames on the day, High Helen, Speedy Gonzales Francis, Roadrunner Helen and Mad Margaret.</p>
      <p>Francis said “the speed was incredible and I just wanted to go faster and faster.”</p>
      <p>As part of Margaret’s 100th birthday celebrations she received a motion from Clare Adamson MSP, who came to visit her.</p>
      <p>She is also ex-RAF and has been invited to go and see some of the planes and see around one of the bases.</p>
      <p>Rosie said: “She is such a busy woman. She does so much for her age it is remarkable.</p>
      <p>“Her next plan is to go on a skydive. We are planning that just now and she is so excited.”</p>
