        <b>BORIS JOHNSON and Jeremy Corbyn traded blows over Brexit and the NHS in last night’s ITV leaders’ debate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Labour leader was laughed at by the live audience as he swerved questions on if he wants to remain in the EU and how he would campaign in a second Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>A YouGov poll of viewers after last night’s hour-long head-to-head showed Mr Johnson edging it by 51 per cent to 49 per cent.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, The Liberal Democrats launch their manifesto today, and have promised 20,000 more teachers for England and a £10bn a year spend on schools if Jo Swinson’s party is elected.</p>

The Tory press office’s @CCHQPress account was changed to “factcheckUK” during the ITV debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. Following the debate, the account was changed back to its original name, but Twitter said it would take “decisive corrective action” if it happened again.</li>

She tells ITV Election Interviews that other parties are now taking notice of the young people of today's “incredible climate movement”. Berry says she does not know who, out of Corbyn and Johnson, she would trust with sorting out “climate chaos”.</li>
