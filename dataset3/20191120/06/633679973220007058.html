      <p>A single ticket holder in the UK has won £105 million on tonight's EuroMillions jackpot</p>
      <p>The National Lottery Thunderball winning numbers are: 04, 11, 29, 34, 35.</p>
      <p>The Thunderball is 02.</p>
      <p>Tonight's EuroMillions jackpot is the first time the top prize has been scooped since October 8 when the prize reached £170 million.  </p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, said: 'On our 25th birthday, one very lucky ticket-holder has scooped tonight's entire £105 million EuroMillions jackpot.</p>
      <p>'Players across the country are now urged to check their tickets to see if they have won big.</p>
      <p>'Tonight's big winner has scooped the sixth EuroMillions jackpot banked in the UK this year.'  </p>
      <p>A UK ticket-holder won a £170 million EuroMillions jackpot in October, making them the UK's biggest ever winner.</p>
      <p>The previous biggest UK winners were Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, Scotland, who won £161 million in July 2011.</p>
      <p>A £123 million jackpot was won by a UK ticket-holder in June and a UK winner scooped £38 million in the EuroMillions in April.</p>
      <p>Ade Goodchild, from Hereford, bagged £71 million on March 15 and Patrick and Frances Connolly, from Northern Ireland, won £114.9 million on New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>According to the Sunday Times Rich List, if the jackpot was won by an individual, they will not make the top 1,000 on the list - as entry begins at £120 million. </p>
      <p>Although, they will join the likes of Donegal singer Enya, Nick Mason from Pink Floyd and Robert Plant from Led Zeppelin, who all have a fortune of around £105 million. </p>
      <p>The winner will also be more wealthy than Coldplay's Chris Martin - who is on £102 million - and the Rolling Stones' Ronnie Wood, who has an estimated £85 million.  </p>
      <h3>Who is the biggest ever UK lottery winner? Two couples and a former car mechanic top list</h3>
      <p>Here are the ten previous UK winners of the EuroMillions draw so far</p>
      <p>1. In July 2011, Colin and Chris Weir became Europe's biggest lottery winners when they scooped more than £161million.</p>
      <p>The couple, who have been married for 30 years, said they were ‘not scared’ of the wealth because they were going to have ‘so much fun’ with the money.</p>
      <p>The pair, a retired TV cameraman and a retired psychiatric nurse, from Largs, in Ayrshire, said their children Carly, a photography student, and Jamie, a call centre worker, would be bought their own homes and cars.</p>
      <p>The family made a £1million donation to the SNP shortly after winning.</p>

      <p>2. Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, took home more than £148 million in August 2012.</p>
      <p>The marriage ended just 15 months into their new jackpot winning lives, citing the stress of the money as the reason they needed to split.</p>
      <p>At the time, a spokesman for Mrs Bayford said: 'Gillian Bayford confirms that her marriage to Adrian has broken down irretrievably and they have separated.'</p>
      <p>It came after Mrs Bayford was forced to deny she had an affair with the couple's gardener, Chris Tovey. </p>

      <p>3. An anonymous ticket-holder took home £123m in July</p>
      <p>4. Patrick and Frances Connolly from County Armagh scooped the entire £115million EuroMillions jackpot on New Year's Day 2019</p>
      <p>5. An unnamed ticket-holder claimed just over £113million in October 2010, and chose not go public. </p>
      <p>6. Neil Trotter, from south London, won nearly £108million, going from former car mechanic to multimillionaire in March 2014.</p>
      <p>Neighbours in Croydon described he and partner Nicky Ottaway moved out ‘almost overnight’ after they scooped the EuroMillions jackpot last March.</p>
      <p>Mr Trotter admitted at the time that he was like his namesake, Del Boy Trotter from Only Fools And Horses.</p>

      <p>7. A couple from Cambridgeshire, Dave and Angela Dawes, won more than £101million on their third go on the EuroMillions draw in October 2011.</p>
      <p>Mr Dawes said he 'didn't sleep a wink' the night of the win, as it was too late to call Camelot after the couple checked their numbers.</p>
      <p>Last year, the couple were taken to court by his son, an Afghanistan veteran, Michael Dawes, 32, who said he was 'ungenerous in spirit'.</p>
      <p>But a judge ruled the millionaire father does not need to keep bailing out his son, who burnt through £1.6million in two years, and came back for more, failing to heed his stepmother's advice to stop eating at the Ritz and go to McDonald's instead.</p>
      <p>8. A UK winner got a £93 million payout in June 2015, but decided to remain anonymous.</p>

      <p>9. The Davies from Wales family won £61million on the EuroMillions in 2016</p>
      <p>Stephanie Davies, 23 is said to have 'reluctantly' purchased the ticket at the time after her mother Sonia called her from Florida begging her to go out and buy one.</p>
      <p>Keith Reynolds, Sonia Davies, Stephanie, Courtney Davies and Steve Powell all scooped money on the jackpot and said they were the 'luckiest people' on the planet to have won.</p>
      <p>10. Single mother Bev Doran from Shipley wins £14million in 2017</p>
      <p>After Bev won the prize it meant she was able to buy her dream home for her and her family.</p>
      <p>Bev, who is a carer for her two children who have autism had previously lived in a council house before her win.</p>
