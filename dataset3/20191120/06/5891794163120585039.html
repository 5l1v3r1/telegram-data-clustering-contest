      <p>KABUL -- The U.S. military says two of its service members have been killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The November 20 crash was being investigated, U.S. Forces Afghanistan said, adding that "preliminary reports do not indicate it was caused by enemy fire."</p>
      <p>The statement did not provide further details.</p>
      <p>The Taliban claimed it had shot the aircraft down in the Charkh district of the eastern province of Logar at 1 a.m. local time, and that "all on board were killed."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry rejected the Taliban claim, saying that "there was no involvement of the enemy fire in the helicopter crash."</p>
      <p>"No Afghan security force member is hurt," said the spokesman, Fawad Aman.</p>
      <p>The militant group regularly claims responsibility for helicopter and drone crashes without supporting evidence.</p>
      <p>Nineteen U.S. service members have died in Afghanistan in combat-related incidents since the beginning of the year.</p>
      <p>There are roughly 13,000 U.S. troops in the country, as well as thousands of European forces participating in the NATO-led Resolute Support mission.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted that U.S. troops, already in Afghanistan for 18 years, would remain there "<b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-troops-afghanistan-several-several-more-years-general-mark-milley/30262907.html">for several more years</a></b>."</p>
      <p>The helicopter crash comes a day after two Western hostages were <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/reports-taliban-commanders-land-in-qatar-as-part-of-prisoner-swap-for-western-hostages/30279695.html">released from Taliban custody</a></b> in exchange for three high-ranking Taliban prisoners, raising hopes for peace talks between the militant group and the government in Kabul.</p>
