                      <p>Jose Mourinho has been appointed as the new Tottenham manager. His contract will run until 2022/23. In a statement from the club’s website, they wrote:</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>“We are delighted to announce the appointment of Jose Mourinho as Head Coach on a contract that runs until the end of the 2022/23 season.”</i>

                        <anchor name="div-gpt-ad-ATD-TS-RES7">
                          <p>Commenting on the appointment, Chairman Daniel Levy said:</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>
                              <i>“In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>“I am excited to be joining a Club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” said Jose Mourinho. <i>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. </i><i>Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</i></p>
                            <h3>Pochettino’s fall from grace</h3>
                            <p>Despite leading Tottenham to their first ever Champions League final last season, Spurs have faltered under Pochettino this season. The North London side currently sit on 14th position with 14 points after 12 matches. In the 5 and a half years he has spent with the club, Pochettino transformed the mid-table side into a consistent Champions League side.</p>
                            <p>After a fifth-place finish in his first season, Tottenham came third, second, third and fourth in his next four full seasons in charge. The intensity and energy of the team’s pressing made Spurs stand out under Pochettino, who became one of the most sought-after managers in the world.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t bow out with grace. For all his efforts into making the club a top side, he leaves without a trophy to his name.</p>
                            <p>In a club statement on Tuesday evening, chairman Daniel Levy said:</p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions; this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the Club’s best interests.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>From the most stable manager to the most controversial; things could get really interesting for Tottenham now.</p>
