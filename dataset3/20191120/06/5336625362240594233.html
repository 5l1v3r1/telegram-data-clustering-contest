      <p>The third day of public Trump impeachment hearings took place on Thursday, though it feels as though they've been dragging on since 2016. Fortunately, <i>Late Night with Seth Meyers </i>examined some of the day's highlights for those too exhausted to watch the proceedings themselves.</p>
      <p>"The public hearings are going so badly for Trump that Republicans who spent weeks complaining the initial depositions were being held in private are now going back to saying this should all be handled behind closed doors," quipped Meyers, citing comments made by Senator Ron Johnson.</p>
      <p>Thursday's hearings were primarily concerned with the testimonies of White House advisor Jennifer Williams and decorated Iraq War veteran Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. Meanwhile, Republicans seemed primarily concerned with attempting to discredit a Purple Heart recipient.Â </p>
      <p>Based in part on his ability to speak Ukrainian, conservatives insinuated Vindman is loyal to Ukraine despite the fact he literally went to war for the U.S. This resulted in Vindman being asked if a job offer he rebuffed from a Ukrainian official was made in Ukrainian. The U.S. veteran admirably retained his composure while testifying it was made in "flawless English."</p>
      <p>"That would be memorable of course because it's rare for anyone in the Trump White House to hear someone speak flawless English," said Meyers. "I mean, Trump speaks like five words, Pence doesn't speak it at all, and I'm pretty sure Stephen Miller only communicates in demonic screams."</p>
