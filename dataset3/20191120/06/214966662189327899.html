      <p>Police are appealing for help to find the heartless attacker accused of brutally bashing an elderly widow in her Sydney retirement village unit.</p>
      <p>Patricia, 84, had just returned home from buying flowers and groceries when she found an unknown man in her bedroom around 12.30pm on Saturday 16 November.</p>
      <p>Police say the great-grandmother was assaulted by him, before he fled out the front door of the North Turramurra apartment.</p>
      <p>Emergency crews were alerted to the attack and rushed to the scene, where they found Patricia with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>She was taken to Sydney Adventist Hospital, where she continues to undergo treatment.</p>
      <p>Detectives have since established a special strike force to investigate the vicious assault and break-in, and are now appealing for anyone with relevant information to come forward.</p>
      <p>In particular, strike force detectives would like to speak with a man who was seen in the area at the time of the incident and has yet to be identified.</p>
      <p>He is described as being aged between 30 and 50, about 175-180cm tall, possibly of Asian or Indian Sub-Continental appearance, with a medium build, brown eyes, dark hair, and clean shaven. At the time, he was wearing light coloured pants and a jacket, over a button-up shirt and tie.</p>
      <p>Detectives would also like to speak with anyone who may have noticed anything suspicious in the area and ask motorists who travelled through the area to review dash-cam vision.</p>
