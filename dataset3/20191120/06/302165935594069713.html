      <p>LONDON, Nov 20 — Aston Martin, which has seen its share price plunge this year as sales failed to meet expectations after a stock market flotation, launched its first sport utility vehicle today, hoping for a turnaround in fortunes.</p>
      <p>The sports car maker, famed for being fictional agent James Bond’s car of choice, has gone bankrupt seven times in its 106-year history and has had multiple owners over the last century including Ford.</p>
      <p>Now largely owned by Kuwaiti and Italian private equity groups, Aston listed in October last year at £19 per share but that has since plunged by around 75 per cent, hit most recently by falling demand in Europe and for its Vantage model.</p>
      <p>The firm, which reported a pre-tax loss of £92 million (RM494 million) in the first nine months of the year, has ploughed money into a new factory in Wales which will build the new DBX SUV model from next year.</p>
      <p>“We’re essentially holding the cost of a complete factory right now without the benefit of the revenues coming in ... so from that point of view of course it’s a really important model,” chief executive Andy Palmer told Reuters earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Aston hopes to encourage more women buyers with its new offering and has received input from a female advisory body on the choice of certain features such as separate central arm rests and the design of the glovebox.</p>
      <p>The first trial build of the DBX has been completed with production due in the second quarter of 2020 which the company hopes will contribute to a boost to its output, alongside sports cars made at its southern English Gaydon facility.</p>
      <p>“If our volumes are slightly north of 6,000 this year, obviously you’re adding another ultimately 4 or 5,000 so it’s a big chunk of volume for us,” said Palmer. — Reuters</p>
