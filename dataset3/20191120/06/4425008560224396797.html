      <h1>Mario Shopping Kart: Nintendo unveils Tokyo store to lure casual gamers</h1>
      <h2>Step towards greater commercialisation of its cast of popular characters.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:34:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/sam-nussey-1356098" target="_blank">Sam Nussey</a></address>
      <p>Nintendo Co Ltd unveiled its first Japanese store on Tuesday in Tokyo's trendy Shibuya shopping district, in a step towards greater commercialisation of its cast of popular characters.</p>
      <p>The Nintendo Tokyo store in the fashion-focused Parco department store marks the latest move into the mainstream for Japan's gamer culture and gives Nintendo a key location to attract more casual fans.</p>
      <p>The store - previewed to the media on Tuesday ahead of its public opening on Friday - offers a range of goods featuring prized characters including Italian plumber Mario, adventurer Link and pink alien Kirby, with exclusive products from Legend of Zelda-branded ties to Animal Crossing-themed oven gloves.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto-based company will look at how the store performs before considering further openings, a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"Nintendo is a company that thinks over a very long time-horizon," said Hirokazu Hamamura, head of game magazine publisher Famitsu Group.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto-based company, which already operates a store in New York, is building on the success of the Pokemon Center retail chain, which will also have space on the 6th floor of the new Parco.</p>
      <p>That chain is managed by the Pokemon Company, which was set up with investment from gaming companies Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures to help manage the franchise.</p>
      <p>Pokemon's broad offering spanning video games, movies and soft toys, has made the franchise a home-grown contender for a Disney-style pop-culture empire.</p>
      <p>That contrasts with Nintendo's tight grip over its characters, with moves to broaden its appeal including Super Nintendo World, a new attraction set to open at the Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka next year.</p>
      <p>The new outpost of Pokemon Center, which last month proved wildly popular when it opened a pop-up store in London, features black walls and graffiti-splashed Pikachu toys in a nod to its location in Shibuya - a street-fashion mecca.</p>
      <p>Parco's 6th floor also features stores from companies such as games maker Capcom Co Ltd.</p>
      <p>Nintendo's push to drive sales beyond hardcore gamers comes as two Pokemon titles received a positive reception when they launched for the Switch console last week, bringing a game with full Pokemon battling mechanics to the device for the first time.</p>
      <p>The game is expected to drive demand for the Switch and the lower-cost Switch Lite into the year-end shopping season.</p>
