      <h1>The Bristol streets affected by plans for a diesel car ban and clean air zone</h1>
      <h2>A new map shows the exact streets Bristol City Council wants to ban diesel cars from</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Cameron</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> has finally revealed the exact streets it wants to ban diesel cars from and charge polluting buses and taxis to enter.</p>
      <p>Three weeks after the authority first revealed its proposals to reduce air pollution in the city, it has provided a large map showing which streets are affected by its clean air plans.</p>
      <p>Its outline plans for an inner-city diesel car ban and wider clean air zone (CAZ) were submitted to the government on November 6.</p>
      <p>They are still subject to refinement, public consultation and government approval, so the details could change before they are finalised and implemented by March 2021. </p>
      <p>But, in the meantime, these are the details of the plans that have been drawn up to reduce Bristol’s levels of nitrogen dioxide to within legal limits as quickly as possible, as ordered by the government in 2017.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-diesel-ban-clean-air-3493961">All privately owned diesel vehicles</a> would be banned from 1.26 square miles of the inner city between 7am and 3pm. The ban would affect all privately owned diesel vehicles no matter how polluting they are, and would be in place seven days a week. <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/bristol-clean-air-zone-charges-3481155">A hefty fine would be applied if someone breached the ban</a>, but emergency service vehicles and taxis would be exempt.</p>
      <p>Older, more polluting commercial vehicles would be charged a daily fee to enter a surrounding clean air zone (CAZ) covering 5.61 square miles. The charge for vehicles not meeting Euro 6 (diesel) or Euro 4 (petrol emission standards) would be £9 a day for taxis and light-goods vehicles or £100 a day for buses and heavy-goods vehicles (HGVs).</p>
      <p>Commercial vehicles that are newer and cleaner, and those that have paid the charge to enter the CAZ, will be able to drive through the diesel ban zone.</p>
      <p>Other elements of the proposals include a scrappage scheme for diesel vehicles and a 7.5-tonne weight restriction on HGVs along the road past the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/hospital-patients-visitors-diesel-cars-3481137">Bristol Royal Infirmary and the Bristol Royal Children’s Hospital</a> from the top of Park Street to the Bearpit.</p>
      <p>Many of the details are still to be finalised, such as charges and penalties, exemptions for certain groups, and other ways to alleviate the worst effects of the scheme on individuals and businesses. </p>
      <p>But at this stage, the quirks of the proposed boundaries would see homes and businesses in dozens of roads affected differently depending on which end or side of the street they live on. </p>
      <p>For example, the northern end of Greenway Bush Lane in Southville, and one side of the street in particular, would be affected by the diesel car ban while the rest of the road would escape it.</p>

      <p>The diesel ban area is boot shaped.</p>
      <p>Its toe lies in Cumberland Basin, its heel in the Temple Gate area and its ankle up around the Bearpit.</p>
      <p>The sole follows the A370 along the south of the river along Coronation Road and York Road.</p>

      <p>The ban takes in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hotwells">Hotwells</a>, Canon’s Marsh, City Hall, College Green, Queen’s Square, the Christmas Steps, Cabot Circus, part of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/m32-motorway">M32</a>, and hundreds of homes in the inner city.</p>
      <p>It also includes roads that go past the BRI, the children’s hospital and Bristol <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/temple-meads">Temple Meads.</a></p>
      <p>At the toe end, the ban has two pointy extensions - one travelling northwards along the Portway and up Bridge Valley Road as far as Ladies Mile and the other extending southwards along the A3029 as far as Ashton Vale Road opposite <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ashton-gate">Ashton Gate.</a></p>
      <p>From Cumberland Basin, the northern border of the ban area - or the top of the boot - follows Hotwells Road and takes in the lower part of Jacob’s Wells Road before going past the bottom of Brandon Hill.</p>
      <p>It crosses Park Street at Great George Street before joining Park Row just past Woodland Road, and takes in the very bottom of St Michael’s Hill before continuing along Upper Maudlin Street and Marlborough Street to the Bearpit.</p>
      <p>This means that people wanting to get to the BRI and the children’s hospital would not be able to approach from the front entrance, but would be able to drive down St Michael’s Hill and along Horfield Road, past the entrance to the Bristol haematology and oncology centre and Bristol Heart Institute behind.</p>
      <p>From the Bearpit, the ban extends a short way into <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/stokes-croft">Stokes Croft</a> before continuing along the A4044 across the top of the ankle of the boot, taking in Cabot Circus and Temple Way.</p>

      <p>Before the boundary turns south along Bond Street to the Old Market roundabout, a spur of the ban extends eastwards along the city end of the M32 as far as the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/st-pauls">St Paul’s</a> junction.</p>
      <p>The ban also takes in a section of Old Market as far as Midland Road before heading southwards as far as the slip roads onto Bath Road just past the Bath Road Bridge roundabout.</p>
      <p>The Temple Circus roundabout and the Station Approach outside Bristol Temple Meads are included in the diesel ban area.</p>
      <p>The southern boundary of the ban - or sole of the boot - carries on westwards along the A370 south of the river back towards Cumberland Basin.</p>
      <p>On its way, it takes in the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bedminster">Bedminster</a> Bridge roundabout and a short stretch of Bedminster Parade.</p>
      <p>The ban zone means that people who live in south Bristol and want to drive a diesel car into north Bristol between 7am and 3pm must cross the river at the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/clifton-suspension-bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a> or <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/totterdown">Totterdown</a> Bridge. They could not drive through the city to get to hospital without incurring a hefty fine.</p>
      <p>The suspension bridge itself is not included in the diesel ban area or CAZ, but it passes through the “air space” of both zones as it crosses the Portway.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The CAZ</b>
      </p>
      <p>The clean air zone (CAZ) radiates out in all directions from the diesel ban area, except at the toe of the boot, where the boundaries overlap.</p>
      <p>It takes in parts of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/clifton">Clifton</a>, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/cotham">Cotham</a>, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/redland">Redland</a>, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/montpelier">Montpelier</a> and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bishopston">Bishopston</a> to the north, stretches as far as Stapleton Road railway station and St Philip’s Marsh to the east, and covers <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/southville">Southville</a>, Bedminster, Ashton Gate and Aston Vale in the south.</p>
      <p>Like the diesel ban, the CAZ extends north from Cumberland Basin along the Portway. But instead of going up Bridge Valley Road, it continues along the Portway towards <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avonmouth">Avonmouth</a> as far as Sylvan Way.</p>
      <p>This would affect industrial traffic from Avonmouth.</p>
      <p>From Cumberland Basin, the northern border of the CAZ runs past the top of Brandon Hill and takes in the Triangle and the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.</p>
      <p>It runs along Whiteladies Road as far as Clifton Down station before turning east and following the railway track as far as Redland Station.</p>
      <p>At Redland Station, it dives north to take in Redland Grove and other parts of Redland and Bishopston before crossing Gloucester Road at Berkeley Road.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This would mean that students and people catching taxis to the lower half of Gloucester Road for a night out could be charged more because of the fees that older, more polluting commercial vehicles would have to pay to enter the CAZ. </p>
      <p>From Gloucester Road, the northern border of the CAZ continues east but stops short of Mueller Road before heading south along the railway line to Stapleton Road station.</p>
      <p>The eastern boundary follows the railway line south towards Lawrence Hill station, but before it gets there, it heads southwest and crosses the A420 Church Road.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/lawrence-hill">Lawrence Hill</a> roundabout falls within the CAZ.</p>
      <p>The boundary continues south along the A4320, and takes in the elevated section of St Philips Causeway and St Philip’s Marsh before running west along the river.</p>
      <p>From Totterdown Bridge, the southern boundary of the CAZ runs southwest along the A4 Bath Road and follows the railway line north of Windmill Hill as far as Bedminster station.</p>
      <p>It continues southwest, cutting across Bedminster Road, Parson Street, and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hartcliffe">Hartcliffe</a> Way before heading west along South Liberty Lane and turning north towards Cumberland Basin.</p>
      <p>On its way north, the CAZ takes in Ashton Vale and follows the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset">North Somerset</a> border for a short stretch before following the A370 towards the Cumberland Basin system.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why has it taken so long to get the map?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Local Democracy Reporting Service requested details of the boundaries two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman said: “While there were numerous technical maps included in the Outline Business Case (OBC) detailing different elements of the plan, none were able to provide a clear picture of the information that was requested. </p>
      <p>“With the project team currently dealing with numerous requests relating to the plans, it took some time to sort. </p>
      <p>“The boundaries of the two zones are not final and could change as the plans develop.”</p>
