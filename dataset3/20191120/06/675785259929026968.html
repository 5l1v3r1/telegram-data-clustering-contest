      <p>Rag'n'Bone Man and his wife Beth Rouy have reportedly called it quits - six months after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rag-n-bone-man-marries-14992408">getting married</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10381247/rag-n-bone-man-splits-wife/">The Sun</a> say that it's all over between the singer and his new wife.</p>
      <p>The music star, real name Rory Graham, wed Beth in Sussex in May. They wore tracksuits, shunning shoes, ties and shirts and ordered guests to dress relaxed.</p>
      <p>But it appears they couldn't make it work despite being together for more than ten years.</p>
      <p>The pair share son Reuben, two, are it is claimed they have decided to just be 'close friends'.</p>

      <p>A source has claimed: "It’s a great shame, but these things happen. Everyone is staying amicable, and they have a son together who is their top priority.</p>
      <p>"He likes to keep a low profile so doesn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but there are no explosive rows and he isn’t likely to say anything about it.</p>
      <p>"It looks like it’s a very sad end to what was a very loving and long-term relationship.</p>

      <p>"The wedding pictures show what a quirky couple they were, which makes how this has ended so soon even more heartbreaking."</p>
      <p>In June he spoke about married life, saying: “It’s great, man.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been together for ten years anyway so it’s exactly the same. We’ve just got the same name now.”</p>
      <p>The Human hitmaker is now worth almost £3.1million - even after splashing out £1million on a new home.</p>

      <p>Figures for his company, Ne Oublie Limited – which is French for “Don’t Forget” – show assets in the firm rocketed from £1.8million to £4.2million.</p>
