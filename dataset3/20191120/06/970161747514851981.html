      <p>These are the tar-blackened lungs of a chain smoker who puffed on a packet of cigarettes a day for 30 years.</p>
      <p>Doctors shared footage of an operation being carried out on the smoker after he died at the age of just 52 as a result of lung diseases.</p>
      <p>Instead of being a healthy pink colour, they had turned charcoal and were extremely inflamed.</p>
      <p>The patient had signed up to be an organ donor, but as a result of his smoking addiction they could not use them.</p>
      <p>Dr Chen uploaded the footage from Wuxi People’s Hospital in Jiangsu, China with the hashtag ‘jieyan’, which means quit smoking.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘Many smokers in this country have lungs which look like this.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Our team decided to reject these lungs for transplant. If you’re a heavy smoker, your lungs may not be accepted even if you choose to donate them after death.</p>
      <p>‘Look at these lungs – do you still have the courage to smoke?’</p>
      <p>More than a quarter of people in China are believed to be smokers.</p>
      <p>Dr Chen added: ‘The patient didn’t undergo a CT scan before his death. He was declared brain dead, and his lungs were donated shortly after that.</p>
      <p>‘Initial oxygenation index tests were okay, but when we harvested the organs, we realised we wouldn’t be able to use them.</p>

      <p>‘We Chinese love smoking. It would be impractical to say that we wouldn’t accept the lungs of all smokers, but there are strict standards.</p>
      <p>‘[We would accept] lungs from people under 60 years of age who have only recently died, minor infections in the lungs and relatively clean X-rays are also acceptable. If the above conditions are met, we would consider transplanting the lungs.’</p>
      <p>The patient had suffered from lung lung pulmonary emphysema, which causes the organs to become severely inflamed and expand, and makes sufferers short of breath.</p>
      <h3>Why you should quit smoking</h3>
      <p>We spoke to Dr Alexandra Phelan, a working NHS GP and Online Doctor with <a href="https://www.pharmacy2u.co.uk/">Pharmacy2U</a>, who explains some of the immediate and long-term benefits of giving up smoking.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Dr Phelan told <a href="http://metro.co.uk/">Metro.co.uk:</a> ‘Lung capacity can improve by up to 10% within nine months of quitting.</p>
      <p>‘Circulation is likely to improve, making physical activity easier and you’ll probably have more energy because the oxygen boost to your blood reduces tiredness.</p>
      <p>‘Non-smokers are more likely to get pregnant, with improvements to the womb lining and potency of sperm and also benefit from enhanced senses, as taste and smell are no longer dulled by toxic chemicals.’</p>

      <h3>So how do I stop smoking?</h3>
      <p>There’s a few ways you can quit smoking and not every way suits everybody. Some people prefer to go cold turkey while others need aids to wean them off the nicotine.</p>
      <p>Before you consider those though, you’d be surprised how following these simple NHS tips will set you on the right path to quitting cigarettes altogether.</p>
      <p><b>Think positively:</b> A major part of giving up smoking is thinking positively. You may have tried quitting before and failed but don’t let that put you off. Instead, think about what you did wrong and how you can go about it this time.</p>
      <h3>NHS support helpline</h3>
      <p>
        <b>You can find your nearest NHS stop smoking service on the <a href="http://smokefree.nhs.uk/?WT.mc_id=search&amp;gclid=CM6-4arGnJ8CFVtn4wodyD8pIw">NHS Smokefree website</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Or you can call the Smokefree National Helpline on 0300 123 1044.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Make a plan, stick to it:</b> Make an actual promise to yourself that you will quit smoking. Then stick to it. Set a date and stick it on your fridge.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>If you find yourself having cravings, repeat ‘I will not have even a single drag’ until the cravings pass.</p>
      <p>Plan for scenarios where it might be difficult to say no too, like a party.</p>
      <p>As Dr Phelan advises, if you’re in a sociable environment, try putting a drink in the hand that usually holds a cigarette.You can also drink from a straw to keep your hands and mouth busy.</p>
      <p><b>Consider your diet: </b>If your after-dinner cigarette is your favourite, change your routine, Dr Phelan says. Getting up and doing the dishes straight away or going for a walk will help to keep you occupied.</p>
      <p>According to a US study, some foods such as meat, make cigarettes more satisfying. Others, including cheese, fruit and vegetables, make cigarettes taste terrible.</p>
      <p>So swap your usual steak or burger for a veggie pizza instead.</p>
      <p><b>Change what you drink: </b> Fizzy drinks, alcohol, coke, tea and coffee all make cigarettes taste better. So when you’re out, drink more water and juice.</p>
      <p>Some people find simply changing their drink quenches their cravings.</p>
      <h3>How much money can I save if I give up smoking?</h3>
      <p>The average smoker could stand to save £250 each month by kicking the habit, which adds up to about £3,000 a year.</p>
      <p>Find out how much you could save by stopping smoking with <a href="https://www.pushdoctor.co.uk/smoking/quit-smoking-calculator">this handy calculator</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Let your family and friends know you’re quitting: </b>When you decide to make the decision to quit, tell your friends and family immediately.</p>
      <p>As Dr Peter Petrie, from <a href="http://your-doctor.co.uk/">Your Doctor</a> tells us: ‘The first week without cigarettes is normally the hardest in terms of cravings. If your friends are aware of your plans they will find ways to be more considerate of your choice.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Perhaps make sure you make lots of non-smoking plans with friends to keep you busy.’</p>
      <p><b>Reasons to quit: </b>Write down a list of reasons for why you would like to quit. Then, when you have the cravings, reminds yourself of those reasons. Chances are, you’ll put that cigarette back down. </p>

      <h3>I still need help, what support is out there?</h3>
      <p>Some people choose to do it alone, others may need a little more of a helping hand.</p>
      <p>Luckily, there is a lot out there to help, such as therapy, medicine and specific treatments available from shops, pharmacies and on prescription to help you beat your addiction and reduce withdrawal symptoms.</p>
      <h4>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)</h4>
      <p>NRT works as medication by providing you with a low level of nicotine but without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke (the bad stuff, basically).</p>
      <p>By taking just a small dose of nicotine, you can drastically reduce those unpleasant withdrawal effects that come with quitting smoking.</p>
      <p>It comes in a variety of different forms and there’s no evidence that any single type of NRT is more effective than another.</p>
      <p>But it has been found that using a combination of NRT is more effective than using a single product.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You can find NRT in:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>skin patches – these release nicotine slowly.</li>
        <li>chewing gum – this helps to alleviate cravings and is more short term.</li>
        <li>inhalators (which look like plastic cigarettes)</li>
        <li>tablets, oral strips and lozenges</li>
        <li>nasal and mouth spray</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can try NiQuitin products, which include lozenges, patches and gums, and can be found at Boots, Superdrug, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Lloyds, Morrisons. Visit <a href="http://www.niquitin.co.uk/products/quit-smoking">www.niquitin.co.uk</a> for more information.</p>
      <p>Treatment with NRT usually lasts 8-12 weeks, before you gradually reduce the dose and eventually stop.</p>
      <p>It is advisable to visit a doctor before starting NRT, especially if you have kidney or liver problems<b>,</b> or you’ve recently had a heart attack or stroke.</p>

      <h4>E-cigarettes</h4>
      <p>Over the past few years, electronic cigarettes have become very popular among people wanting to quit smoking.</p>
      <p>Known as e-cigarettes, the device allows you to inhale nicotine without most of the harmful effects of smoking.</p>
      <h3>Smoking fact</h3>
      <p>Research shows that you’re <b>four times</b> more likely to succeed if you quit via a Stop Smoking service.</p>
      <p>They work by heating and creating a vapour from a solution that typically contains nicotine; a thick, colourless liquid called propylene glycol and/or glycerine; and flavourings.</p>
      <p>Because there is no burning involved, there is no smoke.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/smoking/Pages/e-cigarettes.aspx">NHS site</a>, in the year up to April 2015, two out of three people who used e-cigarettes in combination with the NHS stop smoking service quit smoking successfully.</p>
      <h4>Varenicline (Champix)</h4>
      <p>Varenicline (also known by its brand name Champix) is a medication that reduces nicotine cravings and blocks the rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking.</p>
      <p>It is considered the most effective medication for helping people stop smoking.</p>
      <p>It’s prescription-only so if you decide to pursue this path, see your GP or contact an NHS stop smoking service to get it.</p>
      <p>It consists of taking one to two tablets a day and should be started a week or two before you try to quit.</p>
      <p>A course of treatment usually lasts around 12 weeks, but it can be continued for longer if necessary.</p>
      <p>Most people can take it, however it is not suitable for children under 18, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and people with severe kidney problems.</p>

      <h4>Bupropion (Zyban)</h4>
      <p>Bupropion (also known by its brand name Zyban) is a medication usually used to treat depression but evidence has shown that it helps people to quit smoking.</p>
      <p>It is said to have an effect on the parts of the brain involved in addictive behaviour.</p>
      <p>It is prescription-only and you take one to two tablets a day. Like Varenicline, you should start taking it a week or two before you try to quit.</p>
      <p>A course of treatment usually lasts around seven to nine weeks.</p>
