      <p>Hacked is an edge of the seat gripping thriller and as the name suggests, it explores a very topical issue – the dark side of the digital and the social media world.</p>
      <p>In our times we have become what we google. We are the sum of our google history. What should happen if someone gets a hand on it?</p>
