      <p>Lewis Westwood, previously of Hillbrook Road, Leyland, was jailed at Preston Crown Court for eight years in 2014 for grievous bodily harm with intent.</p>
      <p>David Clarke, prosecuting, said Westwood had been recalled to prison on March 8 last year for breaching his licence conditions following his release from that term.</p>

      <p>He said he absconded from open conditions at HMP Kirkham on August 4.</p>
      <p>Westwood was on the run for 10 weeks before his arrest in Leyland on October 19.</p>
      <p>Preston Crown Court was told at the time, his mother was also serving a jail term, and he said he had received threats due to what she had been doing and feared his sister would be subjected to violence.</p>
      <p>Judge Robert Altham said: “It’s right to say he was at large for a long period of time which I take to be significant aggravating feature of this case.</p>
      <p>He imposed eight months in prison, which will be served alongside Westwood’s existing term.</p>
      <p>He is due to be released in January 2022 from the jail term for the paramedic attack.</p>
