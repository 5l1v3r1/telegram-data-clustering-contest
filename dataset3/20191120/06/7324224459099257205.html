      <p>The TUC said since the start of the decade, child poverty in working families across the region rose by 108,006 (56 per cent) to almost 300,000 – the second biggest rise in the country outside London.</p>
      <p>In the UK child poverty in working families went up by 38 per cent to 2.9 million, according to the research.</p>
      <p>In 2010, one in five children in working households were growing up in poverty, but by 2018 this had increased to one in four, the trade union found.</p>
      <p>The TUC claims that government policies going back to the Conservative-Li Dem coalition have accounted for most of the in-work poverty increase.</p>
      <p>Its findings have been described as "shameful" by Labour's Wolverhampton South West candidate Eleanor Smith, who said: "These are families where parents have to choose between putting the heating on, or giving their family a proper meal</p>
      <p>"Families who suffer the constant stress of trying to pay off debts. Families who can’t afford school trips, or to travel to see relatives just a few towns away.</p>
      <p>"We’re one of the richest countries in the world – things don’t have to be like this."</p>
      <p>Ms Smith claimed her party's pledge of a £10-an-hour living wage would end in-work poverty "for everyone, immediately".</p>
      <p>The TUC report added that weak wage growth and "insecure work" were also factors behind the rise in child poverty.</p>
      <p>TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: "No child in Britain should be growing up in poverty, but millions of parents are struggling to feed and clothe their kids.</p>
      <p>"The Conservatives’ cuts to in-work benefits have come at a terrible human cost. As too has their failure to tackle insecure work and get wages rising across the economy.</p>
      <p>"We need a government that puts working families first, not wealthy donors and hedge funds."</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have pledged to prioritise tackling poverty.</p>
      <p>The TUC figures were compiled by Landman Economics, which is run by Howard Reed, a former chief economist at the left-wing think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research.</p>
