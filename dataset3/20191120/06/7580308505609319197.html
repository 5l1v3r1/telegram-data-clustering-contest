      <p>ASAP Rocky who spent a month behind bars in Sweden has decided to go back to the country and his reason for going back is to help the inmates and immigrants he met there.</p>
      <p>As reported by TMZ, ASAP says the month in jail for his assault case opened his eyes to the plight of immigrants. He says he was especially aware of the support he was getting, as a celeb, while some prisoners around him were rotting for 10 months or more before seeing a judge.</p>
      <p>He’s on a mission to change that. ASAP confirms he will be donating proceeds from his December 11 concert in Stockholm to an immigrant rights organisation called FARR, the Swedish Network of Refugee Support Groups.</p>
      <p>Two months ago, Rocky was held in inhumane conditions while prosecutors decided whether to charge him for aggravated assault stemming from a street brawl.</p>
      <p>The case drew worldwide attention, even President Trump and his administration got involved.</p>
      <p>A$AP was ultimately found guilty but did not have to serve any more time behind bars. Rocky wasted no time leaving Sweden.</p>
      <p>He made it obvious then that he will not be returning to Sweden until Live Nation announced he’d be returning to Sweden next month.</p>
