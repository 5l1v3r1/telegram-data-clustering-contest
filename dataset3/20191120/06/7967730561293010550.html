      <h1>ASX suffers biggest fall since early October</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:25:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:25</time> by <a rel="author">David Scutt</a></address>
      <p>Weighed down by geopolitical tensions between the United States and China and steep falls in financials, local shares tumbled on Wednesday, logging the largest one-day fall since October 3.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 91.8 points, or 1.4 per cent, to close at 6722.4 points, unwinding sharply after closing within 1 per cent of a record high on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>“The emergence of new <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53cgp.html">trade war risks</a> sparked relatively heavy selling,” IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda told clients. “Volumes are high with a clear conviction in the market underpinning this sell-off.”</p>
      <p>Financials tumbled 2.2 per cent, undermined by news AUSTRAC has launched legal proceedings against <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53c8o.html">Westpac Bank</a> allegeing it breached Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws 23 million times.</p>
      <p>Westpac skidded 3.3 per cent to $25.67. The other major banks were also pressured with the Commonwealth, ANZ and NAB all sliding between 1.3 and 3.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>Aside from consumer discretionary which rose 0.5 per cent, all other sectors finished lower with industrials, utilities, energy, healthcare and REITs all declining more than 1 per cent.</p>

      <p>Communications and materials fell 0.9 per cent apiece, consumer staples 0.7 per cent while information technology finished flat.</p>
      <p>ALS Limited was the top performer, soaring 12.1 per cent to $9.06 after its full-year profit beat guidance. In contrast, Saracen Minerals skidded 8.9 per cent to $3.03 after a discounted equity raising.</p>
      <p>Outside of the major banks, all other stocks in the S&amp;P/ASX 20 – the largest companies by market cap – finished in the red.</p>
      <p>CSL fell 1.5 per cent to $270.17, Macquarie Group 2 per cent to $135.03, Goodman Group 2.4 per cent to $14.44 while South32 slid 1.9 per cent to $2.64.</p>
